PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER ROSE, D. D.  

ALEXANDER CLARK, J- MINISTERS.  
ROBERT MACPHERSON, j 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — From the earliest periods, this parish seems to have 
borne its present name, which is Celtic, and is supposed to refer 
to the celebrated Fall of Foyers, which discharges its streams into 
Loch Ness, {Loch 'an Ess, i. e. the Lake of the Cataract, and 
thence through the River Ness to the sea. 

Extent, Sj-c. — The parish stretches along the coast of the Moray 
Frith, and its prolongation the Beauly Frith. Its length, from 
north-east to south-west, is 14 miles; and its average breadth about 
2i. It is bounded on the north-east by the friths ; on the west 
by the parishes of Kirkhill, Kiltarlity, and Urquhart; south-west 
by Loch Ness and the parish of Dores ; south and south-east by the 
parishes of Daviot and Croy; and on the east by the parish of 
Petty. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish of Inverness consists 
chiefly of the eastmost portion of the great Caledonian valley, or 
" Great Glen of Albin," as it lies between the basin of the Moray 
Frith, which is the prolongation of that opening, and the waters of 
Loch Ness. It is also flanked on each side by the terminating 
chains of mountains which bound the Great Glen, and which con- 
stitute the only rocky or hilly parts of the parish. The surface 
of the valley, which is smooth and but little elevated above the pre- 
sent level of the sea, except where diversified by the alluvial hil- 
locks and terraces afterwards described, contains, of course, the 
richest and best cultivated lands in the parish. 

The mountains of the Great Glen, as they approach the east

coast, gradually decrease in height and asperity ; and those on the 
southern side especially, as they enter this parish, subside into a 
smooth elevated ridge about 400 feet high, which ultimately tapers 
off, and loses itself among the flat sandstone plains of Nairnshire. 
On the opposite side, the granitic mountains which occur at the 
north-eastern extremity of Loch Ness are succeeded by an ex- 
tremely rough but picturesque group of sandstone and conglome- 
rate hills, which reach to the adjoining frith, and end in the well- 
known vitrified site of Craig Phadric, lying immediately to the west 
of the town of Inverness, and distinguished by its beautiful tabu- 
lar summit, and a succession of bold rocky escarpments along its 
acclivities. 

The environs of Inverness are well cultivated, and adorned with 
a profusion of woods and young plantations, and the distant view 
is in all directions except towards the east, where the eye is greet- 
ed by the waters of the Moray Frith, closed in with screens of 
mountains greatly diversified in height and outline. 

The coast-line of this parish takes several extensive bends or 
sweeps ; and the adjoining flats are throughout highly cultivated, 
presenting a considerable breadth of corn land, with the exception 
of a portion westward of the village of Clachnaherry, where a rocky 
cliff rises abruptly from the shore, leaving but a narrow slip of ground 
between it and the sea. Two large bays lie to the east and west of 
the town of Inverness, and between them the River Ness empties 
itself on the right of the narrow strait called Kessock Ferry, which 
separates Inverness from Ross-shire, and the Moray Frith from 
the inner basin of Loch Beauly, or the Beauly Frith. 

Meteorology. — The climate of this parish, which is much influ- 
enced by the nature of its soil and position, is on the whole dry and 
salubrious. The lower parts of the parish are warm, being well 
sheltered by trees; the heights are cold and exposed, but they have 
been much improved of late by drainage and planting. As the moun- 
tains, which lie to the south and west, intercept much of the va- 
pour which rises from the Atlantic Ocean, and bestows a peculiarly 
damp character on the climate of the west coast, so in like man- 
ner the inland position of this parish, with respect to the German 
Ocean, protects it from suffering so much as some of the adjoin- 
ing districts, by the raw and boisterous easterly winds which pre- 
vail in this country during spring, and the first months of summer. 

The west wind is here the most frequent and warmest, and yields 

4

the greatest quantity of moisture ; but the number of rainy days 
at this end of the Great Glen is about sixty less than at Fort- Wil- 
liam on the opposite shore. Rain is here speedily absorbed by the 
light gravelly soil, which is another cause of the comparative dry- 
ness of the climate. The great bodies of fresh water, however, 
which occupy so large a portion of the surface of Inverness-shire, are 
continually sending up immense quantities of mist and watery va- 
pour from their surface, and as these become immediately con- 
densed and attracted to the sides and summits of the mountains, 
Inverness in consequence presents peculiar advantages to the stu- 
dent of atmospheric phenomena. In spring especially, great 
volumes of mist arise from Loch Ness, which is itself about 24 
miles long, nearly 2 miles broad, and in some places 115 fathoms 
deep, and are hurried by the winds to the eastern sea, whence 
they descend in fertile showers on the neighbouring lands. After 
a snow storm, these vapoury columns, particularly about the com- 
mencement of a thaw, assume the most fantastic forms, and as 
their warmth gradually removes the white covering of the moun- 
tains, long parallel streaks and lines of black appear on their sides 
and summits, indicating the course and relative temperatures of the 
prevailing currents of wind. 

During winter, our sea coast becomes the haunt of great num- 
bers of wild geese, ducks, herons, and cormorants, and occasionally 
of a few wild swans, and foreign birds. A few years ago the com- 
mon plover was known to nestle in the lower parts of the district, 
but now it is rarely seen but in the highest grounds. 

Hydrography. — Most of the observations under this head appli- 
cable to the parish of Inverness are already embraced in the fore ■ 
going details. It is only necessary to add, that there are many 
perennial springs of pure water in the district, but few medicinal 
or otherwise distinguished. The Ness is the only river which flows 
through the parish. Its course from its parent lake to the sea is 
about 8 rniles long ; its channel gravelly, and about 60 yards wide, 
with a uniform inclination, giving to the river a gentle but equable 
flow, and hence it affords peculiar advantages to the erection of 
mills and manufactures. Its average depth is in summer about 3 
feet, in winter 6 or 7 feet. The water of the River Ness possesses 
a purgative quality on persons unaccustomed to drink it. This pro- 
perty appears to be owing to decomposed vegetable matter, and to 
result from Confervse and Mosses, which its high temperature keeps

continually growing in its channel, and not to the influence of the 
tide, as many have supposed. 

Some of the burns, such as those of Inches, Holm, Dochfour, 
and Aberiachan, display small but beautiful waterfalls, associated 
with hazel copses and woodland scenery ; but none of them are so 
large as to merit particular description. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The greater portion of the Highlands 
of Scotland consists of rocks of the oldest or primary class, that is, 
of such as have a highly crystalline structure, and are entirely de- 
void of organic remains or petrifactions. Where stratified or re- 
gularly disposed, the beds or strata usually maintain a course from 
south-west to north-east, are vertical or highly inclined to the 
horizon, but without any constant dip or position. Parallel to the 
prevailing direction of the strata, the mountains generally run in 
lines from south-west to north-east, with great longitudinal valleys 
or straths between them, into which the waters of the ocean have 
penetrated, forming large bays and friths ; or the surfaces of the 
valleys are occupied by a succession of fresh water lakes united to- 
gether, and with the sea, by winding streams and rivulets. Lesser 
valleys, called glens and passes, traverse the mountain chains, or 
stretch along their rocky sides ; and it is generally among these 
that the most picturesque scenery, and most beautiful and romantic 
castles and seats of the Highland gentry, and hamlets of their te- 
nants, are to be seen. 

Towards the south-western boundary of the Highlands, mica, 
chlorite, and clay slates prevail; in the north, and especially in In- 
verness-shire, and the counties beyond it, gneiss is the most abun- 
dant rock ; and throughout and far above it, enormous masses of 
granite and of the oldest trap or porphyritic rocks shoot up,— such 
as the Grampians, and the alps of Glencoe and Ben- Nevis. 

On this great nucleus of primary rock, deposits of secondary 
strata, distinguished chiefly by their fragmentary structure and the 
presence of organic remains, both animal and vegetable, and con- 
sisting for the most part of sandstones, shales and limestones, re- 
pose. They are found on both sides of the island, and at its 
northern extremity. The secondary deposit on the eastern coast 
seems at one time to have filled the great basin of the Moray Frith, 
and to have extended far out into the German Ocean. Its re- 
mains may still be traced from the mouth of the River Spey in a 
continuous line along the coast to the westward and northward, ex-

tending inland from 1 to 6 miles, and in the Great Glen even 18 
miles from the sea; and abutting against the primary mountains, 
where the formation terminates in highly inclined strata, or thick 
shapeless masses of a coarse semi-crystalline breccia or conglome- 
rate. In Caithness, this secondary deposit developes itself in 
great horizontal sheets of rock, uninterrupted by primitive masses, 
and constitutes almost the whole of that champaign county, and 
the greater portion of the adjoining Orkneys. 

As already noticed, this secondary formation consists chiefly of 
sandstones and limestones, which are probably of several different 
geological eras. Thus a ridge of coarse conglomerate is usu- 
ally found on its inner margin next the primitive masses, from 
which undulating ridges' and plains of softer rock extend towards 
the sea. But on the coast, and in the centre of the deposit, other 
masses of conglomerate sometimes appear ; and between them and 
the interior conglomerates, layers of a dark and soft argillaceous 
schist, abounding with bituminous matter, and occasionally with 
scales and impressions of extinct fishes, also interpose in some 
places. The latter, in general, lie on soft red sandstone. Hence 
the question arises, are both the conglomerate ridges of the same 
aira, and the argillaceoua schists of the same formation with the 
sandstones ; or are the former here the substitutes of the true coal 
deposits, and the latter of the old red sandstone of Werner  

So far as has yet been ascertained, it would appear, that the con- 
glomerate zone next the primary rocks may be classed as of the 
age of the old red sandstone ; but, on the other hand, some of the 
exterior conglomerate ridges and sandstone beds reclining on them 
belong to the new red or variegated sandstone deposit. On the 
latter, also, as a base, members of the lias and oolite formations 
have been deposited, of which a few beds still remain, as at thie 
and Shandwick in Ross-shire, Brora in Sutherland, and on the 
Morayshire coast eastward of Burgh-head. They appear to have 
constituted the superior beds of a great basin of rock stretching 
across the Moray Frith, but which has been almost entirely wash- 
ed away by the encroachments of the sea. At Brora, these upper 
strata further display an unusual connection of coal with the lias 
formation ; and in the same vicinity also they exhibit a very inte- 
resting example of the intrusion of granite among secondary de- 
posits, and of the consequent fracture and dislocation of the latter. 

The foregoing details are necessary as an introduction to the 
short notice that now remains to be made of the rocks composing

the hills in the vicinity of Inverness, — as, without a knowledge of 
the general structure of the country, it would be exceedingly diffi- 
cult for an observer to understand the true position of the rocky 
constituents of this district. 

The oldest sandstone deposit above-mentioned stretches along 
the ridge of the Leys, on the south side of this parish, towards 
Loch Ness, where it terminates near the Fall of Foyers on ledges 
of a gray sienitic granite. Between the softer sandstone and the 
granite, a high rugged chain of conglomerate hills is interposed, 
which the reader will find particularly described in the account of 
the parish of Dores. 

On the opposite side of the Great Glen the sandstones do not 
penetrate so far inland. They may be traced, however, from the 
village of Clachnaherry, at the entrance of the Caledonian Canal, 
to the burn of Dochnalurg, or Dochgarroch, about eight miles 
south-west from the town of Inverness, where they are met by 
primary gneiss and granite. The sandstone in this line is soft, of 
a dark red colour, and it dips towards the south-east, or the centre 
of the adjoining valley. It is caped by great masses of coarse 
conglomerate, cut into beautiful rounded or rather tabular sum- 
mits, with bold rocky sides ; and a minute inspection of these de- 
monstrates that they have been greatly shattered and uplifted from 
their original positions by the neighbouring granite rocks, which, 
in fact, in one place close by Clachnaherry pier appear in a 
cliff' immediately beneath them. There the sandstone is super- 
imposed in thin strata, occasionally vertical in their position, but 
generally greatly contorted and waved like curved gneiss, and 
hardened where in immediate contact with the granite.  In the 
ridge of the Leys the sandstone strata have not been similarly 
affected. The layers, however, are considerably inchned to the 
horizon, and dip towards the north-east, a direction opposite to 
that of the beds on the other side of the valley. Indeed, it is ge- 
nerally the case that the rocks on the several sides of the Moray, 
Beauly, and Cromarty Friths dip in different directions, as if 
bearing towards a central plain, from which they have been upheav- 
ed. The sandstone of the Leys has many of its beds of a light blue 
colour, with an intermixture of micaceous scales and limestone. It 
is quarried and used as a building stone in Inverness. Prismatic 
calcareous spar, steatite, and heavy spar, abound in this stone. In

several places the fundamental rock is covered with layers of the 
above-mentioned dark-coloured argillaceous schist, above which 
we ao-ain meet with newer sandstone strata. 

So far as seen in this parish one would be apt to conclude, that 
the schist was only an alternating bed with the sandstone, and of 
the same era with it ; but, on comparing it with the same deposits 
in the more open districts of Ross and Caithness, the schist swells 
out to an enormous extent, separating the sandstones by a wide in- 
terval, thereby giving countenance to the supposition, that the three 
are of different geological ages. The superior sandstone also pos- 
sesses more of the soft and spotted features of the new red or va- 
riegated formation of that rock than the lower beds; but data seem 
yet awanting to enable us to pronounce positively as to their diffe- 
rence or identity. 

In regard to the schist, its distinguishing characters are its abound- 
ing with bituminous matter minutely disseminated throughout it, 
and which is sometimes found in lumps or veins of compact bitu- 
men, and its occasionally containing, especially in Caithness, im- 
pressions of fishes. It has a fetid smell, and white streak, and 
has often been mistaken for the true bituminous shale of the coal 
formation, in consequenceof which an unfortunate attempt in search 
of coal was once made in this parish. 

As yet no organic remains have been found in the rocks of this 
district, no metallic ores of any value, and no trap or porphyry 
rocks. The sandstone strata appear to be free of fissures and 
veins, and when the latter do occur, they are generally granitic. 

Alluvial deposits. — But the most interesting geological appear- 
ances in this parish and the adjoining districts are unquestionably 
their sand and gravel beds. The neighbouring mountains are co- 
vered almost to their summits with deep gravelly deposits ; the 
Great Glen has been partially filled up by them, and the necks or 
portions of land separating its various lakes are formed of the same 
materials. Hence the presence of the sea or of some other great 
body of water over the dry land is perhaps more unequivocally de- 
monstrated, and that on a larger scale, in this quarter than in any 
other place in Scotland. 

The elevation of the surface of Loch Ness above the sea is only 
46 feet; the intervening space, a distance of about eight miles, 
being entirely composed of gravel, which extends to an unknown 
depth ; and the River Ness flows through this deposit over a chan- 
nel slightly inclined towards the coast. A gravel terrace rises from 



8 



INVERNESS-SHIllE. 



its southern bank about 90 feet in height, which may be traced al- 
most in a direct Hue from Loch Ness to the town of Inverness, be- 
hind which it turns to the eastward, and stretches along the edge 
of the Moray Frith to Campbelltown, and thence through Nairn 
and Morayshires, nearly to the estuary of the river Spey. 

Westward of Inverness, a terrace bank of the same elevation 
encircles Loch Beauly, and traces of it may be seen along the 
Ross-shire coast as far down as Fortrose and Rosemarkie. The 
breadth of the terrace at Inverness is about a mile and a-half, and 
its elevation corresponds very nearly with the summit level of the 
Great Glen, which is situated at Laggan, between the lakes Oich 
and Lochy. Marine remains have been discovered in various places 
at the base of this bank, which is about ten feet above the pre- 
sent high water-mark, and its summit perhaps indicates the height 
at which the sea at one time stood throughout the whole basin of 
tha Moray Frith. 

On the west bank of the River Ness this regularly formed terrace 
bank does not exist. There the gravelly materials were more con- 
fusedly thrown together, and, in fact, from the end of Loch Doch- 
four, the lower basin of Loch Ness, a series of undulating knolls, 
composed of sand and gravel, proceeds, which terminate in the 
beautifully shaped ridge of Tor a'Bhean, which is nearly .300 feet 
in height, and lies about a mile to the south-west of Inverness. 

Between this ridge and Craig Phadrich on the north, a wide bay 
or opening appears to have been formed by currents of water with 
gravelly deposits; but that the cavity now existing was at one time 
filled up, seems clear from the occurrence of a broad shelf or ter- 
race lying near its upper edge, behind the farm-houses of Kinmy- 
lies and Charlestown, at an elevation of 330 feet above the sea. 

The house of Dunain stands on a similar terrace to the west- 
ward, but which is not quite so high as that just alluded to. 
- Detached from all other eminences, but in front of Tor a'Bhean, 
and in the line where the Great Glen meets the recess or bay just 
described, stands the insulated and very conspicuous hill of Tom- 
nahurich, which is as interesting from its singular position and re- 
gular form, as from the important occurrences in the history of the 
parish with which its name is connected. It was in ancient days used 
both as a watch or ward hill, and a place for dispensing justice ; 
and, being the great gathering hill of the fairies in the north, its 
broad and level summit and smooth green sides waving with hare-

bell, broom, and braken, afforded them ample space and seclusion 
for their elvish orgies. 

All the alluvial deposits novp enumerated consist of rounded frag- 
ments of rocks, chiefly from the neighbouring primary district, and 
varying in size from the minutest particles of sand to that of large 
boulders several feet in circumference. They are sometimes dis- 
posed in alternate layers of fine and coarse sand and gravel, but 
most frequently in thick horizontal beds of gravel, having the boul- 
der stones confusedly mixed throughout them. In some instances 
the layers repose on one another in beautifully curved lines, shovi- 
ing that they were in motion when first brought in contact. The 
direction also of the currents from which they were deposited ap- 
pears generally to have been from south-west to north-east, as the 
writer has recognized among the gravel beds at Inverness fragments 
of the peculiar and well known porphyries of Glencoe and Ben- 
Nevis, and of the very hard semi-crystalline conglomerate occur- 
ring near the Fall of Foyers.  

It is remarkable that no pecuhar simple minerals or gems have 
hitherto been found in these gravel beds, nor any organic remains 
or petrifactions, or even recent marine deposits. No human bones, 
nor bones of deer or other animals, have been met with at any con- 
siderable depth beneath the surface ; and in the excavations for 
the Caledonian Canal, the foreign substances found in the eravel 
were a few roots and stems of very large oak trees, some of which 
measured 24 feet in circumference. From these facts, we appear 
to be warranted in assigning a very high antiquity to the gravel beds 
of this neighbourhood, and to the belief that they were deposited 
from fresh, and not from salt water. 

Soil — Finally, as might be expected from the foregoing geolo- 
gical details, the superior soil of this parish is light and sandy, with 
a subsoil of hard gravel. In the vicinity of the town of Inverness, 
however, it is enriched with a fine loam of clay deposited from the 
river, or cast up by the waters of the adjoining frith. The collec- 
tions of water which anciently covered the district appear also to 
have left a light clayish sediment even on the higher grounds, which 
has greatly improved their otherwise gritty and unproductive soil. 

Botan7/.~The writer has remarked that the indigenous Flora of 

• The conclusion here alluded to is further supported by the fact, tliat a peculiar 
flesh-coloured granite, composing some of the hills between the rivers Findhorn and 
Nairn, is found in small masses strewed over all the plains of Morayshire, but no- 
where to the westward of CuUoden ; and that an uncommon variety of gneiss, of a 
very large grain, occurring in the central districts of Ross-shire, has been carried to 
the shores of the Dornoch Fritli, but not to the western sea.

this parish are generally about two weeks later of coming into 
bloom than the same plants are about Edinburgh, and about an 
equal period earlier than in the north of Caithness and Orkney. 
Our woods and meadows yield much the same species as the 
neighbourhood of our Scottish metropolis, with some rather pecu- 
liar ones, such as Prunus padus, Paris quadrifolia, Linncea bo- 
realis, Pyrola rotundifolia, media, minor and secunda, together 
with OrchidioB in great number and variety ; — while the herbage of 
the upper plains contains very many truly Alpine plants. The 
woods and rocks abound with mosses, fungi, and lichens ; but the 
algae and other marine productions are here few and stunted, 
owing to the inland position of the coast and the freshness of the 
water, occasioned by the influx of the rivers Ness and Beauly. 
The following is a list of the herbaceous plants found within the 
wooded region about Loch Ness, which to the botanist will be 
sufficiently characteristic of the warmth and fertility of our soil and 
climate. Piniis sylvestris, Betula alba, Taxus baccata, Cratcngus

11. — Civil History. 
During the reign of the early Scottish monarchs, subsequent to 
the union of the Picts and Scots, their power was but little known 
or respected in the Highlands; and it was not till the reign of James 
I., a. d. 1424, that the districts north of the Grampians were 
subjected to any thing like due obedience to kingly or national laws. 
Under the exclusive dominion of separate independent Celtic 
maormors and Saxon and Norman feudal warriors, but little is 
known of the condition or history of the Highland tribes, except 
from brief records preserved chiefly by ecclesiastics, of their in- 
roads upon the more .settled inhabitants of the low countries, or

their encounters with the piratical Gothic hordes of Norway and 
Denmark, who occupied the greater portion of the Hebrides and 
the Orkney and Shetland Isles, with the northern parts of the 
main coasts of Scotland. Hence but little light could now be 
cast, even did the present work admit of such a disquisition, on 
the ancient state of this or of any of the adjoining parishes, were 
it not that the existence, at a very early period, of the Royal 
burgh of Inverness, ever since regarded as the capital of the High- 
lands, attracts the eye to the fortunes of its inhabitants and through 
their transactions a faint picture may be drawn, not only of their own 
condition, but of that also of the surrounding districts. 

Burgh of Inverness. — From the researches of the antiquarian 
writers, mentioned in the subjoined note, it has been shewn that 
Inverness, if not existing in the time of the Roman invasions of 
Britain, was soon thereafter the seat of the Pictish monarchy, and 
was of some importance during the sixth century, when it was vi- 
sited by St Columba, the first great Christian missionary to the 
Highlands. Its local advantages early marked it out as a fit site 
for one of those large strongholds, by means of which the nobles and 
sovereigns were enabled to retain their sway over extensive dis- 
tricts, and hence we find that Macbeth, the Celtic maormor, or 
great Lord of Ross and Moray, had a castle here, which was pro- 
bably visited by the " good King Duncan," on account, as Shak- 
speare says, " of its pleasant seat ; the air nimbly and sweetly re- 
commending itself unto his gentle senses," but which, on the cruel 
murder of that monarch, was razed to the ground by his son, Mal- 
colm III. or Ceanmore, who erected a new fortress on a rising

bank, a little to the westward of the former, and which continued 
ever after to be held by some of the more powerful chieftains of 
the neighbourhood for the king, as a royal house or garrison, down 
to the year 1746, when it was blown up by the troops of Prince 
Charles Edward Stuart. 

It was under the protection of this second castle the eastern 
outer screen or rampart of which is still partly standing that the 
houses of the burgh were gradually congregated, consisting, with 
the exception of a few larger buildings belonging to the neigh- 
bouring gentry, even at no very remote period, for the most part, 
of cottages thatched with heather and straw, and which, being oc- 
cupied by a colony of foreign traders, chiefly Flemish, were con- 
stantly exposed to depredations and frequent burnings, by the 
marauding clans of the west coast, as well as to the severe exac- 
tions of the governors of their own castle. It was, however, the 
wise and uniform policy of the sovereigns to encourage the growth 
of such mercantile communities, as well for the general prosperity 
of the country in regard to commerce, as for a check on the exor- 
bitant power of the nobles, and as abounding in loyal subjects fa- 
vourable to personal liberty, industry, and peace. Hence, besides 
being frequently favoured with the presence of royalty, whether for 
the purposes of amusement, dispensing justice, or overawing and 
suppressing the rebellions of the northern chiefs, Inverness was 
early endowed with many privileges and immunities. It was erect- 
ed into a royal burgh by David L, and was styled by him one of 
the " loca capitalia per totum regnum." William the Lion grant- 
ed four charters to it, which were confirmed by succeeding mo- 
narchs ; and James III. conferred a new grant on it, which recites 
at length eight previous charters. The great charter of the town, 
however, was conferred by James VI. in the year 1591. These 
curious documents are still entire and legible, and are kept among 
the town's archives. 

Exclusive of the recent improvements in the town and parish, 
to be afterwards slightly noticed, no event of very great importance 
to either has occurred since the battle of CuUodenonthe 16th April 
1746; but, prior to that date, the whole neighbourhood was fre- 
quently disturbed by bloody clan conflicts and sackings of the town, 
the particulars of which will be found detailed in the works above 
referred to, and which are now worthy of remembrance only as 
indicative of the present happier condition of the people under the 
regular and impartial administration of equal laws.

Heritors. — The parish contains about seven or eight principal 
heritors, whose estates in it yielfl each from L. 1000 to L. 2000 a 
year, while there are about 25 proprietors with smaller rentals. 

Registers. — The records offthe proceedings of the kirk-session 
extend back to August 1602, between which year and 1655 they 
were irregularly kept ; and gfterwards down to 1673 no minutes 
have been preserved. Sinc'e then, they are pretty regular, and 
registers of marriages and baptisms are kept separately, and lat- 
terly with great care and accuracy. 

Antiquities. — Our limits prevent us from doing little more than 
barely enumerating the objects of antiquity in this parish, and this 
is the less to be regretted, as they are fully described in the more 
recent works to which we have already referred. Commencing on 
the west side of the parish are seen, \st, the rocky eminences 
above the village of Clachnaharry signifying the watchman's stone, 
and on which in ancient times the magistrates of Inverness had a 
guard stationed to give notice of any hostile approach from Ross- 
shire or Strathglass. This spot is further marked by a large 
column erected by the late H. R. DufF, Esq. of Muirtown, com- 
memorative of a desperate battle fought here a. d. 1333, be- 
tween the Clanchattan and the Munroes of Fowlis. 2c, The 
summit of the hill near the base of which these rocks occur, is 
crowned with the celebrated vitrified fortress of Craiff Phadric, 
which is double walled, the ramparts exhibiting heaps of boulder 
stones strongly cemented together to the depth of three or four 
feet by fire, and which commands within sight of it a chain of si- 
milarly vitrified structures, about ten in number, extending in every 
direction into the central districts of the county, and by means of 
which signals by beacon fires were in ancient times carried across 
the island to the opposite coast.  Qd, Below it is the detached hill, 
already alluded to, called Tomnahurich, or the Watchman's Hill, 
some of the fields adjoining being called BaUiefearie, or the Watch- 
man's Town, and which, besides being thus a " ward hill," was also 
celebrated in the olden time, according to local belief, as the fa- 
vourite and chief resort in the north of the tiny race of fairies, and 
was further used by grosser mortals as a great moat, or gathering 
hdl, on various occasions of public importance. The magistrates 
of Inverness used also in ancient times to patronise horse-races run 
round its base. 4A, Close by, and a little to the west of, this cu-

feet. Its barometrical elevation above the sea is only 433 feet.

rious mount, is a high gravelly ridge called Tor-a'-Bhean, from its 
containing the cairn or sepulchre, according to some, of an early 
monk called Bean or Benjamin, but more likely of Donald Bane, 
an Hebridean chief, and leader of a body of islesmen, who, in 1 187, 
encountered a party from the Castle of Inverness, headed by Dun- 
can Mackintosh, son of the governor, who, as well as his principal 
opponent, is said to have perished in the conflict. Part of this 
ridge is encircled with ditches and ramparts, as if it formed an 
ancient hill-fort, and at its base, along which the Caledonian Canal 
has been carried, a massive silver chain was discovered in the year 
1808, consisting of thirty-three circular double links, neatly chan- 
nelled round with a prominent astragal, and terminating at either 
end in two rings larger than the others, which were about two in- 
ches in diameter, the whole weighing 104 ounces, and extending 
to eighteen inches in length. This relic, now, we believe, in the 
possession of the Antiquarian Society in Edinburgh, was probably 
an ornament or ensign of office of the island chieftain. The 
estate of Bught, of which Tor-a'-Bhean is a part, is called in Gaelic 
Kil a Bhean or Bean's burying-ground. bth, On the margin of 
Loch Dochfour, four miles further on, are seen the ruins of the old 
church of the parish of Bona, now united to that of Inverness, and 
on an adjoining peninsula between this lake and Loch- Ness there is 
an oblong square, rounded at the corners, and encircled with an ir- 
regular ditch, which is believed to have been a Roman encamp- 
ment, pitched, according to Mr Chalmers, Caledonia, I. 63, on 
the site of the British Boness, or foot of Loch- Ness, a name Latin- 
ized by the Romans into Bonessia, and by Ptolemy into Banatia. 
On the eastern Ager are the remains of a small baronial keep, styled 
" Castle Spiritin" which completely commanded the adjoining fords 
across the River Ness, and to which, most probably, belonged the 
walled structure or look-out-place, on the summit of the adjoining- 
granitic ridge of the Craigderg or the red rocks. Qth, At the com- 
mencement of the ascent from Loch-Ness to the upland district of 
Aberiachan, still further westward, are the remains of an ancient 
kil, or burying-ground, on which probably the church of Bona ori- 
ginally stood ; and on the moss of Caiplich, which occupies a flat 
or piece of table-land, nearly ten miles long, at the top of the dis- 
trict just mentioned, are many sepulchral cairns, marking the sites 
of early clan conflicts. 1th, Returning to the eastern boundary of 
the parish, the most important locality is the well known and oft- 
described field of the battle of Culloden, and one mile beyond it,

within the confines of the parish of Croy, the most singular and ex- 
tensive series of stone circles and cairns in the north, situate on the 
plain of Clava, on the southern bank of the river Nairn. 8th, On 
the ridge of the Leys, also within the parish of Croy, two and a- 
half miles south of Inverness, is a large and very entire series of 
concentric circles, forming a beautiful Druidical temple ; and 
many similar structures, now partly destroyed, exist in the pa- 
rish of Inverness, as, for instance, on the plain of Culloden and at 
Stoneyfield, a farm so called from having two of them on its sur- 
face. 9th, The estates of Culloden, Castlehill, Inches, Castle 
Leathers, and Dunain, were each anciently provided with its own 
keep or tower, besides the castle of Inverness already mentioned, 
which, for size and general importance, took precedence of them 
all. lOth, Oliver Cromwell in 1652-7, erected a citadel and 
fort on the north side of the town of Inverness, near the mouth of 
the river. It cost L. 80,000 Sterling, was of a pentagonal form, 
surrounded by ramparts and a ditch still existing, the latter ca- 
pable at full tide of floating a small bark. It could accommodate 
1000 men, but the garrison, though strongly fitted up, was aban- 
doned and destroyed soon after the restoration of Charles IL to 
propitiate the Highland chiefs, who were jealous of its existence so 
near their own domains. Uth, Almost all the ecclesiastical build- 
ings in Inverness existing in the time of Cromwell, as well as the 
Priory of Beauly, the Abbey of Kinloss, and the Bishop's Castle 
and Cathedral at Fortrose, were thrown down by the Protector's 
orders, and the stones of them employed in the erection of his 
citadel. Hence no remains of old religious houses are to be seen 
in Inverness, although it is known the Dominicans or Black Friars 
had an establishment here as far back as the reign of Alexander 
II., and tradition says the Franciscans or Gray Friars had also a 
convent in Inverness. The large burying-ground called the chapel 
yard belonged to the monastery of the former, and, before the pre- 
sent entrance to it was made, it had a neat arched gateway crowned 
with ornaments, and bearing this inscription, " concordia parvae 
res crescunt." im, Near the conflux of the River Ness with 
the sea, there is a large cairn of stones of great antiquity, and now 
marked by a post pointing out to vessels the mouth of the former. 
It is called Cairn Arc, and is only of importance in connection 
with cairns similarly situated in the Beauly Frith, as indicative of 
the apparent encroachment of the sea on the coast since these 
erections were made. Besides a uniform tradition, facts are not

wanting to prove a general rise of the salt waters along the whole 
coasts of the Moray Frith, during at least the last two centuries. 

Modern Buildings. — The principal proprietors in the parish 
have mansion houses on their properties, some of which are hand- 
some, and all genteel and commodious; the largest and most elegant 
of which are Culloden House, Darochville, now fhe seat of the Right 
Honourable Lady Saltoun, Muirtown House, Raigmore House, and 
the beautifully situated mansion of Dochfour. On the summit of 
the Castlehill of Inverness a suit of county buildings for court rooms 
and public offices are now in course of being erected after a de- 
sign by Mr Burn of Edinburgh, in imitation of some of the large 
English castles, and when finished, from their commanding situa- 
tion, elegance of workmanship, and the variety and beauty of the 
different compartments, they will be surpassed by few public build- 
ings in the kingdom. It is computed that they will cost about 
L. 7000, to be defrayed by an assessment on the county, and space 
has been left adjoining them for the addition of a new jail in a 
similar style of architecture, for the criminals of the northern coun- 
ties, so soon as funds can be collected, and the conditions- of its 
erection decided upon. On the height immediately to the south 
of the Castlehill, a neat edifice has been also recently erected for the 
United Charity Institutions of Inverness, consisting of an infant 
school on Mr Wilderspin's plan, a female school, a female work 
society, and an association for the distribution of clothes and blan- 
kets to the poor; and as the site occupies the highest point in the 
neighbourhood of the town, the building is about to be surmounted 
with a small octagonal tower and dome, to be fitted up as an observa- 
tory, and for which funds have been provided by subscription. In the 
year 1804, an Infirmary for the use of the northern counties was 
finished, which stands in a healthy and delightful situation, on the 
west bank of the River Ness, and is the only public building in the 
parish out of the town. Its history and usefulness are glanced at 
afterwards. The principal buildings within the burgh are the two 
parish churches, the Episcopal and other chapels, of whicbrhere 
are five, all neat and plain edifices ; the Town Hall, erected in 3, 
having in front of it the Exchange, with the ancient Town Ci : 
and Clach-na-cudden, or " Stone of the Tubs," the palladium of 
the burgh, and on which the predecessors of the present race of 
maid-servants were wont in ancient days to rest their water-pails 
in passing to and from the river;— the Jail, built in 1791, to which 
is attached a remarkably handsome spire 150 feet high ;-the Aca-

demy for the education of youth, endowed by Royal charter in 
1793; — Raining's charity school ; — the old grammar school or hos- 
pital, a bequest to the community in 1668 by Provost Alexander 
Dunbar, which is now used as a library, lady's school, and for several 
other public purposes. Near the top of Church Street is a high plain 
building, erected by subscription, and called the Northern Meeting 
Rooms, which contains an elegant ball-room and dining-room. The 
area of Cromwell's citadel is now occupied by a large hemp manu- 
factory, which has existed there since the year 1 765. There is also 
a woollen one in the town, and the parish contains three breweries 
and one distillery, with several water-mills, and one wind-mill, all 
of which are built of stone and lime. Neat villas, with gardens 
attached to them, are yearly increasing about the town. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the town and parish in the year 1791 was 7930 

1801, 8732 
1811, ] 0,7.50 
1821, 12,264 
1831, 14,324 

In the last census, 9663 belonged to the town ; and of the whole 
population about 529 families are chiefly employed in agriculture; 
1015 families in trade; and 1 766 are not included in either of these 
classes. The number of inhabited houses in the town and parish 
is about 2130. With the burghs of Forres, Nairn, and Fortrose, 
Inverness returns one Member to Parliament ; and its registered 
constituency the first season after the passing of the Reform Act 
amounted to 466; in 1834 it amounted to 489,— the constituency' 
within the old royalty, entitled to vote for the election of burgh 
councillors, being at the last election 408. 

The gradual increase of population shown above exceeds a little 
the general ratio of increase throughout the kingdom, in conse- 
quence of Inverness having been resorted to by a great number of 
labourers durmg the formation of the Caledonian Canal, and now 
 the poor tenants and cottagers removing to it from the country. 
I he ■ erage number of baptisms for the last ten years is 360 • of 
deaP about 300 though in 1832 and 1834, the ravages of cho- 
IffT-mo doubt mcreased that ratio, and the marriages amount to 
about 106 a year. 

None of the nobility, except Lady Saltoun, reside in this parish ; 
but, m consequence of the increase of building in and about Inver- 
ness, the cheapness of living, and some of the country residences 
benig occasionally to let, a considerable resort of strangers, gene-

nerally of medium incomes, has taken place to this district of late 
years. 

We have been unable to procure data for ascertaining the pro- 
portions of bachelors, widowers, and unmarried females, in this 
densely peopled parish. Among the labouring classes marriage is 
almost a matter of pecuniary convenience ; for a man in narrow cn- 
cumstances finds it more economical to marry than to keep a ser- 
vant, and, if a widower with daughters, it is seldom the case that 
they choose to live long with him, as they are better fed and cloth- 
ed by going into service, or marrying for themselves, so that second 
and even third marriages by the same individual are not imcom- 
raon. The average number of children in each family is about 
4, and, from the emigration of males abroad in quest of occupa- 
tions, and their fondness for a mihtary life, there is, and it is 
thought there always has been, a considerable excess of females 
resident in this parish. Indeed, from Dr Cleland's population re- 
ports for Scotland, it would appear that when the census of 1821 
was taken, the proportion of females above males was higher in In- 
verness than in any other town in the country, excepting Greenock. 
At that time there were in Inverness, 7001 females, and 5263 males, 
and if we suppose that, under the age of twenty, the sexes were equal, 
which the county returns prove them on the whole to have been, 
there would be then in the burgh under twenty years of age, 3500 fe- 
males, and 3500 males; leaving above twenty years of age, 3500 fe- 
males, and 1763 males. Now, if one-third of the males above twenty 
be held as unmarried, which is a rather large proportion, and two- 
thirds to be married, that is 588 of the former class, and 1175 
males of the latter, their will remain 2325 females above the age 
of twenty unmarried, to 588 males above that age unmarried,— a 
proportion nearly of 4 to 1  A similar result will be found appli- 
cable both to Greenock and Inverness, if the previous returns for 
1801 and 1811 be similarly scrutinized. 

Language, Customs, 'c— In the remoter parts of the parish, and 
by some of the poorer classes in town, the Gaelic language is exclu- 
sively spoken, but it is fast wearing out, and by the rising generation 
English is almost universally preferred, especially in the town of In- 
verness, where many of them are wholly ignorant of Gaelic. There 
is nothing remarkable in the features or bodily strength or exercises 
of the inhabitants; and, although the games of foot-ball, shmtie, 
throwing the stone, hammer, and bowls, were formerly common 
among the lower orders, no amusements of the sort are now prac-

tised, except among boys and apprentices on Christmas and New- 
year's day, — the sober reahties and industrious habits of the present 
age having seemingly banished from the thoughts of the peasantry 
the pastimes of their forefathers. 

Pauperism has undoubtedly increased in the town of Inverness 
of late years ; and a recent survey, occasioned by the distress 
arising from cholera, demonstrated that there are about 800 per- 
sons many of them having families in Inverness in extremely in- 
digent circumstances. 

The habits of the lower orders in regard to cleanliness and in- 
dustry are daily improving, as are also the comforts of their cot- 
tages and household furnishings. On Sundays they all appear 
well dressed ; in town, more tastefully, and, but for the present 
cheapness of manufactures, in some instances it might be thought 
rather expensively. The upper classes enjoy all the comforts and 
elegancies of hfe as fully as their equals in any part of the king- 
dom to whose manners their own are now assimilated,— the purity 
and correctness of their language, in particular, having been re- 
marked since the residence of Cromwell's troops in Inverness, as 
superior, and but little affected by the common broad dialect of 
Scotland. 

Labourers and farm-servants generally live on potatoes with 
milk, oat and barley-meal prepared in various ways,— to which the 
wealthier tradesmen are enabled to add fish and butcher-meat. 
The general rate of ploughmen and farm-servants' wages is L. 8 
in money, and 6 bolls of meal, with liberty to plant as much ground 
with potatoes as they can manure; and, in common, female field 
work IS reckoned about two-thirds of the value of a man's labour 
Superior servants or grieves have higher wages, and perhaps grass 
and foddering for a cow, according to the extent of the farms under 
their charge. All classes are increasing in knowledge and intelli- 
gence; and, while the upper are well educated, the inferior orders 
are pressing rapidly on them in all kinds of intellectual attainment; 
and although the increase of population in the town has here, as 
elsewhere, been accompanied with a corresponding increase of vice, 
yet the moral character of the parishioners generally, as compared 
with that of other places, is high,-their attendance on church 
being exemplary and regular. 

There are generally about six illegitimate births in the parish 
yearly,

IV. — Industry, 
Agriculture. — In the western and higher parts of the parish, in 
the districts of Aberiachan and Caiplich, and the heights of Doch- 
four and Dunain, cuhivation has been sparingly and in patches 
carried up to an elevation of perhaps 800 feet above the sea. In 
the vale of the Ness, the large and regularly fenced fields are little 
elevated above the bed of the river ; and behind them, on the 
southern side, the terraced bank already noticed rises to the 
height of 90 feet, and stretches back to the base of the sandstone 
ridge of the Leys, with a flat or gently undulating surface, from 
one to one and a-half or two miles in breadth. The subsoil is 
universally a porous gravel, the superior soil being generally sharp 
or sandy ; and hence, from the absence in many parts of the pa- 
rish of a due proportion of clay, the cultivated land, though warm 
and early, can scarcely be denominated rich, or favourable to the 
growth of large forest trees requiring deep loams. 

The number of acres under cultivation is supposed to be from 
8000 to 9000; waste perhaps 3000; improvable about 1000, there 
being scarcely any undivided ground ; while the rest of the sur- 
faced under heath, or beautifully and usefully covered with 
woods of Scotch fir, and thriving plantations of larch, ash, elm, 
beech, and oak. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of cultivated ground is from 
L. 1 to L, 2, 10s. per acre, except in the close vicinity of the 
town, where it fetches from L. 5 to L. 7 an acre. There is Httle 
or no ground set for grazing. 

Rate of Wages, -c— The rate of wages is from Is. to 2s. a- 
day to labourers, and from Is. 6d. to 2s. and 3s. for artisans. 
The prices of implements of husbandry and houhold furniture 
vary much, according to the kinds and qualities ; but generally, a 
o-ood cart costs from L. 8 to L. 9 ; a wooden plough L. 2 ; but the 
plough most in use is formed of malleable iron-work, and costs 
from L. 4 to L. 5. The chairs and tables used by labourers are 
of common fir deals, and very plain, the former costing from 2s. to 
6s. or 8s. ; but there is a regular gradation upwards tdl we find ar- 
ticles as finished and fashionable as are made in Edmburgh or Lon- 
don The price of a rood of mason work is L. 1, 16s. ; and when 
scatTolding is required L. 2 or L. 2, 2s., or L. 8, includmg mate- 
rials per rood of ruble work; and of carpenter work for roofing 
and sarking, 6d. to 8d. per yard; flooring and joistmg, lOd. to Is. 
per yard ; pannelling, 6d. to 8d. per foot, and so on as to the other

parts of a building. About 100 families are supported by sawing 
timber. 

Price of Provisions, §"c. — Good beef sells in Inverness at from4d. 
to 5d. per imperial lb. ; mutton, from 3d. to 5d. ; veal, 2d. to 5d. ; 
pork, of which no great quantity is exposed, on account of the de- 
mand for cured pork for export and shipping, 3|d. to 4d. There 
is an abundant supply of excellent haddocks, which sell at from 
three to six for 6d. ; cod, from Id. to Is. a piece, according to the 
size and quantity ; superior skate, 3d. to Is. each ; herrings vary 
much in price, as boats only occasionally leave the fishery ground 
to dispose of this fish so far up the frith, — they sell at from ten to 
fifty for 6d.; salmon are as high as Is. to Is. 6d. per lb., — the salmon 
fishers being under an engagement to send almost all that may be 
caught to the London market; grilse sell for 6d. Fowls, Is. 6d. 
to 2s. a pair; chickens half-price; ducks Is. 4d. to 2s. a-pair; 
geese and turkeys from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. each. Potatoes gene- 
rally 2s. per cwt. Shop goods sell pretty much as in other pro- 
vincial towns. House rents for the better classes are moderate, 
averaging from L. 15 to L.50, and shops the same. The wages of 
house-maids are L. 1, 10s. to L. 3 per half year — average L. 2. 
There are generally several country houses to let in the neigh- 
bourhood of Inverness at from L. 30 to L. 200 a-year, furnished 
and unfurnished, and with garden ground, office-houses, and grass 
parks, and other accommodations. 

Live-Stock. — The breed of cattle common in this parish is 
a mixed one of the old Highland, Morayshire, and Ayrshire 
kinds, and considerable attention is paid to their improvement, 
both for the dairy and butcher. A five years' rotation of crop- 
ping is generally observed, and the system of husbandry followed 
is of the most improved description. Within the last twenty 
years a great extent of waste land has been drained and reclaimed, 
and much ground planted ; but none of any consequence has been 
irrigated or embanked. 

Husbandry. — The general duration of leases is for nineteen years, 
though some do not exceed fourteen, or even seven years ; and now, 
instead of allowing meliorations for improvements in buildings, 
proprietors are beginning to erect office -houses themselves on 
their farms, charging the tenants with a yearly per centage on the 
outlay. Most of the heritors farm portions of their own estates, 
which are provided with excellent accommodations, — superior, of- 
course, to the more plain but substantial squares of offices posses-

INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



sed by the tenants. The fields are generally enclosed either with 
stone and mortar walls, or stone dikes without cement, or with 
hedges and rows of forest trees. 

Quarries. — Fresh water shell marl is found and dug out for 
manure in several parts of the district, especially on the estate of 
Essich ; and that of Nesscastle, in the parish of Dores, adjoining 
the other, abounds in this substance ; but there are no mines in 
the parish, and but a small number of quarries wrought, the red 
and gray sandstones of this neighbourhood being much inferior in 
compactness, hardness, and beauty to those brought by sea from 
Munlochy and Redcastle in Ross-shire, and to the white and yel- 
low freestone of Covesea, in the shire of Elgin. 

Fishings. — Salmon is the only fish caught within the bounds of 
the parish, the sea shore being unproductive, except occasionally 
that a few small herrings and cuddies, or coal-fish, are got. For- 
merly the salmon fisheries in the Ness were extremely productive, 
and in ancient times their fish were known as luxuries in many ci- 
ties of the continent. Persons are still alive who recollect having 
seen eighty salmon taken at one cast of the net ; but, owing to 
causes not well understood, the value of the fishery has greatly 
decreased within the last thirty or forty years, so that what then 
fetched a yearly rent of L. 1100 is now let for L. 370; and, we 
understand, the tacksmen are calling for a further reduction of the 
sums conditioned to be paid by them. 

Produce. — In the absence of authentic data, we have consulted 
agriculturalists, who regard the rental of the parish as about 
L. 20,000, and the whole yearly produce ought hence to be some- 
where about equal to L. 60,000, Taking the rotation to be five 
years, consisting of two white crops, one green, and two hay crops, 
the result will be that two-fifths of the produce are corn, and the 
remainder green or soft ; and, supposing both of nearly equal value, 
we have about L. 24,000 worth of corn, and L. 36,000 of green 
crops. The annual produce of gardens and of the thinnings of 
plantations is inconsiderable. 

Manufactures. — Formerly a good deal of linen yarn and worsted 
thread was spun for the supply of home consumpt in this parish, 
but this is almost wholly superseded by the produce of the great 
manufacturing establishments of the south. Two hemp manufac- 
tories, for the making principally of coal and cotton bagging, ex- 
isted for a considerable time in Inverness, one of which was dis- 
continued some years ago. The subsisting establishment, occu- 



INVERNESS. 



23 



pying the area of Cromwell's fortress, employs about 110 men, 
150 women, and 20 boys and girls, who work from ten to twelve 
hours a day, and earn, the men, from 4s. to 10s. ; the women, from 
2s. to 3s. 6d. and the children from Is. 6d. to 2s. a-week. For- 
merly, nearly double the number of persons just stated were em- 
ployed. These work people are in general healthy; some of them 
have been long lived, and, in point of morals, they are not in the 
least inferior to the rest of the population in the town and parish. 

The hemp employed in this factory is imported from the Bal- 
tic, and is manufactured into cloth for bags, sacking, and tarpau- 
hn, chiefly for the London market, and the East and West Indies. 

In the woollen manufactory, for the weaving of coarse clothing 
and Highland plaids and tartan, there are employed from 20 to 
25 persons, of different ages, from ten years and upwards, who 
earn from 3s. to 15s. a-week. The proprietor of it has also a 
carding-mill for the preparation and spinning of wool ; and there 
are also in the town and parish three tan-works, supporting a small 
number of artisans. 

Navigation and Commerce. — Inverness in ancient times posses- 
sed a large share of the scanty commerce of Scotland. Boethius, • 
who wrote full 300 years ago, states, that in ages long before " a 
concourse of German merchants annually resorted to the town for 
the purposes of trade," bringing with them the manufactures of 
their own nation, and taking away in return quantities of skins and 
other products of the Highlands ; but that, owing to the frequent 
burnings and plunderings to which the town had been subjected, 
its prosperity had been greatly impaired. Buchanan confirms this 
statement, and it would appear that, even for some years subse- 
quent to the final union of Scotland with England, the merchants 
of Inverness carried on their import trade with the ports of France 
and Holland, transferring it to that of London, only as convenience 
and the cheapness of British manufactures drew their attention to 
that great mart of commerce. Wine and ale were formerly more 
abundantly used in the Highlands than spirituous liquors ; and, 
until the general introduction of tea, the trade in malting was a 
considerable one in Inverness, as in most of the northern burghs. 
Some of the old and large malt kilns and granaries used for it are 
still in existence. Weavers and glovers formed two of the incor- 
porated trades in the old set of the burgh, and these were for- 
merly numerous and rather influential bodies. 

In regard to trade, Inverness is now the centre of the Custom- 



24 



V INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



house district, which extends from the mouth of the Spey to the 
Dornoch Frith on the east coast, and from Assynt Point to Ard- 
namurchan on the west. The tonnage of all the shipping belong- 
ing to the district is about 7200 tons, and the number of vessels 
150: the port of Inverness possessing about one-half of the ves- 
sels and nearly two-thirds of the tonnage. The west coasts of 
Ross-shire and Inverness-shire, with the Isle of Skye, possess 
about 1000 additional tons of shipping, and about 36 vessels. In- 
verness has six vessels, of about 130 tons burthen, regularly trad- 
ing with London, of which one sails from and to London every 
eighth day : with Leith it has three traders, and with Aberdeen 
two. Ship-building has recently been commenced here by one or 
two enterprising individuals with great spirit. A striking altera- 
tion has of late taken place in the trade in grain : within fifteen 
years, about 8000 to 10,000 bolls of oatmeal used to be imported 
to Inverness ; while now, from 4000 to 5000 bolls of oats are ex- 
ported from its piers. From Easter Ross and the vicinity of In- 
verness and Beauly, from 30,000 to 40,000 quarters of wheat are 
annually shipped, and l&amp;rge quantities of grain are exported from 
Caithness. About 100 cargoes of mixed goods are delivered in 
the course of the year at the ports of the Moray Frith, lying be- 
tween Speymouth and the Dornoch Frith, from London, Leith, 
and Aberdeen. These supply the greater part of the counties to 
which the ports belong. The total coasting imports in this dis- 
trict are supposed to be about 60,000, and foreign imports about 
1000 tons, and the coasting exports to be about 70,000 tons, con- 
sisting of wood, wool, grain, and hemp cloth. The foreign an- 
nual imports into Inverness consist of from 400 to 600 tons of 
hemp, and three or four cargoes of timber and Archangel tar. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion. — Inverness is the only market- town in the parish, 
and since the date of the last report, it has increased considerably 
in the style and number of its buildings, as well as of its popula- 
tion. Besides a more efficient system of police, and due attention 
to cleanliness,— during the year 1831, a great inprovement in the 
paving of the streets was commenced. The whole have been 
causewayed anew with granite and hard sandstone, or quartz rock, 
from the banks of Loch Ness, and the side pavements laid with 
Caithness flag, while common sewers have been constructed under- 
neath the streets. These highly useful measures were effected by 
means of an assessment of 6d. per pound on rents,— the total ex- 



INVERNESS. 25 

pense exceeding L. 6000. The town is exceedingly well lighted 
with coal gas, and supplied with water in pipes from the river. 
The original cost of the gas works, which are very complete, in- 
cluding the expense of forming the company, and procuring an act 
of Parliament, was L. 8757 ; that of the water-wheel for raising the 
water from the river, and pipes, L. 4872. Certain parts of the pro- 
fits have been laid aside to pay the interest of borrowed money, 
and to form a contingent fund in case of unforeseen demands ; but 
since the year 1828 the company has paid dividends to the share- 
holders, which have gradually increased from 1 to 4| per cent. 
Subscriptions for the formation of this company were commenced 
in 1825. 

Villages. — The only villages in the parish are those of Clach- 
naherry, at the " Watchman's Stone," above-mentioned, about a 
mile to the west of the town, containing about 300 inhabitants, 
chiefly fishers and boat-builders,— and Culcabock village, one mile 
to the south-east of Invei-ness, which is occupied by about 100 la- 
bourers and masons. 

Coaches and Public Conveyances — Besides a four-horse daily 
mail-coach to Aberdeen on the one hand, and to Dingwall, Tain, 
and Thurso on the other, two daily coaches proceed from Inver- 
ness on the coast road to Elgin and Aberdeen ; one twice a-week, 
and in certain seasons daily, to Perth by the great Highland road, 
and Diligences occasionally ply in summer between Inverness, 
Strathpeff'er, and Cromarty, through the adjoining district of Ross- 
shire, called the Black Isle ; and to these means of conveyance 
are to be added the steam and sailing vessels above described, and 
carriers by land in almost every direction. 

Caledonian Canal.~\x this part of the statistics of the parish, 
it would be improper to omit a short sketch of the history and di- 
mensions of the Caledonian Canal, which passes through the centre 
of the parish and Great Glen of Scotland, and the beneficial effects 
of which on the general commerce of the country, and the local 
improvement of this district, have scarcely as yet fully developed 
themselves. 

The subject of the Caledonian Canal, and connected with it va- 
rious other extensive improvements in the Highlands of Scotland, 
havmg been brought under the attention of Government, a prepa- 
ratory survey and report of the whole was made by the late Mr 
Telford, by command of the Lords Commissioners of the Trea- 
sury, m the autumn of 1802, and in September of the following 



26 



INVEIINESS-SHIRE. 



year, the cutting of the canal was partially commenced; but it was 
not until the year 1805 that the works were put in full operation. 
The north-eastern portion of the canal, as far as Fort- Augustus, 
was opened for navigation in the summer of 1818, a regular pas- 
sage between Inverness and Fort- Augustus was established by 
means of steam-boats in 1820, and on the 23d and 24th October 
1 822, the first voyage was made from sea to sea. Since this period 
it has been regularly navigated, with scarcely any interruption, al- 
though not completed to the full extent of the original design, 
which contemplated a depth of 20 feet water. The depth at pre- 
sent afforded is 15 feet,— a further deepening of the summit level 
being the principal work required to attain the former depth, as 
almost the whole of the buildings and banks are constructed of the 
full dimensions to receive it. The total expense of construction has 
been about one million of pounds Sterhng, to which is to be added 
the expense of maintenance, since the opening of the navigation. 
The latter has hitherto exceeded the produce of the tonnage rates, 
which are extremely moderate. 

The canal extends about eight miles from the tide lock at 
Clachnaharry, to the north-east end of Loch Ness, being all in the 
parish of Inverness. It ascends in this distance a height of about 
46 feet. The whole length of the canal from sea to sea is 
62 miles, of which 40 miles pass through natural lakes Loch 
Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy, and there are 22 miles 
of cutting. From the singularly uniform direction of these 
lakes, and of the valley which they partially cover, the whole 
length of the canal when extended on a map, measures only four 
miles longer than a straight line drawn from one extremity to the 
other. There are twenty-eight locks on the hne, fourteen ascend- 
ing to, and fourteen descending from, the summit level in Loch 
Oich, which is about 95 feet above ordinary high water at Inver- 
ness. The dimensions of the locks are 170 feet in length by 40 
feet in width ; and the whole of the other works are on a scale of 
proportional magnitude. The present rate of tonnage duty levied on 
sailing-vessels or steam-boats, laden or unladen, passing along the 
canal in either direction, is one farthing per ton per mile, there be- 
ing no dues chargeable upon goods of any description. The pro- 
duce of these extremely low rates has averaged form L. 2000 to 
L. 3000 per annum ; and the aggregate tonnage passing through, 
inclusive of the steam-boats, may be rated at about 30,000 tons. 
Immediately on the opening of the canal, a regular communica- 



INVERNESS. 



27 



tion was established, and has since been maintained between In- 
verness, Glasgow, and the west coast, generally by means of steam- 
boats, and with all parts of the United Kingdom, for the ordinary 
carrying trade by means of sailing-vessels, which import all the pro- 
ducts of the south to the Highlands, and carry away timber, wool, 
grain, and the produce of the northern fisheries. 

For all these purposes the Canal presents important facilities, 
and would no doubt be much more frequented than it is, were 
steam tug boats established to insure at all times a speedy passage 
through the lakes, — the delay and uncertainty at present from 
adverse winds being sometimes considerable. The communication 
between Inverness and Liverpool through this canal, and directly 
with London by the German Ocean, is now about to be completed 
by steamers of a large size; while with Aberdeen and Leith it has been 
open by steam for several years back. A company, indeed, has 
been formed, who intend, in courseof next summer 1835, to run 
a steam ship of 240 horse power between Inverness and London, 
touching at all the ports of the Moray Frith; and a powerful ves- 
sel already plies to Liverpool. The chief effect of the canal, so 
far as regards the town of Inverness, has hitherto been the com- 
mencement and gradual formation of a direct intercourse with the 
great western marts of Glasgow and Liverpool, and through them 
with the manufacturing districts with which these cities are so close- 
ly connected. 

Roads. — The principal roads which radiate from Inverness and 
intersect the parish in different directions, are under the manage- 
ment of the Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland roads and 
bridges,— a body appointed for opening up the communication by 
land, much about the same time that, under similar management, 
the Caledonian Canal was projected. They form portions, \st, 
of the great south road by Fort- George to Elgin and Aberdeen ; 
2fZ, of the Highland road through Badenoch and across the sum- 
mit of the country to Perth ; M, of the Old Military road along 
the south side of Loch Ness to Fort- Augustus and Fort- William ; 
th, of the road along the north side of Loch Ness by Urquhart to 
Glenmoriston, Glenshiel, and Skye; bth, of the great north road 
by Beauly to Dingwall and Tain, and Qth, the short piece of road 
to Kessock Ferry, which connects Inverness with the neighbour- 
Jng parts of Ross-shire. The whole of these lines were either 
Military roads, improved and widened under the direction of the 
Commissioners, or originally constructed by them, with the aid of 



28 



INVEUNKSS-SiilRE. 



contributions from the county proprietors ; and they are maintain- 
ed under a system of the most efficient repair by the same means 
which effected their formation. The expense is defrayed in about 
equal proportions by Government aid and county assessment, the 
hitter being of late years considerably relieved by the produce of 
tolls, which have been established on several of the roads. The 
other roads contained in the parish, which are of subordinate im- 
portance, are under the management of the district proprietors, as 
trustees, and are maintained by general assessment originally im- 
posed by virtue of certain local statutes, which were consolidated in 
a new act of Parliament passed 29th May 1830. The expense of re- 
pairs on the parliamentary roads in the neighbourhood of Inverness, 
where the traffic is considerable, averages from L. 10 to L. 15 per 
mile. 

Bridges. — There are two bridges across the River Ness. One 
of stone with seven ribbed arches, erected in 1685 by contribu- 
tions throughout the kingdom, at a cost of L. 1300 ; and one of 
wood, finished in 1808, from public and private subscriptions, and 
which cost L. 4000. A pontage is levied at both bridges from 
strangers. Two small but beautifully wooded islands in the Ness, 
a mile above the town, are now in course of being connected with 
the opposite banks by airy chain suspension bridges, the interior 
being laid out in walks ; and when this improvement is completed, 
one of the bridges has been in existence for many years, and 
funds have been recently collected for the other, Inverness can 
boast of a set of public promenades almost unequalled for extent, 
variety, and beauty of scenery, by those of any town in the kingdom. 

Harbours. — Three harbours have been erected near the mouth 
of the river at different times, the lowest of which admits vessels of 
250 tons burthen; while large ships have exellent anchorage ground 
in Kessock Roads, or can receive and deliver goods at the Caledo- 
nian Canal wharfs within a mile of the town. 

Churches and Ecclesiastical Affairs.— Both the parish churches 
are in the town. The High Church, in which English alone is 
preached, was built in 1772, and is a large plain building attached 
to an old square tower, said to have been erected by Oliver Crom- 
well, and is seated for 1800 persons. It is, however, found too 
small for the increasing congregation, and the erection of another 
or additional parish church is contemplated. The Gaehc church, 
which is properly the parish church, and in which Gaelic alone is 
preached, was erected in 1794, and contains about 1200 sitters,

the poor having access to it and the other building gratis. It is 
provided with an old and elegantly carved oak pulpit. The other 
congregations in Inverness are, of Episcopalians about 130 mem- 
bers; Seceders, 100; Independents, including a fevy Baptists, 50 ; 
Methodists, 50 ; Roman Catholics, 230. The ministers of some 
of these congregations are paid by their flocks, and others are 
understood to be partly assisted by societies in the south. In 
1798, a Chapel of Ease was erected in connection with the Esta- 
blished church, capable of containing 1100 sitters, the minister of 
which is supported by his own congregation alone. The Established 
clergy are three in number, the patronage to the first and third 
livings being vested in the Crown, — that to the second in Mr Eraser 
of Lovat, who also claims a vice-presentation of the first charge. 
None of the ministers have manses, but the first and second re- 
ceive a very trifling yearly sum, being the interest of the sums for 
which the old manses with the gardens attached to them were sold 
many years ago as ruinous, the Court of Session having decided, 
after a long and expensive litigation, that the heritors were not 
obliged to rebuild them. They also have each about four acres of 
glebe land, which they set for gardens, and on parts of which the 
tenants have erected many substantial houses. These yield at 
present each about L. 80 a year. The stipends of the first and 
second charges are 19 chalders of grain, with L. 10 for commu- 
nion elements ; and the stipend of the third minister, which is 
partly paid from the holders of the old Bishop of Moray's rents, and 
partly by Parliamentary grant, is L. 200, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for 
communion elements. A parish catechist is employed, who is 
paid from the collections at the church doors, the rest of which, 
after paying beadles, &amp;c. are appropriated to the poor, and for 
whom also there are four special quarterly collections in the year. 
The number of communicants in the two parish churches varies 
from 800 to 900, and in the chapel of ease from 300 to 350. 

Education and Societies. — The local Bible Society here for se- 
veral years collected an annual fund from L. 100 to L. 140, but 
its meetings have been discontinued for some time. It has sup- 
plied, on two occasions, every family 'in the parish with Bibles. 

Inverness Education Society. — In 1818, a society was institut- 
ed under the name of the " Society for Educating the Poor in the 

 The occasional sitters in these Seceding, Independent, and Methodist chapels 
augment considerably the usual attendance, the numbers stated being of those in full 
communion with each congregation. The numbers of Episcopalians and Roman 
Catholics given, include men, woinen, and children.

Highlands," which erected a central or model school in Inverness 
of a large size, and which is generally attended by about 300 scho- 
lars. It has been of much use to the poor of the town, especially 
of the suburb on the Green of Muirtown, and the society's opera- 
tions extend beyond it to the establishment of schools in the more 
remote and thinly peopled parts of the Highlands, twelve of which 
sort it supports at present ; and towards the maintenance of schools 
already existing, and supported partly by local funds, by giving a 
small aid or allowance to the teacher. In these aid schools, which 
have been of incalculable use in encouraging the efforts of the 
people, the society has under its protection upwards of 1000 chil- 
dren during the winter half of each year. The sums expended 
by this society for the education of the poor, from its institution in 
1818 to the 30th September 1834, amount to L. 8023. 

Raining' s School, life. — In the year 1747, Mr John Raining of 
Norwich bequeathed L. 1000 for building and endowing a school 
in any part of the Highlands the General Assembly should ap- 
point. The Assembly fixed on Inverness, and soon afterwards de- 
volved the management of the school on the Society for Propagat- 
ing Christian Knowledge, transferring the residue of the money to 
that body. At present it is conducted, as it has been for many 
years, by two excellent teachers, having under their charge about 
250 pupils, on salaries of L. 48 and L. 40 a-year besides their 
lodgings and gardens. The society last mentioned support two 
other schools in the landward part of the parish, allowing to the 
teachers salaries of L. 17 and L. 15 a-year. The suburb of In- 
verness called Merkincli has also been supplied by subscription 
with a large public school for the poor, which is attended by from 
200 to 300 scholars. There is also a school at Dochgarroch, sup- 
ported by the Committee of the General Assembly ; and both in 
the town and country there are many private elementary schools, 
besides an infant school opened in the year 1832, and which is 
generally attended by about 90 children, in some of which the 
classics and the principles of geography, mathematics, and naviga- 
tion are taught. There are also several ladies' day and boarding 
schools in Inverness ; and the Sabbath evening schools for religious 
instruction in the burgh are attended by about 450 children, there 
beino- likewise a few of the same description in the landward part 
of the parish. 

In the year 1792, an academy was opened in Inverness, for the 
education of the families of the upper classes in the Highlands ge-

iierally, as well as; of the town and neighbourhood, the funds for 
that purpose having been collected by subscriptions at home and 
abroad ; and its directors, consisting of the magistrates of Inver- 
ness, the sheriff of the county, the moderator of the presbytery of 
Inverness, with five commissioners of supply, to be named annual- 
ly by their own body, subscribers of L. 50, and the heirs of sub- 
scribers to the extent of L. 100, or upwards, being incorporated 
into a body corporate and poHtic, by royal charter. The old gram- 
mar school of Inverness has merged into this institution, to which 
the burgh transferred its annual grant for the support of the for- 
mer, and it is generally provided with from four to six teachers, includ- 
ing a rector, whose salary, besides a free house and garden, amounts 
to L. 90, and the other teachers' salaries from L. 30 to L. 40 a- 
year. All the branches of a good commercial and classical edu- 
cation are taught in this seminary, with the elements of mathema- 
tics and philosophy, there being a prospect also of the natural 
sciences being added to the branches taught, in consequence of a 
society established in the year 1825, and denominated the Northern 
Institution for the Promotion of Science and Literature, having made 
over to the academy directors their valuable museum of books, an- 
tiquities, and objects of natural history. For some years this aca- 
demy was the only seminary of the kind to the north of Aberdeen ; 
but, in consequence chiefly of similar institutions being opened in 
many of the neighbouring towns, the numbers attending it have 
somewhat decreased, the average amount of pupils being formerly 
upwards of 300, while at present it is only attended by from 200 
to 250 scholars. Inverness, thus already more amply provided than 
many other towns with the means of education and improvement 
has been further enriched by a munificent bequest of L. 10 OOo' 
3 per cent, consols, left by the late Rev. Dr Bell, the ingenious 
author of the Madras system of education, and committed by him 
to the charge of the magistrates of Inverness, who contemplate 
we understand, erecting another large charity school, and relieving 
the Education Society of the burthen of supporting their central 
or model school on the Green of Muirtown. 

Libraries, §-.-Besides its scientific and literary institution 
above-mentioned, Inverness has also a mechanics institution, a va- 
luable parochial library, under the direction of the kirk-session se- 
veral subscription and circulating libraries, two public reading- 
rooms, several printing-presses, two weekly newspapers, and four 
»an king-offices.

By an estimate of the state of education in tliis parish made in 
1826, and pubhshed in the « Moral Statistics" of the Inverness 
Society for Educating the Poor in the Highlands, it appeared that 
at that time there were in this parish of persons from eight to 
twenty years of age who could not read, 1007, and above twenty 
years of age unable to read 1444. It is believed these numbers are 
now greatly reduced. 

The total number of scholars attending school in the parish in 
the course of a year is about 1800. 

Infirmary, — In the year 1804, the large and handsome Infir- 
mary, already mentioned, was opened here, with a Lunatic Asylum 
attached to it, for the use of the northern counties of Scotland. Its 
accommodations are extensive and elegant : the rooms and wards 
are large, well-ventilated, and clean, and, from the recent addition 
of hot and cold baths, and several new rooms, and the entire se- 
paration of the maniac department from the rest of the establish- 
ment, this institution is surpassed by none of the same description 
in Scotland. The buildings were completed by subscription pro- 
cured chiefly through the exertions of the magistrates of Inverness, 
and more especially of William Inglis, Esq., many years provost 
of the town, and a man of uncommon activity, enterprise, and zeal 
for the public good. The institution is now under the manage- 
ment of the body just mentioned, joined to the Estabhshed minis- 
ters of the parish ; the moderator of the presbytery ; the sheriff 
of Inverness-shire; five commissioners of supply chosen annually; 
donors of L. 50, and upwards ; annual subscribers of L. 5 ; certain 
medical gentlemen ; and five persons annually elected at a gene- 
ral meeting of the whole managers. This hospital has a small in- 
vestment in money, but is chiefly dependent for support on private 
subscriptions and parochial collections throughout the Highlands. 
The annual expenditure was at one time about L. 700. Now it 
is considerably below that sum, and, while it would appear that the 
cost of each patient until his cure or dismissal was at first on an 
average L. 4, 14s. Ifd., it has since the year 1820 been reduced 
to the average of L. 2, 19s. 3d., and in some years did not exceed 
the very small sum of L. 2 ;— an expenditure clearly establishing 
the beneficial effects of union, economy, and co-operation, in af- 
fordino- relief to the diseased poor. From the institution of the 
hospital in 1804 up to the 20th December 1833, the number of 
patients including those in the town of Inverness, who received 
advice and medicines in their own houses, and manaics, amounted 



INVERNESS. 33 

to 9247. A house-surgeon, a matron, besides nurses and keepers, 
and the male and female-servants, constantly reside in the Infirmary • 
and the medical managers in Inverness give their attendance gratis 
by rotation. 

Dispensanj.—\n 1832 a Dispensary was opened by subscription 
on the Green of Muirtown, for bestowing medicines gratuitously 
to the sick poor, and it has proved of much use, e'specially during 
the visitations of cholera. 

Friendhj Societies.— Theve are at present nine Friendly Societies 
in Inverness, the average rates of contribution to which are from 
Is. 6d. to 2s. per. quarter, with 10s. to 15s. of entry money, and 
a small extra contribution on account of the expense of a member's 
funeral. When ill a member receives from 3s. to 5s. a week; but 
if he is disabled from work for more than six weeks he then gets a 
quarterly allowance proportioned to the state of the funds, which 
It IS believed are not at present increasing. When prudently and 
honestly managed these societies have certainly done good. 

Savings Bank.— Theve is no savings bank receiving deposits 
trom the mdustrious poor at present,— a circumstance much to be 
regretted. - It was discontinued on the death of the individual who 
latterly conducted it. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-The Sunday collections for the 
poor average m the year amount to L. 100; four special quarterly 
collections at L. 42, to L. 168.; rents of kirk-session lands, and in- 
terest of money left by charitable persons for the parochial poor, 
L. 192 ; total, L. 460 ; -out of which, besides providing for burials 
orphans, and other contingencies, the kirk-session furnish pecuniary 
assistance to about 310 paupers, by stated weekly or quarterly al- 
lowances, varying from 6d, a week to L. 1 and L. 2 a year  

The magistrates of the town have also several charitable mor- 
tifications at their disposal, the interests of which are laid out for 

r f \/r T ""''' '"""' L. 717. A fund left by 

Zl A '"f" «f Gl-'gow, for the support of 

decayed householders, is now worth L. 3845. A German of the 
name of Klien, m 1803, bequeathed a sum for the same purpose, of 
dos  F "f.'T"'" V"" Mackintosh of Farr, and of the Hin- 
name of Mackintosh, of the families of Farr, Holm, Dalmigavy, and

Flichity, at the Inverness academy, now worth about L. 28,218. 
The annual products of these charities vary according as they are 
invested in the town's funds or Government securities. 

There is no compulsory assessment for the support of the poor; 
and we trust there will not, as it would probably increase pauper- 
ism, by encouraging the habits which lead to it." 

Prisons.— The ancient jail of Inverness consisted only of a smgle 
damp dincy vault, in one of the arches of the stone bridge, and 
which subsequentlv used as a mad-house was only closed up about 
fifteen years ago. It was succeeded by another prison m Bridge 
Street, which, from the notices of it in the burgh's records, must 
also have been a most unhealthy and disagreeable place of confine- 
ment The present jail was erected in 1791, and cost L. 1800, 
the spire having cost about L. 1600 more. Besides prisoners for 
debt, all those charged with crimes from the northern counties are 
sent here previous to their trial before the circmt courts of Jus- 
ticiary, which sit at Inverness twice a-year. Although a great im- 
provement at the time of its erection, this prison is now found to 
be too small and very inconvenient, there being no proper classi- 
fication of delinquents, while there is no open court or yard tor 
them to walk in, nor can any manual employment be required ot 
them at present. There is no bridewell or poors-house in this pa- 
rish. By the subsisting law the expense of the jail's support falls 
on the magistrates of the burgh, who are also answerable for the 
safe custody of the prisoners; but the heritors of the northern 
counties contemplate the erection of a new jad on the Castlehdl, 
on a large scale, and under a more modern system of prison dis- 
cipline. Unless subjected to some manual labour or solitary con- 
finement, it seems questionable whether the superior accommoda- 
tions of modern prisons do not render access to them, m many 
cases, a privilege rather than a punishment. , , 

Pair..- Anciently all classes of the community depended much 
for the supply of necessaries on the public fairs, held in such towns 
as Inverness, and which were in consequence attended by great 
crowds, the merchants' booths being kept open for weeks together. 
At present there are four great fairs held in the year at Inverness 
for the sale of dairy produce, and of manufactured goods, and 
coarse household stuffs, made by the Highland women m the neigh- 
bourhood ; but the establishment of shops throughout the country 
Wreat ly diminished their importance, and the magistrates of 
t fown, to avoid the rioting and intemperance which sometimes 



INVERNESS. gg 



encroached on the quiet of Sunday, have lately curtailed the mar- 
ket time of each fair from the forenoon of Wednesday to the after- 
noon of Friday. The show of horses and cattle at the Inverness 
fairs is now much less than it used to be previous to the establish- 
ment of several cattle trysts in the neighbourhood. In the month 
of July, however, in each year, a great wool-market is held in this 
town, at which the principal Highland sheep-farmers, from all the 
northern counties, are wont to meet the south of Scotland and 
Enghsh wool-staplers and agents, and at which sales to the extent 
at least of 100,000 stones of wool are annually effected, besides 
numerous exchanges among the sellers and drovers from the south 
of their various kinds and ages of sheep, which exceed in amount 
100,000 carcases a-year. • The prices fixed at this fair generally 
regulate those of all the other markets in the country, as well as 
the subsequent sales of the farmers who are not present at it; but 
these prices fluctuate so frequently, from causes little understood, 
that we do not conceive it necessary to quote them ; and, indeed,' 
the prices of past years are not found to influence those of the 
next season. 

Besides the markets now alluded to, every Tuesday and Friday 
are ordinary market days in Inverness for butcher-meat, eo-as, 
poultry, and farm and garden produce; and on a certain day every 
half year there is a fair on the Exchange of Inverness for the hiring 
of farm-servants. 

7h2s.— Inverness has been long celebrated for the excellency of 
Its mns— the Caledonian hotel especially being inferior to none in 
Scotland. Besides the accommodation of parlours, and laro-e sit- 
tmg-rooms, and a spacious ball-room, Mr Wilson, the keeper'of the 
hotel, can make down upwards of eighty beds, and insure private 
lodgmgs m town to such strangers as require them. His coach 
and posting establishment is also great. The number of licensed 
inns and alehouses is 52 in the burgh, and 19 in the landward 
portions of the parish. 

2MZ.-Coals from Sunderland and Newcastle, and a small quan- 
tity of Scotch coals from the coal basin of the Forth, constitute 
the principal fuel in Inverness. Wood is not extensively used, but 
peats employed principally for kindling coal-fires, are brought to 
town from the upland districts, and sell from Is., to Is. 6d. the 
small cart load. Coals sell from lOd. to Is. 6d. the barrel of two 
heaped imperial bushels.

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF ABERTABFE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. JAMES DOUNE SMITH, MINISTER  



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
JVawe.— The meaning of the word Urquhart is now unknown ; 
but as there are several parishes of that name in the Highlands, 
Urquhart on Loch Ness was anciently called Urchudin Cill ma 
Chrossan, as being the residence of Saint Crossan or Crostan, and 
latterly as Urchudin Thiarna Ghrant, or the Laird of Grant's Ur- 
quhart. Glenmoriston or Glenmore-Essan, " the glen of the great 
waterfall," derives its name from the beautiful cascades on the 
river which flows through it, of which those near the mouth are the 
largest and most picturesque. 

Anciently, the parish of Glenmoriston was united to that of 
Abertarff, and it is behoved that it was when the latter was con- 
nected with Boleskine that the former was joined to Urquhart. 
Since the suppression of Popery, at least, the two parishes have 
had but one minister, the glebe and parish church being situated 
at Kilmore, on the margin of the bay of Urquhart, a portion of 
Loch Ness, being thus placed at the extremity of the larger but 
more populous district of Glen Urquhart. 

Extent and Boundaries.— This exquisitely beautiful parish, 
which is more varied in mountain, hill, and dale, lake and streani, 
« the warbling wood, the pomp of groves and garniture of fields," 
than perhaps any other in the Highlands, is about 30 miles 
long, and in general from 8 to 12 miles broad, though the 
extreme breadth along the northern bank of Loch Ness, from 
the confines of Aberiachan to Invermoriston, extends to about 
15 miles. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Inver- 
ness, Kirkhill, and Kiltarlity; on the east by Loch Ness; on the 
south by the united parishes of Boleskine and Abertarff, and part 
of Kilmonivaig; on the south-west by the parishes of Glenshiel and

URQUHART AND GLENMORISTON.

Kintail in Ross-sliire ; and on the west and north-west by the dis- 
trict and alpine valley of Strathglass, which lies in the parishes of 
Kilmorack and Kiltarlity. 

Topographical Appearances. — Glen Urquhart and Glenmoris- 
ton, which are the only transverse valleys branching off from the 
north side of Loch Ness, form the principal and most populous 
divisions or portions of this parish, the rest being high and moun- 
tainous, and resorted to only for pasture, and peat, which consti- 
tutes the natural fuel of the district. These glens, proceeding in 
a south-west and nearly parallel direction, are respectively about 
nine and twelve miles long, and are separated by high heathy hills, 
which terminate immediately above Loch Ness, in the great round- 
backed mountain of Maulfuarmhonvie, or Mealfuarvonie, lite- 
rally, the height or lump of the cold moor, whose dome-shaped 
summit attains an elevation of 3200 feet; while, in the opposite 
direction, these valleys usher us to the plain of Corrymony and the 
ridges overhanging Strathglass on the one hand, and on the other 
to the great moorland or table-ground which stretches around 
Loch Cluany and the bases of the peaked mountains of Kintail. 

Glenmoriston, except near its mouth, where it is flat and deeply 
sunk among the high steep pine and birch-clad hills which rise ab- 
ruptly on both sides of it, is an inclined valley, expanding in width 
as we ascend, and displaying in great extent and luxuriance the 
rounded forms and lively green of a birch forest, which stretch far 
up the mountain sides from the dark and mingled masses of native 
pine, oak, and roan-tree lining the rocky banks of the impetuous 
torrent, which forces its tortuous course along the centre of the 
glen. It is hence but little cultivated, and the district is almost 
exclusively a pastoral one. The lower parts of the valley, indeed, 
are almost entirely covered with birches, and towards the interio 
the hills are crowned with noble woods of the Scotch fir or pine. 
Urquhart, on the other hand, expands first from the waters of 
Loch Ness into a beautiful semicircular plain, divided by regu- 
larly shaped fields and hedge-rows, and having all the hill sides 
above it beautifully diversified by woods and cultivated grounds, 
where persevering labour is seen overcoming all the obstacles of 
situation and climate, and carrying tillage to a great elevation. By 
the course of the river Coiltie, which waters the southern side of 
this plain, the receding and smaller sized stripes of corn ground 
are seen extending into the natural domains of the birch tree and 
brown heath of the upland pastures ; while the Enneric water on

the west leads the eye past the white walls of the large and ex- 
cellent inn of Drumnadrochit, which corrupt word signifies " the 
height above the bridge," beyond which a reach of two or three 
miles of haugh land affording room for some of the best farms in 
the district, and the site of its most populous hamlets, conducts 
to a rocky pass or gorge : on turning this we attain the upper 
or inland valley of Urquhart, which is almost circular, its centre 
being occupied by Loch Meikly, an elegant sheet of water, about 
one mile long, and half a mile broad, from the edges of which 
arise the green and highly improved lawns and cultivated grounds 
of Lakefield and Lochletter. Over a heathy ridge beyond these 
we reach, two or three miles farther on, the flat of Corrymony, 
which is adorned by some very large ash and beech trees, and 
where cultivation has been successfully introduced to a consider- 
able extent, at a distance of twenty-five miles from the sea, and at 
least 800 or 900 feet above it. 

Meteorology and Hydrography. — The parish, from its inland si- 
tuation, partakes of a mixed climate, intermediate between the ex- 
cessive moisture of the west coast and the cold dry atmosphere of 
some of the eastern counties, — the piercing blasts in spring which 
proceed from the German Ocean being less severely felt here than 
in the low country. The district is hence, on the whole, very heal- 
thy, and some of the inhabitants attain extreme old age. 

The line of junction between the primary and sandstone rocks 
described below is distinguished all round the parish by unusual- 
ly great excavations and undulations of the ground, which, being 
partially filled with rain-water, have given rise to an almost continu- 
ed chain of tarns, or small lakes or marshes in the higher districts ; 
and these being bordered with rushes and belts of the white and 
yellow loater-lily, form the nestling places of large flocks of wild 
fowl. Of Loch Ness, the south-eastern boundary of the parish, 
no description need be given here, as an account of it more natu- 
rally belongs to another parish. At the base of the upper accli- 
vity of Mealfaurvonie, which is perpendicular on the north and 
south sides, nearly so on the west, and connected by a long taper- 
ino- ridge with the rest of the mountain on the east, a small circu- 
lar lake exists which was once thought to be unfathomable, and 
supposed by the credulous neighbours to be united under ground 
with Loch Ness, but which has now been found to be compara- 
tively shallow. From its western extremity it discharges a small 
streamlet called Atdtsigh or « the Resting burn," which, tumbling 



URQUHART AND GLENMORISTON. 



39 



down along a rocky channel at the base of one of the gi-andest 
frontlets of rock in the Highlands, nearly 1500 feet high, empties 
itself into Loch Ness within three miles of Invermoriston. This 
burn constitutes the boundary between Urquhart and Glenmoris- 
ton ; and, besides the magnificent rocky and woodland scenery with 
which its course is lined, it is farther worthy of notice as display- 
ing near its mouth_ an unusually beautiful waterfall, and another 
equally fine one about two miles farther up, shaded with foliage 
of the richest dye. On the summit of the hill to the west of the 
burn, there is a rocking-stone, which two persons can move, about 
twenty feet in circumference. 

This burn's parent lake is also supposed occasionally when swol- 
len to send off a streamlet towards the north or, at least, the hol- 
low or rather deep ravine which collects the infant waters of the 
Coiltie, which flows along the southern margin of the vale of Ur- 
quhart, begins very near the northern extremity of this loch. 

The Coiltie, from the elevation of its springs, is a most rapid 
and sometimes dangerous rivulet, which carries down enormous 
masses of stone that choke up its channel, and cause it to overflow 
its banks, and destroy, not only the corn-land, but sometimes also 
houses and bridges. 

A tributary of this water, called the Divach, amid beautiful and 
dense groves of birch, displays a waterfall as high and picturesque 
as that of Foyers ; and near the source of the Enneric river, which . 
flows from Corrymony into the still basin of Loch Meikly, another 
smaller, though highly picturesque cascade, called the Fall of Mo- 
ral, is to be seen. Near it, is a cave capable of receiving sixteen 
or twenty persons, in which several of the principal gentlemen of 
the district for a time concealed themselves from the Hanoverian 
soldiers after the Rebellion of 1745. The Falls of Divach are sel- 
dom supplied with a sufficiency of water to give them that decided 
grandeur which they possess when the rivers are in speat, as their 
swollen state is significantly called; but then the mountains sides are 
everywhere streaked round with foaming cataracts, which disappear 
on the return of fair weather. The burn which falls from Abe- 
riachan on the confines of the parish of Inverness, displays a suc- 
cession of beautiful perpendicular falls and running cataracts; and 
that of Aultcjuisli, or the Fir-tree burn, in the forest of Ruisky, 
eastward of Aultsigh, presents a continuous cataract, which, from 
the lake below, looks like a long white ribbon streaking the moun-

tain side, and part of which consists of a single leap at least 100 
feet high. 

Geology. — The whole neighbourhood of Loch Ness seems for- 
merly to have been subjected to great volcanic action and large 
eruptions of granite; and although this parish does not exhibit 
much granite en masse, yet its primitive rocks everywhere display 
the intrusion of various sets of granitic veins. At the summit of 
Gienmoriston, and around Loch Cluany, a beautiful white porphy- 
ritic granite, with large distinct crystals of felspar, occupies an 
extensive tract of country. Beneath, in the glen itself, and along 
both sides of the river Moriston, stratified gneiss prevails ; but at 
the eastern boundary of Urquhart, on the confines of the parish of 
Inverness, another large deposit of whitish granite occurs, which 
constitutes several of the hills encircling the moss of Caiplich, and 
is connected with the red granites of Dochfour and Aberiachan, 
described in the account of the parish of Inverness. From behind 
the farm of Polmailly in Glen Urquhart, a formation of unstrati- 
fied Serpentine rock proceeds in a north-west direction, constitut- 
ing three prominent summits, with several subordinate ridges, and 
extending 2 or 3 miles in length, and about 1 mile or 1 in breadth. 
It is distinguished by the dirty-brown colour of the surface, and the 
extreme sterility of the hills formed of it, — the serpentine here as 
elsewhere permitting but few trees, and hardly a blade of grass, to 
grow upon it. No beds of chromate of iron or other useful mine- 
rals have as yet been discovered in this deposit, which, however, 
has not been minutely examined, nor has the serpentine been po- 
lished or employed as an ornamental stone. It is contained in 
strata of gneiss, which abound in beds of gray and white primitive 
granular limestone, which is partially burnt and used for domestic 
purposes by the farmers of the district. The limestone contains 
very beautiful and numerous suits of actynolite, tremolite, and 
asbestus; besides which, several varieties of mica, hornblende, and 
bronzite, are occasionally found, — the hornblende also occurring, 
both massive and slaty, and highly crystallized, in beds of various 
sizes, and discovered generally in contact with veins of granite. 

But the most important rock, in a geological point of view, in 
this district, has yet to be noticed. It consists of a great over- 
lying and unconformable deposit of old red sandstone and its asso- 
ciated coarse conglomerate, and constitutes the summits next to 
Loch Ness, and the lower and more fertile portions of the vale of 
Urquhart. This deposit has been superimposed on the gneiss 



URQUHART AND GLENMORISTON. 



41 



rocks, and upheaved in very many places from its original horizon- 
tal position by the granitic invasion from below. To what extent 
the altitude of Mealfaurvonie may be owing to granitic displace- 
ment we have no means of determining ; but it is remarkable that 
the great upper dome or rounded summit of this mountain, which 
is elevated, as already noticed, 3200 feet above the sea, is one en- 
tire mass of conglomerate rock, the abraded portions consisting 
of granite, gneiss, mica-slate, quartz rock, and sandstone, cohering 
together almost without any basis or cement, and that the strati- 
fied sandstone at its base has been so indurated, probably from the 
influence of a subjacent but contiguous mass of granite, as in many 
places to have lost its distinctly stratified disposition, and to have 
acquired so hard and crystalline a texture as has rendered it fit to 
be used as a causeway stone for the streets of Inverness. The 
hardened variety has sometimes been described as quartz rock. 
This enormous sandstone deposit is now disjoined from the simi- 
lar rocks which composed the eastern termination of the Great 
Glen by Loch Ness, and the granitic hills of Caiplich and Doch- 
four; but when surveyed from Mealfaurvonie the conglome- 
rate ridges of Foyers and Balliechernock, described in the Ac- 
count of Dores parish, appear once to have been connected with 
It ; while on the north, across the valley of Urquhart, the junction 
with the main eastern deposit of sandstone is completed through 
the upper braes of Kiltarlity. 

We have mentioned that the portion of Glen Urquhart next 
Loch Ness consists of the stratified sandstone and its associated 
conglomerate. Of the latter, almost all the eminences which sur- 
round it are composed ; and beneath their rough and bare sum- 
mits a broad plateau, gently declining towards the centre of the 
valley occurs,— on the inner Hp or edge of which the sides of the 
glen sink rapidly down, showing that the bases of the higher 
summits were at one time washed by a great body of water, which 
rested on the plateau just mentioned, and which subsequently dis- 
charged Itself by the trough below forming the present course of 
the river Enneric. In causing these excavations, the waters ap. 
pear to have encountered three principal barriers; one now open- 
ed into Loch Ness, at the mouth of the valley, one stretching across 
Irom Graigmony, a little to the west of Drumnadrochit, and one at 
or above Dalshangy, where the separation between the upper and 
lower valleys is still visible. 

Several beautiful terraced banks, indicative of more recent ef. 



42 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



fects of water, encircle the vale of Urquhart on all sides, of which 
two are particularly distinct, being elevated about 20 and 50 feet 
respectively above the level of Loch Ness, and which, from their 
horizontal surface and smooth sloping sides, furnish fine banks for 
young plantations, and picturesque sites for cottages. 

The soils in this parish, though light, are on the whole warm 
and productive, and, from the prevalence of secondary rocks, rather 
more clayish than is common in Highland districts. The subsoil 
is except where peat mosses have been reclaimed universally 
gravel, more or less porous, and with which every hill side and 
every valley has been strewn over by ancient currents of water to 
a considerable depth. 

There are no metalliferous mines in the district, and no beds of 
lime quarried to any great extent, — the burnt lime of England, from 
the want of coals here, being on the whole to be got nearly as 
cheap as the local deposits could be wrought. Boulder, or loose 
field stones, are much used in the construction of houses and en- 
closures, and the only extensive quarry in the district is one which 
was opened in the sandstone inchning to quartz rock of Ruisky 
in front of Mealfaurvonie, and not much above the edge of Loch 
Ness, for supplying with large stones the works of the Caledonian 
Canal at Fort Augustus. It has not been used for some years, 
except to furnish paving or rather causeway stones for the streets 
of Inverness. 

Botamj.— The banks of Loch Ness, and especially the portion 
between the bay of Urquhart and Invermoriston, are distinguished 
for the richness and variety of their vegetable productions. The 
space just mentioned contains the old forest of Ruisky, the top of 
which consists of native pine trees, with oaks, ashes, and hoary 
hawthorns, stretching in detached stems and clumps along the pre- 
cipitous rocks, and which, descending below, mingle themselves with 
the dense woods of birch which cover all the lower acclivities to 
the water's edge. The sloe, holly, guelder-rose, trembling poplar, 
alder, mountain-ash, or rowan-tree, with long trailing brambles, and 
the largest sized white and red rose bushes, increase the variety and 
beauty of the foliage, and when mixed with hazel and rasp bushes, 
create an almost impassable copse. Here and there are seen some 
enormous indigenous elms and gean trees ; and throughout the dis- 
trict the beautiful white flowering bird-cherry or hackberry, as it is 
called, {Pruius padus, is most abundantly distributed, and attains 
an uncommonly large size ; while the gardens and pleasure-grounds

at Invermoriston, Balmacaan, Polmailly, Kilmore, Lakefield, and 
Corrymony, show that the soil and climate are adapted for the 
growth of the finest larches, planes, sycamores, beeches, walnuts, 
and all sorts of fruit trees. In Ruisky are to be seen the remnants 
of the larger sized birch trees, which are now become scarce in the 
country, many of the trunks being 5 or 6, and a few even 8 or 9 
feet in circumference. Their wrinkled and hoary branches sup- 
port great quantities of parasitic mosses and lichens, and the green 
sward around them abounds in an unusual variety of wood and 
meadow plants ; but the moors scarcely attain a sufficient elevation 
for the support of the truly Alpine flora. Even Mealfaurvonie, 
notwithstanding its great height, hardly shows any Alpine plants, 
except Saxifraga aizoides, Hieracium alpinum, and Alcheviilla al~ 
pina. Among the rarer small plants of the parish may be enumerat- 
ed Adoxa moschatellina, Agrimonia Eupatorium, Betula nana, Cir- 
cea Lutetiana et alpina, Epilobium angustifolium, Geranium luci- 
dum, Habenaria viridis, albida et bifolia, Paris quadrifolia, Pyrola 
media, minor, et secunda, Saxifraga hypnoides, Vaccinium oxycoc- 
cosl Arbutus alpina. The bogs and peat mosses abound in trunks 
and roots of oaks and fir trees, greater in size than are now seen 
in the native forests, and when these cannot be dug out in large 
pieces, they are split up for fire wood. 

Animals. — The only wild animals now found in this district are, 
the fox, badger, polecat, weasel, and wild-cat. Tradition, and 
some faint notices in old chronicles, assert that the beaver as well 
as the wolf inhabited the sides of Loch Ness. The capercaillie 
or cock of the wood, {Urogallus vidgaris, was seen in Glenmoris- 
ton, and the neighbouring hills of Strathglass, about seventy years 
ago, but is now quite extinct. Red-deer, roe, black and red grouse, 
ptarmigan, with brown and white or Alpine hares, still abound on 
all the estates in the district. Goats were formerly numerous, but 
they have of late been greatly discountenanced, as injurious to the 
woods and plantations. 

II. — Civil History. 
Antiquities.— The state of property, and the history of this dis- 
trict in ancient times, would be utterly unknown, but for the few 
gleams of light thrown on them by the annals of the Castle of Ur- 
quhart, one of the chain of fortresses several of them royal 
which, from the earliest times, stretched across the Great Glen 
from Inverness to Inverlochy, and secured the country from foreign 
invasion, and the excess of civil discord. In the present sketch,

INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



therefore, this castle merits our first regard. Perched on the west- 
ern promontory of Urquhart bay, it overhangs Loch Ness, and is 
built on a detached rock, separated from the adjoining hill, at the 
base of which it lies, by a moat about 25 feet deep, and 16 broad. 
The rock is crowned by the remains of a high wall, or curtain, sur- 
rounding the buildings, the principal of which, a strong square keep 
of three stories, is still standing, surmounted by four square hang- 
ing turrets. This outward wall encloses a spacious area, and is in 
some places terraced; and in the angles were platforms for the 
convenience of the defending soldiery. The entrance was by a 
spacious gateway, between two guard-rooms, projected beyond the 
general line of the walls, and was guarded by more than one mas- 
sive portal, and a huge portcullis. These entrance-towers are much 
in the style of architecture peculiar to the castles of Edward I. 
of England ; and in front of them lay the drawbridge across the 
outer moat. The whole works were extensive and strong, and the 
masonry was better finished than is common in the generality of 
Scottish strongholds. They could have accommodated 500 or 600 
men. 

The first siege Urquhart Castle is known to have sustained was 
in the year 1303, when it was taken by the officers of Edward L, 
who were sent forward by him to subdue the country from Kil- 
drummie, near Nairn, — beyond which he did not advance in per- 
son ; and, of all the strongholds in the north, it was that which 
longest resisted the eff'orts of his arms. Alexander de Bois, the 
brave governor, and his garrison, were put to the sword. Sir Ro- 
bert Lauder of Quarrelwood, in Morayshire, was governor of the 
castle, A. D. 1334, and maintained it against the Baliol faction. 
His daughter, marrying the laird of Chisholm in Strathglass, the 
off"spring of their union, Sir Robert Chisholm of that ilk, be- 
came laird of Quarrelwood in right of his mother, and constable 
of Urquhart Castle in right of his grandfather. After this period, 
it is known to have been a royal fort or garrison ; but it is very 
likely it was so also at the commencement of the fourteenth cen- 
tury, and existed as such in the reigns of the Alexanders, and 
other early Scottish sovereigns. A gentleman in Inverness is 
in possession of an original charter of this Sir Robert Chisholm 
to the church of the Holy Cross, in Inverness, of certain lands 
near the town, dated on the feast of the Epiphany, 1362. In 1359, 
the barony and castle of Urquhart were disponed by David II. to 
William Earl of Sutherland and his son John. 



URQUHART AND GLENMORISTON. 



45 



Subsequently it was held for the king by the great family of 
Grant of Freuchie, now styled Grant of Grant, who obtained pos- 
session of most of the lands around it, constituting the domains 
of the castle, as the crown's chamberlains ; and finally, in the year 
1509, when King James IV. was empowered by Parliament to set 
out in feu-farm the Royal lands, both annexed and unannexed, he 
granted three charters of the lordship of Urquhart and baronies 
of Urquhart and Glenmoriston, in different portions, to John 
Grant of Freuchie and his two sons, from the latter of whom are 
descended the families of the Grants of Glenmoriston and Corry- 
mony. 

On the brow of the hill fronting Loch Ness, and near the ham- 
let of Bunloit, there is a small vitrified fort called Dunscriben, 
which communicated with similar signal stations at the east end 
and centre of the great Caledonian valley; and about two miles west 
of the castle in Glen Urquhart rises a very prominent rocky hill, 
styled Craigmoni, which was partly encircled on the summit with 
rude walls of stone, and on which, tradition says, the ancient bea- 
con fires were lighted, besides its being used as the gallows hill of 
the old castle. In Argyleshire, a tradition prevails that a Danish 
or Norwegian prince of the name of Moni having landed in the dis- 
trict of Crinan, still known as the pass of Moni, and laid waste 
the country, was afterwards attacked by the native inhabitants, who 
routed his troops, and pursued him and a few of his followers, who 
with difficulty regained their ships, and fled northward towards 
Lochaber. Having reached Craigmoni, and established himself 
in the adjoining valley, still called Dalmoni, this son of the king of 
Lochlin or Norway, as he is styled in the country, seems afterwards 
to have been driven farther up into the interior, and to have perish- 
ed at Corrymony or Coiramhoni, the valley of Moni, where his 
grave  Uai Mhoni is still to be seen. 

The beautifully exposed and fine sloping grounds on the east 
side of the bay of Urquhart were early brought into culture, and 
belonged to the order of Knights Templars, or the Knights of St 
John of Jerusalem, some of whom were probably constables of the 
adjoining king's castle, and founders of a small religious house 
which stood on the point still called Temple, on the farm of Saint 
Ninians. 

The public burying-places in this parish were all probably formed 
round the shrines of saints or ancient chapels; and in Urquhart 
there is one at Kilmore, the great burying-ground, within which the 



46 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



present parish cliurcli stands; one at Cill-Santninian, near Temple; 
one at Cillmhichael, a short distance west of Drumnadrochit; and 
another in the height of the country at Corrymony, called Claodh 
Churidan, the burial-place of Curidan. In Glenmoriston, the se- 
questered and picturesquely lying burial place called Clachan au 
Inair, that is, the burying-ground of the lower" district, is situated 
at the mouth of the valley, and another higher up is denominated, 
in honour of an old saint, Clachan Merechard, the word Clachan, 
literally a stone, being the distinctive appellation for a fane or 
church. Numerous sepulchral cairns and circles of upright stones 
or ancient Pagan temples exist in the district, but none so large as 
to merit a particular description. 

Connected with antiquities, it is necessary to be borne in mind, 
that, owing to the inaccessible state of the country, and to the dis- 
tance at which the chiefs of the clan Grant resided from it, this 
district was, till after the suppression of the Rebellion in 1746, in 
a very unsettled and rather lawless condition. At that time, also, 
the population was beginning to be excessive, and the resident gen- 
try, from the want of employment for the young and daring minds 
with whom they were surrounded, had such difficulty in keeping 
them in subjection, that by some the breaking out of the Rebellion 
was regarded almost as a relief to their restlessness. But if such 
was the state of the districts bordering on the lowlands, those far- 
ther to the west were still more unhappy and unsettled ; and the in- 
habitants of Urquhart, who, besides the tending of cattle, had also 
begun to devote themselves to agriculture, were exposed to fre- 
quent depredations from the clans inhabiting the districts around 
Glengai-ry, Loch Eil, and Kintail. 

It may be added, that the burn of Aultsigh was, in the early part 
of the seventeenth century, the scene of a conflict, which is one of 
the most memorable connected with the parish, betwixt a party of 
the Macdonells of Glengarry, and the Mackenzies of Ross-shire. 

This has been commemorated in a celebrated pibroch called 
" the Raid of Cill- Christ," said to have been composed by the 
Glengarry piper during the conflagration of the church which oc- 
casioned the conflict. 

Land-owners. — The heritors or absolute proprietors of the lands 
in this parish are. Sir Lewis Alexander Grant of Grant, Baronet ; 
Earl of Seafield, whose seat in this district is at Balmacaan, in the 
lower valley of Urquhart ; James Murray Grant, Esq. of Glenmo- 
riston and Moy; Patrick Grant, Esq. of Lakefield; and Thomas 



URQUHART AND GLENMORISTON. 



47 



Ogilviej Esq. of Corrymony ; all of whom have residences on their 
estates. 

Public Work. — About sixty years ago a manufactory for linen 
cloth, and for instructing the youths of the neighbourhood in Eng- 
lish reading and the principles of the mechanical arts, was opened at 
Invermoriston, in a set of buildings erected for the purpose. Wea- 
vers and spinners, with a schoolmaster and mistress, or governess, were 
brought from the low country, and the management of the business 
was committed to a Mr Shaw of Inverness; but after a few years trial, 
the scheme was abandoned, without having materially promoted the 
purposes intended. It deserves to be remembered, however, as 
several attempts of a similar description were made much about 
the same time in various parts of Inverness-shire and Ross-shire, 
and which, unquestionably, had some effect in introducing the arts 
and industrious habits among the Highlanders. 

No other public work or manufactory exists at present in the 
united parishes, except a distillery recently commenced at Inver- 
moriston. 

III. — Population. 



The population in the parish of Urquhart in 18] 1 was 1944 

Glenmoriston, - 689 



Urquhart in 1821, 2180 
Glenmoriston, - 608 



Urquhart in 1831, 2383 
Glenmoriston, - 559 



2633 
2788 
2942 



The decrease in the district of Glenmoriston has been occasion- 
ed by emigration, consequent on the introduction of sheep-farming, 
to the partial exclusion of cattle, — that district of the parish having 
at no time been capable of supporting an agricultural population. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years has been 
82, and of marriages, 17. The register of baptisms is now regu- 
larly kept; but there is none of deaths. 

Language. — Gaelic is still universally spoken in this parish, 
though many even of the poorest inhabitants have acquired a know- 
ledge of the English language, which is daily gaining ground. 

Character of the People. — The people are a hardy industrious 
race, and, from the recent suppression of the trade in smuggled 
whisky, there is no doubt of their morals being in the course of 
improvement. Many of them marry young, notwithstanding that 
they are extremely poor. Their attachment to their landlords is 



48 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



still very great ; and we have no doubt, that, were occasion to re- 
quire it, the families of Grant of Grant and Glenmoriston could 
easily muster on their own estates, as they did during the last con- 
tinental war, a numerous and most active and intrepid body of sol- 
diers, willing to follow wherever their superiors would lead. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — In the district of Urquhart farming is carried on 
according to the most approved system of the south, and it would 
be useless to recapitulate here the particular features of it. The 
lands are now well limed, and produce crops of wheat, sown grasses, 
barley, oats, potatoes, and turnips; besides a considerable quan- 
tity of meadow hay obtained from the natural wet pastures. Al- 
most all the wheat raised, with a considerable portion of the oats, 
is in general sent to market to Inverness, but is occasionally ship- 
ped at Temple direct for London ; and for some years past a con- 
siderable quantity of potatoes has been exported for the London 
mai-ket.  

Besides the cattle kept in the low grounds, there are betwixt 
20,000 and 21,000 sheep supported on the hills of this parish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Hamlets. — There are no towns in this district, but in Glen Ur- 
quhart there are several hamlets of labourers, with a few trades- 
men, most of whom, besides working in the fields as hired ser- 
vants to the neighbouring farmers, have small crofts or gardens of 
their own. The principal hamlet, called Milntown, contains about 
36 cottages and 150 inhabitants, including women and children. 
The other small scattered hamlets may, in all, contain about 115 
inhabitants.  

Means of Communication. — Till towards the close of last cen- 
tury, the roads in the Highlands generally were exceedingly bad, 
and those in this parish were no better than bridle tracks. Soon 
after the year 1760, a better sort of road but in many places 
wanting drains and parapets was commenced between Inverness 
and Drumnadrochit by Loch Ness side, and, by dint of persever- 
ing exertions in applying the proceeds of the local statute labour 
money, and private subscriptions, aided by grants from the county 
of Inverness, it was at length completed, and even prolonged over 
the shoulder of Mealfaurvonie to Glenmoriston, where it ceased 
till the communication with the west coast was opened up through

agricultural produce of tlie parish. 



URQUHART AND GLENMORISTON, 49 

that valley by the Parliamentary Commissioners, appointed in the 
beginning of the present century for the formation of roads and 
bridges in the Highlands. Portions of the old road may still be 
seen winding along the impending rocky cliffs above Loch Ness ; 
and, although few travellers would now a-days trust themselves 
on such a promenade, persons are still alive who recollect that it was 
a day of great rejoicing in the district M'hen three gentlemen of Ur- 
quhart were first enabled to ride abreast all the way from Inverness. 
A branch of this district road was conducted up to the top of the 
glen at Corrymony, and another off-shoot across the hill of CoiUe 
Shallach or the boggy copse into the valley of Glenconvinth, 
thereby communicating with the Aird and the post-road from Ross- 
shire. Both of these district roads are at present kept in good 
repair. The southern boundary of the parish is now skirted all 
along by the new Parliamentary road, which proceeds from Inver- 
ness by the north side of Loch Ness, through Glenmoriston to 
Kintail and Skye. Its surface is excellent, but it is in some places 
rather narrow, too steep, and in need of continuous parapets. 
Portions of it were excavated out of the solid rock at great ex- 
pense and labour, the under side being propped up with high walls 
and buttresses. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The parish church, which stands in the 
lower part of the valley of Urquhart, within about half a mile of 
Loch Ness, was built in 1630. It is rather an ill constructed 
house ; and, although repaired in 1814, is in so dilapidated a state, 
besides being inadequate to accommodate the people who attend  
that It will be necessary to make immediate application for a new 
and larger building The minister officiates here two Sundays out 
of three, and the third at Miklie, six miles up the glen, where a 
commodious chapel or meeting-house was built about six years 
ago. There IS a missionary minister settled in Glenmoriston by 
the Committee for Managing the Royal Bounty,-who preaches 
alternately at Invermoriston and in the upper pJrt of the glen a 
each of wl.ch stations there is a comfortable meeting-house Both 
Gaehc and English are preached in the different places of worsh p 
- hm the parish with the exception of the one in the braes o 

lattrgrg'e.' ' - the 

There are no Dissenting or Seceding chapels in the parish, the 
'abitants all belonging to the Established church, with the ex- 
iNVKUNEtJ. tholic persuasion in

INVEHNESS-SHIRE. 



Glenmoriston. The people are regular in their attendance on 
divine ordinances ; and the number of communicants at present on 
the roll is 108. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, half barley and half meal, with L.8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements. The glebe consists of about six 
acres of arable land, and about half an acre" of pasture. The 
manse was built in 1800; and, having been repaired about seven 
years ago, is in tolerable condition. 

Education.— the Parochial School act, the heritors of exten- 
sive Highland parishes being allowed to divide the salary into two 
or three parts, advantage was taken of this clause in regard to 
Urquhart and Glenmoriston ; and, in consequence, there are three 
parochial schools in the parish,— one within half a mile of the pa- 
rish church, to which is allotted the half of the maximum salary 
allowed to schoolmasters; one at Miklie in the braes of Glen Ur- 
quhart ; and the third at Invermoriston,— the other half of the sa- 
lary being equally divided between the teachers of the two latter. 
There are two schools in the parish supported by the Society in 
Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge,— one m Bun- 
loit of Urquhart, and the other in the braes of Glenmoriston. 
Besides these, there are three other schools taught by individuals, 
who depend entirely for remuneration on the school fees. In two 
of the parochial schools, and in one of those taught by the latter 
mentioned individuals, Latin, Enghsh, writing, arithmetic, and 
book-keeping, are taught; and the fees exacted are from Is. 6d. 
to 2s. 6d. the quarter, according to the branches taught, in the 
other schools the same education is afforded, with the exception 
of Latin. In the schools supported by the Society, great attention 
is paid to the teaching of the Gaehc language; and m the other 
schools, it is taught to those who wish to acqmre it. The total 
amount of fees actually paid to the three parochial schoolmasters 

is about L. 50 per annum. n i 

During six months of the year all these schools are veH attend- 
ed From the 1st of November 1833 to the beginning of May fol- 
lowing, there were 552 children attending at these different schools; 
but in the summer months the number is diminished by one-halt. 
The people in general are so much alive to the benefits of educa- 
tion, that, in the course of a few years, it is supposed there will be 
few or no individuals between the ages of seven and twenty unable 

to read the Bible. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.-The average number of persons

receiving parochial aid amounts to 60, among whom is divided in 
different proportions from L. 25 to L, 30, arising from the collec- 
tions made in the churches on Sundays, and the interest of L. 160 
of mortifications. 

Inns. — At Drumnadrochit and Invermoriston are two excellent 
uins ; and at Ruisky is a public-house where travellers can bait 
their horses, and, if required, get a boat across Loch Ness to see 
the Fall of Foyers, or the wild but beautiful scenery at Inverfar- 
rikaig.

<p>
PRESBYTERY OF ABERTARFF, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. WILLIAM FRASER, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Th E period is not very far distant when these two parishes were 
united; but the writer cannot at present ascertain the exact date 
of their union. Abertarff and Glenmoriston had been previously 
joined together The junction of the former with Boleskine has 
been injudicious,— there being a hill seven miles long interven- 
ing between the inhabited districts of the two parishes, and the 
greater part of the intervening space being, from its height, fre- 
quently impassable in winter. 

_ Names.— In Abertarff, there are two rivers or rivulets which fall 
into Loch Ness within a very few yards of each other, called the 
Oich and the Tarff,— the former a considerable stream arisina- from 
two pretty large lakes,— the latter, except when swollen by'occa- 
sional mountam torrents, or the dissolution of the winter snow, only 
a brook, though it gives name to the district of Abertarff. 

« The parish of Boleskine is so termed," says the writer of the 
lormer Account, « from a farm contiguous to the Fall of Foyers 
called Batl-os-cionn, which signifies in Gaelic, the town hanging 
above the loch," Loch Ness. The name appears rather to be 
compounded of these three words, « Boile-eas-ceann," " ceani" 
signifying height, summit, " eas" a cataract, and 'boile" fury, rage, 



52 



INVRRNRSS-SI-IIRE. 



madness. Hence Boleskine appears to signify the summit of the 
furious cascade. The cascade here in view is now extensively 
known under the name of the Fall of Foyers. 

Extent, Boundaries.— The united parish from the N. E. to the 
S. W. following the course of the Military Road, measures 21 
miles. It is of unequal breadth, being partly indented by Loch 
Ness; but the average breadth may be stated at 10 miles. On 
the south it is bounded by the parish of Laggan ; on the W. S. W. 
by Kilmanivaig ; on the north by Urquhart ; on the N. E. by Do- 
res ; and on the east by Daviot. There is one farm in the dis- 
trict of Boleskine which is completely detached from the rest of the 
parish, and is surrounded by the parishes of Daviot and Dores ; 
and in like manner there is another farm locally situated withm 
the parish, but which belongs to Dores. 

Topographical appearances.~T\\Q parish of Boleskine embraces 
a portion of the country called Strath-herric, composed of flat lands 
interspersed with some undulating banks. Adjoining to ttie 
strath there is a great extent of high hill ground, Corry-yearrig ; 
over which the old mihtary line of road passes from Fort- Augustus 
to the south ; and adjoining it to the east, a range of equally high 
hills called Monadhliath. 

There is a considerable extent of low and flat lands in the pa- 
rish, favourable in good seasons for the growth of oats, barley and 
potato crops. 

CZmafe.— Boleskine is often parched during the summer months, 
while Abertarff is favoured with fostering dews and gentle rams. 
The clouds which swiftly fly along the high hills on each side of 
Loch Ness carrying rain in their bosom to other quarters, disap- 
point the anxious wishes and hopes of Boleskine, day after day, 
and are to it literally clouds without rain. 

The prevaiUng winds are the W. S. and S. W.,— which, from 
the adjacent elevated hills, acquire irresistible force, and sometimes 
overthrow houses, and spread havoc among the woods. 

The climate of Boleskine is, on the whole, severe,— owmg to the 
great number of lakes, to the elevation of the parish above the level 
of the sea, and to its lofty and extensive chain of hills. The ri- 
gorous climate, induces rheumatism and pulmonary complaints ; 
and the spare diet on potatoes, particularly if coupled with a habit 
of tippling, is thought to occasion the frequent occurrence of dropsy. 
These are the prevalent distempers of the parish. 
Hydrography.— There are at least a dozen lakes in the parish,- 



BOLESKINE AND AUERTARFF. 



53 



exclusive of Loch Ness, which is 24 miles long, and averages li in 
breadth. The depth of Loch Ness in the middle is from 106 to 
130 fathoms, and towards the sides from 65 to 75. From its great 
depth it never freezes. On both sides of Loch Ness, the ground 
rises to a considerable altitude, and is adorned with ash, oak, fir, and 
birch. The scenery of this and the other lakes, all of which pay tri- 
bute to Loch Ness, is wild and romantic. — The rivers in this parish 
are mconsiderable in point of number, extent, and magnitude; but 
they are frequently much enlarged by the autumnal rains and the 
thawing of the snow in spring. They all fall into Loch Ness. 

Fall of Foyers. — There are two remarkable cascades in the pa- 
rish formed by the same river within less than half a mile from one 
another, and known by the name of the Fall of Foyers. Directly 
m front of the upper one, there is a bridge of one arch thrown across 
the river, from which travellers can view it in perfect security. A 
httle above the cascade, the river is very much contracted between 
two rocks ; and previous to the erection of the bridge, a log was 
thrown over this chasm, reaching from one rock to the other, and 
servmg as a bridge to the'more courageous foot-passengers.  Many 
other views, all of them very interesting, may be had of this fall. 
Ascending a narrow rugged path on the west side of the river, about 
200 feet, to a level eminence, where there are a few dwarfish trees, 
and looking thence southwards,— the visitor will see to advantage 
the arch, the cascade, and the abyss below, where the current forces 
its way over piles of stones and fragments of rocks; and about a quar- 
ter of a mile to the south on the high road leading to Fort- Augus- 
tus there is a charming view of the bridge seen through the branches 
of the pendant trees. 

Advancing from the less to the greater fall, the prospect oradu- 
ally Hitreases in interest. The large stones in the channel of the 
river over which the waters roll and foam,— the weeping birch lin- 
ing the precipitous banTcsat irregular distances— the projecting mis- 
shapen rocks overhanging the tremendous gulf, and the impetuous 
torrent below— form a scene that cannot be beheld without admira- 
tion and awe. There are different positions from which the prin- 
cipal fall may be viewed to great advantage. One of the best h 
from the edge of the rock nearly opposite to it on the west side of 
the river ; but it is believed that strangers are seldom directed to

this spot. The favourite view is from what is called " the green 
point," which fronts the body. of the water in its descent; it is a 
thin rock projecting forward beyond the common bank, covered 
with a green sward, almost always saturated by the spray which 
ascends from the fall, and which, particularly when the wind blows 
from the north, rises some hundred feet high. The access to " the 
green point" has now been rendered easy and safe by a footpath 
made to it, within these few years, from the high road. 

Geology.— There is limestone of a good quality both in Bole- 
skine and Abertarflf; but it has never been wrought to any great ex- 
tent ; and now lime can be had at as cheap, if not a cheaper rate, 
from Sunderland, through the Caledonian Canal, than perhaps the 
native lime could be manufactured and sold at. This at least is true as 
regards AbertarfF, because almost all the tillable lands are nearly on 
a level with the canal. But it is otherwise with Boleskine, where 
the arable grounds, with the exception of the place of Foyers, is at 
the distance of some miles up hill all the way, from the nearest 
landing-place on the banks of Loch Ness,— which deters farmers 
from using imported lime as a manure ; whereas, were a person, of 
no great capital, but judicious and experienced, to obtain a lease 
of the lime rock, and to manufacture and sell it at the rate that 
the English lime can be purchased at, this invaluable article of 
manure would be brought within the reach of every farmer in the 
parish, and the poorest would avail himself of it. The soil would 
thereby be enriched, the harvest would be earlier and more produc- 
tive, and the climate, by means of additional planting, greatly me- 
liorated. 

The whole of the Boleskine district may be said to be nearly one 
continued rock of granite, both blue and red, but chiefly the former. 
There is a well in Abertarff, slightly impregnated with iron-ore. 
The soil, which is from six to ten or twelve inches deep, is not, on 
the whole, bad ; but is various, partaking of gravel, clay, till, loam, 
and peat moss. If left but a few years, it is commonly overrun with 
heath. There is abundance of peat moss over a bed of compact 
gravel and clay. 

Zoology.— ki one period, the largest deer in Scotland were sup- 
posed to be in this parish, and the hill called Monadhliath, was 
their favourite haunt. This hill is covered almost all over with a 
species of fungus, or that apparently unproductive and useless plant 
called gray moss, which is the natural provision of the deer, with- 
out which thev cannot thrive. Clover is rich pasture for cattle; but

were the deer confined to it, or to verdant meadows, they would 
soon die amidst the luxurious abundance. 

There are still a good many deer in the parish ; but these grace- 
ful and noble animals, which enliven our lonely heaths, and adorn 
our barren mountains, are much degenerated and greatly reduced 
in number and size. They have given way to that homely and ti- 
mid but more profitable race which contributes so much to our 
daily food and raiment. The hart and the roe seek their food and 
shelter in the lower grounds amongst the woods. 

All the interior lakes abound in trout, both red and white, of an 
excellent quahty; and some years ago salmon was plentiful in Loch 
Ness, but since the Caledonian Canal has been opened they have 
very much decreased. The diminution is partly attributed to steam 
navigation, but chiefly to the fry missing their proper course to the 
sea. Instead of coming down the River Oich, as of old, they de- 
scend by the canal ; and, its water being smooth, myriads of them 
fall a prey to the voracious pike, and most of those which escape 
this foe perish in getting through the locks. 

Botany.— Osks, ash, fir, and birch are the sorts of timber most 
congenial to the soil of this parish. There is only one tree in it 
known to the writer, remarkable for age, size, or form. It is of that 
species which, before the invention of artillery, when the issue of 
battle greatly depended on the bow and arrow, was in so much 
request. It is a yew growing on the farm of Foirbeg, on the banks 
of Loch Ness. It is now noticed, however, not on account of its 
magnitude, for it measures in circumference at the bottom only 14 
feet, and in height 33 feet 6 inches ; but for its antiquity. It has 
stood for time immemorial. Tradition itself is silent as to its age. 
Its branches are not so extended and luxuriant as might be expect- 
ed, because all its visitors, native and strangers, have been strip 
ping it of these ornaments. 

11. — Civil History. 

Land-Oioners.—The chief land-owners are, Mr Fraser of Lo- 
vat, Mr Fraser of Foyers, and Mr Fraser of Abertarff. 

Parochial Registers.— In regard to the parochial registers, it 
maybe observed, that in AbertarflF, a separate, partial, and incom- 
plete register of baptisms has been kept since January 1737, and 
of marriages from November 1739, under the management of the 
successive resident missionary ministers at Fort- Augustus. The 
present incumbent had at first followed the same plan, and for se- 
veral years the registers were correctly kept; but subsequently, on

the appointment of another missionary, to whose charge they were 
given, they were totally neglected for a period of ten years. It 
is said that, during the long incumbency of the Rev. Thomas Era- 
ser, a register of the births and marriages had been kept, but that 
the person to whom it was entrusted lost it in the act of passing a 
rapid stream. There is no register of the Boleskine district pre- 
vious to the year 1798. There are now two distinct ones, kept for 
both Abertarff and Boleskine, which are regularly transmitted 
about the first of January, every year, to the incumbent ; and their 
entries transcribed under his immediate superintendence, according 
to their respective dates, into one volume. 

Antiquities. — In the vernacular language of the county, the pre- 
sent glebe is called " Druim -a-dhampuil," signifying Temple 
Ridge, it being a ridge on which were the ruins of several Druidical 
temples of a circular form, the greatest number of which have been 
removed by the present incumbent, as they were generally placed 
in the centre of the fields, and interrupted the operation of the 
plough. There are still some left to exercise pa- 
tience of his successor. 

There is a farm in Boleskine called " Tom-a-bhoid," and ano- 
ther of the same name in Abertarff, derived from " Tom" a green 
eminence, which describes the local position of both, and " mod" 
an assembly or court,— the term being still applied to an assembly 
of persons qualified to administer justice. Each of these farms 
overlooks the rest of the country. 

In the Great Glen of Scotland, through which the Caledonian Ca- 
nal passes, are to be seen the remains, at various distances, of seve- 
ral vitrified forts ;— Qf which there is one, on the west, on the 
farm of Auchteran in Abertarff, and another on the eastern boundary 
of Boleskine, but properly speaking in the parish of Dores, which 
is there separated from Boleskine by a very small and contempti- 
ble rivulet. These towers or forts are every where called by the 
same appellation, namely, " Dungeardal," hterally signifying a pro- 
tecting eminence, or a guarded fortified hill. They were compact- 
ed or cemented in a manner more firm, indissoluble, and inde- 
structible than any modern building, notwithstanding the vaunted 
improvements made in architecture. 

Across the hill of Suidh-Chuiman is the great Military Road 
from Inverness to Fort- Augustus; and on its very summit, withm 
two yards of the road, there is a small cairn, such as is commonly

Ibund where persons have perished from the inclemency of 1;lie wea- 
ther, or died suddenly. It is said that, on this spot, one of the 
chieftains of the clan Cummin, so powerful in their day, while on 
the way to visit some of his dependents, fell sick and died. 

Modern Buildings. — The only buildings in the parish meriting 
the slightest notice are those of the garrison of Fort- Augustus. The 
ground on which this fort is built, and the farm connected with it, 
were originally part of the Lovat estate, but were appropriated by 
Government, in the year 1729, for the purpose of erecting a fortifi- 
cation to overawe some clans who were inclined to disturb the peace 
of the country, and to restore the forfeited and exiled family of 
Stewart. The garrison is now become unnecessary and useless ; 
and Government some years ago ordered the ramparts to be dis- 
mantled,_and the ordnance to be sent to Fort- George.

The cause of the late decrease of the population may be partly, 
emigration to America, — which has been occasioned by the intro- 
duction of the sheep-farming system. 

There are no towns in the parish, and only two small villages, 
Cill Chuiman, including the garrison, inhabited by 216 souls; 
and Balfrishel by 159.

come more generally known within the last three-and-thirty years. 
Within the last few years a striking improvement has taken place 
in the dress of the peasantry. About fifteen years ago, some va- 
grant preachers began to make their appearance in the parish. 
Elated with their supposed attaimnents in heavenly knowledge and 
grace, they undervalued the ministrations of the established pastor, 
and endeavoured to mislead the people.  

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There is no undivided common in the parish ; but, 
as there are few enclosures, there are frequent trespasses by cattle 
and sheep, throughout the winter and spring. 

The trees indigenous to the parish are the oak, fir, ash, birch, 
mountain-ash, poplar. There is hazel, but it is never allowed to 
come to any beneficial size. 

Rent of Land. — The annual rent of sheep grass is from 2s. 6d. 
to 3s. per acre, which is by far too high, considering the price of the 
product for some years past. KilHn is the most valuable grazing; 
and if the limits 'of this account permitted, the writer would be 
tempted to essay a description of this charming dell. 

Rate of Wages. — The demand for labour beyond what the year- 
ly hired servants perform, is of rare occurrence. Where there is oc- 
casion for additional hands for ordinary work, the rate is from 9d. 
to Is. per day, with victuals; reapers get Is. ; mowers Is. 6d.; ma- 
sons, 2s. with provisions. 

Husbandry. — From the nature of the land, husbandry is prac- 
tised in a very limited degree ; but, as far as circumstances permit, 
it is conducted as in the low country. The mountain torrents fre- 
quently encroach on the arable ground, and commit great injury ; 
for unfortunately no embankments have been made to ward off the 
damage. 

A few respectable tenants have commodious and well-construct- 

 A tradition, illustrative of the superstitions of the county, has been handed down 
from one generation to another, — that one of those persons favoured with the superna- 
tural gift of conveying the milk of their neighbours' cattle to their own, a native of 
Strathherric, had gone to the adjoining country of Badenoch, with the view of practising 
his art in favour of his own country generally, and succeeded so fai- as to be able to con- 
fine the Badenoch milk in a withe, which he carried across the hill of Monadhliath to 
the height of Killin, where it burst in virtue, perhaps, of a counter spell by the be- 
reaved country,and overflowed that delightful plain, — which has been the cause of the 
richness of its pastxn-e, and of the superior quality and quantity of milk it jroduees. 
The good effects of this untoward accident were not circumscribed to the dell of Kil- 
lin, for some of its streamlets kindly glided down to Strathherric, which accounts 
for the reputation, and deserved reputation, of the excellence of the milk, cream, and 
butter in that district.

ed farm buildings, and their arable ground partially enclosed ; bu t 
in general there are not many enclosures in the parish. 

No improvements deserving notice have recently been made • 
nor does the mountainous nature of the country admit of extended 
melioration, otherwise than by planting, which would interfere with 
the pasture of the sheep, and consequently reduce the current rents, 
— though at the distance of eighty years hence these would be 
considerably augmented. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — There are upwards of 30,000 sheep in the 
parish, almost all of the Cheviot breed. Though the carcase does 
not grow to a very extraordinary size, the wool is esteemed of 
superior quality, and has always fetched the highest price at mar- 
ket. Most of it is sold to woolstaplers in the north of England, and 
the wedders and sheep are generally purchased by south country 
storemasters, who frequent the great annual sheep and wool fair at 
Inverness ; but sometimes they are sent by the breeders to the Fal- 
kirk September or October tryst, in expectation of getting a bet- 
ter price than what they had previously been offered in the country. 
If disappointed, they must dispose of them at a reduced price, or win- 
ter them in the south, which increases the expense, and eventually 
diminishes the gain, or drive them to England, which places them 
still more at the mercy of the buyer. 

The parish being better calculated for sheep than for any other 
stock, there is comparatively little attention paid to the rearing of 
other stock. A few gentlemen, however, are careful in procuring the 
breed of genuine Highland cattle, and there is of late years an evi- 
dent disposition to improve the race of horses, by crossing the na- 
tive breed with the south country draught horse. 

Goats would prosper here, but would not remunerate ; and sheep- 
farmers are universally hostile to a mixed stock. 

Fisheries. — There is only one small salmon fishery in the parish, 
which rents at L. 30 a-year. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, ... L, 2262 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Inverness, distant twenty-one miles from the manse, is the nearest 
town to the parish. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office at Fort-Au- 



60 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



gustus, to which there is a post from Fort- WilUam thrice in the 
week, and a daily one from Inverness, which travels ahernate days 
by the south and north side of Loch Ness, and passes within a mile 
of the manse. 

At present, there are no turnpike roads but the old Military road. 
It runs through the parish on the south side for' about twenty-two 
miles ; it is under the management of the Parlimentary Commis- 
sioners for Highland roads and bridges, and is kept in good re- 
pair. The county have lately come to the resolution of placing toll- 
bars on this road ; but it is not supposed that the proceeds will suffice 
to defray the necessary expense of erecting the bars, &amp;c. With this 
road a branch of one of the Parliamentary roads on the west side of 
the parish unites at Fort- Augustus. A branch of a county dis- 
trict road, extending about three miles, commencing at the east 
boundary of the parish, passes by the manse, and joins the main 
road half a mile to the west of it. There are other two district roads 
across the country : these are not kept in such good repair. 

With one exception, the bridges on the great lines of road on 
both sides of the lake are kept in good condition. There has been, 
time immemorial, a wooden bridge on the river TarfF, close to the 
walls of Fort- Augustus, kept in constant repair and rebuilt when 
requisite by government ; but a few years ago, it was greatly dama- 
ged, and is now in a most ruinous state, so that it has become ha- 
zardous even to foot-passengers. 

The Caledonian Canal runs through the parish. When the ca - 
nal was opened, a certain rate was paid by every vessel navigating it, ac- 
cording to its tonnage. A good many vessels then frequented it. The 
rate was soon doubled, and fewer ships resorted to it. The commis- 
sioners, finding that while they grasped the shadow, the substance 
slipped through their fingers, reverted to the original rate; but this 
has not yet restored the shipping. It affords means of communica- 
tion by steam packets and other vessels ; but it is not likely ever to 
increase the national revenue, nor to improve the bordering districts, 
which, except a few specks here and there, are mountainous and in- 
capable of cultivation. The commissioners' 27th Report, states 
the total sum received in the previous year from tonnage rates at 
L. 2144, 17s. lid.; and a sum of L. 169, 19s. 7d. arising from mis- 
cellaneous sources, increases the amount of receipts to L. 2314, 
17s. 6d. The expenditure was L.3635, 9s. 3d., leaving a balance 
against the canal of L. 1320, lis. 9d. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is inconveniently situated 

4 



BOLESKINE AND ABERTARFF, 



61 



for the bulk of the inliabitants; it is distant from the eastern extre- 
mity scarcely two miles; but from the western extremity, in which 
the population is more than double, it is sixteen miles. It was 
built in 1777, and is at present in good repair, though uncomfort- 
able both for preacher and hearers, — being long and narrow, and 
resembling a barn more than a house meant for public worship. 
The walls and roof are bare, and only one-half of it has galleries. 
During the writer's incumbency, L. 570 have been bequeathed 
by four persons of the name Fraser ; and L. 70 more have been 
realized from fines recovered from delinquents. The interest of 
these sums is disbursed among the poor of Boleskine, to whom it is 
limited ; and the interest of L. 20 is divided among the Protestant 
poor of AbertarfF. 

The parish church affords accommodation to 428 persons, and 
the one at Fort- Augustus to about 300. There is no rent paid for 
seats in the parish church ; but at Fort- Augustus there are a few 
seats belonging to the kirk-session, which are let for behoof of the 
poor. The galleries are understood to be Government property, 
and the rest belongs to private individuals. 

The manse was built in 1773, and, from its exposed situation, 
requires to be frequently repaired. The last repairs given to it were 
two years ago. It is incommodious and extremely uncomfortable. 

The extent of the glebe is 52 acres, 2 roods, 10 falls; but of 
these upwards of 20 acres are rocks, stones, and worthless moor ; 
and the incumbent derives very little benefit from the residue, which 
is not properly enclosed, and is surrounded by tenants whose cat- 
tle and sheep constantly trespass and destroy the crop. 

As stated in the old Statistical Account, there were, till about 
sixty years ago, two glebes in the united parishes,— one near Fort- 
Augustus, on the banks of the TarfF, forming chiefly a level plot 
of ground without a stone or any impediment to interrupt a plough- 
and the other on the banks of Loch Ness, at the place peculiariy 
styled Boleskine, of easy tillage, and having some valuable wood of 
spontaneous growth in the hollow of some brooks. But an exchange 
was recommended, and effected, though not regularly, formally, 
or legally completed, if the record states the transaction correct- 
ly ; by this exchange, the legal guardians of the rights of the church 
sacrificed the comfort and interest of every succeeding incumbent; 
for the exchange has been from a charming spot and salubrious air, 
to heathy, stony, rocky ground— to an elevated position exposed

to every blast that blows, without a tree to shelter, or a shrub to 
variegate the dreary inhospitable place. 

The amount of stipend, by decree of the Court of Teinds, is six- 
teen chalders of victual, half barley and half oatmeal ; but as yet 
it is uncertain whether there are teinds in this parish to make this 
amount good. 

There is a missionary clergyman at Fort- Augustus, who is sup- 
ported from the Royal Bounty granted for the Reformation of the 
Highlands and Islands. There is a very snug, comfortable church 
there, originally built and kept in repair by voluntary subscrip- 
tion, to which Government a few years ago liberally contributed. 

There is a Popish meeting-house on the farthest farm west in 
the parish, adjoining Glengarry. 

The number of Papists in the parish is 318. What proportion 
of these attend their meeting-house, the writer does not know. 
There are no Dissenters or Seceders. 

In good weather, divine service at the Established church is ge- 
nerally pretty well attended. The average number of communi- 
cants used to be about 280 ; but in 1831 there are not so many. 

Education. — There are one parochial school and three other 
schools in the parish. In the parochial school, and in one of the 
other schools, the branches taught are, Enghsh and Gaelic read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, Latin, and sometimes book-keeping. 
In the two other schools are taught English reading, and arith- 
metic. The salary of the parish school is L, 30; garden allow- 
ance about L. 2, 2s. ; school fees L. 12. The emoluments of the 
other teachers consist entirely of school fees, and are both very 
small and precarious. The parochial teacher thinks he has not 
the legal accommodation. The expense of reading is 8s. in the 
year; reading and writing, 10s.; all other branches, 12s. The 
number of the young betwixt six and fifteen years of age who can- 
not read is 157. The number of persons upwards of fifteen years 
of age who cannot read is 451; of those who can read but cannot 
write, 235. The people in general have very inadequate notions 
of education, and do not continue their children at school long 
enough for their making any valuable progress. 

In a parish where the population is thin and scattered over so 
large an extent, there must be some so distant from school as to 
be unable to attend, particularly in winter, when, being least occu- 
pied with their vocations, they are most disposed to attend. 

One school at Fort- Augustus, with an efficient teacher, having a 



KINGUSSIE. 03 

suitable salary, would be of incalculable benefit; but the people are 
universally poor. Two other schools would be useful. 

There is another school in the parish with a salary of L. 7 
for female children, who are taught English reading, writing, and 
sewing, on the establishment of the Society in Scotland for Propa- 
gating Christian Knowledge. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving aid from the funds under the management of the kirk- 
session is 41 ; and the average sum annually allotted to each is 
about 20s. Instead of being disinclined, they solicit to be receiv- 
ed on the poors roll, notwithstanding of the small pittance in the 
power of the distributors to bestow. The parish is not assessed 
for their maintenance, — so that they depend on casual and volun- 
tary charity, eked out by the produce of a plot of potato ground, 
given to every one of them. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs held annually at Fort- Augustus, in 
the beginning of June and end of September, for the sale of cattle 
chiefly. Pedlars and shoemakers from various quarters attend to 
dispose of their merchandise. There are besides occasional trysts, 
in spring and autumn, for black-cattle.

THE REV. GEORGE SHEPHERD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name.—Ceannghiubhsaiche, the Celtic term for Kingussie, ap- 
pears to have been adopted as the name of the parish, from its beino- 
so descriptive of the site of the parish church. It signifies the " Tei 
mination or Head of the Fir Wood." When the name was given, 
the church stood upon a plain at the eastern extremity of a clump 
of wood, forming part of an immense forest of fir, which then co- 
vered the face of the country. 

Extent, Sfc.—lnMing hill and dale, the parish extends from 
east to west a distance of about 21 miles, and from north to south

about 18; but from the extreme irregularity of its surface and figure, 
it is difficult to specify its precise extent in square miles. It is 
situated in the Lordship of Badenoch, and must undoubtedly 
rank among the most elevated and the most inland parishes in 
Scotland. The bed of the Spey is reckoned about 850 feet above 
the level of the sea. The parish is bounded on tTie east by Alvie; 
on the north by the united parishes of Moy and Delarossie ; on the 
west by Laggan ; and on the south by Blair in AthoU. Within the 
parish, the Monadhliadh  mountains stretch along the boundary 
for a considerable way, serving as a northern frontier, while the 
Grampians, rising in bold perspective in the distance, bound the 
parish to the south. 

Topographical Appearances. — Both these ranges are generally 
elevated, but contain no individual hills of sufficient altitude to me- 
rit particular notice. From the Monadhliadh and Grampian hills, 
the descent is pretty gradual, and terminates in an extensive valley 
of arable meadow land, intersected by the Spey, which, with the 
narrow stripes along the various tributaries of that river, and the 
rising grounds to the south and north of it, forms most of the cul- 
tivated land of the parish, — the remainder consisting principally of 
bleak hills, covered chiefly with heath, and fitted only for pasturage. 

Meteorology. — The following results of a thermometrical regis- 
ter kept at Belleville in the neighbourhood, in 1821, has been hand- 
ed to me, by Sir David Brewster: Belleville, latitude, 57.5"; 
longitude, 47. W ; annual mean temperature of the air, 44.3 ; mean 
temperature of the winter, 36.1; spring, 41.2; summer, 53.68; 
mean temperature in harvest, 46.67 ; mean temperature for month 
of October, 47.52. 

The prevaiUng winds in the parish are the west and north-east, 
the former geierally accompanied with rain, and the latter with in- 
tense cold. In consequence of the great elevation of the parish, 
and its distance from the sea, the climate is cold and changeable, 
and subject, in the beginning and close of the season, to hea7 dews 
and frost. These, although of late years much less frequent and 
less severe, still prove sometimes very injurious to the crops, espe- 
cially to potatoes, — an article of food upon which the peasantry in a 
great measure depend for subsistence. From the numerous marshes 
which at one time covered the low grounds, there arose an immense 
quantity of vapour, which, upon a depression of temperature, fell 
in the form of dew and frost upon the surrounding fields, carrying

certain ruin along with them. By the improvements in agriculture, 
however, 'these noxious influences have been to a great degree re- 
moved. The wet swampy lands have now nearly all given place 
to dry cultivated fields,— a circumstance which has benefited the 
country in regard at once to temperature, salubrity, and appearance. 
The prevailing distempers in the parish are inflammation, dropsy, 
apoplexy, and rheumatism. These are to be ascribed chiefly to the 
nature of the food upon which the peasantry in general subsist, and 
to the variableness and rigour of the climate. 

Hydrography.— kXthough. the parish contains several lakes, 
scarcely any of them merit particular notice. Loch Errochd is 
a fine sheet of water, generally reckoned about sixteen miles 
long, but of these only about six lie within the boundaries of 
Kingussie. Throughout the greater part of this extent, the sce- 
nery is rather tame and bleak,— till towards the point where the 
parish terminates, when the banks assume a precipitous aspect, and" 
are slightly wooded. None of the other lakes exceed a mile and a- 
half in length, by three quarters of a mile in breadth; but, though 
small, they are by no means devoid of natural beauty. One of 
them. Loch Gynag, contains a small island, on which can be still 
traced the remains of what is said to have been a castle. The prin- 
cipal river is the Spey, which, as already noticed, intersects the pa- 
rish. After leaving Laggan, where it has its rise, it meanders from 
west to east in a series of beautiful curves, for upwards of seven 
miles, through a rich vale slightly wooded with natural birch and 
alder. Its average velocity in this parish may be about three miles 
an hour. Its depth varies from 2 to 16 feet ; its width may be on 
an average, from 80 to 100 feet. The other rivers in the parish 
are the Truim, which, for a considerable distance, forms its western 
boundary; the Tromie, which serves to divide it from Insh, on the 
east both running in a northerly direction ; the Gynag and the 
Calder, which flow to the south; all of these are tributary to the 
bpey. Most of them have their sources within the parish, and vary 
in length from 5 to 11 miles. The Spey, after a course of nearly 
100 miles, discharges itself into the Moray Firth, 

The soil in the meadows, and along the banks of the several 
streams, consists in general of three strata. The upper of these 
IS alluvial, and composed of a sort of sandy slime, covering a light 
loam which forms the second,-andthis last generally incumbent on 
a bed of clay. The higher grounds are for the most part of a loamy 
nature, and generally intermixed with sand. The meadow grounds 

INVERNESS. j; ° 



66 INVERNESS-SHIRE, 

are of great extent, stretching along the Spey for its whole length 
in the parish, and extending on both sides of the, river, in some 
places to three-quarters of a mile in breadth. They are likewise 
very deep and fertile, measuring in many places from 10 to 12 feet, 
and yield natural grass in great abundance, and in general of a fine 
quality. Many years ago, a mine of silver was discovered at a 
little distance from the church, but was never turned to any ac- 
count. Some specimens also of silver and lead ores, have been 
found in the river Gynag before referred to, but in very small quan- 
tities. 

Zoology. — In common with the rest of the district, this parish 
was at one time much infested with wild bears and wolves ; but 
these have long since disappeared, and none of the rarer kinds of 
animals are now to be found. The fishes caught in the rivers and 
lakes are, trout, pike, and salmon ;— the two first of which are 
pretty plentiful. Char appear in the Spey for about a fortnight 
in the month of October. Salmon come up to spawn about the 
end of August, and return towards the end of October, or begin- 
ning of November. Pike spawn in March ; and trout continue 
out in the small brooks, to which they go for the purpose of spawn- 
ing towards the end of September, till compelled to return by hard 
frost. The fresh-water mussel, containing pearls, is fished up m 
considerable quantities from the Spey. 

The forest of Gaick, the only one in the parish, abounds in 
deer, and is much frequented by sportsmen. It contains no wood, 
with the exception of here and there a few birch trees; but the 
scenery is very wild and romantic. The plantations, of which there 
are several in the parish, of greater or less extent, consist chiefly 
of common fir and larch, interspersed with mountain-ash and oak. 
For these the soil seems well fitted; but the species of wood to 
which it appears most congenial are, alder, hazel, and birch, which 
are found growing naturally in many parts of the parish. The 
most plentiful of these is birch, which covers extensively the rising 
grounds upon the southern bank of the Spey. 

II. — Civil History. 
Family of the Comym.—T\\e whole district of Badenoch, of 
which Kingussie is the central parish, was originally the property 
of the Comyns, who were at -an early period of Scottish history 
one of the most wealthy and influential families in the kingdom. 
It is matter of doubt, at what time, and in what manner, this family, 
who came from England during the time of David L, acquired pos-

session of it; but we find John Comyn first noticed as Lord of Ba- 
denoch as early as the reign of Alexander III. This nobleman, 
who was related to some of the former kings, laid claim to the crown 
upon the death of Margaret in 1291, but soon after withdrew his 
pretensions. Being the superior lord of Scotland, he was summon- 
ed by Edward I. to serve in his wars in Gascony. He was suc- 
ceeded in his title and estates by his son, John, who was a brave 
and patriotic nobleman, and chosen one of the guardians of Scot- 
land about the year 1299. From this period down to the year 
1305, we meet with incidental notices of this heroic character in 
his relation to Badenoch; but the principal scenes of his hfe lav 
in the south. In 1302, with the assistance of another warrior he 
successfully repelled the English forces near Roslinjf and 'two 
years thereafter, he made a last fruitless struggle for Scottish in- 
dependence at Stirling; but was obliged to yield, along with his 
country, to the overwhelming power of Edward I. J In the sue 
ceeding year, he fell a victim to the relentless fury of Bruce after 
wards King, for having discovered to Edward the designs 'of the 
former upon the crown of Scotland. For about nine years after 
Comyn s death, we find no mention of a successor to his lands or 

n 1 'sntr '"i"" "'" -"dd the throne 

m 1306, he so weakened the influence, and reduced the numbers 
of the family of Comyn, that the name became almost extinct in 
the kingdom. In all probability, Badenoch, upon the murder of 
Its original owner, was taken possession of by Bruce, as we find it 
noticed among the lands belonging to him in Moray, which he 
erected into an earldom about the year 1314, and bestowed 
upon h.s nephew, Thomas Randolph, under the title of E l of 
Moray § In the hands of this nobleman, and his succeo i 
seems to have contmued till the year 1371, or thereabout 
I became the property of the family of Stuart, which was nla,v ' 
allied to that of Bruce. Robert II., the grandso; of Roblt Bru 1

reared by the Comyns, on a green conical mound on the southern 
bank of the Spey, in this parish,— a situation chosen, no doubt, 
on account of its beauty and security, as well as for the exten- 
sive and delightful view which it commanded of the valley of the 
Spey. Here the Wolf, considering himself secure, and presum- 
ing upon his connection with the Crown, exercised a despotic sway 
over the inhabitants of his own immediate district, and spread terror 
and devastation everywhere around. His life was characterized 
throughout by the most cruel and savage conduct. It was he who, in 
1390 and the following year, from some personal resentment against 
the Bishop of Moray, set fire to the towns of Forres and Elgin, 
which, with the magnificent cathedral, canons' houses, and several 
other buildings connected with the latter, he burnt to ashes, carry- 
ing off at the same time all that was valuable in the sacred edifice. 
For this sacrilegious deed the Wolf suffered excommunication,— 
the effects of which he soon felt even in his den ; and having made 
what reparation he could to the see of Moray, he was subsequent- 
ly absolved, t The Wolf died not long after, in 1394, and was 
buried in the cathedral church of Dunkeld, where a Latin inscrip- 
tion was placed upon his tomb, t By the death of " Alastair mor 
mac an JRigK § which was a name sometimes applied to the Wolf, 
his possession fell to his natural son, Duncan, who seems to have 
inherited the vices as well as the property of his father. This is 
the last of the Stuarts connected with Badenoch of whom there is 
any account, written or traditional. The district some time after this 
period, passed into the hands of the first Earl of Huntly, who received 
part of it in 1452, for his valuable services to James H. m defeat- 
ing the Earl of Crawfurd at Brechin. The lands adjacent to the 
castle of Ruthven were given him at an earlier period ;|| and the 
principal part of the Lordship continued in the hands of the Gordon 
family, till of late years, when some of it has been disposed of. 

Land-owners.— The landholders of Kingussie at present are five 
in number : George Macpherson Grant of Ballmdalloch ; James 
Baillie, Esq. merchant in Bristol ; Mfss Macpherson of Belleville ; 
Cluny Macpherson ; and Colonel George Gordon of Invertromie.

Eminent Men.—The parish has produced, at several times, 
men who have distinguished themselves in the literary, but espe- 

has been related with great inaccuracy. Tlie statement we are about to submit is 
in substance the account given by an elder of the parish, who was an eyewitness 
ot most of what he relates, and whose story is corroborated by other old people in 
the district. Early on the morning of Monday the 1st or 2d of January 1800, a mi. 

litary gentleman, who resided in the parish. Captain M'P accompanied by four 

attendants, went out a deer-stalking among the wild and rugged mountains that skirt 
the parish to the south. The immediate intention of this expedition, it is said, was to 
kill some game tor a Christmas feast : and they took provisions with them sufficient to 
serve until the following Friday, on which day they had determined to return. They 
were to lodge in a house in the valley of Gaick, at that time unoccupied, but generally in 
the possesion of herdsmen, who used to tend their flocks upon the surrounding pas- 
tures. I his house was a very good and substcUitial building of stone, and probably 
mortar, with strong couples of wood, driven into the ground after the manner of some 
ot the houses of this country, which are constructed in this way for the purpose of 
greater stability. It stood on rather a rising ground, at the foot of one of those lofty 
mountains with which the valley is almost surrounded, fronting nearly the north-west 
and, .rom the pecubarity of its situation, combined with its strength, might have been 
thought secure from the utmost fury of a storm. The first two dys after Captain 
. — "' '" P'i'ty left home, were very calm and frosty. Towards Wednesday 

the'"Zh r'''- '""ri  '''"'' drifting snow from 

the south-east, whicli increased throughout the night to a hurricane. This continu 
unabated till the morning and forenoon of Friday, when it givadually settH down 
again into fine weather. As the house in which Captain M'P-_Z and his nany 

tm7he° T T f " "° '- entertained of the slightest danger' 
11 the circumstance of their non-appearance on Friday evening excited a suspicion 
that all could not be right. A messenger was accordingly despatched on Satu day 
morning to discover the cause of their delay, who, on coming near he place wSreJh 
house had stood, was surprised to find that it had quite disappeared, wh Llts site was 
covered with an immense depth of snow. This induced a Itrong dread that Captlfn 
. companions had all perished ; and the fact of his having found a 

th f ;• P'°P''y °f of the party, confirmed his fears. On communicatino-

cially in the military world. James Macpherson, Esq. the cele- 
brated translator of the poems of Ossian, and author of several 
orio-inal works in prose and verse, was a native of this parish. He 
was born in 1738, in the village of Ruthven, where he afterwards 
for some time taught the parish school. Mr Macpherson's lite- 
rary history is well known, and his talents as a writer universally 
acknowledged. His version of the bard of the Gael has acquired 
for him a high, extensive, and lasting fame. About the year 1790, 
he purchased a beautiful property lying chiefly in this, and partly 
in the neighbouring parish, to which he gave the name of Belle- 
ville. On this property he resided occasionally till the period of 
his death in 1796, when his remains were, at his own request, de- 
posited in the Poet's Corner of Westminster Abbey. His estates 
descended to his eldest son, who possessed them till he died in 
April 1833, when they fell to his elder sister, who now enjoys 
them. The natives of this parish, who have risen to high rank m 
the army, are so numerous, that it would be both tedious and use- 
less to particularize them. It has the honour of numbering among 
these, the late Lieutenant- General John Maclntyre of E. I.C._ S. 
and Sir John M'Lean, who is still alive,— the former born at Knap- 
pach, the latter at Pitmain, men who have eminently distinguished 
themselves in the service of their country. 

Parochial Bec/isters.— The parochial registers up to the year 1 724, 
were unfortunately burnt, so that the earliest entry of those exist- 
ing is dated at that period. The earlier parts of the records now 

of the calamity, led the common people in the country to refer it to some supernatu- 
ral agency, or at least to the shock of an earthquake or to l.ghtnmg But an avalanche, 
or fall of snow, seems to account for all the circumstances connected with it. i he im- 
mense bank of snow referred to as involving tlie building lay ,n a straight line from 
Se foot of a very steep part at the top of the hill, to very near a stream which mean- 
dered at its base The snow was very broad and deep throughout, but gradually de- 
creased in depth as it approached its termination below. Beyond the boundaries of 
this b-mk the snow was quite thin on all sides, and in a few days was comple ely gone. 
The ™bbi of thlhouse, as well as the body last found, all lay in the direction of the 

valley below ° the bodies of Captain M'P and another of the party, were m- 

Ilined in this direction also ; clearly indicating that the force which des royed them 
operted in the direction of line from the top of the hill to its base ; and it  known 
that the wind blew with terrific violence in this direction likewise, which would of 
course grltly augment the weight and force of the falling snow. The "otion of an 
:Xrbeing tlie cause of thead catastrophe, is further supported by the fact tha 
in the interval between the time of its occurrence and the discovery of the body last 
fot nd in the middle of spring, an immense body of snow fell from the same hill and 
rc ted immediately at the back of where the house had stood, and in a" Pab' i y 
wouTd have proceeded farther, had it not been stopped by the opposing force of the 
itWfell before, which was still very deep. Tliis lump measured '24 feet deep 
bvTe broad And everal years thereafler, a similar fall from a hill about a mile to 
7 h ul force sufRcient to break ice of a foot thick, which covered a small akc 

andt SLli the water of it to a considerable distance upon ,he opposite h.ll.

extant were regularly kept, and ai-e very voluminous. The later 
books have been also regularly preserved, but are neither large nor 
numerous, and contain few minutes of session of any great interest. 

Antiquities. — Among the antiquities of the parish, may be no-r 
ticed the remains of the barracks of Ruthven, which stand upon a 
conical mound, thought to be partly natural, partly artificial, upon 
the southern bank of the Spey, on the site of the old castle of 
Ruthven, the seat of the Lords of Badenoch. The present build- 
ing, which is now in a dilapidated state, began to be built by 
Government about the year 1718, for the purpose of keeping the 
country in subjection after the rebellion of 1715. It consisted of 
two parallel buildings of equal length, running nearly east and 
west, connected by two of much less height lying in a trans- 
verse direction, and forming a complete square, large enough, it 
IS said, to accommodate two companies of men. There was, be- 
sides, a pretty large house which served the purpose of a stable for 
a number of horses. The party who were stationed here joined 
Cope when on his march to Liverness in 1745, with the exception 
of a Serjeant and twelve men, who were left to defend the barracks 
in case of an attack by the rebels. In the following month, these 
few kingsmen gave a successful resistance to a body of 200 insur- 
gents. In February of the succeeding year, this small band 
sustained a severe attack from 300 rebels, headed by Gordon of 
Glenbucket, and, after a brave defence of three days, obtained 
an honourable capitulation. Not long thereafter, the insur- 
gents set fire to the building, and all that now remains of it is but 
a mouldering pile, fast sinking into decay. Ruthven of Badenoch 
IS known as well for its antiquity as its celebrity in history. It is 
one of the few places in the north mentioned by Ptolemy, in his 
Geographical Account of Britain, about the year 140. This an- 
cient Greek writer says, it is situated in the province of Moray 
and gives it the name of Ba.«.,«.— There are still to be seen in 
the parish the faint traces of a building said to have been a priory • 
but httle is known respecting it. There was also a monastery, of 
which no satisfactory account can be given. " The parish con- 
tains, likewise, some Druidical circles, and the appearance of a 
Koman encampment. This last is situated on a mobr between 
the Bridge of Spey and Pitmain. In clearing some ground adja- 
cent, an urn was found full of burnt ashes, which was carefully

preserved, and is still extant. A Roman tripod was also found 
some years ago, concealed in a rock, and is deposited in the same 
hands with the urn." Where the last two relics of antiquity 
now are, we have not discovered. 

III. — Population. 
The population, at least for a good many years back, has gra- 
dually increased. At the date of the last Statistical Account, it 
amounted to 1803, and at the successive Parliamentary surveys of 
1811, 1821, 1831, the respective results were, 1981, 2004, and 
2080 ; of the last of which numbers, 941 were males, and 1 139 
females. In 1833, however, the district of Insh, which previously 
formed part of this parish, was erected into a separate charge, 
quoad sacra, and, consequently, its population comes now to be de- 
ducted. This deduction leaves for Kingussie, by a survey com- 
pleted in October 1833, a population of 721 males, and 912 fe- 
males, total, 1633. The increase observable at the successive 
dates of census, greatly owing, no doubt, to the erection of vil- 
lages, which have attracted people from the neighbouring parishes, 
would probably have been much greater, were it not for emigra- 
tion, and the want of sufficient employment for the young of the 
working classes and for tradesmen, who are in consequence obliged 
to seek the means of a livelihood elsewhere, and chiefly in a fo- 
reign land. No fewer than eighty souls left the united parish in 
1833 for America. The inhabitants are distributed in the fol- 
lowing proportions : Residing in villages, 704 ; in the country, 929. 
The annual average of births for the last seven years is 47 ; of mar- 
riages, 13. No register of deaths is kept. 

Number of persons under ]5 years of age, 574

Total, - - 1633, as above. 

There are but few people of independent fortune amongst us. 
Each of the five landholders possesses property in the parish to a 
much greater amount than L. 50. The number of unmarried men, 
bachelors, and widowers, upwards, of fifty years of age is 25 ; and 
of unmarried women, upwards of forty-five, 62. As the census of 
1831 was taken before the disjunction of Insh from Kingussie, the 
following particulars, extracted from that census, must be given for 

 Old Statistical Account.

both as united : Number of famiUes, 481 ; average number of 
children in each family, probably about 4. Number of inhabited 
houses, 440; number uninhabited, 15; building, 10. There are 
1 fatuous and 1 blind person in the parish. The number of fami- 
lies chiefly employed in agriculture is 152 ; in trade, manufactures, 
or handicraft, 100. 

The language of the common people is Gaelic, but most of the 
young, and many of the old inhabitants understand English : among 
the better classes, the latteris preferred. The Gaelichas lost ground 
very much within the last forty years ; and it is highly probable the 
time is not very far distant when it will cease to be a living language 
in this part of the country. The dress of the people is assuming 
much of the lowland cast ; and the once characteristic garb is now 
seldom used, but on extraordinary occasions, or by young children. 
The common food of the peasantry consists of potatoes, and oat- 
meal in its various preparations, with now and then a little butcher- 
meat, cheese, and milk. 

Character, c. of the People. — It is true that the young of the 
poorer sort are now more inured to labour, and more willing to en- 
gage in it, than they once were, — and that the march of improve- 
ment in agriculture and knowledge has been accompanied with 
many advantages, — as in the erection of villages which have in- 
creased the facility of disposing of their httle country produce, and 
brought in return the necessaries, and some of the comforts, of Hfe 
to their doors. Still from the shortness of most of their- leases, — 
the non-residence of some of the proprietors, which drains the 
country of money, — the still uncertain state of their crops, and the 
length of land carriage, which is at least forty-six miles, the com- 
mon people continue in a very poor and uncomfortable state. 
They have many good qualities of character. The bravery of many 
of them has been well proved, and they maintain a high reputation 
for hospitality and poHteness. But these virtues are too often 
found in union with vices, by which their value is much impaired : 
and quarrelling, intemperance, and an artfulness of address, are 
still features in their character. We have, however, pleasure in 
adding, that these defects, especially the two first, are now less fre- 
quent, than when the last Account was written. The facilities now 
afforded for acquiring a good education, and consequently of read- 
mg and hearing the Scriptures read, are obviously producing, by 
the blessmg of God, a salutary impression ; religious principle is ac- 
quu-ing a greater sway over the conduct, and, while there is but too

much reason to complain of insincerity even in religious profession, 
and of mere formality in religious observances, there are still, com- 
paratively speaking, but few instances of open profanation, and of a 
marked contempt of the ordinances of religion. Smuggling, which 
at one time prevailed to a great extent, and tended more to demo- 
ralize the people than any thing ever introduced into the country, 
has been of late years entirely abandoned, and a sensible ameliora- 
tion in the morals of the inhabitants has in consequence taken place. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish, so far as known to the writer, not 
having at any time undergone a regular measurement, no statement 
to be relied upon can be given of the relative quantities of land, 
arable or uncultivated, or of the number of acres which may be un- 
der wood. It may be mentioned, however, that it must always be 
more a pastoral than an agricultural parish ; and, consequently, the 
land susceptible of regular culture is, comparatively speaking, but 
of limited extent. The greater part of it now consists of large 
sheep walks. The management of plantations, in respect of prun- 
ing and thinning, is pretty good ; and they are in a very thriving 
condition. 

Rent of Land. — Land rents at an average of from L. 1, 5s. to 
L. 1, 10s. per acre, so far as we can ascertain. 

Rate of Wages. — Day-labourers receive in summer Is. per day 
with, and Is. 6d. without, victuals ; and women 6d. or 9d., ac- 
cording as they supply themselves with food or not; when en- 
gaged at harvest work, they receive Is. per day, with victuals. 
Mason's work, at from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 6d., when hired by the day, 
and carpenters at 2s. Carpenter work, per yard of roofing or 
flooring, including materials, 3s. 6d., and per foot of windows, 
including glass, 2s. 6d. ; mason work, per rood, materials included, 
L. 6, 10s. or exclusive of materials, L. 2. Plasterers work. Is. 
6d. per yard ; slaters, L. 6 per rood, both including materials ; 
blacksmiths when hired by the day receive in general about 2s. 6d. 

Prices of Provisions. — Oatmeal on an average of seven years 
has sold for about 20s. the boll, of nine stones ; bear or big-meal, 
the same as oatmeal, with ten stones to the boll : beef, 5d. or 6d. 
per lb.; mutton, 6d. per ditto; cheese, 7s., and butter 18s., the 
stone of 24 lbs. 

Husbandry. — The sheep reared here are generally of the black- 
faced kind, with a very few Cheviots for family use; and the cattle 
consist chiefly of the Highland, with a few of the Ayrshire breed.

The system of agriculture followed by all the respectable tenantry 
is the modern one of cropping by rotation ; but the crofters and 
poorer tenants, partly from their aversion to the new scheme, and 
partly from their indigent circumstances, still pretty generally ad- 
here to the old plan. The villagers of Kingussie, however, form 
an exception to this remark. Some of the feuars in this village 
farm with great spirit and taste, according to the most approved 
system ; — in consequence of which, the lands in its vicinity have 
been brought to a state of high cultivation. The proprietors, we 
understand, are desirous to introduce the new mode of farming over 
all their estates, and some of them have taken their tenants bound, 
that, at the expiry of the leases lately granted, the farms shall all be 
put under a regular rotation. Of late years, much has been done 
in the way of reclaiming waste land, embanking and draining; and 
the improvements in this way are still proceeding. The general 
length of leases, when such are granted, is nine or ten years ; a 
number of the smaller tenants, however, hold their possessions from 
year to year, which is certainly unfavourable to improvement. The 
capabilities of the lower grounds are generally very great, and under 
the management of skilful and industrious tenants, with a mode- 
rate capital, and leases of sixteen or nineteen years, might, notwith- 
standing all disadvantages, be turned to excellent account. Some 
sheep-farmers have leases of fifteen years ; and one tenant holds 
his farm for nineteen years. The farm-buildings of the better 
classes are good, but those of the poorer sort are very indifferent. 
The enclosures consist chiefly of stone, and some of them of turf ,• 
those of the former kind are very substantial. 

The writer has not been able to obtain an accurate account of 
the amount and value of the raw produce yearly raised in the pa- 
rish. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Mea7is of Communication, Src. — The nearest market-town is In- 
verness, at a distance of forty-six miles. There are two villages 
in the parish, both of which are on the increase. Kingussie, the 
larger of these villages, contains a post-office, through which there 
is a regular communication, both with the south and north, thrice 
a-week. The great Highland road from Perth to Inverness pas- 
ses through the parish, extending in the directions of south and 
north, a distance of sixteen miles; upon which the Caledonian 
coach runs daily, either south or north, between the towns just 
mentioned. There are regular carriers once a-week from Kin- 



76 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



gussie to Inverness and Perth by this road also, — which in sum- 
mer is very much frequented by travellers, being the most direct 
communication between the northern Highland counties and the 
south of Scotland. It crosses the Spey four miles above the 
village of Kingussie, by a large bridge, which is in excellent 
repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church stands in the village of 
Iingussie, on a beautiful wooded eminence, about a mile and a-half 
from the eastern verge of the parish. Its situation is by no means 
centrical, — though, on the whole, convenient enough for the great 
body oT the population. Although built so late as the year 1792, 
it is now in such a state as to require a thorough repair and ad- 
dition : or rather perhaps a new one should be built. In its pre- 
sent form, it is by far too small for the population, affording ac- 
commodation only for between 600 and 700 persons. The church 
seats follow the farms upon the several estates, and the villagers pay 
for their seats to the tenantry who have any to spai'e. There is no 
manse in the parish, but an annual sum is allowed by the heritors 
in lieu of one. The glebe contains upwards of forty acres, and is very 
capable of being improved; and when the improvements which are 
now going on shall have been completed, it will be worth about L. 50 
per annum. The present incumbent has planted upwards of 3000 
young trees upon it, and got the whole enclosed. The stipend by 
a late augmentation is sixteen chalders, half meal, half barley, pay- 
able in money, with L. 10 for communion element money. There 
are no missionaries, no chapels of ease, and no Dissenting chapels 
of any kind, except a Baptist meeting-house ; and the Government 
church at Insh, formerly connected with this parish, has been late- 
ly converted into a parish church, and the charge, as already re- 
marked, rendered, quoad saci-a, separate and independent. There 
being no Dissenters of any kind, with the exception of a few Bap- 
tists, and one Roman Catholic family, there is in consequence a 
full attendance at the Established church. The average number 
of communicants is upwards of 200. 

Several years ago, a Bible and School Society was established 
by the parishes of Kingussie, and Insh, and Laggan ; the contri- 
butions of which are given to those religious institutions, which 
furnish Bibles at a cheap rate to the country, and aid in the esta- 
blishment of schools. To this society, the parish of Kingussie con- 
tributes at an average, from L. 22 to L. 23 per annum. There 



KINGUSSIE. 



77 



are besides, occasional collections in aid of the Northern Infir- 
mary. 

There is a catechist in the parish, with a salary of L. 20, one- 
half of which is paid by the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, and the other half by the present incumbent. 

Education. — In the parish, there are, the parochial school, — 
two seminaries supported by the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, one of which is a female school, — and one supported 
by the Glasgow Auxihary Society : and in the Insh district, one 
school supported by the General Assembly's Committee. There 
is also an infant school maintained by individual subscription. 
Besides these, there have been for some years past, two aid schools 
during the winter and spring months, in remote and necessitous 
parts of the parish, supported by the Inverness Education Society. 
The salary of the teacher of the infant school is L. 10, besides 
some perquisites ; and the branches taught are, English reading, 
writing, sewing, and knitting. Latin and mathematics are taught 
at the parochial school. 

The salary of the parish schoolmaster is the maximum : that of 
the teacher appointed by the General Assenably's Committee, 
L. 20 -; of the Society's teacher, L. 15 per annum. The parochial 
teacher is in the annual receipt of about L. 16 for school fees. 
The schoolmaster furnished by the Glasgow Auxiliary Society re- 
ceives L. 14 from that society, and L. 8 from the people of the 
district in which he teaches for school fees. The parochial school- 
master has the accommodation required by law ; and the heritors, 
in the most handsome manner, came forward some years ago, and 
erected a large and commodious school-house, far beyond the legal 
requirement. There is scarcely any part of the parish so distant 
as not to be within the reach of one or other of the schools we have 
mentioned ; and the people seem in general anxious for the benefits 
of education to their children, provided they can be obtaiined at a 
cheap rate. The number of young people betwixt six and fifteen 
years of age who cannot read or write amounts to about 39. The 
schools are obviously producing a very beneficial effect. 

Literature. — About four years ago, a Subscription Circulating 
Library was established in the village of Kingussie, and consists 
now of upwards of 300 volumes, comprising books in divinity, his- 
tory, and general literature. Besides this, there is a small library 
for the benefit of the scholars connected with the parish school, 



78 



INVEIINESS-SIIIRE. 



containing nearly seventy volumes, which are eagerly read, and found 
to be of great use to the rising generation. There is also a library 
connected with the General Assembly's school at Inverness. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of paupers 
in the parish is 60, — who receive aid from the funds according to 
their several necessities, from 2s. 6d. to L. 1 per annum. The amount 
reahzed annually for church collections may be about L. 27. The 
funds derived from the fines of delinquents are very variable. 
These sources of relief, along with common begging, are the only 
ones known here ; assessment for the support of the poor has never 
yet been resorted to in this country. In regard to the disposition 
manifested by those dependent upon parochial aid, it must be stated, 
that they are rather anxious to procure it than otherwise, and that 
the degradation seems to be fully compensated in their eyes, by 
the accession to their comforts which it confers. It ought, how- 
ever, to be remarked, that none but those who are reallv needful 
obtain any assistance. 

Prisons. — In 1806, a house was erected in the village of Kin- 
gussie, consisting of a neat court room, for holding the meetings of 
the district, and two cells for the confinement of offenders, where 
they are detained only till they can be conveyed to the county 
prison. These cells by a late repair have been rendered very se- 
cure ; they are kept by a jailor, who is accountable to the authori- 
ties of the district. We are not aware that there has been a single 
prisoner during the last year. 

Fairs. — There are commonly five or six markets in the parish 
throughout the year; the principal one of which is held in June 
for selling wool, lambs, &amp;c. Another is held in November for set- 
tling accounts, and engaging servants ; and a third in February. 
Other three are held for buying and selling cattle, at different 
times, so as to suit dealers passing from the southern and northern 
markets. 

Inns and Alehouses. — The parish contains two inns, and ten or 
eleven alehouses, — the effects of which, especially of the ale- 
houses, upon the morals of the people, are certainly of a perni- 
cious tendency. 

Fuel. — The common fuel used here is peat, procured, at a very 
great expense, from mosses in some places four and five miles dis- 
tant.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Witliin the last forty years, the parish has undergone many im- 
portant alterations in its physical as well as its moral character. 
Great part of the bleak and barren land, formerly supposed fit to 
be only the abode of wild beasts, has been brought under cultivation. 
Although the parish, as before noticed, must always be more a pas- 
toral than an agricultural one, and though the utmost extent of im- 
provable soil is and must always be far exceeded by the extent of 
mountain and other land incapable of cultivation, still were the 
part of the parish, which can be cultivated, to be brought under a 
system of regular rotation, it might be nearly, if not entirely 
adequate to the supply of the wants of the population, a good 
which has never yet been accomplished. Nothing has proved 
more ruinous to this parish than the necessity of bringing meal 
from other districts, with the additional expense of a long land- 
carriage. Since the date of the last Statistical Account, regular 
carriers have been established, and roads made in various direc- 
tions, by which intercourse can be carried on with ease between 
the several parts of the district, as also between this and the neigh- 
bouring countries ; indeed, there is now no district in the High- 
lands better accommodated with roads. The coach before -men- 
tioned as running through the parish, has been established, too, 
within the same period. Forty years ago, " there was not a vil- 
lage in the parish or in the whole district ;"  there are now two 
in this parish alone; of a combined population of upwards of 700. 
One of these villages contains thirteen or fourteen merchants, who 
deal in almost every necessary commodity, and there are several 
others throughout the parish ; circumstances which present a strik- 
ing difference from the state of things when there was but one or at 
most two merchants in the whole district. The village above mention- 
ed contains, besides, a number of mechanics and tradesmen. Near- 
ly half a century has witnessed a great change likewise in the in- 
habitants themselves. The melioration discernible in their moral 
character has been noticed. The Highland garb will soon entire- 
ly disappear. The Gaelic language, too, besides having materially 
lost ground, has suffered considerably from the intermixture with 
English words and phrases,— as the latter language is now gene- 
rally understood by the rising generation. But the difference 
between the state of matters now, and that which existed at the 

" Old Statistical Account. 



80 



INVEllNKSS-SHIRK. 



time in question, is in nothing more apparent or more pleas- 
ing, than in the increased facihties of education. The means of 
instruction have been rendered accessible to the poorest, and, 
with the exception, perhaps, of a few solitary instances, to the 
most remote of our population. There was but one, the parish 
school, at the time of the former Statistical Account. In some of 
the present schools, but more particularly in those conducted on 
the Sabbath evenings, several aged people have been taught to 
read, with an ease and accuracy credible only by those who have 
heard them ; while the general diffusion of knowledge, and the 
comparative fewness of those who are unable to read, furnish a 
most pleasing contrast to the gloomy picture of two score years ago, 
when the " greater" number of the people were so illiterate, that 
they could neither read nor write." 

In conclusion, we would only remark, that, were the old sys- 
tem of smaller and more numerous possessions returned to, which 
has been of late years relinquished for that of large extensive 
sheep-walks, and were the system we recommend, to be adopted 
in connection with the approved mode of agriculture, in regard to 
the arable land, the change would tend greatly to prevent emigra- 
tion, and contribute much to the happiness and the prosperity of 
the country at large.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERNETHY, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JOHN MACDONALD, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish derives its name from the small peninsula 
that constitutes the Glebe, and on which the church and manse 
are built. The etymology given of Alvie in the former Statisti- 
cal Account is not in the least probable, and must have been ha- 
zarded without a careful examination of the Celtic name. The 
name is in Gaelic pronounced Ealabhi, sounding hh like v in Eng- 
lish; a word compounded oi ealahh, swans, and i, an island, which, 
correctly translated, signifies the island of swans. What tends in 
a great measure to establish this etymology is, that the lake of Alvie, 
from time immemorial, has been annually visited by a number of 
swans in the spring season. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The parish consists of two divisions, 
separated by the river Spey. The largest and the most populous 
of those divisions, situated on the north-west side of that river, may 
be considered a parallelogram, of which the longest side may mea- 
sure 10, and the shortest 6 miles ; it is bounded on the south-east bv 
the Spey ; on the north-west by the parish of Moy ; on the south- 
west by the parish of Kingussie; and on the north-east bv the 
parish of Duthel. The other division of the parish, situated on 
the opposite side of Spey, extends from north to south in the form 
of a rhomboid, of which the longest sides may measure about 10, 
and the shortest 2 niles ; it is bounded on the east by Rothiemur- 
chus; on the west by the Insh district of Kingussie; on the north by 
the Spey; and on the south by the parish of Blair. The surface 
covered by the parish of Alvie may be computed at 84 square miles. 
The parts of the Grampian mountains, at which the southern ex- 
tremity of the parish terminates, form the highest hills in Scotland, 
being ascertained, by actual measurement, to be 4500 feet above 
the level of the sea. The mountains forming the north-west boun- 
dary of the parish are considerably lower than the Grampians ; but, 

INVERNESS. F 



82 



INVERNESS-SHIKl':. 



as these have not been measured, their elevations above the level 
of the sea cannot be correctly stated. 

Meteorology. — According to a register kept by Sir David Brews- 
ter at Belleville, about 700 feet above the level of the sea, the 
mean temperature of 1834 was about 45°, and the hour of mean 
temperature about 1 33" a. m., and &amp; 47' p. m. The prevail- 
ing winds in this parish, and over the whole valley of Badenoch, 
are the south-west and north-east. In the immediate vicinity of the 
Grampians, through the narrow valley of Glenfeshie, the wind some- 
times blows down from the hills in violent gusts, resembling the hur- 
ricanes of tropical climates, — unroofing houses, tearing the largest 
trees from the root, and carrying all loose substances in its progress 
irresistibly before it. There is no other wind that claims particular 
notice, if we except the whirlwind, which occurs seldom, and only 
in the summer season. The ignorant country people, particularly 
the old, who are strongly wedded to the absurd superstitions of 
their venerated ancestors, consider the whirlwind as indicative of a 
procession of the imaginary beings called fairies. This supersti- 
tion, however, is wearing fast away ; and it is probable that in less 
than half a century, not a trace of it will remain, providing the pro- 
gress of education shall not be obstructed by the failure of adequate 
means to support the schools at present so extensively in operation. 
The venerable Principal Baird, whose labours of love will be long 
remembered with heartfelt gratitude in the Highlands of Scotland, 
has contributed, by his benevolent exertions, in an eminent degree 
to the expulsion of fairies from the Highland hills. 

The Strath of Badenoch being at this place probably not less 
than 650 feet above the level of the sea, it cannot be expected 
that there should be the same quantity of genial warmth as in 
lower situations. There is nothing in which the inferiority of 
the chmate is, in these respects, so perceptible as in the partial 
and often total failure of orchard fruit, such as apples, pears, and 
plums, &amp;c. which never ripen sufficiently in any garden in this 
parish, except on wall-trees. But when the ground is well culti- 
vated and manured, there are as rich crops of corn raised in this 
parish, though somewhat later in ripening, as in any district of 
the low country. The circumstances connected with the climate 
most unfavourable to the produce of the soil are, the long continu- 
ance of frost in the month of May, and the early visit of mildew 
in the month of August. The former retards vegetation, and oc- 
casions a late harvest; the latter, by blasting potatoe crops and 



ALVIE. 



83 



green corn, often disappoints the industrious farmer's expectation, 
even when built upon, the most promising appearance. The cli- 
mate has, however, of late been much improved, for neither frost 
nor mildew have done any harm for the last seven years. 

Diseases. — The diseases most prevalent in the parish are 
scrofula, dropsy, and palsy. These diseases, which are chiefly 
confined to the poorer class of the people, have not the most dis- 
tant connection with any peculiarity in the climate ; for though 
the air is keen and sharp, it is salubrious in a very high degree ; 
as a proof of which, strangers who come to the country in delicate 
health, after a few weeks' residence in the bosom of the hills, be- 
come vigorous and healthy. The principal cause to which the 
prevalence of those diseases may probably be ascribed, is a poor 
watery diet, consisting, for the most part, of vegetable substances, 
such as potatoes, kail, turnips, &amp;c. which, without a due propor- 
tion of animal food to correct their natural tendency, relax the so- 
lids, vitiate the blood, and bring on at last a general debility of the 
system. 

H2jdrography.—T\-ieve are no springs in this parish that merit 
particular notice. The only lake is Loch Alvie, if we except 
Loch Inch, formed by the Spey, the one-half of which may be 
said to be within the parish of Alvie. The length of Loch Alvie, 
which almost surrounds the glebe, may be computed at a mile; 
the breadth half a mile; and the greatest depth 65 feet or 11 fa- 
thoms. Its temperature, for want of a proper instrument to ascer- 
tam It, cannot be correctly stated. The Spey is the only river 
passmg through the parish. Its source is in the Braes of Bade- 
noch, near the border of Lochaber, at a distance of not less than 
30 miles from this place. Its mean breadth may be reckoned at 
50 yards; the average depth of the deepest pools at from 10 to 
12 feet; and its length from its source to Garmouth cannot be 
less than 100 miles. The direction of the Spey is nearly from 
west to east. From the south-west extremity of the parish to 
ioch Inch, a distance of five miles, the course of the Spey is slow 
and gentle ; but from Loch Inch to the other extremity of the pa- 
rish. It flows with considerable rapidity. 

Geology and Mineralogy. -T\,h parish does not furnish much 
matter for geological researches. Under this head, therefore, the 
tollowing information, in popular rather than scientific terms, must 
suthce. 1 he mountains of this parish are composed solely of gneiss, 
which ,s mtersected with veins of granite and red porphyry, „f 



84 



INVERNESS-SHIRK 



which there are fine specimens in the Burn of Raitts at Belleville. 
1 limestone is quarried at Dunachton, a part of Mackintosh's pro- 
perty, and veins of lead occur in the gneiss in the Burn of Raitts, 
and at Tyncaim, both on the property of Belleville. The granite 
is of two kinds, red and white. The red granite is harder and more 
durable, but the white is preferred in building, because it is more 
easily dressed. The soil of this parish is in general light, and the 
substratum either sand or gravel, with the exception of meadow 
ground on the banks of Spey, where the soil is in some places very 
deep, lying on a substratum of clay. 

Botany. — The only herb of rare occurrence peculiar to this parish 
is the Nymphea alba, or white water-lily, which grows abundantly 
in the Lake of Alvie. On the north side of Loch Alvie, a consi- 
derable way up the hill, and on the moors of Belleville, is to be 
found the Betula nana, or dwarf birch, a rare plant, which has not 
been elsewhere discovered in this country. The French willow 
also grows on the rock behind the house of Belleville. The trees 
indigenous to the soil of this parish are, birch, alder, mountain-ash, 
oak, hazel, pine, and aspen tree. 

Plantations. — On the south-west side of Kinrara, the delightful 
and romantic residence of the late Duchess of Gordon, her Grace, 
upwards of thirty years ago, planted an extensive piece of barren 
moor, chiefly with Scots firs, mingled with some larch trees, that 
now combine shelter with ornament. A few years later, she plant- 
ed, on the north-east side of Kinrara, a piece of equally barren 
ground, and nearly of the same extent, with the same kind of wood, 
which is considerably advanced in growth. The present Duchess 
of Gordon, following the example of her illustrious predecessor, 
planted another piece of ground a few years ago, between the 
Spey and the approach to the cottage of Kinrara, with larch, spruce, 
and Scotch firs, which are very thriving. Several years before the 
late Duchess of Gordon began her plantations, James Macpherson, 
Esq. M. P., the celebrated translator of Ossian's poems, planted 
several clumps of larch and Scotch firs at Belleville, by which, be- 
sides the shelter they afford, the appearance of the place is beau- 
tified, and much improved. Mr Macpherson also planted about 
200 acres of the same wood, now grown to a large size, on a rock 
called Craigbuie.

the memory of man, is an incident connected with the retreat of 
some rebels through the parish after the battle of Culloden. These 
rebels, after the defeat of the Pretender's army, being reduced to 
the last extremity, applied to the Rev. Mr William Gordon, then 
minister of Alvie, for relief. Mr Gordon feelingly sympathised with 
them in their sufferings, received them hospitably into his house, 
and humanely afforded them all the relief in his power. Informa- 
mation was directly conveyed to the Duke of Cumberland, then 
stationed at Inverness, that the minister of Alvie favoured the rebel- 
lion by harbouring rebels in his house, and Mr Gordon was in con- 
sequence summoned to appear before the Duke of Cumberland at 
Inverness, to answer for his conduct, — when he fearlessly addressed 
the Duke to the following effect: " May it please your Royal High- 
ness, I am exceedingly straitened between two contrary commands, 
both coming from very high authority. My Heavenly King's Son 
commands to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to give meat and 
drink to my very enemies, and to relieve, to the utmost of my power, 
all objects in distress indiscriminately, that come in my way. My 
earthly king's son commands me to drive the houseless wanderer 
from my door, to shut my bowels of compassion against the cries 
of the needy, and to withhold from my fellow mortals in distress 
the relief which is in my power to afford. Pray, which of these com- 
mands am I to obey "— " By all means," replied the Duke, « obey 
the command of your Heavenly King's Son ; your character is very 
different from what it has been represented ; go home in peace, act 
conformably to the benevolent spirit of that Gospel which you are 
professedly employed to preach and to explain." Thus ended an 
interview, from which a very different result had been anticipated ; 
in a manner equally honourable to the character, both of the hum- 
ble pastor of the parish of Alvie, and the illustrious Commander- 
in- Chief. 

Eminent Characters, -c— The parish of Alvie, although situat- 
ed in a remote Highland glen, has been honoured for nearly half 
a century, particularly during the last forty years, with the occa- 
sional residence and frequent visits of distinguished personages. 
The late Duchess of Gordon, upwards of thirty years ago, "se- 
lected for her summer residence, Kinrara, a romantic situation, 
withm less than two miles from the church of Alvie, where she 
usually resided every year during the remainder of her life, from 
the beginning of July to the beginning of November. In that de- 
lightful , residence, to which her Grace was enthusiastically at-

tached, she was frequently visited by ladies and gentlemen of 
the first distinction in both kingdoms. Her remains were brought, 
at her own desire, from London, where she died, and inter- 
red at Kinrara, on the 12th day of May 1812, in a spot of 
ground which she often pointed out in the course of her walks, 
as the place where she wished her mortal remains to lie. This 
spot is marked by a monument erected by her husband, the late 
Duke of Gordon, constructed of beautiful hewn granite selected 
among the Grampian mountains, some of them at a distance of 
more than twenty miles. 

Soon after the decease of the Duchess of Gordon the Marquis 
and Marchioness of Huntly took possession of Kinrara, where for 
several years they resided annually from the beginning of August 
to the beginning of November, and were visited during that period 
by their numerous noble friends, from all parts of the kingdom.  
Since the Marquis succeeded to the Dukedom of Gordon, their 
annual visits to Kinrara have been discontinued, and the place has 
been let for shooting-quarters to Sir George Sitwell, Baronet. 

Belleville, a district of this parish, has been rendered classical 
ground by the residence of James Macpherson, Esq. the collector 
and translator of Ossian's Poems. By his literary works, Mr 
Macpherson raised himself from the humble situation of a paro- 
chial schoolmaster to a distinguished reputation among men of let- 
ters, and realised an ample fortune, by which he was enabled to 
purchase a good deal of landed property in his native country. His 
remains were carried from Belleville, where he died, to West- 
minster Abbey, and deposited, agreeably to his own particular in- 
struction, in Poet's Corner. Belleville is now the residence of Sir 
David Brewster, whose scientific acquirements entitle him to no- 
tice here, and to whom the writer of this account is indebted for 
some important inforination. It is unnecessary to add, that Sir 
David is a valuable acquisition to the society of this remote but 
beautiful Highland glen, where he enjoys ease with dignity. 

Land-owners. — According to Mr Shaw, in his history of the pro- 
vince of Moray, the Barony of Dunachton came into the possession 
of the Laird of Mackintosh about the year 1500, by his marrying the 
heiress, daughter of the Baron of Dunachton. Here Mackintosh had 
a castle, which was burnt in the year 1689, and was never rebuilt.

property in this parish, commonly called Davochs of the Head, are a 
part of the compensation given for the head of William the 15th 
laird of Mackintosh, who was beheaded by order of the Earl of 
Huntly in the year 1550, when he was paying a friendly visit at 
Huntly Castle. The lands of Belleville, purchased by the transla- 
tor of Ossian, were formerly the property of Ned Mackintosh of 
Borlam, the leader of an infamous gang of robbers, who was ap- 
prehended, but fled from justice upwards of sixty years ago. The 
properties of Invereshie and Belleville were held in feu of the Duke 
of Gordon, till a few years ago, when the superiority was purchased 
from the late Duke. 

Parochial Register. — The oldest parochial register of this pa- 
rish commences in the year 1713, has been very irregularly kept, 
and throws little or no light on the civil history of the parish. Du- 
ring the periods in which it was kept with tolerable regularity, it 
is filled up with disagreeable narratives of sexual immoralities and 
public exhibitions of feigned repentance on the cutty-stool. 

Antiquities. — Contiguous to the barrows or tumuli mentioned 
in the former Statistical Account, there is an extensive plain on 
which a bloody battle is said to have been fought ; but with respect 
to the cause of the battle, the time when it was fought, the clan 
or clans of which the conflicting armies were composed, and the 
leaders that commanded them, tradition is silent. 

At Delfour, about a mile west from the church of Alvie, are to 
be seen the remains of a Druidical cairn, inclosed by a circle of large 
stones closely set up on end, 55 feet in diameter. Within this 
circle, and concentric to it, is another circle, similarly inclosed, with 
stones less in size, 25 feet in diameter. At the distance of 25 
feet west from the cairn stands an obelisk, 8 feet 6 inches high, 

5 feet broad at the bottom, and 15 inches thick, diminishing gra- 
dually in breadth from the bottom, till it terminates at the top in 

6 inches. Whether this obehsk had any connection with the ido- 
latry practised at the cairn contiguous to it, or whether it was 
placed to mark the grave of some distinguished personage, is not 
known. Such, however, is the veneration in which these relics of an- 
tiquity are held even at the present day, that although both the 
cairn and the obelisk stand in the middle of an arable field, and oc- 
casion a considerable interruption to the operation of the plough, 
no attempt has been hitherto made to remove the one or the other.

house of Belleville, and contiguous to the public road, a beautiful marble obelisk

Concerning the cave at Raitts near Belleville, slightly noticed 
in the former Statistical Account, several curious facts have been 
handed down by tradition, which here deserve to be recorded. 
This cave, of which the excavation when entire amounted to 
145 solid yards, was artificially built round with dry stones, and 
covered on the top with large gray flags, by a desperate band 
of depredators, nine in number, commonly called Clannmlticyillena- 
oidh. It is not certain to what particular clan these depredators 
belonged. Instigated by implacable revenge against the Macpher- 
sons, on account of some deadly feud, they secretly dug the cave, 
v/hich is called, after their name, Uaigh Clannmhicgillenaoidh, as 
a place of concealment, from which they occasionally sallied forth 
in the night time to steal and to slaughter the cattle of the Mac- 
phersons, wherever they could be found. Over the cave was erect- 
ed a turf cottage or dwelling-house, such as the people of the coun- 
try inhabited at the time, the inmates of which enjoyed the con- 
fidence of Clannmhicgillenaoidh, were the depositaries of their se- 
crets, and participated along with them in the spoils of the Mae- 
phersons. The Macphersons finding the number of their cattle 
daily diminishing, made a strict search after them, but for a long 
time without effect. At length appearances were noticed about 
the hut erected over the cave, which excited a strong suspicion 
that the lurking place of those depredators could not be very dis- 
tant from that hut. This suspicion was increased by the inhospi- 
table churlishness of the landlord, who, contrary to the custom of 
the times, would permit no stranger to lodge for a single night in his 
house. Accordingly the Macphersons sent one of their number as a 
spy in the garb of a beggar, to solicit a night's lodging in the sus- 
pected hut ; and feigning illness from a fit of the gravel, the beggar 
was allowed to remain in a barn or outhouse for the night. The 
beggar being thus disposed of, the most active preparations com- 
menced within the house for a sumptuous entertainment ; and the 
feast being prepared, a large flag was raised in the centre of the 
house, on which Clannmhicgillenaoidh came out, feasted on the 
Macpherson's choicest beef, along with the inmates of the house, 
and then spent the remainder of the night in search of a fresh sup- 
stands, on which is sculptured a bust, exhibiting a very striking likeness of the tran- 

slator of Ossian. _ , .„ . , , , /. 

On the summit of Tor Alvie, a conspicuous hill, situated north-west trom the ro- 
mantic cottage of Kinrara, a monument has been erected by his Grace the present 
Duke of Gordon, with a beautiful brass plate on the side fronting Kinrara. On this 
plate is an inscrijition commemorative of the officers of the 42d and 9-2d Regiments 
who fell at Waterloo.

ply. The beggar observed all that passed through an aperture on 
the side of the hut, and returned to report what he had seen. In 
consequence of the discovery thus made, the Macphersons collect- 
ed a strong party on the following night, seized and massacred the 
whole band of Clannmhicgillenaoidh, in the cave, demolished the 
hut erected over it, and thus put an end to these freebooters, and 
to all their depredations. The pretended beggar by whom Clann- 
mliicgillenaoidh were betrayed was called Ian Mac Eoghaiwn, or 
John Macewan, and the tribe of the Macphersons descended from 
him are distinguished by the appellation of Sliochd Ian Mhiceo- 
ffhainn, that is John Macewan's descendants. It is said that all this 
tribe have ever since been peculiarly liable, at some period of life, 
to be more or less afflicted with gravel. 

On the meadow of Belleville, between the public road and the 
Spey, is to be seen Lochandu, celebrated in Sir Thomas Dick 
Lauder's novel of that name. This is a pond nearly of an oval 
shape, formed by the Spey, before any embankment had been rais- 
ed to protect the adjacent meadows from the inundations of that 
river. Lochandu was surrounded with a thick belt of natural birch 
trees, that hid it from the sight, till the late Mr Macpherson of 
Belleville, in the course of his improvements, laid it open to view, 
by rooting out the trees, and converting the ground about it to 
arable land. The dark grove, formed by the trees about Loch- 
andu, is said to have been a place of nocturnal rendezvous, where 
Borlum of infamous memory, and his gang of depredators, usually 
met to plan their predatory excursions. 

Modern Buildings. — There are only two buildings in the parish 
entitled to particular notice. The .first of these is the house of 
Belleville, built by the translator of Ossian, after a design by the 
celebrated architect, Robert Adam, Esq. It stands on a beauti- 
ful eminence, conspicuous from the public road, sheltered on the 
north by a plantation of Scotch fir and larch, now grown to a consi- 
derable size, and by the beautiful rock of Craigbuie, covered with 
natural birch, among which are some trees of unusual magnitude. 
The lawn in front of the house is adorned with upwards of 100 
large trees of hard wood, and a fine row of elms along the Old Mi- 
htary Road, planted by Brigadier Mackintosh in 1715. The other 
is the house of Kinrara, built by the late Duchess of Gordon, in 
the form of a cottage, on a very sequestered and romantic spot, 

• Here Borlum murdered, or caused to be murdered, a servant of his own, for re- , 
tusing to go along with him across the Spey to rob the house of a weaver in Killi- 
hinitly, wlio was known to have a good deal of money.

and embosomed in wood. It has been so enlarged from time to 
time, that it has now become an extensive building, and affords con- 
siderable accommodation. 

IIT. — Population. 
The population of the parish of Alvie, as far back as it can be 
traced, is as follows, viz. 



According to the return to Dr Webster in 1735, - 1021 

By the last Statistical Account in 1792, - 1011 

By the Government census in 1811, - 961 

Do. do. 1821, - 963 

Do. do. 1831, - 1092 



The cause of increase in the population at the last census was the 
return of pensioners, who were serving in the army, during the late 
war, and the continuance of young men in the country, on account 
of the difficulty of procuring employment elsewhere since the ter- 



mination of the war. 

The annual average of births for the last seven years is 30 

Do. do. of deaths, for do. 15 

Do. do. of marriages for do. 8 
The average number of persons under 15 years of age is .387 

Betwixt 15 and 30 . - - - 269 

Betwixt 30 and 50, - - - - 2.51 

Upwards of 70, - - - - 48 

The number of unmarried men upwards of 50 years is 18

Character Src of the People. — The inhabitants of the parish in 
general are below the middle size ; but they are uncommonly hardy, 
and capable of enduring much fatigue and privation. The lan- 
guage spoken by the common people, particularly by the old, is the 
Gaelic; but the young of both sexes speak and understand the Eng- 
lish language, and are daily becoming more and more indifferent 
about their native tongue. The only amusements prevalent in this 
parish are camack matches, raffles, and dancing. The old people 
are rather slovenly in their dress ; but the young have a laudable 
taste for cleanliness, and an ambition for finery sometimes beyond 
their means. Potatoes and milk may be said to constitute the prin- 
cipal food of the peasantry : for all the meal which the small tenants 
can raise on their farms, in their mode of cultivating them, would 
not support their families during one-third of the year. The great- 
, est part of the little butter and cheese they make, they must sell to 
pay the rent ; and in regard to animal food, such as beef, mutton.

and poultry, that is a luxury in which the small tenants never in- 
dulge, except at marriage feasts, baptisms, Christmas, andnev'year. 
They are on the whole, however, contented with then- situation : 
and considering their limited means of information, they are sur- 
prisingly intelligent and well informed, naturally inquisitive and 
shrewd in their remarks, and always ready to communicate what 
they know in exchange for the information they receive. They 
are sober and industrious in their habits, just and honest in their 
dealings, and, with a few exceptions, correct and regular in their 
moral conduct. Their attainments in religious knowledge are not 
high; but the measure of knowledge to which they have attained is 
solid and rational, tending more to influence their conduct than to 
ptifi" them up with self-conceit. They are not readily carried about 
by every wind of doctrine, nor captivated by the noisy declamation of 
vagrant preachers. 

There have been three illegitimate births in the parish during 
the last three years.

ing arable, meadow, pasture, ground covered with wood, moor, and

L. I per acre Scotch. The average rate of grazing a cow is L. 1, 10s., 
and for a full-grown sheep 2s. per annum. The rate for farm la- 
bour is, in winter, Is., and in summer Is. 6d. per day, including 
maintenance. The rate of carpenter work is 2s. and of mason 
work, 2s. 6d. per day, when the day admits of working from six 
o'clock in the morning till six o'clock in the evening. 

Live-StocL — The breed of sheep commonly reared in the pa- 
rish is the black-faced. In general no great attention has been 
paid hitherto, to the improvement of sheep or black cattle, and 
still less attention has been paid by the common or small tenants 
to the cultivation of the soil. 

Husbandry. — The absurd and unproductive system of farming

INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



pursued by their rude ancestors from time immemorial is still con- 
tinued by the tenants who have but small holdings, to the preju- 
dice of their own interest, as well as to the deterioration of the 
small pendicles of land which they occupy. The little manure 
they collect, they lay on the patches of ground nearest to their 
dwelling-houses, which they keep in perpetual rotation of potatoes, 
barley, and oats, without ever resting them, till the ground is very 
greatly reduced. The distant parts of the farm, which they call 
out-fields, never receive a single load of manure, but are allowed 
to lie waste for three years, and cropped again for three years 
alternately, — the last crop scarcely returning the seed. They 
seldom or never think of removing a stone out of their way, or of 
draining away the redundant moisture that chills the ground, and 
renders it unfit for bearing. The tenants occupying small pendi- 
cles have neither skill nor capital for carrying on an improved sys- 
tem of farming ; but if they had both, it cannot be denied that 
very little encouragement has been hitherto given by the proprie- 
tors of land, to improving tenants. On a lease of from seven to ele- 
ven years, the longest given till of late in the parish, without any 
security to an improving tenant for payment of his outlays, in case 
of being removed from his farm at the expiration of a short lease, 
no expensive improvement will ever be attempted. Another in- 
surmountable obstacle in the way of agricultural improvement is 
the absurd division of the land among the small tenants. It is not 
uncommon to see a piece of land, not half an acre in extent, di- 
vided into five or six lots, called run-rigs; which makes it impossi- 
ble for any one of the six to improve his small lot, unless the other 
five concur with him. With the exception of two or three farms, 
there are no farm enclosures of any description in the parish ; and 
the farm-buildings of the common tenants are most wretched ho- 
vels, consisting of a few wooden couples, joined together with cross 
spars, and covered with a turf roof, that requires to be renewed al- 
most every second year. 

Recent improvements. — Considerable improveients in agricul- 
ture have been made of late by a few individuals, whose example, 
it is to be hoped, others will be induced to follow. Mr Mac- 
pherson of Belleville made very extensive improvements on that 
part of his property which he himself farmed. By embankments, 
draining, paring, grubbing, &amp;c. he reclaimed upwards of 300 
Scotch acres of meadow ground, naturally fertile, but rendered 
comparatively unproductive by the overflowing of the river Spey, 



ALVIE, 



93 



which he converted to fine arable land, capable of yielding very 
rich crops. He also converted a considerable extent of ground 
covered with wood to arable land, which is at present under a re- 
gular rotation of crops, along with the rest of the farm. Mr John 
Russel, tacksman of Kincraig, the property of the Laird of Mackin- 
tosh, is a very industrious and improving tenant. On a low mea- 
dow attached to his farm, he has, by draining, paring, and digging 
up large blocks of moss-fir, converted about twenty acres of in- 
different pasture to rich arable land. At Dalnavert, also the pro- 
perty of the Laird of Mackintosh, Mr James Clark, the present 
tacksman, nearly doubled the arable land of that farm, by drain- 
ing, grubbing, and embanking, since he came into the possession 
of it. At Dalraddy, the property of Mr Macpherson Grant of 
Ballindalloch, an improved system of farming has been recently- 
commenced, which, when carried into effect, will greatly increase 
the value of that part of Ballindalloch's property. The Duke of 
Gordon's lands having been lately divided into improveable lots, it 
is to be hoped that the tenants will adopt a more improved system 
of farming.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Marliet-Towvs SfX. — There is no market-town in the parish : 
the nearest market-town, to which the people can bring the over- 
plus of their farm produce, is Inverness, situated not less than thirty- 
five miles from the northern extremity of the parish. A village 
has been commenced near the southern, or rather south-west ex- 
tremity of the parish, called Lynchat, on the property of Belle- 
ville : — it is yet only in its infancy. 

Means of Communication. — The parish has a communication by 
post with the south, three times a-week, by Kingussie, Blair-in- 
Athol, and Perth ; and also with the north by Grantown, Forres, 
and Inverness. There is no post-office in the parish ; but there 
is a receiving-house or sub-office, at Lynviulg, within less than 
half a mile from the church, which affords great accommodation. 

Public Roads and Carriages. — The great public I'oad from Edin- 
burgh to Inverness passes through the whole length of this parish ; 
but although toll-gates have been lately placed upon this road, it 



94 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



is in some places so narrow as scarcely to admit of two carriages 
passing abreast. The only public carriage that travels on this road 
is the Caledonian, or, as it is commonly called, the Highland coach. 
It runs three times a-week for nine months of the year, and for the 
other three, only twice a-week. 

Ecclesiastical State, — The situation of the parish church is ex- 
tremely inconvenient to the greater part of the population. It is 
situated in a corner of the parish, at the distance of eight miles 
from the one, and only two miles from the other extremity. It was 
built in the year 1798, and was substantially repaired two years 
ago. There are seats for 500, all free, — which affords sufficient ac- 
commodation for as many of the parishioners as can attend public 
worship in the parish church ; but had the church been centrical- 
ly situated, the accommodation would be deficient. The manse 
was built in ISIO, and was repaired last year. The glebe is very 
small. At the admission of the present incumbent in 1806, there 
were scarcely three acres of arable ground ; but by trenching, grub- 
bing and liming, the arable land may now be estimated at about 
ten acres. The stipend is one of those augmented by the Govern- 
ment, and consequently amounts only to L. 150 per annum, exclu- 
sive of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. There is a Govern- 
ment church at Inch, within four miles of the church of Alvie; and 
the district assigned to it includes a portion of this parish called Da- 
voch of Invermarkie, containing a population of nearly 200. There 
are no sectaries in the parish, with the exception of two Roman Ca- 
tholics and one Baptist. Owing to the inconvenient situation of the 
church, already adverted to, it is not so well attended as it would 
have been otherwise, more particularly in the winter season. The 
number of communicants, exclusive of those residing in the distiict 
connected with the Government church at Inch, is 100. The 
number of male heads of families in communion with the Church, 
exclusive of the district connected with the parish of Inch quoad 
sacra, is 38. 

Education. — There are only two permanent schools in the parish ; 
the parochial school, and a school supported by the Committee of 
the General Assembly. There is a private school taught at Raitts, 
a remote district of the parish, only in the winter season, and sup- 
ported by the parents of the children attending ; a situation in 
which a permanent school is much required. The branches of 
education taught in the parochial school are, Latin, English read- 
ing, English grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and 
geography. The same branches are taught in the two inferior 



ALVIE. 



9.5 



schools, with the exception of Latin, book-keeping and geography, 
and with the addition of Gaehc. The salary of the parochial 
schoolmaster is L. 30, exclusive of two guineas in lieu of a garden. 
The school fees may be estimated at L. 20 per annum ; and the 
accommodation is liberal. The salary of the teacher of the As- 
sembly's school is L. 20, and the school fees may amount to about 
L. 10 per annum. It was estimated in 1833, that there were in 
the parish, upwards of six years of age unable to read, 342 per- 
sons ; and betwixt six and fifteen years of age, 26. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor on 
the parish roll is from 20 to 24. The annual amount of contribu- 
tion for their relief is from L. 12 to L. 15 per annum, arising from 
collections in the church and penalties exacted from delinquents ; 
and this small sum is distributed among them only once a year. 
The poor in general depend, for the most part, on their own in- 
dustry, and the assistance of their nearest relations. They are very 
reluctant, till compelled by dire necessity, to make application for 
parochial aid. To receive assistance from the parish fund is con- 
sidered degrading, and consequently is the last resource of the 
helpless and indigent. 

iMeZ.— Peats and wood are the fuel commonly used in the parish. 
Both these kinds of fuel are at so great a distance, and procured 
at so enormous an expense, that coals carried from Inverness to a 
distance of forty miles, are considered, by those who understand the 
management of them, cheaper fuel than either of these kinds. 
VI. — Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the time of the former Statistical Account, various 
changes have taken place in the state of the country, the mode 
of cultivation, the value of land and farm produce; and in the 
manners, character, and circumstances of the people. In re- 
gard to the state of the country and the mode of cultivation, it 
may be observed, that a spirit of improvement has been lately ex- 
cited among the tenants in general, which, if suitably encour'aged 
by their landlords, will, in the course of some time, greatly ame- 
liorate their condition. Farming operations are at present con- 
ducted with more taste and better skill than they formerly were, 
lurnip and grass husbandry has of late years been carried on 
by tenants even of small holdings. Here and there pieces of waste 
ground, which, in the state of nature, were of little or no value, 
have been brought into culture by trenching and liming, &amp;c. and ' 
rendered productive of both grass and corn. In consequence 
ot these improvements, the parish, even in its present state, pro-

duces meal more than sufficient for the consumption of all the in- 
habitants, which renders it independent of the supplies formerly 
procured at a high price from Strathspey, from the low parts of 
Moray, and sometimes even from Banffshire. 

But all the advantages resulting from these improvements are 
more than counterbalanced by a variety of adverse circumstances, 
with which the farmer has to contend. Since the commencement 
of the late expensive war, besides taxes and public burdens, the 
rent of the land and the wages of farm-servants have been more 
than tripled over the whole parish. During the continuance 
of the war, the price of cattle and sheep, on which all High- 
land tenants chiefly depend, was so high, that the tenants were 
enabled to bear those heavy burdens; but in the present state of 
things, it is entirely out of their power to pay the rents then im- 
posed upon them. Since the peace, the price of cattle has been 
so much reduced, that sometimes three can scarcely be sold at the 
price formerly received for one; while the rent, the expense of 
farm labour, and public burdens, continue still the same without 
any sensible diminution. The unavoidable consequence of keep- 
ing up the rent in those circumstances, is the accumulation of 
arrears to a most enormous amount; which, if rigorously exacted, 
would totally ruin the tenants presently in possession, and eventu- 
ally aff"ect the interests of the land proprietors. 

The means most likely to remedy those evils would be, to give 
longer leases to improving tenants, to make an adequate allowance 
for liming the land, to reduce the rent so as to meet the pressure 
of the times, to make the reduction annually dependent upon im- 
proving the fifth or sixth part of the arable land, according to the 
plan of improvement agreed upon, and to continue the reduction, 
till the land is brought under a complete rotation. A farm thus 
improved would enable the tenant to live more comfortably, and, at 
the same time, to pay a much higher rent than he can possibly do 
with all his industry in the present scourged state of the land. It 
would also very much encourage industry and improvement, if the 
tenants were allowed to build comfortable dwelhng-cottages, and 
farm-houses proportionate in extent to the value of their respec- 
tive farms, with security of indemnification for their outlays, at the 
expiration of their lease; instead of the miserable huts in which 
they and their cattle are on the present system so wretchedly ac- 
commodated.

PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JAMES M'LAUCHLAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

There is perhaps not a parish in Scotland which has undergone 
less change than this, since the time of the former Account. The 
face of the country, the state of agriculture, and the manners of 
the people, are still the same ; the latter perhaps a little modified 
by the influence of education. 

Names.— As may seen by the title, this parish is divided into 
two, one called Moy, and the other Dalarrossie ; they were united 
at a time of which we have no record either written or traditional. 
The name of the former is derived from the word Mah, a plain, 
corresponding with the nature of the ground which lies within the 
distance of two miles round the church ; while the name of the 
latter is generally supposed to be from the Gaelic Dalferghais, 
signifying Fergus's Dale,— this being, as tradition says, one of the 
hunting grounds of Fergus the First of Scotland. This is, however, 
usurping too high a dignity for the place, which at least, in its pre- 
sent state, offers few attractions for a kingly residence. 

Extent, Boundaries.— T\\e united parishes extend, in length, 
to about 30 miles in a south-westerly direction, and in breadth to 
about 5 miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— The greater part of the parish is 
composed of cold bleak hills; while the inhabited portion is merely 
a narrow stripe lying along each side of the river Findhorn. It is, in 
fact, merely a mountain glen,— through which this river flows, hav- 
ing rapid streams joining it, which pour down their torrents through 
every hollow in the mountains. The glen is at an average about 
three quarters of a mile in breadth, and at every turn of the river 
IS studded with farm houses, to which a few arable acres are at- 
tached. Towards the lower end of the glen, the river is joined by 
another smaller stream called the Funtack, which issues out of 

INVERNESS. J

INVEllNESS-SHIRE. 



Loch Moy ; on the banks of which, the church of Moy is situated. 
The larger glen or strath, together with the smaller one of the 
Funtack, form the whole parish. It is commonly called Strath- 
dearn, from xdscje Eire, the Gaelic name of the river Findhorn. The 
whole of the strath was formerly under wood, the remains of which 
are still extant in the shape of bog-fir. The mountain ranges are 
not remarkable either for their height or their fbrmation ; the high- 
est is perhaps not more than 2500 feet above the level of the sea. 
There is but one range of any importance, — called the Monadh-lia 
hills, which extend from Strathdearn, in both directions, towards 
Badenoch and Stratherrick. It is one of the widest ranges in 
Scotland, and is stocked with deer and abundance of game. This 
range is intersected with numerous valleys or glens ; through the 
largest of which flows the Findhorn, before it enters the inhabited 
part of the district. This stream rises out of a very extraordinary 
stone, called the Clach Sgoilte, or cloven stone, from the stream 
issuing through a rent in the stone. This stone is at the very 
head of the valley, which, below this, is joined by various other 
minor glens, each contributing its share to swell the waters of 
the Findhorn. These glens are called shealings ; and the High- 
landers were in the habit of driving their cattle to feed in them 
during the warm season, — where they found abundance of the rich- 
est natural grass. After entering the inhabited country, there are 
few valleys in the mountains, — with the exception, perhaps, of a few 
pretty deep hollows formed by burns, and which are generally cul- 
tivated for about half a mile. 

In the mountains, there are no caverns or natural excavations, if 
we except one spot called Ciste Chraig an Eoin the chest of Craig 
an Eoin, which is a circular hollow surrounded with high rocks, 
and accessible only through one narrow entrance. This hollow is 
situated about a mile from the church of Moy; and from being 
quite close to the pass called Starsach na Gael, « the gate of the 
Highlands," it was used as a place of concealment for their wives 
and children by the Highlanders during their predatory excursions 
into the low country. Here it was that Donald Fraser Smith, at 
Moy, defeated Lord Loudon, who commanded the King's troops 
at Inverness during the Rebellion of 1745 and 1746.  Quite 

• I.oudon had obtained information, that Prince Charles Stuart was at IVIoy Hall ; 
unon which he immediately set oft" from Inverness with a considerable body ot troops, 
in order to take him prisoner. Lady Mackintosh being apprised of this movement, 
ordereel Fraser to collect as many men as he could, and to endeavour to stop lum. 
Fraser obeyed her orders, and on coming to Craig an Eoin stationed his men msucli

close to this place, is also a green spot called Uaigh an duine- 
bheo, " the living man's grave," with which the following tradition 
is connected : A dispute having arisen concerning their marches, 
between the Laird of Mackintosh and Dunmaglass, the latter 
offered to find a man who would declare upon oath that the spot 
indicated by him was the exact march, with the condition, that 
if found to swear falsely, he was to be buried alive. The man 
was brought forward to the spot, swore by the head under his 
bonnet and the earth under his feet, that he stood on Dunma- 
glass's land. On being examined, however, it was found, that he 
had filled his shoes partly with soil from the acknowledged property 
of Dunmaglass, and that he had a cock's head in his bonnet, 
probably that he might save his own, and that he might not be 
considered perjured for swearing by the head of a cock. He was, 
however, found guilty, and paid the penalty of his temerity by be- 
ing buried alive. 

Meteorology. — From the elevation of this district above the level 
of the sea, about 800 feet at an average, and the number of high 
hills which surround it, the temperature is very cold. In summer, 
the average height of the thermometer is about 68° Fahrenheit in 
the shade ; but often it is much higher. In winter, it is remarkable 
as being perhaps the coldest district in Scotland. There are of- 
ten great falls of snow, when at Inverness, which is only twelve miles 
distant, the plough may be seen at work. Indeed, for some years 
before the winter of 1834, the frost has been so severe, that Loch 
Moy has been frozen over for two months; and in March 1833 the 
ice was so firm, that a gentleman drove a tandem round the island 
which is in the middle of it. Funerals also often cross the Find- 
horn on the ice. The Aurora Borealis is very common, and some- 
times vies in brilliancy with the description given by Captain Parry 
of its appearance on the coast of North America. In autumn 
1833, it was visible every clear night for two months ; and some- 
times, the prismatic colours are as distinct as if formed by a prism. 

This strath is very subject to high winds, which come down 
sometimes in fearful eddies through the glen, unroofing houses, 
and tearing up trees. The prevailing winds are the westerly and 
the south-easterly, the former blowing during part of the summer, 
the whole of autumn, and part of the winter months ; the latter, 
generally during the remaining months, especially those of March,

100 INVEUNESS-SHIRE. 

April, and May. The inhabitants here, as in every other part of 
the Highlands, are particularly accustomed to foretel the weather 
from natural phenomena. — This parish is perhaps one of the most 
healthy in Scotland, if we may judge from the number of people 
who arrive at a very advanced age. There are many now in the 
parish who are eighty, eighty-five, and ninety years old, and still 
retain their faculties entire ; and some years ago a woman died at 
the age of a hundred. Scrofulous affections are becoming com- 
mon ; and consumptions, fevers, and nervous disorders, are by no 
means unknown. 

Hydrography. — This parish is wholly inland, and is, at the near- 
est point, ten miles distant from the sea. There is but one lake 
of any importance,— called Loch Moy ; it is about a mile and a half 
long, and about half a mile broad. Its depth in some places has 
been found to be eighteen fathoms ; this is, however, far from be- 
ing the average. The lake is situated close to the House of Moy 
Hall, which stands on the north side, and to the manse and church 
of Moy, situated on the south. It is surrounded by wood, and 
the hanging birch copse has in summer a beautiful appearance. 
There are two islands in the lake, in one of which stands the ruins 
of the old residence of the family of Mackintosh. A street has 
also been traced in it, so that it is probable that part of his clan 
lived in the island with their chief. There stands also on the is- 
land a handsome monument, built in 18-24, by Lady Mackintosh, 
in memory of her husband. Sir neas Mackintosh, Bart. It is an 
elegant building, in the shape of a tapering square pillar, and cost 
about L. 1000. The other island is merely a heap of stones, pro- 
bably artificial, and was used by the lairds of Mackintosh as a pri- 
son. In the memory of men now living, there was a gallows standing 
upon it, which the lairds used for execution. Some years ago, there 
was a cannon ball of about ten pounds weight, found buried in the 
large island; and on the south side of the lake there was a sort of 
causeway discovered, in the middle of which there was a large paved 
circle, with an immense stone perforated like a mill-stone in the 
centre. This was supposed to be a way made for carrying cannon, 
and perhaps the ball may go so far to prove this; but the true nature 
of it is difficult to ascertain. Towards the north-west end of the 
lake, there are a number of chalybeate springs ; one of them seems 
to be impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, but the exact pro- 
portions have not been ascertained. These have been tried as to 
their medical properties and with considerable success. The cha-

lybeate springs one in particular throw up an immense quantity 
of slimy red matter, which very soon chokes up the fountain, if not 
cleared away. From the quantity thrown up, the mineral body 
which impregnates the water must exist in great abundance. 

There is but one river of importance which flows through the pa- 
rish ; that, as mentioneti already, is the Findhorn. It rises in the 
Monadh-lia hills, and, after a very rapid course of sixty miles, falls 
into the Moray Frith at Findhorn, near Forres. Its Gaelic name 
is Eire, or, as pronounced, Eur. It is remarkable for the rapidity 
with which it rises and falls. It has been known to rise within 
such a short space of time, that persons crossing it, where it was 
quite low, have been overtaken in a moment, and carried away by 
the irresistible torrent. Its course is so rapid that it never me- 
anders, and often carries away great portions of the soil, in forming 
a straight course for itself. The stream is, however, easily forded 
in summer. It is crossed by two bridges within the parish ; and 
when practicable, the people cross it in other parts upon stilts. 
One of the bridges is entirely built of wood ; and a temporary sub- 
stitute for the stone one was carried off by the great flood in 1829. 
The other is a fine new building with stone pillars and a wooden 
frame-work, built by Messrs Gibb of Aberdeen, at the cot of 
L. 2600 Sterling, 

It is unnecessary here to give an account of the losses occa- 
sioned by the flood in 1829, as there is such an accurate one af- 
forded by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, and likewise because the loss 
in this district, though great, was not so great as in many others, 
if we except that of bridges, all of which, we believe, with the ex- 
ception of two, were carried off by the force of the streams. These 
are now replaced, and, except in one place, where the river changed 
its course entirely, and destroyed one of the richest flats of land 
m the parish, the country is in the same state as it was in, before 
that awful visitation. 

Geolorjij.—ThetQ is little interesting in the geological formation 
of this parish. The primitive rocks are granite and gneiss, which 
are rarely if ever covered with secondary strata. The action of 
great bodies of water is everywhere evident from the nature of the 
surfaces of the hills. In the upper part, where the fall is greatest, 
the hdls rise almost perpendicularly from the river; lower down, 
the nature of the soil admitted of a greater excavation,— whence the 
strath widens, and at the lower extremity there seems to have been 
the bed of a lake, which was drained by the water cutting through 



102 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



the barrier of hills which restrained it. Whether this was a dilu- 
vian or a post-diluvian action, it is impossible to say; but the quan- 
tity and the power of the water must have been prodigious. This 
circumstance is noticed with great clearness in Sir Thomas Dick 
Lauder's Account. His estimate of the height of the lake of Moy 
above the river, however, is erroneous ; instead of being eighteen, 
it is about thirty feet ; and the ascent from that" till the river could 
fall into the Nairn, is at least thirty more,— so that the lake must 
have extended all the way up to this extreme height, which is at 
least eight miles, or the river must have excavated its channel to 
the present level below that height; — the latter is the more likely 
supposition, and if it could be ascertained what time the river takes 
to excavate a certain depth, the time at which the change of course 
took place might be discovered. 

Zoology. — The animals in this district are the same as those com- 
mon to the other parishes around. They are red-deer, roe, hares, 
foxes, polecats, wild cats, weasels, &amp;c. There have been two of a 
species not common in the Highlands shot lately in the parish. 
It is, we believe, called the martin cat, brown over the back, and 
white along the belly and neck, and about two feet and a half in 
length from the point of the nose to the tip of the tail, and nine inches 
in height. It generally lodges in old birds' nests. Except these two, 
no others of the kind have been here seen. There are no other 
animals any way remarkable now existing ; but there are numerous 
indications of the wolf, chiefly in the traps formed for taking them. 

The fish in the waters of this parish are chiefly salmon, river 
trout, char, and eel. The former come up the Findhorn,— though 
of late years the strictness maintained in the cruives at Forres has 
rendered them very scarce. This has led people to kill them with 
torches in close-time,— by which means they destroy more fish than 
they could kill in twenty years by the rod. The Findhorn is an 
excellent trouting stream ; there is not perhaps a better in the north. 
The fish, though not particularly large, are excellent, and they take 
a fly with great readiness. Loch Moy is more noted for its char 
than for its trout. The former are caught in great abundance 

• The method of taking this animal practised in the Highlands was as follows : 
a large deep hole was dug in some place frequented by the wolf ; half way,across 
the mouth of the pit a broad plank was projected, abouthalf of which lay upon the 
ground, and had upon the end farthest from the pit a weight sufficient to balance a 
wolf, until pretty far advanced above the pit ; on the other end was placed a 
bait ' and the remainder of the pit was covered over with brush. wood, so as to de- 
ceive the animal. The wolf advanced to the bait along the plank which, when he 
overbalanced the weight on the other end, immediately fell in, and he was precipi- 
tated into the pit. Numerous remains of these jits arc still in existence.

with a net, as they do not take the fly ; and if properly prepared 
they would, we doubt not, equal the potted char of the Cumberland 
lakes. The trout go up the burns to spawn in the beginning of 
November, — when immense numbers of them are killed with spears, 
— a practice which ought to be stopped by the legislature, as it is 
most destructive to the fish, not only here but all over the High- 
lands. The char spawn by the sides of the lake in October ; and 
this is the time in which they are considered most delicate. The 
parish is well stocked with grouse, ptarmigan, &amp;c. ; and their usual 
accompaniments, English sportsmen, are not wanting. In fact, the 
one seems now to be as closely connected with the other, as cause 
and effect, and the only thing which will ever put a stop to it, is 
the annihilation of the grouse — an event which does not seem far 
distant. 

Botany. — The plants in the parish are those common in every 
Highland district ; and, as far as is yet known, there is but one very 
rare plant to be found. This is the Orolus niger, which was dis- 
covered in the year 1820 by Dr Alexander M'Lauchlan; and a 
specimen was sent by him to Dr Hooker, Glasgow. The locali- 
ty of the plant is in Craig an Eoin, the rock already referred to, as 
being about a mile to the west of the church of Moy. Many sci- 
entific gentlemen have searched for it since, but I believe have 
always failed of obtaining it, probably from not being acquainted 
with the exact situation in which it is to be found. The plants 
used as medicine are chiefly the leaf of the whortleberry, tussila- 
go, &amp;c. and the people generally bind up wounds with a blade of 
common cabbage, or a leaf of tobacco. In dyeing, they use the 
bark of the common alder, which, with copperas, produces a fine 
black. They also dye green and yellow with heather. They 
likewise dye various other colours, but black, blue, green, and red 
are those universally used for their clothing. The common alder 
is prevalent about lakes, and on the borders of rivers, and in 
marshy places ; but the country also affords fir, ash, aspen, larch, 
lately introduced, birch, mountain-ash, and some other hard- 
wood trees when planted in favourable situations. Fir, birch, 
and mountain-ash are, however, the most general. Of the former 
there are several plantations belonging to Mackintosh of Mackin- 
tosh, which are very thriving ; but the largest are on the property 
of Mr Macbean of Tomatin. He has about 80 acres in full growth, 
and has lately planted trees to the number of one million and a

half. There are also some very thriving plantations on the pro- 
perties of Corrybrough H. Macqueen Esq. and of Dalmigavie 
Campbell Mackintosh, Esq. Larch is now coming into general 
use, and in every plantation it forms the one-half at least. There 
are some fine old plane and ash trees in the island of lioch Moy, 
which must have stood there several centuries ; and there are still 
to he traced there the remains of a garden, in sotne cherry and gean 
trees, which surround part of the old castle. 

II. — Civil History. 
Any account which can be obtained of the ancient history of the 
parish must be derived from tradition, as there are few if any writ- 
ten records. There is, however, one manuscript kept in Moy Hall, 
written by Lady Ann Duff, giving an account of the Rebellion in 
1715, with a very interesting account of many other events, which 
took place prior to that period. This lady was the wife of Lach- 
lan Mackintosh, Esq. of Mackintosh, and acted a conspicuous part 
during the Rebellion. The Presbytery records carry the history 
back as far as 1680 ; but part of the session records were destroyed 
several years ago, from the school-house taking fire. We learn 
from the former, that Episcopal jurisdiction continued till about 
the year 1727, when the first Presbyterian minister Mr Leslie 
was settled. It is related in proof of the barbarous state of the 
country, that the first time Mr Leslie went to preach in Dalarros- 
sie, he found a great multitude of people putting the stone, and 
amusing themselves otherwise about the church. He found it 
impossible to gain a hearing, until he agreed to try his strength 
in putting the stone, on condition that they would agree to join him af- 
terwards in the church, if he should be found to surpass them. Mr 
Leslie being a powerful man distanced them all, — which so attract- 
ed the respect of the people, that he soon brought them round to 
regularity and order. The traditional history is principally taken 
up with the feuds of the Mackintoshs and the Cummings; and many 
tumuH are pointed out as the graves of the slain. Some of these 
have been opened and bones found ; and stone arrow-heads and 
dirks have also been discovered on the battle fields, several of which 
are now deposited in the Inverness museum. There is one extra- 
ordinary coup du main, related of a Mackintosh during these wars, 
which has been referred to in a very correct work, lately published, by 
the Messrs Anderson, Solicitors, of Inverness. The circumstances 
of the case were as follows :— During a long war between these two 



MOY AND DALARROSSIE. 



105 



hostile clans, the Cummings had at length driven the Mackintoshs 
for refuge into the island of Loch Moy. Here they formed the re- 
solution of damming the loch, where the Funtack issues from it, and 
thus, by raising the water, to cover the island and drown them. They 
proceeded with their plan till the Mackintoshs were on the eve of 
destruction, when one of the latter offered, if allowed, to liberate 
themselves and destroy the Cummings. He accordingly got a raft 
made, and supplying himself'with corks or wooden plugs and twine, 
he descended in the dead of night to the dam. This was lined, 
towards the water, with boards, through which the adventurer bor- 
ed a number of holes with an auger, and in each hole he put a plug 
with a string attached. All these were attached to one general 
rope, which, when all was ready, he pulled. When the plugs were 
extracted, the water rushed out with fearful force, carried away the 
turf bank, and the whole army of the Cummings, who were encamp- 
ed behind it. It is said that the daring adventurer perished with 
his enemies, the force of the water being so great, when the dam 
gave way, that it swept raft and man along with it. That this event 
took place at Loch Moy is evident from uniform tradition, from 
the nature of the place where the dam was erected, it being a 
narrow gorge easily admitting of such a construction, and also 
from the fact, that in cleaning the mouth of the lake, some years 
ago, a number of stakes and beams were discovered fixed about 
six feet under the surface of the ground, which were evident- 
ly fitted for cross boards, and which, from their appearance, must 
have lain there from time immemorial.. Both lakes may claim the 
honour of this transaction ; but Lochindorb does not .seem so well 
fitted for it, and Edward HL was not a man to be taken in such a 
manner. 

Eminent Men. — The only eminent literary individual of whom 
the parish can boast, is Sir James Mackintosh, Knight, a name 
well fitted to cast a lustre round any spot in the world. He was 
descended of the ancient family of Killachy ; and although born in 
the parish of Dores, whither his mother had gone to visit a rela- 
tion, he spent the greater part of his youth on his paternal pro- 
perty. Although obliged to part with his paternal inheritance, and 
remove from the land "of his youth, by his numerous literary and 
political avocations, he never forgot it, but during his whole life- 
time took an interest in every thing which regarded it. 

Land-owners. — The number of heritors is eleven, most of them 
with very small holdings. These are Mackintosh of Mackintosh ; 



106 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



Mackintosh of Holm ; Mackintosh of Killacliy ; Macbean of To- 
matin; Mackintosh ol Aberarder; Earl of Moray; Mackintosh of 
Dalmigavie; Mackintosh of Balnespuk; Macqueen of Corry- 
brough ; the Earl of Cawdor ; and Mackintosh of Raigmore. Of 
these not one resides in the parish, except Mr Macbean of To- 
matin, who spends part of the summer months in it. This is a 
great disadvantage to the district, as non-resident proprietors are 
the bane of any country. Till of late the number of gentlemen 
farmers made up the loss ; but of these, there is not one now to 
whom the country people can refer, so that the clergyman is oblig- 
ed to take on himself the duty of a Justice of Peace. 

Parochial Registers. — As mentioned already, the old parochial 
registers were destroyed by fire. There is now, however, one of 
births kept. The other business which comes before a session is 
generally of such a nature, that the recording of it could be of no 
use. 

Mansion Houses. — Only two or three of the proprietors have 
residences in the parish ; the principal of these is Moy Hall, situ- 
ated at the north end of Loch Moy. It is a modern house, con- 
sisting of a middle square with two wings, and is in every respect 
a commodious residence. It is now inhabited by the Dowager 
Lady Mackintosh, the proprietor himself living at Daviot. The 
other residences are plain, though generally comfortable buildings. 

III. — Population. 

The earliest census of the parish is that of Dr Webster in 
1755, at which time the population amounted to 1693. At the 
time of the last Statistical Account, the number was 1813. In 
1821, however, it had decreased to 133; and in 1831, when 
the last Government census was taken, there were only 1098, viz. 
427 males, and 47 1 females. This decrease must be wholly attri - 
buted to emigration. The proprietors in many places have turn- 
ed away the whole body of their tenantry, and let their lands out 
in large sheep farms. This system is a most injurious one to the 
country ; for in the event of a war, Britain is deprived of a set of 
the best soldiers in existence. Besides, there is no doubt that land 
well subdivided returns a better rent than large farms ; and it is 
reasonable to suppose that three or four tenants could raise more 
on the same piece of land than one could do. 

There are no towns or villages in the parish, and hence the peo- 
ple are thinly scattered over the whole district. The average of 
births for the last seven years is about 20, of marriages 7, and of

deaths, about 15. The number of persons under fifteen years of 
age is supposed to be, at an average, about 350; between fifteen 
and thirty, about 270 ; betwixt thirty and fifty, about 228 ; betwixt 
fifty and seventy, 200 ; and above seventy, 50. The number of 
unmarried men,, bachelors, and widowers, upwards of fifty years of 
age, is about 68, and of unmarried women about 180, including wi- 
dows. The number of families is 262, in each of which there is, 
at an average, three children. The number of inhabited houses 
is 212; and the number of uninhabited or now building is 22. 

The number of families chiefly employed in agriculture is . . ] 08

There are two insane persons in the parish, one blind and one 
deaf and dumb. 

Character, Sfc. of the People. — The people are generally of a 
hardy constitution, and remarkably well-foi'med, — so that as hand- 
some a company of soldiers could be got in this district as in any 
part of Scotland. This is owing to their constitutions not being 
broken by hard labour when young, — as they then generally oc- 
cupy their time in herding cattle, or in driving them to the southern 
markets. The language spoken is the Gaehc, which is generally 
spoken very correctly, but, from the increasing admixture of Eng- 
lish, we doubt not that, in a few years, it will be lost altogether. 
The old customs of the Highlanders are also in a great measure 
neglected ; few or none wear the kilt and belted plaid ; and the 
ancient superstitions, with the ceremonies connected with them, are 
vanishing away. The game chiefly played is the club and ball, 
which forms the winter amusement, and the collecting of the people 
for atrial of skill at this game is the only remnant of the old mode 
of celebrating the Christmas and new year holydays. The belief 
in ghosts and fairies still exists, but in a very modified degree. At 
funerals the whole people of the parish are generally collected, if 
the deceased be a person of respectability ; and those who are invit- 
ed, alternately by two and two, watch the body in the churchyard 
— a very unnecessary trouble. They do not drink much of ardent 
spirits at funerals, since they are limited by the Justices of Peace 
to three glasses of whisky, — two in the house before starting and 
one in the churchyard. On marriage occasions, a bagpipe always 
precedes the parties on their way to the church, and in the even- 
ing there is a dinner given gratis, and drinking afterwards, for which 
each pays a certain sum. There are always music and dancing. Up- 
on the whole, however, the character of the people is very moral. 



108 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



They seldom drink to excess, and drunken brawls are rare. They 
are regular in their attendance on divine worship ; and it may safely 
be said that there is scarcely a family in the whole parish in which 
family devotion is not maintained morning and evening. With 
all this, there is not much vital Christianity; a sort of rigid, 
cold morality is the characteristic of their religion. The people 
generally live comfortably, considering their station. They have 
bread, potatoes, milk, butter and • cheese, and many of them ani- 
mal food ; and for the most part they are cheerful and contented, 
and particularly kind to the poor. If any thing can be particu- 
larized as unfavourable in their character, it is, that they are pos- 
sessed of their full share of that sly, low cunning which is so com- 
mon among Highlanders. The houses are generally built like 
those of their ancestors; but there are a good many stone and lime 
houses building now. They retain the dirty habit of having the 
dunghill before the door, — a habit which it seems impossible to 
cure. Poaching is little known; and the game laws are very 
strict, and readily put in force against offenders. The fishing of 
the streams is not prevented by the proprietors, and, indeed, is scarce- 
ly worth the prohibiting, — as they are non-resident, and the num- 
ber of fish killed can have little effect upon the fishing. Killing the 
fish by torch light, at spawning time, is, however, much practised, 
and is most injurious to the fishing, as they are then in shallow water, 
and utterly helpless. Smuggling prevails to a considerable extent, 
especially in winter ; but it has not been found to be accompanied 
by those heinous effects which have accompanied it in many places. 
They merely resort to it as a more profitable method of getting 
quit of their barley, than selling it in raw grain ; and, in fact, it is 
not looked upon as a breach of the law. The people have strong 
prejudices against medical advice ; and often require the sanction 
of their minister before they take such medicines as are prescribed. 
There is an Infirmary at Inverness for affording medical relief to 
the poor; but this, although often of great benefit, is only used in 
extreme cases, and even then with great reluctance. The people 
themselves have little medical knowledge, and whether for a fever 
or a cold, or consumption, or a pleurisy, whisky is the universal an- 
tidote. Within the last year or two, they are improving in this 
respect; but their prejudices, although shaken, are far from being 
removed. 

IV. — Industry. 
This parish is wholly agricultural, so that the whole males are

employed in farm labour, except the few artisans employed by the 
inhabitants. There is nothing in the way of manufacturing, if we 
except the home-made cloths manufactured by the families. The 
quantity of this, however, is diminishing, as they find it more pro- 
fitable to sell their wool, and to purchase cloth. There are weav- 
ers, 6; tailors, 5; blacksrniths,3 ; and carpenters, 7 ; and 1 cooper. 
These are kept in employment by the country people. There are 
also a few dry-stone masons for building houses, dikes, &amp;c. Every 
man is his own shoemaker, or rather brogue-maker ; a shoemaker 
has, however, lately settled in the country. Some of the people ge- 
nerally keep a few articles, such as snuff, tobacco, &amp;c. for retail; but 
there is no regular shop in the parish. Few of the tenants keep 
men-servants, since their children generally remain with them un- 
til they marry, or settle otherwise ; but on large farms there are, 
between agriculturists and shepherds, above the age of twenty, 
about 25 male servants, and under that age, 53; female servants, 37. 

Agriculture. — There is little of the parish, in proportion to its size, 
under cultivation ; at the utmost, it is but 2820 acres, and a great 
part of this is merely butshot, or occasionally under tillage. Besides 
this, the number of acres in waste, including the hill pasture, is 
93,180 imperial acres. There is little of this which could be pro- 
fitably made arable, since sheep "pay so well ; and probably not 
more than 1300 acres are improvable with advantage. 

A considerable part of the hill pasture is in common, especially 
where there are two or three tenants in one farm ; and the extent 
of this commonty may be fairly estimated at 23,000 acres. Wood 
is generally scarce of late years ; but planting is becoming more 
general. Mr Macbean of Tomatin has planted about a million and 
a-half of larch and fir trees, on his property ; and there are con- 
siderable old plantations on the estate of Mackintosh near Moy Hall.

Live StocL~The breed of sheep and cattle has been much im- 

rr N .f 1 ''''-' P the small 

white Highland breed, and the Highland black Lttle are daily im- 
proving in size and quality. The Highland Society gave some 
prizes a few years ago, which roused the spirit of emulation, and 
raised a desire for better cattle. 

Husbandry.--The general syStem of husbandry is, however, not 
good. Lime is unknown, except among the more wealthy; and 
black oats are tie most common grain. After a series of crops, 
the land is left for a year in ley ; which they manure again, and 
so on, giving the greater portion of the manure to the leyland, in- 
stead of laying it on green crop, which only consists of a few po- 
tatoes Were lime introduced, the improvement would be astonish- 
ing; for where this has been the case, the soil has been so rich as 
to give in one place fifteen returns of wheat, and in another seven- 
teen returns of barley. The soil is in most parts alluvial, and where 
this IS not the case it is fine black mould. The nature of the leases 
IS much against improvement. The tenants are almost all tenants at 
will, or from year to year; and, besides, their lands are so subdivided 
being ridge about, as it is called, that improvement is almost out 
of the question. This state of things is changing now, and nineteen 
years leases are becoming common ; good farm steadings are in the 
course of being built, and many comfortable houses erected, espe- 
cially on the estate of Mackintosh, and also on that of Tomatin. 
The people themselves are not very spirited ; they are unwilling to" 
give up old customs, so that the landlords have the trouble of forcino-

their good things on the tenants. By degrees, however, they are 
improving, and in a few years we may expect to see as comfortable 
and substantial a set of tenantry here as we can see any where. 

Produce. — The amount and value of the raw produce raised in 
the parish, as far as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds whether cultivated for food of 

man or of domestic animals, . . . . . L. 5640 0 0 

Potatoes and turnips . . ..... 700 0 0

Markets, Sfc. — The nearest market-town is Inverness, which is dis- 
tant about twelve miles from Moy. Here the people sell all their com- 
modities, such as butter, cheese, &amp;c. There are three principal mar- 
kets held there in the year, the Marymas in August, Martinmas in 
November, and Candlemas in February. Inverness is also the near- 
est post-town ; but it is in contemplation to bring the mail by the 
Highland road, and then letters can be had quite at hand. This 
road passes through the parish for ten miles, and has lately under- 
gone a great improvement, both as to the line, which was formerly 
very steep, and as to the length, it being now shortened by about 
three miles. The Highland coach to Perth from Inverness passes 
along it, once every day, and is generally well filled with passengers. 
Besides this, there are various district roads intersecting the pa- 
rish, which are made by the converted Statute Labour. The bridges 
on the district roads are all wooden, and are often swept away by 
the streams. The stone bridge over the Findhorn was swept away 
in 1,829, and has been replaced by a handsome edifice, the arches 
of which are of wood supported on stone pillars. This bridge was 
built at an expense of L. 2600. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There are two churches in this parish, one 
at Moy and the other at Dalarrossie, in which divine service is per- 
formed alternately. The one at Moy is very ill situated, being quite 
in a corner of the parish, and far from the great body of the po- 
pulation. That at Dalarrossie is perfectly centrical, and, except 
when the river is high, easily accessible by the whole parish. 
Both the churches are old. The church at Moy was built in the 
year 1765, and was substantially repaired in 1829. It is, however, 



112 



INVERNESS-SIIIRE. 



cold in winter, there being no less than five doors to it. The 
church of Dalarrossie was built in 1790, and is in every respect as 
good as the church of Moy, except in not being ceiled; that is, 
however, easily remedied. Both churches are situated in a church- 
yard. That at Dalarrossie is remarkable as not having a stone 
the size of an egg to the depth of seven feet, although surrounded 
by stony soil. The tradition is, that it was sifted by the Druids. 
The churches contain about 450 sitters each. These seats are all 
free except that the tenant, on taking possession, pays a few shil- 
lings, — which on vacating is repaid by the incoming tenant. 

The manse is situated at the church of Moy, nine miles from 
Dalarrossie, and was built in 1765. A wing was added in 1810 ; 
but it is far from being comfortable. There are glebes in both pa- 
rishes, to both of which are attached commonties on the neigh- 
bouring farms, and, including this, they may each be worth about 
L. 6 per annum. The stipend amounts to 15 chalders victual, 
half barley, half meal, besides L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
From 1797, when it was first augmented, until 1812, it was only 
L. 105 SterHng. In 1812, it was raised to 12 chalders victual ; and 
in 1832 it was augmented to the present amount of 15 chalders, 
with barley substituted for bear, which constituted half of the old 
stipend. Besides the parish chuithes, there is no other place of 
worship in the parish ; indeed, there are only one or two Dissenters 
Episcopalians in the parish, and these are regular in their attend- 
ance on the Established Church. Divine service is very well at- 
tended in both churches ; but the population being more dense 
around that of Dalarrossie, the congregation is generally larger. 
The sacrament is dispensed once each year, and is generally at- 
tended, by all the neighbouring parishes, so that on Sabbath the 
number is seldom less than 5000. As in most parts of the High- 
lands, there is a meeting for discussing religious topics on the Fri- 
day before the communion, in which pious men from all parts of 
the country take a part. The number of communicants is very 
small; at an average it is not above 30 ; but including communicants 
from neighbouring parishes, about 250 generally communicate here. 
There are various reasons for there being so few in tlie parish ; 
but it is chiefly owing to the peculiar doctrines instilled into the 
minds of the people, chiefly by demagogues, in regard to the sa- 
crament of the supper. 

There are few collections made for religious and charitable pur- 
poses. The people are poor. There are few gentlemen of wealth ; 



MOY AND DALARROSSIE. 



113 



and, with the exception of the little they get from the poors' fund, 
the poor are entirely supported by the benevolence of the parishion- 
ers. There is, however, generally about L. 12 Sterling per annum, 
collected chiefly for the General Assembly's India Mission, the 
Inverness Education Society, and the Northern Infirmary. This 
may appear small; but when the situation of the people is consider- 
ed, the sum will appear very considerable. These collections are al- 
most all made either in the church, or by sending some persons round 
as collectors. This is generally done by the district schoolmasters, 
who know the situation and circumstances of most of the people. 

Education. — There is perhaps not a parish in Scotland where 
education is carried on to a greater extent than here. There is a 
school in almost every nook, and there is at present one individual 
out of every 3| under education. This is what can be said of no 
other parish in Scotland, although we have lately seen the number 
at school in a good many of them stated at 1 in 4, or 1 in 5. The 
schools are as follows : Parochial school, 1 ; aid schools by Societies, 
6 ; school for girls by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge, 1. The branches taught are, reading English and Gaelic, 
English grammar, writing and arithmetic, with Latin and book-keep- 
ing in some instances. The pupils are carefully instructed in the 
Shorter Catechism in both languages, and religious instruction forms 
a great part of the course of education. They are also habituated 
to writing original letters, bills, receipts, &amp;c. and this has been found 
to be of great advantage. The parish schoolmaster has a salary of 
L, 30, with a good house and garden ; and, including fees, the 
yearly income will amount to about L. 40 Sterling. The fees are 
the same in all the schools, and amount to Is. 6d. per quarter for 
reading and writing, and 2s. 6d. for the higher branches, as arith- 
metic, book-keeping, &amp;c. The other schools , are upon the aid 
scheme, and supported partly by the people, and partly by the In- 
verness Education Society. Some of the best informed country 
lads are employed during the winter half-year, by the people who 
have the choice of the schoolmaster; and each gets Is. per quarter for 
each scholar from the Society. This system has answered uncom- 
monly well; and, were it introduced more generally in the Highlands, 
would be productiveof the most beneficial consequences, andthe ex- 
pense of supporting it is a mere trifle. The six schools in the parish 
were sustained last year at an expense of only L. 12 to the Society, 
and of little beyond the living of the schoolmaster to the people. 
Indeed, the masters have little above L. 5 each in the half-year for 

INVERNESS. H

their services, yet they are satisfied. There is a great emulation be- 
tween the different teachers, and the great question is, who will 
have the best school on the day when they are all brought together 
for examination. This is a day looked forward to as one of the 
most important in the whole year, by both young and old, and it 
has always proved a source of great satisfaction to those who at- 
tend at the examination. The state of education is improving 
yearly ; and there is one fault peculiar to the Highlands, which has 
been got quit of, and that is, the long drawl with which the words 
are pronounced in reading. This is now removed, and the style 
of reading is generally excellent. There is a school for girls sup- 
ported by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, in 
which the pupils are taught sewing and all sorts of needle-work, and 
are kept in mind of their reading and writing. The school is gene- 
rally attended by from 15 to 20 scholars. The salary is L. 5 a-year to 
the mistress, besides some trifling fees. From the number of schools, 
there is not one person in the parish between the ages of six and fif- 
teen, who cannot read or write ; and above that age, the number can- 
not be above 125 ; the number at the last enumeration being 145. 
These are, however, all old people, and are dying fast away, so 
that soon there will not be an uneducated person in the parish. 
Education is prized very highly. Every one who can, goes to school, 
and this desire has been so well met by the Inverness Society, that 
there is not a single additional school wanted, — except that it would 
be highly advantageous were one of the schools permanent, i. e. kept 
up for the whole year, since the aid schools only continue six 
months, and sometimes not quite so much. The General Assem- 
bly's Committee has been petitioned to this effect ; and it is hoped 
that the petition may be attended with success, as the object is 
highly praiseworthy, and the people and heritors are willing to af- 
ford every accommodation. This prevalence of education has had 
a great effect on the intelligence of the people. Every two or three 
villages join in getting a newspaper, and this has as yet had no bad 
effect ; and it is to be hoped will have none. As to their morals, 
they have always been remarkable for sobriety, steadiness, and ho- 
nesty; and education has perhaps in general tended to confirm these 
good qualities. Education takes a long time to produce a com- 
plete change upon the manners and views of a country ; it lies for 
a long time on the surface, and it has not yet taken deep enough 
root here, to produce any visible effect upon the morals of the 

inhabitants. It, however, promises fair ; and we hope in a few 

3 



MOY AND DALAROSSIE. 



115 



years to see education take its full effect, and attended by those 
beneficial results which it is calculated to produce. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor is great for 
the population ; and the sum to meet their support is in general 
very low. The average number of poor is 40 ; these are divided 
into classes, which receive according to their necessities. They 
receive at an average, the first class, 12s. per annum; second do. 
10s. do.; third do. 7s. do. The annual collections amount to 
about L. 13, 14s. lid. exclusive of donations. These generally 
amount to about L. 8 per annum ; besides which, the sum of L. 54 has 
been bequeathed for the use of the poor, viz. L. 10 by the late Lodo- 
vick Macbean, Esq. of Tomatin, and L. 44 by the late iEneas Mac- 
bean, Esq. Junior of do. This is all the support the poor have ; and 
in bad years goes but a very little way. They are, however, gene- 
rally very unwilling to seek relief from the session, and they only 
ask it when necessitated to do so for the means of subsistence. 

Fairs. — There are seven fairs held in the parish, viz. six cattle 
trysts, being one during each of Ihe summer and autumn months, 
and one lamb market, on the third Friday of August. These are 
held at the Inn of Freeburn, which is situated about the middle of 
the parish, and are generally well attended by dealers, — the time for 
holding them being regulated so as to suit the dealers, vhen on 
their return from the great northern markets. 

Inns. — There are three inns in the parish ; two of the houses are 
good, and the third merely a dram-house. They are all on the line 
of the Highland road, and are in summer well supported, — the num- 
ber of travellers being then great. These are of no advantage certain- 
ly to the morals of the people, but they are not productive of much 
evil ; the country people do not frequent them much, and drunken 
quarrels are rare, except perhaps at markets. 

Fuel— The common fuel used is peats. These are found in abun- 
dance all over the parish, and ihe quality is as good as is to be found 
any where. They are cut in the end of May, and in the month of 
July are fit for carrying home and stacking. The expense of cutting is 
trifling,— about L.2, 10s. for a quantity which would supply a large 
family during the year; but there is the additional trouble of leading, 
which for that quantity would require ten days with three horses, 
bringing them from the distance of two miles. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In husbandry, there is no doubt the parish is susceptible of 
immense improvement. The soil is excellent, and all it wants is 



116 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



proper management. Lime is, however, expensive. Besides the 
carriage from Inverness or Strathspey, there is the expense of 
tolls ; and until this useful article is quarried within the parish, 
little can be expected. That it does exist within the parish 
is beyond a doubt ; but the property on which it has been found 
is under trust, and improvement requires the fostering hand of 
a resident landlord. A spirit of improvement is, however, rising 
up among the tenantry, and in a few years we hope to see a new 
system introduced. In fact, this is the only thing that can 
put a stop to emigration. Our young men, for want of employ- 
ment, are leaving us to seek their fortunes in America, and the old, 
whom prejudice has fixed in favour of old measures, are left to 
proceed in the routine pointed out by their ancestors, centuries 
ago. The young men can see the benefit of improvement, and can 
act upon it. They go to work in other parts of the country, and see 
the improvements carrying on there, and can apply them on their 
return ; but these are all leaving us for the new world, where, from 
the great and spirited improvements carrying on, they hope to better 
their fortunes. Emigration is so far useful as an outlet for our super- 
abundant population ; but the ease with which it is accomplished 
raises a spirit of discontent, and a desire of change in our people, 
which njakes them feel restless and uneasy in their present con- 
dition. The only true method of preventing it is by introducing 
a spirit of improvement among our tenantry ; and when this is met 
by the liberality of the landlord, we shall hope to see the popula- 
tion of our Highland glens comfortable and happy, and not wish- 
ing to change their native land for what they may suppose to be 
the comforts of a foreign soil.

PIIESBYTEUY OF ABERTARPH, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The parishes of Kilmalie and Kilmonivaig were an- 
ciently united, and called the parish of Lochaber; but they were 
disjoined upwards of two hundred years ago. The name Kilmalie • 
is evidently derived from a burying-ground consecrated to the Vir- 
gin Mary, — Kile signifying a burying-ground, and Malie being a 
diminutive for Mary, 

Extent. — The length from north-west to south-east is about 60 
miles; the greatest breadth 30 miles. It is bounded on the 
east and south-east by the parish of Kilmonivaig ; on the south- 
east by Rannoch, in Perthshire ; on the south and south-west by 
the parish of Appin ; on the west by the parishes of Morven and 
Ardnamurchan ; on the north by Glenelg. It lies partly in Inver- 
ness-shire, and partly in Argyllshire. 

Mountains. — The mountains are very numerous, but none of 
them deserves particular notice except Benevis, which is the highest 
mountain in Britain. It is situated near Fort William. Its height is 
4370 feet above the level of the sea, which lies within three-quarters 
of a mile from the base of this stupendous mass. The etymo- 
logy of this mountain has afforded a large field of conjecture ; but 
the writer is satisfied that the following is the true one ; Beinn in 
Gaelic signifies mountain neamh, the heavens or clouds ; and Ba- 
thais, that part of the human head which is between the forehead 
and the crown of the head. The compound word written in Gaelic 
would be Beinn-namli-bhathais. It is naturally enough contracted 
to Benivis, — the mountain loith its summit in the clouds, or, as in 
Pope's Homer, " cloud kissing hill." 

The view from the top of Benevis is very extensive ; but it is a 
Herculean labour to reach its top, and the attempt should not be 
made but by able bodied and healthy persons, with a proper guide. 

There are, in this parish, about sixty-seven miles of sea coast,

along which there are several spots of sandy arable land ; but not 
of any great extent. Wherever the mountains are high, the val- 
leys are narrow and the acclivity very steep. Where the mountains 
are not very high, the acclivity is more gentle, and the arable land 
extends farther from the shore ; one-third at least of the Very high 
hills are quite barren, and appear white at a distance. This is par- 
ticularly the case with respect to Benevis and the range of moun- 
tains to the east and west of it. Benevis differs from them all, not 
only by its height, but also by its round massy top. The deep clefts 
on the north-east side of Benevis are never without snow. For two 
seasons when ice failed, the snow gathered and condensed into ice 
• in these clefts, was of great sefrvice to the salmon-curers. The 
country peasants with their small hardy horses carried it down in 
panniers on horseback. 

Meteorology. — The atmosphere in general is moist, but not cold. 
The high mountains attract the clouds, which pour down torrents 
of rain in our valleys at all seasons ; hence the difficulty of rais- 
ing a corn crop in this climate. It requires the utmost skill and 
activity to secure crops in this country, particularly in late harvests. 
The wind blows in general from south and south-west. When it 
comes round to the west and north, it is an indication of the approach 
of fair weather ; with the south wind we have rain in general. In 
some seasons, there is a continuation of cold easterly wind for six or 
seven weeks, the effects of which are severely felt. The climate, 
upon the whole, is healthy. Rheumatism is a prevailing disease. 
There are persons at present in this parish bordering on a hundred 
years old. 

Hydrography. — There are three arms of the sea in this parish. 
The first and farthest south is Lochleven, which branches out from 
Linne Loch ten miles below Fort William, and penetrates between 
the lofty mountains of Glenco and Lochaber for ten or twelve miles 
towards Rannoch. It has two currents, one at Balachulish Ferry, 
the other about three miles farther up at Caolus-na-con. Linne 
Loch terminates at Fort William ; and then Locheil commences, 
being a continuation of Linne Loch, bending to the north-west at 
Fort William, and extending ten miles towards Arisaig and Skye. 
It has a current at Annat. Linne Loch has a strong current at 
Corran Ardgour Ferry. There is an excellent bay at Corran 
Ardgour, and another at Camus-na-gaul, near the south entrance 
of the Caledonian Canal, directly opposite to Fort William. 

Lakes and Rivers. — Locharkaig, which is sixteen miles long, and 



KILMALIE. 



119 



one broad, is the only fresh water lake of any consequence in this 
parish. Loch Lochy is chiefly in the parish of Kilmonivaig ; but 
about nine miles of its coast are in the parish of Kilnialie. It is on 
the line of the Caledonian Canal. The distance between it and 
Locharkaig is about a mile and a-half. The top of Achnacarry 
House, the seat of Locheil, is seen from Loch Lochy. There is 
a most beautiful valley between the two lakes, called in Gaelic cC 
mile dorch, or dark mile, being about a Scotch mile in length. It re- 
sembles the Trosachs between Loch Catherine and. Loch Auchray 
in Perthshire, but far surpasses the Trosachs in extent and in the 
beauty of the scenery. The dark mile commences at the farm- 
house of Clunes, and ends at Locharkaig. There is an excellent 
road through this truly picturesque valley. The river Lochy comes 
out of Loch Lochy, by a new channel cut out for it about 600 yards 
to the south of the line of the Caledonian Canal. It falls into the 
river Spean at Mucomre Bridge, and for a quarter of a mile it is 
called the Spean, but resumes its own name the Lochj', when it 
and the Spean fall into the old channel at Gearlochy. It runs 
eight miles, separating the parishes of Kilmalie and Kilmonivaig, 
and then falls into the sea at Fort William, where the water of 
Nevis also meets it. There is a ferry on this river about two miles 
from Fort William, having a good quay on either side, which is of 
very great use ; but since the roads are so good on both sides, and 
the intercourse increasing, the want of a substantial stone bridge is 
severely felt by travellers and cattle-dealers. It is to be hoped that 
the day is not distant when this want will be supplied. Steam-boat 
travellers would find great benefit from a bridge at Lochy Ferry, 
on account of the intercourse between Banvie Locks and Fort 
William. 

Geology. — The predominating rocks in this parish are gneiss 
and mica slate ; and subordinate to these are beds of quartz rock, 
hornblende rock, &amp;c. These various primitive rocks are traversed 
by rocks of granite, syenite, and porphyry. Rocks considered as 
belonging to the transition class also occur. The great Benevis 
is worthy the particular attention of the geologist, and, even in fine 
weather, will afford him many days of delightful and instructive 
employment. The lower part of the mountain is composed of 
mica slate and gneiss, higher up we meet with syenite, at a greater 
elevation granite ; the upper parts are composed of different va- 
rieties of porphyry. Many years ago Professor Jameson read an 
account of the geology of the mountain to the Wernerian Society ; 



120 



INVEllNESS-SHIRE. 



afterwards, an eloquent writer, the present Dr Macknlght of Edin- 
burgh, wrote a description of its scenery and geology, which was 
published in the Memoirs of the Wernerian Natural History So- 
ciety. Some years afterwards, Dr Macculloch, who set at nought 
every thing done by his predecessors, attempted, but unsuccess- 
fully, to make geologists believe that the mountain was unknown 
geologically till he set foot on it. Several foreign geologists also 
have published remarks on this, the highest mountain in Great 
Britain. 

Zoology. — Much attention is paid to the management of sheep 
farms in this parish, as well as in the neighbouring Highland pa- 
rishes. Wedders from extensive farms here, are considered in the 
south country markets, second only to wedders reared on the farm 
of Auch in Glenorchy, on the Marquis of Breadalbane's propertv. 
Goats are scarcely known now in this parish. They are very de- 
structive to oak wood. 

Salmon, herrings, red-cod, lythe, skate, flounders, whitings are 
found in the salt water lakes. Formerly, salmon were found in 
Locharkaig ; but a cascade at Mucomre Bridge has cut up the com- 
munication between the sea and Locharkaig, so that no salmon is 
now to be found where they abounded of old. This is one disad- 
vantage which has followed the making of the Caledonian Canal. 

Woods and Plantations. — There was a very extensive and ex- 
cellent wood on Mr Cameron of Lochiel's property ; but much of 
it was cut down about twenty years ago. There is still remaining, 
on the south side of Locharkaig, a considerable quantity of excel- 
lent fir, and of great size. On Lochiel and Ardgour's properties 
there is a good deal of oak wood, and kept in the best order, par- 
ticularly by Colonel M'Lean of Ardgour, who is enthusiastically 
fond of wood. He has several spots planted with fir, well enclos- 
ed, which no doubt will be profitable hereafter. In the meantime, 
it is a great ornament to the country. 

H. — Civil History. 

This parish was a nursery for the army, particularly in the late 
war. There is a good deal of tradition relative to events which 

" There is an obelisk erected in this parish. It has the following inscription, 
which is given at length, as it indicates the character and achievements of an eminent 
individual connected with this parish : — " Sacred to the memory of Colonel John 
Cameron, eldest son of Sir Ewen Cameron of Fassfern, Baronet, whose mortal remains 
transported from the field of glory, where he died, rest here with those of his fore- 
fathers. During twenty years of active military service, with a spirit which knew no 
fear, and shunned no danger, he accompanied or led, in marches, sieges, and battles, the 
gallant 92d Regiment of Scottish Highlanders, always to honour, almost always to vie-

took place in this parish during the rebellion of 1745. Lochiel hav- 
ing joined Prince Charles, Clan Cameron followed their chief, a mea- 
sure of which they had sufficient cause to repent. The royal army, 
after the Prince was finally defeated at Culloden, 'pitched their 
camp at Fort Augustus, and sent plundering parties to Lochaber, 
who drove away all the cattle in the country, burnt the houses, and 
drove the miserable inhabitants, old and young, without food or 
clothing, to the hills. They killed several persons in cold blood. 
About 400 of the royal army, passing up Locharkaig side, found a 
young man of the name of Cameron, having a gun in his possession. 
Without civil or military trial, the unfortunate youth was posted 
up and shot, by an order from Grant of Knoc-ceanach, who com- 
manded a party of the Ross-shire militia. Dugal Roy Cameron, 
the incensed father of the slain youth, watched the party as they 
were returning with their plunder. Grant of Knoc-ceanach, whe- 
ther designedly or not, gave his horse to Major Munro of Culcairn ; 
and Dugal, mistaking his man, shot the amiable major. Dugal es- 
caped, after throwing away the discharged musket. He got again 
before the party, and took his stand in a narrow pass, with the 
view of doing more execution ; but the party were so long detained, 

that they escaped without meeting their incensed enemy again ; 

but he taught them not to come back on a similar expedition. There 
was no more burning or plundering in Lochaber, though a party of 
the royal army were quartered for years at the head of Locharkaig. 
Dugal Roy Cameron was never discovered. He served afterwards 
as a private in the royal army. Many of his connections are still 
in this country. 

Land-oio7icrs.—T\ie land-owners in this parish are, Mr Came- 
ron of Lochiel; Colonel M'Lean of Ardgour; Sir Duncan Came- 
ron of Fassfern, Bart.; Mr Patrick Cameron of Glenevis ; and Mr 
John Cameron of Berbice.

but has been very irregularly kept, — partly owing to the scattered 
state of the parish, and partly owing to the number of Episcopa- 
lians and Roman Catholics in the parish, who do not record the 
names of their children in the parish register. 

Modern Buildings. — The only modern building of consequence 
in this parish is Lochiel's mansion-house at Achnacarry, the an- 
cient family seat. The house is a large, handsome, and substan- 
tial building, but it is not yet finished. Colonel M'Lean of Ard- 
gour's house was burnt some years ago, and has been since rebuilt 
and enlarged. It is situate near Corran Ferry, and surrounded 
with planting and shrubbery laid out with great taste. 

III. — Population. 

In 1753, the population was , 3093 

1792, . . 4225 

1801, . . 4600 

1811, . . 5000 

1821, . . 5527 

1831, . . 4210 

The people employed on the Caledonian Canal are included in 
the census of 1811 and 1821 ; but if the census of 1831 had been 
correctly taken, the population would certainly have been found to 
be more than 4210, notwithstanding of the number that left the 
country when the Canal was finished. 

In 1831, there was in the Inverness part of the parish, . 2745 souls, 

in Argyleshire, .... 1465 
families in Inverness-shire, . • • 457 
in Argyleshire, . . • 230 
males in Inverness-shire, 1340, females in ditto, 1405. 
males in Argyleshire, 725, females in ditto, 740. 

About 1200 reside in the village of Fort William, which is situat- 
ed in Inverness-shire. The yearly average of births cannot be as- 
certained on account of the number of Episcopalians and Roman 
Catholics in the parish. There is no register of burials kept. The 
yearly average of marriages for seven years may be about 30. The 
number of children in each family at an average is 3. There 
are 610 inhabited houses. 

Language, Sfc. — The prevailing language is the Gaelic, but the 
English is gaining ground. The people are very desirous to ac- 
quire the English language. When one person wishes evil to an- 
other, it is not uncommon to hear a Highlander say, " Don beurla 
orta," i. e. may you never speak properly in English. The inter- 
course with the south country by steam-boats, and the number of 
schools in particular, have tended to spread the English language 
among the inhabitants; but they prefer to receive rehgious in- 



KILMALIE. 



123 



struction in Gaelic ; indeed, many of them who can speak in com- 
mon conversation in English cannot follow an English discourse. 

The rising generation imitate their equals in the south country 
in their dress. Tartan among men, and cotton cloth among women, 
are the common costume. 

The common diet of the peasants is potatoes, with herrings or 
milk. Such as are in better circumstances may have a little meal 
and mutton ; but potatoes is their principal food for three-fourths 
of the year. 

Smuggling and poaching are still carried on secretly, but not to 
any great extent. When the proprietors are absent from the coun- 
try' for any length of time, idle persons use liberty with the game 
on their property. 

IV. — Industry. 

There is not much arable land in this parish, so that the people 
are employed chiefly as fishers or shepherds ; neither is there any 
cotton or woollen manufactory. There is one bank agent at Fort 
William ; and about twenty merchants between Fort William and 
Corpach. There are three medical gentlemen at Fort William, four 
lawyers, and a Sheriff-substitute. There is a sufficient number of 
carpenters, masons, shoemakers, and tailors, between Fort Wil- 
liam and Corpach, to supply the wants of the parish and adjacent 
country. ' 

Agriculture. — There is not one acre out of 300 cultivated or 
capable of cultivation in this parish. Considerable exertions have 
been made by some of the proprietors to drain and improve por- 
tions of land near their own residence j and wherever the attempt 
has been made, the returns have fully repaid the expenses. 

Bent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is about 
L. 1, lOs. per acre ; the average rent for grazing a cow is L. 2 per 
annum ; the rate per ewe is from 2s. to 3s. per annum. 

Qiiarries. — There is a slate quarry on Lochiel's property at 
north Balachulish ; but it has not been much wrought hitherto. 
There is also a stone quarry at Fassfern, which was of great advan- 
tage at the time of making the Caledonian Canal, and lately in 
building a quay at Fort William. 

Fisheriei.~'Ss\mon and herring are the principal fisheries in this 
parish. The river Lochy is famed for the excellency of its salmon. 
There are stake-nets in several places along the coast, and extra- 
ordinary exertions are making to improve the sahnon-fishing. Time 
will tell how the present speculation will pay the adventurers, but 



124 



INVERNESS-SHIUE. 



no expense is spared to insure success. The herring-fishing is 
the great source of support to the country people; but when it fails, 
they are destitute, particularly in the village of Fort- William. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Fort William is a market-town ; but the market-day is scarcely 
distinguished from another day, so little business is doing. The 
village of Corpach, at the south end of the Caledonian Canal, is 
the only other village in the parish. There are no houses of any 
value in Corpach, and there is no appearance at present of any 
improvement. 

Means of Communication. — There is a regular communication 
with Inverness and Glasgow by steam in summer twice a-week, and 
in winter once a-week, besides a daily post from the south and from 
Inverness ; also three times a week to and from Arisaig. There 
is a penny post-office established lately at Corpach. 

Caleclo7iia.n Canal. — The south end of this stupendous work be- 
gins at Corpach in this parish, and runs eight miles through it 
along the river Lochy to Loch Lochy. It was a work long in con- 
templation before it was begun. It occupied about twenty years from 
its commencement to its completion, and it cost nearly a million 
of money to the nation. No one can yet say how useful it may 
prove ; but already it has attracted thousands of travellers, British 
and foreign. The number is increasing every year ; and the steam 
navigation is improving and increasing in proportion, to meet the 
wishes of travellers and traders. All admire the magnificent scene- 
ry along its banks for sixty miles, but particularly at the south en- 
trance, from whence the traveller has a full view of Benevis. The 
only disappointment to which the traveller can be exposed is, that 
the monarch mountain may be in a mournful mood, — half co- 
vered with mist. To escape this disappointment, travellers should 
visit the scenery in the months of June, July, and August, when 
they have every chance of seeing the mountain free of clouds and 
mist, but never free of snow. 

Every encouragement should be given by the Honourable Com- 
missioners to the navigation of the Caledonian Canal. At present, 
the Greenock merchants complain of the high dues, notwithstand- 
ing that these dues have been reduced one-half from what they 
were at first. The consequence is, that vessels which would other- 
wise pass through the canal, are sent round the north coast. The 
steam-boats, in particular, ought to be encouraged ; and were a tug 
boat allowed to pass /ree, in order to expedite the navigation on 



KILMALIE. 



125 



the canal, there is reason to expect that more dues would be drawn. 
The same number of men are employed waiting the locks as if 
there were vessels passing every hour of the day ; since these men 
are in Government pay, and since overseers, &amp;c. are also in Govern- 
ment pay, every facility and encouragement should be given to 
steam-boats and other vessels to pass through the canal. 

The only harbour of consequence in this parish is at Fort Wil- 
liam. A quay has been recently built there, partly by the Fishery 
Commissioners and partly by private subscription. It is expected 
to be of some benefit to the place, if indeed any thing can benefit 
a place without any public or private employment for a poor and 
numerous population. There is a very safe anchorage at Camus- 
nagaul, between Corpach and Fort William. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is at Corpach, at the 
south entrance of the Caledonian Canal, which is the most cen- 
trical spot in the whole parish. There is a population of from 
500 to 600 souls within three miles of the church. It is distant 
about thirty-six miles from the extremity of the parish, and was built 
in 1783 for L. 440. It will accommodate about 900 or 1000 sit- 
ters. All the seats are free, which is an immense advantage to a 
poor population. It removes a common excuse for absence from 
church. The manse and its appendages of garden and oflke- 
houses were built about seventeen years ago, and cost the heritors 
triple of what the church cost them in 1783. The glebe is large, 
partly arable and partly pasture, but not valuable, on account of 
its unprotected and fenceless state, in the immediate neighbourhood 
of many poor cottagers. The stipend is not fixed, as there is only 
an interim decreet. The living, upon the whole, is considered re- 
spectable. 

There is a missionary at Fort William; and a church that can ac- 
commodate 300. The Society in Scotland for Propagating Christ- 
ian knowledge allow L. 50 per annum to the missionary ; and the 
Duke of Gordon, while proprietor of Fort William and neighbour- 
ing land, allowed L. 10 per annum for house rent. The place is at 
present vacant. 

There are two Government churches in this parish, one on each 
side of Linne Loch near Corran Ferry : one minister preaching 
every alternate Sabbath in each supplies both. There is a popu- 
lation of upwards of 1100 souls connected with his charge ; and the 
place was very destitute before the Government church was erect- 
ed. There was a missionary for some time officiating between. 



126 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



Locharkaig in this parish, and Brae Roy, in the parish of Kihuo- 
nivaig; but he was obhged to resign on account of bad health. He 
had not a place of residence within the bounds of his charge. The 
preaching stations four in number assigned to him were so dis- 
tant from one another, and some of them so difficult of access, as 
to make his labours difficult for himself, and of less value to the 
people. This mission is at present vacant. There is a popula- 
tion of 220 souls in the district of Locharkaig. The nearest part 
of this district is eleven miles, and the remotest part thirty -six 
miles from the parish church. 

There is an Episcopalian and a Roman Catholic chapel at Fort 
William, each having an officiating ecclesiastic. The number of 
Episcopalians in the whole parish is about 400, and of Roman 
Catholics about 200. The Established Churches at Kilmalie 
and at Fort William are so crowded every Sabbath day, that, from 
the aspect of the congregation, a stranger would conclude there 
could be no other sect in the parish, but that the whole body of 
the people belonged to the Established Church. The average 
number of communicants in the Established Church is about 
800. 

There is a Bible Society at Fort William, and a Religious As- 
sociation at Kilmalie. The probable average amount of the con- 
tribution yearly for both may be about L. 20 or L. 24. 

Education. — There are eleven schools in the whole parish: 
one, a parochial school, at Fort William,— the salary the maxi- 
mum ; six schools supported by different societies, of which three 
are supported by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge ; four schools supported by private individuals. The branches 
generally taught in the parochial school and in that supported by 
the Committee of the General Assembly at Corpach, are English 
reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, book-keeping, geogra- 
phy- 

The fees of the parochial school may amount to about L. 50 
per annum ; but the teacher has to pay an assistant. The Society 
schoolmaster's income may be from L. 16 to L. 25 per annum, in- 
cluding school-fees, which are not well paid in general. The Gaelic 
schools have conferred no small benefit on this parish. They have 
been instrumental in introducing the word of God into families 
where it was not before ; and the teachers in general being per- 
sons of a serious cast of mind, have been a check upon the prevail- 
ing sins of drunkejiness, swearing, and Sabbath profanation. 



KILMALIE. 



127 



Libraries. — There are two libraries at Fort William, one lite- 
rary, the other religious ; but no great demand for books from ei- 
ther of them. There is a good selection of books in each of them, 
but the frequent changes and vacancies in the mission of Fort 
William is against the taste for reading religious books ; and the 
numerous spirit-shops in that village, and in other parts of the pa- 
rish, prove a great snare to those who ought to employ their time 
in reading. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor may 
be about 1 60, chiefly supported by collections at the church door, 
with occasional donations from heritors, and alms received by their 
going from house to house through the parish. The most needy re- 
ceive Is. per week; but the average given to ordinary paupers 
may be from 5s. to 7s. in the year. The people are very kind 
to such as are in distress. They send potatoes, milk, peats, &amp;c. to 
their houses. Some are very anxious to get upon the poors' list ; 
but others abstain from applying for aid as long as possible. 

Prison. — There is no prison in this parish. The garrison of 
Fort William is used as a place of temporary confinement till the 
accused be liberated or sent to Inverness or to Inverary jail. 

Fairs. — There are two annual fairs at Fort William, one about 
the 13th of June, the other about the 13th of November, — both 
well attended, and considerable business transacted at each. 

Inns. — There are three inns in the parish ; and dram-houses 
without number, — some of them licensed to sell spirits, some selling 
without license.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHCARRON, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER BEITH, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Glenelg is the ancient and modern name, derived from 
or compounded of Gleann and seilg, or ffleannand elid ; in the for- 
mer case signifying the valley of hunting, in the latter the valley of 
the roe, — both equally appropriate, whether meant to be descriptive 
of the regular and extensive sweep of the mountains, or of the rich 
verdure and covert by which they are distinguished. 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish is about 20 miles in length, 
and the same nearly in breadth, bounded on the N. E. and E. by the 
parish of Glensheal, county of Ross; on the S. E. and S. by Glen- 
garry and Lochaber ; on the S. W. by lake Morar, separating it 
from Ardnamurchan ; and on the W. and N. W. by the sound of 
Sleat, separating it from the Isle of Skye. The coast runs nearly 
from N. to S. and, excepting in the bay of Glenelg, and within the 
lochs or arms of the sea hereafter to be mentioned, where good 
anchoring ground is to be met with, is generally high and rocky. 

Climate, Sfc. — In common with other parts of the north-west 
coast of Scotland, Glenelg is remarkable for the quantity of rain 
which falls at all seasons of the year. The prevailing winds are 
the west and south-west, which convey the clouds from the Atlantic 
heavily laden with treasures, which are most plentifully dispensed by 
them as they travel along and come in contact with the summits of 
our lofty mountains. Our severest gales are from those quarters, 
and are in winter, especially at night, accompanied by frequent peals 
of terrific thunder. North-east, east and south-east winds bring 
dry weather, particularly the two latter ; but they are of rare oc- 
currence. Our storms usually commence with a strong, gusty, but 
dry, gale from the south-east, which after a time almost instantan- 
eously veers to the south-west ; from which quarter it rages with 
fury, accompanied with torrents of incessant rain. The usual prog- 
nostic of those storms is the low and sullen flight of the sea birds

through the valleys into the interior of the country, as if they re- 
treated from the advance of a resistless enemy. Notwithstanding- 
the excessive moisture of the climate the inhabitants of the country 
are singularly healthy. 

Hrjdrographj. — The parish is intersected by two arms of the sea, 
Loch Hourn and Lochnevis, and is thus divided into three districts, 
Glenelg Proper, Knodyart, and North Morar. Loch Hourn is navi- 
gable for twenty miles, being about five broad at the entrance, 
which breadth it retains for about one-half its extent, when, for 
the remainder, it contracts into less than half this. Lochnevis 
also extends about twenty miles, being in point of breadth much 
of the same description as the former. Both are remarkable for 
the romantic beauty of the scenery of their coasts, especially Loch- 
Hourn. The mountains rise from their margin, and are covered 
with wood. 

As in all parts of the Highlands, so here many fresh water lakes 
are to be met with, supplied with trout ; but nothing in the na- 
tural history of any of them requires particular notice. ' The same 
remark applies to the rivers which, along the coast, empty them- 
selves into the friths. 

Soil, c— The soil in Glenelg Proper is loamy and fertile, not- 
withstanding the quantity of rain which falls. By this, however, 
the average weight of the grain is necessarily much deteriorated • 
yet it is no unusual thing for the common bear or big to weigh fifty 
pounds imperial bushel, and Flemish oats forty-eight pounds. In 
the district of Knodyart the soil is much lighter, but good crops 
are raised, with the advantage of a harvest always two weeks earlier 
than in Glenelg Proper. 

Mineralogy.— eA of limestone are met with in various parts 
of the parish, but it is burned neither for building nor for agricul- 
tural purposes. This may be accounted for by the rockeino- 
of a very hard description, and by the want of suitable fuel. Peal 
would hardly suffice for the purpose, and the expense of coals, it is 
supposed, would be greater than the benefit derived from the use of 
lime could compensate. An excellent substitute is found in the 
shells J It abounds on the coast, and is obtained at the expense of 
the conveyance. Plumbago also is to be met with in considerable 
quantity The rocks of this parish, as Professor Jameson informs 
us, are chiefly gneiss, with subordinate mica slate, quartz rock, horn- 
blende rock, granite, syenite, and serpentine. The serpentine af-

fords veins of asbestus and also of amianthus ; actynolite, zoisite, 
and tremolite occur in other rocks. 

Fishinffs.— The sea along the coast, and the various lochs branch- 
ing off from it, have long been famed for the number and quality 
of herrings frequenting them ; but, of late years, the 6shing has 
failed, as on all the west coast of Scotland, to the impoverishment 
of a large population who subsisted by it. Other fish are caught 
to the extent used by those employed in taking them, and the sup- 
ply required by the country,— the prevalent kinds being ling and 
cod ; but few, if any, are exported. 

Vood. A considerable quantity of natural oak, ash, birch, alder, 

&amp;c. grows in the glens and on the sides of the mountains, which 
overhang the lochs by which the parish is intersected. One or 
two instances, on a small scale, of plantations made at a remote 
period, also show that hard woods generally, but the ash and plane 
particularly, are the trees most congenial to the soil and climate. 
About twenty years ago, considerable tracts of land were laid un- 
der larch, pine, and spruce, intermingled with oak and ash, by Mr 
Bruce, then proprietor of Glenelg Proper, all which have grown 
well. As these plantations have been laid out with admirable taste, 
they add in a great degree to the beauty of scenery, otherwise of a 
high order. Mr Bruce, at the same time, expended a considerable 
sum of money in the formation of an orchard near the opening of 
the larger glen of the district, which he sheltered from the prevail- 
ing winds by quick growing wood, and supplied with every descrip- 
tion of fruit tree, and of rare and valuable plant : but, being secured 
only by a temporary dry stone dike, and common thorn hedge, and 
he himself ceasing soon after to reside in the country, it became a 
prey to depredators of various kinds, and consequently suffered loss. 
Still, however, the large fruit trees, especially the pear and plum, 
yield good crops ; and the orchard, even thus wasted, with its mag- 
nificent beech hedge running throughout its whole length— for one- 
half the way being double, so as to form a sheltered and shaded 
walk of considerable extent— and with its parallel hnes of graceful 
silver firs closely planted, running across its whole breadth,— con- 
stitutes a striking object in the scenery of this, one of the first of 
Highland glens. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-oivners— The landowners of the parish are three in num- 
ber : The Right Honourable Baron Glenelg of Glenelg, present 
Secretary of State for the Colonies, proprietor of Glenelg Proper,

JEneas Ranaldson Macdonell, Esq. of Clanranald and Glengar- 
ry, proprietor of Knodyart, bounded on the north by Loch-Hourn, 
on the south by Lochnevis ,• and T. A. Eraser, Esq. of Lovat, pro- 
prietor of North Morar, bounded on the north by Lochnevis, and 
on the south by Lake Morar. 

Eminent Men. — Lord Glenelg, late Mr Charles Grant, eminent 
no less for his literary taste than for his talents and success as a 
statesman, both being graced and sanctified by his unostentatious 
and unfeigned piety, has a place in the history of his country, as 
one of those great men who, in the capacity of rulers, have been 
raised up in the time of her need. The early period in his pub- 
lic hfe, at which he was called to take a share in the councils of 
the nation, — the anxiety of each successive government to secure 
the benefit of his valuable services, — shews the estimation in which 
he has been uniformly held by those best able to judge of his 
character; and the master-hand with which he has conducted each 
department of the state entrusted to his care, with his consequent 
progressive advancement in public confidence, proves that he has 
not been overrated. His Lordship's Parliamentary career has been 
from the beginning connected with Inverness-shire, first, as the Re- 
presentative of that district of burghs of which Inverness is the 
principal, and subsequently, of the county, — on the death of his 
father, whom he succeeded, — until his elevation to the Peerage 
The services he has rendered his country are well known. For 
three years, he held the Secretaryship of Ireland, which country he 
governed with great prudence and popularity. In the course of this 
period he obtained for Ireland, the benefit of measures which it 
required no ordinary sagacity to devise, boldness to advocate, and 
labour to carry into effect. As President of the Board of Trade, 
at a subsequent period, it fell to him to introduce that measure 
for the protection of the corn interests the most intricate of sub- 
jects which still forms the law of the kingdom, on a point so im- 
portant,— none better to supersede it having hitherto been devis- 
ed. As head of another department, it also fell to him to pre- 
pare and bring forward the new law for our East India dominions, 
—an act affecting so large a portion of the human race, and which,' 
m the face of opposing interests and able adversaries, was passed, 
without any change in its material parts, with general approbation. 
And m his new and extended sphere, similar important and be- 
neficial results may well be anticipated, from the exercise of his 



132

high and energetic talents, the influence of which will not ultimate- 
ly prove the less availing that, from natural taste, the notoriety of 
public exhibition seems to be avoided rather than courted by him. 

Antiquities. — Under this head the parish can boast of the most 
entire specimens, in the southern parts of the Highlands, of the 
ancient Beorgs, Burghs, or Dunes, usually called Pictish Towers. 
They are two in number, and situated near each other in Glenbeg, 
the smaller of the two valleys to which the name Glenelg belongs 
in common. The foundation and ruins of a third are also seen 
in this, and part of the materials of what must have been two more, 
in the larger, valley or Glenmore. Affording too convenient a 
supply of useful stones for modern architecture, scarcely one-half 
of the original building, even of the most entire, remains ; whilst 
of the others little else is to be found than that portion of the ma- 
terials which it would have been useless to remove. They are all 
situated at no great distance from the sea, and, it has been alleg- 
ed, decidedly within the ancient Scandinavian boundar}'. The 
height of those of which a portion remains is about 30 feet ; but 
they probably were several feet higher. The diameter within walls 
is also about 30 feet, but above 50 outside, or over walls. Within, 
the building is perpendicular, but the external wall is curved, bul- 
ging out at top after the form, but not to the extent, of the Ed- 
dyston Light-house. This, with their circular shape, and their hav- 
ing no opening on the outside wall, the building, though without 
mortar of any kind, being, at the same time, so closely jointed that 
no footing could have been had in any attempt at scaling, shows 
that the " towers" certainly were places of refuge and defence. 
The walls are double, and exceed 10 feet in thickness. Between 
or within the walls are tiers of galleries, respectively about 6 feet 
high and 2| wide. One of the dunes which we describe has four 
such tiers, of the dimensions stated, one over the other. The se- 
cond has only two whose dimensions approach this, the high- 
er galleries contracting almost to a single wall. The access to 
the galleries was by openings, left for the purpose, inside the 
du7ie, about 3 feet wide, and 5 high, — the communication of each 
tier with the other being by an aperture in the floor above, or 
rather by a gap in the large flags which, stretching across both 
walls, bind the building firmly together, and form the floor of each 
successive gallery. The external entrance to these places of re- 
fuge and defence was by a very low door, close to the ground, to 
pass through which it is necessary to creep on the hands and knees: 



GLENELG. 



133 



As this entrance still remains, in the case of one of the dunes, it is 
evident, from the construction, that a single stone dropped, after the 
manner of a portcullis, from the opening between the double walls, 
must have formed a barrier which no intruder could force. In 
some instances of similar erections, the external entrance is said 
to have been subterraneous ; and it is true that a passage of this 
kind from one of the Glenelg towers was shut up a few years ago, 
by the farmers in the neighbourhood, the loss which they sustain- 
ed by sheep and cattle falling into it having led to this. The 
passage never was explored by any of the existing generation ; but 
the tradition is, that it communicated both with the neighbouring 
river and the second tower. 

It is probable that the dwelling-houses of the inhabitants, in the 
troublous times which gave origin to the structures which we have 
attempted to describe, were erected close by the hurghs or dunes, 
and that when the lighting of the beacons on the neighbourino- 
mountains, gave intimation of the approach of an enemy, or his de- 
scent on the coast, they forsook their habitations, conveyed their 
moveable property, with provisions, within the walls of the fortress, 
if not always kept there, and, having previously driven their cattle off 
from the coast, or dispersed them over the mountains, awaited the 
event or prepared for defence. The protection afforded by such 
strongholds, usually built upon eminences, must have been consi- 
derable. The galleries described above provided perfect shelter for 
women and children, from arrows and other missiles, which mio-ht 
be thrown into the fort; for they do not seem to have been roofed 
over. The form of the dune precluded the prospect of capture by 
scahng : whilst from the summit, where, from the projecting stones 
Avhich remain, it is evident there must have been some description 
of platform, the besieged could hurl destruction on the enemy who, 
either by this means or the battering-ram, sought their ruin'. 
From the construction of the castles, and the nature of the assaults 
made by the predatory adventurers, for defence against whom they 
were intended, it must have seldom occurred that they were taken 
by an enemy, unless by surprise. The generally received opi- 
nion of their origin is, that they were not the workmanship of any 
purely Celtic tribe, there being many circumstances to render it 
probable that they were erected by the Danes or Norwegians. It 
IS necessary only to state further, that the stones, large and small, 
with which those of Glenelg are built, were conveyed a distance 
of more than a mile, from a neighbouring mountain, of which the 



134

proof is, — the traces of the transportation afforded by those drop- 
ped by the way. 

The tradition accounting for the erection of the dunes is sufficient- 
ly wild. According to this, they were built by two giants, of sta- 
ture and strength so immense, that one placing himself at a con- 
venient distance, between the mountain from which the materials 
were quai'ried, and the site on which the duneS are reared, handed 
the stones to his companion, who without further trouble, construct- 
ed the fabrics in all the magnitude in which, it is said, they once 
appeared. As evidence and illustration of the powers of this Ti- 
tanic race, a huge rock, of at least fifty tons, is shown as a missile 
which the one brother hurled at the other, on an occasion when 
detected by him, in the act- of carrying off from his castle the fire 
which he had left on the hearth on going forth to the chase. The 
straits of Kyle Bhea and Kyle Akin, separating Skye at two points 
from the mainland, are said to bear their names, because their 
usual mode of passage was by leaping over them. In confirmation 
of the whole history, their place of sepulture, for they perished in 
war at last, was long shown and is still distinguished by the name 
of " Imear nam Fear Mora." That we may be accurate in our 
history, it may be proper to add, that one account bears, that 
Rhea perished by drowning, according to the following distich : — 

Ijeum gach Fear air ceaiui a shleagh, 
Is dhuirich Mac Rhea 'sa chaol. 

The " barrow" or tumulus distinguished by the foregoing name 

is situated in a little plain near Kyle Rhea. Superstition had long 
attached sacredness to the spot, and predicted wrath from above on 
the intruder who, with unhallowed hands, should force it to reveal 
its secret. Several years ago, however, a party of gentlemen con- 
nected with the country resolved to brave the danger ; and proceed- 
ed, but with selection of a cloudless day, to put tradition to the test. 
For a time all went well ; but their task was only half completed and 
the wished-for discovery but half made, when the sky became sud- 
denly overcast, and a thunder storm of unusual character compelled 
them to desist, and to restore matters, so far as might be, to their 
previous condition. They had, however, in their search come upon 
two sarcophagi, formed of large flags, containing the remains of 
human skeletons, imbedded in the finest sand, of most extraordinary 
size. The bones on being exposed to the air, soon crumbled into 
dust; but an idea of their dimensions is well given by an eye-witness, 
who states, that when the under jaw-bone of one of the skeletons was 



GLENELG. 



135 



applied around the lower part of the face of a very large and fat 
man present, it could so be held without touching- him; being at the 
extreme points nearly twelve inches apart. The circumstances at- 
tending the exhumation long secured to " Imear navn Fear Mora" 
an immunity denied to the adjacent locality. But the lapse of time 
brought it at last into the occupation of those, who were strangers 
to the impression produced by such a cause. An attempt was made 
to subdue the stubborn soil. Warnings of most portentous cast 
were given, but the sturdy agriculturist, nothing daunted, pursued 
his task, and the traces of the peaceful plough have now rendered 
it difficult to point out the site of the " gigantic heroes' resting- 
place." 

M a7ision- House.— r-The only mansion-house in the parish, is that 
of Inverie, on Glengarry's Knodyart property, where he now re- 
sides. It is beautifully situated on the banks of Lochnevis, and was 
built by the late Colonel Macdonell, father of the present proprie- 
tor, who has been described as the last of that class of Highland 
Chiefs, of whom he formed so perfect a specimen in all his feelings 
and habits. The house is remarkable, inasmuch as the two prin- 
cipal rooms are finished with strong wattle work from the floor to 
the roof-tree, for there is no cieling. The couples which support 
the fabric are of native fir, of great strength and size, also rising 
from the ground and meeting in massive arches over-head. The 
floor is of clay and hard sand, the whole finishing being truly Cel- 
tic, and in excellent keeping with the tartans which grace its hos- 
pitable and accomplished inmates. 

In Knodyart and Glenelg Proper, there are several large and 
comfortable houses, occupied by extensive sheep -farmers. Of 
those the principal are at Barrisdale, Beolary, and Ellanreach. 
The last especially is commodious, well finished, and finely situat- 
ed near the sea.

The ancient population must have been very considerable, pro- 
bably double at least of what it is now. The decrease is to be ac- 
counted for solely by emigration ; for to such an extent has this 
prevailed, that America too rejoices in a Glenelg, with a popu- 
lation, at least equal to that which the parent parish still possesses. 
This emigration was at first of necessity and not of choice. The 



136 



INVEUNESS-SHIRE. 



letting of large tracts of land to single individuals caused the ori- 
ginal banishment of the hardy and numerous race, who had for so 
many generations possessed the soil. This class of emigrants did 
not quit their native shores empty-handed. On the contrary, they 
carried with them the means of procuring a comfortable home be- 
yond the Atlantic. The population which remained consisted of 
those who were too poor to follow, and of a few others, who, wil- 
ling to forego some advantages for the privilege of residing in their 
much loved native land, tried to content themselves with sadly re- 
duced possessions, until, finding that thus they were losing their all, 
and induced by the flattering tidings which reached them from the 
western continent, they too, though in different circumstances from 
their predecessors, bade farewell to a country, to which they had 
clung till they could do so no longer. Of this description of in- 
habitants few that is, not more than a dozen families, are left be- 
hind ; and of those, as they are able to effect their object, occa- 
sional families take their flight to what they consider a happier 
shore. Besides the tacksmen of the large possessions into which 
the country has been divided, — four of whom possess Glenelg Pro- 
per, and about as many more the other districts, — besides them and 
the shepherds and servants whom they require, the population con- 
sists of those who dwell in villages near the sea ; — divided into two 
classes, — such as possess from one acre, to perhaps six of arable 
ground, and the grazing of from one to three cows, and others who 
have nothing but the cottage that shelters them, who depend on 
the kindness of neighbours for patches of ground for potatoes, and 
supply all their other wants by fishing, and such work as they 
may obtain at home or abroad. It is but fair to remark, that the 
banishment of the original population, and the throwing of the 
country into a few large possessions, took place long before the 
time of the present race of proprietors, so that, whether matter of 
regret or satisfaction, to them belongs neither the blame nor praise. 
Whatever the views of political economists on this interesting topic, 
as to the nation's loss or gain, it is impossible not to contemplate 
it in reference to those exiles themselves, and, in doing this, not 
to lament, especially, over the injury sustained by them in a 
moral point of view. Amidst the plenty for their bodily support 
which they enjoy in America, they dwell there in a barren wil- 
derness as to provision for their souls. Deprived of the ordinances 
of religion, or but scantily and occasionally supplied, deprived also 
of the means of instruction for their children, the many careless

and indifferent who go thither become confirnned in their spiritual 
deadness, whilst those of them who quit their native land under 
more serious impressions, also yield to the secularising influence of 
such an order of things; and though they retain their integrity, and 
hold fast their profession in their day, yet, leaving no successors, 
the harps which for a time had awakened echoes, that previously 
enjoyed an unbroken sleep, are at last hung upon the willows, 
and the Songs of Zion cease to be heard by the streams of the fo- 
reign land  How worthy this subject of the consideratiou of a pa- 
triotic and parental Legislature  Nay, how imperative that the 
thousands who yearly go to swell the population of our growing co-

Language. — Glenelg being a purely Highland district, the lan- 
guage spoken is almost exclusively Gaelic. A few individuals un- 
derstand a little English, and are able to speak it;, but Gaehc is 
the language in which all business is transacted, and will probably 
long continue to be so. Here, as throughout the whole High- 
lands, there exists the greatest ambition for the acquirement of 
English. Without it, it is well known there is little probability 
of advancing in the world ; but from the system pursued in our 
schools, the progress hitherto made in introducing English has 
been limited indeed. The disadvantages under which our High- 
land population labour in acquiring knowledge from this cause, 
are unspeakable ; and it were well worthy of those whose atten- 
tion is now directed to the subject of training teachers for the 
duties of their important office, to take into consideration the ob- 
stacle which has to be overcome in reference to our Highland 
youth, and to devise the mode by which this may be fairly expect- 
ed to be done. The simple reading of English is easily taught ; 
but the difficulty lies in making this language the medium of com- 
munication with the minds of our youth. If children who under- 
stand English require what is called the intellectual system, i. e. the 
translation of complex into simple terms, Highlanders require a 
double translation ; this, and also the second rendering into their 
mother tongue ; and all, moreover, with the aim of ultimately sub- 
stituting the more for the less perfect language. 

With ordinary advantages the population of this parish might 
certainly be much raised in the scale of intelligence, being natu- 
rally remarkably acute, shrewd, and active. With this character, 



138

and enjoying the facilities which they do in the more remote dis- 
tricts, it is not be wondered that smuggling should prevail to some 
extent, in the pursuit of which their ingenuity and activity are so 
much called into exercise. 

Amidst all their disadvantages they are contented, and upon the 
whole comparatively comfortable, — there being nothing in their 
circumstances to prevent their possessing that happiness which is 
the fruit of, and can exist only in connection with, the influence of 
the blessings of the gospel. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The climate of the north-west coast of Scotland 
generally unfits it for the purposes of agriculture. In Glenelg such 
quantities of rain fall, and at all seasons, that an agriculturist might 
calculate on losing almost every fourth crop. This, and the small 
comparative amount of arable land, plainly point it out as adapted 
for pasture, — the farmer having in this line only the prospect of 
success, — sheep pasture, too, principally ; as the arable land could 
not afford sufficient supply of winter provender for any other de- 
scription of stock. Yet few districts of this coast, if any, equal 
Glenelg as to the quantity of arable land and the richness of soil. 
We cannot be wrong in estimating the number of acres in the whole 
parish that are occasionally in tillage, or might be, at about 1000. 
There are probably about 2000 acres under wood. The wealth 
of the country, however, consists in the luxuriance of its pasture. 
This remark applies to Knodyart and Morar, in common with 
Genelg Proper, but especially to the last. Good rents are con- 
sequently paid ; the average rent of grazing for a cow or ox being 
L. 2 Sterling for the season, and of pasture for a ewe or full-grown 
sheep, 3s. The black-cattle are generally of the pure Highland 
breed, kept free of all southern taint with extreme care. The old 
black-faced sheep stocks are rapidly disappearing before the white- 
faced or Cheviot, which are found uniformly more hardy, and, from 
the superior quality of their wool, vastly more profitable than the 
other description. Much attention is paid to the improvement of 
sheep stock, which soon finds its reward in the increased prices ob- 
tained for the various sorts disposed of, as well as for the wool. 
From the character of the climate, smearing with tar and butter is 
universally practised, so that tohite wool is not at all known among 
us. Every advantage, as might be naturally expected, is afforded 
the sheep-farmer as to the duration of his lease, which is seldom, 
if ever, under nineteen years. The requisite fences and buildings 



GLENELG. 



139 



for the management of this description of stock are in every case 
fully granted ; indeed, every facility is afforded both for rearing and 
improving.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication Src. — The nearest market-town is In- 
verness, which is at the same time the county town, and situated 
at the distance of about seventy miles. The means of communi- 
cation are good, inasmuch as the Parhamentary road into the Isle 
of Skye passes through the principal glen to the ferry of Kyle Rhea. 
This road, leading from Glensheal into Glenelg, over the stupend- 
ous pass of Mam Rataan, is excellent, — the bridges across the va- 
rious mountain streams being of the best construction, and always 
preserved in good repair. 

The Kirkton of Glenelg can boast of being a village of some 
extent, having the principal street of slated houses, and displaying 
the attractions of some well-stocked shops. The bay upon which 
the village is built alFords good anchorage with south-east, east, and 
north-east wind ; but the safest harbour with all winds is upon the 
opposite coast of Skye, and at the distance of one or two miles. 
The whole appearance of Kirkton is truly picturesque, including, 
as it does, the church, factor's residence, and street already allud- 
ed to, with its numerous train of straw-covered cottages, intersper- 
sed with various kinds of ornamental trees, surmounted by a thriv- 
ing planting of fir that towers majestically over it, and having lines 
of trees along the various roads that lead from it. All this, combin- 
ed with the beauty of the extensive bay and back-ground, has pro- 
cured for Kirkton, from the lovers of fine scenery, much admira- 
tion. Under the head of villages may also be mentioned Arnis- 
dale, possessing a population of 600, and situated at the south- 
ern extremity of the district of Glenelg Proper, on the banks of 
LochHourn. The Alpine scenery of this locality owes nothing to art. 
Its native grandeur, however, more' than compensates this neglect. 

In this extensive parish there is no post-office. Lochalsh, in the

miles from Glenelg, is the post-town. Thither we send, in the 
meantime, at our own expense, by the ferry of Loch Duich ; but 
it is expected that representations which have lately been made 
in the proper quarter, may lead to speedy improvement in this de- 
partment. 

Ecclesiastical State. — It has been already noticed that the church 
is situated close by Kirkton, consequently in the northern extremi- 
ty of the parish ; in fact, it is within two miles of the boundary of 
the neighbouring parish of Glensheal. The population of the 
Glenelg district comprises nearly two-thirds of the whole parish, 
and is, with the exception of a few families, exclusively Protes- 
tant. It is divided between the northern and southern extremities, 
in the proportions of 1100 souls to the former, and 700 to the 
latter. Arnisdale, the capital of the latter, is distant from the 
church and school-house at least thirteen miles, consequently can 
derive very little benefit from either. The distribution of the po- 
pulation, and not any error in placing the church, thus renders it 
the place of religious assembly merely of one section of the pa- 
rish. Situated as it is, it accommodates the largest division ; built 
any where else, it either would accommodate a smaller proportion, 
or none at all. The former would be the case had it been erected 
at Arnisdale ; the latter had it been placed at an intermediate 
point, with the view of serving both extremities of the district, as, 
from the distance and difficulty of access on each hand, seldom 
could any, and never the weak and infirm, come up to the house 
of God. The accommodation afforded by the church has ac- 
cordingly never exceeded what is required for the northern section 
of the Glenelg district, with its population of 1100, as it never 
contained more than from 300 to 400 sittings. About six years 
ao-o, it underwent a thorough repair, and now affords, so far as it 
goes, very comfortable accommodation. The attendance on pub- 
lic worship is always good ; and the average number of communi- 
cants for the whole parish is about 200. 

The two districts of Knodyart and Morar, bounded and sepa- 
rated as already described, have a population, with few exceptions, 
entirely Catholic. To this portion of the parish the Committee 
of the General Assembly for the management of the Royal Bounty 
has, for a number of years, assigned a missionary,— the order of his 
services being, that he preach two successive Sabbaths at two dif- 
ferent points in Knodyart, and the third at Arnisdale. From this

arrangement, in connection with the distance of the parish church, 
Arnisdale, with its large Protestant population, is truly inadequately 
supplied with the means of grace. Its circumstances, and also those 
of Knodyart, have been brought under the notice of the Religious 
Instruction Commission and of the General Assembly's Church 
Extension Committee; and it may be safely averred, that no station 
in Scotland can prefer a stronger claim, or come more clearly under 
the description of destitution, to the removal of which the Go- 
vernment and our church have, we trust, now resolved to apply 
their energies. 

In the Knodyart and Morar districts two Catholic priests of- 
ficiate, supported exclusively by the fees raised for their services. 
In the former there is a chapel, if the half dilapidated and straw- 
covered hut, which serves as a place of worship, may be dignified 
with that name ; in the latter another is in course of erection. 
The attendance at the first, from the dimensions of the house, 
can never exceed 100. For Knodyart the Honourable the Society 
for Propagating Christian Knowledge, three years ago,- granted 
an annual sum of L. 8 in support of a catechist; but as grants in 
such circumstances, by this Society, are made on the condition 
of an equivalent being provided by those benefited, that an ade- 
quate provision may be secured, this bounty has not hitherto been 
made available. 

The present manse of Glenelg was built four years ago. It is 
situated at a distance of more than a mile from the church, and 
a little way beyond the entrance of the larger glen. Of consider- 
able extent, and handsome structure, from the commanding si- 
tuation in which it stands, and in full view of the sea, it forms a 
striking object in connection with the surrounding exquisite scenery. 
The glebe, if it may be called by this name, is of great extent ; 
being above 360 acres, 50 of which nearly are good arable, the 
remainder being pasture ; and all this, exclusive of a shealing, at 
the distance of a few miles, calculated to be large enough for the 
pasture of a hundred sheep. The farm of Buarblach, of which 
this forms the description, constitutes the glebe, under the burden 
of an annual rent paid to the proprietor, of L. 19, Os. 7d. Sterling; 
and became so under the following circumstances : Subsequently 
to the Rebellion of 1715, Government resolved to erect in this part 
of the county a fort or barracks, the remains of v. hich are still extant, 
and the proprietor of Glenelg, the M'Leod of the day, being in 
London at the time, sold for the purpose the portion of land on 
which the building stands, and grounds to a considerable extent

around. In these, however, were inckided the original glebe; in lieu 
of which, in a subsequent arrangement with the presbytery, the farm 
of Buarblach, burdened as above, was given by regular deed, in- 
serted in the records, to the incumbent of the parish in all time to 
come. At the period of the transaction, it was no more than a 
fair equivalent, but the increase in the value of land since makes 
the glebe an important addition to the income of the minister. The 
teinds of the parish are exhausted, and the heritors, having resign- 
ed them on the occasion of the last augmentation, the stipend is 
fixed at the annual sum of L. 237, 7s. 9d. Sterling. 

Education. — We have at present five schools : one parochial, 
and four from the Edinburgh Gaelic School Society. The paro- 
chial school is situated at a short distance from the manse ; has a 
salary of L. 30 Sterling, with the legal accommodation, and a 
large" attendance of scholars, too poor to pay almost anything. 
The branches taught are, English and Gaehc reading, writing, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, and sometimes Latin. Though the full 
legal accommodations are provided for the schoolmaster, not L. 5 
a year are drawn in the shape of school fees. The principle ap- 
plied in selecting the situation for the church has also been ap- 
plied in the case of the school-house. Not only is it in the north- 
ern portion of the Glenelg district, so as to be useless to Arnis- 
dale, Knodyart, and Morar, but, in addition to this, there being 
no central point between the two glens, which form this northern 
portion, convenient for the children of both, it has been placed 
within the reach of the chief population, viz. near the opening of 
the larger glen, where it can easily be attended by 200 scho- 
lars. Its distance from Glenbeg is thus three miles, from Arnis- 
dale fourteen, from Knodyart eighteen and a broad ferry, and 
from Morar twenty, and two such ferries. In short, it is conve- 
nient only to about a fourth of the whole population. The immense 
deficiency in the means of education has hitherto been met solely 
by the Gaelic School Society,— a society which it is impossible to 
mention without rendering it the tribute of our gratitude for the 
unspeakable benefit it has conferred on so large a portion of the 
Highlands. Glenelg owes it much. But the schools established 
by this society being circulating, and their object limited to teach- 
ino- to read the scriptures in Gaehc, however valuable, considering 
the character of the people for whom they are intended, they can- 
not be held to be a sufficient substitute for parochial schools. 
Three additional parochial schools at least, we require, one for 
Arnisdale, one for Knodyart, one for Morar; and besides these.

there are several situations within our wide bounds which would 
still plead for such valuable aid as we now derive from the patriotic 
and Christian society to which allusion has been made. 

The prevalence of Catholicism in the southern districts of the 
parish declares the necessity of some measure for the supply of 
the means of instruction ; the want of which has, doubtless, prin- 
cipally maintained the ascendency of that form of religion there 
and elsewhere. _ Though the gospel be preached within the reach 
of Catholics they will not hear; it is a virtue, in their esteem, so 
to act ; and if at any time they be enticed to give their bodily pre- 
sence, they come so panoplied in ignorance and prejudice, that of 
them it maybe literally said, « they are like the deaf adder thatstop- 
peth her ear, and will not hearken to the voice of charmers charm- 
ing never so wisely." If, however, this ignorance and prejudice 
were removed, might we not expect another character If the M'ay 
were thus prepared through the means of instruction, might we 
not expect that the gospel would have free course and be grorified 
among them, hopeless though their case at present seems  

The number of the young betwixt six and fifteen years of age 
who can neither read nor write may be reckoned, for the whole 
parish, at 100 ; the number of persons upwards of fifteen years 
in similar circumstances, at 900. ' 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of poor on the roll 
IS about 40,— being thus small, frem the circumstance that the Ca- 
tholics never have applied for any portion of the funds. The bene 
fit to the other poor frem this cause is more than counterbalanced 
by the fact, that no preclamation of banns in the case of Catholic 
marriages ever takes place at the parish chureh, and consequent- 
ly no payment of the ordinary dues to us. 

'u' ""'y,"" possessed by the parish are the collections at 
the church doors, the fees for the proclamation of banns, exclusive 
of what fall to the share of the session-clerk and beadle ; and the 
mulcts or fines that are imposed by the kirk-session for various de 
linquencies which come within their jurisdiction. The whole never 
amounts to more than L. 20 Sterling per annum, subject to pay- 
ment ol a small salary to the precentor, stationery for the clerk 
aiid part of the expense incurred on the interment of paupers' 
The average sum allotted to each person receiving aid is conse- 
quently small, not exceeding 8s. annually ; which is thankfully re- 
ceived, and never asked nor allotted, save in cases absolutely 
requirmg it. Of the district of Glenelg Proper, it has long been 
a distinction that few travel frem it as beggars into olher quar

ters, and thcat those who require aid come not to their neighbours 
who are able to give, as common beggars, to receive from day to 
day, or from week to week, a miserable pittance ; but on some few 
occasions, in course of the year, when they know it will be both 
convenient and agreeable to bestow the required boon. It follows 
that the poor among us are comparatively well provided for, upon 
the whole, without the aid of any public assessment, and purely 
from the inexhaustible and grateful source of private benevolence. 
The truly parental leniency of the proprietor produces in a great 
degree this happy result. 

Ji'airs. — In this parish are held three fairs ; to correspond with 
the great fairs in the south ; in the months of May, July, and Sep- 
tember respectively.

Puel. The only fuel is peat or turf, excepting that a few of the 

more wealthy sheep-farmers burn a proportion of coals imported,

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking variation betwixt the present state of the pa- 
rish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, consists in its being opened up by the road which runs 
through it ; and by the hebdomadal visits of a steam-boat, regu- 
larly paid, save during the stormy months of winter. By these 
means we have learned that there is a world beyond Glenelg. The 
Chinese-like self-preference which once existed, accompanied by a 
contempt of those, who, less fortunate than we, had been ordained 
to draw breath first in some other district, is passing away, and giving 
place to a more enlightened, a more rational, and Christian feeling. 
Since the period alluded to, also, the large farm system has come 
more fully into operation, and its evils have been developed. By 
it the country has been bereaved of her worthiest children, and, 
in the exaltation of a few individuals, thousands are doomed to po- 
vertv. The ease to the land-owner in securing the returns of his 
property can be no compensation for this evil ; and, difficult though 
the re- establishment of another order of things may now be, the gra- 
dual breaking up of the present system, and engaging the energies 
of the population who now live without an object, in that hne of 
industry to which they have been accustomed, which they under- 
stand and love, seems to be the improvement that religion, patri- 
otism, and sound policy demand in behalf of so large, so valuable 
and important a portion of the community.

PRESBYTERY OF SKYE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. DONALD MACLEAN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name of the parish. — This parish derives its name from the 
islands of which it consists. The chief of these are four in number. 
They form a part of the western Hebrides, and are surrounded by 
the Atlantic. Their names are Eigg, Muck, Rum and Canna. 
To three of them, three lesser islands are respectively attached, 
or nearly so : — To Eigg, Ellain Chaistal, or Castle Island ; to 
Muck, Ellain no 'n Each, or Horse Island ; and to Canna, Ellain 
Gainmhich or Sandy Island. These lesser islands, with the excep- 
tion of the last mentioned, are uninhabited. 

— The island of Eigg is supposed to derive. its name from 
the Gaelic word Ec, signifying a niche, nick, or hollow. This ap- 
pellation is descriptive of the appearance of the island, which is 
intersected in the middle by a glen, running across from sea to 
sea. On each side of this glen, the land rises to a considerable 
elevation, terminating towards the south-west in Scur Eigg, or the 
lofty rock of Eigg, and towards the north-east in Bein vui, or the 
yellow mountain. Viewing it from, a distance, it appears as if it 
were two islands separated by an arni of the sea. 

Extent ofEigg.—YAgg is about 5 or 6 miles in length, and about 
3 in breadth, containing about 5580 acres, exclusive of the glebe. 

Topographical Appearances of Eigg.— The land upon the south 
side of this island rises gradually from the shore to a considerable 
elevation. The lower ground is alternately covered with fine grass 
and heath ; and arable and fertile spots are intermingled with those 
of a less fertile description. The soil being thin and gravelly, is well 
adapted for the culture of potatoes and turnips ; but, more especi- 
ally, the land is fitted for the rearing both of black-cattle and sheep. 
There are about 3649 acres of moor land in the middle of the island, 
which are covered with heather and coarse grass, interspersed in 
some places with a few small fresh water lakes, in which no fish is

to be found. On the nortli-west side, is a fine sandy bay, above 
which there is a considerable extent of low rich ground, very fer- 
tile, and yielding excellent crops of potatoes, bear, and oats. Here, 
there is a great quantity of limestone, which might easily be worked, 
and made available for agricultural and other useful purposes. No 
attempt of this kind, however, has been as yet made. It is entirely 

formed of shells. 

ScurEigg. — Scur Eigg is an immense rock, placed on the summit 
of the highest land in the island. The front of it looks towards the 
east, and from the sea assumes a bold and picturesque appearance. 
From the base it is about 400 feet in perpendicular height. In 
a clear serene day, the prospect from the top of this rock is beau- 
tiful and extensive. From this, you see the ocean studded with 
islands ; ships of all sizes passing and repassing on their various 
courses ; hills and dales, mountains and glens, — with one continu- 
ed outline of coast ; all of which to the eye of the beholder must 
be indeed very interesting. Numerous caves are around the coast ; 
some of them wide and spacious, and some low and narrow. Among 
these, is one called in Gaehc naimli Fhraing, signifying the cave 
of Frances, — so narrow at the mouth, that a person must creep on 
hands and knees to obtain an entrance. Within, it is lofty and ex- 
tensive. In this cave, a great many human bones are still to be 
seen, said to be the bones of the inhabitants of the island, who were 
Macdonalds, and who had taken refuge in it as a place of safety, 
where they were discovered and suffocated by the Macleods, then at 
enmity with them. Professor Jameson gives the following account 
of this cave : — 

« The minister of this parish, who was so good as to accompany 
us to several parts of the island, led us by a very rugged path to 
a wild sequestered spot where there is a cave, remarkable, in the 
annals of this isle, for the murder of the Macdonalds, inhabitants 
of Eigg, by the Macleods of Skye. As this story is truly charac- 
teristic of the state of society in those parts at that period, 1 think 
it will not be uninteresting to relate it shortly. 

" A party of the Macleods having landed upon the small island 
of Eillan Chastel, behaved so outrageously to the women who 
were there tending cattle, that their friends instantly pursued and 
put several of them to death. This so enraged the clan of Mac- 
leod, that they determined to take revenge, by ravaging the isle 
and putting to death the murderers of their brothers. The island- 
ers sensible of their weakness, prepared to shelter themselves upon

the first appearance of an enemy. Soon afterwards a number of 
boats were seen approaching the isle ; when the trembhng inhabi- 
tants retired in despair to this cave, their only refuge. The Mac- 
leods soon landed and traversed the whole island ; but as they 
could discover no human being, they concluded that the Mac- 
donalds had made their escape to the mainland, or to some of the 
adjacent islands. Disappointed and enraged, they were about to 
leave Eigg to return to Skye, when unfortunately one of the horde 
observed the mark of footsteps on the snow ; and thus they were 
enabled to discover the cave where the wretched inhabitants had 
taken refuge. Shrieks of despair were interrupted for a little by 
a proposal of the Macleods, that, if the murderers were given up 
to punishment, the other lives should be spared. This was only a 
cruel aggravation of their sufferings, as the Macleods were the ag- 
gressors. Connected, as the Macdonalds were, by the dearest 
ties, they were determined to perish together rather than to give 
up one of their number. The Macleods, with the most savage 
barbarity, instantly kindled great fires at the mouth of the cave, 
which soon suffocated the whole of the miserable inhabitants. 

" One often listens even to such a tale, as to the description of 
a battle, without much interest; but the view of the scene never 
fails to awaken a keener sympathy,— the circumstances are brought 
nearer to the mind, and seem to be passing before us. We stood 
on the very ground where this tragedy was acted, and felt our sen- 
sibility increased by the sequestered and dreary place in which the 
deed was done. But even this interest was faint when compared 
to that we felt when, after creeping a considerable way through a 
low and narrow entrance, half-covered with brushwood, we found 
ourselves at last within a large and gloomy cave, the extent and 
height of which we could not distinguish, and perceived the gleams 
ol the lights we carried reflected from the bones and skulls of the 
unhappy Macdonalds. The force with which the truth and all 
the circumstances of this dreadful tale struck at this moment upon 
our minds, and the strange variety of sensations excited by an 
event so extraordinary, it is not easy to find words to express. 

Ihe entrance of the cave is low and narrow for about 12 
feet, the breadth 14 feet, and in length it extends inwards nearly

on the black sides of the caves, without dispelling that deep and

skulls and scattered bones catcbed a strong light Our figures, 
too, touched with the paley flame, showed the features, or an out- 
stretched arm, while the parts of the body removed from the light 
were lost in the gloom. Even the deep and sonorous voice of the 
parson had its effect. The whole scene was admirably adapted 
for the canvass; but it would require a very rare talent m the painter 
who should attempt it." • . . 

There is no safe harbour in this island for large shipping ; but a 
quay sufficiently secure for their own purposes has been budt by the 

inhabitants. . . . . . , 

Name of Muck.— The Island of Muck derives its name, it is said, 
from the monks of Iona,-having been first called Monk Island, 
which afterwards by corruption was changed into Muck. It was in 
former times church lands, attached to that celebrated monastery. 

Extent and Topographical Appearances of Much.— Muck is reck- 
oned 2 miles long, and 1 broad. It is a low fertile island, well 
adapted for the rearing of black cattle, and for the cultivation of 
green and corn crops. With the exception of a little hill in the 
north end, whose summit is covered with heath, it is all green. 
The grass is of the finest description. Upon the whole, it is a 
beautiful little island. There is no safe harbour in it, but small 
boats are secured by means of a quay, built by the inhabitants. 
Here there is no peat for fuel, so that the people are under the 
necessity of importing this necessary article of household economy 
from the mainland of Ardnamurchan. 

Name of Rum. -The Island of Rum derives its name froni its 
magnitude and extent, in comparison with the other islands ; Rum 
siffnifving in Gaelic roominess or capacity.  . , . 

Extent and Topographical Appearances ofRum.-li of a circu™ 
lar form, and about 18 or 20 miles in circumference. The island is 
lofty and mountainous; and although a few of the hills are green, yet 
the most of them exhibit a rough, abrupt, and craggy appear- 
ance From the rocky materials of which they consist, they are, 
especially in winter during snow, dangerous and unsafe for shep- 
herds, who frequent them in quest of sheep, so that upon moi-e 
than one occasion, some of them have been lost. Upon the east- 
outh-east and north-east sides, the ground is covered for the mos 
'rt with heath, strong heather, and coarse grass The soil is s 
nnd wet composed of peat earth over a substratum of rock. On 
I lelund north-wes sides, it is almost all covered with a green

sward ; the grass is fine, and exhibits a striking contrast to the 
other parts of the island. Some of the hills are here green to the 
very summits. The soil, the grass, the land and rocks, bear a 
striking resemblance to those of the opposite coast of Sandy Island, 
and seem to indicate that, at some former period, they had been 
separated by some powerful operation of nature. About the 
middle of the island, among the mountains, are several fresh water 
lakes of considerable dimensions. Small trout are abundant in 
some of them. Around this island, the coast is bold and wild ; 
more especially, the south and west sides are nearly altogether sur- 
rounded with one continued rampart of rock. Upon the east side, 
there is a good, safe, and commodious harbour, for all manner of 
shipping ; and lately an excellent quay has been made there by 
the present tacksman of the island. 

Name, Extent, c. of Canna. — The etymology of Canna is to me 
unknown. The island is about 5 or 6 miles in length, and 2 or 
3 in breadth, containing, exclusive of Sandy Island, 2253 acres, 
of which 459 are arable, and 1794 are pasture. This island, 
together with Sandy Island adjoining, are both very fertile, 
yielding great crops of potatoes, and barley or bear. From 100 
to 200 quarters of barley or bear are annually disposed of, and 
about 3200 bushels of potatoes, — being all the produce of the 
island, over and above the quantity which the inhabitants re- 
quire for their own maintenance. The island is all clothed with 
verdure. The grass is fine and short, and well adapted for the 
rearing of black-cattle, of which a good many are annually sent 
to the markets in the south and sold. Here is an excellent har- 
bour; well sheltered, safe and commodious. In former times, 
it was much frequented, particularly by the Baltic traders, and 
is still frequented by shipping of every description. In its vici- 
nity is an eminence called Compass hill, which is said to disar- 
range the compass so much, as to cause it to whirl round, so that, 
when placed near it, no faith can be placed in its magnetic virtue. 

Geology. — The geology of this parish was first examined by 
Professor Jameson ; afterwards Dr MacCulloch, in his usual style, 
published an account of this interesting groupe of islands, but with- 
out acknowledging the source from which he derived the principal 
details of its mineralogy. More lately, several continental natu- 
ralists have visited and published observations on these islands; 
and their natural history has at various times engaged the atten-

tion of British observers. The following notice of the geology of 
these islands is all we can spare room for : 

1. JEiffff. — Is composed of those newer secondary strata of sand- 
stone, limestone, and slate-clay, named lias, and of various trap 
and pitchstone rocks. The sandstone, which is generally white, is 
composed of grains of quartz held together by a basis of marl. 
Often it exhibits the globular structure first observed in sandstone 
rocks by Professor Jameson. The limestone is grey, with a com- 
pact fracture, and contains various organic remains, such as am- 
monites, belemnites, gryphytes, &amp;c. The slate clay, which has the 
usual characters of that substance, contains various organic remains. 
Fossil plants, still retaining their woody structure, occur in it. 

The trap rocks, which form so considerable a portion of this 
island, are of the species known under the names greenstone, amyg- 
daloid, wacke, and tufFa. These rocks contain in cavities and 
small veins various beautiful minerals, such as stilbite, mesotype, 
analcime, calcareous spar, quartz crystals, and calcedony. The 
pitchstone rocks are pitchstone, properly so called, and pitchstone 
porphyry. The pitchstone, which is of various colours, as black, 
green, blue, sometimes contains mineral oil. This oil, which is 
the colouring matter of some of the varieties of the pitchstone, oc- 
curs also in cavities of the rock. The pitchstone prophyry contains 
in a base of pitchstone crystals of glassy felspar. The rock of the 
Scuir exhibits one of the most splendid displays of the columnar ar- 
rangement hitherto discovered in this or in any other country. Pro- 
fessor Jameson, who first made known this splendid scene in his 
" Mineralogy of the Western Islands," has the following remarks : 
" We now ascended from this point to the Scuir Eigg, which we 
have before observed to be the highest part of the island. This 
hill, from its peculiar shape, has at a distance a singular appear- 
ance ; but as we approach nearer, it rises much in grandeur, and 
at length a stupendous columnar promontory bursts on our view. 
The whole of this promontory is perfectly mural, and extends for 
upwards of a mile and a-half, and rises to a height of several hun- 
dred feet. It is entirely columnar, and the columns rise in suc- 
cessive ranges until they reach the summit, where, from their great 
height, they appear, when viewed from below, diminutive. Staffa 
is an object of the greatest beauty and regularity ; the pillars are 
as distinct as if they had been reared by the hand of art ; but 
it has not the extent or sublimity of the Scuir Eigg. The one may 
be compared with the greatest exertions of human power ; the

other is characteristic of the wildest and most inimitable works of 
nature." The Scuir Eigg Dr MacCulloch maintains to be the old- 
est-of the igneous rocks in the island, although even the merest 
tyro in geology could show that it is the newest. 

2. Rum. — This rugged island is composed of an old red sand- 
stone, which is traversed and overlaid by various plutonian or ig- 
nigenous rocks. The red sandstone, which is distinctly stratified, 
dipping generally to the sou-th-west, alternates with beds of a red- 
coloured slate clay. The plutonian rocks are the following : au- 
gite-greenstone, in some parts forming an augite rock, amygda- 
loid, basaltic greenstone, and porphyry sometimes assuming the 
syenitic character. In cliffs of amygdaloid opposite the island of 
Canna, there occur beautiful varieties of heliotrope or blood-stone, 
of calcedony, and other minerals usually met with in cavities and 
veins in amygdaloidal rocks. 

3. Canna. — Is composed chiefly of ignigenous rocks of the trap 
series,— very small portions only of the lias, a secondary rock, occur- 
nng in the island. The ignigenous rocks are common augite- 
greenstone, basaltic greenstone, amygdaloid, and trap tuffa. The 
trap tuffa, which occurs very abundantly in the island, is made up 
of rounded fragments of trap, sandstone, granite, &amp;c. cemented by 
a trap base. In some places. Professor Jameson observed pieces 
of wood, resembling the surturbrand of Iceland, imbedded in it ; also 
thin seams of brown coal. Cavities in the amygdaloid are lined 
with zeolites of different species, much prized by collectors of mi- 
nerals, also crystals of calcareous spar. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners.— Tv Hugh Macpherson, Professor of Greek in 
King's College, Aberdeen, is proprietor of the Island of Eigg. It 
became his property by purchase at Whitsunday 1828. Before 
that period, it, with the Island of Canna, formed a part of the large 
and extensive possessions of the ancient family of Clanranald. The 
Islands of Rum and Muck belong to Maclean of Coll, and the Is- 
land of Canna to Macneil, who likewise got possession of it bv pur- 
chase in 1828. 

Parochial /eriers.— Parochial registers have never been reo u- 
larly kept in this parish.  

HzzVs._Two fortifications seem to have been in the Islands 
of Muckand Canna one in each, though now so much defaced by 
time, that scarce any vestige of them can be traced. Each of them 
had the name of Dun, signifying a castle or fort,— the one in Muck 



152 INVERNESS-SHIRK. 

being named Dun Ban or White Castle ; and that in Canna, Curra 
Dhun or unsteady fort, from the small extent of its foundation, it being 
placed on a high and very narrow rock. From this castle, one of the 
farms in the island still takes its name. About the centre of the 
Island of Rum, long dikes may still be traced, which, beginning at 
considerable distances from each other, gradually approach, until 
at last they draw pretty near to one another. These are said 
to have been intended as toils for deer, which were once, as is well 
known, numerous in that island. To these enclosures the inhabit- 
ants collected them, and, forcing them by degrees to their narrow- 
est recesses, they were finally caught by their pursuers. The 
places where these enclosures were made still maintain the names 
of Tiffh'n Sealff, that is, the hunting-houses; so that it is likely that 
at the termination of the dikes, houses were erected, into which 
the deer were constrained to enter, and in this manner a number 
of them would be at once secured. 

Mansion- Houses. — With the exception of Mr Macneil's house 
in Canna, there are no other mansion-houses. He is the only 
heritor that resides within the bounds of the parish. His house 
was originally intended for a farm -house, but lately he improved it 
considerably,— insomuch, that it is now a large, commodious, and 
comfortable habitation. Behind the dwelling-house is his garden, 
which is well stocked both with ornamental and fruit trees, and is 
otherwise exceedingly productive— in greens and roots. In this 
garden are the only trees which are to be seen upon the island. 

In the Island of Rum, a good dwelling house, with splendid of- 
fices, was erected by Dr Maclean, the present tacksman, in 1826, 
who spared neither pains nor expense in draining, fencing, and 
planting around his residence, at the end of the harbour in that is- 
land. °His improvements have been carried on, on a very exten- 
sive scale. They exhibit both taste and judgment, and to reward 
his diligence, his plantation of trees is now in a forward and thriv- 
ing state. The other islands may be said to be as nature left 
them, saving that in Eigg tolerable farm-houses are to be found. 

III. — Population. 
In 1831, the population of the parish was found to be 1015 
souls. Some years previous it was much greater. In 1826, all 
the inhabitants of the Island of Rum, amounting at least to 400 
souls, found it necessary to leave their native country, and to seek 
for new abodes in the distant wilds of our colonies in America. 
Of all the old residenters, only one family remained upon the 



I 



SMALL ISLES, 



153 



island. The old and the young, the feeble and the strong, were all 
united in this general emigration, — the former to find tombs in a 
foreign land, — the latter to encounter toils, privations, and dan- 
gers, to become familiar with customs, and to acquire habits, — to 
which they had formerly been entire strangers. A similar emigra- 
tion took place in 1828, from the Island of Muck, so that the pa- 
rish has now been much depopulated. The population of Rum 
was thus reduced from 400 to 100 or 130. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture, with the rearing of black-cattle and sheep, is the 
prevailing occupation in these islands. The sea-weed, both that 
which is cut, and that which is cast ashore by the winter storms, 
is the chief manure. With the aid of this, the people generally 
raise as many potatoes, on which they for the most part subsist, 
as are requisite for their maintenance during the whole of the 
year,— each family requiring from 240 to 320 bushels. From 300 
to 400 heads of black-cattle are annually sold in the parish to deal- 
ers at home, who again bring them to the south country markets 
for sale. The number of sheep pastured in the Island of Rum 
alone is about 8000, which are all of the black-faced kind, and 
which are likewise all salved or smeared. Among the inhabitants 
are some artisans, such as weavers, boat-builders, smiths, tailors, 
and one shoemaker : but although these devote some of their time 
to the various employments of their calling, yet they chiefly de- 
pend upon their agricultural occupations for their subsistence. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
There are no villages ; and no inns, excepting one in the Island 
of Eigg. In each of the islands, there was formerly an inn. There 
IS no packet, nor any regular means of communication with the 
post-office or mainland from any one of the islands. For this and 
other reasons, every person is under the necessity of keeping a boat 
always in readiness for his own comfort and convenience. The 
distance between the Island of Eigg and the nearest post-office at 
Arisaig IS thirteen or fourteen miles. The other islands are at 
much more considerable distances. A road has been carried 
across the Island of Eigg, by the statute labour of the inhabitants. 

Ecclesiastical State.— There is no church on any of the islands. 
In Eigg we assemble in the school-house for public worship ; but 
in the other islands we sometimes meet in the fields, when we can- 
not conveniently get a house to receive us. The manse was 
erected m the Island of Eigg in 1790. It has been often repair-

ed, but it is so much exposed to the winter gales, and so high above 
the level of the sea, that it is hardly possible to make it comfort- 
able, or to keep it so for any length of time. The glebe is a 
grass glebe, and may maintain sixteen soums of black-cattle. The 
stipend is one of the small livings, and Government pays L.64, 16s 
annually. 

Education. — There is but one parochial school in the parish. 
It is in the Island of Eig The house was built in 1829, and 
made very comfortable. The salary was, the same year, in- 
creased from L. 18 to L. 30. The school fees may amount to 
L. ] 0 a year. The present schoolmaster is not noted for atten- 
tion to his scholars, or diligence in the discharge of his duty. He 
seldom has more than from 20 to 30 scholars, and often he has 
none, the parents withholding them from the school, as knowing 
that they make no progress in their education under him. Ex- 
cepting in the Island of Muck, where the Gaelic School Society 
has had a teacher for the last three years, there is no other school 
in any of the islands. Principal Baird has, however, promised to 
send one, if the requisite accommodations can be obtained from 
the heritor. There are about 600 persons above six years of age 
in this parish who can neither write nor read. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor upon the roll 
in this parish is 10, They live in their own houses, or with their 
nearest relations. The only fund from which they derive any be- 
nefit is one of L. 30, bequeathed by the late Captain Macaskill 
of Morinish, in the Island of Mull. Any addition to the interest 
of this sum is made up by fines. We have no beggars.

PRESBYTERY OF UIST, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. JOHN MACIVOR, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. . 

Name.—Tihi. of late, this parish was designed Kilbride. It is 
now denominated in English, Harris; and evidently derives its 
name from « 7ia hardibh,"—a Gaelic expression signifying the 
heights,— this parish being the highest and most mountainous part 
of the long island in which it is situated. 

Extent and Boundaries.— Its extent from norlh to south is 50 
miles, and its breadth varies from 8 to 24 miles. Its superficial 
extent is upwards of 146 square miles. It is bounded on the north, 
by the parishes of Lochs and Uig in Lewis ; on the west, by the 
Atlantic Ocean ; on the east, by the channel ; and oh the south 
by the parish of North Uist, from which it is separated by a nar- 
row sound, running betwixt the Island of Bernera and Uist, called 
Caolas Uist, i. e. the Sound of Uist. A chain of mountains 
run along from the sound of Harris to the boundaries of Lewis, 
the highest average from 2000 to 3000 feet above the level of the 
sea. The shore along the west coast is, in some parts, sandy in 
other parts rocky and precipitous. The east coast is indented 
with harbours, bays, and creeks. 

Islands.-k multitude of islands lie irregularly interspersed 
through the sound of Harris. Four of these are inhabited, viz. 
Bernera, Pabba, Ensay, and Killigray; the rest are consigned to 
pasturage. The other islands of any extent in the parish are 
bcalpa, Tarrensay, and Scarp : these are all peopled. 

Meteorology, §-c.-The temperature of the atmosphere for eiffht 
months ,s cold and moist; during, the rest of the year, it is mHd. 
1 be wmds blow more frequently from the south and west than any 
other pomt. The greatest quantity of rain falls in the months of 
September, October, and November. The most prevalent com- 
plaint s rheumatism. The climate is considered very salubrious 

1 he fresh water lakes and rivulets that intersect the country 
are so numerous, that it is impossible to particularize them. The

waters of Lacksta, Scunt, and Obbe teem with salmon and trout, 
and afford delightful sport to the angler. 

Geology. — The predominating rock in this parish is gneiss, but 
subordinate to it are many other rocks of the primitive class. It 
is much to be regretted that hitherto no skilful geologist has fully 
examined the numerous mineralogical and geological relations of 
the rocks of Harris. 

Zoology. — Grouse, which were very plentiful on the moors, some 
years ago, have lately suffered from the depredations of the pole- 
cat and other vermin. Large herds of deer range among the hills 
and glens. Innumerable flocks of geese, plover, and pigeons fre- 
quent the low grounds and islands. The eagle visits the inacces- 
sible rocks. The natives occasionally capture with the harpoon 
the sun-fish, which loiters along the coast during the summer 
months, and slaughter with clubs a considerable number of seals 
in the island of Gaasker. Oysters are very abundant, and several 
boats are engaged in the fishing of lobsters, which are regularly 
forwarded by smacks to the London market. Particular attention 
has been paid to the rearing of black-cattle and sheep. Cheviots 
have been introduced into the country, and are found to answer 
uncommonly well. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owner.— The Earl of Dunmore is sole proprietor of the 

parish. 

Parochial Register.— \t is only within the last few years that a 
parochial register of marriages and births has been regularly kept. 

Antiqidties.-kt Rodil stand the ruins of the churchattached 
to the Priory of St Clements. It was once used as one of the pa- 
rochial places of worship in this parish, but has been deserted fmm 
its dilapidated state. Among the remains ascribed to Druidism 
are two stones raised on end, about eight feet above the ground, 
and surrounded by a circle of smaller stones. There is scarcely 
a vestige of the Danish fortresses extant, the materials having 
been applied to other buildings. 

III. — Population. 

In the year 1755, the population amounted to 1969 souls; in 
179-2, to 2536; and at the present period, it is upwards of 4000. 
By the last census, there were, males, 1863 ; females, 2037 ; fa- 
milies, 777 ; houses inhabited, 759. 

Language.— TXe Gaelic language is universally spoken. 

Character and Habits of the People.-The people are generally 
sober and industrious. Some of their articles of dress are of the

most primitive description, and of the coarsest materials, all ma- 
nufactured by themselves. Their food principally consists of po- 
tatoes, fish, and meal. They seldom can indulge themselves in 
the luxury of either beef or mutton. Crime is very rare among 
them. There is not a tradition of a murder, and theft is also un- 
frequent. A powerful religious revival took place among them 
five years ago, and in consequence the Sabbath is strictly observed. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The arable ground is of very small extent. The 
district is more adapted for pasture. Some of the most fertile 
farms, possessed by small tenants, have been depopulated, and con- 
verted into extensive sheep-walks. 

Bent. — When kelp was in great demand, the rental of this pro- 
perty amounted to L.TOOO a year ; it is now reduced to L.3500. 
The estate was purchased a few years ago by Lord Dunmore for 
L.60,000. 

Bate of Wages. — Farm-servants receive from L.3 to L.3, 10s. 
in the half-year, and female servants from L.l, 5s. to L.l, 10s. 
during the same period. Masons and carpenters from Is. 6d. to 
2s. per diem, exclusive of victuals. 

No leases have been hitherto given to small tenants on the 
estate, which must necessarily prevent the improvement of the 
soil. The cottages occupied by these humble men are of very 
small dimensions, composed of unhewn stone and earth for mor- 
tar, thatched with straw, in which they and their families, as well 
as their cows and horses, live for seven months in the year. The 
most respectable farm-steadings are built of stone and lime, but, 
from long unoccupancy, are now generally, if not wholly, falling 
rapidly into decay. 

Fisheries.— Yarious attempts were made by Alexander Mac- 
leod, Esq., the late worthy and benevolent proprietor, to establish 
fishing colonies in several parts of this parish ; but they all proved 
unsuccessful. 

Produce.— The average annual value of raw produce raised in 
the country may be estimated as follows : 

Oats and barley, about - L.2500 

Potatoes, - . 3000 

Hay, - - . 400

INVlillNIiSS-SHIRE. 



Manufactures. — There is no manufacture of any kind but tliat 
of kelp, in which all the population capable of manual labour is 
employed for two months in the year. 

Navigation. — There are only four small vessels belonging to 
owners on this property. They are employed in transferring kelp 
to market. The harbour of Scalpa is much resorted to by foreign 
shipping. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The year in which the parish church 
which is now in ruins was built cannot be accurately ascertained. 
It is about the centre of the parish, and formerly accommodated 
250 sitters. The present incumbent has applied for a new church. 
The manse was built in 1827, and the value of the glebe is about 
L.16. The stipend has been made up by Government to L.150. 
A Government church was erected at Bernera in 1829. The 
district assigned to the pastor comprehends all the islands in 
the Sound of Harris. A missionary is supported by the Royal 
Bounty at Tarbart. A church and manse were granted for his ac- 
commodation by the late proprietor, A. N. Macleod. All the pa- 
rishioners profess to belong to the Established Church. The an- 
nual church collections amount to L.2. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish are four, 
— one parochial, and three supported by the Gaelic School So-' 
ciety. The branches taught in the parish school are, Latin, arith- 
metic, writing, and English reading. The parochial schoolmaster 
has only L. 21 of salary, and fees are seldom exacted. The 
school-house is in such a wretched state of repair, that parents 
have been under the necessity of withdrawing their children. Very 
few above thirty years are able to read. The young people read 
the Scriptures in their native tongue. 

Poor. — The church collections are so trifling, that a distribution 
of the funds rarely takes place. They are expended in the inter- 
ment of paupers. It would be highly desirable that the proprie- 
tors should give an annual allowance for the support of the poor 
in the parish. 

Eairs.—ThQ annual cattle-tryst takes place in the month of 
July. 

/wws.— There are two licensed inns in the parish. They are 
seldom frequented by the natives. 

puel. Peat is the only fuel used by the inhabitants. 

 A nc-w church was erected last season capable of accommodating 400 sitters. 



NORTH UIST. 159 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The condition of the people might be ameliorated by enlarging 
their tenements of land, granting leases, and giving encouragement 
to schools. Churches and school-houses have been hitherto much 
neglected.

PRESBYTERY OF UIST, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. FINLAY M'RAE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The term Uist may be distinctly traced to the word 
Vist which the Danes and other northern nations are said to use, 
signifying the west. 

Extent, The length of North Uist is about 30 miles, 

and its breadth varies from 8 to 14 miles. The exact number 
of square miles it contains, it is not easy very accurately to ascer- 
tain, the greater part of it being, beyond description, indented by 
arms of the sea and fresh water lakes. 

North Uist lies nearly in the middle of the range of islands from 
the But, or northernmost point of the Lewis to Barra Head, the 
southernmost part. This range taken together is denominated the 
Long Island. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded on the north-east by the Sound of 
Harris, varying in breadth from 1 to 8 miles, and which separates 
it from the parish of the same name ; on the south-east, by the 
Minch, or a channel of about 16 miles breadth, which divides it 
from Skye ; on the south-west, it is divided from Benbecula, a part 
of the parish of South Uist, by sands of some extent, passable on 
foot at low-water, but covered by the sea at about half-tide ; and 
on the north-west, by the Atlantic Ocean. 

Topographical Appearances.— lis figure is almost triangular. 
Along the east coast, there is a range of hills, scarcely deserving ' 
the name of mountains, rising gradually from the north to the 
south, and varying in height from 300 to above 700 feet. These 
are intersected, not by ravines, valleys, and rivulets, but by inlets ,• 



160 



INVERNESS-SHIIIE. 



of the sea, forming safe and commodious harbours, and supplying 
shelter and safety to the weather-beaten ship and to the storm- 
weary sailor. 

Within this range, towards the west, is a large extent of soft, 
deep, barren moor, intersected in every direction by fresh water 
lakes of several miles in length. Farther on still, in the same di- 
rection, another less regular range of hills, of no great height, 
arises covered with heath and some coarse pasture ; and beyond, is 
a thin black moor, covering hard gravel, and occasionally inter- 
spersed with flats and meadows. Next to this, still to the west, 
is the part principally appropriated to pasture and culture, which 
exhibits a striking contrast to the barren, boggy, and useless scene 
behind. 

With the exception of a few bold rocky headlands, the west 
coast is all along bounded with light white sands, chiefly formed 
of shells, crumbled and pounded by the irresistible force of the 
Atlantic waves, gathering strength as they uninterruptedly roll their 
magnificent, awfully grand, ahd incalculable force upon the shores. 
The sand, or rather shells, thus literally ground to beautiful fineness, 
is, when dry, wafted by the winds into the interior of the country 
to a very considerable distance; and possessing the qualities of 
lime, it adds much to the productive qualities and the beauty 
of the belt over which it extends. This belt which, generally 
speaking, is the only cultivated part of the west side, is ex- 
ceedingly beautiful and pleasant in the summer and autumn 
months. If these seasons be accompanied with warmth and mois- 
ture, this part yields the richest pasture of white and red clover, 
and other plants and herbs delighting in dry sandy situations. It 
also yields luxuriant crops of barley or bear, and, under proper 
management, grain crops of every description. In dry seasons, 
however, by the heat of the sand, the grass becomes sickly, wither- 
ed, and of a burnt appearance ; the crops on the machirs, a term 
used for sandy soil, fail; and vegetation appears almost destroyed. 
Although, during a favourable summer season, the country exhibits 
a delightful prospect of beauty and luxuriance, the scene is totally 
changed during the winter and spring months. Without high 
hills, and destitute of trees to shelter from the tremendous gales 
which during these seasons prevail, bare and unprotected, the 
face of the country lies exposed to their influence. The finer, 
the softer, the more tender, and the more valuable grasses are 
melted away by the rain, the frost, and storms ; and the cattle, at 



NORTH UlST. 



161 



this time of the year, principally depend for their sustenance on 
the stores of the corn-yards ; and if this source prove not sufficient, 
the loss of many valuable cattle is the consequence, and a scarcity 
of provisions among the poorer of the inhabitants in summer. 
The cattle being out-liers, or not housed, in the circumstances I 
have stated, they must suffer. But the remark does not apply to 
the east side of the country, where there are excellent winterings 
for cattle. The west side of Uist is not, for the reason stated, so 
valuable for wintering as the less fine and more rough pasture of 
Skye and Harris. 

Caves. — Of caves or caverns — there are only two worth describ- 
ing. One of these is at the point of Tighary, situated at a short dis- 
tance from the parish church. It is hollowed, a considerable space 
in the rock, by the action of the waves, which beat with violence 
against the point where it is formed. The outer or external side of 
the cave is naturally yet regularly arched through the solid rock. 
Within this arch, from the superincumbent surface, is an opening of 
about twelve feet diameter. The immense volume of flood poured 
into the cave, too copious at once to recede, rises during and after a 
storm, as if from the bowels of the earth, in splendid magnificence, 
to the height of upwards of 200 feet. It is called Sloch-a-chorry, 
or cave of the kettle. Three miles from this, on the farm of Scol- 
peg, is the other cave, similarly formed, but more extensive and 
capacious, and in consequence not producing the like phenome- 
non ; but exhibiting awful grandeur to such as admire 

" Cliffs of darkness, caves of wonder, 
Echoing the Atlantic's thunder." 

Harbours.— It has been already observed that the greater part of 
the coast washed by the Atlantic is bordered with flat sands. This 
renders it inaccessible and unsafe for vessels of considerable size. 
There are some places, however, on the west coast, where vessels- 
belongmg to the country and others take shelter, and ship kelp in 
the summer season. These places are Digmore, on the farm of Bal- 
ranald, not far from the middle of the parish. The bay of Houg- 
whary, a few miles farther north, where, at an inconsiderable ex 
pense, a key or breakwater might be erected to protect small ves- 
sels while shipping or discharging such produce as might be ex- 
ported from or imported to the very populous district in its imme- 
diate neighbourhood. 

At a distance of about six miles farther north, at each end of 
the Island of Vallay, there is a safe anchorage. That at the 



1G2 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



east end of the island, if better known, might afford safety to ships 
in distress. 

At the Island of Lingay, ten miles farther north still, there is 
an excellent anchoragfe. 

The best of these are, during the stormy season, dangerous on 
account of the rocks, shoals, and breakers by which they are sur- 
rounded, and will only be sought for in cases of extremity and 
danger. In order to afford a chance of relief and safety, it is pro- 
per they should be known. 

Six miles to the west of North Uist lies the Island of Husker, 
about two miles long but very narrow. In this island there is 
likewise an anchoring-place. From its situation, and a short dis- 
tance to the west of it being clear of rocks, it would prove an eli- 
gible station for a lighthouse, which, in connection with that lately 
erected at Barrahead, would undoubtedly be the means of warn- 
ing many ships of the danger of getting embayed and wrecked on 
a dangerous coast. 

If nature has denied to one side of North Uist places of pro- 
tection and security for shipping, she has amply remunerated the 
deficiency to the other. The south-east coast is very bold, bound- 
ed all along by the range of hills or mountains already described, 
except where intersected by inlets of the sea. These inlets, situated 
at nearly regular distances of six miles from each other, form 
safe and"commodious harbours. That farthest north, situated at 
the boundary of the parish in that direction, is Cheesebay, a har- 
bour of easy access from the south-east, and safe for vessels of any 
burden at all seasons of the year. 

South of this is Lochmaddy, which, by the rising ground on either 
side, and the numerous islands it contains, forms not a harbour 
only, but harbours, numerous, safe, and capacious, sufficient to sup- 
ply' accommodation for almost any amount of shipping. It likewise 
affords an admirable outlet for vessels going either north or south. 
It is well-known and is much frequented. It derives its name 
from three bold rocks, called Madies or dogs, nearly in a line, a 
little beyond the entrance of the harbour. Two of these rocks 
are decidedly basaltic, rising precipitously from the deep to the 
height of about eighty feet ; and although within 100 yards of the 
coast they are of a character and species totally different from any 
rock along its shores. As lighthouses are, in this age, fortunately 
multiplying for the encouragement of commerce, and the safety of 
human life, few stations are more suitable than Maddy More, the

highest of the basaltic pillars mentioned, which points to, or ra- 
ther is at the very entrance of one of the finest harbours in Scot- 
land. South of this is Loch-west, which extends six miles into the 
country. The entrance is narrow, but the anchoring-ground safe, 
and would undoubtedly be more frequented, did not its more capa- 
cious and better-known neighbour, Lochmaddy, almost monopolize 
the trade. 

Southward still is the harbour of Rhueva, which, likewise, is very 
narrow at its inlet, but safe when entered. And lastly, at the 
southern extremity of the parish, is the harbour of Keallin, formed 
by the point of the same name and the Island of Ronay. It is 
considered safe for vessels of no large burden. 

The grounds along these harbours, generally barren and mossy, 
afford no idea of the fertility and beauty which the west side pre- 
sents. 

Islands. — About two miles from North Uist, and to the north 
of it, lies Boveray, an island a mile and a-half long and half-a mile 
broad. It is very fertile, supporting thirty families in comfort equal 
to that possessed by others of their class in this part of the coun- 
try. Further south, and adjoining the main-land of North Uist, 
is Orinsay, about half-a mile long, and insulated only at high water. 
Of this description there are several along the west and south- 
west coast of the parish. Four miles from this coast to the west- 
ward lies Vallay, likewise an island at high water, and separated 
from the shore by a spacious strand of nearly two miles, which is dry 
withm two hours of high water, and at low neap-tides is not covered by 
the sea. It is two miles long, and about a quarter of a mile broad ; 
nearly the whole of it sandy. It is beautiful in pasture, and fer- 
tile in crops when the summer is rainy, but produces very Httle of 
either when that season is dry. The next- island is Husker, al- 
ready mentioned. The islands of Kirkebost and Illeray stretch 
along the west coast, both insulated only at high water. The latter is 
aboutfourmileslong; the former, or Kirkebost, is a mile long, but 
of no great breadth. This island was at one time of considerable 
value. It IS composed of the fine sand already described, and being 
exposed to the western gales, a great part of it was literallv blown 
away, and the sea now occupies fields which formerly produced fine 
crops of bear or barley. This destruction took place before a 
process now practised to obviate such a misfortune was known, to 
which we shall in the proper place advert. 

Along the south-west coast, the strand, dividing North Uist from 



16'4 



INVI'RNKSS-SrilRE. 



Benbeciila, is studded with a great cluster of islands of various sizes. 
Grimisay, the largest of these, formerly considered of little value, 
now supports 40 families. At the southernmost point of North 
Uist is the island of Ronay, which at one time was of littlevalue, 
but is now improved by culture, and considered one of the most 
valuable grazings in the parish. 

Besides those described, there are three islands or large rocks 
which lie opposite the west coast, and which, from time immemo- 
rial, have been attached to the farms opposite to them, in various 
divisions. These are still retained possession of, not for their pas- 
ture,— for pasture there is none,— but for the seals they pro- 
duce. In the proper season, under certain regulations, a boat 
is sent to each rock, the crew being furnished with large clubs, 
which they use dexterously. When successful, the division is made 
according to ancient rule, with scarcely a murmur or dispute. The 
proprietor is entitled to four, and the minister to one seal. This 
the latter receives not as a tithe, but because the glebe compre- 
hends a part of a farm which is entitled to a share of the rock. 

There are a great number of islands in the inlets of the sea ; and 
also in the fresh-water lakes. The larger and more important 
islands in the latter have become the principaVresort of the red deer. 

Diseases.— Ty\hus fever, formerly so fatal, is now hardly 
known. This may undoubtedly be ascribed to the change in the 
habitations of the people, which took place in consequence 
of the lotting system. Before this system was introduced, the 
whole houses on a farm, to the number of from 20 to 50, were 
crowded and huddled together in a manner most unfriendly to 
cleanliness ; but now, every small tenant has his cottage on his own 
croft, each at some distance from his neighbour's. The climate, 
notwithstanding, cannot be said to be unhealthy, and, though hu- 
mid, less rain falls here than in Skye, where the exceedingly high 
mountains attract the clouds with a force conveying them over and 
beyond this comparatively flat country. 

Hydrograihy. — We have stated that there are numerous 
fresh water lakes of considerable extent; with some of these 
the sea communicates at high tides. They are inhabited by a few 
salmon and trout of various kinds, and of good quality and flavour. 
Though there are no fresh water streams deserving the name of 
river, there are some inlets of the sea of great strength and rapi- 
dity. Over three of these, wooden bridges have been erected, 
which have immensely shortened the line of road.

Geology.— 'The chief rock in this parish is the stratified species 
called gneiss. Intermingled with this interesting primitive depo- 
sit, other rocks occur more or less abundantly in beds, veins, &amp;c. 
We trust, that, ere long, some one competent will be induced to 
visit us, and examine the numerous interesting geological arrange- 
ments of our district. 

Zoology. — The variety of aquatic birds along the coast, and in 
the innumerable islands of the fresh water lakes, is numerous be- 
yond description : there, thousands of the duck tribe build their 
nests and hatch their young. Of these the largest and most beau- 
tiful is the eider-duck, valuable more for its feathers than flesh, 
the flavour of which is coarse, fishy, and rank. The male is ele- 
gantly streaked with white along the s.ides, and the other part is 
a dusky brown, the last being the prevailing colour of the female. 

This kind, though now numerous, was unknown, I am informed, 
not many years ago. Besides those that rear their young on our 
shores, vast numbers emigrate and winter with us, such as the 
widgeon and many others. Swans, too, annually pay us a visit, 
and by their early or late appearance, the natives anticipate 
a severe or mild winter. The gray wild geese are inhabitants 
of, and hatch in, the islands and along the shores of the fresh 
water lakes ; whence in August, they come to the cultivated plains, 
in flocks of five and six hundred, and attack the barley fields. 
To obviate their destructive attacks, fires are lighted, clappers 
driven by the wind are erected, and some other devices used to 
scare them away. In winter, they are joined by innumerable flocks 
of the barnacle goose, and both are seen in flocks of incredible 
numbers. The green plovers in large flocks are here for the whole 
year, and also the curlew. 

The May fowls, a species of curlew, pay us a visit, and remain 
with us during that month. Moorfowl, snipe, and woodcock are 
inhabitants of our hills and moors, and pigeons of our caves ; so 
that to the sportsmen there is presented a great variety of amuse- 
ment, at all seasons of the year. To these may be added other 
animals, in compassing the destruction of which, the sportsman 
seems to enjoy no small delight. Of these, along the shore 
are the otter and the seal; and in the larger islands on the 
fresh wafer lakes so often mentioned, is a considerable number 
of red-deer. The mode of stalking the last is so peculiar that 
we are tempted briefly to describe it. The sportsmen ren- 
dezvous at a place previously fixed on, and each with an attend- 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



ant is appointed to a pass along the lakes, which he cautiously 
approaches, and when all are presumed to be at their stations, an- 
other party, with a small boat provided for the purpose, come up 
as quietly as possible. The deer, scared from their fastnesses in 
the islands,ake for some of the passes, and it very rarely hap- 
pens that a chance of a good shot is not afforded to some one or 
more of the sportsmen concealed under the cover of the heather. 

The black-cattle, sheep, and horses, which formerly were bred 
here, like those throughout the Long Island, were small, and a very 
great proportion of the sheep still reared are the indigenous breed, 
and of very diminutive size. Their numbers are considerable, but 
they never thrive so as to enable their possessors to sell or export 
anv of them beyond the island. Their mutton is deliciously fine-fla- 
voLired ; their quantity of wool, though very fine, is exceeding small, 
each fleece being from one and a-half to two pounds in weight. 
Stocking with sheep has been introduced lately in a few favour- 
able situations, and on a limited scale ; and they appear to answer 
well. All the sheep exported or sold from the parish, do not 
exceed from six to seven hundred. 

The breed of black-cattle has been immensely improved, within 
the last twenty years, by the introduction of superior Highland 
cattle and bulls 'from various quarters, at an enormous expense ; 
and in consequence, there are some stocks which yield to none in 
the Highlands, in point of unrted symmetry and weight. The cattle 
of the "small tenants, too, are on a scale of rapid improvement, in 
consequence of the liberal and wise measure which the proprietor 
some years ago commenced, and still continues, of giving premiums 
annually for the best bulls exhibited by the small tenant farms. 
There can be no doubt, that, by a similar regulation and encou- 
ragement, the small breed of sheep would be rendered more va- 
luable, and would amply compensate for the necessary outlay. 

The horses used by the tacksmen are of equal size and value 
as those kept for similar purposes in the south of Scotland ; and 
in general, the horses of the small tenants are of alarger and bet- 
ter description than formerly. 

We have already mentioned that the lakes are stocked with trout. 
In some of them with which the sea communicates, sythe and some 
other fish are found of large size and of fine quality and partaking 
in some degree of the flavour of fresh water trout The inlets of the 
sea are not very productive of many varieties of fish. On he east 
side are some good red or rock cod, and on the west, along the fords 



NORTH UIST. ]G7 

or channels of the strands, and on the adjacent shallows without, are 
very fine large flounder, little inferior to turbot. The great re- 
source for sustenance, particularly in a season of scarcity, is the 
cockle — a shell-fish of no large dimension, which is found in inex-. 
haustible abundance on the strands, where, on the retiring of the 
tide, hundreds of people are seen collecting them. They are an ex- 
cellent and nutritious food ; made up into stews with some milk and 
with a little bread, they form a principal part of the diet of poor 
people in seasons of scarcity. As an article of luxury, they form 
excellent sauce with fish of every description, and used raw they 
are little inferior to oysters. Besides this valuable shell-fish, there 
are razor- fish, spout-fish, welks, muscles, limpets, and in many parts 
lobsters, crabs, clams, &amp;c. 

The cockle, besides its importance as an article of food, is of 
importance in some manufactures. Its shell when burned forms 
the best lime known. In strength, it is superior to any other, and 
m whiteness it vies with snow itself. In a manufacture of kelp in- 
to soda, lately erected by Lord Macdonald at Lochmaddy, the 
cockle shell is used in place of lime. 

The quantity required for this, and used for lime in this parish, 
cannot be of less value than L.200 a-year. 

Botany.~\t is not our intention to enter into any lengthened de- 
tail on this subject, but merely to mention a few grasses and plants 
which are converted to the immediate benefit of the inhabitants. 
Amongst these the most generally and beneficially used is the 
bent, a grass which grows in the driest sand-banks to the heiaht 
of from one to two feet. It is very tough, and in some dea-ree 
elastic, and is used by the poor people for many purposes, such as 

mountingfortheircrooksaddlesandcreels,sacksfortheir corn, meal, 
&amp;c. It makes excellent mats for doors and passages. But its 
principal use is, to plant it for the suppression of sand drift. The 
wild spinage and wild carrot are used for food ; the tormentil 
root for barking leather ; the rue water-lily root and crottle, 
for dyes ; the hemlock, foxglove, tussilago, wild thyme, and tre- 
foil are used medicinally; the black and red slock or laver, found 
on the rocks, makes excellent soup; and dulse is used in a raw 
and boiled state. Here ve may mention also, a kind of earth found 
in the moors, used for cleaning metals, called moine nan urnud, and 
an earth termed dubhoch, used with other mixtures for dyes.

structive to corn at an early stage of its growth, is the grub-worm, 
against whose inroads no effectual means have been devised. 

At some remote period, woods undoubtedly had extensively 
grown in this quarter, although now no trees naturally grow 
in it. That this had been the case is evident from the fact, 
that the roots of trees are found in peat mosses, and, what is still 
more remarkable and unaccountable, they are found under high- 
water mark, nearly as low as the water recedes at spring-tides, im- 
bedded in black soil or moss, exposed to view in places where the 
sand, by the action of the sea, has been washed away. This is par- 
ticularly the case, on no limited scale, near my residence. From 
this circumstance it may be inferred, that tlie land must have 
largely extended its bounds beyond its present limits. This is 
still less doubtful from the fact, that several miles from the shore, 
moss is taken up on the flukes of anchors, where, covered by the 
sea, it could never have grown. But we must repress speculat- 
ing and return to statistics. An opinion had long prevailed that 
the sea-air prevents the growth of trees. This, in fact, is not the 
cause, but the want of shelter. Were the experiment fairly tried, 
there is not the shadow of a doubt that trees would grow in shel- 
tered situations, and from these the plantations might be extended. 
This was put to the test some years ago by a gentleman, who was 
then factor of North Uist. He planted a corner of a field in a 
well sheltered situation with trees, which have grown and continued 
to thrive beyond expectation ; and the black thorn hedge has been 
planted by another, which is flourishing. Neither of these is at 
a distance from the sea. 

II. — Civil History. 
Amongst the remarkable characters connected, but not exclu- 
sively, with this parish, we may notice a class of persons who have 
passed away for ever, with the age and habits which encouraged 
and fostered them. In the last generation, every farm and hamlet 
possessed its oral recorder of tale and song. The pastoral habits 
of the inhabitants led them to seek recreation in listening to, and 
in rehearsing the tale3 of other times; and the senacliie and the 
bard were held in high esteem. As — to use the language of 
commerce — demand produces supply, so a number of bards arose, 
possessing various grades of genius and excellence. Amongst 
these was John MacCodrum, who lived in the last generation — 
a man in low circumstances, born and brought up in this parish, 
and who scarcely ever went beyond its bounds — who possessed 



NORTH UIST. 



169 



a poetical genius of the highest order ; and com}3osed in the Gae- 
lic language, the only one he understood, poems and songs on va- 
rious subjects ; some solemnly sublime, some pleasantly humo- 
rous, some bitterly sarcastic. Such is the rapid change that has 
taken place in the habits of the people, that productions such as 
his, which in former ages would have been repeated with delight, 
and handed down through numberless successive generations, are 
already, since they are not in print, greatly forgotten, and in a few 
years more will be entirely lost. 

Macpherson seized on the last moments it was possible to pre- 
serve the sublime and majestic Ossian from passing to forgetfulness. 

Lord Macdonald, the representative of the great Macdonald of 
the Isles, is sole proprietor of this parish. His ancestors posses- 
sed it almost from time immemorial, at least for centuries back ; 
indeed, since the time of the great Soraerled, Rex Insularum, the 
founder of the clan. And in ages gone by, some of the chiefs, 
and always several near branches of the family, lived in it. 

Parochial Registers. — No parochial registers were kept till late- 
ly in this parish ; and even now, the entries from the more remote 
districts of it are irregular. 

Antiquities. — In some of the burying-grounds, particularly in 
the island of Husker, anciently named lollen na Moinocli, or Is- 
land of the Monks, are found several crosses rudely cut on stone. 
There are also two stones or obelisks of large size ; the one at 
Balmartin, near the centre of the parish, named Caracrom, re- 
garding the erection of which tradition is totally silent. The 
other is opposite the island of Kirkebost. It is called clach 
mhore a chi, and is said by universal tradition to have been erect- 
ed to commemorate a battle of the same name ; but when or bv 
whom fought, I have not been able to ascertain. At Carinish, 
the south-west point of the parish, there is a ruin of large dimen- 
sions, called Teampul na Trianaidcy or Trinity Temple, which, bv 
the tradition of the inhabitants, is said to have been built by the, 
daughter of Lorn, when she was separated from the Lord of the 
Isles. I have in my possession a document, which is a copy of 
what is said to have been the original charter of dedication of some 
lands in Uist to the Trinity and blessed Virgin Mary Church at 
Carinish, by Godfrey Macdonald, Lord of Uist, in the year 1389. 
This, should it be genuine, does not contradict the tradition. 

Near the tops of two hills in this parish are immense heaps of 
stones ; some of them of large size. They are called barjis, a

word evidently not of Celtic origin. It may probably have been 
derived from barrow, a heap or mound. Be this as it may, the uses 
for which these immense piles were, with Herculean labour, put 
together, are now unfortunately unknown ; and, in the absence of 
. all authentic record and tradition, conjecture, at best uncertain, 
is all that can be substituted. Some, from their formation 
suppose them to have been Druidical circles or Temples. Some, 
that they were towers forming places of defence and protection 
at a very early period, against the incursions of enemies, while 
they likewise served the purpose of beacons to give warning 
to the inhabitants of the approach of danger. This conjec- 
ture is in some degree supported by the circumstance, that above 
Roudh in Harris, and also in Barra, there are similar constructions, 
but of less magnitude, and all so uninterruptedly in a line, that a 
beacon-fire lighted in any of them would be seen by all. It is, 
however, more probable that they were the tumuli of eminent war- 
riors. 

Modern Buildings.— Oihev remarkable buildings in this parish 
are the Danish forts or castles. They are generally built of a 
circular form, in the middle of fresh water lakes of no great depth, 
and accessible from the shore by causeways, some now, and for- 
merly most probably all, above the level of the water. Many of 
them have outer protecting walls. 

These duns, as they are called, are about twenty in number. 
They were occupied as places of residence by the more powerful 
families, after the Danes ceased to infest these parts. One of 
the m was built in Lochscolpeg, a distance of four miles from the 
parish church. Donald Herroch, so called from his having been 
born in Harris, a descendant of one of the Lords of the Isles, and 
himself a very powerful individual, occupied this dun as his place 
of residence. 

 The tradition of his tragical end is confirmed by a great variety of circumstan- 
ces. Some of his relatives, jealous of his influence and power, and desirous to seize 
upon both, along with his property, fell upon the following expedient to compass his 
destruction : — They employed an accomplice of the name of Paul, a low mean wretch, 
to put their intention into execution. On an occasion when many of his relations 
and pretended friends went to visit him, — after enjoying for some days his hospitali- 
ty, they proposed various athletic exercises for pastime. Amongst these, it was sug- 
gested to try who should leap highest, they knowing that Donald Herroch's strength 
and agility would carry the palm of victory. Paul had previously prepared a strong 
leathern thong, with a running loop or noose, right over thf place where the leap 
was to be taken, and at such a height that it might easily be reached. He was himself 
in the next apartment, — whicli was divided by a wooden partition from that in which 
the company were collected,— holding the end of the thong. Another accomplice was 
employed to give the signal when Donald Herroch leaped ; and Paul, at the moment 
Donald's head was within the loop, drew the thong with savage determination, and

Last summer some silver coins were found in a sand hillock, 
in the island of Boreray. They are various coins of James VI. 
and are in an excellent state of preservation. 

The greater number of the tacksmen occupy comfortable and 
commodious slated houses; and many of the farm-offices are of the 
same description. Besides these, the church, three mills, and three 
public houses are slated. 

The cottages occupied by the small tenants are, in general, 
annually thatched, at a great sacrifice of time and labour. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1801 was 3010 
1811 3863 
1821 4971 
1831 4603 

The diminution has been caused by upwards of 600 souls hav- 
ing emigrated in the year 1828 to British America; and, though 
a few have since followed their friends across the Atlantic, the 
population is still excessive. It is now considerably greater than 
it was in 1831. The census of that year we shall keep in view, 
in the following statements. 

The average of the various ages of the population is as follows : 

Males under 15 years of age, 911— females, 988 = 1899 

betwixt 15 and 30, 588 do. 625 = 1213

strangled him. From this circumstance he was called Paul na Hellidh or Paul of the 
Thong. His life was short. Revenge, which, in barbarous ages, takes a summary 
mode of inflicting punishment, soon overtook him. In a few weeks thereafter, while 
Paul was building a slack of corn, from the top of it he observed, at some distance, 
a person of large stature rapidly moving towards the place. He hastily asked those 
about him from what airt the wind had blown the day before. On being informed 
it was from the east, and a leading wind from Skye, he exclaimed, the person at a 
distance must be Angus, commonly called Aonas Fionn or Fair, son of Donald Her- 
roch, who possessed some part of Troternish in Skye, and that it was time for him to 
look to his own safety. At full speed, he fled to the church sanctuary at Kilmuir, a 
distance of about three miles. Angus saw him at a distance, and, following him with 
still greater speed, just as he was crossing a small rivulet that bounded the sanc- 
tuary on the south side, bent his unerring bow, and the arrow pierced Paul in the 
heel. He fell ; his legs in the water and the rest of his body on the land within the 
sanctuary, which to this day is called Shead Phnil, or PauVs Field. This field forms 
part of the glebe of this parish. It is immediately adjoining the church ; and the 
scene is pointed out about 100 yards from it, A blind man, a Chomhalt of Donald 
Herroch, is said to have taken a brutal and indescribable revenge on Paul, which 
put an end to his lingering life. 

The memory of Paul na Hellidh is still held in universal detestation, while the de- 
scendants of Donald Herroch have since his time possessed and still possess large 
farms in North Uist Lochscolpeg, in which is, or rather was the dun, where Do- 
nald Herroch was so barbarously sacrificed to the evil passion of avarice, was some 
years ago drained by a gentleman living in its immediate neighbourhood; and on 
the side of the dun he has erected a small octagonal b»\\dvng.

Of th ose above ninety, there are 2 ; and last month one man died 
aged ] 02 years. 

It has been already stated, that Lord Macdonald is sole proprie- 
tor of the parish. He does not reside in it. The number of fa- 
milies in the parish is 8e33. Inhabited houses are 797 ; uninha- 
bited and now building, 17. Number of fatuous persons, 9; 
dumb, 2; deaf, 2; deaf and dumb, 1. There are 3 blind, two 
of whom support themselves by their own industry. 

Language c. — The language spoken is the Gaelic, which the 
people speak with uncommon fluency and elegance. One- fifth of 
the whole population above the age of twelve years understand and 
speak English. Such of them as are in the habit of going to the 
south of Scotland for trading or for working, are fond of inter- 
larding some English or Scotch phrases with their own beauti- 
tiful and expressive language. This bad taste is confined to so 
limited a number, that it has but slightly affected the general cha- 
racter of their native tongue. There are only five individuals in 
the parish who do not understand the Gaelic, and some of these 
have made considerable progress in its attainment. It was for- 
merly noticed, that taste for song is, among the lower order, fast on 
the decline; so also is that for music, of which they were remark- 
ably fond. At funeral processions, which had been, and still are 
conducted with remarkable regularity, the pipes, in strains of pathos 
and melody, followed the bier, playing slow, plaintive dirges, com- 
posed for and used only on such occasions. On arriving near the 
church-yard, the music ceased, and the procession formed a line 
on each side, between which the corpse \\as carried to its nar- 
row abode. But the custom of accompanying burials with music, 
is now almost universally abandoned ; and there are some indivi- 
Juals — doubtless with good intentions — whose zeal has not been 
wanting to put down the practice. 

The people are remarkably cleanly in their habits. Though 
far from woods, their houses in general are more capacious, and 
in every respect of a better description than the habitations 
of many of the same class in more favoured situations. Many of 
these have their chimneys and their glass windows, and their beds 
boxed with timber at the back, on the top, and at both ends; 
and all sweep and sand their earthen floors daily. They dress, too, 
in a stvle superior to that of most of the islanders ; and are even 
fastidious in this respect, and will not appear in public places, 
without being well dressed. The men dress in kelt or cloth of

native manufacture ; and the women are seen to most advantage 
in beautiful strips and tartans of their own manufacture. Of 
late years, however, the cottons and calicoes of Glasgow, in se- 
veral instances, have superseded the native female dress ; and the 
straw bonnets have pretty extensively overcome the neat head-dress, 
the hair kept together by a single comb, and preserved from con- 
fusion by a slight kerchief. Neither of these innovations are im- 
provements, but the reverse. The ordinary food is potatoes and 
barley-bread, which are almost exclusively used among the poorer 
class. The small tenants of a better class use, in addition, some 
milk in summer, and mutton and beef in winter. 

The gentlemen farmers live genteely, comfortably, and economi- 
cally. The peasantry enjoy a considerable share of happiness. 
Their chief earthly anxiety is to pay their rents, retain their small 
possessions, and keep their families about them. The gentlemen 
are well educated, and add to their other comforts many of the men ■ 
tal enjoyments which the overflowing press of the age so extensively 
furnishes. The common people are sober, industrious, sagacious, 
and acute, full of curiosity and exceedingly inquisitive. They are 
insinuating and even artful in their address, obliging and peace- 
able in their dispositions. Those of them in more comfortable cir- 
cumstances are honest ; but amongst the poorer and more ignorant, 
some are addicted to petty theft. It is amongst the last class alone, 
that this vice and other immoralities more frequently are found. 
The greater part of the better sort are most regular in their at- 
tendance on religious worship and ordinances, and correct in their 
moral habits. In this last respect, the gentlemen farmers set a 
praiseworthy example, which undoubtedly has a happy influence. 

Smuggling has for years been completely abolished, not so much 
by the exertions of the excise, as by the wise and determined mea- 
sures adopted by the proprietor and his managers for the purpose.

Properly speaking, there is no undivided common, as the whole 
parish is the property of one individual. Such parts of the moor 
as have hitherto been grazed or held in common by the tenants of 
several farms, are now about to be divided, and its own share given 
respectively to each farm. 

Waffes.The rate of labour for farm-servants for the year is 
from L.5 to L. 9 Sterling, with victuals; and grieves or overseers 
receive from L.IO to L.15, with victuals. Country artisans from 
2s. to 2s. 6d. per day, without victuals. Masons and carpenters 
about 3s. per day, without victuals. 

Husbandry.— The number of black-cattle kept by the small te- 
nants is by far too great, and a less number well kept would un- 
doubtedly be more profitable. This remark applies with greater 
force to the number of horses kept. The evil arises partly from 
the difficulty of breaking off old habits ; but principally from the 
small subdivisions into which the allotments are reduced, the cause 
of which will be afterwards specified. Measures are now being 
taken by the proprietor to remedy the evil, in respect to both. 

On the character of the husbandry pursued much might be said, 
if the limits permitted. The occupiers of land may be divided into 
two classes, 1. The gentlemen farmers or tacksmen, each of whom 
possesses one or more farms ; and 2. The small tenants, who for- 
merly occupied their farms conjunctly, the arable land possessed 
in run-rig, or subject to annual division amongst themselves. In 
the year 1 81 4, a better system was adopted. The arable lands were 
measured and lotted ; and each small tenant put in possession of 
his own croft or share, while the grazing was left still in com- 
mon. This naturally gave a powerful impetus to improvement. 
The industrious was no longer clogged by the carelessness or 
sloth of his neighbour, nor by the consideration that the labour 
of the former would benefit the latter. On the contrary, the 
slothful was spurred on by the example and never-failing reward 
of the industrious. Accordingly, larger and better crops have 
been raised since. The manure principally used is the sea-ware 
f Alga marina, cast in considerable quantities on many parts of 
the western shores ; and where that is not the case, a certain quan- 
tity of the same weed cut from the rocks. I formerly took no- 
tice that the small belt subjected to cropping on the west coast 
is rendered productive by the sand that has been deposited 
on it. In fact, the most productive part is nothing more than 
mo,ss mixed with and decomposed by the limy particles of the 



NORTH UIST.

sand. The process nature thus pointed out was remarked by some 
individuals of sagacity and observation, who persuaded a few to 
follow this guide. In consequence, along some of the shores 
where the moss was washed by the sea, a certain quantity of sand 
was led to the moss in the immediate neighbourhood, which pro- 
duced crops in most instances sufficient to remunerate the trou- 
ble and expense ; and which renders what was before of small 
value, of permanent benefit as pasture ground. This improvement, 
by due encouragement, might be carried on to an immense extent 
by what we call draining and sanding moss. It is exceedingly 
facilitated by the cross roads, which almost through every farm 
have of late years been made. 

Some of the tacksmen carry on a system of husbandry, in every 
department of farming and grazing, which cannot suffer by a com- 
parison with the best managed farms in the south of Scotland, though 
labouring under many local and other disadvantages. Recovering 
lands from the sea by embankments has been carried on by various 
spirited individuals to a considerable extent, to the amount of about 
eighty-six Scotch acres ; and lakes have been drained, principally by 
the same persons, to about the same quantity. These improvements 
might be carried on extensively and advantageously in many parts 
of this parish. Another improvement, which has been tried in 
other parts as well as in this quarter, is what is generally termed 
the planting of stones in the sea for the growth of sea-ware. 
A great and important improvement also has been for some years 
extensively carried on, in the suppression of the sand-drift ; an 
evil formerly of great magnitude in these parts. The suppression 
of sand-drift is effectually secured, by sloping the sand-banks, and 
covering them with sward from the neighbourhood ; they thus be- 
come firm, and produce grasses of the same kind as in the situ- 
ations whence they were taken. Bent is also employed successfully 
for the same purpose. Very near the sea shore, and on extensive 
sand-flats, the planting of bent is the best method hitherto discover- 
ed for the suppression of sand- drift. 

Leases. — The tacksmen only have leases in this parish. Their 
duration varies from seven to fourteen years ; a period greatly too 
short to remunerate for the necessary outlay in making permanent 
and substantial improvements. Nevertheless, a number of the tacks- 
men on this property, have made most substantial and permanent im- 
provements, under the conviction, and in the unbounded confidence 
justly reposed in the justice and generosity in the Noble family of 



176 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



whom they hold, that they would be remunerated by long posses- 
sion, or by a pecuniary consideration. The small tenants have no 
leases at all. But amongst them, there are few instances in which 
they are removed from their possessions without a just cause ; and 
this unwillingness to remove them has powerfully promoted an ex- 
cess of population, and the subdivisions of crofts, contrary to the 
established regulations. To them, various encouragements for 
making improvements are held out. Premiums are annually given 
by the proprietor to the small or conjoint tenants who shall bring 
a certain quantity of moss or other land under culture. They are 
supplied with tools for making cross-roads through or along their 
farms from the shores to the moss ; and accordingly, there are few 
parishes, if any, in which roads, the first means to every improve- 
ment, have been, for a few years back, so extensively carried on. 
Far removed from the seats of manufactures and constant employ- 
ment, a great part of the time of these small tenantry is wast- 
ed, which might be more profitably applied. Early marriages, 
which have become habitual for ages back, increase the popula- 
tion in a ratio almost incredible ; and the croft or lots, originally too 
small for the first possessor, is necessarily subdivided amongst the 
married sons and daughters, and become totally unfit to supply them 
with the comfortable or even the necessary means of subsistence. 
In these circumstances, some means for their profitable employ- 
ment must be devised, or emigration encouraged ; otherwise, in 
years of scarcity, they must fall an intolerable burden on the pro- 
prietors, and those in better circumstances, or have recourse for 
relief to a generous public. Here it may be remarked, that the 
changes which have taken place in the incomes of the proprietor 
of this parish and other proprietors in the West Highlands, aris- 
ing from the low prices of kelp, in consequence of the removal 
of protecting duties from other articles that come in competition 
with it, — put it entirely out of the power of the proprietor, 
how generous and how liberal soever he may be, to extend relief 
when so largely required. The clear proceeds from the kelp alone 
in this parish, in 1812, after deducting every expense, exceeded 
L. 14,000; and for several years thereafter, it came little short of 
that sum. Now it puts little into the pocket of the proprietor, and 
in many instances is only manufactured to enable the crofters to 
pay for their small possessions. In these circumstances, is it not 
reasonable to expect that Government, who reduced the income of 
the proprietor from L. 17,500 to L. 3500, the present rental, by 



NOBTH U18T. 



177 



the change of law, and abolition of duties, is bound, if not to give 
a compensation, at least to give grants of lands, and afford facili- 
ties of locating on them, to an interesting class of people, at once 
moral, peaceable, loyal, and industrious, necessarily getting year 
by year less employment  While it is a source of sincere sa- 
tisfaction to narrate the well directed exertions of the greater num- 
ber of the large farmers, truth demands that some at least of the 
disadvantages and discouragements under which they labour should 
likewise be stated. Formerly, all the kelp ware on their farms was 
allowed them with their other possessions. For some time back, they 
have been deprived of this advantage. This, perhaps, from the pre- 
sent low price of kelp, is no great pecuniary loss. But another evil 
attends it. The small tenants are sent every summer to the farms 
possessed by tacksmen, to manufacture the kelp, with a train of 
horses, which eat up a large proportion of the summer grass. Not 
only is this iujtself a grievous loss, but it renders it impossible to 
divide and manage the pasture in'a systematic and profitable manner. 
The number of horses might be reduced, and in many instances 
they might entirely be dispensed with. Measures are now about 
to be adopted for the removal of this grievance. 

Fisheries. — The ordinary routine of employment, in which the 
generality of the people are engaged, precludes them from en- 
gaging in fisheries. In the winter season, the sea around jthe 
island is too boisterous to admit of their carrying on the fisheries, 
with any degree of regularity or success. During the summer 
eason, the most proper for this employment, much the greater 
part of the population is occupied in the manufacture of kelp, ia 
providing fuel, in cutting and securing crops. And, though many 
might be spared from these occupations, they want the necessary 
capital and skill to attempt to prosecute the fisheries with any 
reasonable prospect of success. Thus, though surrounded by the 
sea and its hidden resources of wealth, we can scarcely be said to 
have fishing. That large shoals of herrings and other fish annu- 
ally visit this coast, and ling and cod may be found in the proper 
season in abundance around it, which might be turned to profit- 
able account, can hardly admit of a doubt. Under this impres- 
sion, a few patriotic individuals attempted to form liberal subscrip- 
tions, in order fairly to try whether this might not be made avail- 
able for the benefit of the country ; but the limited number wil- 
ling to make the experiment, and the smallness of the sum as yet 
subscribed, render the result doubtful.

Kelp Manufacture. — The on\y branch of general manufacture 
carried on, is that of kelp. At an average, there are 400 fami- 
lies employed in this, from the beginning of June to the 1st of 
August. In wet weather, no progress can be made in it ; and dur- 
ing the dry weather they work hard, sometimes fifteen hours. The 
amount earned by each individual, during that ieriod, is small. Yet, 
as all the family work together, the sum becomes considerable, ave- 
raging about LA to each family. This work enables the class of te- 
nants to exist. With small possessions, without fisheries, with few 
cattle, and these of little value, if deprived of this resource, they 
are unable to meet their rents. 

Navigation. — There are eleven decked-vessels, varying from 
twenty to sixty tons each. The largest and some of the smaller 
were built in the parish. With the exception of the Packet, they 
are all employed in the local and coasting trade. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town in this parish, and the nearest for ge- 
ral beneficial purposes are those of Greenock and Glasgow, distant 
by sea about 200 miles. With the latter the principal intercourse 
is held, for supplying this part of the country with almost all the 
goods and groceries imported; while the exports to these places 
to meet them are so scanty, as to be hardly worth mentioning, with 
the exception, indeed, of kelp, which is wholly for the benefit of 
the proprietor. Were a direct communication opened by means 
of steam, the case would be far otherwise, as I shall show before 
concluding. 

At Lochmaddy there was, for many years, a post-office, under 
the name of Carinish : it is now converted into a sub-office to Dun- 
vegan. It is difficult to assign any good reason for this. From 
Lochmaddy a packet of sixty tons burthen sails, when the weather 
permits, twice a week to Dunvegan, the nearest safe harbour in 
Skye. Letters and papers are received in this place, in the surpris- 
ingly short time of four days from Edinburgh. This packet is 



NORTH UIST. 



179 



supported by an assessment, which bears heavily upon all classes 
of the inhabitants, together with a small sum allowed by the post- 
office. 

The internal communication has been immensely improved, with- 
in the last twenty years. There are now no less than eighty miles 
0 fgood roads. Of these nearly fifty miles have been made by 
the statute labour, and a heavy assessment on the occupiers of the 
land. With the extension of roads, the introduction of carts has 
kept pace; of which there are, at this moment, in the parish 180. 
From the rapid increase which has taken place in regard to 
this excellent improvement, it may be sanguinely anticipated 
that at no distant period every person able to keep a horse will 
have his cart also. The rootle, too, and the clumsy plough de- 
scribed in the former statistics, have given way to the modern 
plough. The greater number of the tacksmen use Morton's iron 
plough ; and every small tenant has a plough of a lighter descrip- 
tion, quite sufficient for his purposes. Including all, there are 
nearly as many ploughs as are families in this parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated near the 
centre of the parish, about fifteen miles from each extremity. 
The densest part of the population is within four miles on either 
side. It was built in the year 1764, when the number of inhabi- 
tants was comparatively small. It affords accommodation for no 
more than 400, being about one- fifth of the population within 
reach of it. There are no seat rents paid. 

In this parish, there has never been a manse. The minister always 
occupied a farm-house, with a farm. The glebe is worth about L.40 
Sterling. The proprietor pays L. 61, 13s. 4d. of the stipend, with 
L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The balance of L.88, 6s. 6d. 
is paid from the Exchequer, to make up the stipend to L, 150. In the 
northern section of the parish, there is a Government church, which 
was finished in 1828. In the south part of the parish or district 
of Carinish, is placed a missionary minister, supported by the 
Committee for Managing the Royal Bounty. It is hoped that, 
at no distant" period, this district will likewise form a separate pa- 
rish, with endowment for church and school. Excluding the Go- 
vernment church parish from the calculation, the average number of 
communicants is 490. This number includes the Mission dis- 
trict. Divine service is well attended at all the places of public 
worship. The population is wholly Presbyterian, with the excep- 
tion of two Episcopalian famiUes, and two individuals Roman Ca-

t holies. The people have very little money circulating amongst 
them, and in consequence the contributions for religious purposes 
are very limited. The collections for charitable objects are 
of small amount. To make up for. this deficiency, the people 
are remarkably attentive and charitable to the poor; and the pro- 
prietor allows L. 60, from the multure of the mills, to the most 
destitute. This private charity is almost the sole resource, from 
which the poor and destitute are supported. 

Education. — There are nine schools of various descriptions 
in the parish :— One parochial, with a salary of L. 34, 4s. 4d., 
and about L. 16 annually of school fees, of which only L. 5 is 
paid in cash ; the rest in produce. Two schools, supported by the 
General Assembly's Education Committee, of which one is in 
the Mission district, and the other within the bounds of the 
Government church. Each of these has a salary of L. 25, and the 
school fees may amount to L. 5, the greater part of which is paid 
not in cash, but in produce. One school supported by the Glas- 
gow Auxiliary Gaelic School Society ; one at Carinish, supported 
by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge : two other 
schools by that Society ; and four by the Gaelic School Society. 

Besides the above, there are two schools for females ; and pri- 
vate tutors are kept by some families. The people are most 
anxious to confer the blessings of instruction on their children. 
But six additional permanent schools are still required. The only 
inlets to general knowledge are the libraries attached to the Ge- 
neral Assembly schools. 

Fairs, — There are only two fairs held annually in this parish. 
One about the middle of July, the other the beginning of Sep- 
tember, — both for the sale of black-cattle and horses. 

Inns. — The inns in the parish are four. One at the packet 
station at Lochmaddy, another at Carinish, the opposite extre- 
mity of the island, and the other two at proper intermediate dis- 
tances along the road. 

Fuel. — The fuel universally used is peats, which in quality are 
far superior to any in the Highlands. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

We add a few observations on what appears best calculated at 
present, to promote the industry, and advance the temporal com- 
fort of the inhabitants. 

First, it is necessary to find some proper outlet for the excess of 
the population by emigration, and thus to increase he quantity of 



NORTH UIST. 



181 



land possessed by each family. At present, it is notorious, that 
there are no less than 390 families not paying rents, but living 
chiefly on the produce of small spots of potato ground given 
them by some of their neighbours and relatives. Subdivisions of 
this kind, from the purest motives of humanity, will and must 
take place. To force the people away, has been entirely repug- 
nant to the humane feelings of the Noble proprietor and his ma- 
nagers. A few years ago, when it was necessary to remove some 
of the inhabitants from a place where they could hardly earn a 
scanty subsistence, Lord Macdonald very generously afforded 
them assistance to emigrate to British America. 

Steam navigation, judiciously arranged and properly conducted, 
would in some degree supply the want of local manufactures, by 
affording facilities of export, and of communication with the south. 

No regular steam-boats are employed to ply to this quarter : and 
the failure of the attempts that have been made to establish them 
has arisen from the circumstance, that the boats were not well fit- 
ted for the kind of trade proper to the district. They should have 
been adapted to convey cattle, &amp;c. instead of being splendidly fit- 
ted up for passengers. 

In conjunction with the projected plan of sending cattle and 
other produce from the West Highlands to the Liverpool and 
Glasgow markets, were a steam-boat of proper construction for the 
conveyance of cattle established, to ply during the season alter- 
nately, along the west side of Skye, with the Long Island coast, 
and the east side of Skye with the opposite part of the main- 
land, — no doubt can exist that the speculation would succeed, 
and would prove extensively beneficial to these remote quarters. 
The great variety of other raw produce that might be exported, 
and the goods of various kinds required for the overgrown popu- 
lation, would, in a short time, create a trade which must inevi- 
tably spur the industry, and promote the .comfort of all classes of 
the inhabitants.

PRESBYTERY OF UIST, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. RODERICK MACLEAN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries, Extent, c. — South Uist is bounded on the north 
by a sound which separates it from North Uist, 2 miles broad, and 
which is dry at low water ; on the south, by the sound which se- 
parates it from the islands and parish of Barra, and which, in the 
narrowest part, is about 6 miles across ; on the west, by the At- 
lantic Ocean ; and on the east, by the Minch, which divides it 
from the island of Skye, and which is about 20 miles where 
narrowest, and 26 where broadest. Its length, from its boun- 
dary with North Uist to its southern extremity, including the 
island of Erisca, opposite to Barra, is 38 miles. Its breadth va- 
ries between 6 and 8 miles. Its superficies consists of about 137 
square miles. 

This parish consists of three principal islands : but there are 
others of smaller dimensions, the largest of which is Wia, on the 
south-east side of Benbecula. The principal islands are, 1. Benbe- 
cula, on the north, 8 miles long and 8 miles broad, of a round form, 
and separated from South Uist, the largest island, by a small chan- 
nel half a mile broad in the narrowest part, dry at low water, but 
which at high water in spring tides has a depth of about 2 fathoms 
in the deepest parts. 2. South Uist proper, 27 miles long, and at 
an average 7 miles broad. 3. Erisca, 3 miles long, and 1 mile 
broad, separated from the largest island by a channel 2 miles 
broad. 

Topographical Appearances. — All the west side of the parish 
Erisca excepted is low, flat, and sandy ; and the east side moun- 
tainous, hilly, and mossy. The highest mountain in South Uist is 
named Heacle, Heacam-hall, or Hecla, supposed to be so named by 
the Danes, from Mount Hecla in Iceland, perhaps from a similarity 
in their figure or appearance. It is about 2500 feet above the level 
of the sea, and lies between Loch Skipport on the north, and Loch 



SOUTH UIST. 



18.3 



Eynort on the south, extending a length of about 8 miles. It is 
formed of three distinct heights, that in the middle being the 
lowest ; — the whole, when arrangements may be made for such 
purpose, together with the lands on the west side, adjoining there- 
to, being well adapted for an extensive sheep-walk. The whole 
mountain-range is still a common for pasturing the sheep of the 
small tenants in the neighbouring farms, who, but for this indul- 
gence on the part of the proprietor, would, in their present state 
of poverty and destitution, be wretchedly ill provided with cloth- 
ing. The range of hills north of Loch Skipport and south of 
Loch Eynort, varying in height between 1200 and 1300 feet, cour 
tain good pasture for black-cattle, horses, and sheep, and are at- 
tached to the different farms on the west side. The moss, ex- 
tending from the bottom of these mountains and hills to the arable 
part of the parish, is generally deep, and furnishes excellent peats 
for fuel. Once the surface is dry, and that the peats are stacked, 
they resist the rain ; and though the stacks are as broad above as 
below, and not thatched or covered with divot, as in Skye and the 
mainland, the peats keep dry, and make excellent fuel. 

The only cave in this parish worth mentioning, is that at 
Corodale, on the east side, between Loch Skipport and Loch 
Eynort, close by the sea, at the foot of a lofty • mountain 
range. It is called the Prince's Cave, from the circumstance of 
Prince Charles Edward having, for some days, found shelter in it 
in summer 1746, from the pursuit of his enemies. Marshal Mac- 
donald, whose father followed the Pretender to France in that 
year from this parish, visited it in 1 826, and carried away some 
of the stones. 

The shore on the west side, as already mentioned, is sandy, 
with the exception of certain small rocky promontories, viz. Oron- 
say, near the sound of Barra ; Ardmile, about eight miles north of 
Oronsay ; Ardmichael, where there is a burying place, four miles 
north of Ardmile; and Ardivachar, eight miles north of the last men- 
tioned headland. The only headland on the- east side is the Point 
of Ushinish, which projects about l mile into the Minch. The 
east shore is all rocky ; and in most places where the rocks are 
not high or perpendicular, grow large quantities of sea-weed, used 
for kelp and manure; but especially on the shores of the three 
lochs, viz. Loch Boisdale, Loch Eynort, and Loch Skipport, which 
are excellent harbours. 

Climate.~ln this parish the air is generally mild and pure. In 



184 



INVERNKSS-SHIHE. 



Winter, when there are accounts of very heavy falls of snow through- 
out the kingdom, snow very seldom falls in great quantity, or con- 
tinues long on the ground ; indeed, for the last twelve years, there 
has been very little snow or frost. The prevailing winds are south 
and south-west, which are almost always accompanied with rain. 

Polar lights have been observed more frequently, and under 
more extraordinary appearances during the last two years, than 
during the memory of the oldest persons. They sometimes ap- 
peared of a deep-red colour, extending farther south than they 
were before observed by any person living, which gave occasion to 
the ignorant to say, that they prognosticate war and bloodshed. 
These appearances were always followed by rainy, windy, and coarse 
weather. 

It is matter of wonder to the people here, that the luminous 
meteor, called Will o' the Wisp, was never seen in this parish 
previous to the year 1812. Since then, it is seen very frequently 
every year. This circumstance has given rise to some supersti- 
tious ideas among the lower class. It is said amongst them, 
that a woman ;.in Benbecula went at night to the sand-banks, 
to dig for some rue {Galium verum, used for dyeing a red co- 
lour, against her husband's will ; that when she left her house, 
she said with an oath, she would bring some of it home, although 
she knew there was a regulation by the factor and magistrates 
prohibiting people to use it or dig for it, by reason that the 
sand-banks, upon being excavated, would be blown 'away with the 
wind. The woman never returned home, nor was her body found. 
It was shortly thereafter that the meteor was first seen ; and it is 
said that it is the ghost of the unfortunate and profane woman that 
appears in this shape. 

It is observed that the climate of this parish, though very rainy, 
is generally milder in winter, than that of the east and midland 
parts of Scotland ; although, in summer, it is not generally so 
warm and genial. Considering the very great number of lakes with 
which the parish abounds, and the inhabited parts being so flat 
and low, it is, on a superficial view, surprising how healthy the 
country is. But this may be accounted for from the prevalence 
of high winds, and the contiguity of the great Atlantic Ocean, 
which render the air more pure and salubrious than in inland parts 
of the kingdom. The most prevalent distempers are, cholic, in- 
flammation, rheumatism, asthma, cough, dyspepsia, and nervous 
fevers. Poor living and weak food very generally bring on sto-

macli complaints, enhanced no doubt by the general and excessive 
use of tobacco, in every shape, vfhen it can possibly be obtained. 
Notwithstanding this, there are many instances of longevity, be- 
tween 80 and 100 years. 

Hydrography. — There are not many good springs of water in 
this parish. The water is generally soft, and partakes of the quali- 
ty of the lakes by which the springs are surrounded. The water 
in the hilly parts is of a brown colour, being tinged by the moss 
through which it flows, but is found wholesome. It is pro- 
per to observe here, that a chain of lakes runs almost all the 
length of the parish. The largest, named Loch Bee, is about 
three miles in length, and a mile in breadth, being about two fa- 
thoms deep in the deepest parts. The sea enters this lake in 
spring-tides, so that it not only abounds in fine trout, but also in 
flounder and mullet, a most delicious fish, called in Gaelic, Jasg 
drimionn, which is not found in any other part of the parish. It 
is a sucking fish, with large scales, the stomach of which is Hke 
the gizzard of a common hen. The lake next in size to Loch Bee 
is named Loch Druidibeg, situated a little to the north of Heackle. 
It is very little inferior to the other in size, and furnishes a copi- 
ous stream of water to the principal mill in the parish. On this 
lake there are several small islets, on which there is plenty of gull,, 
goose, and duck eggs found in the months of May and June, 
every year. These islets were, some years ago, much frequented 
by deer ; but there is none now to be seen in the whole parish but 
one hind, the rest having disappeared, and found their way to 
North Uist. Besides these two lakes, there is an immense num- 
ber of smaller lakes on the west side, and in the moor of the three 
islands of which the parish is composed, especially the largest. 

There are only two streams in which salmon find their way from 
the lakes to the sea, and vice versa ; but the fishing is inconsidera- 
ble. The lakes in the moor abound in black trout of a watery, 
insipid taste ; but in most of the lakes on the west side, surround- 
ed by arable land, and having a sandy or muddy bottom, the 
trout are of a delicious flavour, weighing between one and three 
pounds. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks are of the primitive 
class. There are no ores, no marble, limestone, sandstone, or 
slate, with the exception of some grey coarse slate in a small 
island on the east side called Staslay ; but rocks consisting of 
gneiss, coarse granite, and hornblende rock. Some mica-slate

is seen in a few places. No fossils or petrifactions. The soil 
between the west shore and the lakes is all sandy for almost 
the whole length of the parish, varying in breadth between 
half a mile and a mile. The soil, in those parts lying between the 
lakes, and the moorland and hills, is partly black loam, and part-' 
ly moss. There is no clayey soil in the parish. The most fruit- 
ful soil, when well manured, is what is called mixed soil, consist- 
ing of black soil and sand. The soil is thin, resting over gravel 
or rock ; but produces good crops in favourable seasons. 

Zoology. — There are many kinds of birds which migrate to this 
country, and remain in it during the winter and spring, from Oc- 
tober till April, such as swans, barnacle geese, several species of 
ducks, teals, &amp;c. Besides these migrating birds, there is a vast 
number of wild geese, common wild ducks, a considerable number 
of eider duck along the western shore, cormorants, curlews, 
herons, sea-larks, sea-gulls of different species ; but of aqua- 
tic- birds, which never land, but may be seen in the neighbour- 
hood of the shore, the writer of this account is not possessed of 
sufficient information to supply a correct account. Besides 
these aquatic birds, there is abundance of pigeons, grey and green 
plover, larks, thrushes, linnets, and other birds common to the 
adjoining'parishes. Game consists of grouse, woodcock, and snipe. 
The carnivorous birds are, eagles, hawks, falcons, kites, ravens, 
hooded-crows. As to quadrupeds; — besides black-cattle, horses, 
sheep, swine, and goats, there are rabbits, otters, rats, and mice. 
There are no snakes nor serpents of any kind ; no lizards, toads, 
nor frogs. There is no species of fish in the lakes and streams, but 
those already described, including salmon, Salmon comes up the 
two streams already mentioned, to spawn, from the middle of Sep- 
tember to the beginning of November, and they return to the sea 
in December and January; but the months of July and August, 
and beginning of September, are the time when the scanty fishing 
is most successful. 

The coast, for several years past, at least the lochs on the east 
side of the parish has not been much frequented by herring. 
Vast shoals of this fish are, every year, seen on the west coast of 
the parish ; but from the want of capital, skill, and encourage- 
ment, the people are not enabled to take the benefit of them. 
Besides, there is a very great disadvantage arising from the want 
of harbours on the west side, and the impossibility of finding a 
proper landing-place when there is a strong breeze.. Though 



SOUTH UIST. 187 

the sea on the east and west side of this parish abounds with 
cod, ling, and other kinds of fish, the inhabitants, from the 
causes above stated, cannot avail themselves of this branch of 
industry ; and no fishing to any extent is carried on in the pa- 

•rish, except in the southern extremity, by a few of the Boisdale 
tenants, who, at an average, send about 28 tons of cod and ling 
annually to market. Since the Government bounty has been with- 
drawn, the fishing has considerably decreased. But such is the 
wretchedness of the labouring poor generally in some places, that 
this bounty, instead of being serviceable to the poor fishermen, 
went to the pockets of those persons who call themselves fish- 
curers ; and even now, the poor fishermen are compelled to sell 
the fish to their landlord, or the factor on the Boisdale estate, at a 
diminished price. 

About thirty years ago, there was a considerable fishing carried 
on in dog-fish and sun-fish or basking-shark. But since the bounty 
on the oil of these fishes has been withdrawn, this branch of in- 
dustry has been altogether discontinued. 

The most important and useful shell- fish on the shores of this pa- 
rish, is the cockle. It is found in great abundance in the sands between 
Benbecula and North Uist, and between South Uist and Benbecu- 
la. Great crowds of people, with horses and baskets or creels, are 
seen every summer, but especially in years of scarcity, picking up 
this shell-fish, as a most useful article of food, upon which, with a 
little milk, and sometimes without that addition, the poor people, in 

 years of scarcity, principally .subsist for two months. The shells, 
which make excellent lime for building, and particularly for plaster- 
ing, are sold at 4d. to 6d. per barrel. Besides cockles, there is plenty 
of razor or spout-fish, limpets, mussels, welks or periwinkles, lob- 
sters, and crabs. Oysters are only found on the shore of Loch Skip- 
port, and, being rock oysters chiefly, they are large and delicious. 

Botany.~lt may be observed, that a botanist would find very 
little to attract his attention in this parish, and nothing which is 
not also found in the other Hebridean islands. The grass on the 
west side of the hills is of fine quality, and well calculated to yield 
milk and to fatten cattle in summer; but from its fineness, melts 
away in winter with rain and frost. Owing to the number of small 
horses necessarily kept by the tenantry for carrying their peats, 
kelp, and sea-ware for tillage, &amp;c. their cows are not so well pas- 
tured 33 to be a profitable concern to the owners.

II. — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — The only land-owners are Ranald G. Macdo- 
nald, Esq. of Clanranald ; Hugh Macdonald, Esq. of Boisdale ; 
and Ranald Macdonald, Esq. of Bornish. 

Parochial Registers. — There was not a parochial register kept ' 
of the births and marriages among the Protestant population, till 
within the last two years. Two-thirds of the population are Ro- 
man Catholics ; and, without an act of Parliament, it is impossible 
to keep a regular register of the whole population in a parish so 
circumstanced. 

Antiquities. — In the island of Benbecula, there was a nunnery 
on the farm now called Nuntown. The building was taken down, 
and the stones used in the building of Clanranald's mansion and 
office-houses. About two miles to the north of the site of the 
nunnery, on a farm called Bailivanich, or the farm of the monks, 
still stand the remains of the monastery on a small islet in a lake. 
There are also at Benbecula, on the west side, the remains of an old 
castle named Caistal Bhuirbh, or the Castle of Borve, a very an- 
cient building, the residence of the lairds of Benbecula in ancient 
times. There is no tradition in regard to the time or person by 
whom it was built. In Loch Druidibeg, one of the lakes already 
mentioned, is an islet or rock, on which appear the remains of a 
building, evidently erected in ancient times as a place of refuge from 
barbarous incursions. There is also on a small islet in a lake near 
Hoghmore, where the parish church is to be built, a small square 
building almost entire, named Caistal Eilen bheg rum, signifying 
the castle in the island of small dimensions, in which the captain or 
Clanranald resided with his family of old, when he dreaded inva- 
sion from his neighbouring foes. There was on a rock of consider- 
able elevation, in a small island in the southern extremity of the 
parish, near Eriscay, and opposite to Barra, a very ancient build- 
ing, named Caistal a Bhrebider, or the Weaver's Castle, a part of 
which still stands, and which, as it was built on a rock of consider- 
able elevation, is still a conspicuous object at the distance of a 
few miles. A part of the wall lately fell. A better place for de- 
fence could scarcely have been selected. 

Modern Buildings. — The modern buildings are, two churches 
or chapels in the missionary districts of Benbecula and Boisdale : 
— three chapels built by, and at the expense of, the Roman Catho- 
lic population ; also, — it may be stated in the account of a parish 
-like this, — three farm-houses, erected within the last five years, 



SOUTH UIST. 



189 



all substantially built of stone and lime, and slated. There are 
four mills in the parish built of the same materials, and supplied 
with good machinery and copious waterfalls. 

III. — Population. 
From the reports of old people in the parish, it is believed that 
the population must have more than doubled during the last cen- 
tury, notwithstanding the frequent emigrations which have taken 
place to North America since the year 1772. The increase has 
been owing to early and improvident marriages, the healthiness of 
the climate, and the facility of parents in giving to their sons a por- 
tion of their lands, small enough for their own subsistence. There 
are no towns, villages, or hamlets in the parish. 

Mr Macdonald of Bornish is the only resident heritor. Four- 
fifths of the lands belong to Clanranald, whose rental is about 
L.4500 ; Boisdale's, L.900 ; and Bornish's about L.200. 

There are 17 bachelors, and 36 widowers, upwards of fifty years 
of age ; and 98 unmarried women above forty-five. Average num- 
ber of children in each family, 6. 

There are 17 persons fatuous, 6 blind, 4 deaf and dumb, and 2 
insane in the parish. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The language used by the 
inhabitants is Gaelic, which is spoken with considerable purity, 
and has not lost ground within the last forty years. The people, 
in general, are not cleanly in their habits. Their ordinary dress is 
the sailor's jacket and trowsers of home-made woollen stuff, called 
, cZo, or kelt. They use the hat and bonnet indiscriminately. The 
ordinary food of the peasantry is barley-bread, potatoes, milk, oat- 
gruel or brochan, and occasionally fish, and shell-fish in summer. 
In good seasons, they have abundance of bread and potatoes ; but 
there are too many cottars and poor people who have no employ- 
ment, and can find none, and are consequently a burden on the 
farmers, who not only supply them with patches of land for pota- 
toes, but also support them out of their stock of provisions, when 
they see them in a state of destitution. The people, both Protest- 
ants and Catholics, are really very kind to the poor, which is a 
fortunate circumstance, as there are no parochial funds for reliev- 
ing their watits. The inhabitants, in general, are a moral, well-be- 
haved set of people ; but it must be confessed, that petty thefts 
are carried on to too great an extent among a certain class of them, 
owing to the extreme poverty of many, the want of the wholesome

terror of a jail, and the great distance of the county town. Smug- 
glnig has been entirely put down by the proprietors and their factors. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of imperial acres on Clanranald's es- 
tate is 67,908, of which about 16,250 are arable. Boisdale's proper- 
ty consists of about 1 1,000 imperial acres, of which about 2500 are 
arable, and the rest all moorland, — a considerable part of which 
might be brought to a state of cultivation. Bornish's property con- 
tains about 1600 acres, of which about 260 acres are arable. In all 
there are 80,508 acres, of which 19,010 acres are arable, and the 
rest consists of mountain, hill, and moorland. In such an ex- 
tensive parish, it is impossible to state with accuracy what quan- 
tity of the waste land might be cultivated. For years past, 
the tenantry, particularly in Benbecula, and in the northern part 
of South Uist, have been bringing considerable portions of moss 
lands into cultivation. Roads have been made on some of the 
farms, from the west, or inhabited part, through the moss; by which 
roads the tenants carry manure to the moss, and bring home peats 
in return. 

There is, I believe, very Httle undivided common in the parish. 
A dispute exists between Clanranald and Bornish as to a servi- 
tude claimed by the latter over a considerable tract of hill ground 
belonging to the former. 

Great attention has, for some years back, been paid to the im- 
provement of black-cattle. There are in the parish some stocks 
inferior to none in the West Highlands. Some Cheviot and black- 
faced sheep have of late been introduced ; but the small tenants 
still continue the old breed of 'sheep : these are of small size, but 
the mutton is of uncommonly fine flavour, and the wool, though 
small in quantity, is very fine. 

Previous to the year 1818, the tenantry had their tillage and 
grass in common. This system was attended with ruinous effects ; 
the people were not so industrious as they have been since ; nor 
did they preserve their corn and potatoes from being damaged by 
cattle ; the consequence was, that the proprietors had to supply 
them with meal every year. The average of meal imported from 
1812 to 1818 for the use of Clanranald's tenants, is 1500 bolls. 
Since then, none was imported till last year; and in ordinary 
years a good deal was exported. This change was effected by 
the stimulus which the crofting system had given to the industry 
of the tenantry, by their crop being better preserved from cattle

and by some improvements in their mode of agriculture; The 
work formerly done by five men and five horses at the plough, 
is now performed by one man and two horses. It is not more 
than twenty years since the old plough with one stilt, named crom- 
nan-gad, was entirely discontinued ; and it was only a few years 
ago that the small plough called ristle, which was used for cut- 
ting the ground, to enable the other plough to turn the sod with 
more ease, was disused. Indeed, it is still used by a few of the 
tenants in strong sandy ground. Formerly, the tenants had all 
their potatoes in lazy beds, or narrow rigs, three or four feet 
broad, in ley strong ground. This practice is still followed. It 
was only a few years ago, that they began to plough the ground 
for their potatoes, and to set them in drills. The quality of the 
potatoes is consequently improved, and the quantity considerably 
increased. 

There are no trees in this parish ; but it appears that there was 
much wood in this country, in ancient times ; for in digging peats, 
branches of trees with hazel-nuts are found in several places ; and 
in some places at low water, in great spring-tides, trunks of trees 
are seen in moss in the sea on the west side, among rocks and 
sand. This evidently shows that the sea has been, from time im- 
memorial, encroaching on the land. It needs be no matter of 
surprise, that such changes should have taken place on the low 
flat western shore of this parish, the sand being from the edge of 
the sea drifted on the land, and then over moss, forming high 
banks, which in the course of time were covered with a sward of 
grass, and which subsequently, from the want of care on the part 
of the inhabitants, were broken up for folds for their cattle, and 
cots for their sheep, and then drifted in different directions. How- 
ever, though late, this sand-drift was in a great measure remedied 
in several places, within the last twenty years, as far as was practi- 
cable. In five or six farms, the sand-banks which were repairable, 
were, at great expense, covered with green sod, taken from the 
neighbouring ground, and in the course of a year, defied the 
strongest gales, and which, but for this prevention, would soon 
have been entirely blown away, and have left a barren desert; 
whereas, they are now covered with fine grass bent [Arundo 
arenaria, and afford both shelter and food to cattle. Another 
method has also been tried, on a small scale, to prevent sand- 
drift. Bent, or sand-grass, has been planted in two farms in the 
Dutch style, and found to answer the purpose exceedingly welh 



192 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



This bent is used by the parishioners in making sacks for carrying 
their corn to the mill, and for horse graith, &amp;c. There is a large 
sandy tract near the northern extremity of. South Uist, named 
Machar mianach, consisting of about 600 acres, which, for the 
last hundred years, has been of no use whatever, now partly brought 
into cultivation, being contiguous to abundance of sea-ware occa- 
sionally cast ashore. There were about 150 acres of it under 
bear or bigg last year, which, notwithstanding the inclemency of 
the season, produced about 500 bolls. If this ground, tilled last 
spring, were allowed to remain without crop for a few years, and 
if the adjoining part of 450 acres were brought into cultivation 
in succession in the same way, the whole now a complete waste 
would, in the course of a few years, be a delightfijl piece of ground, 
yielding abundance of fine grass. So backward were the tenants 
of the district to commence cropping this waste, under the idea 
that they should have nothing for their labour, that Clanranald's 
factor, in order to stimulate them to exertion, was obliged to pro- 
mise each a certain quantity of grain, if the crop should fail. 

Eeni. — With regard to the average rent of grazing, it is to be 
observed, that the lands are let according to the amount of black- 
cattle they are calculated to maintain. The average sum for a milk 
cow with a two year old and stirk, is L. 2, 15s. The grass rent 
of the sheep is included in this sum. 

Waes. — The wages of farm-servants are from L. 4, 12s. ta 
L.8. Price of butter, L.l ; of cheese, 7s. per stone, Dutch weight. 

The crofters are tenants at will, and have no leases : but there 
is scarcely an instance of any of them being dispossessed of their 
lands, unless when guilty of bad conduct towards their neighbours,, 
or gross immorality. The tacksmen, or principal farmers, have 
leases of fourteen years' endurance. There are very few enclo- 
sures in the parish, and farm-office houses are in a very indifferent 
state in general. There are fifteen slated farm-houses in the pa- 
rish. The principal improvements, as already stated, are, road- 
making, stopping sand drift, and bringing moss lands into cultiva- 
tion. Much land of excellent quality might be recovered from 
the water, by draining some of the lakes ; the largest of which. 
Loch Bee, in the immediate vicinity of the extensive sand waste 
before described, might, by an outlay of an inconsiderable sum 
of money, or by the labour of the tenants, now much in arrears, 
from the low price of cattle, be nearly all drained, — whereby a 



SOUTH UIST. 



193 



large stirfoce of fertile land, now covered with water, might be 
brought into cultivation, to the great benefit of the proprietor. 

The obstacles to improvement are, want of capital, want of 
roads to the moorland, and want of drains and inclosures. 

The sand, which consists of about three parts of lime and one 
of silex, is found to answer well as manure, when laid on moss, by 
which crops of bear and oats are produced ; so that if good roads 
were made through the different farms, from the shore to the 
moss, extending at an average for three or four miles, large tracts 
of moorland, with the aid of sea-ware and sand, might be brought 
into cultivation, particularly as the small tenants are beginning to 
use carts in husbandry, and as the quantity of sea-weed cast on 
the west shore is very great. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : — 

7,719 bolls of bear, oats, and rye, at L. 1 per boll, - L. 7719 0 0 

82,760 barrels of potatoes, at 2s. per barrel, - . 8276 0 0 

10 acres turnip, at L. 11, - - . - 110 GO 

23,000 stones meadow hay, at 6d. per stone, - - 575 0 0 

1 ,000 do. cultivated hay, at Sd. - - - - 83 6 0 

1 ,600 cattle, at an average of L. 3, - - - . 4800 0 0 

400 pigs, at 10s. - - - - . 200 0 0 

Eggs sent to Glasgow, at 2s. 6d. per 100, - - 625 0 0 

25 tons of cod and ling fish, at L. 20 per ton, - ' - 500 0 0 

1,570 tons of kelp, at L. 3, .... 4710 0 0 



Total value of yearly raw produce, L. 27,548 6 0 

The quantity of rye raised is but small, and confined to four 
or five farms. There are only four or five gardens in the parish. 
There are scarcely any cabbages raised by the small tenants, or 
any garden vegetable, or roots. The egg trade is carried on by 
young able-bodied men, who go about through the country with 
baskets, buying up all the eggs they can get at 3d. per dozen.. 
These are shipped off for Glasgow and Greenock from Locb 
Boisdale, Loch Eynort, and the Sound of Eriscay, in open boats,, 
of from 1 7 to 20 feet keel ; in return for which, the dealers bring: 
home goods, such as dye-stuffs, tobacco, cotton goods, crockery,, 
and some other articles of convenience. . 

It was only a few years ago that turnips were introduced. They 
are only cultivated on two or three farms. They answer uncom-- 
monly well; and I cannot doubt, that when inclosures become- 
general, they will be extensively cultivated. Artificial grasses 
such as rye-grass and clover, are only raised on two farms, where- 
they are found to thrive well. The want of inclosures is the great 



194 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



obstacle to this article of husbandry, as well as to turnip. The 
meadow hay is generally of very fine quality. 

Live-Stoch. — The number of black-cattle in the parish, includ- 
ing stirks, is 5254 ; of horses, 2145 ; of sheep, 7042. There are 
not above 100 goats. 

Manufactures. — Kelp is the only article manufactured in this pa- 
rish. While the price continued good, the proprietors were en- 
abled to pay high wages for the manufacture, and the people were 
thereby enabled to maintain themselves comfortably. But, by 
the taking off the duty on salt and sulphur, the price of kelp has 
been so much, reduced, that the article is hardly worth the mak- 
ing. In this way the value of the principal estate in the parish 
has been reduced from L, 15,000 to less than L.5000 a year. The 
wages of kelp -makers has been consequently reduced, and, indeed, 
the manufacture would not be continued at all, but to enable the 
tenants to pay their rents. The number of persons employed in 
the manufacture of kelp is 1872, including young persons of both 
sexes between twelve and sixteen years. It is a healthy employ- 
ment, and has no bad effect on the morals of the young persons en- 
gaged in it. In dry weather, the work is carried on at an average of 
eight hours a day. But the persons employed in burning the ware, 
and working it when burnt till it becomes liquid, with their irons 
fixed on long poles, have a very warm and troublesome task, and 
are often engaged for sixteen hours together. The quality has 
been much, improved during the last twenty years. The weed is 
allowed only two years growth before it is cut, instead of three 
and four years, as formerly, — which is considered by some peo- 
ple to be prejudicial to the quality and strength of the kelp. The 
wages have been lately reduced from L.3, 3s., and L.2, 12s. 6d., 
to L.2 per ton; the latter of which is still considered a fair remu- 
neration in good seasons, but very inadequate in rainy summers. 
The work begins about the middle of June, and is finished when 
the weather is propitious, between the beginning and middle of 
August. 

Shipping. — There are only four decked-vessels of small burden 
in the parish. They are chiefly employed in ferrying cattle to 
Skye and the mainland, and in carrying kelp to Liverpool and 
Glasgow. The custom-house of the district is Stornoway. 

Parochial Association. — There is a local Association in connec- 
tion with the neighbouring parish of North Uist, for improving

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is a good road the whole length of the parish, which is 
kept in repair by statute labour and commutation money. The 
nearest post-office is at Lochmaddy in North Uist, about sixty-six 
miles distant from the south extremity of the parish. The county 
town, Inverness, is distant 192 miles from the parish ; but the 
principal communication is with Glasgow and Greenock. Two 
fairs are annually held in the parish, at Ormaclet and Benbecula, 
in July and September, for the sale of black-cattle and horses. 

There are three principal harbours, Lochboisdale, Loch Eynort, 
and Loch Skipport, — to the first two of which there are good 
roads. Lochboisdale, near the south extremity of the parish, is 
one of the best, safest, and most capacious harbours in the kingdom, 
and is the'resort of shipping to and from the Baltic, in tempestuous 
weather. . Loch Eynort, near the middle of the parish, is also a good 
harbour, but has the disadvantage of being very narrow at the 
entrance, where there is a low flat rock in the middle covered 
at high water : in the inside, there are several excellent places of 
anchorage. Loch Skipport, about ten miles north of the latter, is 
as safe and good though not so capacious as Lochboisdale, the 
etitrance to the harbour being roomy, clean, and free of danger. 
There are three other harbours to the north of Loch Skipport, of 
inferior note, which are very seldom entered by decked craft, ex- 
cepting vessels receiving kelp. These are, Loch Charnan, Loch 
Shelliva, and Loch Uisgava. 

Ecclesiastical Stoe.— There is no parish church. About eighteen 
years ago, the late incumbent, with consent of the Presbytery, 
agreed to have the walls of an old house roofed and thatched, for a 
temporary place of worship, until circumstances should render it' 
necessary to build a parish church. Measures are now in progress 
for this purpose, as the present house is in a ruinous state. The 
church is to be built near the centre of the parish, about twenty 
miles from the south extremity, and eighteen from the north end, 
close by the site of the house now used as a parish church, and 
conveniently situate for about 439 out of a population of 6890. 

There is no manse nor glebe. The minister receives L.30 a 
year for these accommodations. A process of augmentation of 
stipend is still pending before the Court of Session, so that the 
amount of stipend cannot be stated at present. 

There are two missionaries in the parish, one at Boisdale, in the 
south part of it, and the other at Benbecula; They are paid out

INYERNESS-SIIIllE. 



of the Royal Bounty for the Reformation of the Highlands and 
Islands, at the rate of L.60 a year ; and L.20 a year is given by the 
heritor in lieu of accommodations. There are no catechists. The 
Catholics, who form more than two-thirds of the population, have 
three chapels. The bishop resides at Glasgow. The number of 
families attending the Established Church is about 354, of indi- 
viduals, 980. Divine service is generally well attended in sum- 
mer; m winter, such as are at a considerable distance cannot re- 
gularly attend, some of them having to travel nine miles to the 
church. The people are quiet and peaceable, and sectarianism 
has not obtained any footing among them. ''J'hose of the Esta- 
blished Church live on the best terms with their Catholic neigh- 
bours. 

There are no church collections, the people being so poor that 
nothing can be collected in that way for religious and charitable ob- 
jects. Attempts were made, several years ago, in better times, 
to have regular church collections for the poor, but they proved 
abortive. 

Education. — There are 10 schools in the parish, viz. 1 parochial 
school ; 2 of the Assembly's schools ; 2 from the Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge ; 1 from the Gaelic School Society ; 
1 from the Glasgow Auxiliary' Society ; 1 in the Island of Eriscay, 
supported by individual subscription; and 2 female schools for knit- 
ting, sewing, and reading Gaelic. Latin and Greek are only taught 
in the parish school and one of the Assembly's : in all, the female 
schools excepted, reading English and Gaelic, writing, arithme- 
tic, and book-keeping are taught. The school-fees are from 6s. to 
12s. a year, and, owing to the poverty of the people, are very ill paid. 
The number of those between six and fifteen years who cannot 
read or write, is about 600 ; and of those above fifteen years, 4148. 
An additional school is required in a place called Stonybridge, 
which is a populous district, and distant from any of the other 
schools. The people are not, in general, alive to the benefits of 
education. This is partly owing to their poverty and consequent 
inability to pay the school-fees, and partly to the necessity of their 
employing the children at work, and herding cattle. Indeed, the 
poor children in general are so ragged and destitute of clothes and 
shoes, that in some districts most of them cannot attend school in 
winter, which is the season of the year when they could most conve- 
niently attend. This destitution is very general, but is particularly 
observable at Ichdar, where there is one of the schools from the 



SOUTH UIST. 



197 



Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, which, for tliis 
cause, is very ill attended, although the district contains a popula- . 
tion of 756 persons. It is really grievous to see how ill all the 
schools in the parish are attended, owing to the causes above stat- 
ed, with the exception of the Assembly's school at Bailivanich. 

Inns. — There are four inns in the parish, which, with the ex- 
ception of one, are ill kept. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Forty years ago, the rental of the parish was L,2200 ; it is now 
L. 5600. The produce has been more than tripled since 1796. 
This increase is owing to the improvements in agriculture, and the 
necessity of rearing more cattle, and raising more crop, for a po- 
pulation nearly doubled since that time. 

The crofts are too small to enable the tenantry to rear good 
cattle ; and the number of horses kept by them by far too many 
renders it impossible for them to do justice to their cows. If the 
crofts were enlarged, by joining every two or three of them together, 
cattle of a superior description might be reared, and a better sys- 
tem of husbandry followed. But it is impossible to adopt such a 
plan, while the parish is overstocked with people ; and matters 
must remain in a miserable state, unless the surplus population 
emigrate, which they cannot do, owing to their poverty, unless Go- 
vernment send them to some of the colonies, free of expense. In- 
closures and drains are very much required ; and good roads to 
the moorland, through the different farms in the parish, would be 
one of the most essential improvements of which it is susceptible. 
A great deal might also be done, as already stated, by draining 
some of the lakes; by which, an extensive surface of excellent soil 
might be brought into cultivation.

PRESBYTERY OF UIST, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER NICOLSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Some have supposed tbat the parish derives its name 
from St Barr, who was always considered by the natives a the 
tutelar saint of Barray, to whom the principal Romish churches in 
the island are dedicated, and called Killbar. in honour to him. 
Nothing can show better the estimation in which this personage 
was held in the eyes of the people, than their having set apart a 
day annually as a holiday to his memory. On that day' 25th 
of September, all the Roman Catholic population convene in 
their chapel in the forenoon to hear mass, from whence they set 
off to Killbar, each man riding his small pony, with his wife or 
favourite lass mounted behind him ; who, after riding thrice round 
the sacred edifice, return to the place from whence they set out. 
The females provide, before-hand, quantities of wild field carrots 
for this occasion, with which they treat their partners. This 
superstitious ceremony, which has been adhered to for ages, is 
still countenanced by their priests, although they acknowledge 
that the Roman calendar has never been honoured with St Barr's 
name. But it must be observed that, by the intermixture of 
strangers with the natives, this ceremony is falling greatly into 
disuse. With due respect for St Barr, it is much more probable 
that the name of Barray was originally derived from its particular 
situation or bearing, i. e. from Ay or I, an island, and Bar, a point 
or top ; Barray forming the point or top island of the Hebrides. 

Boundaries, Extent, 8C. — The parish is formed of that cluster 
of islands lying at the south-west end of Lewis Islands, or the 
Western Hebrides. It is bounded on the north by a channel of six 
miles, separating it from South Uist; the islands of Cannaand Rum 
are the nearest lands to it on the east, distantabout twenty-six miles ; 
the islands of Coll and Tyrie, are the nearest lands to it on the 
south, distant about thirty miles ; and on the west it is bounded by 



BAURAY. 



the Atlantic Ocean. The parish consists of the main island of 
Barray, properly so called, besides several other islands of con- 
siderable size, amounting in all to upwards of twenty. About ten 
of these are inhabited, and the others used as grazings. The 
main island of Barray is about 12 miles in length, but varying in 
breadth from 6 to 3 miles, being much indented by bays and arms 
of the sea, principally on the east side. The other islands vary in 
extent from 4 acres to 1800 acres. Those to the south-west 
stretch out in one line from the mainland to Berneray or Barray- 
head, about 15 miles. The currents and tides run with great ra- 
pidity between these islands, increased by the immense swell from 
the Atlantic Ocean, so as to render the intercourse betwixt them 
and the other islands not only hazardous, but at times impossible. 

Topographical Appearances. — Although Barray cannot boast of 
high mountains, yet there are some of considerable height, yield- 
ing fine pasture to their very tops, with very httle heather inter- 
mixed. And though, at first sight, the aspect of the island appears 
rocky in the eyes of a stranger, yet, upon a more minute examina- 
tion, it will be found interspersed with pleasant and fruitful hol- 
lows and valleys, together with some low rich meadow land. In- 
deed, the whole island, as well as its numerous appendage islets, 
yield to no other place of their extent in the Highlands of Scot- 
land, for pasture of every description., The west coast of the island, 
with the exception of two or three sandy bays, is defended against 
the powerful attacks of the Atlantic billows, by a barrier of im- 
mense rocks, many of which are, by the constant action of the 
waves upon them, excavated into a variety of deep caves and dread- 
ful fissures, some of which are so very steep as to render it impossible 
for any person, not possessed of strong nerves, to look down from 
the top of the rock to the frightful gulf below. The islands of 
Berneray and Mingalay are particularly distinguished for the height 
of their rocks. That immediately below the light-house, erected 
a few years since, at Berneray or Barray-head, is about 700 feet 
above the level of the sea, and there is another rock in the adja- 
cent island of Mingalay reckoned to be 1 400 feet of perpendi- 
cular height. The extent of the parish from Scirrival, the most 
northerly point of the main island, to Berneray, the most southerly 
island belonging thereto, may be estimated about 28 miles, includ- 
mg the different channels intervening. On the east shore, the 
land is rocky, with heath and moss, with the exception of one great 
bay, which is sandy, as also some of the land to the north. . The 



200 



INVERNESS-SHIUE. 



west shore is both rocky and sandy. The principal bays are on 
the east side, and constitute excellent and safe harbours for ship- 
ping, such as Bayhierava or inland bay, Uilevay, Castlebay, 
Watersaybay, Flodday sound, and Ottirvore. All these are enter- 
ed from the east. The principal headland in Barray is Berneray 
or Barray-head, from whence many ships steer their course for 
America. The names of the larger islands of which the parish of 
Barray is formed, and which are mostly inhabited, are as follows : 
Watersay, Sanderay, Pabbay, Mingalay, and Berneray to the 
south ; Flodday, Hellisay, Gighay, Uidhay, and several others of 
a smaller description, not inhabited, to the east and north-east. 

Meteorology. — The most prevalent winds in Barray, as well as 
in the rest of the Western Isles, are south-west and north-west. 
The most violent gales that blow are generally from the south- 
west, and their dreadful effects are visible on such parts of the 
islands as are composed of loose drifting sand, and exposed to the 
Atlantic gales. There, the sand is driven to and fro by every suc- 
cessive gale, leaving nothing behind but the rocky skeletons of 
granite or whinstone, where once the ground was clothed with a 
beautiful variety of red and white natural clover. The same wind 
carries along with it great quantities of rain during a part of the 
autumn, and most of the winter ; but in the month of March, the 
wind occasionally veers round to the east, with cold dry weather. 
Due north and south winds are not very frequent, and rarely con- 
tinue above two or three days at a time. 

Although the climate is, in general, variable and fluctuating, yet 
it is far from being unfavourable to the human constitution, as in- 
stances of longevity have occurred here, as frequently as in any 
other part of Scotland ; and there are still to be found in the pa- 
rish a few who have exceeded a hundred years, with all their men- 
tal faculties unimpaired. The quantity of rain that falls cannot 
with any degree of accuracy be ascertained, as no regular meteo- 
rological tables are kept ; but the quantity that falls in Barray is 
in general far less than what falls in any of the adjacent islands, 
perhaps owing to the lowness of its hills. The climate is, upon 
the whole, mild, from its being surrounded by the sea, and the 
reflection of the sun upon the sandy soil, of which a great part of 
the island is composed, to which also may be ascribed the early 
vegetation and ripening of corn and grasses. Sown hay has been 
cut down here in the month of June, and barley sometimes as 
early as the latter end of July or beginning of August ; and in- 



BARRAV. 



201 



Stances have been known of barley sown on the 20th of Jiine being 
cut down ripe in September. Snow and frost are Httle known in 
this island, and when they appear, seldom continue more than a 
few days at a time. The diseases most prevalent are rheumatism, 
fevers, croup, asthma, bowel-complaints, cutaneous eruptions, sore 
legs in consequence of frequent immersion in salt-water during 
the boating and fishing, and such other diseases as are the usual 
concomitants of poor living, want of cleanliness, and destitution of 
clothing. Besides the other various evils to which the inhabit- 
ants are subject, the want of a medical practitioner among them 
is not the least; neither is there any of that profession within 
twenty miles, to whom they can apply for advice, under the most 
distressing circumstances. The consequence is, that people are 
often cut off in the prime of life, who, under the management of a 
skilful medical man, might be spared to their families. 

Rainbows, halos, and polar lights are seen often in this quarter. 
It is universally admitted that the aurora borealis or polar lights 
make their appearance much more frequently in our hemisphere 
now, than ever they did in former times, and in much greater splen- 
dour. They generally prognosticate a change of weather from good 
to bad, or from bad to good. The halo about the moon indicates in 
summer rain, and in the winter snow or frost. As the south-west 
and north-west are the prevailing winds, when the atmosphere 
thickens to the west, it prognosticates rain and bad weather; but 
while the west keeps clear, no change of weather is apprehended. 

The Island of Berneray, anciently denominated the Bishop 
Island, and the adjacent island of Mingalay, are particularly dis- 
tinguished as already observed for the height of their rocks, and 
their romantic appearance in every other respect; but what adds 
greatly to the splendid scenery of these precipices, are the innu- 
merable tribes of aquatic fowls by which they are inhabited, during 
the whole of the summer season. 

These birds pay their first visit to the rocks on the 1st day of 
February, early in the morning, when they clean out the rubbish 
of last year's nests. Betwixt that period and the month of May, 
they pay cursory visits to the rocks. Early in the month of May, 
they lay their eggs on the shelves of the rocks, so close to each 
other that it appears wonderful how they can distinguish their 
own eggs from those that surround them. Each of these birds 
haa but one egg, and as soon as the young one is hatched, and 

INVERNESS. O 



INVEHNKSS-SHIRE 



gathers strength about the end of July, the old bird gets it upon 
its own back, and throws itself and the young one headlong into 
the sea below, from whence it returns no more that season. Of 
these fowls there is no great variety visiting the above rocks ; but 
few as they are, each tribe keeps possession of a certain division 
of the rocks, which its neighbours dare not approach. Thus 
from the bottom to the top of the rock, each keeps its own divi- 
sion. Nothing can possibly exceed the grandeur of beholding 
the myriads of these. aquatic fowls standing erect on the ledges 
of these precipices, sometimes three and four deep, with their 
white breasts and red bills, resembling files of soldiers standing at 
ease, and so very tame, that a person might catch them with his 
hands, were he able to approach them ; and when roused from 
their slumber by the firing of a shot, they rise over your head 
like a cloud of locusts, deafening by their cries, and darkening 
the sky by their numbers. The natives, at very great risk, de- 
scend into the rocks, and not only rob the poor birds of their 
eggs, but kill them for their carcase and feathers. The first 
they reckon good eating, and the feathers they sell for beds. This 
desperate robbery has cost some of the natives their lives. No 
less than two melancholy instances of this kind have occurred 
within a few years. It is hardly possible to point out a scene more 
worthy of being visited for grandeur and variety than that of these 
rocks, particularly during the months of June and July. St Kilda, 
so often resorted to by strangers, Coruisge, Cuiraing, or any other 
place on the coast of Scotland, cannot come in competition with 
the scenery of the southern isles of Barray, during the period 
above-mentioned. 

Hydroyraphy. — There are only four fresh water lakes in the 
island, none of which exceed half a mile or a mile in length, or 
doserve any farther notice, than that they abound in small 
black trout and eels, and have each an old dun built upon one of 
tlieir small rocks or islands. Neither are there any rivers or 
streams of consequence, as in a place so confined, and so intersect- 
ed by arms of the sea, rivers of any considerable size cannot be 
formed. Although the island abounds in springs of excellent fresh, 
water, yet there is none of any medicinal quality. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rocks in this parish are gene- 
rally of coarse granite : but in the Island of Berneray a quarry 
of granite has been discovered of a very superior quality, beauti- 



BAllKAY.

fully marled, and said to be inferior to none of the kind in Scot- 
land. Of this stone the light-house and its appendages are 
built. It bears to be dressed and polished in a superior style. 
The soil of this place is of different kinds and qualities, such as 
moss, light sand, light black soil, and meadow land. 

Zoology. — Barray can boast of no species of animals peculiar to 
itself, nor any birds but such as are common along the whole coast 
of the Western Isles. Deer appear to have been inhabitants of it at 
one time, from the number of their horns still found buried in the 
earth. No part of the west coast of Scotland abounds more in fish of 
every description than Barray, such as ling, cod, tusk, hake, turbot, 
flounders, together with the various other kinds that frequent the 
western isles ; and the coast is frequently visited by immense shoals 
of herrings, which the inhabitants seldom take the advantage of 
catching, for want of proper tackling. The grub -worm often proves 
destructive to the labour of the farmer, more especially in cold 
wet weather, and the caterpillar no less hurtful to that of the gar- 
dener. Various means have been resorted to for their destruction, 
but none, have proved effectual. With regard to shell-fish, no 
place on the western coast abounds more in this article of food 
than Barray. Here are to be found lobsters, crabs, clams, razors 
fish, muscles, welks, limpets, and the still more important shell- 
fish the cockle, constituting, in scarce years, a principal part 
of the subsistence of the inhabitants. Cockles are to be found in 
the sands of Barray in such immense quantities, that scores of horse 
loads may be taken up during a single tide, and the people con- 
sider them the most nourishing shell-fish on their shores. Some- 
times they eat them when boiled, out of the shell, at other times, 
such as have milk, boil it and the cockles together, making them 
into soup, which they consider a very nutritious diet. They com- 
mence the use of them in times of scarcity in April, and continue 
the use of them till the beginning of August. The people allege 
that the quantity of this fish found on the shores is much greater 
in scarce seasons than at any other time. 

Botany. — Under this head, little or nothing can be said, as 
there is no herb or plant in Barray but such as are common to 
every other parish in the Western Hebrides. Barray is as defec- 
tive in the article of timber, as any of its neighbouring isles. It is 
said that wood will not grow in any part of the Long Island, but the 
truth is, that no trial has ever been made. It is beyond doubt, 



204 



INVERNESS-SHI HE. 



that these islands were once clothed with Woods, from the in- 
numerable trunks of large trees still found under ground, even 
some of them below high water-mark. Certain it is, however, that 
young plantings will not thrive very close to the west shores, exposed 
to the sea spray ; but there are many sheltered spots in every island, 
where there is hardly a doubt that trees would thrive. As a 
proof of this, Colonel Macneil, the late proprietor of Barray, had 
a spot on the east side of the island planted vvith various kinds of 
trees which grew in a few years as well as could be expected any- 
where; but the proprietor transplanted them to the ground about his 
mansion house, where they had not the same shelter, and where 
the soil was light sand ; in consequence of which, they pined away ; 
whereas, had they been left where they were originally planted, 
they might in a few years have been large trees. This limited 
trial proves that it is not impossible to rear trees in Barray, by 
proper care. 

Fruit trees when lined to garden walls, thrive well, and yield ex- 
cellent fruit, but not otherwise. 

II. — Civil Histoiiy. 

As this parish was only disjoined from that of South Uist in 1733 
-34, there can be no historical account of it previous to that date, 
but as connected with South Uist. 

Dean Munro, however, who wrote his history of the Western 
Isles in 1540-49, thus describes Barray : " Not far from the Isles 
Watersay, one of the islets belonging to Barray, towards the 
north by twa myle of sea, lyes the Isle of Barray, being seven myle 
in lengthe from the south-west to the north-eist, and be north, and 
foure in breadthe from the south-eist to the north-west, ane fer- 
till and fruitful ile in cornes, abounding in the fishing of kielling, 
ling, and all uther quhite fish, with ane paroche kirk namit Kill- 
bare. Within the south-west end of this ile, there enters a salt 
water loche, verey narrow in the entrey, and round and braid with- 
in. . Into the middis of this loche ther is ane castle in an ile, up- 
on an strengthey craige, callit Kilclerin, now called Kismul per- 
taining to Mr MackNeil of Barray. In the north end of this ile 
of Barray, there is ane rough heigh know, mayne grasse and greine 
round about it to the head, on the topof quhilk ther is ane spring 
and fresh water well. This well truely springs up certain little 
round white things, less nor the quantity of confeit come, lykest 
to the shape and figure of an little cokill, as it appeared to me. 
Out of this well runs ther an little strype downwith to the sea, and 



BAURAY. 



205 



qulier it enters into the sea ther is ane myle braid of sands, 
quhilk ebbs ane myle, callit the Fraymore of Kilbaray, that is, the 
grate sandes of Barray. This ile is full of grate cokills, and al- 
ledgit by the ancient countrymen that the same cokills comes down 
out of the foresaid hill through the said strype, in the first small 
forme that we have spoken of, and after ther coming down to the 
sandes growis grate cokills always. Ther is na fairer and more 
profitable sands for cokills in all the warld. This ile pertaines to 
MacNeil of Barray." Nothing can show the credulity of the 
Dean more than this account of the cockles being formed in em- 
brvo on the top of a hill, in a fresh water spring, and thereafter car- 
ried down to the sea where they grow large. There certainly is 
such a spring yet to be seen, but no visible appearance of any 
thing like cockles forming there. Martin, who wrote about 160 
years later than the Dean, repeats the same incredible story of the 
cockles. 

This parish was surveyed in 1820-21, and plans drawn, when 
the superficial contents were found to be about 22,000 imperial 
acres, including the several islands connected with it. Colonel 
Macneil is the only owner ; but the property is now under seques- 
tration and in the hands of creditors. 

Family of Macneil. — The family of the Macneils have 
held possession of Barray for time immemorial. Martin says 
that when he visited this place in 1703, the Highland chro- 
niclers alleged that the Macneil then in possession was the 
thirty-fourth lineal descendant from the first who obtained it. 
Whether this account be correct or not to the full extent, it is cer- 
tain that the Macneils possessed these islands for a great length of 
time. In the Register Office a charter may be seen by Alexander 
Lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross, giving to Gilleownan, the son 
of Rodrick, the son of Murdoch Macneil, not only all the lands 
of Barray, but also Boisdale in South Uist, on condition of as- 
sisting the Lord of the Isles, as well in peace as in war, against 
all enemies whatsomever, men and women, by sea and land. This 
charter was given at Finlagan, in Islay, in 1427 ; and was con- 
firmed by King James IV. at Stirling in 1495, after the power of 
the Lords of the Isles had been broken down. The Macneils 
were of old a great terror to their neighbours, as, being expert sea- 
men, they carried 'their depredations to every creek in the West- 

 Since the above was written, tlie whole estate of Barray has been purchased by- 
Colonel Gordon of Cluiiy.

ern Islands, which might be a powerful reason with the Lord of 
the Isles for making them his allies. One of them in particular 
was remarkable for his activity and turbulence called Resary an 
Tartair or the noisy or troublesome Rodrick, who spared neither 
friend or foe, until at last he committed piracy on one of Queen Eli- 
zabeth's ships, when a reward was offered for his apprehension, which 
was at length accomplished with very great ingenuity by the tutor of 
Kintail, as may be seen more fully detailed in the former Statistical 
Account. Martin relates, that " the inhabitants of this and the other 
islands belonging to Macneil make application to him for wives and 
husbands, he names the persons, and gives them a bottle of strong 
waters for the marriage feast. Their usual address to him is, that 
they want a wife or a husband to manage their affairs, and beget 
him followers ; and he makes up the match without any long court- 
ship, for he takes what care he can that their circumstances may 
suit one another. The people preserve their sea-fowl by salting 
them with the ashes of sea-ware, by putting them up in cow hides." 

Parochial Register. — There is no parochial register kept in 
this parish, nor can we learn that any was ever kept. This may 
be accounted for by the parishioners having been, till of late, almost 
all Roman Catholics, over whom the minister could exercise no 
control. 

Antiquities. — There are several ruins of religious houses in 
Barray, some of which appear to be of ancient structure. The prin- 
cipal ones are at Killbar. Each of these has an altar of rough 
stones in one end, and the pedestal of a cross stands at a short 
distance from the buildings. These churches were dedicated 
to St Barr; and of old a wooden figure of the saint was stuck up 
for the adoration of the deluded people. This figure was dressed 
up in its best habiliments on the saint's anniversary, and we are 
credibly informed, that it was customary for persons proceed- 
ing on a journey to make some present to the saint, of clothes or 
linen, to insure prosperity to their undertakings. No trace of this 
figure is now to be seen. Numerous watch-towers are over the 
whole of the islands of Barray, — as also Duns upon every lake in 
the place, supposed to be built by the Scandinavians, when in 
possession of these islands. There are likewise many Druidi- 
cal circles, as they are designated ; but a Danish gentleman, 
who lately visited these parts as historiographer to the King of 
Denmark, maintains that they are of Scandinavian origin, and 
were intended by these people as places for their heathen wor-

sliip. In several of the islands are to be seen immense heaps of 
human bones : and we have been credibly informed by a gentleman 
of some Information, and a native of the place, that he had seen, 
on the island of Watersay, the entire skeleton of a trooper and 
his horse, where they had fallen side by side on the sand, with 
some pieces of the armour pretty entire, where the sand-drift had 
exposed them to \iew. Although this gentleman's veracity can- 
not be doubted, it is difficult to account for the fact. There are 
several tumuli over the country in which, when opened, were found 
human bones along with deer horns. 

The most entire and regular ancient building in Barray is 
KismuU Castle, the ancient residence of the Macneils of Bar- 
ray. It is built upon a small rock in the middle of a beautiful bay, 
Kilelerin of Dean Munro. The whole rock is covered by the 
sea at high water ; the castle is of an irregular figure, strongly 
built, with anchorage for small vessels on every side of it. It is 
about 60 feet high, with a square tower in one corner, overtopping 
the rest of the wall by many feet. Tradition says that delinquents 
were let down by a rope and confined there. Immediately over 
the entry to the castle, the gocliman or watchman stood all night, 
repeating some rhyme to keep himself awake, and throwing stones 
down over the outside of the gate through a hole made in the 
wall for the purpose, to prevent a surprise. On the area within 
the walls, the dwelling-houses were built, which, if we may judge 
by their size and appearance, must have afforded but very indif- 
ferent accommodations. 

In the centre of the area a large circular well is sunk ; but it is 
doubtful whether it was used as a reservoir for rain-water, or sunk 
for the purpose of raising water from beneath. The well is now 
filled up with stones thrown into it by the natives, in order to 
prevent accidents. Attached to this castle, at the entrance to the 
gate, there is a dock built for the galley, adapted to the exact 
length and breadth of the boat, and defended on the west by a 
strong wall from the action of the sea. Martin says that the na- 
tives informed him, that the castle was 500 years old when he vi- 
sited the island, and that it had then its regular officers and guards, 
keeping watch upon the walls to prevent surprise. 

Both coins and arms have often been found in Barray, but none 
of them have been preserved. About three years ago, in trench- 
ing the clergyman's garden, a gold medal, nearly the size of a 
half crown -piece, was dug up. It was cast for the coronation of 



208 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



Augustus, the second King of Poland ; but how it found its way to 
this distant corner, is not easily understood, unless we suppose that 
It belonged to some person on board of a Dutch ship which was 
wrecked on this coast, when on her way to Batavia, about the be- 
ginning of the last century, when every person on board was lost, 
including several people of rank. As th bodies of these men were 
washed ashore, it is more than probable that this medal was found 
upon one of them. 

Modern Btiildings. — The mansion-house of Barray at Eoligary, 
built by the late proprietor, is a most commodious building, situat- 
ed in a sheltered place, and surrounded by fields of 6ne improve- 
able lands, not inferior in quality or appearance to any in the 
Western Isles. The manse, which is very commodious, was built 
in 1816, but stands now in need of some repairs. A church was 
built a few years since, and can accommodate 250 sitters in the 
ground area, and is fitted for galleries to accommodate 200 more, 
if necessary. There are three other excellent farm-houses slated, 
and in good condition. A mill has lately been erected for grind- 
ing of corn, on a better construction than any that had been there 
before. There is likewise an extensive soda manufactory, which 
has been working for several years,' but it was found at last neces- 
sary to discontinue it, after it had involved the proprietor in such 
expenses as obliged him to sequestrate his whole property for behoof 
of his creditors, and now to advertise it for sale. Of late, a roost 
splendid lighthouse has been erected on the island of Berneray or 
Barray-head, the farthest south of all the Barray isles, with that 
beautiful granite found upon the island itself. The roof of it, as 
well as the houses built for the keepers, are all covered with sheet- 
lead. 

III. — Population. 

According to the church records the population of the parish in 1750 was ISSj

The increase in the population would have been very great, ow- 
ing to early marriages, and the reluctance of the people to leave 
the country for work in the south,— had not emigration to Cape 
Briton and Nova Scotia carried off the island a great many almost 
every year. In some years, several hundreds leave it for those places. 
At present, there are 278 families who possess lands, and 93 fami- 



BAURAY. 



209 



lies who hold no lands whatever. Of the last, 70 persons are upon 
the poor's roll ; 3 are fatuous : 4 deaf and dumb ; and 2 blind. 
The average of births, deaths, and marriages, cannot with accuracy 
be ascertained, for want of a parochial register, and from the great 
majority of the population being Roman Cathohcs. 

Very few attain the age of thirty before they marry, and some- 
times they enter into that state at twenty. This may account for 
the fewness of illegitimate children born in the parish, — instances 
of which are very rare. 

Habits, Sc. of the People. — The inhabitants are of the middle 
size, patient and hardy in enduring cold and fatigue. They are expert 
seamen, and considered the best boatmen in the Western Isles. 
No instance has occurred of a Barra boat being lost for upwards 
of twenty years, although boats are generally at sea both summer 
and winter. Gaelic is the language universally spoken, and it is 
very pure and still unmixed with many English words. The Eng- 
lish language has made little or no progress, because schools have 
been wanting. The people of Barray have no games or amuse- 
ments but what are common to the surrounding islands. Dancing, 
with music of the bagpipes, is a favourite pastime. They are not 
remarkable for cleanliness in their habits or dress in general, yet 
on holidays their appearance is decent enough. The men dress 
in jackets and trowsers of home-made or south country cloth ; the 
women wear clothes made by themselves, and, at times, south 
country droggets or prints. They wear a handkerchief about their 
head instead of a cape, and a petticoat about their shoulders for 
a cloak. The women are slovenly in their manners, and not very 
active or cleanly. The people are so very poor, that many of them 
are destitute of bed-clothes. 

Their ordinary food consists of barley-meal, potatoes, and milk, 
and at times fish, with which those placed in the more favourable situa- 
tions are abundantly supplied. All the fishermen export their cod and 
ling to Glasgow and other markets, and reserve such fish as is not 
marketable for the use of their own families. In very scarce years 
such as 1836 and 1837, they subsist, in a great measure, upon cockles 
and other shell-fish, with very little bread and milk. Under all 
these destitutions, it is surprising how contented they are with 
their lot. With regard to their intellectual powers, little can be 
said. Their want of education, together with their seclusion from 
the society of other countries, must confine the exercise of their 



210 



INVRRNRSS-SIIIRE. 



intellectual powers within very narrow limit. Still they are shrewJ 
and inquisitive, but too indolent and indifferent to provide for them- 
selves or families any of those comforts or necessaries of life which, 
by a little more exertion and prudence, they might easily acquire. 
They are extremely addicted to the use of both spirits and tobac- 
co-smoking. There are more spirits consumed in Barray than in 
any other place of its extent in the Western Islands. In point of 
religion, the natives, who are mostly Roman Catholics, are not 
worse than their neighbours of the same persuasion. They are 
regular in their attendance on their own worship, without, perhaps, 
bringing forth those fruits which such attendance should naturally 
produce. As soon as the congregation is dismissed, the inn is their 
common resort, where they dritik to such excess as often ends in 
a quarrel. The Protestants, who are comparatively few in nunv- 
ber, and mostly strangers from other parts of the Highlands, are,- 
with few exceptions, sober and industrious, and in their religions 
attainments, are noways behind their neighbours in the adjacent 
islands. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — By a survey made of this parish in 1820-21, it was 
found to contain 22,072,943 imperial acres, distinguished into 
arable, machir or sandy ground, hill-pasture, moss or meadow, as 
follows : 

•liable, . , 3921.9377

Mill pasture. " . 16139.5089 
Moss or meadow, . 470.9938 



Total, 22072.943 

As all the lands in Barray are let either in farms or in crofts, 
consisting of arable and pasture ground intermixed, it is not pos- 
sible to ascertain the exact rent of an arable acre. 
. Rent of Land. — The average price of a cow's grass depends 
much on the quality of the pasture, which varies much in diffe- 
rent parts of the parish. It may, however, be stated at L. 1, lOs. 
o;- L. 2 per annum ; that of a sheep, from 2s. to 2s. 6d. per an- 
num. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants receive from L. 4 to L. 7 per 
annum, exclusive of maintenance ; and women from L. 2 to L. 3 
per annum, besides maintenance. Daily labourers receive Is. 6d. 
in summer, and Is. in winter, per day, without maintenance. Ma- 
sons receive 2s. 6d. per day ; house carpenters 2s. ; and all country 



BARRAY. 



211 



artisans, such as tailors, shoemakers, weavers, charge according 
to the quality of the article wrought, or the labour bestowed upon 
it. The black-cattle of Barray are very good. The stock reared by 
the proprietor himself was considered as one of the best in the 
Hio-hlands. The small horses reared by the crofters are much 
esteemed, both for their symmetry and hardiness ; of these they keep 
too many, to the detriment of their black-cattle, at the same time 
that they find them exceedingly useful for the manufacture of 
their kelp, and for leading sea-weed from their shores for manure, 
although a much fewer number might serve them for every use- 
ful purpose. No regular sheep stock had been introduced into 
this parish until last year, and those who are the best judges are 
of opinion, that no place in the Highlands is better adapted for 
the rearing of sheep than Barray. The prices of black-cattle have 
been, for a few years back, less than they formerly were, and 
have varied so much every year that it is hardly possible to state 
an average price. Corn, meal, and potatoes, are all sold here by 
measure ; never by weight. The boll of meal consists of twenty 
pecks ; the peck contains 5 pints English liquid measure ; the 
country people, however, have a measure among themselves, used 
nowhere else, which they call an omer, containing two pecks. Po- 
tatoes are sold by barrel measure, containing 35 English gallons. 
Meal sells at Is. per peck, and potatoes at an average of 2s. per 
barrel. The imperial measure has not as yet been introduced into 
this parish, except in the case of spirits or other liquids. 

Hushandnj. — As the parish is better adapted for grazing than agri- 
culture, it cannot be supposed that the latter has made much pro- 
gress. There are but few farms fit for a regular system of agricul- 
ture, and these are now let to graziers, who seldom crop much of 
their ground. The chief part of the lands is let to small tenants 
in crofts, from year to year; and it cannot be supposed that much, 
improvement can be carried on in clearing or inclosing landj under 
such a precarious holding. Notwithstanding all the disadvantages 
under which they labour, they now turn their small patches of 
ground to much better purpose than they formerly did ; for every 
crofter has his own small plough and couple of ponies, with which 
he turns up his ground with much more ease and in a better style 
than under the old system with the machine called crom-na-gadd 
which required the labour of four men and three horses. By sim-; 
plifying their agriculture, the people are now enabled to raise a 



212 



INVEIINESS-SHIRE. 



sufficiency of corn and potatoes for their own consumption, un- 
less in very unfavourable seasons, such as the two last, when 
the most part of the Western Highlands suffered a destitu- 
tion similar to what they experienced. They plant their potatoes, 
m general, with the plough, when the ground admits of it ; and 
when it does not, they plant them with the dibble, and have returns 
of from fifteen to twenty. The principal manure is sea-weed, 
which they lay upon the ground at all periods from November to 
the end of May j but the earliest laid on always yields the best 
quality of potatoes. After their potato crop, crops ofbarley and 
oats succeed. 

Without giving the tenants a more permanent tenure of their 
lands by leases, making their crofts larger, and encouraging them in 
clearing, draining, and enclosing and following a more regular 
system of crofting than what has been hitherto pursued,— it is 
impossible to expect that any great improvement in their manage- 
ment can take place. The common buildings or dwellings of the 
peasantry are of a most miserable description ; the wall is formed 
of loose undressed stone, without mortar of any kind, the centre 
being filled up with common earth, roofed and covered over with 
divot and straw, bound together by heather ropes. There are neither 
windows nor chimneys. For the first, they have round holes in 
the thatch for admitting the light; and one or more holes on each 
side of the house, which are opened or shut, according as the 
wind blows ; and a hole in the roof for emitting the smoke of 
their peat-fires, which are placed in the middle of their bare 
earthen floor. In one end of this miserable habitation they live, 
with their cows and horses in the other, during the winter and spring 
seasons. The natives have little or no idea of cleanliness or 
comfort. They have seldom much furniture to boast of; some-- 
times not a chair to sit upon, a bed to sleep on, or bed-clothes to 
cover them from the severity of the night air; yet these very 
people resort to the dram-house as often as they can spare a shil- 
ling for that purpose. There are, however, some exceptions from 
this, in the conduct of those who have come to Barra from other 
countries. These have built for themselves more comfortable 
dwellings. They are more cleanly in their habits and dress, and 
far more industrious and of more sober habits than those they 
found on the spot ; and it is hoped that their example in this 
respect will have a salutary influence on the manners, habits, 
and industry of their neighbours. Under the late proprietor of 



BARUAY. 



213 



Barray, the people enjoyed every comfort consistent with their 
rank and situation in life. He was remarkable for his kind treat- 
ment of them. Another great obstacle to the improvement of 
their lands, is the manufacture of kelp, at which the people are 
bound by their holdings to labour during the summer season, and 
even sometimes to the end of August, the fittest time for the im- 
provement of their lands, and attending to the management of the 
crop in the ground. Although this article of manufacture was a 
source from whence the Highland proprietors derived great bene- 
fit while it sold at high prices, and employed the people at remu- 
nerative wages, yet it has turned out in the end ruinous to both 
proprietors and tenants, — whose dependence had been placed much 
upon it. The tenantry have thus been reduced to the utmost po- 
verty ; and are unable to pay their high rents, and still less able to 
betake themselves to any other country by emigration. 

Colonel Macneil, the late proprietor, while he resided in the 
parish, which he did for some years, made some useful improve- 
ments in the farm of Eoligary, which he kept in his own posses- 
sion, by draining and inclosing. 

Fisheries. — Barray is perhaps one of the best fishing stations 
on the west coast, and might prove, were proper means taken, 
a considerable source of wealth. The people at present are loo 
poor to carry on fishing on an extensive scale, from their in- 
ability to purchase or build boats capable of encountering the 
boisterous seas they have to contend with, or to provide sufficient 
materials for their fishing ; yet, under every disadvantage to which 
they are subject, they generally employ from 20 to 30 boats, of 
about three tons each, in the fishing, with five men to each boat ; 
but, from the smallness of their size, they are often unable to put 
to sea, or to carry on the employment systematically. They are, 
in some seasons, however, pretty successful when the weather is fa- 
vourable : and then they go with their own boats to Glasgow or 
Greenock, with what ling or cod they take. The people of Bar- 
ray were in former years very successful in harpooning cearbans or 
sail-fish, from which they extracted a good deal of oil, and receiv- 
ed a premium from the Board of Trustees for Fisheries ; but this 
productive source of wealth has been discontinued, from their in- 
ability to provide the necessary tackling; and although hundreds 
of these fishes appeared last season on the coast, no one was m a 
condition to take advantage of the circumstance. Barray was in 



214 



INVEUNEvSS-SIIIRl:, 



former times much frequented by great shoals of herrings ; but its 
lochs are now almost entirely deserted by that useful fish. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in this 
parish cannot with any degree of accuracy be ascertained, as the 
most part of the lands as already stated is let in small lots to 
tenants who require the whole crop they raise for their own con- 
sumption. 

Kelp. — The only manufacture now carried on in this parish 
is that of kelp, in which all hands, young and old, are employed 
for about eight or nine weeks, at L.l, los. or L.2 per ton, but for 
- which they formerly received L. 4, 4s. per ton. Kelp, which on 
former occasions, sold at from L. 1 6 to L. 20 per ton, is now re- 
duced to L. 2, 10s. or L. 4 per ton at market, from barilla and 
salt being used as substitutes for it. 

There are only four vessels belonging to this place, there being 
little or no trade to employ more. 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish. The 
nearest to this is Tobermory, in the county of Argyle, distant fifty 
miles by sea. 

, Means of Communication. — The only means of communication 
by post with Barray is by Dunvegan, in the Isle of Skye, where 
-the nearest post-office is established. There is, however, a re- 
ceiving-house at Lochmaddy, from whence the packet sails to 
Dunvegan once or twice a week. A letter from this must of 
course pass by the ferry from Barray to South Uist, through the 
whole length of South and North Uist to Lochmaddy receiving- 
house, and from thence by the packet to Dunvegan Post-Office, a 
distance by sea and land, including ferries, of not less than 100 miles. 
The Commissioners for Lights employ a small vessel from Barray- 
Head Lighthouse, to sail to Tobermory once a month with the 
monthly returns, as a quicker conveyance than by Dunvegan. 
The country boats, too, ply at all seasons of the year to Glasgow 
with fish and such other articles as the country produces; so that 
the communication with the mainland is pretty frequent. 

The harbours in Barray as already stated are extremely com- 
modious and safe, which should be a great inducement to the 
prosecution of the fishing upon a more extensive scale than has 
been hitherto attempted. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parochial church, which was built 
only a few years ago, is situated in the very centre of the parish, 



215 



pretty close to the msmse. It is about six miles from each extre- 
mity of the main island ; of course, convenient for the attendance 
of all the parishioners resident on the main island. All the seats 
are free. The manse was built in 1816, with offices and garden. 
The glebe is a grass one, sufficient for the grazing of sixteen soums 
of cattle. It is of considerable extent ; but much broken up by 
rocks and 'Stones. The present incumbent has, however, converted 
a good deal of it into excellent arable land, which yields good 
crops. Its value at present may be about L. 40 per annum. The 
stipend is one of those augmented by Government to L. 150, ex- 
clusive of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. There is one 
Roman Catholic Chapel in the parish ; the bishop under whose 
jurisdiction it is, resides in Greenock. The number of Protestant 
families in the parish is 65 ; the number of families attending 
the Roman Catholic Chapel is 306. Divine service is pretty 
well attended in the Established Church, as also in the Roman 
Catholic Chapel. The number of communicants in the Esta- 
blished Church may average about 70. Owing to the poverty of 
the people, no contributions are made for charitable purposes ; 
neither are there any collections in the church. 

Education. — The parochial is the only school now in the pa- 
risli. English and writing only are taught there at present,, although 
the teacher is qualified to teach Greek, Latin, arithmetic, book- 
keeping, and geography; but as the school has but lately been 
opened, there are no scholars as yet advanced farther than Eng- 
lish reading. 

. The salary of the parish schoolmaster is L. 26, exclusive of 
L. 2, 2s. in lieu of a garden. No school-house has been built 
as yet, but the school is accommodated in the meantime in a house 
which is not fitted to accommodate any tolerable number of the 
parishioners. The fees generally exacted are. Is. 6d. for Eng- 
lish ; 2s. for English and writing ; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
2s. 6d. ; Latin, &amp;c. 3s. per quarter. 

The number of scholars at last examination amounted to 40. 

The clergyman keeps a private tutor for his own family, who 
teaches the highest branches of education. There was formerly 
a school in the parish supported by the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge, which has for some time back been sup-r 
pressed, for want of requisite accommodations. There was like- 
wise a female school from the same Society ; but it is not taught 
at present, as the mistress has been superannuated for some years 



216 



INVEUNESS-SHIRE. 



back. To accommodate the people of this parish with the requisite 
means of education, three schools are required. 

Few of the natives can either read or write. Most of the Pro- 
testants who come from other places, are, however, able to read 
the Scriptures, either in English or Gaelic. The number of Pro- 
testants in Barray, when the present incumbent came to the 
parish, did not exceed 60 souls ; now they amount to about 
380. There is not, perhaps, a single parish in Scotland in 
which the minister is put to so much trouble and expense in at- 
tending to his ministerial duties. The Presbytery seat is about 
lxrty miles distant, exclusive of fords and ferries ; he has to tra- 
vel about 100 miles to the seat of Synod, besides ferries ; and 
the expense of travelling in the Highlands is very great. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor up- 
on the roll is about 70. The only fund in the hands of the 
kirk-session for the relief of these, is the interest on an heritable 
bond of L.400, left by two tacksmen, natives of Barray, which is 
distributed among them annually, according to their necessities. 
There is no church collection made, nor has there been any as- 
sessment for the support of the poor as yet resorted to. The peo- 
ple are, in general, very kind to their poor, who live in small houses 
of their own, where they are supplied by those around them with 
the necessaries of life, and thus they are prevented from begging 
from door to door, or even leaving the parish for subsistence. They, 
however, show no reluctance in applying for relief, nor do they 
consider it as any ways degrading to do so. 

Markets. — The only markets in Barray are held in the summer 
and autumn seasons, for disposing of the surplus cows and horses 
to dealers from the mainland, who carry them to the southern mar- 
kets. 

Inns. — There are no fewer than three inns in the parish, where a 
great quantity of spirits is sold, the effects of which on the morals 
of the people are most pernicious. 

Fuel. — The only fuel used in Barray is peat, which is procured 
from a distance at great expense and trouble. 

MiSCELLANEOTIS OBSERVATIONS. 

The face of the country has undergone a material change for 
the better, since the former Statistical Account was written. 

There are now excellent roads made through the greatest part 
of the Main Island, where a horse could then hardly walk. These 
roads were executed by the country people, under the Statute 



BARRAY. 



217 



Labour Act : and they form an improvement of the highest conse- 
quence, as without roads no other improvement can be carried 
on. 

The state of the natives is truly deplorable, when compared with 
that of every other place, where education has found its way. The 
introduction of strangers into the parish has, however, given a spur 
to industry, to which the old inhabitants had little or no inclina- 
tion, their time having been chiefly occupied by boating and fish- 
ing during the best part of the spring season, and the tillage of 
their lands having been left to the women and children ; in con- 
sequence of which, the proprietor had annually to import a large 
quantity of low country meal to support his people during the sum- 
mer season, so as to enable them to manufacture the kelp : they 
now raise as much corn and potatoes as will supply themselves, 
unless in very scarce years. 

The only way to render the people comfortable and industrious 
would be, to grant each tenant a larger portion of lands than what 
be presently possesses, as he could manage that with the same 
number of hands, and the same number of horses which he re- 
quires for the small lot ; and to grant the tenants a more permanent 
holding of their lands, by leases of nine or ten years, with stipula- 
tions for improvements, and other regulations. Rents should be 
paid in money instead of services, and such services as the land- 
lord requires ought to be commuted for an adequate sum in money, 
and every shadow of vassalage done away. Rents should be re- 
duced to a conformity with the real value of the lands, and ade- 
quate compensation given at the end of their leases for every use- 
ful and permanent improvement. The tenants should be encourag- 
ed to build more comfortable houses for themselves, and their cow- 
houses should be separated : and each tenant should have a kit- 
chen-garden attached to his house, well fenced round with 
stone wall. Another great benefit to the parish would be the es- 
tablishment of a more constant communication with the mainland, 
by means of a regular packet boat, — which would enable the peo- 
ple to hold more regular intercourse with other countries, and so to 
have some insight into the manners, habits, and industry of other 
people. Were these improvements attended to, and due encourage- 
ment given to prosecute the fisheries, there is hardly a doubt 
that this small portion of the Western Islands might rival in wealth 
and happiness, any country of the same extent in the Highlands 
of Scotland.

PRESBYTERY OF SKYE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. COLL MACDONALD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The ancient name of the parish is Ceilltarraglan. 
In the Gaehc language, Ceill signifies a burying-ground, tar, 
bottom, and gleann, a glen ; Ceiltarraglan then signifies a hurying- 
ground placed at the bottom of a glen, and no name can be more 
appropriate. 

The modern name of the parish is Portree, compounded of two 
Gaelic words, port signifying a harbour, and righ, a king, the 
King's Harbour. This name was given to the parish in consequence 
of King James the Fifth, when on an aquatic excursion through 
this riorthern part of his dominions, having anchored and remained 
for some time in the harbour of Portree. 

Extent. — This parish is about 17 miles long, 12 miles broad, and 
contains 204 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the pa- 
rish of Snizort ; on the south by the parish of Strath ; on the east by 
that arm of the sea which separates it from the parishes of Gair- 
loch and Applecross ; and on the west by the parish of Bracadale. 

Topographical Appearances. — It is an oblong figure, and none 
can possibly be more irregular, being indented in various places 
and at short distances by arms of the sea. From the southern to 
the northern extremity, a glen runs through nearly the centre of 
.the parish, and on each side of this glen, and along the whole length 
of it, there is a range of hills of various heights and dimensions. 
The most remarkable of these, is that which is distinguished by 
the name oi aite suidhe Fhin, the sitting place of Fingal ; where 
tradition says that hero sat, directing his followers at the chase. 

This hill rises with an ascent less or more gentle from the head 
of Loch Portree to the height of upwards of 2000 feet from the 
level of the sea ; and on the east side of the harbour of Portree, 
and nearly as high, stands the hillof Peindinavaig, the name of which 
sio-nifies the hill of protection. To the south of this hill, and to the 
north of Loch Shgichan, stands the hill of Beinligh, which is not 



ISLAND OF SKVR — PORTREE. 



219 



quite so high as those above-mentioned. On the south side of Loch 
Sh'gichan stands the hill of Glamaig, of nearly equal height with 
the hills of Cullins in its immediate neighbourhood. At the top 
of Glamaig, there is a green plot of considerable extent, in the 
centre of which there is a spring which discharges an immense 
quantity of the purest and most salubrious water. With the ex- 
ception of Glamaig, a part of the top and sides of which is 
stripped of the soil by the heavy rains and high winds to which it 
is exposed, these hills are covered with the finest verdure from 
their bases to their summits. They abound with small rivulets 
and the best springs imaginable. They afford good pasture to both 
sheep and cattle, and, from the circumstance of these hills being 
almost surrounded by sea water, the pasture is not only abundant 
but salubrious to all the animals which frequent them. On the 
sea side in different places, both on the mainland part of the pa- 
rish and in the island of Rasay, there are small caves of various 
dimensions. With regard to these, there appears nothing worthy 
of particular attention, excepting that they furnish places of re- 
sort to the wild pigeons and water-fowls, which frequent the sea 
shore. 

The coast of this parish is of great extent. Along the shore, it 
frequently rises into grand, lofty, and almost perpendicular rocks, 
towering towards the skies. In some places, and more especially 
at the heads of lochs, the coast sinks almost into a level with the 
sea at high water. 

When the sea admits of examining the coast, it appears to .be 
in some places sandy, in some muddy, in some clayey, and not un- 
frequently rocky. 

The principal bays in this parish are Loch Inord, Loch Sligi- 
chan, the bay of Belmeanach, the bay of Camistinavaig, Luch 
Portree, together with the Big Harbour, and Dry Harbour, and 
several small bays in the island of Rasay. 

In no quarter of the world is the temperature of the atmosphere 
more variable than in this parish. All the changes of frost, snow, 
rain, storm, and dead calm, are frequently experienced in the short 
period of twenty-four hours. As might naturally be expected, the 
variable and humid state of the atmosphere in all seasons of the 
year is found highly injurious to the human constitution, and pro- 
duces among the inhabitants many diseases, — rheumatism, asthma, 
fever, and consumption. 

Hydrography . — A branch of the Atlantic Ocean divides Rasay, 



220 



INVERNESS-SIIIllE. 



Kona, and other small islands belonging to Macleod of Rasay, from 
the great body of the parish. This arm of the sea runs along the 
whole length of the parish, and is of various breadth and depth. 
It has, at all times, a sufficient depth of water to make it navigable 
to a first-rate ship of war. 

From the immense quantity of fresh water discharged into it 
from the adjacent hills of Rasay and Portree, together with the 
great admixture of soil carried into it by the rapid streams rushing 
from the neighbouring high-grounds with which it is surrounded, 
the water frequently, and more especially near the shore, acquires 
a dark and reddish colour; but in the summer season, and when 
the weather has been for any length of time dry, the water along 
the coast is perfectly clear, and transparent as crystal. 

Near the shore, those arms of the sea, which in various places 
intersect the parish, are quite shallow, but as they recede from high- 
water mark, they acquire great depth, and a much greater degree of 
saltness ; but this latter quality is much less nearer the shore, from 
the immense quantity of fresh water which is discharged from the 
rivers and lakes which abound in the parish, and in its immediate 
vicinity. In this same channel, which divides Rasay and its ap- 
pending small isles from the main body of the parish, and more 
especially in spring tides, the current is most rapid in the nar- 
rows, and so much so that it greatly impedes, and sometimes alto- 
gether suspends, the progress of vessels sailing in a contrary direc- 
tion. 

Springs of greater number, and more salubrious water, are not 
to be seen in any quarter, than in this parish. In every season of 
the year, they discharge inexhaustible streams of the purest, the 
sweetest, and most wholesome water. Indeed, in the driest 
summer season, scarcely any of them is found to fail in furnish- 
ng an abundant supply both for the use of animals and of the 
human species. Though none of the springs is of any great mag- 
nitude, their immense number amply compensates for this defi- 
ciency. They are found on the very summits of high hills, — 
they are seen on plain and level ground, — they frequently issue 
from the sides of hills, — they make their passage for the most part 
through a vast extent of gravelly soil, which is the soil most pre- 
valent in this parish, — and they are seen sometimes to spout from 
the fissures of black and flinty rocks. There are six fresh-water 
lakes in this parish, — the whole of them of different dimensions, 



ISLAND OF SKYE PORTRIJE. 



221 



and the largest not above a mile long. With the exception of 
one, they all abound with trouts, — the fish of which is most nutri- 
tious and agreeable to the taste. Round and about the edges or 
borders, the water is quite shallow. Towards the centre, they are 
supposed to be of very considerable depth. 

The scenery all around these lakes and their vicinity, is most 
romantic and beautiful. In some places, they are surrounded with 
high and perpendicular rocks ; in other places, as in Rasay, they 
are fringed with clumps of natural wood, and from them may be 
seen the grand, the picturesque hills of Cullins, in the parish of 
Bracadale, and Store, in the parish of Snizort, so much, of late 
years, a subject of admiration to travellers and scientific persons. 
From a lake in Rasay in a clear day may be seen all the hills 
on the mainland of this parish, and to the point of Hunish, and all 
the expanse of sea betwixt and the Island of Lewis. The rivers in 
this parish are not of considerable magnitude. They take their 
source from' fresh-water lakes situated in the interior of the pa- 
rish, or in a neighbouring parish ; and in time of heavy rain, 
which, in this quarter, is of no rare occurrence, they receive a 
vast addition to their body of water, from rain falling on the high 
hills, rushing down the sides with amazing rapidity, and overflow- 
ing their usual channels and banks. These streams, meeting 
with obstructions in their descent from rocks, stones, and other 
superficial inequalities, often spread over a great portion of a hill, 
and, as they proceed, foaming and purling in all directions, they 
form one of the grandest scenes imaginable. 

All the rivers in this parish run in different directions, and 
discharge themselves into various arms of the sea. The only 
cascade worth mentioning, is that which falls from one of the 
lakes in the northern extremity of the parish, and is thrown from 
a projection of a rock many feet high ; and at the bottom of the 
rock, and betwixt the rock and the waterfall, several persons might 
walk abreast without being touched by the water in its fall. Thei e 
are other smaller cascades in the parish. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— hhoui forty years ago, Lord Mac- 
donald, principal heritor of the parish, attempted to work a coal 
mine, in two different parts of the parish. He was at the expense 
of getting a number of hands from the low country, experienced 
coll iers ; but, after repeated trials, from the smallness of the vein, 
and the great difficulty of working it, imbedded as it was under high 



222 



INVERNKSS-SHlllK. 



rocks and below high-water mark, it was ultimately discovered 
that the quantity of coal procured would pay but a small propor- 
tion of the expense incurred. The work was then abandoned, 
and has never since been resumed. In different parts of the 
parish, but more especially in the island of Rasay, there is a 
species of granite, which, though not of equal transparency with that 
of Aberdeen, is still of a very valuable quality. It is of a very 
hard consistency, and most useful, as mill-stones are made of it, 
which are most suitable for grinding oats and barley ; and with 
these, all the mills in the island and in the adjacent parishes in the 
mainland are supplied. They are found in large thick blocks be- 
low high-water mark, lying horizontally ; and after they are form- 
ed and dressed by a mason, they are sold at from L. 9 to L. 12 
Sterling per pair, according to size and quality. On both sides 
of the harbour of Portree, there are immense high and almost per- 
pendicular rocks, formed of freestone, which, though not of 
the very best quality, being rather soft, is used in building, 
and serves as guards for chimney-heads and corner-stones. But 
in the island of Rasay, there is a freestone of the best quality 
and in the greatest abundance. Some years ago, it was made 
use of in building a most elegant house by the late proprie- 
tor of that estate. In the district of Sconcer, there is an inex- 
haustible quantity of limestone. Both limestone and freestone are 
covered with different kinds of deposits, such as sand, loam, clay, 
but more frequently with gravel. 

The quality of soil most common in this parish is gravelly, though, 
not unfrequently, sheets of deep moss are interspersed between the 
hills. The soil in every part of the parish is wet and spouty. Even 
in places which appear dry, springs of the finest water are found to 
rise,, and consequently on the low grounds the grass is intermixed 
with watery plants and herbs, and these scarce furnish any food 
for animals. They wither and decay very early in the season. 

Zoology. — With the exception of some deer in Lord Macdonald's 
deer forest at Sconcer, there are no animals in this, but such as 
are common to all other Highland parishes. The breed of cattle 
is small but hardy ; and, for the most part, they lie out, exposed 
to the inclemency of the weather, at all seasons of the year. They 
are scantily fed in winter with straw, and, consequently, in the 
months of March and April, they are low in condition, and very 
much emaciated. As soon, however, as the moss grass, the kind 



ISLAND OF SKYE — POIITREE. 



223 



of pasture most common in the parish, comes on in the spring of 
the year, they acquire strength, agiUty, and condition. They 
are much looked after, and in high estimation with deal- 
ers in cattle from the southern parts of the empire; and when 
•pastured for any length of time in the south of Scotland or Eng- 
land, they grow to a much larger size, and their flesh is found to 
be superior in point of taste and flavour. The sheep in the pa- 
rish, till within the last twenty or thirty years, was the old High- 
land breed, very small in size; but the fineness of their wool ap- 
proached, or was nearly equal to that of the Cheviot sheep, and 
the quality of their flesh was far superior. The old native sheep 
of this parish are now crossed with the black-faced sheep of the 
outh country, and have degenerated much from the original 
stock, both in regard to flesh and wool, though they have certainly 
improved much in size. The horses possessed by the small te- 
nants are very small, but hardy; easily fed; and never housed 
in. winter. They are served with little hand-feeding in the fields, 
and still they maintain their condition, so as to be able to work 
in the spring season of the year. This facility in feeding and 
supporting the small breed of horses, induces the small tenants 
and cottars, in some instances, to keep too many of them, and 
thereby greatly to injure their other and more valuable stocks. 
As to hogs and goats, of the former there are very few in the pa- 
rish ; and Lord Macdonald has, for many years past, prohibited 
the latter to be kept on his property, as they were considered by 
him highly injurious to wood plantations. The rivers, lakes, and 
sea coast all round the parish, abound with various kinds of fishes, 
and all of the most delicious and nutritive qualities. In the chan- 
nel which separates Rasay from the main body of the parish, and 
on all sides of the Island of Rasay, cod, ling, lythe, skate, had- 
docks, whitings, cuddies, flounders, and herrings abound. In the 
rivers and estuaries, there is salmon. Salmon does not go up the 
rivers in this parish, till late in the month of July ; and even then' 
they show every disposition to return in a short time, and before 
the channel of the rivers dries up. They seem also to anticipate 
a change from dry to rainy weather, as, a short time previous to 
rain, they are seen in numbers at the entries of rivers, and the 
moment rain comes on, and a sufficient depth of water to afford 
them a passage, they rush up with the greatest rapidity ; but at 
this period, salmon show a great discernment in perceiving the 



224 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



approach of dry weather, when they run back into the sea with 
equal care and dispatch. 

It appears to be the opinion of fishermen, that salmon do 
not remain in rivers, though they occasionally ascend till they 
begin to spawn in the latter end of the month of September. 
When they commence this operation, they continue at all hazards, 
disregarding every danger in deep pools of water in the rivers, 
till the work is completed in the month of December ; and then 
they are so much emaciated and enfeebled, that they are per- 
ceived to move slowly and with much difficulty in the water, and 
they never recover their condition till they return to the sea in the 
month of December, some sooner and some later. 

Botany. — There are in this parish some herbs that are bene- 
ficially employed in curing diseases, such as burdock, tussilago, 
 Films ante patrem . This last is usefully employed in cases of 
cough, asthma, and consumption. 

In the Island of Rasay, as well as about the village of Portree, 
there are small plantations of wood in a very thriving condition ; 
indeed, more rapid growth cannot be seen in any part of the low 
country of Scotland. The plantations consist of Scotch fir, larch, 
birch, ash, oak, alder, and some others. Larch is the kind most 
suitable to the soil, as it appears to thrive better than any of the 
other kinds of wood. 

The greater part of these plantations are only a few years old, 
and therefore the trees cannot be of any great size. At Rasay, 
however, and near the mansion-house, there are old trees of con- 
siderable size, such as are seen in the vicinity of towns, castles, 
and in forests, either in the Highlands, or in the low country of 
Scotland, And it appears to be a matter which admits of no 
doubt, that, in a place such as this parish, where there are so 
many localities favourable to the growth of timber, no improve- 
ment whatever could be more profitable, or of greater advantage 
both to proprietors and tenants, than the planting of wood. This, 
however, under existing circumstances, is a matter more to be 
wished for than expected. 

11. — CivfL History. 

Land-owners. — The Right Honourable Lord Macdonald and 

Macleod of Rasay, are the only land-owners in the parish. 

Parochial Register — A parish register of births and marriages 

was commenced in the year 1800, but discontinued six years 

3  



ISLAND OF SKYE — -POIITUEE. 



225 



thereafter. It was resumed five years from that date. From a va- 
riety of causes which could not be prevented, it has hitherto 
been irregularly kept. 

Mansion-House. — In Rasay, there is a very splendid modern 
house, of the most elegant architecture, — built by the late proprie- 
tor. The front of the house has a very superb appearance, and 
is constructed of freestone found in the place. There is also a 
large and commodious church in the village of Portree, which 
was erected about sixteen years ago, and is now in excellent repair. 

III. — Population. 

In the absence of all written record, our information regarding 
the ancient state of the population must be limited, and depend 
on vague and uncertain tradition. From this source, however, it 
appears that the people were very thinly spread over the whole ex- 
tent of the parish ; and though they lived in a rude, and almost 
savage state, they seldom suffered under the pressure of famine or 
destitution. Situate in localities remote from one another, each 
family had a sufficient extent of land to support a number of sheep 
and cattle. At the period to which we allude, the parish abounded 
with game of all sorts. In the rivers and estuaries, there was sal- 
mon in abundance ; and, being free from the restraints of the 
present game laws, the people may be said to have had a sufficiency 
of flesh, fish, milk, and venison. They cultivated small portions 
of the best part of the land, which yielded them some meal. It 
is, therefore, certain, that in old times, the people were more 
abundantly supplied with the necessaries and comforts of life than 
they are at present. 

In the year 1811 the amount of population was 2729 
1821 - - 3174 

1831 - - 3441 

By an enumeration since taken, - 4000 

This number is diminished by from 500 to 600 souls, who 
emigrated to North America in the course of this and last sum- 
mer. The immense increase that has taken place in the number 
of the people, may be ascribed to the introduction of vaccine ino- 
culation — the subdivision of lands among the crofter-tenants, 
by which two or three families occupy one lot, and sometimes one 
house. 

Character of the People. — They are powerfully under the influ- 
ence of moral principle, so much so, indeed, that heinous crimes 
are seldom or ever seen or heard of among them. They are attach- 



'2 on 

" INVKRNESS-SHlllE. 

ed to their superiors— obedient to tlie laws— dutiful and loyal to 
their sovereign— charitable to the poor, and hospitable to strangers. 
1 hey are all of the Established Church of Scotland, and firmly 
attached to her constitution, worship, and doctrine. So inviolable 
IS their attachment, that lately some of them, hearing of the dis- 
putes which at this moment unfortunately disturb and agitate our 
venerable Church, and dreading that these arose from the ascen- 
dency and hostility of Roman Catholic or other sectarians, were 
heard solemnly to declare in presence of the writer of these pages, 
that sooner than the church of their fathers should suffer violence 
or change, and far less annihilation, they would suffer their heads 
to be cut off. But with all their admirable mental qualifications, 
they labour under the greatest poverty, which never fails to carry 
along with it many disadvantages and many evils. And certainly, the 
want of cleanliness is not the least of "these. From the great 
scarcity of timber, there being none fit for use growing in the 
place, and the utter inability of the people to purchase and import 
wood, they are much at a loss for the necessary accommodations 
in regard to dwelling and other houses. 

The poor tenants are almost invariably under the necessity of 
having their cattle under the same roof with themselves without 
partition, without division, and without a chimney ; their houses, 
therefore, are smoky and filthy in the extreme; and, having little 
either of m'ght or day clothing, and their children nearly approach- 
ing to absolute nakedness, they are fully as much without cleanli- 
ness in their persons as they are in their houses. No people on 
earth live on more simple or scanty diet, than those in this parish. 
The greater number of them subsist on potatoes of the worst 
kind, sometimes with, but oftener without fish. 

The language generally spoken in the parish is Gaelic. From 
the facility of intercourse with the low country, by means of steam- 
navigation and Parliamentary roads, the people have acquired a 
taste for the English language, and are desirous to learn it. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agi-iculture. — A complete survey of the whole parish has never 
been made", and consequently the number of imperial standard 
acres in cultivation cannot with accuracy be ascertained ; indeed 
the extent of arable land, compared to that of pasture or moorland, 
•is so very inconsiderable, that it appears a matter of little or no 
importance whether it be ascertained with mathematical precision. 



ISLAND OF SKYE PORTllKE. 



227 



And scarce, very scarce, indeed, as arable land is, no speculation 
whatever could be more precarious and less profitable than the 
conversion of either moor or pasture into arable land. The ex- 
pense attending such an operation would far exceed any advantage 
that could reasonably be expected from such a process. The soil, 
naturally barren and unproductive, is everywhere interspersed with 
springs and spouts of water, and to drain it to any extent would be 
an endless work. Even where draining was resorted to in a pretty 
regular and systematic manner, and when the land was allowed to 
remain for any length of time out of culture, it would, in the course 
of a few years, revert to its original raw, sour, and unproductive 
state, and all the expense incurred would be irredeemably lost ; 
and being kept in cultivation, the produce would fall far short of 
compensation for the time, trouble, and expense necessarily and 
unavoidably employed. The small patches of land cultivated by 
the cottar-tenants, though they are at some pains to improve them, 
often yield no more than two returns. Even on the supposition 
that a person would succeed, with much expense and labour, upon 
an improved system, to improve the lands in this parish, by drains, 
enclosures, and all other plans successfully pursued in the south 
country for bringing it into cultivation, — after all this, he would ul- 
timately, be disappointed by the climate. It is very rare, indeed, 
that in this parish there is a favourable seed-time, and in harvest, 
heavy rains and strong gales of wind prevail, by which the corn 
crops are either lodged or shaken, and thus all the hopes of the 
husbandman are in a great measure frustrated. Top-dressing, 
which in other quarters is found a profitable improvement either 
for pasture or natural hay, would not pay on the sterile soil of the 
parish of Portree. As neither the lands nor the climate in this 
parish are suitable for agricultural purposes, so neither is the pas- 
ture land under the best arrangement. There is a great extent 
of hill grazing which is occupied as a common, not only by the 
small tenants to whose farms that common is attached, and by 
whom rent is paid for it, but also by cattle-dealers, and likewise 
by persons from every part of the island indiscriminately, who send 
cattle and horses to graze there in the summer months. This 
mode of tenure is productive of many disadvantages and evils ; it 
occasions disputes and quarrels among the immediate neighbours 
in possession ; it excites in their minds envy, anger, and even ma- 
lice one to another. It is highly injurious to the interest of the 



228 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



tenants, and equally prejudicial to that of the landlord ; it encou- 
rages and protects sheep-stealing ; and it is troublesome in the ex- 
treme to the neighbours in its immediate vicinity. The difficul- 
ties which occur in other parts of the country for dividing a com- 
mon m which different proprietors have an interest, some more 
and some less, and which require the interposition of the Supreme 
Court for allocating to each his due proportion, are not applicable 
to that here alluded to. It is altogether the property of one land- 
lord, and he might at once attach it to any farm he chose, or as 
best suited his interest. And, notwithstanding the facility for divid- 
ing this common, and the many disadvantages and evils resulting 
from its undivided state, it has been continued undivided from one ge- 
neration to another, from time immemorial, till this very moment 
Wood. — In this parish there is no natural wood growing, with 
the exception of a small quantity in the Island of Rasay, and even 
this was almost annihilated in the years 1836 and 1837; those 
years of memorable destitution, when the people, from the wet 
ness of the season, were unable to secure their peats, and the wood 
was made use of as fuel. There is, however, a little still re- 
maining, which is of no other use than for building small houses 
for the poor people. 

There is a considerable extent in Rasay of planted wood, 
and about'a third of that extent around the village of Portree. 

The trees are, fir, ash, oak, birch, mountain-ash ; they are 
under good management as to thinning, pruning, and they ap- 
pear to be in a thriving state. Indeed, from all that can be seen, 
a more profitable improvement of land in this parish cannot be 
adopted than planting wood in certain favourable situations. 

Eent. — The arable and pasture lands are let together ; the rent 
of the former, therefore, per acre, cannot be ascertained. For 
every sheep clipped, whether young or old, the grazier pays at the 
rate of 4s. each per annum ; and for every cow L. 2 Sterling; in 
both cases the expense of management is included. 

Wages. — The rate of payment to men-servants employed in 
agricultural pursuits is from L, 5 to L. 10 Sterling per annum, 
and to female-servants from L. 3 to L. 4 Sterling for the same 
period, together with bed, board, and washing. A mason and 
house-carpenter receive at the rate of from 2s. fid. to 3s. per day. 
But there is so little mechanical work carried on in the parish, 
that persons bred to these occupations are often, and for a great

part of the year, without employment, so that a tradesman is not 
at the end of the year in possession of more comfort, or in better 
circumstances, than a common labourer. 

Live- Stock. — The greatest attention is now paid to the improve- 
mentof both cattle and sheep, and the labours of the great Highland 
and Agricultural Society in Scotland, together with the local 
associations formed, after the constitution of that society, and adopt- 
ing its plans, are most instrumental in accomplishing this desirable 
purpose. The prizes annually awarded by those to meritorious and 
successful rearers, — the easy intercourseby means of Parliamentary 
and district roads, together with the facility of communication by 
steam navigation with other parts of the country, where both skill 
and capital are employed in the rearing and improvement of live- 
stock, — contribute their share in this parish to produce the same 
beneficial effect. 

Husbandry. — The kind of husbandry prevalent in this parish, is 
performed with the crooked spade ; an instrument most awkward 
in appearance and operation, but none is better fitted for the land. 
For here, the land is for the most part hanging on steep braes 
and precipices, and encumbered with rocks and ponderous stones. 
In these circumstances, it is evident that the plough could never be 
employed, and the straight spade, which is made use of in other 
parts of the Highlands, is far more fatiguing to the workman, and, 
with the same exertion, would not perform half the work in the 
same period of time. But the most painful of all the operations 
is the finishing part. After the ground is turned up with the 
crooked spade, and the seed sown, a male, or more frequently a 
female, takes a kind of hand-harrow, and with this the person 
works with both hands backward and forward, up and down, till 
the whole surface is made quite smooth, and all the hollows ren- 
dered completely level : or otherwise,- a person gets a small har- 
row made of light wood, to which he fixes a rope, which he takes 
in his hand, and over his shoulder or round his breast, and, by 
dragging it after him, he harrows and finishes his land. This 
mode of working is peculiar to those who have small divisions of 
land, and cannot keep horses; but these are by far the greater 
number. It is quite obvious that such tenants as these can never 
improve land. On the contrary, they are constantly in arrears 
to the proprietors, and frequently to the amount of two and some- 
times three years rent. The poverty of the people is an insur- 



230 



INVEHNRSS-SHIRE. 



mountable obstacle in the way of any rural improvement. To per- 
sons in such low circumstances a lease would be of no aclvantafe, 
and as little would the proprietors be disposed to grant them one. 
In the whole parish, there is only one farm held on lease. 

Fisheries, — There is a kind of stake salmon-fishing in the pa- 
rish. The tenant is a south countryman, in company with some 
others. They hold the whole fishing on Lord Macdonald's pro- 
perty. The fish is cured in the village of Portree, and is sent off 
by steam for Glasgow, and sometimes thence for London. They 
pay a certain small rent for the whole fishing of five parishes. One 
of those stations is relinquished, as not paying the expense. The 
station in this parish is the next to that in point of success, and con- 
sequently cannot be productive to any profitable extent. There 
is no separate rent exigible for the fishing of it. The herring 
fishing, some years ago, was carried on here with considerable suc- 
cess. In a fine evening in the month of July or August, when all 
the boats belonging to this parish, together with those belonging 
to the adjacent parishes of Glenelg, Lochalsh, Lochcarron, Ap- 
plecross, Gairloch, and Lochbroom, and with them boats belong- 
ing to vessels from fifty to seventy sails in number, appeared in the 
sound'of Rasay, — a most delightful scene was exhibited. But the 
most agreeable and the most useful of all exhibitions was their 
return to the harbour next day, deeply laden with the rich- 
est and most delicious herrings. It is a matter deeply to be re- 
gretted, that the herring fishing in this quarter has been much 
on the decline for several years past, so much so, that failure in 
this branch of industry, together with other causes operating in- 
juriously, produced the ever-memorable destitution of the years 
1836 and 1837. And were it not for the seasonable relief afford- 
ed by public contributions in every part of the British empire, 
both at home and abroad, the great body of the lower order of the 
community would have been swept off by the most appalling star- 
vation. Indeed, there is reason to fear that the herring-fishing 
will altogether disappear on the coast of this parish. This sta- 
tion was never so productive in herrings as were once Lochmad- 
dy in North Uist, Lochrog in Lewis, several arms of the sea in 
South Uist, and on the west side of the Isle of Skye ; and now in 
all these different localities, there is no fishing of any consequence. 
And why may not that happen also on the coast of this parish  
And should that unfortunately be the case, what will become

of its immensely redundant, population, already sunk in the low- 
est degradation of misery and poverty This is a matter high- 
ly deserving the most serious attention and consideration of all 
those having influence and power ; and it cannot fail to af- 
ford the highest satisfaction to every well-regulated mind, to. 
see the eff'orts now made by noblemen, proprietors, and others 
connected with the Highlands of Scotland, for transferring the 
poor and labouring classes of the community in these districts to 
the British colonies in North America, and more especially to Ca- 
nada. This appears to be the most eligible resort to the poor 
expatriated Highlander, in order to escape from his misery, to ac- 
quire comfort and independence, and where he will find employ- 
ment congenial to his habits and pursuits at home. The highest 
praise is due to Lord Macdonald for his liberality in this beneficent 
and patriotic enterprise, — he having this and last year expended 
large sums of money in conveying the poor people on his proper- 
ty tenants or not tenants to North America. And it is a matter 
devoutly to be wished, that other landed proprietors would follow 
his beneficent example, aswell as the Legislatureofthecountry, and 
thus provide comfortably for a noble race of men, — strengthen the 
hands of the local government in the American colonies, — and for 
ever put an end to disaff'ection to the state in that quax'ter. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — The village of Portree is the only place in the pa- 
rish in which markets are held for the sale of black-cattle. The 
population is nearly 300, including those in its immediate vicinity. 

There are several shop-keepers in the place who import meal 
and other commodities for the use of the country people. To the 
village of Portree there is a steam-boat plying from Glasgow once 
a-week, with a short cessation in the winter season. An excel- 
lent road has been constructed from one extremity of the parish 
to another, under the direction of the Parliamentary Commission- 
ers for building bridges and making roads in the Highlands and 
Islands of Scotland. This road is kept in repair by an assessment 
on the heritors of the county of Inverness. 

In the village there is a post-office, to which there is a post 
three times a week. 

Than the harbour of Portree there can hardly be a better. It is 
spacious enough to contain several hundred sail. It is shelter- 
ed on all sides, and from every wind that blows. From the very 



232 



INVERNESS-SniRE. 



liigh lands with which it is surrounded, the entry can very easily 
be found in the darkest night. The holding ground is of deep 
clay, and so firm and strong that it is very seldom, indeed, that a 
vessel is driven ashore, — and even should that unfortunately hap- 
pen, if she escapes from two or three rocky points, she will only 
be cast on a clayey or sandy bank. It is a good outlet for any 
quarter of the globe. At the entry, there is a breakwater formed 
by the hand of nature, which makes it narrow, but, at the same 
time, the water is very deep and the rock perpendicular at the 
edge. There are other harbours in the parish, but none to be 
compared to that of Portree. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the vil- 
lage of Portree, at a distance of about two miles from the northern, 
and fifteen from the southern extremity of the parish, and conse- 
quently not only not convenient, but altogether inaccessible to the 
great body of the people. It was built about sixteen years ago, 
and is in an excellent state of repair. It will accommodate about 
800 sitters, and no payment is exacted from any of them. 

The manse was built about thirty years ago, and, as soon as any 
thing is wanted in the way of repair, it is immediately supplied by 
the liberal heritors of the parish, oh the application of the incum- 
bent. • The glebe is sufficiently extensive, and, for the most part, 
consists of moss and hill pasture. It is, however, very susceptible 
of improvement. In its present state, it is worth L.20 Sterling 
per annum. In the course of a few years,"and in the possession 
of a person able and willing to improve, it may be made doubly 
valuable. The amount of stipend is the minimum, — L.150 Ster- 
ling, payable partly by the heritors, and partly by the Govern- 
ment. There is no Government church, but there is a missionary 
minister in the parish, on the establishment of the Committee of 
the General Assembly for promoting the knowledge of Christianity 
in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. His salary is paid by 
the Committee from the bounty annually allowed by the Crown 
for the reformation of the Highlands and Islands. 

There are no sectarians of any description in the parish. • 

The attendance at the different preaching stations in the pa- 
rish is from 300 to 400 souls, but frequently less in bad weather, 
when the people have a great distance to travel. The number of 
communicants in the parish, of late years, has greatly diminished, 
from a kind of delusion among the people. They seem now, how- 



ISLAND OF SKYE POIITKEE. 



233 



ever, to come to a better understanding, and, from present appear- 
ances, there is reason to believe that the number of communicants 
will soon be considerably increased. 

Ediicntion. — In this parish, there are two parochial schools, one 
by a society in Glasgow, and two Gaelic schools. In the paro- 
chial school situated in the village, English reading, writing, 
English grammar, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, Latin, 
and the elements of Greek, &amp;c. are taught. In the branch paro- 
chial school in Rasay, the elementary branches are only taught, 
and the same is the case in the Glasgow Society school. The pa- 
rochial teachers have all the accommodations to which they are by 
law entitled. The parochial school salary is the maximum, but 
the school-fees are only nominal. The people are so poor that they 
can scarcely afTord to pay any fees : and if the teacher insists on his 
right to receive fees from the scholars, their parents threaten to 
withdraw, and, in some instances, do actually withdraw their children 
from the school. As to the expense of education in these schools 
there are no pupils in attendance from distant quarters. It is only 
the children in the immediate vicinity of the school that attend, 
and all the charges to which they are liable are the small sums ex- 
pended in buying books, and the tritie of school-fees which they 
occasionally pay. This is an expense to which they with reluc- 
tance subject themselves, as they are not by any means so desirous as 
could be wished to have their children educated. The blessing of 
education having been for the most part denied themselves, by 
their predecessors, they are not particularly anxious to bestow it on 
their successors. 

There are two districts in this parish so remote, that they are 
inaccessible to the parochial and all other schools. These are the 
districts of Glenmore and the Braes. In the former of these 
places, 50 scholars might attend a school, and in the latter, from 
60 to 100, under a well-educated and systematic teacher. In 
both these localities, a subscription school has been taught 
occasionally, but the teachers were invariably so little qua- 
lified to discharge the duties of their office, and the remuneration 
for their labours so very inadequate, that little progress has hitherto 
been made in promoting the important object of education, and, 
consequently, many Instances of gross immorality occur among the 
people. At the same time, it is a matter of common observation, 
that profane swearing, intemperance, drunkenness, and the dese-

cration of the Sabbath, are not so common as they were twenty 
or thirty years ago. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of pooi- receiving 
aid is 89, and they receive from 2s. to 15s. each, and that only 
once a-year. The fund in aid of the poor arises from the in- 
terest of money, from the collection in the church, from occa- 
sional gratuities and benefactions by individuals, and from small 
sums exacted as fines from delinquents. The number of the poor 
hasbeenonthe increase annually, for some years past. They are sup- 
ported not so much from parochial funds or contributions, as they 
are by the charity and benevolence of their neighbours. The 
poorest of the people go about in the parish, and tliey are fed, 
and, in some instances clad, by the liberality of the inhabitants. It 
is only the most dire necessity that could ever induce the people 
to submit to the degradation of public begging; and nothing is so 
repugnant to their minds as to have their names inserted in the 
poor-list of the parish. 

Prisons. — There is one jail in the parish, and it has been occu- 
pied for the last year by sixteen offenders, eleven for riotous con- 
duct, four for housebreaking and theft, and one for forgery. The 
jail has been most insecure for some time past, and this has been 
fully evinced by the circumstance, that some prisoners have broken 
through it and made their escape. And certainly it is no matter 
of surprise, that every possible effort should be made by them for 
that purpose, when the bad treatment to which they are subjected 
is taken into consideration. Into the jail they are thrown without 
bed, without bedding, without fire, and with but a small allowance 
for their subsistence. By the humanity, however, and charity of 
some benevolent persons in the neighbourhood, these privations have 
been partly alleviated, if not removed. The jail has a keeper, who 
lias a certain small allowance made to him annually for his trouble 
by the county of Inverness. And the general superintendence is 
committed to the sheriff-substitute of the district of Skye, who 
holds his courts in the court room of the jail. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held in the parish, one in the 
month of May, one in the month of July, and one in the month of 
November. The two former for the sale of black-cattle, and the 
latter for hiring servants, and for transacting other country busi- 
ness. 

Inns. — For the accommodation of persons who attend these 



ISLAND OF SKYE — PORTREE. 



235 



fairs, as well as travellers and others, there is an excellent public- 
house in the village of Portree. There is another public-house 
in the district of Sconcer. Both these inns are kept by very re- 
spectable individuals, and, in so far as the writer has been able to 
learn, they have no perpicious effects on public morals. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used in this parish is peat. Every family 
may cut as much out of a peat bank as will serve them throughout 
the year. This they do in the commencement of the dry weather, in 
the months of April or May. And, as this operation is performed 
by the people at a time when they would otherwise be idle, it may 
be said to cost them no money. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

On the surface of the parish, the greatest change has been 
produced by the Parliamentary and other district roads throughout 
the parish. In the architectural department, some very important 
variations have taken place. Since the date of the old Statistical Ac- 
count the elegant house of Rasay, the house occupied by Lord Mac- 
donald's chamberlain at Portree, thebank-housebuiltby theNational 
Bank of Scotland, the jail, and several other houses erected in the 
village by Lord Macdonald and other individuals, together with 
the church and manse, are all constructed. 

The parish is rather a pastoral than an agricultural district. 
To produce the greatest advantage, therefore, to proprietor and te- 
nants, it should be cut into sizable farms, with distinct boundaries 
to each, and of sufficient extent to support a family. 

These farms should be let on leases of from fifteen to twenty years 
endurance, and given to persons who have a sufficient capital to 
stock, and skill to manage them. But with the present immense 
population, in a place without commerce, without manufactures, 
without agriculture, and without any kind of permanent employ- 
ment for the people, no system that can be adopted will render 
them comfortable. 

To accommodate the people, the proprietors have tried many 
experiments. Previous to the year 1811, almost all the farms on 
Lord Macdonald's property in this parish were held in common, 
or, as it is termed, on runrig. About that period, finding that 
the people were rapidly increasing in number, and a great demand 
among them for land, with few exceptions, all the farms in pos- 
session of small tenants were cut into lots or crofts, and each of 
these was let to a family. In the course of a few years, a tenant 



23j 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



on a lot had a son, who, in opposition to every advice that could 
be given him, by parents, relatives, and friends, would, whether 
right or wrong, be married. To provide for this son, his wife, and 
his family, there was no other alternative than to give him a 
share gf the lot. The same individual letter has a daughter, to 
whom some young man becomes attached ; marriage is proposed 
and agreed upon ; but in the matrimonial contract, it is express- 
ly stipulated, that this new ally of the family shall have an esta- 
blishment on the lot. 

Thus on one portion of land, too small for the support of the 
original, there are now three families. It is easily seen that the si- 
tuation of these must be poor in the extreme. The proprietors 
show every kindness and indulgence. Their rents are not rigidly 
exacted at a term. There are instances of tenants being allowed to 
remain in arrear, some two, some three, and some even four 
years. 

It is, however, perfectly evident that no liberality on the part 
of proprietors can render the present immense surplus population 
in any measure comfortable. And there is, humanly speaking, no 
other way to provide for them than by emigration ; though cer- 
tainly, it would be for ever a matter of deep regret, that so noble 
a race of men should be under the necessity of leaving their native 
land and seeking an asylum on a foreign shore. But, as they are 
unable to effect this by any means within their own reach, they 
should be conveyed to any British settlement which may be thought 
eligible — all the expense defrayed, and lands provided for them 
in their adopted settlement, by the Government of the country.

THE REV. ROBERT MACGREGOR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Kilmuir is the most northern parish in the island of 
Skye. The name signifies the " Church of Mary," and is de- 
rived from the Gaehc words Cill, a chapel, or burying-ground, 
and Muire, Mary. The parish of old was frequently desig- 
nated St Mary's, as may be seen in Martin's History of the 
Isles, and in other ancient documents. Although the whole 
civil parish is now comprehended under the name Kilmuir, yet in 
former times only a small district of it went under that denomina- 
tion, viz. that in which the parish church was formerly built. The 
parish originally consisted of a variety of Cills which were dedi- 
cated to their respective tutelary saints, such as Kileana, Kilmar- 
tin, Kilmorie, Kildorais, Kilmaluag, Kilvaxter, Kilbride, &amp;c. to 
each of which was attached a portion or district of the parish. 

Boundaries. — Kilmuir being a section of the northern end of 
Skye, is bounded for the most part by sea, viz. on the north, by 
the channel which intervenes between Skye and the islands of 
Lewis and Harris, commonly called the Minsh ; on the east by the 
sound of Gairloch ; on the south, by the parish of Snizort ; and 
on the west, ]artly by the Minsh, and partly by Loch Snizort. 
The dimensions of the parish vary considerably, and its almost 
semicircular form is rendered very irregular by a variety of small 
indentations and promontories. The extreme points of it may be 
distant in a straight line about 16 English miles ; its breadth, taken 
at right angles, varies from 6 to 10 miles; and it is supposed to 
contain about 50 square miles. The centre of the parish is in la- 
titude 57° 34' north, and in longitude 6° 15' west.

Topographical Appearances. — Kilrauir is in a manner bisected by 
the extremity of a range of hills, which passes through it and the ad- 
jacent parishes of Snizortand Portree. The highest may be com- 
puted to be about 1200 feet above the level of the sea. There is a 
variety of small hills, which are principally green, forming in some 
parts little glens through which small rivulets run to the sea; in other 
parts, they cause the formation of little lakes, of which there are many 
in the parish. These little hills are, also, in some places totally di- 
vided from the rest of the mountains, and, from their isolated and 
conical appearance, there are to be found here ahd there truly pictu- 
resque scenes. There is one hill in particular, to the top of which 
the access is easy by a gentle acclivity, while it is found abruptly 
to terminate in a huge perpendicular precipice about 600 feet high, 
overhanging a dark circular lake of great depth. This rock affords 
a secure nestling-place to eagles and other birds of prey. 

One scene in this parish — that of Quiraing — must be particu- 
larly noticed. This remarkable formation of nature consists of a 
secluded piece of level and fertile ground, which is concealed in 
the face of an almost inaccessible precipice. The hill in which it 
is situated, is about 1000 feet in height, and slopes by a steep de- 
clivity towards the west ; but towards the north-east, it presents a 
face of rugged precipices, much variegated by being here and 
there composed of huge basaltic columns, or massy fragments of 
fluted rocks. In other parts, large spaces, formed into concave 
sections, present themselves to the view, and have a majestic ap- 
pearance, from being ribbed transversely either by small fissures, 
or protuberant seams, over which a little rivulet drizzles in moist 
seasons of the year. In the face of this huge precipice, then, 
Quiraing is enshrined, and entirely hidden from the view of the 
visitor. This interesting spot consists of a green plot of ground, 
formed into an oblong platform of sufficient extent to contain six 
or seven regiments of soldiers. It is studded all round with mas- 
sive columns of rock, rising up in lofty peaks, by the intervention 
of deep chasms, which are for the most part inaccessible. On ap- 
proaching the great inlet to the eagerly looked-for platform, the 
passage is much obtruded by heaps of stone and rubbish, which 
have been washed down from the crevices by the gradual waste of 
successive ages. When these obstacles are overcome, the visitor 
finds himself at the entrance of a steep passage, which would seem 
to lead to the top of the hill. To the right of this entrance 



ISLAND OF SKYE — KILMUIR,

stands an isolated pyramid of rock, called the Needle. By 
considerable exertion the tourist gains the top of the pass, and be- 
holds with indescribable wonder the scene which opens to his 
view  Instead of seeing, as he would expect, some narrow cave, 
he beholds a spacious opening before him, in the centre of which 
stands the above-mentioned platform. By descending a short dis- 
tance, and threading his way by a small path, he is instantly led 
to the beautiful green plain which it was all along his object to at- 
tain. He now feels utterly bewildered, and quite at a loss what 
to examine first, or to admire most  He beholds the rocks frown- 
ing aloft, and the rugged cliffs ranging themselves in circles around 
him. Rocky pyramids, like a bulwark, encompass the fairy plain 
on which he stands. All is felt to be a dreary solitude ; yet there 
is a pleasing beauty in the silent repose. The golden eagle is 
seen soaring aloft in the blue firmament. A panoramic view of 
the distant sea and district below is visible, only in detached frag- 
ments, through the rugged clefts and chasms between the sur- 
rounding pyramids. The rocks which compose these huge co- 
lumns are so streaked and variegated, that the visitor's imagination 
cannot fail to delineate hundreds of grotesque figures, of the wildest 
description, on their surface. The nature of the day on which this 
interesting place is visited has a great effect upon its appearance. It 
is so studded and encompassed with columns and pinnacles, of all 
heights, sizes, and figures, that their flickering shadows, on a sun- 
shine day, have an enchanting effect on all who behold them  
Light and shade are then so uncommonly divided, and so con- 
stantly changing positions, that the place, in consequence, is 
greatly enhanced in beauty. But should a dense mist envelope 
the spot, as is frequently the case, the scene is greatly changed. 
Instead of being lively and enchanting, a night-like gloom falls 
over it, like a shroud of darkness  The thick mist slowly floating 
through the pyramids, and concealing their rugged pinnacles from 
the view, gives a sombre appearance to the whole  The visitor's 
imagination will lead him to think that the gloomy pyramids be- 
fore him bind earth and Heaven together  He cannot but ad- 
mire ; yet, at the same time, he is filled with a sort of awe, which 
causes him to ascribe the marvellous works which lie shrouded be- 
fore him, to the wonderful doings of that Omnipotent Being who 
created all things  

The cultivated part of the parish is a kind of circular belt along 
its shores, about two miles of average breadth. It is naturally di-

vided into three districts, that of Kihuuir, of Kilmaluag, and of 
Steinscholl or East-side. The surface of each of these districts 
IS almost wiiolly seen at one view from either extremity. The 
coast is hold, high, and rocky. Its extent, owing to the vast num- 
ber of small bays and headlands, is supposed to be no less than 
forty miles. In many places, the land is hemmed in by tracks of 
lofty and perpendicular precipices, most regularly formed into 
large parallel, square, round, and triangular pillars of basalt. 
There are varieties of small caves to be found concealed among 
these columns, In one place, there is a little spar-cave; and in 
another, there is one known by the name of Udmh an dir, — 
" the cave of the gold," respecting which several traditions are 
afloat among the natives. None of these caves, however, is pos- 
sessed of peculiarities worthy of any lengthened observations. 

Headlands. — The principal headlands are, Rutha-chuirn-leith, 
Rutha Bhorniskittaig, Rutha-hunish, Rutha-bheannachain, Rutha- 
ghara-fada, and Rutha-nam-braithrean. The principal bays or 
lochs are those of Cammusmore, Duntulm, Kilmaluag, and Al- 
tivaig or Staffin, none of which afford a safe anchorage, with the 
exception of Duntulm. 

Islands. — The principal islands are, lasgairor Yesker, Fladda- 
chuain, Tulm, Trodda, Altivaig, and Fladda. Of these Trodda 
is the most extensive and valuable. With the exception of Flad- 
da-chuain, the second largest of the group, none of them possess 
any remarkable peculiarities. They are all uninhabited, being 
merely rented for grazing by tacksmen, who look upon them as 
useful appendages to their farms. Fladda-chuain is about six 
miles from the nearest part of Skye, and is about three-fourths of 
a mile in length, and three hundred yards in average breadth. 
The quality of its grass is remarkably fine, and perhaps superior 
to any in the parish for pasturing a few sheep. It is surrounded 
by four lesser islands, which are capable of rearing only two or 
three sheep a piece. It is a remarkable fact, that in this little 
island, which is so far from any other land, and situated in the 
midst of a very salt, deep, and rapid channel, there are two or 
three fresh water springs. In former ages, it was inhabited by a 
family or two, who had a considerable portion of it under cultiva- 
tion. Although so remote and distant from the shore, it was an- 
ciently the site of a Druidical place of worship, which will be af- 
terwards mentioned. It is a curious phenomenon, well worthy 
the attention of the naturalist, that such animals as the toad, 



ISLAND OF SKYE— KILMUIR. 



241 



frog, mouse, rat, snail, &amp;c. can have no existence in it, although 
all°the other islands of the parish abound with them. It is credi- 
tably reported, that mice have been carefully carried thither several 
times for experiment, but upon landing them that they instantly died.. 

Names of Hamlets, -c— In this and in most other parishes of 
the Hebrides the names of hamlets, hills, bays, promontories, &amp;c. 
are evidently, for the most part, of Scandinavian origin.  In some 
cases, however, Gaelic roots with Scandinavian terminations, and 
vice versa, are to be met with. It is a remarkable fact, that the 
names given to certain localities by the natives of a foreign land, 
have been retained for so many ages and generations, as is the 
case here and elsewhere. When the prevalence of Scandinavian 
names is taken into consideration, and the great disproportion 
which they bear to those of Celtic origin, it will appear evident, 
that the number, power, and influence of the aboriginal popu- 
lation was but small in comparison with that of the Norwe- 
gian invaders. Most promontories end with the termination 
" nish," which must be the same with the French " nez," the 
Latin " nasus," the English « nose," the Gaelic " innis," an 
island or promontory, all meaning the projecting feature. We 
have therefore Hunish, Vaternish, Skernish, &amp;c. In other parts 
of Scotland, such places have the termination " ness," as Strom- 
ness, Tarbetness, Buchanness, &amp;c. The barony of Troternish 
seems evidently to derive its name from Trodda, a small island 
which is situated near the northern point of it, and the termination 
" nish," — that is Trodda-wM, now pronounced Troternish, the 
point or territory of Trodda. A great variety of places terminate 
in " host," as Orbost, Libost, Skeabost, Carboht, &amp;c.; so do a 
number in " burg," as Resaburg, Scuddeburg, &amp;c. Many ham- 
lets end with " garry," as Flodigarry, Osmagarry, &amp;c. ; many 
with " latter," as Hunglatter, Seoglatter, &amp;c. ; many with " shad- 
der," as Elishadder, Marishadder, &amp;c. ; many with " sta" and 
" stadt," as Shulista, Dehsta, Herbusta, Monkstadt, Brunistadt, 
&amp;c. As has been already observed, many places derive their 
appellations from saints, such as the followers of St Columba, and 
others ; but these, although frequently much corrupted, are pure- 
ly of Celtic origin. It is most remarkable, that no trace or vo- 
cable of the Scandinavian language is found, in any shape, in the 
language of the country, except names of hamlets and other loca- 
lities. The language of the inhabitants is purely Celtic. 

Meteor olojy.— Ki the parish is so much encompassed by sea, 



242 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



the temperature of the atmosphere, although exceedingly variable, 
seldom descends very low. No meteorological tables have been 
kept \n the parish, whereby the changes of temperature and varia- 
tions of climate might be stated with accuracy ; yet, it may be as- 
serted, generally, that the climate is very moist, rainy, and bois- 
terous. The mercury in the thermometer seldom falls below 25, 
or rises with the exception, perhaps, of a few days in summer, 
above 76° of Fahrenheit. The barometer, however, indicates 
frequent and sudden changes in the pressure of the atmosphere. 
The mercury, which generally stands at or near 29|°, has often 
been observed to rise or fall more than half an inch in the course 
of a day. The cold of winter is less intense, and the heat of 
summer less oppressive than in most other parts of the kingdom. 
Torrents of rain fall in all seasons of the year, and the moisture 
which descends in the Highlands of Scotland, in the form of snow, 
descends here, for the most part, in sleet and rain. For many 
years back, snow seldom lay on the ground above a day or two ; 
whereas, in former periods, severe snow storms were prevalent, 
and generally of long duration. In this respect, the seasons, from 
some unknown cause, have undergone a sensible change. Ow- 
ing to the prevalence of dampness, and the moist nature of the 
atmosphere, it is no easy matter to preserve polished iron, steel, 
and other metals free from rust. Knives, fire-irons, and all such 
utensils of polished metallic surfaces must be frequently rubbed 
or brushed, otherwise they would rust in a single day, unless kept 
in places heated by constant fires. The frequent rains of the 
place can only be accounted for, from its vicinity and exposure to 
the Atlantic, the exhalations of which, appearing in dark clouds, 
are conveyed eastward by the westerly breeze, and are naturally 
attracted by the hills and mountains of the Hebrides in general. 
The most prevailing wind is the south-west ; and, from the cause 
already stated, it is generally attended with rain. This wind, by 
sweeping across the western ocean, is necessarily saturated with 
moisture ; and, while it passes from a warmer to a colder climate, 
naturally deposits its humidity on the first land which obstructs 
its course. From the effects of this wind the hopes of the hus- 
bandman are frequently blasted ; and if it happen to prevail in the 
ripening months of autumn, the fruits of his industry and labour 
are in danger of being destroyed. Wind from the opposite quar- 
ter, viz. north-east, though frequently cold, is for the most part 
dry.

There is scarcely any thunder except in winter and spring, when 
it is very prevalent. Lightning is to be seen at all seasons, and 
some of the oldest inhabitants prognosticate the weather with a 
wonderful degree of correctness, both from the colour of the elec- 
tric fluid, and the time of day when it appears. It is generally observ- 
ed, that when vivid flashes of lightning are seen early in the 
morning, the ensuing weather will be unfavourable ; but while seen 
towards the evening, better hopes are entertained. It is remark- 
ed also, that when the aurora borealis is seen ascending high into 
the heavens, and when some rays have a reddish appearance, and in- 
stantly vanish to give place to others of a darker hue, then the 
weather will certainly change, and continue to be unfavourable for 
a length of time. 

The forms and colouring of Nature are frequently magnificent- 
ly grand. Scenes at times present themselves which are both in- 
teresting and impressive. Who can behold without a pleasing 
elevation of mind, the tempestuous Atlantic battling with the fury 
of the elements What can be more beautiful than to witness 
the clouds of mist receding, in thickening folds, from the moun- 
tains, to the higher regions of the atmosphere, and leaving the 
landscape again to rejoice in the brightness of sunshine  At 
times, they present phenomena like celestial mountains tinged with 
the riches and variety of prismatic colouring  The splendour of 
the morning and evening drapery frequently baffles all descrip- 
tion. The aurora borealis, or polar lights, are often exceedingly 
brilliant ; as are likewise the solar rainbow, and the lunar halo. 
Such luminous meteors, certainly surpass in magnificence any ap- 
pearance of the kind in other parts of the kingdom. The natives 
prognosticate the weather in various ways. It may be noticed also, 
that they attribute much importance, not only here, but in most parts 
of the Highlands, to the phases of the moon, not solely in regard 
to the weather, but likewise to the season best fitted for performing 
many acts of labour. They imagine that an increasing moon com- 
municates a growing quality to most substances, while a decreas- 
ing moon has an opposite tendency, and causes such substances to 
decay or wither. Actuated by this supposition, they avoid, in ge- 
neral, slaughtering animals in the wane of the moon, as then, ac- 
cording to their idea, the meat will shrink and decrease while in 
process of cooking. On the other hand, they prefer cutting tim- 
ber, mowing hay, casting turf, and delving ground, between full 
and new moon, as they are under the belief, that by so doing, the 



1nv1':une.siS-sihrE. 



processes of seasoning will be accelerated, and that the sap, or na- 
tural juice, weeds, &amp;c. will more speedily decay. 

Diseases. — The diseases to which the inliabitants are most liable, 
and from which they sull'er most, are of an inflammatory kind, 
proceeding from their being continually exposed to damp and 
cold. During the spring and part of the winter, they are daily 
in the fields in all weathers, cultivating their patches of land ; 
consequently they are but seldom either dryly clad or shod. The 
complaints most prevalent are, acute rheumatism, pleuritic dis- 
orders, typhus fevers, pneumonia, asthma,' dyspepsia, erysipela- 
tous affections, and a diseased action of the lymphatic system. 
Small-pox, and other contagious diseases, at times make their ap- 
pearance, being generally brought to the parish by the labourers 
who frequent the towns and cities of the kingdom in quest of 
employment. Vaccination has been partially introduced, and the 
prejudice which the people had against it for a length of time, isgra- 
dually vanishing. There is no medical practitioner nearer than 
the village of Portree, upwards of twenty miles distant ; and the 
consequence is, that he is never sent for but in cases of extreme 
danger. Three or four individuals lately died at the age of 100. 
In the district of Steinscholl, a man died about twelve years ago, 
named John Nicolson, or MacCormaic, at the very advanced age 
of 105. There is one circumstance connected with this old man's 
history worthy of notice, which is, that he could repeat the mosfe 
of Ossian's Fingal, Temora, &amp;c. with great fluency and precision. 
The writer of this heard him say that he committed these beau- 
tiful poems to memory, from hearing them repeated, when a boy, 
by his grandfather. If this fact be not sufficient to establish the 
authenticity of these unparalleled poems, it must surely establish the 
truth, that they existed before thetime of Macpherson, whoattempt- 
ed to translate them into the English language. The silly allegation' 
by some, that Ossian's poems were Macpherson's own production, 
is palpably confuted by MacCormaic and others, who could repeat 
them before Macpherson was born. But should that not have 
been the case, and should none have been found who could re- 
hearse them before Macpherson's time, the allegation, that they 
were either by Macpherson, or by any other in the age in which 
he lived, appears ridiculous in the sight of such as know the con- 
struction and beauty of the Celtic language. 

Hydrography. — Kilmuir, as has been already stated, is bounded 
on the one side by the channel called the Minsh, and on the 



ISLAND OF SKYE KILMUIIJ. 



245 



other by the Gauloch Channel, each being about twenty miles 
in average breadth. The water of these channels is exceedingly 
salt. The currents, although regular, are very strong and rapid. 
The bottoai of these channels must be very rugged, as the depths, 
which are generally great, vary in almost every place. The pa- 
rish is supplied with numerous excellent perennial fresh water 
springs, some of which have a copious discharge. There are also 
a few of the chalybeate nature, but not very much impregnated. 
The temperature of these springs varies but httle at any season of 
the year, as they seem to issue immediately from a great depth. 

On the farm of SteinschoU, there is a spring which was disco- 
vered, only a few years ago, whose water is supposed by some to 
be similar to that of Strathpeffer ; but such is not the case, as it 
is saline, and exhibits no trace of sulphuretted hydrogen. Six 
ounces of this water were analyzed by a celebrated chemist in the 
south, who found them to contain, muriates of lime and potash, 
sulphates of soda, lime, and magnesia, carbonate of lime, and a 
trace of peroxide of iron and organic matter. 

At a certain place in the parish, there is an accidental conflux 
of pure fresh-water springs, which form a small eUiptical pond of 
considerable depth. The bottom consists of whitish sand, which, 
by being visible through the transparent water, gives a beautiful 
greenish tinge to the whole. This small lake is surrounded by a 
little brushwood, and the rivulet which flows from it into the sea 
is pleasantly hemmed and edged with a few shrubs and bushes. 
The pond was anciently called Loch Sianta or Seunta, which 
means the sacred lake, and it retains the name to this day. The 
hallowed appearance of the situation did not escape the fancy of 
the ancient Highlanders, whose veneration for such places was 
carried to a ridiculous excess. Owing to the crystalline purity 
of the water, its copiousness, and the sequestered situation of this 
little Hebridean Siloam, they conceived it to be favoured with its 
divinity, to whom, in the early ages of darkness and ignorance, they 
were extremely punctual in making offerings of various kinds. In- 
valids always resorted thither, and imagined that they were bene- 
fited by drinking of its water, and by thoroughly washing them- 
selves in a bath erected for the purpose. These superstitions 
have, however, long ago ceased, and Loch Sianta, though beauti- 
ful as ever, has lost its ancient charms in this more enlightened 
age. 

On the sea-shore, where the rivulet which issues from Loch 



24G 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



Sianta discharges itself into the deep, dilse, or Fuciis palmatus, 
of most superior quality is found, which is much prized by the 
natives, who frequently cook it like greens, and other vegetables, 
and reckon it a salutary dish. 

A little fresh water lake in the parish, called Loch Miaghailt, 
discharges its water by a subterraneous passage, through the rocks 
between it and the sea. Near where the stream from this loch 
spouts out from the precipice, may be seen the form of a High- 
lander, in full garb, in the face of the rock. From the striking 
resemblance of this cliff to a Highlander in complete costume, it 
received the name of Creaff nafeile, the rock of the kilt, and has 
been frequently admired by tourists in search of the picturesque. 
It can only be seen to advantage from a little distance at sea. 

Near the ancient house of Flodigarry, there is an eminence in 
close vicinity to the sea-shore, upon which, when a person stands, 
he hears under him a loud rumbling noise, which must be caused 
by the sea finding an entrance under the eminence, by means of 
some hollow recesses which are too deep to be seen. 

Not far from the house of Aird-mhic-ceolain, there is a remark- 
able natural formation called Slochd a' mhadaidh, where the sea 
dashes under a natural arch into a circular pool beyond it. From 
this pool there is a subterraneous passage of some hundred yards 
in length, through which a person may scramble, at low-water, 
and come out at the other end. At the place where the person comes 
out of that rough, dark passage, he sees before him a huge, iso- 
lated rock of considerable height, called Stachd-Lachlain. This 
rock is encompassed with quadrangular columns of basalt, and 
covered on the top with grass. As no one can scramble to its 
summit, marine fowls take possession of it for a nestling-place. 
In another place on the same farm, there is a variety of arches 
and passages, through which the sea dashes with a hollow rumbling 
noise. 

There are five little lakes in the parish, which abound with 
small black and yellow trout. The largest of the lakes was that 
of St Columba, which is now drained. It was proposed to drain 
this sheet of water as early as the year 1715, and the work was 
commenced under the superintendence of Sir Donald Macdonald, 
who, from his great achievements, was commonly called DonuU a' 
chogaidh, that is warlike Donald. The work was, however, re- 
linquished in an unfinished state, owing to the disturbances occa- 
sioned in this and other parts of the kingdom by the battle of 



ISLAND OF SKYE KILMUIR. 247 

Sheriffmuir. It is said that although the draining was not then 
thoroughly accomplished, yet it was so to such an extent, that a con- 
siderable quantity of water escaped. The proprietor set about 
redraining this loch about the year 1763, and succeeded ; but, from 
neglect in keeping the trenches in proper repair, it was allowed 
again to fill. The work was commenced anew in 1824, by the 
late Right Honourable Lord Macdonald, and after a period of 
five years, during which time a great number of labourers were 
employed, the lake was converted into arable land. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Some mineralogists who have visited 
this and the adjacent parishes, have justly pronounced them to be 
store-houses of geology, in which several of the more rare minerals 
have been found. 

The hills abound with moss, which is also met with in many 
parts of the low grounds. The remains of various kinds of wood 
are very prevalent in the black solid moss. Roots, bark, and 
branches are found in some parts in great quantities, while in other 
parts solid trunks of trees are met with, some of which are much 
decayed. In almost every peat-bog, quantities of hazel-nuts have 
been dug up, and even the leaves of that wood have been seen in 
a state of wonderful preservation. The soil in general is of a glu- 
tinous, clayey description, interspersed in low situations by tracks 
of alluvial earth. Even in places where the surface is a light dark 
mould, the subsoil, by digging some feet, is found to be a stiff al- 
luvial clay. In some parts the soil consists chiefly of decomposed 
trap-rock, and other substances, which have undergone changes, 
by the action of the elements. In the localities where the deep 
heavy clay predominates, the soil speedily hardens in dry weather 
to such a degree, that the operations of agriculture are with diffi- 
culty performed, while in wet weather it softens so much as to 
cause similar inconvenience. 

The general aspect of the shores is bold, wild, and rocky. The 
whole range from the south-east boundary of the parish to the bay 
of Altivaig, presents an uninterrupted front of columnar precipices 
of basalt. In some parts, the monotony of the scene is relieved 
by lofty, isolated cliffs, jutting forth in fantastic forms, while in 
others, horizontal walls, rising above each other in successive gra- 
dations, shoot across the perpendicular rocks. Natural arches, 
vertical chasms, and dark, gloomy caverns, are found in several 
localities. Some of the hills slope gradually on the one side from 
their summits to their bases, while on the other they suddenly 



28 



INVEUNESS-SIIIllE. 



present vertical fronts- of great height, with blocks and detached 
fragments strewed in piles below, which must have fallen down 
from the impending cliffs, by the waste of time. The hill in which 
Quiraing is situated, Creag-Nisdale, and a hill to the south of 
Duntulm, &amp;c. afford striliing instances of this. The trap rock 
more generally undergoes the process of decomposition, and on 
that account, where it is formed into lofty cliffs, the decomposed 
parts slope away from their bases to considerable distances. 

The stratified rocks exhibit, in several places, extensive ranges 
of natural masonry, over which the trap rises in the columnar form 
to considerable altitudes. While the more perishable rock is 
washed away, that which is more durable remains in the shape of 
isolated pillars of all sizes and altitudes. Such changes and de- 
compositions cause the formation of numberless pinnacles and 
conoidal points, which resemble at times the turrets or ornaments 
of artificial masonry. Detached columns are therefore frequent, 
and some of them rise to a great height over bases of small di- 
mensions. 

The stratified rocks in the parish are very irregular, and in many 
parts so greatly distorted and broken, that their dip, angle of in- 
clination, and other properties, can hardly be ascertained. 

Near the north boundary of the parish, the trap descends to 
the water's edge, and conceals entirely from view what may exist 
under it. A little to the south the strata reappear, but to a very 
small extent. Near the Castle of Duntulm, and southward, the 
shore presents thin beds of limestone, with shales of various co- 
lours, verging to flinty slate. Some specimens of carbonized 
wood are here found, sometimes in detached pieces, and sometimes 
imbedded in blocks of coarse sandstone. Under the lofty cliffs 
of the eastern boundary of the parish, fragments of coal, chert, 
and flinty slate are met with. 

At Borniskittag-point, west of the manse, there are three 
caves, one of which, called Uamh an oir, hash een said by many 
to resemble in miniature, Fingal's cave in Staffa. In the whole 
range of this highly interesting headland, facing the north, the 
shore, for nearly a mile, is hemmed with precipices, which have 
assumed the columnar disposition, and which display picturesque 
combinations of form. Near the point where the caves are, 
the columns, broken above and below, present square flat sur- 
faces. The parts of them which remain below, rise above each 



ISLAND OF SKYE — KILMUIR. 249 

Other in steps, as if hewn out of the solid rock by artificial means. 
These caves can only be entered at low -tide. 

Near the northern boundary of the parish, the continual dash- 
ing of the waves against the opposing rocks has hollowed out ho- 
rizontal chasms, which emit sounds like the report of cannon, when 
the sea is lashed into them by the violence of a northern gale. In 
a storm, the sounds occasioned by these dark recesses are so loud 
as to be heard at the distance of many miles, and, from their re- 
semblance to the peals of ordnance, the place is called, Na gun- 
naichean, or the guns. 

In a small cave near these recesses, there are concretions of 
stalactites, which appear on its roof in the form of cream-coloured 
icicles. At one time the water which dropped from the roof of this 
little cave formed a beautiful spar-basin below, which was about 
four feet in diameter ; but people, from curiosity, demolished it, in 
order to carry pieces of it away. 

In some parts, gneiss is the lowest rock, and in apparent connec- 
tion with it, sandstone, greywacke slate, and common slate. Fel- 
spar, quartz, and chlorite slate constitute another variety met 
with in some places — masses of hornblende and hornblende 
slate alternate in several parts with the prevailing rock, while 
in other places beds of chlorite slate are seen passing into blue 
argillaceous or talcaceous slate. Beautiful specimens have been 
found of white felspar traversed by slender veins of hornblende. 
There is no red-sandstone in the parish, with the exception of 
some detached blocks on the shores of the island of Fladda, 
which are supposed by some to have been conveyed thither from 
the opposite island of Rona, by the force of some stream or cur- 
rent. Others entertain the opinion, that red -sandstone and gneiss 
exist in beds under the sea in the vicinity of Fladda, and that the 
detached blocks just-mentioned have been thrown up from the bot- 
tom. 

Beds of common black shale make their appearance in two or 
three places, as also calcareous strata alternating with common 
shale. In many parts, the whole body of the rock seems to be one 
mass of petrified shells. The same when broken exhibits distinct 
impressions of bivalves of different sizes. The shores abound with 
stones of all sizes, which are so full of little cavities including shells, 
that when taken up and shaken, they make a rattling noise like a 
child's toy. 

It is quite impracticable in a work of this kind to mention and

describe the various unstratified rocks, or to give a minute account 
of their several changes and intricate combinations. Tliere is 
little or no granite in the parish, and mica-slate is but seldom met 
with. In some parts, the rocks are beautifully studded vpith the crys- 
tals of quartz. Several varieties of greenstones are found. Spe- 
cimens of asbestus and rock-crystal exist, but are rare. Porphyry, 
syenite, breccia, &amp;c. are seen in more or less abundance. 

Several minerals, which principally belong to the zeolite family, 
are found. Chabasite and analcime exist, although comparatively 
rare. Stilbite and steatite, on the other hand, are very abundant. 
The former is found in great quantities among the remains of the 
decomposed trap-stone. 

Petrifactions of shells, fishes, and sea-plants, have been frequent- 
ly met with, but the specimens found of animal remains were not 
sufficiently perfect to enable the mineralogist to determine to what 
class they belonged. 

Zoology. — A catalogue of most of, if not all, the feathered tribes, 
which frequent the parish and the channels by which it is encom- 
passed, is sent along with the MS., and, if required, will be found 
in retentis along with it. It embraces the six orders of the Aves 
mentioned by Linnaeus, under his second class of natural history, 
and these will be found in the above-mentioned catalogue, viz. 1. 
Accipitres ; 2. Picse ; 3. Anseres ; 4. Grallae ; 5. Gallinse ; and 6. 
Passeres. The cuckoo and other migratory birds pay their annual 
visits at their periodical seasons. The cuckoo's egg has been fre- 
quently found in the titlark's nest. Until St Columba's lake was 
drained, it was yearly frequented by large flocks of swans, which 
seldom rested on any other lake in the parish. They appeared 
on the 1bi\\ of October annually, passed the winter on the lake, 
and remained in all about five months. In autumn after the lake 
was drained, they made their appearance at the usual time, but, 
on observing the destruction of their fi vourite haunt, they hover- 
ed with a cry of sadness for a brief period over it, then disappear- 
ed, and have seldom been seen since near the place. 

Perhaps the most remarkable species of birds which frequent 
the coast of the parish, is the puffin {Fratercidu arctica which 
appears annually in immense numbers at the island of Fladda- 
chuain, but seldom approaches nearer the shores of the parish. 
The bill of this bird is beautifully streaked with red and white 
stripes, and its form is singular, resembling two short broad blades 
of a knife, placed with their edges in opposition, and forming an 



ISLAND OF SKYE KILMUIR. 251 

acute splierical triangle. It is migratory, and most regular in its 
arrival and departure. About the beginning of May, this species 
of the aquatic tribes appears in vast numbers, literally covering the 
rocks, cliffs, and eminences of the island, and disappear exactly 
on the 12th of August. They are so rigidly impelled by instinct 
to observe their migrations, that, although thousands are seen on 
this little island on the 1 1th of August, there are scarcely any to 
be found on the 13th of the same month. Soon after their arri- 
val, they prepare for laying their eggs and hatching their young. 
It is said that the male, contrary to the usual economy of birds, 
undertakes the most arduous part of the process, and labours hard 
to prepare a secure locality for the deposition of the egg. They 
lay in burrows, which are dug horizontally in the ground, not in a 
straight line fr om the entrance, but in winding little passages from 
10 to 15 feet in length. The male, for the most part, undertakes 
the task of forming this little circuitous tunnel, and for that pur- 
pose he throws himself on his back, in which position he picks 
and digs with his hard sharp bill, and casts out the loose earth or 
mould with his broad webbed-feet. Where the ground is such 
that they cannot conveniently scoop out a passage, they enter the 
crevices of rocks and cairns, where they form a well-fortified nest. 
They lay only one egg, but if robbed of it, as they generally are 
by the natives, they lay again and again, but never more than a 
single egg. They are easily caught in their burrows, but when 
they find themselves closely hemmed in, and in great danger, they 
resort for security to the remote end of their subterraneous little 
passage, and thrust out their solitary egg, no doubt as a peace-of- 
fermg to their relentless pursuers ; but although the egg is accept- 
ed, yet the enemies rest not satisfied until the hapless ''tenants of 
the burrows fall victims to their merciless depredators. 

Kilmuir is not perhaps so much given to the rearing of sheep 
and cattle as some other parts of the island. This is accounted 
for by the great quantity of crop which is raised, in comparison 
with what IS raised in other districts of Skye.

sometimes seen ; but there is no instance known of their sting 
being deadly. The natives, in general, entertain an idea that 
cattle are stung or bitten by the toad, and some, by means of su- 
perstitious frets, pretend to effect a cure by certain charms, or by 
the repetition of some nonsensical rhyme. There seems to be no 
proper evidence that such swellings on cattle as are attributed to 
the poisonous bite of the toad are caused thereby, but may with 
greater propriety be laid to the charge of the serpent, which is 
well known to sting any animal which comes within its reach. 
Where cattle are stung by the serpent, the cure invariably resort- 
ed to is to wash the affected part of the suffering animal with wa- 
ter which had been poured over the preserved head of a serpent, 
and this process is considered an effectual remedy. Serpent's- 
heads are, therefore, considered very valuable, and are preserved 
with every possible care, provided the sting is retained in them, 
in which the healing virtue is supposed to exist. 

Insects. — No species of rare or uncommon insects are known to 
exist in the parish. In warm summer evenings the midge or He- 
bridean musquito, and the gad-fly or gleig, prove very annoying 
to labourers and others, and particularly so before rain. There 
are no bee-hives in the place ; but wild bees are some seasons nu- 
merous, and such as are generally seen are the Apis lapidaria and 
the A. muscorum. The caterpillars, as in most places, prove very 
destructive to fruit-trees and bushes, as well as to garden vege- 
tables. The most effectual remedy yet found to prevent their 
ravages, is to pick them carefully off all places where they appear. 
Grasshoppers are seldom seen ; but butterflies, white, scarlet, and 
spotted, are quite common. 

Fishes. — The various sorts of sea-fish are abundant. There 
are, however, no regularly established fisheries. Every family 
supplies itself; but it is only in calm weather that the people can 
go in quest of it, as the sea which surrounds the parish is ex- 
posed to almost every wind. Among the different kinds and classes 
of the finny tribe which frequent the coast are, the cod, ling, her- 
ring, thornback, skate, turbot, mackerel, horse-mackerel, whiting, 
eel, bream, hake, sythe, cuddy, cole-fish, dog-fish, king-fish, pipe- 
fish, pollack or lythe, grey and red gurnard, flounder, &amp;c.  

In the cetaceous order the spout or herring whale merits the 
first place. Greenland whales are also seen at times, and of an 
immense size. The porpoise or sea-hog, and whales of small size, 
are frequently observed playing in the Minsh. Seals are nume-

rous, but particularly so upon a dangerous reef of sunk rock call- 
ed Sgeir-nam-maol, which runs across part of the channel or 
Minsh, from JHunish point. Of cartilaginous fishes, the skate is 
reckoned by the natives the most valuable. The common sea- 
eel is taken in great quantities by means of long lines, and some 
of them are of great size. The ly the is looked upon as tine and de- 
licate in quality. Some autumns the gurnard appears in immense 
shoals, when boat loads of it are taken in a short period of time. 
The most successful bait for it is a piece of gurnard itself. Had- 
docks are comparatively rare, but were about half a century ago 
the most numerous of all fishes. The sythe, though dry and in- 
sipid, may be said to be of all fish the most useful to the natives, 
as it supplies them with oil for light, and other purposes. This 
oil is preferable for burning to train oil. The best season for it 
is autumn, when 80 to 100 sythes will yield an imperial gallon 
of oil. 

Fisheries. — At one period, the herring appeared in prodigious 
shoals, not only around the coast of the parish, but in all the 
lochs, creeks, and bays of the island. It then formed an exten- 
sive and lucrative source of traffic, and the benefits derived from 
it, by the country in general, were very great. It was caught at 
comparatively little expense, as the natives could, for the most 
part, make their own nets, and reach their own homes. In every 
creek and bay large fleets of schooners, brigs, sloops, wherries, 
and boats of all sizes and descriptions, were to be seen eagerly 
engaged in the securing of stores for private families, and of car- 
goes for the southern markets. Now the irregular appearance of 
this migratory fish, together with the small quantities of it which 
frequent, at the present day, its wonted haunts, have deprived the 
natives of one of their best sources of support, and have been in 
no small degree the means of reducing the redundant population 
to poverty, and of unfitting them to meet such seasons of destitu- 
tion as those of 1836 and 1837. 

Salmon is plentiful on the coast, but the only place where it 
spawns is the small river which runs into the bay of Altivaig. It 
goes up that stream if a little swollen with rain, about the 12th 
of August, and returns to the sea about Michaelmas. A salmon- 
fishery has been established for the last ten years, on the proper- 
ty of Lord Macdonald in this island, and the bay of Altivaig has 
proved one of its most successful stations. The whole is present- 
ly rented by John Wilson, Esq. Berwick-on- Tweed, and five years

are Still to expire of his lease. The quality of the salmon of thig 
parish is considered decidedly superior to that of any other station 
in Skye. It is caught solely by bag-nets, — preserved by pickling, 
— and sold at the London market. 

The shores abound with most, although not with all common 
shell-fish. Bivalves of various kinds are frequently found attach- 
ed to the fishermen's long lines, when lifted from the bottom of 
the deep. Lobsters, crabs, whelks, buckles, mussels, limpets, 
clams, cockles, &amp;c. are found in more or less abundance. Oys- 
ters and spout-fish are very rare. Some of these afford tempo- 
rary relief to many of the poor inhabitants in years of dearth. Dur- 
ing the late memorable seasons of scarcity the shores were literally 
covered with the starving natives, in quest of such little supplies of 
shell-fish as were left exposed by the ebbing of the tide. 

Limpets are much used as bait for catching sythe, cod, had- 
dock, and other fishes. There is no regular fishing apparatus for 
catching lobsters, crabs, clams, &amp;c. and on that account there are 
but small quantities of them procured for family use. 

Botany. — All sorts of vegetables for culinary purposes suc- 
ceed well, both in field and garden. There is also a variety of 
plants to which the natives attribute great medicinal virtues. 
No doubt some are found to be of use. The Geranium ro- 
hertianum is applied to sores and cutaneous eruptions, and the 
Cicuta virosa, or hemlock, to deeply-rooted tumours. Chamo- 
mile tea, and the juices of several other plants are used with 
benefit. Some of the natives pretend to great skill in point- 
ing out medicinal herbs, and the proper manner of applying 
them. It is supposed, however, that the healing quality of many 
of the herbs resorted to for cures, is more in the imagination of 
the people, than in the herbs themselves. Such medicinal pro- 
cesses are often attended with much nonsensical manoeuvres, and 
superstitious ceremonies. 

Besides the medicinal plants, others are successfully used for 
the purposes of dyeing colours and tanning leather. By means of 
the common heath, a yellow is produced, and with the addition of 
indigo, a green. The bark or branches of the alder-tree, with 
sulphate of iron or copperas, dyes an excellent black. 

Although in bygone ages, the parish must have been wooded, 
as is proved by the remains of trees found in mosses and in other 
situations, yet it does not seem to be now adapted for the growth 
of almost any species of timber. Where trees attain a certain

height, they invariably wither. None are therefore found in it, 
with the exception of a little brush-wood in two or three places. 
With the view of making a fair experiment, as to the growth of 
wood, the late noble proprietor planted, in 1831, about ten acres 
of enclosed ground, with the following kinds of trees, viz. larch, 
ash, spruce, mountain-ash, silver-fir, elm, beech, and Huntingdon 
willow ; but all of them have long ago decayed. Bushes for small 
fruit thrive well, provided they be enclosed, and sheltered in fen- 
ced gardens. 

The rocks and rugged recesses abound with garlic and other 
strongly scented herbs, which frequently, in consequence of their 
being cropped by cattle, give a disagreeable taste to milk and but- 
ter. There seem to be no uncommon plants in the parish. The 
foUowins list embraces a few of such as are met with in more 
or less abundance.

II. — Civil History. 

The early history of the parish is involved in impenetrable ob- 
scurity. The aborigines of this and the surrounding isles, ac- 
cording to the best historical traditions, were a mixture of the 
ancient Caledonians or Picts-, and the Albanaich, or first settlers, 
in what is now known by the kingdom of Scotland. The general 
character of the original population, it is said, was considerably 
changed by an influx of the cognate Celtic race of Scots, imme- 
diately after the Scottish conquest ; but this change was, in rea- 
lity, small, in comparison with that effected by the Vikingr, or pi- 
ratical kings from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. These Scan- 
dinavian rovers appeared on the east coast of England about 
A. D. 785, and a century, at least, before they obtained a footing in 
any of the north Hebrides. The accession of the bloody King, 
Harold Harfager, to the entire kingdom of Norway, a. d. 880, 
urged many of his opponents and powerful subjects to escape his

vengeance, by leaving their native land, and by procuring a set- 
tlement for themselves by force of arms in this and other islands 
around. Having once obtained possession of their new territo- 
ries, they resolved to make piratical attacks upon their native 

land, on account of Harold's previous cruelty and vengeance ; 

and this procedure provoked the King of Norway and his allies 
to dispatch a fleet to the Isles, by which they were ultimately sub- 
dued, and added to the crown of Norway. The aborigines of the 
Isles had cause to deplore the barbarities of their new oppressors, 
by whom the « cills" and places of worship erected some centuries 
before, by the Culdees, the pious disciples of St Columba, were 
entirely demolished ; and ravages and desolations of the most 
sweeping description ensued. That the territory which consti- 
tutes this parish suffered from the effects of these disturbances is 
evident, from its situation being such, that it would be the first 
landmg place of the enemy in their piratical excursions from the 
north, and from the fact, that it was strongly secured by the erec- 
tion of many duns or forts, the ruins of which are still distinctly 
visible. 

It would be needless, and would serve no useful end in this ac- 
count, to attempt making mention of the succession of Vikingrs, 
or Kings of the' Isles, up to the beginning of the twelfth century, 
when the powerful dynasty of MacDhonuill, or Lords of the Isles, 
had its origin. The great and warlike family of MacDhonuill 
sprung from Somerled, Lord of Argyle, and were, for a succes- 
sion of centuries, justly renowned for their many achievements and 
military prowess. 

At the defeat of the Norwegians at the battle of Largs in 
Ayrshire, in the reign of Alexander III. the Western Isles were 
ceded to the kingdom of Scotland, part of which they form to this 
day. Numerous and intricate were the feuds and quarrels which 
existed between the septs and clans of the Western Isles, by which 
the peace of these localities was molested for many subsequent 
centuries. 

The islanders were so frequently divided by factions, and their 
mutual feuds were at times so violent, that Government more than 
once deemed it prudent to interfere, for the purpose of reconcilia- 

• Of Somerled tliere are many traditions still floating among the natives. He was 

known by the appellation of " Soirlo Mac Ghillebride na h-Uamha" Somerled, 

the son of Gilbride of the cave. A full-length portrait of Somerled is beautifully 
executed in stained glass in one of the windows of Armadale Castle, Lord Mac- 
donald's seat in Skye.

tion. In the year 1528, great disturbances arose in this, and the 
adjoining parishes of Troternish, in consequence of a feud between 
the Clann Donuill and the Macleods of Harris. The office of 
BalHary of all Troternish was granted by royal charter to Alex- 
ander Macleod of Dunvegan, while, a few weeks afterwards, the 
same office was similarly granted to Torquil Macleod of Lewis. 
Under these circumstances, Donull Gruamach mac Dhonuill 
Ghallaich of Sleat assembled his forces, and was successful in ex- 
pelling Macleod of Dunvegan and his clan from the barony of Tro- 
ternish. After the death of Donull Gruamach, Dunvegan renew- 
ed hostilities, and resolved by every possible means to regain pos- 
session of Troternish. Donull Gorm, the son and successor of 
Donull Gruamach, entered Troternish in May 1539, and, with a 
strong body of his adherents, laid waste the country with fire and 
sword. There are still traditions of the hardships and calamities 
to which the inhabitants of this parish were then exposed. Some 
days subsequent to this invasion, Donull Gorm passed over from 
Troternish to Kintailj with a view to be revenged on Mackenzie, 
on account of his hostility to his pretensions. In an attempt to 
take Mackenzie's castle at Elandonnan by surprise, Donull Gorm 
lost his life, by an arrow directed against him from the battlements 
of the fortress. 

The excesses to which these disastrous feuds were carried ar- 
rested the attention of James V. ; and, with a determination to check 
them in future, not only in this part of Skye, but in all the Western 
Isles, he resolved to appear in person before the various chieftains of 
the Isles. For this purpose, his Majesty, with a considerable fleet, 
left the Forth in May 1540, and, sailing round the north of Scot- 
land, called at Lewis, where he took on board Macleod of that 
island, whence, passing over to Skye, he took along with him Mac- 
leod of Dunvegan, and then directing his course eastward, visited 
Troternish, still bearing marks of its late desolation. Tradition 
says, that his Majesty minutely inspected and greatly admired the 
fortress of Duntulm, the residence, in this parish, for many cen- 
turies, of the noble Clann Donuill. Here he was met by a num- 
ber of chieftains, who claimed relationship to the Lords of the Isles.f 

 Elandonnan fortress, at the time, had but few men in garrison, and Mackenzie being 
absent, it is very probable that it would have been taken, were it not that Donull 
Gorm received a wound in the thigh, from a barbed arrow, which he pulled out 
with such violence as to sever the main artery. The blood, of course, flowed copi- 
ously, and all the means which were used to check its effusion proved ineffectual. He 
was hastily conveyed; to a little island at some distance, where he had been but a 
short period when he died,

Setting- sail from Duntulm, the fleet doubled tiie northern point 
of Skye, and coasting it southward in the channel which separates 
Skye from the mainland, cast anchor at Portree, now the capital 
of the island, and deriving its name from that royal visit. Leav- 
ing this harbour, his Majesty proceeded southward through the 
Kyles of Skye, and, after visiting in succession the rest of the He- 
brides, landed at Dumbarton Castle. 

About the year 1580, a secret plot was laid to deprive Donull 
Gorm M6r of his property. This Donull Gorm Mor was the 
grandson of Donull Gorm, who died at Elandonnan. The plot was 
devised and artfully carried on against the proprietor by his own 
nephew, Uistean Mac Ghilleaspuig Chlirich, Hugh, the son 
of Archibald, the Clerk, who was a very powerful and treacherous 
man. Seeing that his uncle, Donull Gorm, had no issue, and 
that the property would, in consequence, devolve upon his elder 
brother, Donull Gorm 6g Mac Ghilleaspuig Chk'irich, he resolv- 
ed to usurp it by power and stratagem. For this purpose, he se- 
cretly contrived to gain over to his cause as many of the clan as 
possible, at the same time pretending to his uncle to be on the 
best possible terms with him. The first preparation for the ac- 
complishment of his schemes, was the building of a large tower 
or castle on the farm of Peinduin, in the adjoining parish of Sni- 
zort. This tower, still called " caisteal Uistein," i. e. Hugh's 
Castle, was never entirely finished. It was erected on a rock by 
the sea side, and had neither door nor windows, but was to be 
entered on the top, by means of ladders, which could be pulled up 
and let down at pleasure. The ruins of this castle are still seve- 
ral feet in height. It is said that Donull Gorm had but little 
suspicion of his nephew's intrigues, until he commenced the build- 
ing of this unique fortress, which he did under other pretences, bv the 
permission of his uncle. A few years afterwards, however, Donull 
Gorm had more direct proof of his nephew's intentions. Having 
had occasion to pay a visit to his kinsman at Dunyveg, in Isla, he 
set out from his castle at Duntulm, with a retinue of his vassals and 

Lewis, as also Alexander Ma. lcod of Dunvegaii, and his chief vassals in that part of 
Skye, he was met at Duntulm hy Glengarry, several principal men of t\\e Clann 
Donuill, Iain Muideartach, and others, who severally accompanied the fleet to the 
south. The King having landed at Dumbarton, sent the fleet, with the captive 
chiefs, and their principal adherents, round by the north to Leith. 

 Portree is a Gaelic name, which signifies the King's harbour. The name 
of the bay at Portree, previous to the royal visit in question, was " Loch Choluim- 
Cille," that is, St Columba's-bay. There is a small island in the bay, which still 
retains the name of " Eilan Choluim Cille," viz. the Island of St Columba.

friends. When on the coast of Jura, they were overtaken by a 
storm, which forced them to land on the property of Maclean of 
Duart, in that Isle. It happened that the same storm made the 
usurper, Uistean, and some of his adherents, take shelter in a bay, 
quite contiguous to where his uncle had landed. As soon as night 
had come on, Uistean, fully aware of his uncle's situation, carried 
off a number of Maclean's cattle, and set sail for the north, know- 
ing well that, as his visit to the place was unknown to Duart, 
Donull Gorm and his retinue would be accused as the perpetra- 
tors. Such was the case next day, — when the cattle were amis- 
sing, the Skyemen were attacked by a strong body of Duart's re- 
tainers. Many of the Macdonalds fell in the skirmish, and their 
chief narrowly escaped, by getting into one of his galleys, and set- 
ting sail for Skye. This insidious conduct on the part of Uistean 
was the cause of a violent feud between the Macdonalds and the 
Macleods, and matters assumed an aspect so serious that the king 
had to interfere to etFect a reconciliation. Soon after Donull 
Gorm's return at that time to his castle at Duntulm, he had a 
letter from his treacherous nephew Uistean, which was the means 
of bringing his plots clearly to light. Uistean being in Uist, with 
a view to procure as many adherents as possible, wrote a letter to 
one of his confederates in Skye, revealing all his plans, while, at 
the same time, he wrote another letter, full of friendly expres- 
sions, to his uncle at Duntulm. It is said, that while both letters 
were closed and sealed, he committed an egregious mistake for 
his own unrighteous cause, by addressing his confederate's letter 
to his uncle, and vice versa ; by which awkward oversight, Donull 
Gorm was, from Uistean's own handwriting, led to a knowledge 
of all his schemes. Before the usurper was aware of what he had 
done, Donull Gorm despatched a messenger to his kinsman and 
relative, Donull Maclain 'ic Sheumais in Uist, to seize Uistean, 
and bring him prisoner to Duntulm. Without loss of time Donull 
Maclain put his liege-lord's instructions into execution. He re- 
sorted to the house where Uistean resided, and as he approached 
it with a strong retinue of men, the usurper, dreading that all was 
not right, and seeing the impossibility of effecting his escape, had 
barely time to dress himself in female attire, and to commence grind- 
ing with a quern, or hand-mill, at which the inmates had been at 
the time engaged. The size, and masculine appearance of the 
grinder soon attracted the notice of the party when they entered 
the house. They laid hold of him, but his great agility and bodily

strength, together with his being rendered violent through despair, 
made it doubtful for a time whether or not the party could re- 
tain liim. At length, being encumbered with his dress, and unable 
any longer to defend himself against the men who surrounded him, 
he was, seized, and fastly bound, and carried prisoner to the family 
seat in this parish. He was cast into the dungeon of the castle, 
which was a dark, secluded vault on the ground-floor of the edifice, 
where he was chained in the centre of the apartment. He was fed 
on salt beef, and when he stretched forth his hand to grasp a 
covered pitcher which was placed near him, and which he no doubt 
supposed to contain water, he found it empty  Writhing in agony 
with thirst, he found neither alleviation nor repose, until death put 
an end to his sufferings. 

The next circumstance which merits particular notice, as hav- 
ing occurred in the parish and districts adjacent, is the letting of 
the lands of Troternish, together with the Island of Lewis, to a 
Lowland Company, at a stipulated rent, that they might improve 
the same, according to directions prescribed by the King, James 
VI. The Company, however, soon found cause to relinquish their 
engagements, and to leave the lands to the management of those 
chiefs who maintained a preferable right of occupancy, f 

Three years after the granting of the above lease, viz. in a. d. 
1601, the peace of the parish, in common with the rest of Mac- 
Dhonuill's estates in Skye and Uist, was in no small degree dis- 
turbed by a bloody feud which broke out between the two power- 
ful chiefs MacDhonuill and Macleod of Dunvegan. The quar- 
rel arose from some private affairs connected with their families. 
Ruairidh Macleod of Dunvegan, having assembled his vassals and 
clan, invaded the barony of Troternish, and carried fire and sword 
into every district of it. DonuU Gorm raor, on the other hand, 
with a powerful retinue of his clan, entered the Island of Harris, 
then the property of Macleod of Dunvegan, and caused it to suf- 
fer in a similar manner. For the purpose of being revenged, 

 Uistean's remains were interred in the parisli burying-ground. Some ages after- 
wards, his skull and thigh bones were exhumed, no doubt as curiosities, owing to their 
immense size. They were lying for many years about the walls and recesses of the 
old church, until they were again committed to the dust about sixteen years ago. 

f According to Gregory and others, the Lowland company consisted of the Duke 
of Lennox; Patrick, Commendator of Lindorcs ; Wilham, Commendatorof Pitien- 
weem; Sir James Anstruther; Sir James Sandilands of Slamanno ; James Leir- 
mont of Balcolmy ; James Spens of Wormestown ; John Forret of Fingask ; Pavid 
Home of Wedderburne ; and Captain William Murray. i 

The annual rent for Troternish was fixed at 400 merks, and the date of the lease 
was -May 1598,

Macleod sent a party of men under a choice leader to destroy 
MacDhonuiU's estate in Uist, but they were there met and rout- 
ed with much bloodshed, by MacDhonuiU's kinsman already men- 
tioned, viz. DonuU Maclain 'ic Sheumais. During these dis- 
astrous conflicts, the estates of both chiefs were very much injured ; 
and the natives were reduced to great hardships, by being daily in 
terror of their lives, and by neglecting to cultivate their lands to 
make provision for themselves and families. At length, affairs 
came to be decided by a pitched battle. MacDhonuill collected 
his forces, and Macleod did the same. The two great chiefs at 
the head of their warriors, met in close vicinity to the lofty mount 
CuUin, and after a desperate and bloody conflict, in which both 
clans fought with distinguished bravery, the Macleods were rout- 
ed with great slaughter. 

It would be impossible within the limits of this account to relate 
the various little feuds and differences which disturbed the repose 
of the parish, in Common with the rest of the estates of the power- 
ful Macdonald family, down to the period of the battle of Killie- 
crankie in 1689, and of Sheriff"muir in 1715. No fewer than five 
cousins of Sir Donald Macdonald of the Isles fell on the bloody 
field of Killiecrankie, fighting on the side of Dundee. Sir Donald 
Macdonald, commonly called Donull a' chogaidh, led forth a strong 
body of chosen men from this and the adjacent parishes, to the 
battle of Sheriffmuir, where they distinguished themselves by their 
wonted bravery. But neither of these engagements created such 
a sensation in this place as did the Rebellion of 1745. It is well 
known, that, had Sir Alexander Macdonald and Macleod of Dun- 
vegan joined the standard of the unfortunate Prince Charles Ed- 
ward Stuart, the fate of Culloden would have been diiferent. 
The joint forces of these powerful chiefs were at the time nearly 
4000 strong. Clanranold was despatched to Skye to hasten the 
two chiefs just named, to join the Prince's cause. He found them 
both at Monkstadt, in this parish, the residence at that time of Sir 
Alexander Macdonald. The envoy's entreaties were in vain, for, 
however much disposed these chieftains might have been at first 
to assist the Chevalier, they evidently saw by that time that his 
cause was hopeless, and they prudently kept aloof. 

• It is said, when the DuVe of Cumberland met Sir Alexander Macdonald, after 
the battle of Culloden, that he addressed him—," Ho is tliis the great rebel of the 
Isles"— and that Sir Alexander instantly replied—" No, my Lord Duke, for had 1 
been the rebel of the Isles, your Grace would not have crossed the Spey."

Miss Flora Macdonald.~The story of the heroic conduct of Miss 
i-lora Macdonald in conducting the unfortunate Charles in the dis- 
guise of a maid-servant from the Long Island to Monkstadtin this 
parish, is so well known that any detail of it here is unnecessary. 

Many were the trials and severe the hardships which fell to the 
lot of the gallant Miss Flora, subsequent to this adventure. She 
was soon seized and brought prisoner to London, where she was, 
with Kingsburgh, and many others, confined ia the Tower. All 
admired the dauntless part which she had acted, and her case ex- 
cited so much interest, that she was visited by the great and noble 
of the land. Among the rest, she had the honour of a visit from 
Prince Frederick of Wales, great-grandfather of her present Ma- 
jesty Queen Victoria. This generous prince was so much struck 
with the simplicity and dignity of the fair prisoner's character that 
he interested himself to procure her liberation  When she had 
obtained her freedom, she found refuge in the house of Lady 
Primrose of Dunnipace, where she was visited and loaded with 
honours by distinguished personages of all ranks and shades of 
politics. Returning to her native isle, she was married in the 
month of November 1750, to Allan, son of Mr Alexander Mac- 
donald of Kingsburgh, who resided at the time of his marriage at 
Flodigarry, in this parish. Upon the death of her husband's 
father, his son, Allan, succeeded him, and Flora, then Mrs 
Allan Macdonald, became lady of the mansion of Kingsburgh. 
She afterwards went to North Carolina with her husband, where 
he took part in the civil war which then disturbed the peace of 
that country. After undergoing many hardships in that quarter, 
they deemed it prudent to return to Skye. The vessel in which 
they sailed from America was met by a French privateer, and an 

• It is said that when Flora was liberated, she used her influence to procure tlie 
liberation of Kingsburgh, as also of Donald Macleod of Galtrigal, and of Ca/um 
mac lain mhic Iain, who went in the capacity of guide with the Prince from Kasay 
to Kilmorie in Strathaird. It is said that Kingsburgh was arrested in tJie following 
manner: Some days after the Prince was there, Captain Ferguson of the Goveru- 
ment war ship, cast anchor at the " Crannag," near Kingsburgh House, and, having 
gone ashore, met Kingsburgh's dairy-maid attending some cattle. He entered into 
conversation with the maid, and, suspecting that she might have some news for him, 
induced her to go to see the vessel. When on board he treated her kindly, and gave 
her some little presents; then asking her about various circumstances relative to 
country news, she not knowing who her entertainer was, told, with an air of pride, 
that she had seen Prince Charles ; that he was a night at her master's liouse ; that her 
mistress and other ladies who were there at the time, got beautiful locks of his hair ; and 
that his appearance pleased her much. This was all that Ferguson wanted, and, by 
means of this imprudent disclosure on the part of the unsuspecting maid, the first 
certain proof was obtained of the manner in which Kingsburgh had acted, as well as 
of the certainty that the Prince had landed in Skye from Uist.

action took place, in which Flora appeared on deck, where, with her 
wonted magnanimity, she inspired the seamen with courage, and 
assr.red them of success. ■ Although her arm was broken in the 
engagement, yet her native spirit of heroism was not in the least 
degree damped. She never more left Skye. She had seven 
children, five sons and two daughters, besides some who died in 
infancy ; all her sons were officers, who distinguished themselves 
in the service of their king and country. Her daughters, on the 
other hand, became officers' wives. Ann was the lady of Major 
Alexander Macleod, and died at Stein, in this island, about six 
years ago. Her second daughter, Frances, was married to Lieu- 
tenant Donald Macdonald of Cuiderach. Of this interesting fa- 
mily, none are now alive. The celebrated Flora lived to an ad- 
vanced period of life, and retained to the last that vivacity of cha- 
racter and that amiableness of disposition, by which she was al- 
ways distinguished. On the 5th of March 1790, she departed 
this life, little more than two years before the death of her hus- 
band. Her remains were interred in the burying-ground of this 
parish, within a square piece of coarse wall, which was erected 
about the year 1766 to enclose the tombs of the Kingsburgh fa- 
mily. Her funeral, it is said, was attended by no fewer than 3000 
individuals, of every rank and class, and all were liberally served 
with refreshments. 

Now that the spirit of Jacobitism is gone, and the world at large 

' In the same burying-place various members of the Kingsburgh fiimily were in- 
terred, as may be seen from the following inscription on a marble slab, which was 
procured many years ago by Lieutenant- Colonel John Macdonald of Exeter, to be 
placed over his mother's  Flora's grave. The slab was, however, broken in convey- 
ing it to this place from the south ; and no fragment of it is now left by touristSi 
who have carried it oft' in pieces as curiosities. 'J he inscription was as follows : 

" In the family mausoleum at Kilmuir, lie interred the remains of the following 
members of the Kingsburgh family, viz. Alexander Macdonald of Kingsburgh ; his 
son Allan, his sons Charles and James ; his .son John, and two daughters ; and of 
Flora Macdonald, who died in March 1790, aged 68 A name that will be mention- 
ed in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour." — " She 
was a woman of middle stature, soft features, gentle manners, and elegant presence. 
So wrote Johnson." 

The above confused inscription embraces the n.ames of most of the Kingsburgh 
family, whose remains slumber within the square piece of rude building, already al- 
luded to. The remains of Flora's last surviving daughter, Mrs Major Macleod, were 
consigned to their kindred dust about six years since. The said Mrs Major Macleod 
has left only one daughter, Miss Mary Macleod, still alive at Stein. 

Dr Johnson and his fellow-traveller Boswell, while on their tour through the He- 
brides in 1773, visited Flora and family at Kingsburgh, and were much struck with 
that lady's appearance, and elegance of manners. So great was Flora's enthusiasm 
for the prince andhi.i success, that she carried with her to America a part of the sheet 
in which he slept at Kingsburgh, intending that, when, or where she might die, it 
should be used for her shroud. She brought it back from America, and it in said, 
that, according to her own request, it was tlie shroud in which she was lowered into 
the grave.

has ceased to regard the claims of the house of Stuart, it is a mat- 
ter of regret that the dust of the memorable Flora, in whose bosom 
that spirit, so lofty and chivalrous, burned with such unexampled 
fervour, should be allowed to moulder without a monument of the 
meanest description to mark her tomb. In this age, so remark- 
able for the zeal displayed in rearing memorials for distinguished 
characters, it is surprising that no spirited individuals have stepped 
forward to erect, by public subscription or otherwise, some monu- 
ment over the ashes of one so justly celebrated and so universally 
admired. In all quarters of the kingdom, burying-grounds are to 
be seen crowded with every variety of tombs, excelling each other 
in neatness of workmanship, and in elegance of inscriptions ; while 
the remains of the memorable Flora are allowed to crumble un- 
der a green solitary turf, without a stone to mark the spot, or even 
a rude flag with the initials of her name to catch the traveller's eye. 

Soon after the suppression of the Rebellion, when the isles were 
ransacked by Government forces in search of the ill-fated Prince, 
Major Allan Macdonald, alias Ailean a Chnoic, who was a staunch 
adherent of the Government, harboured, as it would appear, some ill 
will towards his chief. Sir Alexander Macdonald. In consequence 
of this, it is alleged that he informed Captain Ferguson that Sir 
Alexander possessed a great stock of arms at Monkstadt no 
doubt, insinuating that they might be used at some future period 
in the cause of the Chevalier. Sir Alexander having heard what 
Allan had done, and in order to avoid any such suspicions being 
entertained against him, gave instructions to throw the arms into 
the sea. They were accordingly conveyed to a boat, and consign- 
ed to the deep near Kilbride, the place at which the Prince and 
Flora landed in this parish. 

Ancient Families. — The Macqueens of Garafad, the Martins, 
and others, were ancient families of some note in the parish. Tra- 
dition says, that, at some remote period, twenty young men, of 
each of three clans, or tribes, were given to the proprietor, as a 
dowry with his wife, Nighean Chathain, from Ireland, as men in 
those days were more valuable than money. It is alleged, that 
the Macqueens, Martins, &amp;c. are their descendants. The Mac- 
queens had the farm of Garafad for many centuries free, with the 

• Ailcan a' Chnoic was father to General Donald Madonald, Colonel of the 55th 
foot, who was wounded in Holland in 1799, and died in London. Major Allan used 
the Jacobites very harshly in Uist, and in other quarters, so that he was no favourite 
with any who had embraced the Prince's cause. After the Rebellion, he left the coun- 
try, and died in the town of Ayr.

exception that they had to give a certain number of salmon, at a 
fixed price, annually to the proprietor. It is said that they got 
deeply in arrears with their salmon rent, and, being unable to pay 
the same when demanded, lost their tenure. A Mrs Macqueen, 
the relict of the last of the family, had a pendicle of the farm un- 
til the day of her death. 

Land-owners and Residence. — The most entire ruin in the pa- 
rish, is the magnificent Castle of Duntulm, the ancient residence 
of the family of Macdonaldj the illustrious descendants of So- 
merled, Rex Insularum. This dun or fort was built on a lofty, 
perpendicular, sea-beaten rock, and, from its situation, must have 
been impregnable, both from sea and land. It was originally a 
Danish fort, which was rebuilt by the powerful Clann Donuill 
for a family seat. It is said that this distinguished clan made 
choice of this place as the site of their castle, because it was, at 
the time of the Norwegian Conquest, the residence of David, one 
of the most powerful of the Vikingr, or piratical kings, who in- 
vaded the island. It was anciently known by the name of Dun 
Dhaibhidh, or David's Fort, and the word David was inscribed 
on a stone in the front of the original tower, but that stone, and 
many others, having sculptured figures upon them, were taken 
away as curiosities. This superb edifice was, from time imme- 
morial, the birth-place of many gallant heroes, renowned charac- 
ters, and eminent men of that powerful clan. Most of these, 
though not all, were interred in a plot in the parish burying-ground, 
called Reileag Mhoir Chloinn Donuill, or the large cemetery of 
the Macdonalds. The Macdonalds have for ages been justly 
distinguished as the best and most indulgent of proprietors. The 
family residence is now Armadale Castle, in the parish of Sleat. 

Antiquities. — The ruins of cills, or Culdee chapels, as has al- 
ready been noticed, are very numerous. The monastery, which 
was erected by St Columba on an island, in the now drained lake 
of Colum-cille, bears every mark of having been an extensive and 
firmly-built edifice. It is now almost level with the ground ; still 
the foundation can be distinctly traced. 

There was a fane, or temple, now in ruins, in the above-men- 
tioned island of Fladda-chuain, supposed to have been built by 
the Druids, who, according to tradition, went thither once a year 
to worship and feast. There were nine smooth stones used by 
them in their religious ceremonies, each about a foot in length. 
They remained entire, and might still have been seen there had

they not been, of late years, stolen as curiosities by some persons 
unknown. There were three burying-places in this snnall island, 
one of which is named to this day Cladh-Mhanaich, that is, the 
monks' burying-place. 

The forts of the parish are six in number, viz. Dun-Scudde- 
burgh, Dun-Liatb, Diin-Bhannerain, Dun-Barplacaig, Dun-Tulm, 
and Dun-Deirg. It is well ascertained, that most of these duns, 
or forts, are Danish. The last mentioned, however, seems to 
have been erected by the Druids. It is known tliat Dargo was a 
brave and warlike Druid, who attempted to restore the fallen dig- 
nity of his order. Ossian, the celebrated Celtic bard, makes 
mention of Dearg nan Druidhean, that is, Dargo of the Druids, 
or Dargo the Druid. We have, therefore, here, Dun-Deirg, 
which is, the fort of Dargo, about which many little traditions are 
still afloat among the old men of the country. Several tiers of 
stone still remain in some of these forts ; and, from the immense 
size of most of the blocks which were used, it appears wonderful 
how they could have been raised from the ground, unless very strong 
mechanical powers were made to act upon them. It is evident 
from the situation of these forts that they were intended to give 
each other an alarm at the approach of an enemy, as they are in- 
variably found to be in sight of each other. The signal which 
was given, as may be gathered from ancient traditions and songs, 
consisted of something which was set on fire for the purpose, and 
the burning light was held up upon the turrets of the Fort, by 
what was called the crois-tdraidh, or crdnn-tdraidh, that is, 
a fire-cross, or gathering-beam. The crois-taraidh was made 
use of in various manners. Sometimes it consisted of a piece of 
wood half-burnt, then dipped in the blood of a goat, lamb, or 
any other animal, and finally circulated by emissaries as a signal 
of distress. Under the feudal system, the crann-taraidh was used 
at a period not very remote. It is spoken of by Ossian, and UUin, 
as well as by several modern Celtic bards. 

 When one chief had a feud with another, and wished to call his retainers speedi- 
ly together, he dispatched a messenger to the nearest hamlet, with the blood-stained 
beam of alarm, who would deliver it to the first he met, and would only mention the 
place of rendezvous. The beam would then be similarly delivered in the next ham- 
let, and so on until it passed through the hamlets of several districts, and thus the 
vassals of the chief would appear at the appointed gathering station, in a few hours. 
Should any one presume to disobey the call of this blood-stained, though mute mes. 
senger of slaughter, he speedily forfeited his life for his neglect. It is said, thai, in 
the year 1745, the craiin taraidh was made to pass through every hamlet in Breadal- 

baiie in three liours.

There was an old chapel in the parish caWed Pein-na-cille, where 
there were two erect stones, at which the Druids are said to have 
worshipped. These stones were evidently part of a Druidical cir- 
cle, but were taken down some time ago, and human bones were 
discovered around them. Old men remark that there were an- 
ciently many Druidical circles and places of worship, the remnants 
of which have been destroyed by the progress of agriculture and 
other causes. There are vestiges of cairns and circles near the 
farm-house of Lonfern, at a place still called Totagan nan Druid- 
hean. i. e. the little knolls of the Druids. Of old there were many 
erect stones in the place, as also cairns piled up in the form of a 
cone, with flat stones on their top, on which, it is said, sacrificing 
fires were kindled ; but most of these relics have been destroyed. 

When the lake of Colum-cille was drained, in or about the year 
1763, there was an oaken boat discovered deeply imbedded in the 
bottom of the lake. It would seem, from its situation, that it must 
have been there for many ages. This boat, although not large in 
size, is said to have been much stronger, and far more firmly built 
than any of modern date. The iron rings which were fastened in 
the ends of it, were of almost incredible thickness, so much so, 
that they were converted into sockets for instruments used in the 
parish for tilling the ground. 

Parochial Registers. — Kilrauir has not the advantage of a pa- 
rochial register, of a later date than 1822. If there were any pre- 
vious to that date, they were either lost or destroyed. There are 
several excellent maps and surveys of the parish in the proprie- 
tor's possession, and in particular a nicely executed plan by Mr 
Matthew Stobie, in the year 1766. 

The Presbyterian ministers in the parish have been, Mr Kenneth 
Bethune, ofiiciating in Kilmuir and in part of Snizort; Mr Do- 
nald Macqueen ; Mr Donald Martin, late of Abernethy, in Strath- 
spey; Mr Donald Ross, presently minister of Loth, in Suther- 
landshire; and the present incumbent. These, with the exception 
of some missionaries, are supposed to have been the only Presbyterian 
ministers who were settled in the parish. Messrs Donald and Al'ex-

ander Nicolson, and others were in the place, but it is said that 
they belonged to the Episcopalian Church. 

Modern Buildings. — There are no modern buildings in the pa- 
rish, with the exception of the Government church and manse at 
SteinschoU, and it maybe added, the parochial schoolmaster's dwel- 
ling-house, and farm-steadings. Both Scotch and foreign timber is 
used for building. As no lime is manuftictured in the parish, it is 
generally conveyed by sea from Broadford, where" Lord Macdonald 
allows it to his tenants, at a lower rate than what it can be disposed 
of to those from another property. The hamlets and cottages of 
the letters or small tenants are but of inferior construction. They 
are generally built of rude stone, and the intervening chinks are 
filled with dry mould in place of lime or mortar. As no wood for 
roofing grows in the place, the same is purchased on the mainland, 
and conveyed by sea to the parish. The roof of a letter's dwelling 
consists of six or eight rude cupples, made of unsquared timber, 
over which a few beams are laid transversely to support the " keb- 
bers," which in their turn support the turf and straw made use of 
as thatch. It must be acknowledged that there is as yet a want 
of cleanliness and comfort displayed in the construction of many of 
these dwellings. Notwithstanding the march of general improve- 
ments, still many of the Hebridean crofters, actuated by ancient 
prejudices and mistaken ideas, admit their cattle under the same 
roof with themselves. The houses generally consist of three 
apartments, which are separated either by stone walls or partitions 
made of wattled-work, straw, or reeds. The middle apartment is 
the one principally occupied by the family, who have the fire in 
the centre of the floor, over which the crook is suspended from 
the rafters above. On the one side of the fire, a wooden bench or 
rude sofa is placed, of sufficient size to contain five or six people, 
while on the other side is found the good-wife's " sunnag" or rus- 
tic arm-chair, of plaited straw, near which are the cradle, spin- 
ning-wheel, ' amraidh," or cup-board, a large covered pot con- 
taining the kelt for family dress, undergoing the slow process of 
indigo dye, and the other paraphernalia which are indispensable 
for immediate family use. The inmost apartment serves the pur- 
poses of barn or bed-room, sometimes both, while that next the 
door is occupied by the cattle. The houses are, for the most part, 
annually unroofed, for the purpose of applying the sooty turf and 
thatch, as manure for the potato ground. 

There are three meal-mills in the parish, one in each district.

and all impelled by water. They are firmly built, slated, and well- 
finished. They consist of strong machinery, and are kept in good 
repair. Mill-stones, when required, are procured in the island 
of Rasay, of a suitable quality for the grinding of oats and barley. 

III. — Population. 

It is quite impossible, in the present day, to specify numerically 
the amount of population in remote times. It is, however, per- 
fectly well ascertained, that it must have been very small, as is 
evident from the fact, that farms which presently support fifty or 
sixty families were occupied, about half a century ago, by no more 
than the tenth part of that number. 

The civil parish consists of three districts, as already specified, 
viz. those of Kilmuir and Kilmaluag, which now constitute that 
part of the parish which remains attached to Kilmuir church ; and 
the district of Steinscholl, which is attached to the Government 
church some time ago erected there. 

By a census which was carefully taken up by the writer of this 
account, in January 1837, the population of these several districts 
stood as follows :

Total population of the whole original undivided parish, . . 4011 

The population of the whole united parish was in the year 1736 
only 1230 souls. Nineteen years afterwards it amounted, accord- 
ing to Dr Webster, to 1572. 

In the year 1771, it was, according to Dr Walker, 1900 
1791, . . . 2060 

1801, . . . 2355 

1808, . . . 2993 

1831, . . . 3415 

By the census taken in January 1837, . 4011 souls.  

The annual average number of marriages for the five years im- 
mediately preceding 1827 was about 21, while the same owing 
to the adoption of salutary checks, which will be afterwards ad- 
verted to, does not exceed 6 for the last twelve months. The 
average number of individuals in each family is 5f nearly. 

In the two districts attached to Kilmuir church, there were 421 
families in January 1837, and only 190 divisions of land, in the 
shape of lots, crofts, and farms. Of these 421 families, 231 held 
no possessions whatever from the proprietor, but lived as a burden 
and drawback on the occupiers of the 190 divisions, either in the 
humble capacity of cottars, or as under tenants, who held shares 
of the said 190 divisions under the baneful system of sub-letting. 
As this process of sub-letting was annually progressing, the popu- 
lation, as a matter of course, was rapidly increasing, until it accu- 
mulated to an amount by far too large for being comfortably sup- 
ported by the produce or agricultural returns of the parish. 
Hence the origin of a redundant population; and while that re- 
dundancy is permitted to continue, destitution and poverty, toge- 
ther with a train of concomitant evils, will be the sure but unhap- 
py results. 

From what has been stated, it will be seen, that, during the last six- 

' It will be observed that there is an apparent increase of 596 souls in the parish 
in the six years between 1831 and 1837 ; but it is only apparent, as the census of 
1831, by being taken in summer, was under the real amount of population, as many 
were out of the country in quest of employinent, who were not taken into the account. 
Tle time of the year in which the census is taken has a material effect on the results 
arrived at. If taken in the summer months, many of the inhabitants are out of the 
parish at fishing stations and public works. A census taken in the Hebridean parishes 
in the summer season is sure to give incorrect returns, unless the Government regula- 
tions in regard to the census were deviated from, so far as to include the absent,niem- 
bers of the several families.

ly years, the population has rapidly increased, although at various 
times considerable numbers have emigrated to foreign lands. 
Within that period, -the country has frequently been visited with 
scarcity ; but it was so at four different times to such a degree of 
severity, as to call forth public sympathy and aid. T.he general 
scarcity of Blidclhna na peasrach, or the pease-meal year of 
1782, is not yet forgotten. In the same manner, the hardships of 
want were severely felt in the years 1807 and 1817; but the dis- 
tress of those seasons was trifling in comparison with that of 1836 
and 1837, which will ever be memorable in the annals of this and 
other parishes. 

It is impossible by any description to give an adequate idea of 
the calamities of the late destitution. The spring of 1835 was 
cold and inclement. Sowing was of necessity late, and, owing to 
the moist state of the soil, a large portion of the seed never vege- 
tated. Potatoes were planted, but, from an unaccountable disease 
in that prolific and alimentary root, as well as from the coldness 
of the soil, the greater part decayed in the ground. In harvest 
the unripe fields were deluged with rain. The straw lost its sub- 
stance. The grain remained unfilled, and the hopes of the hus- 
bandman for the support of his family and cattle were simulta- 
neously blasted. For the spring of 1836 the people were ill pre- 
pared. Their oats were damaged and scanty. Their potatoes 
were few, and of the worst quality. The fields were with difficul- 
ty tilled for the reception of seed, which gave but feeble hopes of 
vegetation. In many places, tracts of lands were cultivated which 
remained unsown. The cattle became emaciated on the sapless 
straw. The season advanced with every appearance of fearful re- 
sults. The natives, so justly characterized by their sense of pride 
and patience under the hardships of indigence, were forced to ac- 
knowledge their want of the necessaries of life. Already the re- 
sidence of the clergyman was daily frequented by groups of the 
helpless, as if he could procure immediate relief. The shores 
were ransacked late and early, and at all hours, for sea-weed and 
shell-fish, to afford a scanty repast. The fields were of unpro- 
mising appearance, and, before they arrived at any thing like ma- 
turity, October came in, with its piercing frost, and destructive 
storm of snow. Sad and distressing were the scenes of hardship

and crofters, lotters and land-occupiers of every grade, were si- 
multaneously overwhelmed in the general calamity. The atten- 
tion of gentlemen, both clerical and lay, was speedily aroused. 
The clergy who were located in the regions of distress, and were 
eye-witnesses to scenes of hardship which they can never forget, 
lost no time in framing and forwarding representations of the ca- 
lamity to all and sundry in the kingdom, who, they supposed, 
could afford relief. The British capital was visited by a deputa- 
tion of gentlemen, who relinquished for a time their Several avo- 
cations, and, with minds teeming with philanthropy, aroused the 
sympathies, and the noblest feehno-s of the English nation, by ap- 
peals adorned alike with eloquence and truth. Those appeals the 
benevolent English could not resist, and the amount of liberality 
displayed on that occasion surpasses all admiration and praise. 

The primary cause of the late destitution was a redundancy 
of population, occasioned by an injudicious system of manage- 
ment. The error of the system of management lay in the 
frequency of early and improvident marriages, encouraged by the 
introduction of the lotting system, which, in its turn, gave rise to 
bad husbandry. These several causes operated on each other with 
mutual influence, and acted in concert against the prosperity of 
the inhabitants. The amount of population was rapidly increas- 
ing, while the amount of the means of support for each family was, 
in the same ratio, diminishing. Poverty was speedily making in- 
roads among the people, and the seeds of wretchedness at a future 
period were rapidly growing up. The natives, however, might 
have for years borne up under the pressure and influence of these 
unfavourable circumstances, had not other external causes come to 
operate in unison with those just mentioned, to reduce them with 
accelerated speed, to poverty. These other causes were the fall 
in the price of cattle, — the failure of herring-fisheries, — the cessa- 
tion of kelp manufacture, — and the want of remunerating employ- 

 The writer of this Account cannot omit to notice, that, by the indefatigable ex- 
ertions in this cause of the Rev. Norman Macleod, D. D. of St Coluniba's, Glasgow, 
and John Bowie, Esq., W. S., Edinburgh, — these gentlemen have won themselves 
a title to lasting h onour. They not only exerted themselves with devoted industry 
to procure relief for the distressed in the years of scarcity already referred to. but 
they still exert themselves, in their different spheres, to get the Highlanders esta- 
blished on such a footing as to prevent under Providence the recurrence of similar 
destitution. A reduction of the overgrown amount of population is the only reme- 
dy for this desirable end. The people themselves are sensible of it ; and the gentle- 
men just mentioned are so sensible of it, that they are even now using tiicir utmost 
endeavours to obtain a boon so loudly called for.

ment. The only preventive remedy is to reduce the population by 
a Government system of emigration. 

The proprietor and managers of this estate, fully sensible of 
the truth of these statements, have already made a bold stand to 
arrest the progress of the evils complained of. The subdivision 
of lots and crofts has be;n prevented. The possessor of a few 
acres of land is not permitted, as formerly, to cut them up in 
shreds and patches, to afford a new and separate dwelling for each 
of his sons and daughters who resolve to get married. The yearly 
average of marriages is therefore not one-fourth of what it was 
some years ago. Measures are therefore prudently adopted to en- 
large the possessions of the tenant, by adding the lands of such as 
emigrate to the adjoining allotments. Even this year 1840, a 
good deal has been accomplished in this way, as about 700 souls 
have emigrated to America from this and the adjoining parishes, 
by means of assistance which was benevolently afforded them by 
the Noble proprietor and the Edinburgh Destitution Committee. 
But much remains to be yet effected, were Government to see the 
propriety of removing the redundant population, so as to give am- 
ple scope to the working of the salutary system now introduced. 

Character of the People. — The character of the people is great- 
ly influenced by the effects of a redundancy of their number. 
These effects, however are so obvious, that- they need not here be 
specified. 

Notwithstanding the many unfavourable circumstances under 
which the natives are placed, they are peaceable, orderly, and dis- 
tinguished for general good conduct. In no place can a popula- 
tion be found more hospitably inclined in their own humble way, 
or more kind and attentive to strangers. They are naturally 
shrewd and sensible, and possess considerable aculeness and viva- 
city of intellect. They are certainly a temperate people, and taint- 
ed with few vices. 

 The language both spoken and preached is the Gaelic. The 
higher orders, of course, speak English, and most of the young 
men partially understand it. Although the Gaelic has perhaps lost 
no ground for half a century back, yet it has suffered materially in 
purity. As the young men resort annually to the south country 
in quest of employment, they invariably acquire a smattering of 
English, many words of which, they unfortunately intermix, by a 
sort of pride, with their own emphatic and venerable language. 

The Highland dress is now worn by none in the parish. Owing

to the excess and poverty of the population, and the high price of 
wool, the natives, notwithstanding their exertions and industry, are 
generally but scantily supplied with bed-clothes and wearing ap- 
parel. The females, for the most part, weave the country cloths 
of all kinds, and are very expert in dyeing all colours to much per- 
fection. The country people tan their own leather, sometimes 
with the bark of the birch tree, but for the most part with the 
roots of the Tormentilla vulgaris. They generally make their 
own shoes or brogues, which they finish very neatly with no sort 
of hempen thread, but with a thong cut from the dressed hide of 
a calf. 

Superstitions. — The age of superstition may be said to be now 
gone, as the vestiges which remain of it are but comparatively 
few, and have but little influence over the minds of the greater 
portion of the natives. At one period, however, the case was 
otherwise, when the existence of second-sight, and of other super- 
natural phenomena, was as firmly believed in the Hebrides, as the 
writings of the Apostle Paul. On this subject there have been 
many arguments, and keen discussions among the learned, and 
much has been written on both sides of the question. 

The person who had the misfortune to be gifted with the second- 
sight was called Taibhsear, or seer. He was considered by him- 
self and others to be unhappily gifted, and on that account no one 
envied him for his unnatural attainments. The visions were ge- 
nerally about shrouds, funerals, corpses, the appearance of friends 
or others, who were at the time in distant countries, — the arrival 
of strangers, swamping of boats, drowning at sea, dropping sud- 
denly dead, and numberless other subjects. 

The faculty which a taibhsear was said to possess had a strik- 
ing resemblance to the clairvoyance of the animal raagnetists. 
Many astonishing cases might be mentioned of taibhsearachd, or 
second-sight, wherein it would appear impossible that either fraud 
or deception could exist. It may, however, be naturally asked, 
if the gift was at one time so common, and if so many were, with 
so much certainty, possessed of it, why it has wholly disappeared 
from those very localities in which it was once so prevalent Martin, 
in his book on the Hebrides, alludes to many even in this parish 
who were, according to him, undoubted taibhsears; but although 
we have now four individuals in the place, for every one individual 
in his day, we would look in vain among the whole population for 
a single taibhsear.

Dr Beattie ascribes the pretended faculty to the influence of 
physical causes on superstitious and unenlightened minds. He 
endeavours to trace it to the effects which wild scenery, inter- 
spersed with valleys, mountains, and lakes, has upon the imagi- 
nation of the natives. But were this the case, second-sight would 
still exist, as the rocks, valleys, and mountain-scenery still exist 
as wild and fantastic as ever, to affect the imagination of the 
people. Others maintain that second-sight arose from optical il- 
lusions, and others from ignorance, the great mother of all super- 
stitions. It is remarkable, when Dr Samuel Johnson visited this 
Island in 1773, and heard a variety of plausible instances of the 
prophetic powers of the second-sight, that he gave credit to it, 
and expressed his surprise that it was disbelieved by the clergy, 
while all others were inclined to believe in its existence and truth. 

Somewhat analogous to the pretended faculty just described, 
yet different from it, are certain prognostications of death, which 
are seen in the shape of blue quivering lights, resembling the fee- 
ble flame of a taper. These have been observed moving along in 
the course which some funeral procession would soon thereafter 
take, or perhaps twinkling in or about the bed in which some in- 
dividual was soon to die. Of the existence of such lights, what- 
ever their cause, no shade of doubt can be entertained, as they 
have been frequently seen by several individuals at the same time, 
whose minds were tinctured neither by prejudice nor by the reve- 
ries of any superstition. 

Some time ago the natives firmly believed in the existence of 
the " Gruagach," a female spectre of the class of Brownies, to 
whom the dairy-maids made frequent libations of milk. The 
" Gruagach" was said to be an innocent supernatural visitor, who 
frisked and gambolled about the pens and folds. She was armed 
only with a pliable reed, with which she switched any who would 
annoy her, either by uttering obscene language or by neglecting 
to leave for her a share of the dairy production. Even so late as 
1770, the dairy-maids who attended a herd of cattle in the Island 
of Trodda, were in the habit of pouring daily a quantity of milk 
on a hollow stone for the " Gruagach." Should they neglect to

do SO, they were sure of feeling the effects of Miss Brownie's 
wand next day. It is said that the Rev. Donald Macqueen, then 
minister of this parish, went purposely to Trodda to check that 
gross superstition. He might then have succeeded for a time in 
doing so, but it is known that many believed in the Gruagach's ex- 
istence, long after that Reverend gentleman's death. 

Besides the votaries of this ridiculous superstition, there are 
others who confidently believe in the existence of a malignant 
look, or evil eye, by which cattle and all kinds of property are said 
to suffer injury. The glance of an evil eye is consequently very 
much dreaded. No doubts are entertained that it deprives cows 
of their milk, and milk of its nutritive qualities, so as to render it 
unfit for the various preparations made from it. This supersti- 
tion can certainly lay claim to great antiquity.

Immense tracts of waste ground are found in the place, which 
might be brought into cultivation by a proper system of manage- 
ment, at comparatively small expense. By means of trenching, and 
the application of lime, the agricultural value of the parish might 
be greatly enhanced.

Live-Stoch — The common breeds of sheep are the black- faced 
and Cheviot on principal tacks, and the small Highland kind on 
the possessions of the crofter. The Highland breed of cattle is 
universally reared, with the exception of a few Ayrshire cows, which 
some tacksmen keep for their milk. As the latter require more 
provender, and are but little in demand at market, they are sel- 
dom reared. The breeds of sheep and cattle have of late years 
been greatly improved, by purchasing at high prices superior tups 
and bulls. Small tenants seldom rear bulls for their own little 
stock, but are supplied with the same from the tacksmen's stocks, 
which tends greatly to improve the general breed of the parish. 
The indigenous Highland breed are known over all the kingdom 
for their symmetry and hardiness, and, though generally small in 
size, they fetch higher prices at market, than cattle of inferior 
breed, though of greater weight. The sheep on large farms are 
regularly smeared every season with butter and tar. This process 
seems indispensable for rendering the stock healthy, and for de- 
fending them against the effects of a wet and boisterous climate. 

Husbandrtj.—lt must be acknowledged, that, with the excep- 
tion of large farms, the state of husbandry is still very unimprov- 
ed. The tillage is conducted in a slovenly and unprofitable man- 
ner, and no encouragement can possibly effect any material im- 
provement, while the place remains burdened with a redundant 
and helpless population. The lotting system has proved ruinous 
to the country, in so far as it has been the means of increasing the 



278 



INVEllNESS-SIIIRE. 



population, without making any provision adequate for their sup- 
port. The proprietor, with humane intentions, divided the vari- 
ous hamlets into lots and crofts of small extent, for the purpose of 
supplying each family with less or more possessions. But this is 
not all; the people themselves having once seen the system in- 
troduced, went on for years dividing and subdividing their small al- 
lotments, that they might share them in trifling patches with their 
sons and daughters, who, by these means, branched out into sepa- 
rate families, built separate dwellings, and thus multiplied with 
amazing rapidity. Farms, in this manner cut up and mutilated, 
cannot possibly yield what will pay the rents and support their oc- 
cupiers. To effect both these ends, there is an annual efflux of 
men and women to the south country in quest of employment, 
which is but a toilsome resource, attended with no real benefit. 
The lands are consequently left to the management of the aged 
and infirm, and to children who cannot be expected to effect any 
improvements, even were the system acted on more adapted than 
it is for that purpose. 

Besides the families just mentioned, who occupy distinct por- 
tions of land by subset or otherwise, there is a vast number of poor 
cottars, who have no lands, but live directly or indirectly on those 
who have. The means to which they resort for this purpose are, 
to obtain patches of ground from their neighbours for raising po- 
tatoes and a little corn, on what is called " Leth-coise," or the 
half-foot system. By this system the farmer or crofter gives 
only the ground, and one-half of the seed to the cottar, who tills 
it, and manures it if necessary with sea-ware,  Alga marina, then 
supplies the other half of the seed, and returns the one-half of the 
whole produce in harvest to the land occupier, as a compensation 
for the use of the ground. 

Another great bar in the way of improvements, is the want of 
horses and ploughs to till the ground. The divisions of land are 
in general so small, that most of the tenants are unable to main- 
tain even one horse. The crofter, therefore, must till his posses- 
sions with his own hands f The instrument which he uses for this 
purpose is the " cas-chrom" or crooked-spade. This primitive 
kind of utensil resembles the stilt of a plough, with a straight piece 
of wood attached to the lower end of it, forming an obtuse angle, 
and having a socket of iron called the " ceap," on the part whicli 
enters the ground. The stilt is held with both hands, and the 
lower part or sole is driven into the ground by means of a peg,

279 



on which the right foot rests and presses. When the ground is thus 
turned over and sown, the harrowing department generally falls to 
the lot of the women. Owing to the lightness of the harrow, 
which they are able to drag after them, the ground cannot be made 
sufficiently smooth, and to remedy this, they commence anew with 
the " racan," which is a block of wood having a few teeth in it, 
with a handle about three feet in length. As they have few or 
no carts, they are under the necessity of carrying manure, peats, 
potatoes, and all such commodities in creels upon their backs. 
So little do the women care for the weight of the creel, though 
full of peats or potatoes on their backs, that, while walking with 
it, they are engaged either at spinning on the distaff, or knitting 
stockings. Sacks, or canvas bags, are seldom used ; instead of 
which they have bags which they call " plats," made of beautiful- 
ly plaited bulrushes. Of the same useful material they likewise 
make their ropes, and sometimes cables for their boats. 

Although the agricultural processes of the small tenants are in 
this manner conducted, the tacksmen are possessed of ploughs and 
carts, and other implements of husbandry, of the best and most 
approved modern construction. 

Improvements. — The only improvement of consequence which 
has been accomplished in the parish in the way of agriculture, is 
the draining of Loch-Colum-Cille, formerly alluded to. This 
important undertaking, which was the work of several years, and 
incurred some thousand pounds of expense, has been effectual- 
ly executed, and thereby a surface of about 230 acres has been 
reclaimed, of the finest alluvial soil imaginable. A considerable 
portion of it is annually cultivated, and the remainder yields an 
abundant crop of natural grasses, which is profitably cut down by 
the scythe. The process of draining this sheet of water was 
conducted in a manner different from the former attempts for that 
purpose ; and in one place the main trench which leads from the 
lake to the sea, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile, is 35 
feet deep, 114 feet wide at top, and sloping gradually on each 
side, at an angle of 33° 40', to a wideness of nine feet at bottom. 

Leases of lands are principally confined to tacksmen and exten- 
sive graziers. Should the possessions of the crofters be somewhat 
enlarged, as is intended to be done with gradual advances, leases 
will, no doubt, be granted, and every encouragement for improve- 
ments allowed. The proprietor and his managers are fully sensi- 
ble of the unhappy effects of the lotting-system, and even now.

they avail themselves of every opportunity to remedy the evil, by 
encouraging emigration, and by enlarging such allotments of land, 
as are known to be too small, guarding, however, against all harsh 
and inhumane measures for the attainment of the end in view. 

Produce. — The following is the average gross amount of raw 
produce raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained : 

Grain with fodder, 1618 bolls, at L.l, . L.1618 0 0

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market-town : the nearest is Portree, distant twenty- 
four miles. A considerable portion of the parish has not the advan- 
tage of a road. Along the south-east boundary of Kilmuir, a road 
of about nine miles in length was formed, ten years ago, to the dis- 
trict of Steinscholl. As yet, however, it passes through but a 
small portion of that district. To this most important means of 
communication, a little is annually added by statute labour, and it 
is anticipated that in a few years the three districts composing the 
parish will be supplied ■ivith roads. 

The nearest post-town is Portree. There is, however, a re- 
ceiving-house, or sub-post-ofl6ce at a place in Kilmuir district, 
which is about two miles from its southern boundary, and about 
twenty-one from Portree, whence a runner comes three times a- 
week. The letters are conveyed to Kilmaluag and Steinscholl dis- 
tricts by a private runner. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built in 1810, and 
affords accommodation for about 700 sitters. It is a rectangular 
building, with a door on each end, the pulpit on the one side, and 
a heptagonal gallery, with only one wooden stair leading to it. It 
has no belfry, bell, or vestry, the want of which is much felt. 
The site of the church is in Kilmuir district, about four miles from 
the one extremity, and two from the other. It is in good repair, 
and all the sittings are free. As Kilmaluag district is somewhat 
remote from the church, the clergyman performs divine service 
there every fourth Sabbath. 

The manse was built in the year 1778, and is distant about a 
mile and a quarter from the church. It was the first manse built in 
the Island. The stipend is L. 150 Sterling, and the Crown is pa-

roil. The glebe consists of 35 acres, including both pasture and 
arable grounds, and its value may be computed at L. 10 Sterling. 

The church-yard, in which the parish church formerly stood, 
is quite contiguous to the manse. It was enclosed eight years ago 
with a wall of stone and lime, but, previous to that time, it had no 
fence whatever. It contains but few tomb-stones or monuments 
of any kind. In favourable weather, the church is generally well 
attended, particularly in the winter season, when the parishioners 
are all at home. The number of communicants, male and female, 
is about 90. Owing to the poverty of the people, the yearly ave- 
rage of church collections hardly amounts to L.3 Sterling. 

The Government church of SteinschoU is situated near the old 
burying -ground of Kilmartin. It has as yet no gallery. The 
manse is near the church. . The district of SteinschoU was eccle- 
siastically set apart from the rest of the parish by the presbytery, 
who fixed its boundaries, and added to it a small pendicle of Sni- 
zort. 

Education, — The total number of schools at present is three; 
ist, the parochial sohool, salary, L.oO Sterling, with house and 
garden; '2d One from the Society in Scotland for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge, salary, L.15 Sterling, with house and piece 
of land ; 3d, One from the Gaelic School Society. The proprie- 
tor gave the necessary accommodations at SteinschoU for a school 
from the excellent scheme of the General Assembly, and a teacher 
was placed there for the last ten j'ears, until lately withdrawn, un- 
der the expectation that the station will soon be supplied with a 
parochial school, under the Highland School Act. 

In the parochial school the following branches are taught : 
reading English and Gaelic, English in all its departments, arith- 
metic, mathematics, geography, navigation, Latin, and Greek. In 
the school from the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christ- 
ian Knowledge, the common branches of education are taught ; 
while the Gaelic school, by its regulations, is confined exclusively 
to the teaching of Gaelic. 

In the parochial school, the average number of scholars in sum- 
mer is 70, and in winter, 130. The attendance is very irregular, 
on account oi' the inability of the parents to clothe them and to 
purchase books ; and, besides this, the services of the children are 
required at home, when their fathers and grown-up brothers leave 
the country in quest of work. 

The children in general are instructed first in the English lan-

guage. The reason for this is, because, \st, The imitative powers 
of children, with respect to sounds and articulation, are more acute 
in early life than in maturer years ; and were the Gaelic taught 
first, it would be almost impossible to adapt the tone of the voice 
afterwards to English pronunciation ; "idli/, Although the English 
may take a longer period than the Gaelic to acquire it properly, 
yet, when it is acquired, the pupils can master the Gaelic without 
any assistance ; and 3dly, Such as cannot speak the English, 
naturally are more reluctant to leave the country in quest of that 
employment which they cannot procure at home. 

The fees in all the schools are merely nominal, on account of 
the poverty of the people. There are many in the parish who 
have no education whatever. These, for the most part, are old 
people, who had no opportunities of acquiring instruction in their 
younger days, and women of all ages. Many of the people foolish- 
ly imagine, that their girls have but little need of education in 
comparison with their boys, and consequently the proportion of the 
former who attend school is comparatively small. 

Poor Funds. — The number of persons who receive parochial aid is 
about 60, who are divided into classes according to their respective 
degrees of poverty. Owing to the smallness of the sum realized by 
church collections, the funds are divided only once in two years. 
There is no other fund for the benefit of the poor ; it may, there- 
fore, be said, that they are almost entirely supported by going 
about from place to place in quest of public charity. 

Imis,- — The number of small inns in the parish is 3, one in each 
district. Owing to the depression of the times, the people, should 
they be inclined, cannot afford to drink to any excess. 

Fuel. — The only fuel of the parish is peat, with which the na- 
tives supply themselves generally from the hills. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking variation which has taken place since the 
publishing of the last Statistical Account, is the immense increase 
of population, from the causes already explained. Since then, 
too, the natural resources of lucrative employment for the natives 
have undergone a complete revolution. By means of legislative 
enactments, and certain alterations in the commercial policy of the 
nation, which led to the reduction of duty on salt and barilla, the 
kelp trade has been annihilated. This has proved an incalculable 
loss to both proprietor and tenant. The quantity of sea-ware 
which was necessary for producing a ton of kelp, which was dis-

posed of at one time for L.16 Sterling and upwards, is now sold as 
manure for the ground at nearly as many shillings  Within the 
period of time mentioned, the prices of cattle have likewise been 
fluctuating. During the peninsular war exorbitant prices were 
asked and obtained, and the rents of land were in consequence fixed 
at a higher rate than formerly, which the tenants found it no difficult 
matter at that time to pay. Then came the failure of the herring- 
fisheries, as if to crown the misfortunes of the once prosperous 
Hebridean. In this manner, within the compass of a few years, 
the different sources from which the natives derived lucrative em- 
ployments almost entirely failed. 

Relics of ancient customs Sfc. — At a remote period, before the 
introduction of water-mills, the Miiileann-brddha or quern was in 
constant use in the parish for grinding grain. The muileann- 
bradha consisted of two circular stones, about 26 inches diameter, 
the lower one of which was generally fixed in a frame of wood, 
raised breast-high. The upper stone was so fitted and balanced. 
as to revolve with ease on the lower one, when impelled with a 
peg fastened in it to turn it round. It therefore resembled a wa- 
ter-mill in miniature. Grinding with the muileann-bradha was 
always left to the females, two of whom were engaged at it at the 
same time, — the one feeding it with grain, the other causing the 
stone to revolve, — and both uniting in chaunting a mountain me- 
lody, corresponding in time with the working of the machine. 
There is only one inuileann-bradha now in the whole parish, which, 
though not required for use, seems to have been preserved as a relic 
of olden times. In the Island of Harris querns are still quite com- 
mon, and a great part of the grain raised there is ground by them. 
This primitive kind of mill was at one period in general use over 
all the Highlands of Scotland, and is still said to exist among the 
northern nations of Europe, and in parts of Asia. Dr Clarke and 
other travellers have seen querns in Palestine, and there is every 
reason to suppose that they were early in use among the Jews. 

An ancient custom prevailed among the Gael, from time imme- 
morial, of parching corn. It was in existence'in this parish, until very 

• Scottish legislators endeavoured at various periods to discourage the use of the 
muileann-bradha, but for what purpose is not exactly known. In the reign of Alex- 
ander III. and in the year 1284, it was enacted, " That na man shall presuni to 
grinde quheit, maisloch, or rye, with hand-mylnes, except he be compelled by storm, 
and be in lack of mylncs quhilk should grinde the samen. And in this case, if a man 
grindcs at hand-mylnes, he shall gif the threttein measure as multer ; and if any man 
contraveins this our prohibilion, he shall tyne his hand-mylnes perpetuallie."

lately, and elven as yet it is practised in some rare instances. It 
■ is executed as follows : A female makes choice of some convenient 
station out of doors, if possible, where a flat stone of considerable 
surface can be obtained. To this place she carries some stocks 
of corn, for the purpose of parching the grain, and preparing it 
for grinding. She connnences by taking up in her left hand part 
of a sheaf; then, setting the ears on fire, they are allowed to burn 
until the grain, thus dried and extricated from -the stalks, fall on 
the flat stone or pavement underneath. In her other hand she 
has a stick, with which she keeps constantly beating at the blazing 
straw, to shake off the grain which does not fall when the husks 
are consumed. When all the sheaves are in this manner exposed 
to the flames, the grain is collected, and fanned, and thus made 
ready for the mill. This process is called gradan, and the meal 
prepared by it makes wholesome and palatable bread. By these 
simple means, corn has been frequently shorn, dried, dressed, 
ground, baked, and eaten, in less time than an hour. About 
twelve or fifteen years ago, a person, by going in a calm winter 
morning to some little eminence, might at one glance observe 
fires blazing, and columns of smoke rising aloft in various hamlets 
at the same time, in each of which the parching process was going 
on. This practice, as may be understood, is attended with a great 
loss of straw, which is, to all appearance, the cause of its being al- 
most entirely discontinued. The natives, however, from their 
fondness of meal thus prepared, have since come to practise more 
generally another ancient method of drying corn, by which meal, 
similar in quality with that of the gradan, is produced, and all the 
straw saved. This method is called uirearadh. A large fire is pre- 
pared, in the centre of which is placed the most capacious pot in 
the dwelling. A considerable quantity of grain is put into it, and 
a female, with a broad piece of wood, is in attendance, who con- 
stantly stirs the grain to prevent it from burning by the heated 
metal. In a few minutes it becomes sufficiently parched, when it 
is taken out, and another supply put in its place, and so on, until 
the whole quantity of grain intended to be converted into meal is 
similarly treated. 

There is every reason to suppose that the parched corn men- 
tioned in the sacrecl Scriptures was prepared in some manner si- 
milar to the Celtic customs just described. 

Old men manufacture snuff from common twist tobacco, by a 
process which they also call gradan. They untwist the leaf, dry

it by the tire, and grind it in the bottom of a common bottle. 
The snuff thus prepared resembles what is called Lundifoot, and 
is preferred by the natives in general, particularly by old men, to 
regularly manuf;xctured snufT. 

The women, for the most part, thrash the corn by a light flail 
of peculiar but simple construction. The quantity of barley raised 
is but very small, which the natives seldom reap with a sickle, but 
when ripe they pull it from the roots, then equalize it, and tie it 
up in small bunches. When it becomes seasoned, they cut off 
the ears with a knife, and preserve the straw for thatching their 
dwellings. 

Until within the last few years, no eggs were bought or sold in 
the parish ; but now the case is quite otherwise. There are several 
females in the place, who daily go about for eggs, or are ready to 
receive them when sent to their habitations. The price given is 
3d. per dozen, which is generally paid by little articles of grocery 
goods, with which the egg-wives are always supplied for the ac- 
commodation of their customers. Those who deal in this frangible 
commodity, send the same in boxes by the steam-boat to the 
Glasgow market. 

Kilmuir was formerly famous for its pipers : but they are now 
extinct. The leading performers and teachers of this ancient and 
martial music, were the MacArthurs. When the proprietors 
resided in the parish, a free grant of the lands of Peingowen, a 
hamlet in the place, was given to the MacArthurs, in the same 
manner as Boreraig was given by the Macleods of Dunvegan, to 
the MacCrimmons. Peingowen, like Boreraig, was a sort of mu- 
sical college, to which pupils were sent by various chieftains, to 
acquire a correct knowledge of pidbaireachd. A little green hill 
in close vicinity to Piengowen, called Cnoc-phail, was the genei-al 
rendezvous of the MacArthurs and their pupils. To the top of 
this eminence, they almost daily resorted, and practised their 
tunes. The MacArthurs vied with the MacCrimmons of Dunve- 
gan, the MacGregors of Fortingall, the Mackays of Gairloch, 
the Rankins of Coll, and the Maclntyres of Rannoch, who were 
all renowned performers in their day. 

Some years ago every funeral procession was attended by one 
or more pipers, who always played a lament, or melancholy pio- 
bairreachd, suitable for the occasion. The attendants silently 
listened to the quivering notes of the bagpipe, as they rent the 
atmosphere, and re-echoed from the surrounding hills. The in-

habitants in the remote parts of the district were also warned by 
these doleful and protracted peals, floating on the air, that a fel- 
low-creature was about to be consigned to his kindred dust. 

A barbarous custom prevailed at funerals, of drinking whisky 
in the burying-ground immediately after the interment. This in- 
decent behaviour was, at one time, carried to a shameful excess, 
causing even broils and squabbles. Although the practice is not yet 
entirely extinct, yet, by means of the united endeavours of the 
clergy to root it out, and the example of respectable families, it 
is greatly on the decline, and when it does take place, it is carried 
to no excess. 

Perhaps the most interesting custom which prevails in the pa- 
rish is the manner of fulling, or waulking cloths, which is always 
performed by females in the following way : There is a long 
frame of wood, made for the purpose, longitudinally ribbed or 
furrowed, and in some places composed of wattled- work. On each 
side of this frame, nine, ten, or twelve young women place them- 
.selves at equal distances, and in a kneeling posture. The piece 
of cloth is then placed on the frame at its whole length, or per- 
haps doubled. This done, all the females commence work, by 
firmly rubbing it against the frame, giving it, at the same time, a 
circular motion, that all parts of it may share equally in the fric- 
tion. The whole work is enhvened by the united efforts of all in 
singing an dran-luaidh, or rustic song, corresponding in time to 
the quick movements of their hands. The work goes on so re- 
gularly, and the various voices are blended together in such com- 
plete imison and harmony, that a stranger would be highly de- 
lighted with the scene. In the same manner also, the natives 
sing when rowing a boat, or in harvest, while reaping their fields. 
It is rather surprizing how nature inspires them with such skill in 
the modulation of their rustic strains, that their music often ap- 
pears as if composed by connoisseurs in the science. They ob- 
serve flats and sharps with much precision, and also not unfre- 
quently change their tunes from major to minor keys, and vice 
versa. 

An ancient custom still prevails, of marrying in no season of 
the year except in winter. Summer is consequently not the fa- 
vourite season of Hymen. 

Most names and surnames, which are common in other Higli- 
land districts, are found here. When the natives have cause, in 
course of conversation, to speak of a neighbour, they hardly ever

tlesignate him by his surname, but by his genealogy, perhaps four 
or five generations back, and many of them can trace them much 
farther. Such names, therefore, are frequently heard, as Aonghas 
mac Alasdair, mhic Raonuill, mhic Uistein, mhic ChoUa ; Angus, 
the son of Alexander, the son of Ranold, the son of Hugh, the 
son of Coll. In the same manner, when speaking of the High- 
land chiefs, they designate them patron imically ; as, Lord. Mac- 
Donald, MacDhonuill ; Rasay, MacGhille Chaluim ; Glengarry, 
Mac mhic Alasdair ; Glenmoriston, Mac mhic Phatric ; Argyle, 
Mac Chailein Mhoir, &amp;c.

PRESBYTERY OF SKYE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. RODERICK MACLEOD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish, which is of an irregular 
form, is about 14 miles long, and from 6 to 10 broad. It is 
bounded on the south, by the parish of Portree; on the south-west 
and west, by the parishes of Bracadale and Duirinish, and Loch Sni- 
zort, an arm of the sea ; on the north by the parish of Kilmuir ; 
and on the east, by that of Steinscholl, and the channel which di- 
vides Skye from Rasay. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its surface is diversified by flat 
hills, clothed with heath and green pastures, and is intersect- 
ed by narrow valleys or glens, through which small streams or 
rivulets wind their course to the sea. Most of the hills are not 
remarkable for their elevation. In the south-east part of the pa- 
rish is a huge and lofty mountain ridge, called the Storr, which 
is one of the most interesting formations of nature in the whole 
island. The isolated peak of Storr, projecting to an immense 
height from the bosom of the adjacent hill, is seen from afar, and 
its ragged irregular outline cannot fail to attract the traveller's 
notice at a distance of many miles. Towards the east, the Storr 
presents a range of rugged cliffs, broken into irregular formations, 

• Drawn up by Mr Donald Fraser, Tarish Schoolmaster of Kilmuir, Skyc. 



288 



INVEIINESS-SHIRE. 



and rising to the height of several hundred feet. The various re- 
cesses and projections of this remarkable place render it, from 
whatever point it is viewed, a scene highly grand and picturesque. 
While a fog happens to sweep the bosom of Storr, appearances 
like those of lofty spires, walls, and turrets are seen emerging 
in majestic forms from the driving mists. 

The valleys or glens, of which there are three, Glenhaltin, 
Glenhinistil, and Glen Uigg, besides abounding with excellent 
pastures, on which a vast number of sheep and cattle are reared, 
contain large tracts of arable land. The last of these strongly 
suggests the idea of its having been formerly a lake, the waters of 
which escaped by wearing a channel to themselves, and left the 
bottom dry. 

The shore is bold and rocky, except at the heads of the lochs 
or bays, where it is low and sandy. From Loch Snizort, which 
partly intersects the parish, a number of small bays or lochs branch 
off in every direction. Of these the bay of Uigg deserves parti- 
cular attention. It is a circular basin, opening to the west, and 
is upwards of a mile and a half in circumference. About five or 
six hundred yards from the edge of the water, the ground, rising 
with steep ascent, extends in the form of a semicircle round the 
head of it, and encloses a level space of more than two hundred 
acres of arable land of the finest description. This may be said 
to be one of the most interesting places in Skye. Within the 
area of this natural amphitheatre, more than six hundred people 
live together as in a hamlet. 

Climate. — The parish partaking of an insular situation, its sum- 
mers are cooler and its winters less severe than in inland situations 
of the same latitude. Snow seldom remains longer than a few days 
on the ground near the shore. The sky is generally clouded, and 
overcast with vapours wafted from the bosom of the Atlantic 
Ocean, and these descend in such constant rains, as to interrupt 
the labours of the husbandman. The soil is naturally cold and 
moist. In seasons uncommonly wet sowing is late, and the 
progress of the crop to maturity is retarded ; and a late 
season is generally attended with the evils of scarcity, and 
even with famine. The most prevalent winds are the west and 
the south-west. The east and north-east winds are distin- 
guished by their dryness. From the moist state of the climate, 
the people are subject to inflammatory complaints, diseased action 



ISLAND OF SKYE SNIZORT. 



289 



of the lyniphatic system, and rheumatism. Fevers, and other 
diseases, occasioned by the want of cleanliness, are also frequent. 

Hydrography. — The only arm of the sea which intersects the 
parish is Loch Snizort. It is nine or ten miles long, running in a 
direction nearly south-east, and narrow and shallow. Springs 
are abundant, and their waters are of an excellent quality, clear, 
light, and salubrious. The rivers, of which there are seven, hav- 
ing not far to descend to the sea, are necessarily small, and their 
rocky channels are often nearly dry; but in rainy weather, when 
swelled by the mountain torrents, they flow with great impetuosity. 

There is on the east side of this parish a beautiful fall of water, 
the perpendicular height of which may be about 90 feet. The 
most remarkable circumstance regarding this fall is, that, nearly 
opposite to the middle of it, there is an overarched path across the 
rock, along which five or six persons may walk abreast with the 
greatest safety. The traveller when he gains this position sees 
the body of water roll over, and might take it for a pillar of 
smoke, did he not see it dash on the rocks below. 

II. — Civil History. 

Eminent Characters. — The most remarkable character connect- 
ed with this parish is Flora Macdonald, a name which will ever be 
recorded as an ornament to her sex, for the fortitude and heroism 
which she displayed in favouring the escape of Prince Charles 
Stuart, after the memorable battle of Culloden. She was the 
daughter of Macdonald of Milton, in South Uist, of which island 
she was a native. 

Land-owners. — There are five land-owners in the parish; the 
principal one is Lord Macdonald. 

Antiquities. — On the farm of Peinduin, on a rock near the 
shore, may be seen the remains of a castle, which, it would appear, 
had never been wholly finished. This castle was built a little af- 
ter the middle of the sixteenth century, by a bold and powerful 
character named Huistean Mac Ghilleaspuig Chleirich,  id est  
Hugh, son of Archibald, the clerk. He was called Cleireach, or 
clerk, on account of his being able to write, which was a rare ac- 
complishment at that time. Although Huistean was nearly relat- 
ed to the Macdonald family, he never was on good terms with 
them. Confiding much in his own strength and military prowess, 
he entertained the bold design of cutting off his chief, and of seiz- 
ing by force upon his estate. With this view he commenced the 
building of the stronghold already mentioned, and not supplying 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



t With either windows or doors, but, leaving an aperture in its roof 
to enter it by a moveable ladder, he foolishly imagined that he 
could defend himself therein from the enemy's attack, and flee to 
It as a place of safety, should he be pursued by his countrymen, 
whom he wished to reduce to absolute subjection. Soon after 
Kmg James VI. assumed the government, a bloody feud arose 
between the Macdonalds and Macleans, which became so serious 
that the King's interference was loudly called for to effect a 
reconciliation. It happened that Donald Gorm Mor of Sleat 
set out from Skye, with a retinue befitting his rank, to visit 
his kinsman, Angus Macdonald of Dunyveg, in Isla ; but, in con- 
sequence of a sudden storm which ensued, he was forced to take 
shelter in that part of Jura belonging to Maclean of Duart. At 
the same time, Huistean Mac Ghilleaspuig Chleirich and some 
attendants, with whom Donald Gorm had lately quarrelled, were 
likewise at sea, and were driven by the same storm into a neigh- 
bouring harbour in Jura. Huistean and his retinue, on finding 
that their chief lay so near them in a bay on Maclean's propert° 
secretly carried off, by night, a number of Maclean's cattle, and 
took to sea, anticipating that Donald Gorm and parly would be 
blamed for the robbery, and would suffer accordingly. Their 
wicked plot was attended with the desired success, for next day the 
Macdonalds were attacked by a superior number of armed Mac- 
leans. A bloody fray took place, in which sixty of the Skyemen 
were killed, and their chief very narrowly escaped with life. Soon 
after this, a diligent pursuit was made after Huistean. He was at 
length taken, and carried to the Castle of Duntulm, his chieftain's 
residence in Kilmuir. As he could not look for mercy from a kins- 
man against whom he had so frequently rebelled, he was cast into 
one of the dungeons at Duntulm, where he was a long time kept 
without food. At length, a quantity of salt beef, and a covered 
jug, were let down into his cell. It is said that, after partaking 
plentifully of the beef, he examined the jug, but, to his great 
mortification, found it empty, and in this manner he died of thirst. 

In a small island, formed by the River Snizort, are the ruins of 
a large cathedral, which, in all probability, was formerly the me- 
tropolitan church of Skye, but is now, with the island, used as a 
place of sepulture. 

Cairns of stones, under which, it is said, the ashes of renowned 
chieftains are deposited, and the remains of Druidical temples, 
are to be seen in many places. In the last Statistical report of 



ISLAND OF SKYE SNIZORT. 



291 



this parish, there is the following interesting account : " Ina 
cairn lately dug up, was found a large stone chest, or coffin, made 
of four stones, about 5 feet long, and 4 broad. Upon the layer, 
which is a large single stone, of nearly 6 feet by 5, and 1 foot 
thick, was found the handle of a small weapon, resembling much 
the hilt of a sword, quite corroded with rust, and a pin, which 
seemed to be compound metal, about 7 inches long, somewhat 
rounder than a pretty large probe j the one end was flat and 
broad, and the other round and sharp-pointed. Within the coffin 
was an urn of burned clay, nicely carved, but without any inscrip- 
tion. The urn being broken by the tools employed in removing 
the layer, none of its contents wer-e discovered." 

About fifty years ago, there was found in a moss dug for peats, 
on the farm of Sheader, a small box full of arms, which were not 
shaped like the modern ones, but short and broad. On one 
of them, when cleared of rust, was the name Bocchus, who is said 
to have been sheriff of Ross-shire ; for Skye at that time formed 
a part of that shire, when the Macdonald family held the Earldom 
of Ross. That which had the name Bocchus seemed to be the 
principal sword of justice, which used to be laid before the sheriff 
on the table, when holding his courts, and the other arms appeared 
to belong to inferior officers. The box and arms were given to 
Lord Alexander Macdonald, grandfather of the present Lord. 

Many of those circular duns, which the traveller meets with in 
other parts of the Highlands, are to be seen here. 

III. — Population. 

• The population in 1735, was 1627 

1794, 1808

Among the superstitions of the people, it may be noticed, that 
there is nothing so much dreaded by many as what they term an 
evil eye. As an antidote against this, the following verse is to be 
repeated by the person who dreads it, when washing in the morn- 
ing :— 

Gu beannaiclieadh Dia mo shiiil, 
'S beannaichidh mo shuil na chi : 
Beannaichidh raise mo nabidh, 
'S beannaichidh mo nabidh mi. 

Let God bless my eye, 

And my eye will bless all 1 sec ; 

I will bless my neighbour, 

And my neighbour will bless mc

The belief in llie second -.sight, which formerly prevailed here, 
as well as in other parts of the Highlands, is wearing away. Such 
as pretended to be gifted with this supernatural quality seem now 
to think their first sight is quite sufficient for all necessary and 
useful purposes, without the aid of the second ; and that the reali- 
ties of the present world give them enough to do, without troub- 
ling themselves about what is going on in the world of spirits. - 

Habits. — In cleanliness and other domestic comforts, there is 
ample room for improvement. The Highland dress is wholly- 
extinct, and their clothing now consists of kelt or tartan of their 
own manufacture. The walls of their mean huts are commonly 
built of stones, and, instead of mortar or lime, the middle is cram- 
med with earth to keep out the cold air. The interior is divided 
into two or three apartments by a thin partition of boards, or a few 
small sticks woven with straw. The apartment next the door being 
appropriated to the cattle, is much lower than the rest of the 
house, in order to give room to the dung to accumulate, which is 
seldom removed oftener than once or twice a year. Of the other 
two apartments, one is the sitting-room of the family, and the 
other both bed-room and barn ; but some have a separate place for 
thrashing their corn. The fire is placed in the middle of the floor, 
and the smoke finds its way through a hole in the roof, or by the 
door. The leading articles of furniture, which is of the humblest 
description, consist of a table of very rough workmanship, a few 
stools, two or three chairs, and an easy chair called sunnag, made 
of straw, and the sole property of the goodwife. In the more 
respectable houses, there is along the wall a bench made in the 
form of a sofa, on which half-a-dozen of people can sit. In such 
as want this convenience, there is a row of stones covered with 
turf. The door is the principal aperture for the admission of air, 
which, as the cattle enjoy the benefit of it first, cannot be of the 
purest description when it reaches the rational inmates. Light is 
admitted through a few panes of glass placed in the thatch. 

Character. — The people are kind and hospitable as far as their 
limited means permit. The stranger is always a welcome guest. 
It must, however, unwillingly be acknowledged, that they do not 
live upon terms of such sincere and cordial friendship with one 
another as they did some thirty or forty years ago. Passions 
which interrupt the peace and harmony of the neighbourhood 
prevail ; petty thefts are on the increase ; litigations are more 
frequent; and disputes, . which used to be amicably settled

throuo-h the intervention of kind friends and neighbours, are now 
brought for decision before courts of justice. For the truth of 
this statement, the great number of cases brought before the local 
courts is a sufficient proof. This depline of morals is chiefly to 
be attributed to their poverty. In consequence of the crowded 
state of the population, the tenants have sunk to the rank of lot- 
ters, having but a small portion of the land which they occupied 
when there were but few to cultivate the soil. Want is driving 
many to seek in the wilds of America for the comforts denied 
them in their native land. 

The ordinary food of the peasantry consists of oat-bread, fish, 
and potatoes, the last of which constitutes the principal part of it. 

IV. — Industry. 

Jgricidture. — From the physical quality of its surface, a great 
part of this parish must remain an uncultivated waste. Pas- 
turage forms the principal employment of a great part of the in- 
habitants. Like the Germans of Tacitus, " their pride consists 
in the number of their flocks and herds : these are their only riches, 
and in these they place their chief delight." Their cows are 
more celebrated for their fine symmetry, than for the quantity of 
milk which they yield. On the large farms, agriculture is now 
conducted on scientific principles. Carts, ploughs, and other im- 
proved implements of husbandry have been introduced, and the 
system of cropping in rotation is practised to a considerable extent. 
But on the small lots, the mode of tillage pursued is tedious and 
extremely defective. Crooked ridges, stretching in every direction, 
and separated by broad useless spaces, from which the soil has 
been scraped to enrich the arable portion, meet the eye. The 
soil is broken up by the cdschrom, and when sown is harrowed by 
women, who are also employed in carrying out the manure in 
creels to the field, and other drudgeries of the same nature. It 
cannot but give pain to every benevolent mind to see not only 
young women whose delicate frame should exempt them from 
such hard labours, but even mothers employed as beasts of bur- 
den. 

Fisheries. — There is a fishing-station at the head of Loch Sni- 
zort, where salmon are caught. Several tons of cod and ling are 
annually sent to Glasgow and Liverpool. The herring-fishing at 
one time, besides affording a plentiful supply of provisions to the 
people, formed a very lucrative article of commerce. Herrings 
were, some years ago, caught in such abundance in the yares or 
cairidhs, large circular mounds erected at the head of the bays

in shallow water, as to become a nuisance before they could be 
salted; but now they seldom visit the coast. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There is an excellent road running 
through the whole length of the parish, and affording an easy 
communication with Portree, the nearest market-town ; and there 
is a receiving-house at Uigg, to which the Harris packet comes 
once a-week for the mails. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church, which is situated at the head 
of Loch Snizort, near the southern extremity of the parish, was 
built about forty years ago. It was originally intended to accom- 
modate 450 sitters; but, from the great increase of population, 
being considered too small, it was lately enlarged by the addi- 
tion of 300 sittings ; the expense of which was defrayed by private 
subscription. The manse, which is situated near the church, was 
built at the same time, and has lately undergone repairs. The 
stipend amounts to L. 150, and the value of the glebe is about 
L. 15 a-year. The minister of the parish preaches also every 
third Sunday at Uigg, one of the most destitute localities in the 
Highlands. The Antipsedobaptists, who are the only Dissenters 
in the parish, have a meeting-house here, and have been making 
some converts ; but, from recent events, there is reason to 
believe that their progress is more rapid than lasting. There 
are not more than thirty members in full communion with their 
church. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are two other 
schools in the parish, one at Uigg, on the Assembly's scheme, 
and the other called Macdermid's Institution, from the name of 
the benevolent individual who endowed it, in the district of Borve. 
Mr Donald Macdermid, late of South Carolina, bequeathed 
L. 1000 to endow a school in Borve, where he was born, for 
the purpose of teaching English, writing, and arithmetic gratis 
to the poor children of that district. In building a suitable school- 
house, and improving an acre of land for the schoolmaster, about 
L.200 were expended by the trustees, which lessened considera- 
bly the original fund ; yet, by accumulation of interest and good 
management, they expect to give a salary of L.35 to the school- 
master, who is allowed to take moderate fees from such scholars 
as can afford them. The school is in high repute and numerous- 
ly attended. Lord Macdonald's factor, the ministers of Portree,

heirs and successors, are trustees, with unlimited power as to the 
management of the school, and appointment of the teacher. Ow- 
ing to the poverty of the people, the fees in each of these schools 
are very inconsiderable. 

Fuel. — The fuel is peats, which the women carry home in creels 
on their backs, from a very great distance.

THE REV. JOHN R. GLASS, MINISTER  



I._ToPOGRAPJiY AND NATURAL HiSTORY. 

' 'Name. — The name of the parish, which appears to be com- 
pounded of the Celtic adjective hreac spotted, and the Norse 
ord dale field, has been the same from time immemorial. 

Extent. — Its length is about 20, and its extreme breadth about 
8 miles. 

Boundaries, c— It is bounded on the south and south-west by 
the sea ; on the north, by the parish of Duirinish ; on the east, by 
the parishes of Snizort and Portree ; and on the south-east, by the 
parish of Strath. Its form is very irregular, being intersected by 
arms of the sea in various directions. The only hills in it of par- 
ticular interest are part of that ranged called Coullin, stretching 
along the boundary between it and the parish of Strath, and so 
justly celebrated for their picturesque appearance ; and a hill call- 
ed Friosmheall, overhanging the farm-house of Tallisker. But 
the surface is in general very hilly. 

In that district of the parish called Minginish, there are various 
valleys which form almost the only low and flat lands ; but that of 
Tallisker is the only one worthy of particular remark, its forma- 
tion being highly romantic, and its soil particularly fertile. In 
the other district, there are several detached fields along the 
coast.

The extent of coast is probably about 60 miles : it is Hat in 
some places, but, for the most part, high and rocky. In the bays 
the shore is either sandy or clayey ; but in the more exposed parls 
of the coast very rough and stony. 

The principal bays are Lochs Bracadale and Eynort, both af- 
fording safe and commodious anchorage to vessels of any burden. 
The head-lands are Rhuandunan, the southernmost point of the 
parish, and Tallisker-head to the west, at the southern entrance 
of Loch Bracadale. The islands are Soay, Wiay, and Taarner; 
the first lying about south-east by east of the point of Rhuandu- 
nan, opposite to Loch Skavaig, at the head of which is the cele- 
brated Cuiruisg, for a description of which and the surrounding 
scenery, the reader is referred to the notes appended to Sir Wal- 
ter Scott's poem of the Lord of the Isles ; the two last lying at the 
mouth of Loch Bracadale, opposite Tallisker-head to the north. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owner. — Macleod of Macleod is sole proprietor. 
Parochial Register.— TheiiVochnxX register is but of a recent date, 

and is as regularly kept as the present state of the law will admit; 
for, without a legislative enactment rendering it imperative on par- 
ties to register births and deaths, no regularity can ever be expect- 
ed in the matter. 

Antiquities.—There are no antiquities worthy of notice, unless 
It be the ruins of two circular towers, the most entire of which is 
close by, and seen from, the Parliamentary road, about a mile and 
a-half from the manse northwards. 

Modern Buildings, — The only modern buildings are the church, 
a distillery, two slated houses on feued ground lately built, and 
some farm-houses, all of the ordinary materials. 

III. — Population. 

At the time of the last Statistical Account, the population was 
2250 souls. By the last census it was 1769, and since that pe- 
riod there has been a farther decrease. This decrease is solely to 
be ascribed to the system of fiirming which has for some time been 
adopted, viz. throwing a number of farms into one large tack for 
sheep-grazing, and dispossessing and setting adrift the small tenants. 

The average number of persons under 15 years of age is 589 

betwixt 15 and 30, - 565

There is only one gentleman of supposed independent fortune 
residing in the parish. 

There are about 20 unmarried men, bachelors, and widowers 
upwards of fifty years of age, and about 150 unmarried women 
upwards of forty, five years of age. The average number of chil- 
dren in each family is 4. 

Language. — The language generally spoken is Gaelic ; and it 
has lost no ground within the last forty years. 

Habits of the People. — The habits of the people are far from 
cleanly. In their dress, they are not different from the other inhabi- 
tants of the Hebrides; and as to their food they are generally not 
considered ill provided, who can feed on potatoes and salt; and dur- 
ing the last season even that would have been a luxury to many of 
them. Regarding their comforts as to clothing, it may be suffi- 
cient to mention, that, when it was apprehended the cholera would 
spread to these quarters, inquiries were directed to be made on 
this point, and there were 140 families found in the parish who 
had no change of night or day-clothes. From the above remarks 
as to food and clothing, it must appear evident, that the people 
are far from enjoying the ordinary comforts of society ; and, un- 
der such circumstances, it is but natural they should feel discon- 
tented with their situation ; and if their complaints are not more 
loudly heard, one great reason is, that the system of farming pur- 
sued has placed them in such absolute dependence on the tacks- 
men, as to preclude any hope of amelioration. 

Character. — The people, in general, are shrewd and sagacious, 
and manifest a good degree of intellect as to the ordinary aflFairs 
of life ; as to morality and religion, it is yet but a day of small 
things. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The number of arable acres, according to survey, 
is 4878; of pasture and hill-grazing, 68,311. From the system 
of farming already mentioned, the proportion of the arable ground 
in cultivation is inconsiderable. 

There is no arable land rented separately. The average rent 
of grazing is at the rate of L. 3 per cow, and at the rate of 2s. 6d. 
per ewe for the year. 

Leases. — The general duration of leases is fifteen years. The 
staple produce of the parish is sheep and cattle, on the rearing of 
which considerable attention is bestowed. Of sheep, there are 
annually exported about 4500, and of black-cattle about 450.

V. — Pauociiiai, Economy. 
Means of Communimtion.~T\viXQ is a post-office at Struan, 
about half a mile west from the manse, close by the Parliamentary 
road, which, from one end of the parish to the other, is in extent 
about twenty miles. The road and bridges are always kept in 
good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated in a hollow 
spot of ground on the north side of a small arm of Loch Braca- 
dale, called Lochbeg, within a few yards of the public road, about 
a quarter of a mile below the manse, as conveniently as it could 
well be placed ; the greater part of the population being dis- 
tant six miles from the northern, and about fourteen miles from 
the southern extremity of the parish. It was built in 1831, and 
affords accommodation to between 500 and 600 sitters. The sit- 
tings are all free. 

The manse was built about forty years ago, and received some 
additions and repairs in 1828. The glebe contains about 30 
acres, and its value is about L. 15. The amount of the stipend 
is L. 150. 

There is one missionary supported by the Royal Bounty. 
There is a catechist supported by the Society for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge. Divine service is always well attended. 
The average number of communicants is about 20. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish ; the paro- 
chial school, and other four schools, supported partly by societies, 
and partly by private subscriptions. The branches generally 
taught, are, Gaelic, English, writing, and arithmetic. The sa- 
lary of the parochial schoolmaster is L. 28. Those of the rest 
vary from L. 8 to L. 25. The amount of school fees, in all cases, 
is merely nominal. The parish schoolmaster is provided with 
the legal accommodation. The general expense of education is 
quite trifling. The number of the young between six and fifteen 
years of age who cannot write or read is nearly 400 ; the number 
of persons upwards of fifteen years who cannot read or write is 
near 800. 

The people, in general, are not so much alive to the benefits of 
education as could be wished \ at the same time, their poverty is 
such as to prevent them from following up their inclination in 
that respect, even to the degree in which it exists. 

There are some parts of the parish with a considerable popula- 
tion, several miles distant from any school. Two or three schools 



BRACADALE. 



•299 



would supply this deficiency. The Gaelic schools, wherever they 
have been established, have evidently been instrumental in pro- 
moting the interests of morality and religion. 

Poor and Farochinl Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 64. The average sum allotted to each 
person is between 4s. and 5s. ; the annual amount of contribu- 
tion is L. 20, 12s.; of which L. 7 arise from church collections, 
L. 10 from a bequest, and L. 3, 12s. from money at interest. To 
receive parochial relief was, till of late, almost universally consi- 
dered as degrading ; but that feeling is now rapidly giving way. 

There is an annual tryst held within the parish in the month 
of September. 

Alehouses. — There are five licensed whisky houses; and whisky 
is retailed in various other places within the parish, to the mani- 
fest injury of the temporal interests of the people, and the pro- 
gressive and sure destruction of their morals. 

Fuel. — The only fuel used in the parish, except in gentlemen's 
houses, is peat. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical 
Account, are, 1. The formation of . a Parliamentary road, which 
goes nearly over its whole length : 2. The system of farming for 
some time followed, of several farms being thrown into one graz- 
ing : 3. The erection and establishment of a whisky distillery. 
The first of these variations is a decided benefit to the parish ; 
the second, as decided a disadvantage to its general population ; 
and the third, one of the greatest curses which, in the ordinary 
course of Providence, could befall it or any other place.

PRESBYTERY OF SKYE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. JOHN MACKINNON, MINISTER." 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish is known by the names of Srath Mhic 
Jonmhuin7, or Mackinnon's valley, and of Strath-Swordale, from 
the Gaelic word Srath, signifying a valley through which a river 
runs, and Swordale, a place situated in the centre of the parish. 
But, for the sake of brevity, it is always called Strath. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The extreme length of the parish may 
be estimated at about 26 miles, and its mean breadth at about 6 
miles. It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Portree ; on 
the south, by the parish of Sleat ; on the east, by the sea, which 
divides it from the mainland of Applecross and Lochalsh ; and on 
the west, by the parish of Rracadale. 

Topographical Appearances. — To the admirer of nature, this pa- 
rish presents objects of no ordinary interest. On its western boun- 
dary is situated a landscape of unparalleled grandeur. No place, 
perhaps, affords more picturesque subjects for the painter than parts 
of this parish. In it he meets with such prodigality of natural won- 
ders, that he must feel as if bewildered, and at a loss to make a choice. 
The scenery shifts at every step, and each successive view seems 
to excel the rest. The cloud-capped Cuillin raises its inacces- 
sible pinnacles beyond the other mountains, and is visible in almost 
every part of the island. Next in order Marsco, Blath-Bheinn 
and Beilig shoot themselves forth in every variety of fantastic 
figure and appearance, each struggling for supremacy with its 
neighbour, and each possessing every imaginable characteristic of 
native rudeness and grandeur. On entering the Bay of Scavaig, 
the spectator is struck with the rugged outline presented by the 
spiry and serrated peaks of the lofty Cuillin. On landing, he finds 
himself surrounded by rocks denuded of every vestige of vegeta- 
tion. As he advances, a valley, enclosed by mountains of the most 
precipitous character, opens to the view, thus encircling and form-

ing the dark lake of Cbir-Uisge, which is here and there studded 
with small green islands, contrasting remarkably with the surround- 
ing barrenness. 

, Rarely human eye has known 

A scene so stern as that dread lake, 

With its dark ledge of barren stone. 
Seems that primeval earthquakes sway 
Had rent a strange and shatter'd way 

Through the rude bosom of the hill. 
And that each naked precipice, 
Sable ravine, and dark abyss,j 

Tells of the outrage still. 
The wildest glen, but tins, can show 
Some touch of nature's glo~w ; 
On high Benmore green inosses grow, 
And heath bells bud in deep Glencroe,

But here, above, around, below,

Nor aught of vegetative power

A few miles to the south of this scene is a cave which has of 
late been frequently resorted to by travellers, from being one 
of the numerous places of refuge occupied by Prince Charles Ed- 
ward Stuart during his eventful career. Proceeding again to the 
northward, we soon reach the far-famed Spar-cave of Strathaird. 
Here we have another most striking specimen of nature's grandest 
workmanship. Every visitor must admire this lofty vaulted cave, 
resplendent with pure white icicles of semitransparent spar, — and 
having its roof supported, and its sides decorated, with massive co- 
lumns and drapery of the same sparkUng material. At the inmost 
recess, is a circular pond formed of shining spar, which nature 
has located there as a reservoir to contain the water which oozes 
through chinks of the roof. But of this fairy spot a more correct 
idea may be formed from the following lively description of it. 

• " The first entrance to this celebrated cave," says the author of Waverley, " is 
rude and unpromising ; but the light of the torches with which we were provided 
was soon reflected from the roof, floor, and walls, which seem as if they were sheeted 
with marble — partly smooth, partly rough — seeming to be wrought into statuary. The 
floor forms a steep and diflScult ascent, and might be fancifully compared to a sheet 
of water which, while it rushed whitening and foaming down a declivity, had been 
suddenly arrested by the spell of an enchanter. Upon attaining the summit of the 
ascent, the cave opens into a splendid gallery, adorned with the most dazzhng crystal- 
lizations, jind finally descends with rapidity to the brink of a pool of the most lim-

Meteorology.— T\\Q prevailing winds are the south and south- 
west, which generally prognosticate rain. North and east winds, 

on the contrary, are in summer the harbingers of fine weather, 

but in winter of sleet, frost, and snow. The climate is cold, damp, 
and changeable ; and the complaints over which it may be said to 
exercise any influence, are, as may be supposed, acute rheumatism, 
pleuritic affections, consumption, and other pulmonary ailments. 
From the purity of the atmosphere, however, a well as from the 
refreshing nature of the sea air, the climate must be acknowledged 
upon the whole to be salubrious. 

Hydrography. — The parish presents an irregular figure, being 
much intersected by arms of the sea, all of which afford safe and 
commodious anchorage for ships of any burden. Fresh water 
springs are both numerous and copious. Many of them are 
strongly impregnated with iron. It also abounds with lakes, which, 
though of inconsiderable extent, are well stocked with trout, and 
some of them with salmon. 

Geology. — The mountains chiefly consist of trap and syenite ; 
the lower grounds and valleys of limestone. A bed of marl of 
the finest quality extends across the parish from the farm of Tor- 
ran on Loch Slappen, to Skinidean on the Sound of Scalpay. 

In some localities, the calcareous strata are to be found alter- 
nating with brown calcareous sandstone, and with shale, contain- 
ing the organic remains of fish and shell-fish. In the Island of 
Fabbay, on the eastern shore of the parish, petrified fish, princi- 
pally eels, from six to eighteen inches long, have been found in a 
high state of preservation. A variety of other kinds of fish, and 
also oysters, mussels, welks, and limpets, are frequently met with 
in the same state. 

From the head of Loch Slappen, a considerable alluvial deposit 
may be traced through the valley of Strathmore to Loch Eynort. 
Near Kyleakin, a deposition of greater importance occurs, occu- 
pying a space of about a mile along the shore. Dr MacCulloch 
regarded this as the remains of a plain formerly much more ex- 
tensive. He says that it exhibits the appearances which charac- 
terize the alluvial valleys through which active rivers have cut 
their way ; and that the supposition of this being the result of the 

pid water, about four or five yards broad. This pool, surrounded by the most ftmciful 
mouldings in a substance resembling white marble, and distinguished by the depth 

and purity of its waters, might have been the bathing grotto of a Naiad" Note V.

decay of the mountains which back the plain, is invahdated by 
the presence of gneiss, hornblende, and schist, which do not occur 
in these mountains. 

Zoology. — Mammalia. — Red-deer abound in Lord Macdonald's 
forest ; and roe-deer are to be found in the woods. We have the 
fox and wild-cat, both particularly destructive to lambs, game, and 
poultry. We have likewise the weasel ; but the only polecat 
ever seen in the island was some years ago killed in this parish, 
in the vicinity of one of the ferries to the mainland. From this 
circumstance, it is probable that it might have unobserved found 
its way across in the ferry-boat. The otter and seal are common, 
and are very destructive to salmon. 

Land Birds, — These are, grouse, black-game, ptarmigan, and 
partridges, the eagle, and a variety of hawks ; the raven, the hood- 
ed-crow, &amp;c. &amp;c. A grouse with white wings was last season shot 
on the property of Mr Macalister of Strathaird, and a rook with 
white wings has been observed in the parish. 

Aquatic Birds. — Wild geese, the cormorant, the scart, the 
teal, the mallard, the tern or sea-swallow, and a variety of gulls. 

Waders. — The heron, the water-hen, the corn -rail, the wood- 
cock, the snipe, the golden plover, the lapwing, &amp;c. The corn- 
rail appears early in -May, and takes its departure in September. 
The woodcock appears early in October, and leaves early in 
March. 

" Fishes. — These are, the salmon and trout, which ascend the 
rivers for spawning about the middle of September, and are suppos- 
ed to return to the sea in February : the cod, haddock, whiting, 
ling, lythe, coal-fish, skate, sand-eel, conger-eel, thornback, floun- 
der, sole, and, occasionally, a John Doree ; the angler or sea-devil, 
the grey and red gurnard, the mullet, the dog-fish, the king-fish, 
and cuttle-fish, &amp;c. 

Shell-Fish. — At the Sound of Scalpay there is an extensive 
bed of oysters of a superior quality, but of small size. We have 
also the mussel, the cockle, the razor-fish, the welk, the crab, the 
limpet, and the lobster ; all of which are of considerable import- 
ance in an economical point of view, being much used as food by 
the lower orders during the summer months in particular, and du- 
ring seasons of scarcity in general. 

Botany. — The only plants peculiar to this parish are the rare 
Eriocaulon septangulare ; and the Dryas octopetala of the limestone, 
which occurs in great profusion. All the varieties of planted

timber thrive well when duly fenced and properly preserved. An 
ash has been observed to grow nearly fonr feet in the course of 
one season. Of all the indigenous timbers, the soil seems most 
congenial to ash, birch, and hazel. Apples, pears, cherries, goose- 
berries, and currants thrive well, and are found in all the gardens. 
It is evident that the pine must have, at some remote period, been 
a native of the parish, as the trunks of fir trees of considerable 
size are found deeply imbedded in the moss in different parts of it. 

II. — Civil HisTony. 
This parish is known to have been, as far back as the year 1354, 
the family property of the Mackinnons, who took a prominent part 
in the turbulent proceedings of that period, as well as in the more 
recent disturbances of 1715 and 1745. The Mackinnon of that 
day, who espoused the cause of the Pretender, was arrested and 
taken to London to stand his trial for high treason ; and, after 
being confined for nearly twelve months in Tilbury Fort, the Go- 
vernment, in consideration of his advanced age, and seeino- that 
he had been involved in these revolts rather from a spirit of chi- 
valry than of rebellion, set him at large, with liberty to return 
home. Being reminded by Sir Dudley Ryder, then Attorney- 
General, of the debt of gratitude which he owed to his sovereio-n 
for this act of clemency, when, by rebellion, he had forfeited both 
his life and property, Mackinnon quaintly replied, " Had I the 
King in my power, as I am in his, I would return him the com- 
pliment, by sending him back to his own country." William 
Alexander Mackinnon, Esq. M. P. for Lymington, and author of 
a work of great merit on Public Opinion, now represents the an- 
cient family of Mackinnon. The late Colonel Mackinnon of the 
Coldstream Guards, so well known for the elegance of his man- 
ners, and for his extraordinary feats of strength and agility, as 
well as for his distinguished bravery during the peninsular war, 
and in the ever memorable battle of Waterloo, was brother to 
the present chief. General Henry Mackinnon, so frequently and 
honourably mentioned in the Duke of WeUington's Despatches, 
and who fell at Cuidad Roderigo, after having in the most gallant 
style secured possession of that fortress, was his uncle. 

Land-owners. — The only heritors in the parish are Lord Mac- 
donald and Mr Macalister of Strathaird. This parish, originally 
the property of Mackinnon, was purchased about eighty years ago • 
by the Trustees of the great and good Sir James Macdonald, then 
a minor, from the Trustees of Mackinnon of Mackinnon, when a

minor also. The sale was afterwards reduced by the Court of 
Session, but, on appeal to the House of Lords, it was confirm- 
ed. Although the people at the time, from feelings of clanship 
and attachment to their chieftain, were much displeased with the 
decision which had been come to by the House of Lords, yet they 
had no cause to regret the change, as each successive proprietor 
of the Noble family of Macdonald was invariably kind, attentive, 
and indulgent to their tenants ; and it is pleasant to observe, that 
the young and Noble Lord who now represents that ancient family, 
promises fairly to walk in the footsteps of his truly excellent pre- 
decessors. 

The property of Strathaird was purchased fifty-four years ago 
by Mr Macalister, who likewise proved a most kind and indulgent 
proprietor. He is now represented by his grandson, Mr Macalister 
of Loup, in Argyleshire, — a young man of much promise. 

Parochial Register. — The earliest entry ii; the parochial regis- 
ter is dated 1821 ; from that period it has been regularly kept.' 

Antiquities. — There are the remains of several places of wor- 
ship, which were, in all probability, erected by the Culdees, -who 
are well known to have, many centuries ago, built a great number 
of " Cills," or places of worship throughout the Hebrides, which 
they invariably dedicated to the most renowned of their saints. 
There is one at a place in the parish called " Ashig." But there 
can be no doubt that it was primarily dedicated to Saint Asaph, 
which appellation was gradually corrupted into Ashig. There is 
also one at Kilbride, St Bride ; one at Kilmarie, {cella Ma- 
rice, or St Mary's ; and one in the Island of Pabbay. On 
the farm of Boreraig, we have Teamjmll Choain, or the Temple 
of St Coan ; and in the Island of Scalpay, Teampull Frangaig, 
or the Temple of St Francis. In front of the minister's house, 
there are the ruins of a place of worship ; and close to it 
stands a rude obelisk of granite, about ten feet high, perfect- 
ly erect. It is known by the appellation of Clach na h-Annait, 
that is, the stone of Annat, — a goddess mentioned by mytholo- 
gists. Near this stone, is a copious well of excellent water, call- 
ed Tobar na h-Annait, or Annat's Fountain, in which it is proba- 
ble the worshippers purified themselves. It frequently happens 
that the purest and most copious springs of water are dedicated by 
such worshippers to their tutelary saints ; and among the excellent 
springs with which this parish abounds one is considered superior 
to all, and is called Tobar Ashig, or St Asaph's Well. We have 



30G 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



also Tohar Chliamen, or St Clement's Well. The principal place 
of worship was at Kilchrist, evidently Cella Chr{sti,—a burying- 
ground consecrated to Christ. This is in the centre of the pa- 
rish ; but, being found inconvenient on account of its remoteness 
from the more populous part of it, the new and handsome church, 
now building, is situated at Broadford. 

On the west side of the parish are the ruins of seven Danish 
forts or duns. They are situated on high rocks or lofty head- 
lands, and were built without mortar. One of them was always 
built in view of one or more of the rest, so that the first alarm of 
an approaching foe was almost instantaneously communicated to 
the whole country by the Crois-tdraidh or fiery -cross ; being a rude 
process of telegraphing by fire the intelligence of an enemy's ap- 
proach. 

This watch-fire was lighted on the tower from which the 
danger was first discerned. The process was repeated by the next 
tower in view, and so on until the intimation was transmitted with 
inconceivable celerity throughout the whole chain of towers with 
which the country was surrounded. 

On the east side are a number of tumuli, and in all of them 
which have been opened stone-coffins, containing human bones or 
urns full of ashes, have been found. In these urns, small copper 
coins have generally been discovered. An urn, containing ashes 
and bones partially burnt, and a very thin copper coin, was found 
when digging the foundation of the minister's house. 

It is very probable that those whose remains were thus disturb- 
ed were strangers, and that the coins were deposited for the pur- 
pose of purchasing a right to the burying-grotuid. This opinion is 
greatly corroborated by the fact, that, in many parts of the High- 
lands still, when the remains of a stranger are committed to the 
dust, a coin is usually thrown into the grave so that he may, by 
purchase, acquire an undisputed right to his resting-place. 

A great variety of coins have been dug up at different times and 
places ; but, owing to their being much defaced, it could not be as- 
certained to what period they belonged. A coin of the reign of 
Henry VIII., in a state of high preservation, was recently turned 
up on the glebe, and is now in the possession of the incumbent. 

Near the village of Broadford there is a cairn or barrow, in 
which a very remarkable vault has been discovered. It is arched 
in with a concave roof, having its top covered with a flag. This 
curious little chamber is securely although rudely built with stone, 
without any lime or mortar, and is of sufficient dimensions to permit 



ISLAND OF SKYE — STRATH. 30 

a person to stand in it erect. It was evidently the burying-place 
of some renowned character of old, and within it was found a rude 
buckle, probably belonging to the shroud of the person consigned 
to the dust; and also a dark-green stone, about four inches long 
by two and a half in breadth, a quarter of an inch in thickness, and 
beautifully polished. It had a hole perforated in each corner, 
with one side partially concave, and the other convex. It appear- 
ed like an ornament belonging to the Highland belt. This stone 
and buckle were given to the late Donald Gregory, Esq., Secretary 
to the Antiquarian Society, Edinburgh. 

Eminent Men. — I am not aware that this parish ever gave birth 
to any person eminently distinguished in any walk of Hfe. Some, 
however, were born in it, who have by their own merits attained a 
high and honourable rank in the army. Sir John Macdonald, the 
present Adjutant-General of Her Majesty's Forces, is son to the 
late Mr Macdonald, tacksman of Scalpay, an island belonging to 
this parish ; as was also Colonel Archibald Macdonald, who held 
the same situation in India ; and a third and no less distinguished 
member of the same family. Colonel Alexander Macdonald of the 
Horse Artillery, whose devotion to his profession, as well as his 
bravery at the taking of Monte Video, the Cape of Good Hope, 
the whole of the peninsular war, and the battle of Waterloo, re- 
peatedly gained for him the approbation of the Duke of Welling- 
ton and Lord Hill. Colonel Macdonald is now Governor of Hon - 
duras. 

Modern Buildings. — The houses of the tacksmen are comfort- 
able and commodious, yielding in this respect to none of the same 
class in the Highlands. 

A village was commenced at Kyleakin, under the auspices of 
the late Lord Macdonald, but, from the want of capital in the 
country, it has made little or no progress. There are, however, 
about a dozen of good slated houses at this place, including some, 
shops, and a very comfortable well-kept inn. At Broadford, there 
are likewise a good inn, two shops, a mill, and a smithy.

Within the last forty years, the population of this parish has been 
more than doubled. In 1837, it amounted to 3450 souls ; but since 
that period, about 200 have emigrated to Australia. 



308 



INVEllNESS-SHIRE. 



The great increase of the population is to be attributed to the 
lotting system, by which tenants are supplied with small portions 
of land inadequate for their support. But this is not all, for the 
possessions which were originally too contracted, were subsequently 
subdivided by the parents among the various members of the fa- 
mily as they got married. There was in this manner an accumu- 
lation of houses and famihes without any means for their support, 
or any prospect of comfort. This evil for evij it must be called, 
when three, and in many cases four families are to be found occu- 
pying the lands which were originally barely sufficient for the sup- 
port of one family, has been, and will continue to be productive 
of the worst effects here, as well as over a great part of the High- 
lands. And unless some method be devised to provide for the 
superfluous population, and to check its increase in future, the 
most disastrous consequences may be anticipated. 

Language. — Gaelic is the language of the country, and that for 
the most part preached ; but of late, in consequence of the con- 
stant intercourse held by the natives with the low country, it is 
very much corrupted with a mixture of English words and phrases. 

Habits and State of the People. — It is to be regretted that the 
people have not more regard to cleanliness. The cattle and 
poultry are generally to be found under -the same roof with the 
rational inmates, and separated only by a tallan or partition, for the 
most part made of stone or wattled-work, a few feet in height. 
They wear home-made woollen clothes, and are very expert at 
dyeing almost all colours. Their diet chiefly consists of potatoes 
and herrings, occasionally varied with meal and milk. They are, 
however, contented with their condition, and, singular to relate, 
contemplate with uneasiness a permanent removal from their na- 
tive soil. 

As their possessions are too limited to aff'ord employment for 
all who are located on them, almost all the young men leave the 
country annually, and resort to the south, in vast numbers, in quest 
of any employment which they may procure. In the same man- 
ner, many of the young women go to the Lothians in harvest to 
procure employment in reaping. They are generally most mind- 
ful and attentive in sending a part of their earnings home to their 
parents, to pay the rents, as well as for other useful purposes. 

Character. — They are, with few exceptions, of sober and cor- 
rect habits, — charitable to their less fortunate neighbours, — hos- 
pitable and attentive to strangers, — and obedient and respectful 



ISLAND OP SKYli STRATH.

to their superiors. Flagrant breaches of the peace are almost un- 
known, there being but two instances on record of criminal prose- 
cutions against natives of this parish. 

Longevity. — We have had several instances of longevity. A 
woman of the name of Mary Innes, a native of Ross-shire, died 
here some years ago at the advanced age of 110. The father of 
the present incumbent, who was for sixty-five years an ordained 
clergymen, and fifty-two years minister of this parish, died at the 
age of ninety-six, and to the last retained all his faculties unim- 
paired. Mr Macalister of Strathaird, died at the age of eighty- 
nine, and his sister, who departed this life last winter, attained the 
age of ninety-two. There are a few others now living between 
eighty and ninety years of age ; and one man in his eighty-fourth 
year, who never wore any dress but the kilt, and this year walk- 
ed twenty-four miles in one day. 

The number of illegitimate children for the last three years has 
been four. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Lord Macdonald's property in this parish con- 
sists of 54,768 acres, of which about 1800 are arable, 594 under 
wood, and the rest almost entirely green and hill pasture. The 
estate of Strathaird consists of 1 6,000 acres, of which about 300 
are arable, and the remainder green and hill pasture. It is ob- 
served, that, where limestone abounds, the pasture is invariably rich 
and luxuriant ; but where whin and granite prevail, it is of very in- 
ferior quality. 

Husbandry. — The only grain raised is oats and bear. The cul- 
tivation of wheat has been attempted, but with no prospect of ade- 
quate remuneration. 

Potatoes, however, form the principal crop. They are planted 
in April and May, and are manured chiefly with sea- ware. In 
favourable seasons they yield an increase of about ten returns ; but 
even in the most favourable years, the supply is inadequate to the 
wants of the population. It is a remarkable fact, that in wet sea- 
sons, the quality of the potatoes is much superior to what it is in 
dry seasons, although the quantity is diminished. Turnips and 
clover are cultivated, and are found amply to remunerate the far- 
mer from their efficacy in the prevention of braxy. A consi- 
derable quantity of waste land was reclaimed by the late Mr 
Mackinnon of Corry. The district in the neighbourhood of his 
residence afforded the means of carrying on improvements, such 



310 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



as sea-ware, lime, marl, and shell-sand ; and of these facilities he 
amply availed himself, as did his active and vigorous mind of every 
thing that could benefit the country. He also did much in the way 
of draining, fencing, and enclosing his fields, as well as in plant- 
ing hedges and hedge-rows, which are now in a thriving condition. 

Although the crofting system was in many respects baneful and 
injurious, yet it had the perceptible advantage of improving the 
aspect of the country, as each crofter, by having a small allotment 
for himself, was anxious to turn it to the best account, which could 
not be effected by the old run -rig system. Bone dust has been 
used with encouraging success, and amply remunerated the expense 
of applying it. 

Rent of Land. — The value of arable land may be estimated at 
IDs. per acre. The grazing of a cow at L.2, 10s. per annum, 
and of a sheep at 2s. 6d. 

Wages.— GooA farm-servants receive from L.6 to L.IO per an- 
num ; women from L.2, 10s. to L.3, 10s. ; carpenters and masons 
about 2s. per day with their victuals. Shepherds, instead of money 
wages, are generally allowed a house, 6 bolls of meal ; the graz- 
ing of two cows, and of from 40 to 60 sheep per annum. 

Live-Stock. — The principal sheep stocks are of the Cheviot 
breed; but there are some small flocks of the black- faced descrip- 
tion, which are esteemed more hardy. To the improvement of 
each breed their respective owners pay particular attention. A 
breed of black-cattle, of the most exquisite symmetry and beauty, 
was produced by the late Mr Macdonald of Scalpay and the late 
Mr Mackinnon of Corry, who, by much attention and expense in 
the selection of breeding stock, raised their cattle to a value never 
before attained in this country. The cattle of the small tenants 
in this parish are superior to those reared in the northern districts 
of the island, in consequence of their stocks having been always 
supplied with bulls by the individuals already mentioned. 

Quarries. — Freestone and marble, which abound in this parish, 
have been worked by Lord Macdonald, the former for building, 
and the latter for architectural ornaments in his elegant castle at 
Armadale. The marble quarries have also been worked by the 
Duke of Hamilton for paving the lobby of Hamilton Palace, and 
by the Board of Ordnance for powder-mill stones. It was, how- 
ever, abandoned by the Board, from the impracticability of finding 
blocks sufficiently large for their purpose. 

A lime-kiln is in operation in the vicinity of Broadford, which 



ISLAND OF SKYli—STRATH. 



311 



supplies an extensive district with lime of a superior quality. To 
the public it is sold at 9d. per boll ; but Lord Macdonald, with his 
usual attention to the interests of his tenants, binds the lessee of 
the lime kiln to supply them with lime for building at 6d. ; and 
for land at 4d. per boll. 

Fisheries. — The herring-fishing was at one time so productive 
in the bays of the parish, that 60 or 70 vessels, averaging about 
40 tons, were annually engaged in it, and many of them carrying 
away several cargoes in the course of the year. It is still prose- 
cuted with considerable vigour, but for many years back with very 
indifferent success ; so much so, indeed, that where 60 or 70 
vessels could formerly be loaded in a few wefeks, one could 
not now be loaded in the course of a whole season. The 
failure of this most important source of emolument to many a 
poor and industrious fisherman on the west coast, is coeval with, 
and by many ascribed to the destruction of such countless multi- 
tudes of this prolific fish at the spawning season, on the east coast 
of Scotland. The cod and ling fishing is carried on during the 
months of January, February, March, and -April. In favourable 
years, those engaged in it realize from L. 3 to L. 4 per man, be- 
sides having an abundant supply of other fish for the use of their 
own famihes. Salmon-fishing is carried on, but not on a very ex- 
tensive scale. It closes on the 14th of September, and does not 
generally commence until the middle of May. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market'Town. — At Broadford three markets are annually held 
for the sale of black-cattle and horses. 

Means of Communication. — Broadford is likewise a post-town, 
where the mails arrive and are despatched three times a week. 
Within the incumbent's recollection, letters from London took ten 
days in reaching Broadford, but now they arrive there on the third 
night. 

From Broadford the mails are carried across Kyleakin ferry, by 
a runner to Lochcarron, whence they are conveyed to Dingwall 
by a gig, having accommodation for the conveyance of passengers. 

About thirty miles of Parliamentary road, and ten of statute la- 
bour, pass in different directions through the parish. During the 
summer and harvest months we have a regular weekly communi- 
cation with Glasgow by steam-boats ; but in winter they ply only 
once a fortnight. Not many years ago, the voyage from Skye to 
the Clyde generally occupied from ten to fifteen days, while now 
it is usually performed in about thirty-six hours. 



312 



INViiUNESS-SIIIKE. 



Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in the burying- 
ground of Kilchrist, and might accommodate about 200 sitters. 
It is very old, and was formerly a Roman Catholic place of wor- 
ship. It is now in a very ruinous condition, so much so, indeed, 
that for nearly two years back there has been no preaching in it. 
A very handsome and commodious church, to be seated for 600, 
has just been commenced at Broadford, as being a locality more 
accessible to the bulk of the population. In the district of Strath- 
aird, in which divine service is performed every third Sabbath, a 
comfortable church was last year fitted up by the Trustees of Mr 
Macalister. But previous to this there was no church in that dis- 
trict ; and the incumbent's father when he preached there, officiat- 
ed in the recess or cavity of a rock, for a period of fifty-two years. 

There has never been a manse in this parish, the incumbents 
always occupying farm-houses in the vicinity of the glebe, which 
consists of 44 acres, and is valued at about L. 15 per annum. 
The stipend is L.271, 2s. 6d. The Crown is patron. An intel- 
ligent catechist, paid by the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowledge, is constantly employed. A Baptist missionary has been 
stationed here for the last twelve years ; but, from the firm attach- 
ment of the people to the Established Church,, only sixteen con- 
verts have been made, and of these six are not natives of the pa- 
rish. 

Public worship is generally well attended ; but, owing to the 
extent of the parish, the ruinous state of the church, and the re- 
mote distance from it at which the great majority of the people 
reside, their attendance is much influenced by the state of the 
weather. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish, — one paro- 
chial, two unendowed, and supported by the parents of the chil • 
dren, and two on the establishment of the Gaelic School Society. 
The parochial school is in the possession of an efficient teacher, 
and is well attended, particularly during the winter. The branches 
usually taught are, English reading, writing, and arithmetic. Very 
few now prosecute the study of Latin and Greek, although the 
teacher is well qualified to give instruction in those branches. 
From the detached position of the different hamlets in the parish, 
the parochial school can never be generally useful to the inhabit- 
ants. Three additional schools would supply all our wants in the 
way of education, in a manner sufficient for the diffusion of useful 
and salutary knowledge ; and it is pleasant to observe that the peo- 



ISLAND OP SKYE STllATH. 313 

jle in general are becoming more alive to the advantages of edu- 
cation. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly, it may be said entirely, used is peat, of 
which the supply is abundant and the quality excellent. It is pro- 
cured at comparatively little expense, being secured at a season of 
the year when there is a cessation from all other labour. Coal 
has been discovered on the estate of Strathaird, but was never 
wrought. The smith in that district tried its quality, and found 
it to answer his purpose well. 

Inns. — We have three inns, and in situations necessary for the 
accommodation of travellers. It cannot be said that they have any 
bad effect on the morals of the people. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the former Statistical Account of this parish was drawn 
out, various changes of importance have been effected. The 
means of diffusing useful knowledge have greatly increased, and 
the facilities for the attainment of general improvement have been 
extensively afforded. Improvements have taken place in the modes 
of communication with other parts of the kingdom. The mails 

have been accelerated— roads have been formed in all directions 

steamers and other packets have been established. But al- 
though the benefits arising from such modes of communication are 
great, yet some of them are attended with disadvantages, as they 
are the means of introducing into the country a variety of vaorants, 
such as gipsies, rag-men, venders of crockery, tinsmiths" egg- 
dealers, and old-clothes-men. By characters of this description, 
manners and habits, which were formerly unknown to the lower 
orders, are gradually introduced, such as teanirinking, tobacco 
chewing and smoking. The disadvantages of such habits are 
sufficiently apparent ; and while temperance and total absti- 
nence societies, in regard to spirituous liquors, are establish- 
ed with such noted success throughout the kingdom, we would 
earnestly recommend anti-tea and tobacco societies to be set on 
foot here,— much more money being uselessly lavished on these ar- 
ticles than on intoxicating liquors of any description. 

Of late years, the sale of eggs for the Glasgow market has be- 
come a general and useful traffic ; but it is matter of regret that 
the money thus realized, which must amount to at least L. 100 per 
annum, should not be laid out more usefully than in the procur- 
ing of tea and tobacco. 

Great improvements have taken place in the agriculture of the

parish, from draining, trenching, fencing, and the'apphcation of 
lime, marl, and shell-sand. The cdschrom, or crooked-spade, is 
giving place to the plough, which is now drawn by two horses in- 
stead of four, as was the case not many years ago. The pannier 
or creel is also giving place to the cart, which is now in common 
use. The small oat is also fast disapjjearing, and, from the dilFer- 
ent varieties of great oats, we have fair returns ; but unless the seed 
is frequently changed, they soon degenerate, owing no doubt to 
the moist and cold nature of our climate. The crops, however, 
in the most favourable seasons, are inadequate to the support of 
the superabundant population. The consequence is, that they 
annually suffer privations in a greater or less degree. 

In the years 1836 and 1837, this parish, in common with the 
rest of the Highlands, experienced the effects of the alarming des- 
titution, which was so prevalent in consequence of the failure of 
the crops in general, and of the potatoes in particular, from some 
unaccountable causes. And had it not been for the laudable and 
philanthropic exertions of John Bowie, Esq. W.S., agent for Lord 
Macdonald, and of Dr Norman Macleod of Glasgow, and the 
timeous relief procured by the appeal of these gentlemen to a li- 
beral public, a fearful loss of life must have been the consequence. 
The recurrence of similar calamities can only be prevented by 
striking the evil at the root, — by the establishment of a systematic 
emigration conducted upon proper principles, and holding out such 
inducements as will overcome the amor patricB so strongly im- 
planted in the breast of every Highlander. 

If the indefatigable exertions of Mr Bowie to benefit the High- 
lands, and to promote emigration, were responded to by the High- 
land proprietors, with that energy which his judicious suggestions 
on this subject so well merit, and which the state of the country 
so loudly calls for, not only would they find it for their own ulti- 
mate advantage ; but their people might again be restored to the 
enjoyment of a competency of the necessaries of life, and to that 
status in society which they held until the introduction of the lot- 
ting system, at which period some of the best of the small tenants 
of this parish left it for North Carolina, one of whom brought 
more capital along with him than is now in the joint possession of 
all the tenants who occupy the form which he left. 

All traces of the feudal system have now disappeared, and most 
of the ancient manners and customs peculiar to the Highlanders 
have long ago sunk into oblivion. At one time the feudal lairds 



ISLAND OF SKYE 



— STRATH. 



315 



and chieftains had full power over the life and death of their vas- 
sals, and their injunctions, however unreasonable and severe, were 
peremptory. The following is a striking instance of the remarka- 
able habits that prevailed even in times comparatively modern. 

Until within the last ninety years, it was customary in this is- 
land when a tenant died, that the best horse in the possession of 
the widow was claimed by the laird, who sent his ground-officer or 
under factor to demand it immediately after the interment. This 
barbarous custom was tamely submitted to until it was checked by 
the following occurrence : A man of the name of Mackinnon in 
this parish, having died, the best horse in the possession of the 
poor widow was as usual claimed for the laird by the ground-officer, 
who, in executing his cruel order, experienced so much resistance 
from the poor widow, that he beat and bruised her to the effusion 
of her blood, when she told him that she hoped her son, then about 
a year old, would some day be revenged of him for the treatment 
she had that day received. Some years thereafter, the same 
ground-officer came upon a similar errand tea neighbouring farm, 
when he behaved with his usual insolence to another poor wi- 
dow, whom he likewise deprived of her best horse. This having 
come to the knowledge of young Mackinnon, then in his eigh- 
teenth year, and considered the strongest man in the parish, he 
pursued the ground-officer, whom he overtook within three miles 
of the laird's house, and desired him immediately to deliver to'him 
the widow's horse, at the same time putting him in mind of the treat- 
ment which his mother had received at his hands. The ground- 
officer refused to part with the horse, upon which battle was offered 
and accepted, but soon decided in favour of Mackinnon, who, 
with his dirk, cut off the head of his antagonist, washed it in a well 
by the road-side, which is still known by the name of Tobar 
a'chiiin, or the well of the head, — mounted the horse, and appeared 
at the laird's gate, having the head on the point of his dirk. Such 
an unusual spectacle attracted the notice of the servants, who in- 
formed the laird that Donnuchadh Mor, alias Big Duncan, was at 
the gate with the ground-officer's head, very anxious to see him. 
The laird could not at first believe that such a diabolical deed 
could be perpetrated, not knowing the causes which led to it, But, 
upon coming out, he was shocked to find the report correct; 
and, upon hearing Donnuchadh Mor's account of the recent trans- 
action, as well as the inhuman treatment which the mother had 
received seventeen years previously, he granted him a free pardon 



INVERNESS-SHIllE. 

and appointed him ground-officer, telling him, at the same time, 
tnat no widow upon his estate should ever again be deprived of 
any part of her property. 

About thirty years ago, an old man of the name of John Mac- 
innes died in this parish, who was one of the crew which ferried 
1 mice Charles Stuart from Strathaird to the mainland. The 

nnce was at this time accompanied by the chief of Mackinnon, 
who remained along with him until he should see. him safely embark- 
ed for France. Such being Mackinnon's intention, he despatch- 
ed the boat and cretv home. Before, however, they landed on their 
native island, they were espied by Captain Fergusson, who was at 
the time in search of the luckless Pretender, and were taken on 
board his sloop of war to undergo an examination as to their 
knowledge of the Royal wanderer's movements. Macinnes be- 
ing the principal man in the boat, and refusing to give any 
inte hgence on the subject, and spurning at the reward offered 
jor betraying the person whom he conceived to be the king of 
his chief, was ordered to the yard-arm to receive 500 lashes. 
At every fifty, he was asked to give the necessary information, 
which he scornfully refused to give ; and at last, after having en-- 
dured the full amount of the punishment awarded to him, he was 
set at hberty, or rather thrown into his boat apparently more dead 
than alive. The writer of this Account has a perfect recollection 
of seeing the marks of the " cat-o'-nine-tails" on Macinnes's back, 
and of hearing him relate the cruel treatment which he had 
received. The poor man always became furious when Captain 
Fergusson's name was mentioned. 

There is an immense block of granite on the glebe, weighing 
at least six tons, which is so nicely balanced on a level lime rock, 
that it moves by the slightest pressure of the finger. It has been 
evidently placed there by the ingenuity of man, but in what man- 
irer, or by what mechanical power, is a subject for the antiquarian 
to discover. 

Within the last three years, about 200 souls have emigrated to 
Australia from this parish. It is earnestly hoped that the favour- 
able accounts of those who have settled there, will induce many of 
the people to avail themselves of the great boon which is now 
offered to them, viz. a free passage, with every necessary and de- 
sirable comfort during the voyage. And so satisfied is the writer 
of this Account of the prosperity of that colony, that he has done 
all in his power to persuade his poor countrymen to emigrate to 



ISLAND OF SKYE — SLEAT. 



that country ; and, to convince them of his good intentions, as well 
as to prove the sincerity of his advice, he has himself sent thither 
three of his sons within the last two years, and, if spared for a few 
months longer, he proposes to send a fourth.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF SKYE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER M'lVOR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History, 
Extent, Boundaries, 8fc. — Sleat forms the south-eastern part 
of the Island of Skye. The parish commences to the north 
at Kyle-rhea, — a narrow ferry which separates Skye from the 
mainland of Glenelg, an'd it extends to the south-west along the 
sea. To the north, it is bounded by the parish of Strath, from 
which it is divided by a high ridge of hill from Kyle-rhea to 
Loch-in-daal. Opposite to Loch-in-daal, another branch of the 
sea, called Loch-Elshart, comes in from the westward, and is se- 
parated from Loch-in-daal by a narrow isthmus, about half a mile in 
breadth. The parish from Loch-in-daal forms a peninsula, ex- 
tending westward to the point of Sleat. The population is locat- 
ed on both sides of this peninsula. The length of the parish is 
about 25 miles, and its average breadth 5. 

Topographical Appearances. — The appearance of the parish is 
in many places interesting. The plantations around Armadale 
Castle, and towards the manse, give it an aspect of high cultiva- 
tion, not expected in such a remote district ; and the extent of 
land in culture is considerable. Above the plantations and the 
cultivated land, the low and bleak moorland forms a contrast to 
the bold character of the Strath hills seen over it, and more es- 
pecially to the precipitous and serrated outline of the Cuillin 
hills, which are at no great distance. The climate is humid, and 
the people are, in consequence, subject to severe rheumatic com- 
plaints. 

Hydrographj. — There are no lakes of any extent in the parish ; 
but there are a few moorland lochs, containing trout, that some- 



318 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



times affora sport to the angler. The narrowness of the peninsula, 
of which the parish chiefly consists, precludes an accumulation of 
water sufficient to form a river of any magnitude. 

Botany. — The only thing worth mentioning under this head 
is, that the rare plant Eriocaulon septangulare is found in a lake 
near Loch-in-daal. 

11, — Civil History. 

Land-owners. — Lord Macdonald is sole proprietor of the parish. 

Ancient and Modern Buildings. — The only ancient buildings 
deserving of any notice are two, viz. Dun-scaich, on the west side 
of the parish, and the Castle of Knock, on the east. Both, I be- 
lieve, were the residences of the Barons of Sleat at a very remote 
period. Dun-scaich is the more extensive building ; and, from the 
remains f a prison and a draw-well, it must have been a place of 
considerable strength. 

The only mansion-house is Lord Macdonald's castle at Arma- 
dale. It is a modern Gothic building, erected about twenty- 
five years ago, after a design by Gillespie Graham, Esq. The 
lobby and staircase, from the correctness -of architecture, and ele- 
gance of finish, are universally admired. The staircase windo w 
contains an elegant portrait of Somerled, Lord of the Isles, the 
founder of the family, in full Highland costume, done in stained 
glass by Egginton of Birmingham. This window gives the lobby 
and staircase a splendid and dignified appearance. The public 
rooms are all handsome and well proportioned. 

Parochial Registers. — The only register belonging to the pa- 
rish is that of births and marriages, commencing in 1813, and re- 
gularly kept since that period. 

III. — Population. 

In the year 1755 the population amounted to 1250. When 
the former Statistical Account was written, the number of souls 
was 1788. In 1821, it amounted to 2237 ; in 1831, to 275G ; 
and in 1837 it had increased to 3000. 

Character of the People. — If the absence of crime be taken as a 
test by which to judge of the character of a population, the people 
of Sleat will stand high. Interference on the part of the police of 
the country among them is unknown. Since my connection with 
the parish, fourteen years ago, I recollect only one case of 
theft, and the person then accused was evidently imbecile. The 
inhabitants may be characterized as sober and active; but it must 
be admitted that they want that persevering industry which is ne- 



ISLAND OF SKYE SLEAT. 319 

cessary to improve their condition. The able-bodied among them, 
after their potatoes are planted in the end of spring, go to the south 
in search of employment. They return again at Martinmas; and 
their earnings go to pay the landlord's rents, and to support the 
weaker members of their families. The winter is almost altogether 
spent in idleness. There is no demand for labour in the parish, and 
hence there is only occasional exertion on the part of the people. 
As the summer's earnings are spent during the winter, there is sel- 
dom or never a fund laid up for sickness or old age ; and when either 
of these comes, there is great poverty and privation. Their clothing 
consists of cloth of their own manufacture. This they find fitter to 
resist the weather, than any manufactured in the south. Their food 
consists principally of potatoes. Oatmeal is a luxury among them, 
and butcher-meat is seldom tasted. Their poverty arises very 
much from over-population. There are 500 families in the parish. 
Of these only 6 pay upwards of L.50 yearly rent ; 269 pay from L.IO 
to 7s. 6d. per annum ; and there are 225 families, comprising up- 
wards of 1 100 individuals, located in different parts of the parish, 
who pay no rents, deriving their subsistence from small por- 
tions of land given them by the rent-payers for raising potatoes. 
These are a burden to the proprietor, inasmuch as they destroy 
the land in cutting fuel and turf ; and are a grievous burden 
to the inhabitants generally, from the extent of pauperism prevail- 
ing among them. An adequate correction for such an evil is dif- 
ficult to be found. Their abject poverty stands in the way of any 
stimulus that may be applied for enabling them to better their 
condition ; and if matters are left as they are, there will very soon be 
such a mass of pauperism as it is alarming to contemplate. The 
most efficient remedy appears to be an extensive and well-regulated 
emigration. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish consists of 1335 acres arable ; 3956 acres green pas- 
ture ; 18,265 acres hill pasture ; and 500 acres wood. 

I believe the rental of the parish is about L.2400. 

Husbandry. — The management of the land depends very much 
on the tenant. The tacksmen in the parish farm their arable lands 
regularly,- — have a rotation of crops, — and pay great attention to 
the rearing of their sheep and cattle stocks. The case is different 
with the crofters. Their principal object is to raise potatoes; and, 
as they use little manure except sea-weed, the quality of the root is 
bad, and the ground impoverished. Their cattle and sheep stocks 



320 



INVEllNESS-SHIRE. 



are also mismanaged. They keep nearly a double stock on their 
hill pastures ; hence the animals are stinted in their growth, and 
are gerierally worth little. Were a moderate stock kept, and their 
arable lands properly tilled, I have no doubt the people's comfort 
would be materially improved. 

Leases. — The five tacksmen in the parish alone possess leases, 
the duration of which is generally fifteen years. The others are 
all tenants at will. 

Improvements. — Extensive improvements have been made on 
Lord Macdonald's farm of Armadale. Much land has been re- 
claimed, and the fields are regularly divided by ditches and hedges. 
Planting has been carried on there also on an extensive scale, and the 
parish has now the advantage of being able, from thinnings of wood, 
to supply itself with such timber as is required for boat-building 
and agricultural purposes, — an advantage it possesses over the other 
parishes in the island. Among some who have made improve- 
ments in the parish, Mr Elder of Knock, and late of Isleornsay, 
is conspicuous. The extensive fields of luxuriant and healthy 
pasture, both at Isleornsay and Knock, bear ample testimony 
to his industry, judgment, and enterprise, and form a strong 
contrast to the poor crops and bare pastures on the farms around 
him. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are no towns or villages in the parish. 

Means of Communication. — A parliamentary road runs through 
the parish, opening the communication from Armadale to Broad- 
ford, a distance of sixteen miles. There are also district roads 
connecting different parts of the parish. A steam-boat from 
Glasgow to Portree calls once a week in summer, and once in 
three weeks in winter. Thus an easy access is opened by sea and 
land to other parts. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated at Kilmore about 
the middle of the parish. It is an old building, and has the date 
] 631 marked on it. It has been lately repaired, and is seated for 
nearly 500. 

Manse, 8fc. — The manse was built about thirty years ago, and is 
a handsome building, near to the church. The glebe is arable, and 
may be of the yearly value of L.6. The teinds amount to L.62, 
7s. 4d. per annum. The balance of stipend is made up from the 
Exchequer allowance. There are 5 families Dissenters, viz. 3 Ro- 
man Catholics, and 2 Baptists. The people, for the most part, 



ISLAND OF SKYE SLEAT. 



321 



are regular in attending on religious ordinances. Many come to 
church in winter, a distance of five and six miles. The averaae 
number of communicants is '200. 

Education. — There are three endowed schools in the parish : viz. 
the parochial school, near the church — an Assembly school at 
Tormore, in the southern part of the parish, and one from the So- 
ciety in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge. These 
three schools have suitable houses for their accommodation. A 
school from the Gaelic School Society has been established at 
the ferry of Kyle-rhea, opposite to Gienelg. Another schoo 
is wanted at Isleornsay, to place the means of education within 
easy reach of all the inhabitants. A large proportion of the old 
people are unable to read or write ; but they all seem desirous that 
their children should be educated. 

Poor and- Parochial Funds. — When the season is good and the 
crops plentiful, the poor having more or less crop, do not require 
the same extent of aid as in bad seasons. During the destitu- 
tion of 1837, nearly 1500 required aid ; but in ordinary years, 
about 200 are left to depend more or less on others. The ave- 
rage amount of the collections from 1826 to 1836 was L. 10 
a-year. Since that period, owing to the landlord's absence from 
the parish, and other causes, the collections became merely nomi- 
nal, so that in 1836 the kirk-session came to the resolution of 
having no stated collection. The poor are now supported by the 
charity of their neighbours. All the rent-payers consider it a duty 
to appropriate a certain portion of their potatoes and corn for the 
poor, and in this way their wants have been hitherto supplied. 
When a case of extraordinary distress occurs, an occasional col- 
lection is made for its relief. This plan for the support of the poor 
may answer well in good seasons. But should a bad season come, 
and the crops fail, similar destitution to what took place in 1837 
must recur. To afford to the poor the aid of food and clothing 
which their destitution requires, a permanent fund must be provid- 
ed, and this can only be secured by an assessment ; but, in the cir- 
cumstances of the parish from over-population, audits consequent 
poverty, this would introduce such evils, that other means must 
fail before it be resorted to. At present, the situation of the 
people is gradually but surely tending to make an assessment ne- 
cessary. 

-FMt/.~The only fuel is turf, which is good and abundant.

INVEIINESS-SIIIIIE. 



Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was written, various im- 
provements have taken place in the parish. Excellent roads have 
been opened — extensive plantations have been made — and a large 
extent of land reclaimed. Steam-boats ply regularly, and facili- 
ties are afforded for the introduction of the comforts of civilized life. 
But no permanent improvement has taken place in the circum- 
stances of the people generally. Population has increased from 
1788 to 3000, and lands which were then possessed by labour- 
ing tenants are now converted to sheep-farms. This has redu- 
ced the people's means of support. There are no manufactures, 
and, as they depend on land exclusively for their subsistence, an 
extent of poverty prevails among them now, to which formerly 
they were strangers. As yet, however, crime is unknown among 
them. A high degree of moral feeling has hitherto restrained 
them ; but it is to be feared that grinding poverty will break down 
this check, and introduce crimes at which they hitherto have shud- 
dered.

PRESBYTERY OF SKYE, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. ARCHIBALD CLERK, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural Histoiiy. 
Name. — Duirinish, or more properly Durinish, is by some 
resolved into two words of Scandinavian origin, signifying the pro- 
montory of Deer ; but more probably, the name is derived from 
the Gaelic Dur, which, like the Latin Duriis, signifies hard or 
rocky, and Innis, a very common Celtic term, signifying indiffer- 
ently promontory or island. Dur-innis in the case before us, then, 
signifies the rocky promontory; a designation which every one ac- 
quainted with the parish will acknowledge to he a very appropriate 
one, — as it forms a large .promontory, singularly rocky and bold. 
This parish is, both in conversation and in writing, sometimes 
designated Kilmuir, a corruption of Cill-Mliuire, i. e. a place con- 



ISLAND OF SKYR 



DUIRINISH. 



323 



secrated to the Virgin Mary ; but Durinish is the name by which 
it is generally known. 

Extent. — The extreme length of the parish from Unish to 
Idrigil is 19 miles ; breadth, from Vater stein to Lynedale, 16 
miles. Its extent in square miles is about 100. But these dis- 
tances convey no idea of the difficulty of traversing it, it being in- 
tersected by arms of the sea, by hills and morasses, which render 
travelling through it a very arduous task. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded on the west by what is called 
the Minch, the channel which separates Skye from the Outer 
Hebrides ; on the north and north-east, by Loch Grieshernish, or 
Arnizort, a branch of Lock Snizort except that a small strip of 
land to the east of this loch belongs to it ; on the south and 
south-east, by Loch Bracadale, and one of its branches called 
Loch Carroy, and on the east partly by the parish of Snizort, and 
partly by that of Bracadale. 

Figure. — The form of the parish is as irregular as may well 
be conceived, and defies all power of minute description. On a 
general view, it presents the appearance of a large promontory, or 
rather peninsula, separated from the rest of Skye by a neck of 
low moorish land, about four miles in breadth, stretching from 
Loch Carroy to Loch Grieshernish already noticed. But this penin- 
sula is first subdivided by Loch Follart, or Loch Dunvegan, which, 
branching off the Minch, stretches due south to within less than 
two miles of Loch Carroy. These two large subdivisions are again 
cut up by Loch Bay and Loch Poltiel, each of which is near two 
miles hi length, and by so many creeks and inlets as would be te- 
dious to enumerate. Of the two larger divisions, the western one 
is known as Duirinish proper, while the northern portion of the 
east one is called Vaternish or Waternish, and forms a separate 
parish quoad sacra, being one of the recent Parliamentary erections. 

Mountains, Sfc. — The only mountains in the parish deserving 
the name, are two which are situated in the western peninsula, and 
known to the country people as the Greater and Lesser Helvel 
probably a corruption of sealbh mheall, the charmed or fortunate 
hill ; and evidently of the same derivation with Helvellyn in 
Wales. These rise each to the height of 1700 feet, and are re- 
markable for the verdure of their surface, and the regularity of 
their slope, while their summits are perfectly level, This last 
peculiarity has procured for them, especially among sailors, the 
name of Macleod's Tables; and I believe that they are more 



324 



iNVERNESS-SHlRE. 



completely tabular in their forms than any other mountains of 
equal size in Scotland. From the Larger Helvel, a range of 
elevated hilly ground extends to the north, and terminates in 
Dunvegan or Galtrigil Head, a singularly bold and precipitous 
headland, which is upwards of 300 feet in perpendicular height ; 
while, from the Lesser Helvel, a similar range strikes olF to the 
south, ending in the Points of Idrigil and Waterstein, the cliffs 
of the former of which rise abruptly from the sea to the height of 
400 feet ; those of the latter to near 600. With the exception 
of the headland of Tallisker in the neighbouring parish of Bra- 
cadale, these two are by far the highest and grandest in the coun- 
try, A few hundred yards from the Point of Idrigil are to be 
seen three very remarkable basaltic pillars, rising perpendicularly 
out of the sea ; the highest of which is about 200 feet in height, 
the other two about 100. These pillars are generally known as 
Macleod's Maidens ; but the country people designate them as a 
mother and her two daughters, calling the matron Nic Cleosgeir 
Mhor. There was at one time a fourth pillar, but it yielded to 
the action of the storms and waves, and has now disappeared in 
the deep. They certainly present at a distance no indistinct re- 
semblance to gigantic females clad in cloaks and hoods, while 
the superior size of one of them entitles her at least to the honour 
of being thought the eldest. Sir Walter Scott compares them 
to the Norwegian Riders of the storm, or chusers of the slain ; 
and the tradition which says that the mother is constantly engaged 
in weaving a web of cloth which one of the daughters is occupied 
in fulling or thickening, is probably of Scandinavian origin. I 
have not learned what is the office of the third, nor, with the ex- 
ception of the above, could I gather any legend connected with 
them. 

There are two other series of hills in the parish ; but as they 
neither rise to any considerable height, nor have anything pecu- 
liar in their formation, they do not merit a particular description. 

The surface of the ground is generally sloping, and the few 
tracts of level land which are to be met with consist almost wholly 
of deep peat moss. 

There is one valley, called Glendale, about two miles in length, 
which stretches from the head of Loch Poltiel in a southerly di- 
rection, until it reaches near the base of the Smaller Helvel. Its 
breadth is from half a mile to three-quarters of a mile ; its sides 
sloping gradually, and covered with very rich pasture. It is di- 



ISLAND OF SKYE — DUIRINISII.- 325 

vided by a considerable stream, here called the Jmhainn Mhor, 
the Large River; a title which, however, it scarcely deserves to 
enjoy. There are neither streams nor valleys in any other por- 
tion of the parish worthy of mention. 

Caves, 4c- — There are some caves, and an immense nnmber of 
caverns and hollows in the rocks along the coast, formed evidently 
by the action of the waves on the barrier which opposed their 
progress. Indeed, the coast for several miles presents the ap- 
pearance of an almost endless variety of Gothic arches, some of 
them only a few feet in height, others rising as high as fifty or sixty 
feet; some regular and symmetrical, according to the strictest rules 
of art ; while others look as if the builder in constructing them 
had taxed his powers to heap together all that was grotesque and 
incongruous. Some of these caves are above tide-mark, but into 
many of them the sea rushes with a deep and hollow murmur, 
which is most solemn and awe-inspiring. One of them, called 
Uamh a Choinnleir, or the Cave of the Candlestick, possibly be- 
cause on account of its darkness, it requires to be entered with a 
candle, is near 100 feet in length, about 50 feet in height, and 
presents a scene of gloomy grandeur-well worth the visitino-. An- 
other which I examined is 120 feet in length, 40 feet in Tieio-ht, 
and about 10 in breadth. A third, called Idrigil Cave, which is 
but small in comparison with those now mentioned, has yet a me- 
lancholy interest attached to it, as having been for some time one 
of the many dismal prisons in which the unfortunate and ill-used 
Lady Grange was confined. It is now frequently resorted to as 
a dwelling by the fishermen who follow their trade on the coast. 
They here hang up their nets to dry, cure their fish, cook their 
victuals, and sleep soundly on the dry sand with which part of the 
cave is strewn. 

It is somewhat singular regarding these caves, that while there 
is water oozing through most of them, there is no stalactitic for- 
mation, no calcareous accretion of any kind to be found in them. 
The basaltic rock appears black and bare in all of them. 

Coast— The coast, owing to the numerous arms of the sea, al- 
ready adverted to, is no less than 70 miles in extent. It presents 
many headlands of stupendous height, and forming scenes of 
singular wildness and magnificence. Within the lochs, however, 
the ground shelves down with a moderate declivity, and affords a 
great variety of commodious landing-places. Lochs Dunvegan 
and Grieshernish form safe roadsteads for vessels of the largest

INVERNESS-SIIIIIE. 



size, from whatever quarter the wind may blow, and Loch Bay, 
Locli Poltiei, and Loch Carroy, though more exposed, alford good 
anchorage in ordinary weather. A small branch of Loch Carroy, 
called Pol Roag, forms an anchorage as safe as can be imagined ; 
but, owing to the narrowness of the entrance, it is adapted to small 
craft only. 

The high water line is almost everywhere composed of a rocky 
ledge, but between this and low water-mark, a beach is found, ge- 
nerally consisting of gravel and large stones, sometimes of sand, 
and in a few instances of mud. 

Islands. — There is a number of small islands belonging to the 
parish, but none of them is inhabited except one, called Eilean 
Isa, " the island of Jesus," which is only a few miles in circumfe- 
rence ; yet, from its fertility, supports fourteen or fifteen families in 
considerable comfort. 

Meteor ology.-\t is well known that along all the Western Isles 
a great quantity of rain falls annually. Skye, owing to local causes, 
the height of its mountains and headlands, receives more than its 
due proportion of this quantity. The island of Uist, though lying 
further west, yet being much lower, enjoys a comparatively dry 
climate, especially as regards the partial and generally heavy 
showers of summer. Clouds loaded with the vapours of the At- 
lantic pass over it unbroken ; but, when dashed against the lofty 
hills of Skye, discharge their contents in torrents. 

The winters are very boisterous, but far from being cold. In 
this parish snow seldom lies above a few days, except on the 
top of the Helvels, and very little ice is formed. 

Climate.— climate, though moist, is far from being un- 
healthy. On the contrary, it is highly salubrious. While so 
much rain falls, there are no stagnant pools or marshes to retain 
or corrupt it, and the vicinity of the sea tends to preserve an equa- 
ble temperature, which is highly conducive to health. Some faUil 
diseases, frequent in other places, are unknown or nearly so here ; 
among which may be mentioned that fatal scourge of Britain ge- 
nerally, consumption. The most prevalent complaints are, dys- 
pepsia, dysentery, slow fevers, and cutaneous diseases, which are 
almost entirely confined to the humbler classes, and arise from 
lowness of diet, and want of attention to cleanliness. There is 
one very loathsome disease, commonly called the seveiis or sihhcns, 
which is very prevalent here ; but whether it be indigenous or im- 
ported, I have not been able to learn. 



ISLAND OK SKYE DUIRINISH. 327 

It is worthy of mention, that, while vaccination is generally ne- 
glected, those of the people who remain at home, with few excep- 
tions, escape the ravages of small-pox ; but those who go to the 
south or low country are almost universally attacked by it, and 
many of them fall victims to it. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geology of the parish is remark- 
ably uniform, being almost entirely of the trap formation. Hori- 
zontal beds of amorphous basalt and trap tuff are surmounted by 
columnar basalt, the angles of which are, however, seldom regu- 
lar or well defined. It may be said to show only an incipient ten- 
dency to crystallization. These beds are very frequently intersect- 
ed by veins or dikes of basalt, harder, darker, and more splintery 
than that of which the columns are composed. 

Minerals. — The simple minerals imbedded are zeolites of every 
variety and in great abundance ; steatite likewise abundant, espe- 
cially about Dunvegan ; augite and olivine more rarely. 

Beds of limestone occur in two localities, \st, at Waterstein or 
Vaterstein, in a very remarkable situation, — the immensely high 
cliffs already noticed, overhanging the sea ; and 2/, more exten- 
sively at Loch Bay, in the district of Vaternish. In this latter lo- 
cality, the limestone contains numerous fossil shells, and in some 
instances is entirely composed of them. They seem all to belong- 
to a comparatively recent era, — a fact which might be easily as- 
certained by a skilful geologist, as they are very little changed 
from their original state. One of these Beds of shelly limestone 
lies under an immense cliff of basalt, which is near 200 feet in 
height. Veins of sandstone occur at Loch Bay, along with the 
limestone, and both here and at Vaterstein seams of coal are to 
be met with. The sandstone is very soft and friable, consequent- 
ly utterly unfit for the purposes of building. The coal, which is 
hard and brittle, resembling cannel-coal, though scarcely so lus- 
trous, is to be found in seams of only a few inches in thickness. 
Repeated attempts have been made to discover a workable seam ; 
but they failed ; and it is evident, from the geological formation of 
the surrounding district, that all such attempts must end in disap- 
pointment. 

Soils.— r'T\\e soils are generally peat moss, or a mixture of peat 
moss and decomposed trap. There are a few tracts of clayey soil 
to be met with, and still fewer of gravelly ; but no instance of 
sandy soil occurs. 

Zoology and Botany. — Very little can be said on these heads.

1NVERNESS-5HIRE. 



The quadrupeds common on the mainland of Scotland, are all to 
be found here, except the hare, mole, and polecat, which are not 
to be met with in Skye. Hares have been introduced once or 
twice; but they very speedily disappeared, whether owing to the 
jealousy of those who feed them, but have not the privilege of 
shooting them, or to the unsheltered nature of the country, I have 
not the means of ascertaining. The other two species of animals 
have, I believe, been never seen in the island,: — a fact which the 
inhabitants have no cause to regret. 

Of fishes, the herring is undoubtedly the most important in an 
economical point of view, next to which come the cod and ling, 
large quantities of which are annually caught along the shores, — 
quantities capable of very considerable increase, were the inhabit- 
ants active or enterprising fishers. Turbot, mackerel, skate, had- 
dock, and flounder, are likewise to be met with, but not in large 
numbers. Shell-fish is very abundant whenever the beach is 
smooth, and is much prized by the poorest of the people, to many 
of whom it affords sustenance in the latter end of summer, when, 
generally, every other provision fails. 

It is worthy of remark regarding the herring, that they are 
found of very different qualities in the different lochs that indent the 
parish, and that they are almost always found of the same quality 
and appearance in the same loch. This would seem to warrant 
the belief, that herrings, like salmon, have peculiar localities to 
which they regularly resort. 

BotauTj. — The botany of the parish is, like its geology, very 
uniform, and consequently uninteresting. No rare plant has been 
discovered in it except the Mimulus luteiis, an American plant, 
which is to be found in a ditch close by the inn at Dunvegan ; 
and it'is supposed, though there is no certain proof of this, that it 
is not indigenous to Duirinish, but has been thrown out of some 
o-arden into its present situation. 

There is one culinary vegetable — the cabbage, which thrives 
better in this parish, I believe, than anywhere else in Scotland. 
The Glendale Cahbarje is known and sought after not only through- 
out all Skye, but likewise in many places on the mainland ; and 
its immense size, combined with its delicacy of flavour, entitles it to 
the pre-eminence which it has attained. The seed is said to have 
been obtained from a foreign vessel which was wrecked at the foot 
of Glendale many years ago. Whether it be a distinct species I 
am not able to determine.

The district is entirely destitute of natural wood, — some scraggy 
hazel and stunted birch bushes to be met with in a few localities, 
not deserving the name. It is evident from the remains of trees 
found in the peat mosses, that the country was not always equally 
bare ; but as these remains are neither very numerous nor of a 
large size, it may be concluded that it has not been well-wooded for 
many ages back. Until about sixty years ago, there seem to have 
been no attempts made by art to remedy the deficiency of nature. 
Butaboutthat time, General Macleod of Macleod commenced plant- 
ing around his castle of Dunvegan; and his example has been fol- 
lowed by his two successors, so that now there is an extensive and 
thriving plantation, where formerly all was bleak and bare. The 
late Mr Macdonald of Lynedale, about fifty years ago, likewise 
planted to some extent around his own dwelling, where now trees of 
some size are to be seen. Mr Macleod of Orbost, and Mr Gumming 
of Grieshernish have followed the example set to them. Their 
houses will soon be completely sheltered, as they are already or- 
namented by wood of their own rearing. But, with these excep- 
tions, nothing has been done to redeem the district from its na- 
turally naked character. 

The larch is decidedly the most congenial tree to the soil and 
climate of this place ; but a great variety of other trees, such as 
oak, ash, plane, beech, alder, and birch, are found to thrive pretty 
well, notwithstanding the violence of the sea-blast to which they 
are constantly exposed. Scotch fir has not succeeded well, though 
tried more than once. 

II. — Civil History. 
Tradition speaks of some sanguinary battles fought between 
the Macleods and the Claim Raonniiill or Macdonalds of Uist, 
who made repeated attempts either to possess themselves of the 
country, or at least to plunder and ravage it. The fiercest and 
bloodiest of these battles was fought at a place called Ardmore, 
in the district of Vaternish, on the beach below the old church 
of Trumpan. Many of the Macleods were assembled in this 
church, when the enemy came suddenly upon them, surrounded 
the building, set fire to it, and destroyed all the worshippers ; one 
woman alone excepted, who made her escape during the confu- 
sion of the fray. This barbarous and sacrilegious work, however, 
did not pass unrevenged. The inhabitants of other parts of the 
country had observed the boats of their foe. The beacon-lights 
and Crois Tar a fiery-cross soon brought together men who were 

INVERNESS. Y 



330 



INVERNRSS-SHIUE. 



accustomed lo war, and delighted in it. 'I'lie smoke and flames 
of their church, which were visible from many parts of the parish, 
caused them to redouble their speed ; and before the Macdonalds 
had regained their vessels, they were beset by the infuriated 
Macleods, who took full revenge for the slaughter of their friends. 
The booty was recovered, and the greater number of the Mac- 
donalds left dead on the shore. The burial given by the Mac- 
leods to those of their enemies who fell on this occasion, was dif- 
ferent from that which the Highlanders generally gave to brave 
opponents. The bodies, it is said, were ranged in a line by the 
side of a stone wall which stood near the scene of combat, and 
the wall thrown down upon them. Hence the battle is still known 
as Blar Milleadh Gdraidh, {i. e. the battle of the destruction of 
the dike. Whether this be or be not a correct account of the 
origin of the name, it is very certain that a deadly conflict did 
take place on the spot pointed out as the battle-field of Milleadh 
Gdraidh ; for large quantities of human bones are still to be seen 
there, on turning over some loose stones by which the ground is 
covered. The smothering of the Macdonalds by the Macleods 
in the Cave of Eigg, while a barbarous, was not an inappropriate 
retaliation for the work at Waternish. 

There are indistinct accounts preserved of another battle fought 
by these hostile clans, known as Bldr Bhatternish, the battle of 
Vaternish. There the Macleods lost many men, and were on 
the point of being completely discomfited, when the celebrated 
Fairy Flag or enchanted banner of their chief was unfurled, 
which immediately this being one of its three miraculous pro- 
perties multiplied the number of the Macleods threefold, or 
rather made their enemies believe that they were so multiplied. 
The Macdonalds, seeing themselves beset by so large and unlooked 
for a host, were seized with a sudden panic, sought safety in flight, 
and were completely routed. So says tradition ; and there are 
some who still give implicit credence to its reports, however absurd 
they be. 

Famili/ of Macleod.~The Macleods obtained peaceable pos- 
session of this parish in the tenth century, through the marriage 
of the first Tormoid, or Norman of the name, with the only daugh- 
ter of MacRailt, the original possessor of the soil ; and, despite 
the repeated attempts which have been made by their enemies to 
deprive them of it, and of the changes which time usually produces 
in families, they still retain possession of all of it, except what has 

4 



ISLAND OF SKYK DUIRINISTI. 



been voluntarily alienated.. The chief historical interest of the 
parish may be said, indeed, to rest on the fact, that in it is situated 
the ]rincipal stronghold and residence of this very ancient family ; 
and it may not be foreign to such an account as the present, to 
say a few words regarding their early history. 

In a statement, professing to be drawn from the chronicles of 
Iceland, it is said, that several Norwegian chiefs, tired of the ty- 
ranny of Harold Harfinger their king, abandoned his dominions, 
and betook themselves to the sea in quest of a habitation where 
they might enjoy liberty. They landed on the Pharo Islands, 
which they found uninhabited, and of which they took immediate 
possession. After this they subdued Orkney and Shetland, the 
Isle of Man, and all the Hebrides, as well as several tracts on the 
mainland, from Caithness to the Mull of Cantyre. These scat- 
tered possessions were formed into two principalities, or rather a 
kingdom, and an earldom, — the seat of the former being in the 
Isle of Man, — that of the latter in Orkney. Both the King of 
Man and the Earl of Orkney exercised for a time an independent 
sway ; but they were soon found out by their old master, who com- 
pelled them again to acknowledge his supremacy, — at least nomi- 
nally. These islands then continued attached to the Crown of 
Norway until the battle of Largs in 1261, when Magnus, son of 
King Haco, surrendered them to Scotland ; guaranteeing, how- 
ever, to the Norwegian settlers all the rights and privileges which 
they formerly possessed. 

The first Earl of Orkney was Torf-Einar, son of Rognvallar 
Earl of Maeria, in Norway, and brother to the famous Rolf- 
Gaunger, or RoUo the Dane, the founder of the Duchy of Nor- 
mandy. One of his descendants, Thorfinn, left a numerous fa- 
mily of sons, who quarrelled about the paternal inheritance, ap- 
pealed to arras, and deluged the island with blood. Liot or Leod 
as it is now written by us, one of the number, apparently more 
peaceably disposed than his brothers, left the scene of contest, and 
settled himself in the Island of Lewis, — the Gaelic name of which, 
Leodhas, signifies the habitation of Leod. He was the common 
ancestor of the numerous and powerful clan of Macleod, which 
became divided into two main branches, springing respectively from 
his sons, Tormoid, and Torgil or Torquil. From Tormoid is de- 
scended the chief of the Macleods of Skye, sometimes styled of 
Harris, of Dunvegan, of Macleod. From Torquil are descended 
the Macleods of Lewis, now represented, though not in the direct

INVERNESS-SIIIRR. 



male line, which has long ago become extinct, hy Macleod of 
Raasay. They at one time had extensive possessions and swav ; 
but forfeited the greater portion of their lands in the reign of 
James VI. The Macleods of Dunvegan have been more fortunate, 
and have retained, as already observed, through the lapse of many 
ages, and through various vicissitudes of fortune, all their original 
possessions, except what they voluntarily disposed of. 

There is a striking proof of the complete subjugation of the 
Island of Skye to the Norwegian invaders in the fact, that very 
many of the proper names still used in it are traceable to a Norse 
origin. The inhabitants have Tormoid, Harold, Olaus, and Mag- 
nus, — all Norwegian names, still common among them. But 
it is much more remarkable than this, that nearly every farm, 
every hill, every stream, has a Norwegian appellation, while, at the 
same time, not the remotest trace of Norse can be discovered in 
any part of the language of the country, except the proper names. 
The Gaelic spoken throughout the island is remarkably pure, and 
free of foreign admixture. It is worthy of observation at the same 
time, that, while in this country, where the Celts were subdued, 
but from which they were never expelled, they adopted foreign 
names to designate almost all the places; in the south again, from 
which they migrated, or were expelled ages ago, where now not a 
word of their language is spoken, yet places are almost universally 
designated by names which they have left behind them, that is, by 
Celtic names. This, however, is not the place where to follow 
out the conclusions which might be drawn from such facts. 

The descendants of Leod still retain their Scandinavian names;- 
but, in every other respect, they have long ago conformed to the 
habits of the Celtic tribes among which they dwelt, especially in 
regard to the clan or patriarchal system of government which pre- 
vailed among the Scotch and Irish Celts, but was utterly unknown 
among the branches of the great Gothic family. 

Notwithstanding that the Macleods have had their principal 
residence in this parish for many centuries, none of the heads 
of the family have been interred in it, their burial-place being at 
Rodil, in Harris, except the late chief, who ordered his remains 
to be buried on his own estate. There is now a plain but taste- 
ful monument erected over them bv his successor, in the church- 
yard of Duirinish. 

In the same burying-place, there is an obelisk erected by the 
noted Simon Lord Lovat on the grave of his father, who died at

333 



Dunvegan, and was a near relation of the Macleod family. It is 
now, however, considerably decayed, and threatens soon to crum- 
ble into ruins except it be repaired. 

Lady Grange. — There are the ruins of two religious houses to 
be seen in the parish, — one in the valley of Glendale, the other 
at Trumpan, in the district of Vaternish. The history of both 
seems to be completely lost. In the latter place is interred the 
ill-fated Lady Grange, whose singular history accords better 
with the dark ages of barbarism .than with the general character 
of the times in which she lived and died. 

Some very romantic and fabulous accounts have been given of 
this lady's sufferings ; but the following particulars have been 
stated to us on authority which deserves regard. She was the 
daughter of Cheisly of Dairy, a man of violent passions, whose 
temper she unfortunately for herself inherited. She became the 
wife of Mr Erskine of Grange, who was made a Lord of Session, 
in 1707, by the title of Lord Grange, and was Lord Justice- Clerk 
during the latter years of Queen Anne's reign. He was brother 
to the Earl of Mar, who headed the ill-conducted Rebellion of 
1715 against the House of Hanover; and though he did not 
openly join the rebels, yet he aided them with his counsel and 
wealth. His house was a frequent rendezvous to the disaffected 
gentry and nobility ; and his wife, who was not privy to the con- 
spiracy, soon became suspicious of such frequent and numerous 
meetings under her roof. With the curiosity natural to her sex, 
she resolved to possess herself of the secret of their proceedings, 
and accomplished her object by hiding herself under a sofa during 
one of the conferences. She was warmly attached to the reign- 
ing family. Her love to Lord Grange, who treated her with much 
harshness and unkindness, was by no means deep or cordiaL A 
quarrel — no rare occurrence — took place between them, when she 
threatened to revenge herself by disclosing his traitorous purposes 
to the Government under which he lived. He knew her violence 
and her resolution too well to doubt of her fulfilling her pro- 
mise ; and seeing that his own safety and that of all his accom- 
plices were at stake, he instantly called a meeting of them, in or- 
der to devise a remedy against the danger which surrounded them. 
It was agreed at this conference that she should immediately be 
locked up ; that a report of her death should be spread abroad ; 
and that the Lairds of Macleod of Dunvegan, and Macdonald of 
Sleat, whose territories were very remote, should remove her, in 



334 



INVERNKSS-SHIRE. 



convenient time, to some secluded spot on their estates, where sire 
might be no more beard of. 

This barbarous plan was accordingly acted upon. News of her 
death were spread abroad; a mock funeral took place; while 
shortly afterwards she was forced away from her home and f'amilv, 
and, by devious routes, carried as far as Skye. She manifested 
her characteristic spirit in resisting those who were sent to carry 
her off; and so violent was the struggle, that" two of her teeth 
were knocked out before she was overpowered. But she was over- 
powered, and so dexterously was her abduction managed, that her 
friends knew nothing of her fate for several years, but believed 
that she was in reality dead; She was at first confined in the hut 
of some poor retainer of Macleod in Skye. When afraid that her 
residence might possibly become known, he sent her to Uist 
among Macdonald's followers. From thence she was banished to 
the remote island of St Kilda, where she remained for seven years. 
She was again taken back to Uist, and thence to Skye. While 
here a second time, she fell on a very ingenious expedient for com- 
municating with her friends. The poor people among whom 
she lived were accustomed to manufacture their wool into varn, 
which they annually sent in large clues to the Inverness market, 
for sale. Lady Grange acquired the art of spinning, and, having 
possessed herself of writing materials, she wrote a letter to one of 
her relatives, which she secretly enclosed in a clue of her own 
thread that was sent to the market along with others. The purchaser 
of the yarn forwarded the letter to its destination. Her friends 
were filled with indignation, and instantly applied to the Govern- 
meat for the liberation of the unfortunate lady from her captivitv. 
The Government sent a sloop of war to the coast of Skye, in or- 
der to make search for her ; but her gaolers were far too well ac- 
quainted with the many fastnesses and hiding-places of the coun- 
try to allow her to be thus taken. They immured her for some 
time in the cave of Idrigil already noticed, as being situated on 
the west of this parish. After this she was transferred to Uist, 
the person who had the management of the boat having beside 
him a rope, with a running noose at one end, and a heavy stone 
at the other, intending, according to his orders, to fix the noose 
round the prisoner's neck, and to consign her immediately to the 
deep, should the sloop of war come in sight during the passage. 
The passage was accomplished without such a tragical catastrophe 
as was contemplated. Lady Grange was confined for some time 



ISLAND OF SKYE — DUIUINISH. 



330 



longer in Uist, and again brought back to the district of Water- 
iiish, in this parish, where she ended her days. 

Her persecutors showed throughout the utmost anxiety to con- 
ceal her place of residence, knowing well the vengeance that 
would fall upon them if this were discovered. They resolved, 
tltat, if possible, even the grave should not bear witness against 
them ; for after her death they filled a coffin with sods, and, with 
ranch form, interred it in ihe church-yard of Duirinish, having 
invited many people to the funeral of the strange lady, while, 
meantime, her remains were secretly deposited in the church-yard 
of Trumpan, at Waternish.- There are few persons who have 
had so many funerals as Lady Grange ; and few, also, who have 
liad more cause to long for a real one, for that place " where the 
wicked cease to trouble, and the weary are at rest." 

On the recital of this story, it is impossible to avoid a feeling 
of surprise, that such an outrageous act of injustice and oppres- 
sion as that above, detailed should have been allowed, and that 
within less than a century back, to escape impunished by the 
Government of Great Britain. 

Jntiquilies. — First among the antiquities are to be noticed 
Duns or forts, of which there is a large number throughout the 
parish ; no fewer than fifteen ; all of them contiguous to the 
sea, and evidently at one time of very great strength. 'J'hey are 
generally of a circular shape, built of dry stone without lime or 
mortar ; frequently of such large blocks as would apparently re- 
quire the aid of powerful mechanical engines to raise them to the 
height at which they are found. Some of these forts had a wind- 
ing stair in the middle of the wall, ascending to the top of the 
building, and secret cells near the base. Others again seem to 
have contained no hiding-place, except recesses in the wall might 
be called so. The diameter of the largest which I have examined 
is about 40 feet; the thickness of the wall 12 feet. How these 
buildings were roofed, it is not easy to understand ; as it is gene- 
rally asserted that no wood was used for the purpose. 

There are also several tumuli or barrows to be met with through- 
out the parish, the two most remarkable of which are near the 
head of Loch Carroy. These, like the forts, are built on ele- 
vated ground, but are merely piles of loose stones. The two ads- 
verted to are known by the name of the Barpiinan. None of 
them has been opened up, but if opened up, they would, like 
others, be probably found to contain, in vaulted chambers, urns, 



33G 



INVERNESS-SHIRR. 



in which were deposited the ashes of once renowned, but now 
forgotten heroes. 

Subterranean dwellings, or earth-houses, of considerable size, 
are to be met with in the parish. These seem evidently to have 
been intended for hiding-places in times of danger. There is one 
of them situated on the farm of Vatten, having its entrance in 
the' face of a very precipitous bank, overhanging a deep ravine. 
This door, or more appropriately fox-hole, is completely covered 
over with heather and moss, so that its existence would never be 
suspected even after a minute examination of the bank. A passage 
about three feet in height, and near the same breadth, roofed by 
stones laid on as lintels, leads inwards to the distance of sixty or 
seventy feet, when it opens into what appears to have been a cen- 
tral room of considerable extent, arched over with stone, and from 
four to five feet in height. Off this room, several narrow galleries 
branch off in various directions, but to what extent has never been 
ascertained, as it is difficult and even dangerous to explore them 
until they be opened from above, and free air admitted into them. 
How these dwellings were ventilated, so as to be fit for the habi- 
tation of human beings, it is not easy now to discover, as for light 
they seem to have been utterly destitute of it, but in all probabi- 
i'y.the ingenuity of our rude ancestors discovered expedients, 
more simple, if not more effective, than those boasted of by our 
scientific age. There is another interesting specimen of these 
earth-houses on the farm of Clagan ; but it is neither so extensive 
nor so well constructed as that already adverted to. 

The only relics of antiquity excavated in the parish are some 
urns, apparently of Celtic manufacture, which were dug up about 
four years ago, in an old burial-place near the site of the parish 
church. These are composed of a very coarse reddish clay; but 
have several rude ornaments upon them, or rather are notched 
and scolloped throughout, and are much more elegant in shape 
than those generally known as Celtic urns, frequently are. One 
of them is in the possession of Macleod of Macleod. Another is 
believed to be in the Glaso-ow Hunterian Museum. All the rest 
were broken to pieces through the carelessness of the excavator, 
who was more anxious to fit the ground for bearing a crop of po- 
tatoes, than to bring to light any relics of antiquity which it con- 
tained. 

The Castle of Dunvegan is a very interesting monument of by- 
gone ages. The oldest part of it is said to have been built in the 



ISLAND OF &amp;KYE DUIRINISH. 



337 



ninth century. Another portion, consisting of a very high tower, 
was added by Alastair Crotach, or the Humphbacked, 400 years 
later. These two towers were conjoined, by means of a long low 
edifice, erected by Rory Mor, who was knighted in the days of 
James VI. Various additions have been made to it since, and 
the whole now forms a large mass of gray building, which, espe- 
cially at a distance, presents a very imposing appearance. It is 
situated on a precipitous rock, washed on one side by the sea ; on 
another, by a stream of some size ; on a third, it is guarded by 
what was at one time a moat, consisting of a natural hollow between 
the castle rock and another steep rock at some yards' distance ; 
on the fourth, the base is easily accessible, but owing to the height 
of the rock, and to its being surmounted everywhere by a wall with 
deep embrasures, even here it would be difficult to storm it, if at 
all well garrisoned. The entrance was of old from the sea side, 
by a very long, steep, and narrow stair ; but a new approach has 
been of late formed by throwing a bridge over the chasm already 
noticed, which now renders it of easy access. There is a small 
but very convenient harbour right before it, and a spring of excel- 
lent water rising on the top of the rock which forms the court- 
yard. These were the two circumstances which probably went 
farthest to determine the site of this fortalice when its foundation 
was laid. 

Among the ancient relics preserved in the castlo, the " Fairy 
flag," which, according to tradition, is the palladium of the Mac- 
leod family, the hinge on which their fortune turns, claims the first 
notice. 

This once celebrated banner, partly owing to the inroads of 
moths, and partly to the still liTore destructive inroads of curious 
visitors, many of whom carried off portions of it, is now dwindled 
down to very small dimensions. The fabric is of strong silk of a 
yellow colour. It is said to have been taken as a prize by one of 
the Macleods from a Saracen chief during the Crusades, and to 
possess three miraculous properties, — first, when displayed in bat- 
tle, to multiply the number of the Macleods threefold ; second, 
when spread on the nuptial bed, to make it productive ; and third, 

Sir Walter Scott, in his Diary of 1814, gives a minute account of the Castle of 
Dunyegan, which, notwithstanding his unrivalled power, and generally minute accu- 
racy in the description of old towers and castles, is more picturesque than correct ; 
and in describing the scene to be witnessed from the window of the " haunted 
chamber," he allows his imagination to deceive him completely, when he states that 
'• Macleod's Maidens," formed an interesting part of it. These pillars are not visible 
from any point within four miles of the castle.

to bring shoals of herring into Dun vegan loch. According to the 
original instructions given regarding the flag, it was to lc pub- 
hcly displayed only on three occasions: 1. when the clan was in 
immnieiit peril of being overthrown in battle, on which occasion 
the unfurling of it would turn the tide of victory completely in 
their favour ; 2. when the sole heir and hope of the family was 
near death, and then it would restore him to health ; and 3. when, 
through some cause not explained, the whole race of Macleod are 
to be on the verge of utter extinction, in which emergency the 
flag will save them ; but flag and flag-bearer are to be swept away 
by a whirlwind, and never more to be seen on earth. 

Laying Action aside, the " Fairy flag," according to the most 
]robable accounts, is a consecrated banner which once belonged to 
some order of the Knights Templars, and is undoubtedly of very 
high antiquity. 

There is also in the castle a very ancient cup or chalice, gene- 
rally known by the name of Nidi Glundubh, i. e. " Niel of the 
Black Knees," and said to have been taken by one of the Mac- 
leods along with other spoils, from an Irish chief, called Nial 
Glundubh many centuries ago. This cup is hollowed out of a so- 
lid block of very dark wood, stands on four silver legs, has a rim 
of silver about two inches in depth around the lips, and is orna- 
mented by several vertical stripes of silver, raised considerably, 
and wrought with great elegance, having numerous sockets in 
them for the reception of precious stones, a few of which still re- 
main. 

Rory Mors Horn. — A drinking cup, of much larger dimen- 
sions than that now adverted to, ought not to be passed over in 
silence, especially as it has found a place in one of the Bacchana- 
lian songs of Burns, and is briefly described by Sir Walter Scott. 
This is a very large horn, which was probably at one time worn 
by a long-horned kyloe ox, and is destitute of any .ornament ex- 

 Tile description given of tiiis chalice by Sir Walter Scott, in Ins Notes to tlie 
Lord of the Isles, and the drawing by Danieil, published in some of the miscel- 
lanies of the day, must have made its form and appearance familiar to many readers ; 
but we may here give the inscription which it bears, copied from Sir Walter's version 
of it. " Ufo Johannis Mich magni priiicipis de H.R. Mana Vich Siabia Magry- 
neil et sperat Domino Jhcsu dari clementiutii illoruin opera. Fecit anno Domini, 
993, Onili Oimi." The inscription is in Saxon black letter, and the numerals 93 
are perfectly distinct ; but it is very difficult, indeed, to discover the preceding 9, and 
from the facts that the Arabic numerals wore not at all known in Europe till 991, 
very little usod in Western Europe for a couple of centuries after this, and very 
rarely, if ever, used in the midst of Latin inscriptions in the middle ages, it nuist be 
doubtful whether the inscription should not be referred to a later period than the 
tenth century.

ceptabroiul rim of silver, chased and carved, around the edge. It 
is said to have been the favourite drinking cup of Rnari Mor, i. e. 
"Big Roderick," one of the Macleods already referred to : but 
from its containing three ordinary bottles, that is upwards of five 
English pints, it is probable that he did not often empty it. The 
quaffing otF its contents in claret is one of the ceremonies regu- 
larly gone through at the inauguration of the chief of Macleod. 
It is believed, however, that in modern days a piece of cork is on 
these occasions fixed in the horn, much nearer the top than the 
bottom. 

Bagpipe. — It is well known that the great bag-pipe, the in-- 
strument on which the national music of Scotland was chiefly 
played for so long a time, and which has still so striking an 
effect in rousing the martial spirit of the Highlanders, was cul- 
tivated with greater success by the Macrimmons, the hereditary 
pipers of the Macleods, than by any others in the Highlands. 
The name of Macrimmon, whether on fanciful or on conclusive 
ground we pretend not to say, has been derived from the fact of 
the first musician who bore the name having studied his profes- 
sion at Cremona in Italy. Certain it is that, what rarely happens, 
high musical talent as well as high moral principle and personal 
bravery, descended from father to son during many generations in 
the family of the Macrimmons. They became so celebrated that 
pupils were sent to them from all quarters of the Highlands, and 
one of the best certificates that a piper could possess was his hav- 
ing studied under the Macrimmons. . . Finding the number of pu- 
pils daily increasing, they at length opened a regular school or 
college for pipe music on the farm of Boreraig, opposite to Dun- 
vegan Castle, but separated from it by Loch FoUart. Here, so 
many years of study were prescribed, regular lessons were given 
out, certain periods for receiving the instructions of the mas- 
ter were fixed. The whole tuition was carried on as syste- 
matically as in any of our modern academies; and the names 
of some of the caves and knolls in the vicinity still point out 
the spots where the scholars used to practise, respectively on the 
chanter, the small pipe, and the Pioh vilwr, or large bagpipe, 
before exhibiting in presence of the master. Macleod endowed 
this school by granting the farm of Boreraig to it, and it is no 
longer ago than seventy years since the endowment was withdrawn. 
It was owing to the following cause : The farm had been originally 
given only during the pleasure of the proprietor. For many ages 



340 



INVERNESS-SHlllE. 



the grant was undisturbed : but when the value of land had risen 
to six or seven times what it was when the school was founded, 
Macleod very reasonably proposed to resume one-half of the farm, 
offering at the same time to Macrimmon, a free lease of the other 
half 171 perpetuiim ; but Macrimmon, indignant that his emoluments 
should be curtailed, resigned the whole form, and broke up his 
establishment, which has never been restored. 

The Macrimmons were well educated, intermarried with highly 
respectable families, and were universally regarded as vastly supe- 
rior to the common class of the country people. A son of the 
last family piper holds the rank of captain in the British army, 
and is said to inherit the musical talents of his race. There are 
a few of them still residing in this parish, but they are born of 
what was reckoned a very low marriage for Macrimmon, and they 
do not possess either the talents or respectability of their progenitors. 
A Macrimmon still acts as piper to Macleod, but he is not descend- 
ed of the Boreraig Macrimmons, who appear to have renounced 
their profession with their endowment. 

We know not vi'hether there were establishments similar to that 
of Boreraig in other parts of the Highlands ; but it certainly is to 
be regretted that it was dissolved, and also that we have not mi- 
nuter information as to the mode of training pursued by those who 
were universally acknowledged to be the first masters of bagpipe 
music. 

Eminent Persons. — Among the distinguished persons who were 
born in the parish, may be noticed Mary Macleod, or " Mairi 
Nighinn Alastair Ruaidh," i.e. Mary, the daughter of red-haired 
Alexander, who lived at Dunvegan about 200 years ago, and was 
a near relative of the Chief of Macleod. Her fame is confined 
by the narrow bounds of the Gaelic language ; but wherever it is 
known she is known, and admired as a poetess of the first order that 
has appeared in the Highlands for many ages back. Her concep- 
tions are remarkably vivid, and display much poetic fire ; her lan- 
guage is certainly very rich and varied ; and some of her composi- 
tions present instances, both of melting pathos and of rousing en- 
ergy, which might well bear comparison with many of the eulo- 
gized productions of modern days. 

She had a sister named Jean, who also composed songs and 
Ivrics ; but the higher fome of Mary has caused Jean to be com- 
paratively forgotten. 

Many individuals born in this pai'ish have distinguished them-

selves both in camp and council, especially in the former. Seve- 
ral might be named, of whom some are still living, who, born and 
reared in thatched'cottages, have attained the rank of generals, and 
the dignity of knighthood ; and have held highly responsible offices 
under the Government of the country; but we consider it foreign 
to the object of such an account as this to particularize them all. 

Land-oioners. — Of the land-owners of the parish, Macleod of 
Macleod, who possesses about one-half of the parish, is first o be 
mentioned. Major Macdonald of Waternish ranks next to him in 
extent of territory. Mr Macleod of Orbost ; Mr Macleod of St 
Kilda ; Mr Maclennan of Lyndale ; Mr Gumming of Griesher- 
nish ; Mrs Murray of Cushledder ; Mr Nicolson of Husabost ; 
and Mr Macdonald of Skeabost, compose the remainder. Nine 
in all. 

The only mansion-houses in the parish besides the Castle of 
Dunvegan, are those of Orbost, of Grieshernish, and of Waternish. 

Parochial Eef/isters. — The parochial registers have been yery 
much neglected ; there being none extending farther than thirty 
years back ; and session-records, it may be mentioned, were not 
kept with any degree of fulness before the commencement of the 
year 1840. 

III. — Population. 

The number of the inhabitants of the parish was given in 1811 
at 3227; in 1821, at 4174; in 1831, at 4765; and now it is 
closely bordering on 5000. 

We do not here see any remarkable increase of population ; 
but the number bears a vast disproportion to the resources of the 
parish ; and is far greater than the soil can support. This has been 
the case for many years back, — known and felt by every Intelligent 
person connected with the country; and thus it becomes interesting 
to inquire why such a state of things has been permitted by those 
who had it in their power to prevent it, and also how the popula- 
tion manage to subsist when the resources of the country are in- 
sufficient for them, and they have so little means of paying for 
imports from other countries. 

We answer the second question first, by stating that the people 
generally live on the poorest and scantiest fare, and many of ihem 
for a part of the year are supported mainly by shell-fish ; that, by 
sending their families annually to the south to labour there, the 
parents are, tog certain extent, upheld; and that, when every other 



INVFRNESS-SIIIRK. 



resource fails them, tliey live on their wealthier neifjfhbours, some 
by begging, and some by stealing. 

As to the first question, the answering it will occupy some time, 
and in considering it, we should remember, both that population 
has, in all circumstances, a strong natural tendency to multiply it- 
self, and that among an uneducated people this tendency always 
increases in the direct ratio of their poverty. We see, then, that 
in this island strong checks were necessary ta prevent an over- 
growth of population ; and we shall endeavour to state some of the 
causes which prevented and still prevent the application of these 
checks. 

In the olden time, the number of a chief's followers constituted 
his wealth, his power, and his safeguard. He then, for the most 
obvious reasons, gave the produce of his lands to the support of 
his retainers, and thus the country was capable of supporting a 
larger number than it is now, when so much of its produce is given 
as rent ; and if scarcity were felt in these lawless days, a few forays 
or creaghs from some other district soon supplied it. 

After the abolition of the clan system, and when rents, which 
were at first very light, came to be exacted, the wars in which 
Britain was constantly engaged for such a series of years, afforded 
an outlet, to a considerable extent, to the superabundant popula- 
tion ; and many of those who did not avail themselves of this out- 
let emigrated to the North American colonies ; thus showing 
much more enterprise than is manifested by their descendants. 

Later still, the manufacture of sea-ware into kelp afforded 
abundant employment to all the islanders who were not engaged 
in the tillage of the soil, and amply rewarded their labour, so as 
to enable them to purchase such necessaries and comforts of life 
as they needed. 

During these times, then, the pressure of the population on 
the means of subsistence was but slightly and seldom felt, and 
consequently there was little cause to check its growth. Now, 
however, matters are completely changed. There is no recruit- 
ing for war. The kelp trade is completely at an end. The people 
do not emigrate. There are no public works where they may 
find employment. They raise but a very inadequate quantity of 
food, and they are, as the natural result, in great want and dis- 
tress. Yet there are reasons which still induce some persons ra- 
ther to encourage than to stop the increase of the inhabitants. 
We may first mention, as what in some instances, though unin-

— DUIRINISH. 



33 



tentionally and indirectly, helps to aggravate the evil complained 
of, — the kindness of the proprietor of the soil. He sees his people 
increase too rapidly ; but they consider a separation from their 
native place the greatest of all earthly evils. While they can 
manage to procure a meal or two of potatoes in the day, they are 
contented, and implore permission to remain as they are. He 
can sympathize in their feelings of attachment to the place where 
they were born, and where their fathers are interred. He feels 
for them as his people, and, rather than inflict on them the misery 
of removal, he allows them to shift as they best may. 

But the selfishness both of tenants and proprietors does much 
more tq augment the evil under consideration than the cause now 
referred to. Thus a tenant takes a farm without sufficient capital 
to stock it, or to pay the rent.. He has, however, a remedy at hand 
in letting portions of the farm as crofts to some of the poor people 
in the vicinity, who are always eager to get any piece of ground. 
These, for a time, pay part of his rent, perform much of his agri- 
cultural work, and yield him considerable profit. But frequently 
in the course of no long period, they also get into difficulties, when 
they betake themselves to their master's expedient of subletting. 
The half of the croft is given to the oldest son, who immediately 
marries ; a farther portion is perhaps given to some other relative. 
The crofts, or lots as they are here called, dwindle down into the 
most insignificant patches, incapable of yielding food even for a 
quarter of a year to the many families which occupy them. The 
wages earned by labour must then go to purchase food. The cow 
is sold to pay the rent, and the unfortunate crofter sinks into a 
state of the most abject poverty. 

Again, when land is purchased with the sole view of pecuniary 
gain, it is undoubtedly the purchaser's interest to subdivide it as 
minutely as possible, for it is well-known that when there is a re- 
dundant population, the smaller that the lots of land are the greater 
will be the number of competitors for them, and of course the more 
will the rent exceed the actual value. Such proprietors take care 
to give no leases to their letters. They keep them as tenants at 
will, and thus it is easy to eject them if they become unable to pay 
the rent, and just as easy to get others to occupy their place, to 
subject themselves to the same fleecing process. Sometimes the 
reduced letter, though deprived of his cow, is not driven away from 
the estate, but is sent to the sea shore, where he may get fish for 
his own support, and for payment to the landlord for his hut, and 



344 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



the liberty of cultivating a small patch of waste land. If these 
unhappy individuals, as very frequently happens, under the dread 
of starvation, forget the laws of God and man, so as to "put forth 
their hand to steal," their master knows perfectly that, like the 
fox, they will not plunder near their own den, — that they will go 
to a distance to forage; and he needs not fear that his sheep will 
be touched by them, while there are some belonging to any other 
person within reach of a long night's journey. 

Thus an avaricious proprietor may at any time increase his rent- 
al in this country, by the subdivision of his farms, and for some 
years he will succeed in exacting every penny of his rack-rent. 
Again, if he wish to sell his property, the long rent-roll duly at- 
tested will enhance the value of it in the market. If he be de- 
sirous of borrowing money, through the same roll he may induce 
a money lender, ignorant of the actual state of matters, to advance 
on the security of the property a sum double its actual value. 

There are here strong temptations for hard-hearted avarice to 
deepen the evil under which the island already groans, to encou- 
rage the increase of the already teeming population, and there is 
an open door for cruelty on the one hand, and for fraud on the 
other; but we are glad to say that there are few who have yielded 
to the wicked solicitation, — that the more enlightened of the land- 
owners and of the tacksmen of this parish are sincerely anxious to 
promote the comfort of their people. 

It must be evident, at the same time, to every thinking man, 
that, while some of the land-owners and tacksmen may be to 
blame for the present state of things, yet that the main cause of 
the evil is to be found in the- ignorance of the people themselves. 
Were they enlightened, they would not submit to extortion or 
to want. They would seek in other quarters of the world the 
means of independent and comfortable subsistence. They might 
fare much better where they are. But generally they are unen- 
lightened — they are deplorably ignorant, and, being so, they are 
destitute of the true spirit of independence — of the proper ambi- 
tion to better their circumstances. They feel a blind, and, there- 
fore, a very powerful attachment to the rocks and glens amid which 
they were brought up — an almost invincible aversion to abandon 
them. They are improvident as to their marriages, and also as 
to the husbanding of the slender resources which are within their 
reach. Many of them are utterly careless regarding the future. 

The immediate and most obvious remedy for the evils arising 



ISLAND or SKYE— 'DUIRINISM. 345 

from the superabundant population of the parish is confessedly the 
removing of numbers of thfrpeople, by ennigration, to places where 
they may support themselves in comfort by the labour of their 
hands. 

This is a measure which is loudly called for by the circumstan- 
ces of the country, — demanded more loudly and imperiously each 
succeeding year, — and a measure which, if now neglected, will 
speedily force itself on the notice both of the land-owners, and the 
government of the kingdom, not only by the piteous wailing of 
want and of famine, — not only by the sad spectacle of a once mo- 
ral people becoming, through the hardening and animalizing in- 
fluence of grinding poverty, the reckless slaves of low passions, — 
but by the still more alarming, though not more woeful, spectacle 
of a loyal and peaceable people giving themselves up to robbery 
and rapine. The flocks of the large sheep-owners are annually 
thinned by those who feel the pinching of famine; and to such an 
extent is this system carried now, that it has led to the proposal of 
establishing a rural police throughout the island, which is ex- 
pected to come into immediate operation ; a measure completely 
unprecedented in the history of the Highlands. 

We do not expect, of course, that the evil is to be completely 
cured by emigration : but if the population were once thinned by 
that means, education would go far to do the rest. And besides 
the improving eff'ects of education on the character and habits of 
those who remain at home, it is well known to those who are 
acquainted with Skye, that the best educated among its common 
people generally, almost universally, have sought a foreign coun- 
try where to advance their fortunes ; that very few of those who 
receive even the rudiments of a good education remain at home ; 
and were knowledge generally given them, there would be no call 
either for the Government or for the land-owners to interfere 
with them. 

Habits of the People. — The habits of the people are farfrom being 
cleanly. Shaving is only a weekly work, sometimes not so frequent ; 
water is but sparingly employed for the ablution of the person, while 
clothes are very rarely changed. The houses are wretchedly filthy, 
so much so, that it is cause of wonder that their occupiers enjoy such 
a measure of health as they do. These houses have but one door, 
opening at the end. Next to the door is the byre, where the 
cattle stand every night during the year, — the cows sometimes fas- 
tened by a straw rope to one of the rafters in the roof, while the 

INVEUNESS. z 



34G 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



young animals go at large. The byre is cleaned only twice in the 
year, — at the beginning of winter, and at the end of spring, when 
the potatoes are planted ; and, previous to these respective periods, 
there are many feet of dung and straw in the dwelling. Over 
this height, however, it is necessary to climb in order to enter the 
litchen, which is at the opposite end of the house, and separated 
from the byre only by a very thin partition of boards or wattles, 
that does not reach above half-way to the roof. There is seldom 
any other apartment than this, except it be a small space railed off 
where the potatoes and fish are stowed. The furniture is very 
scanty and rude. A couple of bedsteads, filled with straw or hea- 
ther or ferns, a few chairs, and a table, generally complete the list. 
Such of the family as cannot find room in the beds sleep on the 
floor, and a stone is always deemed a good substitute for a chair. 
Indeed, there are some houses where no chair is used, — stones, 
pieces of dried turf, and one or two small stools or settles consti- 
tuting the only seats. The mode in which these comfortless dwel- 
lings are built, is worthy of notice, as being very peculiar. The 
walls are uncommonly broad, in some instances six or even seven 
feet. Properly speaking, there are two walls, built at the distance 
of eighteen inches or two feet from each other. This vacant space 
is filled up with earth, and the whole covered over at the top with 
green sod. The rafters are rested on the inner edge of the inner 
wall, instead of being placed on the outer edge, as in other places, 
consequently there is a considerable breadth of the wall left com- 
pletely exposed, and the rain of course enters here, and continually 
deluges the house. But the people, while they are anxious to ex- 
clude the wind, seem to have no dread of damp. I have seen two 
sheep grazing abreast on the top of one of these walls, and they 
might easily give room to a third. Two men might walk round 
on some of them, without any danger of falling off. 

The fire is always placed on the middle of the floor, and the 
only outlet provided for the smoke, is a small circular aperture in the 
roof. There is seldom more than one window in a house. This 
is placed at the inner edge of the wall, where it gives least light ; 
but very often, the hole where the window should be, is left open, 
except during a very strong wind, when it is stufl"ed up with some 
straw or rags of old clothes. Thus, owing to the exclusion of the 
light, and to the smoky atmosphere within the house, it is always 
enveloped in a twilight obscurity, which does not tend to the pro- 
motion of cleanHness or comfort.

The ordinary food of the peasantry is potatoes and fish, some- 
times potatoes and salt, and sometimes potatoes alone. Butcher- 
meat is almost unknown to them, and very little meal is used. 
Considering this wretchedly low diet on which they subsist, it is 
astonishing what work they perform, and what fatigue they un- 
dergo. 

Charade'. — The intellectual character of the people is good, — 
insomuch that, if a comparison were instituted between the advance- 
ment made by such Highland boys as attend school for a year 
or two, and that made by the boys of the peasantry in the Low- 
lands, in similar circumstances, it would be found very much in fa- 
vour of the former. 

If we compare the amount of crime committed in our parishes 
here with that committed even in rural parishes in the south, the 
balance will still be found in favour of the Highlands. But it is 
too apparent, at the same time, that crime in this part of the coun-' 
try has been much on the increase for several years back. This 
is partly owing to the poverty of the people : but in a great degree 
to the kind of intercourse which they carry on with the Lowlands. 
The great majority of the young women go thither annually dur- 
ing the harvest season, where they are not only withdrawn from 
the superintendence of their parents and friends, and destitute 
of the ordinances of religion, but are exposed to the contami- 
nation of the worst and most degraded society, and the effects are 
sadly visible in their loss of modesty and virtue. Many of them, 
after their return, give birth to children, who are unacknowledged 
by a father, and grow up without being received by the church, 
or much cared for by their mothers. There are several in the 
parish, of this unfortunate outcast class, unbaptized and unedu- 
cated. 

The young men generally go south in the latter end of spring, 
and continue at such work as they may find, until the begin- 
ning of winter, when they return home, and contribute of their 
earnings to the payment of their parents' crofts, but spend the 
remainder amid utter idleness, until the ensuing spring, when they 
resume their travels and their toil. Many of the aged men again, 
pass the months of June, July, and August, in fishing herring on 
the east coast of Scotland, and return to their homes only when 
their presence becomes necessary for the securing of their crops. 
Thus the population is quite a fluctuating one. The people, old 
and young, especially the latter, are for a considerable portion of 



348 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



the year removed from the salutary restraints of the presence of 
acquaintances and friends, and from the still more important re- 
straints of pastoral superintendence and gospel ministrations. The 
service of the sanctuary conducted in English is to them in an un- 
known tongue, from which they derive no benefit, and on which 
consequently they do not wait. They are, while in the south, 
strangers, in whose moral or religious circumstances no one feels 
an interest; and thus abandoned to their own "wills, and exposed 
to the contact of society worse than themselves, they become each 
year more and more callous, and lawless, more and more confirm- 
ed in vice. A provision for the religious instruction of these poor 
wanderers who annually migrate from their own homes in quest of 
subsistence would certainly be a desirable boon. 

The people universally have a sense of religion, — of the religion 
of nature. Indeed, I have never met with a common Highlander 
who did not shudder at the mere mention of Atheism. At the 
same time, however, they are very ignorant of the religion taught 
in the Bible, — of the way of salvation through Christ Jesus. A 
strict profession of holiness is, it may be remarked, more honour- 
ed here than in many other parts of Scotland, the neighbouring 
county of Ross alone excepted, and there are some who act up to 
their profession. Yet the people generally are unacquainted both 
with the letter and the spirit of true religion, and there is much 
superstition, the sure concomitant of ignorance, still lingering 
among them. Our limits forbid us to enter at any length on this 
subject, but we may remark, that while it is now rare, though not 
unknown, to use charms or incantations for curing the diseases of 
the human frame, these means are daily resorted to for curing the 
diseases of cattle. " Silver water," as it is called, " fairy arrows," 
and ' charmed stones," are still held to be possessed of much ef- 
ficacy, and they who have power to call forth their virtues are held 
in high estimation. 

There is at least one man in the parish who professes to be pos- 
sessed of the mysterious power known as the " second-sight." He 
affirms that he frequently foresees coming events ; but he wishes 
not to be spoken to on the subject, and seems to consider his gift 
a misfortune more than a benefit. 

Smuggling may be said to be unknown now throughout the isl- 
and. A cask of foreign brandy or Hollands, and a roll of smug- 
gled tobacco are occasionally, but very rarely, received from some 



ISLAND OF SKYE 



DUIRINISII. 



349 



of the Baltic traders; and there is no illicit distillation carried on. 
Poaching is also nearly unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Almost the whole population is engaged more or 
less in agriculture. There are five proprietors of land residing in 
the parish, all of whom farm to some extent, except one. There 
are seven tacksmen, or occupiers of large farms. There are 40 
individuals who support themselves mainly by handicraft, or re- 
tailing merchandise : but all these have patches of land. There 
are two ministers, one surgeon, and ten schoolmasters in the pa- 
rish. There are at least 1200 grown up males employed in agri- 
culture during a considerable portion of the year, either as croft- 
ers, or as farm-servants. There are no retired capitalists among us. 

There are 1900 acres now in cultivation, and upwards of 3000 
which were once cultivated, but are now in pasture. Thus there 
are about 40,000 acres which have always remained waste. There 
are 12,000 acres of these that might be brought into tillage, 4000 
of which would probably yield a good return for the expense. 
The remainder, however, would require a greater outlay of capital 
than it would be prudent to expend upon them. 100 acres under 
wood; no undivided common. 

The rate of grazing varies both according to the quality of the 
pasture, and the will of him who lets it. That of a cow ranges 
from L.l to L.3, 10s. ; of a sheep from Is. to 4s. per annum. 

Wages. — The common wages of labourers are, in summer Is., 
in winter 9d. ; of artisans, 2s. 6d. without victuals ; of female ser- 
vants, from L.3 to L.4, 10s. in the year ; of men, from L.6 to 
L.l 8, according tothe charge entrusted to them. 

Live-Stock. — There are still some of the caoirich bheaga, or 
little sheep, — that is, the breed of sheep indigenous to the High- 
lands, — kept by the poor people ; but they are very worthless com- 
pared with the larger kinds introduced from the south. They are 
very diminutive in size, seldom weighing more than 30 jjounds, 
and are to be found of a great variety of colours, white, black, 
grey, brown, and sometimes with a mixture of all these. They 
are, however, useful to the common people, as they require very 
little food to support them, and are so tame as to allow themselves 
to be milked daily. Their wool is of a fine quality ; and their 
mutton possesses a delicacy of flavour which far surpasses that be- 
longing to the best fed of the larger kinds. 

These sheep constituted at one time all the flocks of the coun-

try; and it is not above forty years since the cauirich mhora, 
or black-faced breed of the south, were introduced here. The 
gentleman who did introduce them is still living, though of an ad- 
vanced age. The black-faced sheep were found to answer very 
well ; but they are now rapidly giving place to the Cheviots, which 
are found to answer still better. Every extensive farmer in the 
parish has adopted them as the most profitable stock ; and great 
attention has been paid to their improvement, so much so, that it 
is generally admitted that there are not better sheep in the whole 
county, than are reared in this parish. 

The black-cattle may be said to have given place almost en- 
tirely to the sheep. The crofters still keep them ; but those that 
they have, are of a very inferior description. There are only two 
of the gentlemen who retain what is called a. fold of cows. These, 
however, are of very fine quality ; and it is evident that the .soil is 
well adapted for the rearing both of sheep and black-cattle. 

Husbandry/. — The most improved methods of husbandry were 
adopted several years ago by the land proprietors and the 
wealthy tacksmen ; but their example seems to have produced no 
effect on the common people, who still pursue a very antiquated, 
laborious, and unprofitable mode of tilling their land. It is rarely 
that they use a plough ; and though they are sufficiently well ac- 
quainted with the use of the spade, they never apply it to this 
purpose. The instrument in use among them is called cas-chrom, 
literally the crooked leg, a kind of clumsy spade, or rather a very 
rude and primitive plough ; probably the primitive one which 
was subsequently so much improved on in various parts of the 
world. The cas-chrom is pointed with a piece of iron nearly half an 
inch in thickness, about ten inches in length, and four in breadth, 
which may be called its sock. Into this is fixed the sole, a strong 
piece of wood from two to three feet in length ; and to the sole is 
fastened, by means of nails, the handle or stilt, which is about five 
feet in length, considerably thicker than a man's wrist, and forms 
a very obtuse angle with the sole or lower part. At the junction 
of the sole and handle, there is a wooden pin, caWed sffonnan, fixed 
in at right angles to the sole, for the foot to rest upon when the 
implement is used in digging. 

With this implement, rude and unwieldy as it is, accomplishing 
the work very superficially, do thousands of the inhabitants of this 
island, and of a few other portions both of Inverness and Ross- 



ISLAND OF SKYE 



DUIUINISH.

shires, cultivate their lands ; not only plant, but hoe and dig their 
potatoes ; and it is difficult or apparently impossible to convince 
them, that there is any other which is better suited for these pur- 
poses. When oats or barley are pUt into the ground ploughed by 
the cas-chrom, it is harrowed, sometimes by means of a large rake 
made for the purpose, sometimes by a light harrow made of the or- 
dinary shape, but having wooden teeth, and drawn either by men 
or by women. I have seen this kind of harrow drawn by a horse ; 
but it was fastened in a very primitive, and, to me, a v"fery new 
mode. The whole harness consisted of two straw ropes, the one 
of which was attached to the head, and the other to the tail of 
the animaU The one supplied the place of reins, the other of 
traces, collar, and hems. The harrow was tied to the tail by this 
straw rope, and the horse pulled away, apparently not much in- 
commoded by the weight fastened to it. 

In shearing their corn, the people use the common scythe hook ; 
but in tedding their hay, they use no rakes for gathering it. This 
is done either by means of straight poles, or by the hands, and of 
course some of the hay is left on the ground, while much time is 
very needlessly lost. 

The crofters have no notion of the advantage of following the 
rotation system in cropping. The only change is from oats to po- 
tatoes, and from potatoes to oats. But they do not always give 
such an advantage to the soil as is implied, even in this limited 
range. It is by no means uncommon to sow oats for three or four 
years running in the same spot, and that without giving it any ma- 
nure. When it is getting out of heart, as it almost always does on 
the second year, the only mode of enriching it that is resort- 
ed to, is the heaping it up into narrower compass, — gathering in the 
edges of the broad ridges. This will ensure a tolerable crop from the 
centre of the ridge for another year, but meantime the sides be- 
come utterly unproductive. In the course of another year or two, 
the centre becomes equally so, and when the soil is thus complete- 
ly scourged and exhausted, it is left uncultivated for some four or 
five years, until it regains strength. But during this process of 
renovation it may be said to be totally useless, yielding nothing 
but weeds ; and even these in very small quantities. 

The oats sown are generally known as black oats, which are very 
small in the grain, and consequently yield little meal when ground. 
The potatoes also are of a soft and watery description. There is 
no attempt at draining or irrigation made. So little do the peo- 



352 



INVEIINKSS-SIIIHI':. 



pie know of the unfavourable eflects of water on their crops, thab 
many of them when cultivating slopes, or declivities, draw the fur- 
vows right apross the face of the slopes, instead of drawing them 
up and down, so as to carry off the water. The raising of clover, 
I'ye-grass, or turnip, is utterly unknown among them. 

It may be noticed, that the grain which is sent to the mill is ge- 
nerally dried in an iron pot over a common fire. The meal thus 
made" is called min urdraidh, and is preferred both by the com- 
mon people and gentry to the meal dried on the ordinary kilns. 
It is also worthy of remark, that the grain is carried to the mill, 
not in sacks of the common description, but in sacks made of bent 
or rushes, or some other kind of grass. These are used as keep- 
ing places for grain and for meal. Indeed, they are the only sacks 
in use among the people, and are universally known by the name 
of pMtachan. It was customary, not very many years ago, to per- 
form the processes of thrashing and of kiln-drying the grain simul- 
taneously, by passing the sheaf of corn through a fire made of 
straw. The filaments that attach the grain to the stalk were rea- 
dily consumed, the grain fell down into the fire, which was so re- 
gulated as to scorch but not to consume it, and the remainder of 
the straw was thrown aside as useless litter. When the burning 
process was over, the grain was separated from the ashes and dust 
in which it had been buried, and ground by the quern or hand- 
mill. The meal thus made was called min ffhrddaui, and was 
very highly prized by all classes. It is not more than thirty years 
since this expensive and tedious mode of making meal was in al- 
most any instance departed from. So necessary to be followed 
was this method thought, that many intelligent farmers allowed 
their cattle to starve for want of provender during spring, while 
in order to have min ghradain, they daily burnt more straw than 
would keep the cattle alive. I have it on undoubted authority, 
that a tacksman who died only a few years ago, a man of wealth 
and information, who used to quote the Georgics, and passages of 
Horace, over his bottle of wine, allowed, just thirty years ago, ten 
milch cows to die of starvation, while he had six stacks of corn in 
the barn-yard, all reserved for viin ghrddain. Such are the effects 
of old habits. 

The general duration of leases is fifteen years. The farm- 
buildings are generally good, and the fences quite sufficient. There 
has been great advancement made within the last forty years in 
regard to draining, rotation of crops, introducing good seed, new 



ISLAND OF SKYE DUIRINISH. 



333 



alid effectual farming implements, and in general all the improve- 
ments in agriculture known in the south by the upper classes. 

The chief obstacles to farther improvement by the gentlemen and 
tacksmen are the raininess of the climate, which renders it diffi- 
cult to secure a crop, though it should be reared ; in some instan- 
ces, want of capital, and in others, indifference to the subject. 
Among the cottars, again, one obstacle is want of leases ; it should 
be remembered that they are only the occupiers of extensive farms 
who generally have leases, — that the cottars are almost universally 
tenants at will ; want of capital, ignorance, and the rooted at- 
tachment that they feel to the habits in which they have been 
brought up. They know that the system which they follow is an 
unproductive one. They see a proper system pursued by the gen- 
tlemen around them : but some will say that they will not bestow 
their labour on improving land which may become another's be- 
fore the end of a year. Others again, that they cannot afford to 
purchase good farming implements, to drain or to enclose ; and 
many, that they will live as their forefathers did. 

Fisheries. — There are no fisheries for which rent is exacted ; 
but there is a considerable quantity of fish caught in the creeks and 
lochs on the coast. The average annual value may be stated at 
L. 900. The fish is chiefly cod and ling, which are split up, salt- 
ed, dried, and in this state sent to the market. 

Raw Produce. — The total value of raw produce raised in the 
parish I am unable to state. The rental is L.4200, and the crop 
is not sufficient for food to the inhabitants, during more than eight 
or nine months of the year. 

Kelp, — There are about eighty tons of kelp manufactured an- 
nually in the parish. It does little more than repay the bare 
expense of making ; but it is taken as payment of rent by one of 
the landed proprietors ; and thus he turns the labour of the people 
to some account. 

Navigation, — There are three wherries, each about ten tons 
burden, belonging to the parish. No foreign vessels visit it for 
the purpose of trading. 

V. — Parochial EcoNOMy. 
Market-Town, c, — There is no market-town in the parish. 
The nearest is that of Portree, which is twenty-four miles distant 
from the central part of the parish. There is a village called 
Stein, in the district of Waternish, built several years ago by the 
North British Fishery Society, which, however, has not in any 



354 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



degree answered the benevolent purposes contemplated by its 
builders. 

Means of Commjcnication.— There is one post-office, where there 
are arrival, and from which there are despatches of letters three 
times a-week. The length of turnpike road is about thirty-five 
miles. There are no canals or railroads. The harbours have 
been noticed in an early part of the account. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the centre 
of the parish, and is accessible to as many of the parishioners as 
will fill it; but it is very remote from nearly two-thirds of the po- 
pulation, many of them being eleven miles distant from it. It was 
built nine years ago, and is both substantially and tastefully finish- 
ed. It is seated for nearly 600. All the seats are rent free. 

There is no manse in the parish, the heritors allowing L.57 an- 
nually in lieu of it. The extent of the glebe is very great, being a 
mile and a quarter long by a mile broad ; but, owing to the poverty of 
the soil, the annual value of it is not more than L.30. The stipend 
paid by the heritors is L.96. The deficiency is made up by the 
Exchequer. There is a church, built by the Church Extension 
Committee, situated in the district of Flasheddar or Arnizort, 
about twelve miles from the parish church. It contains 330 sitters, 
and is a very great convenience to the district ; but no minister has 
been appointed to it. There is a Government church, as already 
mentioned, in the district of Waternish, which forms a parish quoad 
sacra, having a population of 1700. There are neither mission- 
aries nor catechists in the parish, though both are very much 
needed. There is no Dissenting chapel of any description. All 
the parishioners profess to belong to the Established Church, ex- 
cept four families, who attend an Episcopalian chapel, which is 
situated in the neighbouring parish of Bracadale. 

The sacrament of the Lord's Supper has not been dispensed 
at the parish church for the last eleven years until 1840, 
when only 35 communicants partook of the ordinance. In 
the Government church of Waternish, there was about the same 
number. It may be noticed here, that there is in this parish, as 
in almost every other parish in Skye, a set of men who regard 
" sealing ordinances" as of very little importance, — who seem to 
think that their efficacy depends to a great extent on him who ad- 
ministers them, and thus will receive them from the hands of a 
minister whom they approve of in every respect, but will, on no 
account, receive them from a person to whom they have an objec- 



ISLAND OF SKYE 



DUIRINISH. 



355 



tion, however trivial ; who, again, thinlc that the efficacy will be 
completely taken away by the presence, at the same table with 
them, even of one unconverted person, — and being very uncharita- 
ble in forming an estimate of the character of those whose opinions 
differ in any respect from their own, they are remarkably scru- 
pulous as to those with whom they will partake. Through the in- 
fluence of these men among whom there are some lay-preachers, 
aided by others who ought to have known better, the majority of 
the people have been brought to regard the sacraments, especially 
that of the Lord's Supper, with a degree of horror which causes 
almost all of them to avoid partaking of it. Thus there are nearly 
200 children in the parish un baptized, and the table of the Lord 
is unfrequented. It has, to a certain extent, become a proof of 
piety to avoid partaking of the sacraments ; and it is much to be 
feared that, when Christ's commands in regard to one subject have 
come to be set aside for the opinions of men, His commands in re- 
gard to others will, in process of time, be treated with equal dis- 
regard. Yet the unscriptural notions under consideration are daily 
gaining ground in the place. 

There have been L.64 contributed in the parish this year for 
religious and educational purposes. 

Education. — There are ten schools in the parish, — one paro- 
chial ; five supported by the Assembly's Education Committee ; 
three by the Gaelic School Society ; one by an Episcopalian So- 
ciety ; and one unendowed. Gaehc alone is taught in the three 
schools supported by the Gaelic School Society. In all the others 
English and arithmetic are taught. The salaries of the school- 
masters do not average more than L.23 per annum. The school 
fees everywhere, except in the parochial school, where they amount 
to about L.8 a-year, are merely nominal, or very nearly so, not 
averaging L.l in each school. The fees charged in the parish 
school range from 8s. to 12s. in the year, according to the branches 
taught. One-third of the children between six and fifteen years 
are unable to read, and of the grown-up population there are two- 
thirds in the same condition. 

The people, in general, are very indifferent regarding education, 
and keep their children from school for very trifling reasons. They 
are so very apathetic on this subject, that it would be highly de- 
sirable to introduce the compulsory regulations of Prussia among 
them. There is a portion of the parish where there are 150 chil- 
dren capable of attending school, who are so distant from a school- 



INVEllNESS-SHIRE. 



house as to render attendance impossible ; but we liave a promise 
of a school in this locality from the Assembly's Education Com- 
niittee. Still, there are three additional schools required, in order 
to render it easy for all the children to attend. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.—There are 100 persons who rank 
as ordinary paupers, besides from 40 to 50 who receive occasional 
relief. The sum annually contributed for their support is a mere 
trifle. During the last year they got L. 10 as a legacy ; L.14 as 
donations from two individuals connected with the parish ; L.IO from 
two of the heritors; and L.7 from church door collections; mak- 
ing a total of L.41. Those who received the highest allowance 
did not get more than lOs. The sum annually collected at the 
church door, does not amount to more than L.IO, and there is no 
regular provision whatever made for the poor. They beg from 
place to place, and are always liberally assisted both by the tacks- 
men and by the crofters, who have anything at all to spare. But, 
at the same time, the condition of those who are bed-rid is a very 
wretched one ; while some of those who go about, though they re- 
ceive food, are miserably ill off in regard to clothing. Some time 
ago, it was thought degrading to apply for aid from the poor's 
funds ; but this is not so by any means now, and there are many 
applying for relief who have no title to it. 

Fairs. — There is one fair annually held at a place called Fairy 
Bridge, which is three miles from Dunvegan. It is held for the 
purpose of disposing of black-cattle, but very few are sold there. 

Inns. — There are two inns and three dram-houses or ale-houses, 
as they are sometimes called, in the parish. The principal inn, 
•which is at Dunvegan, is remarkably well kept ; and it is always 
found, that where the inn-keeper is a man of right principle, there 
are few excesses committed in his house. Two of the other houses 
are entirely supernumerary, yet, much to the credit of the people, 
there is no great quantity drunk in them. The people generally 
are remarkably sober. 

Fuel. — The only fuel used by the common people is peats. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Very great changes have taken place in the parish, both in re- 
gard to the aspect of the country, and to the habits of the people, 
since the last Statistical Account was published. 

The formation of roads and bridges may be first adverted to. 
Twenty-five years ago, there was only one bridge in the parish, 
and not a mile of carriage road. Now, there are lines of excellent 



ISLAliJD OF SKYE DUIUINISH. 



357 



road traversing it in various directions, and every stream that crosses 
these Hnes is spanned by a bridge. The district of Glendale is 
the only part that is yet left in its original inaccessible state. It 
may not be undeserving of notice, as illustrative of the effects of 
long-formed habits, and of that prejudice against innovation which 
is natural to a primitive race, that, for some years after the con- 
struction of roads, the common people would not on any account 
travel on them. They said that the stones and gravel both bruis- 

 ed the feet, and wore the shoes, and they preferred to follow the 
old paths, uneven and boggy as they were. Now, however, they 
have become reconciled to level, dry, and hard roads, and the old 
paths are almost undistinguishable, being covered with heather 
and moss. 

The mode of agriculture pursued on the larger farms has like- 
wise undergone a total change. Now, fields of clover and turnip 
are to be seen, where at one time there was nothing but use- 
less bog-grass growing; and a system of five years' rotation is 
adopted instead of the old one of two. New agricultural imple- 
ments have likewise been introduced. No longer than twenty 
years ago, ploughs made entirely of wood, with the exception of 
the sock and coulter, were to be seen dragged by four horses, which 
required two men to drive them, and whose work was so imper- 
fectly done, that . three men were employed in beating down the 
only half-turned furrows, and levelling the very uneven surface left 
behind. Wooden harrows, and carts of very clumsy workman- 
ship, in the few places where carts were available, were the only 
ones used; while generally, the articles to be transported from one 
place to another were carried on horses' backs. Now, one man 

• drives a pair of horses with an iron plough, and does more than 
the work of six men with four horses. Iron harrows, carts of the 
best description, and indeed every farming implement used in the 
south of Scotland, are to be seen every day. 

Both dwelling-houses and farm-offices have undergone an equal- 
ly great improvement ; and the stock has been completely changed. 

About thirty-five years ago, black-cattle and horses constituted 
the wealth of the tenantry, and were found grazing on the tops of 
the highest hills. The few sheep kept were almost exclusively 
used for the table. The gentleman who broke in upon this sys- 
tem, is still living in a neighbouring parish, and has seen black- 
faced sheep universally introduced, and again give place to Cher- 
viots, which now graze from the summits of the hills to the 



358 



INVERNESS-SHIUE. 



lowest meadows, constituting almost the sole stock of the tacks- 
men. 

The habits of the upper classes have likewise altered to some 
extent. They pay much more attention to literature than it was 
formerly customary to do; and the boisterous conviviality which, 
thirty years ago, was in very high estimation among them, is now 
almost universally abandoned and discountenanced. Their hospi- 
tality continues as unbounded as ever, but in the exercise of it the 
rules of temperance or decorum are very rarely violated, and ' 
every excess is condemned and discouraged. 

The immensely increased facilities of attaining education make 
a great and most beneficial change in the situation of the common 
people. Now, there are not more than 200 or 300 children in the 
parish who may not, without any very long journeys, attend school 
daily. Twenty years ago, there was not that number who could 
attend school. Schools have not yet produced the efifects which 
they are fitted to do. But their influence is felt more and more 
each succeeding year ; and could the parents be prevailed upon to 
keep their children regularly in them for the apace of a few years, 
they would soon work a total and most beneficial change in the 
condition of the community. 

The people have become less social, but much more peaceable 
in their conduct towards one another, and more temperate than 
they formerly were. It was, as is well known, customary for 
neighbours to visit each other's houses nightly, and to while away 
part of the long winter evenings, in reciting tales and traditions, 
singing songs, or playing some musical instrument. Now, all this 
is completely given up. It is with difficulty that a tradition re- 
garding the once most popular characters or events can be picked • 
up. " The Tales," or " Sffeulachdan," seem to be totally forgot- 
ten. It is rare to hear a song sung, and still rarer to hear the 
sound of pipe or violin. Each family confines itself to its own 
dwelling, or, if a visit is paid, the time is spent in retailing the silly 
gossip of the day. People certainly may be far more beneficially 
employed than the old Highlanders used to be ; yet we conceive 
the change in their habits to be a subject of regret on various 
grounds. The traditions of a country — the only source of infor- 
mation concerning bygone days in the absence of written records 

are always interesting and instructive ; and it is to be lamented 

that the traditions of the Highlands have been to a great degree 
irrecoverably lost. Still more is it to be deplored that the 



ISLAND OF SKYE DUIRINISH. 



359 



" Sgeulaclidan" or tales, which were at one period so universally 
prized, are now so completely forgotten ; for they were not only 
couched in apt and heautiful language, showing that the Gaelic, 
now become so harsh, and rusty, and unmanageable, was at one 
time smooth, euphonous, and pliable; but the imagery employed 
in them displayed often a rich and highly cultivated fancy ; while 
they almost universally contained a moral, highly important and 
well-pointed. In these and in the proverbs of the country, were 
the collective wisdom and intelligence of the Highlands to be seen. 
But both tales and proverbs are now nearly lost ; and while most 
interesting fragments might yet be recovered and preserved, the 
time for making a complete collection is for ever past. 

It is at the same time sincere cause of joy to every one truly 
interested in their welfare, that the people have abandoned their 
old customs in solemnizing funerals and marriages. Not many 
years ago, the memory of a person even in the humblest ranks 
would be thought dishonoured, unless from fifty to sixty individuals 
accompanied his remains to the grave. During the fdrair" or 
wake, and especially on the day of the interment, such a quantity 
of meat and drink was distributed as kept the nearest surviving 
relatives for several years in the greatest poverty, in order to pay 
them, and what was far more to be lamented, so much whisky was 
drunk in the church, or in the churchyard after the interment, 
that people often forgot the sacredness of the place, and the so- 
lemnity of the occasion, renewed old feuds and dissensions, and 
fought fiercely amid the graves of their ancestors. The sod which, 
but a short time previous, was bedewed with the tears, and wit- 
nessed the lamentations of relatives mourning for him who was 
laid underneath, was stained with the blood, and became witness 
to the oaths and imprecations of other relatives, perhaps equally 
sincere in their attachment to the deceased, but for a time under 
the ungovernable influence of intoxication. Happily, however, 
these savage scenes are known now, only as the things of bygone 
days. Indeed, what may be termed a violent reaction has taken 
place in the feelings and customs of the people in regard to the 
funeral obsequies of their friends, which are at the present day 
conducted more quietly and privately than perhaps in anv other 
poruon of Scotland. Only a very few friends, generally from ten 
to fifteen, assemble to the interment of a common man, and the 
expense incurred does not amount to more than a very trifling 
sum, from L.l to L.l, lOs.

INVERNKSS-SHIRE. 



The change in regard to marriages is equally great. Formerly, 
from 80 to 100 persons used to assemble, and to pass at least two 
days in feasting and dancing. Now the average number does not 
exceed five or six; the bridal feast is often nothing more than the 
usual poor fare of potatoes and herrings, with the addition of a 
glass of whisky to each individual present, and music and dancing 
are generally discontinued. Balls and dancing parties have also 
been given up throughout the parish. Indeed, all public gather- 
ings, whether for shinty playing, or throwing the putting-stone, 
for drinking and dancing, for marriages or funerals, have been 
discontinued, and people live very much apart. There is not a 
tenth part of the whisky consumed that was consumed in the olden 
time ; nor is there one fight for ten that were then fought. Disputes 
are now referred to the arbitration of the Sheriff, instead of being 
settled by club-law. 

In regard to the general morals of the parish, — a change which, 
upon the whole, may be pronounced decidedly favourable, has 
taken place. An open and unshrinking profession of religion, of 
the faith of Christ, is more frequent and more honoured than it 
was not many years ago ; and while there are some guilty of more 
glaring immorality than was then known, yet there are others 
leading lives of stricter purity and godliness. Thus the two ex- 
tremes are separating more widely, and it is cause of rejoicing to 
think, that, though the wicked are becoming more bold in their 
wickedness, believers are at the same time becoming more cou- 
rageous in the cause of the Lord, and that, being engaged in his 
cause, they will assuredly prevail.

PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. SIMON ERASER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Situation, and Extent. — The parisji of Kilmorack, like 
many other parishes in the Highlands of Scotland, derives its 
name from its having afforded burial ground to some reputed 
saint or person of distinction — Kill Mhorac, signifying the bury- 
ing-ground of young Marion. From what family the lady sprung, 
cannot with certainty be determined ; though it seems most like- 
ly she was a descendant of one of the lairds of Chisholm, who, long 
before the Reformation, was the principal resident heritor in the 
parish, and to whose family a large proportion of it still belongs. 

The parish is bounded on the south, by the River Beauly, the 
parishes of Kirkhill and Kiltarlity ; on the north and east, by the 
parishes of Urray and Killearnan ; and on the west, by the pa- 
rish of Kintail. 

Topographical Appearances. — To a spectator placed on an emi- 
nence where an extensive view of this parish could be obtained, it 
would present a scene of sublimity and grandeur, united with rich- 
ness and beauty, almost unrivalled. Its eastern extremity consists 
of a large open plain, about three miles in diameter. Along 
its southern boundary, the river Beauly gently glides. About 
two miles west from the village of Beauly are situated the 
celebrated Falls of Kilmorack, which are annually visited by 
hundreds from all parts of the empire. They are less remark- 
able for their height than for their breadth, and the great volume 
of water poured over the precipice. The beautiful accompani- 
ments of lofty rocks, green banks, and hanging woods, which encir- 
cle them, greatly add to the charms of the scene. As the water ap- 
proaches the precipice, 20 feet in height, it « hovers doubtful, as 
It wore, for a moment over the gulf, and as if forced reluctantly by 
the unconscious river behind, it is poured down without resistance, 
in one unbroken ponderous mass," into a deep cavern, which cannot

be viewed without feelings of apprehension. It then, for a short 
distance, gently pnrsues its course, and slowly forces its passage 
through a narrow opening between two lofty precipices, when it 
suddenly expands into an open semicircular basin, through which it 
glides with a sluggish motion, and is then precipitated over the low- 
er falls in a variety of cataracts. On the northern brow of the cliff, 
stands a little handsome summer-house, from which an advanta- 
geous view of this romantic scene can be obtained. The falls not be- 
mg sufficiently high or powerful, when the river is in any measure 
flooded, the salmon attempt to leap over the cascades ; often, how- 
ever, in the act of springing, they fall a prey to those who stand watch- 
ing them on the bank with hooks, or spears fixed to long rods; or 
from the constant agitation of the water where they swim, on ac- 
count of the height from which it falls, they mistake their direc- 
tion and land on the dry rock. Branches of trees have been arrang- 
ed along the edges of these shelves, to prevent them from regain- 
ing the river, and by this means from eight to twelve of them have 
been caught in one night. It is reported of one of the Lords of 
Lovat, that, having met, on a certain occasion, an English gentle- 
man, and the conversation turning on the objectsof curiosity on their 
properties, he  Lovatboasted that there was a kettle of boiling water 
on the south side of the river which flowed through his estate, in- 
to which the salmon from the river frequently leaped. The true ac- 
count of this apparently wonderful fact is, that, at the bottom of the 
southern precipice, there is a circularpit, kept constantly in a state of 
agitation by the descending volume of water, into which the salmon 
are driven back, when attempting to ascend the stream. 

For the space of two or three miles west of the parish church, the 
course of the Beauly is most romantic. This spot is called the 
Dhruim, the back. On either side the mountain acclivities are co- 
vered with birch and fir, and the edges of the river are beautifully 
lined all along with rows of oak, weeping-birches, and alders. 
The river, during this part of its course, consists of a series 
of cascades, precipitated over shelving masses of red sandstone, 
while in the middle of the strath, close by the farm-house of 
Teanassie, the waters plunge through a rocky passage, encircling 
high pyramids of stone, standing in the midst of the stream. At 
the farther end of the Dhruim, stands the Island of Aigrsh, on 
which the present proprietor has built a beautiful dwelling-house. 

The western division of the parish assumes a wilder and rough- 
er aspect : it is of decidedly Alpine character. It consists of the 



KILMORACK.

three great glens of Stratliglass, Glenstrafarrar, and Gleiieannich, 
so called from the different streams which run through each. 

Meteorology. — The climate may be said to be generally humid 
and mild. The thermometer in the hot season ranges between 
70° and 80°, while in the depth of winter it has not for some 
years past been observed below 24° of Fahrenheit. The average 
temperature may be stated about 48°. The changes in the baro- 
meter are frequent and rapid, often rising and falling half an inch 
in the course of an hour. 

Hydroyraphy. — The principal river is the Beauly, compos- 
ed of the three lesser streams Farrar, Cannich, and Glass, in- 
cluding Dheaick. Lakes are found almost in every district of 
the parish. The principal of these, are Loch Monar, Loch 
Beineveau, and Loch Affric, which are surrounded by the re- 
mains of an extensive pine forest. The scenery of these lakes 
is of singular grandeur : and perhaps, in that respect they are un- 
equalled by any in Scotland. On the mountain of Maum Soule, 
on the north side of Loch Beinevean, is the largest known body of 
perennial snow in Britain. In the middle of June, when the sun 
is vertical, a very little part of it only is dissolved. At the re- 
mote end of Glen-Strathfarrar lies Loch Muilie. In the centre of 
this loch, there is a small island, to which it is reported the late 
Lord Lovat retired, after the total defeat of his party at Cul- 
loden. Here, there is now a very neat shooting-box, which 
the present proprietor erected. Four or five miles further to 
the west. Loch Monar occupies a wild hollow a little to the north 
of the mountain Scour- na-lapich, which in height almost equals 
Bennevis. Here there is an excellent fishing station, which is 
frequently resorted to by those who are fond of this sport. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The prevailing rocks in the parish 
are gneiss, the old red sandstone, and the conglomerate rock, near 
Little Struy. A black lead mine, situated in a thick vein of heavy 
spar, traversing gneiss, was opened some years ago by Lovat, 
but it did not turn out profitable, the rock being exceedingly 
tough and hard, and the quality of the plumbago rather inferior. 
The soils in this parish are various — rich loamy, clayey, sandy, 
and gravelly. 

Zoology. — Most of the animals found in this parish are such as 
are common to the Highlands in general. In the western glens 
the red-deer are found in abundance ; — polecats, weasels, and 
Jiares are numerous. In many parts, the rabbits are a nui-

INVERNESS-SHIUE. 



sance. They excavate their burrows in the lower slopes of 
sandy hillocks, whence they issue in scores, greatly damaging the. 
corn in the neighbourhood. Two or three hundred of them have 
been often killed on some farms, in the short space of ten days. 
The fox is still an inhabitant of our glens. In the precipices 
among the higher mountains, the eagle builds its nest ; hawks of 
different species abound, as do also the owl, rook, hooded-crow, 
jackdaws, and raven. Magpies are not unfrequent. Blackcock 
and grouse of different varieties are numerous ; the ptarmigan is 
frequently met with ; and partridges are abundant. The rock and 
wood-pigeon often occur. 

Fishes. — The Beauly abounds in salmon, grilse, and trout. 
The fishing season of the salmon commences on the 1st of Fe- 
bruary ; of the grilse, on the 1st of June ; and of the trout, on the 
1st of July. A stray pike is found now and then. Yellow trout 
are also sometimes met with. The lakes in the different districts 
abound in pike and trout. 

Botany. — There is nothing very peculiar in the Flora of this 
parish. The Vaccinium oxycoccos, called the badge of the clan 
Grant, is found in the hills of Strathglass. The edges of many 
small pools are encircled with broad and beautiful belts of the 
Nymphea alba, or white water-lily. The trees indigenous to the 
soil are, oak, birch, fir, and alder. Larch, hazel, and spruce 
were some time ago introduced, and seem to be quite congenial. 
In the upper districts of the country, there were formerly extensive 
pine forests ; the only relics of which are a few solitary trees, that 
still cling to the precipices, or trunks dug up from the mosses. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Persons. — The first individual worthy of notice, is the 
Rev. John Farquharson, well known as the first collector of Gaelic 
poetry. He resided, for upwards of thirty years, in the Strath- 
glass district of the parish, in the capacity of Jesuit missionary. 
Some time after the Rebellion of 1745, Mr Farquharson was ap- 
pointed Prefect of Studies in the Scots College of Douay, where he 
remained till the year 1773. Having returned to Scotland at this 
period, he left his MSS. behind him ; but these papers having fallen 
into the hands of persons unacquainted vy ith the language, were to- 
tally mutilated and destroyed. Information, however, was after- 
wards obtained from those who were students at Douay during Mr 
Farquharson's residence there, that after Macpherson's translation 
of Ossian's Poems appeared, they had a distinct recollection of Far- 



KILMOIIACK.

quharsoii comparing them with some of those in his collection ; 
and remarking, that in many places, the translation fell far short 
of the original. The poems of Fingal and Temora were parti- 
cularly mentioned as having been thus compared. 

The late Chisholm of Chisholm, chief of the clan of that name, 
cannot pass unnoticed in any account of this parish. His eminent 
classical and scientific attainments, graced and sanctified by his 
unostentatious and unfeigned piety, rendered him peculiarly fitted 
for the honourable situation of representing his native county in 
Parliament. To that situation he was called at an early period of 
his life ; but death cut short his career almost in its commence- 
ment. The schemes of usefulness which he projected and carried 
on in the midst of his poor tenantry, remain, however, to testify 
his unbounded generosity and philanthropy. 

Antiquities. — In different parts of the parish, are to be seen 
the remains of many Druidical temples; and there is a chain of 
walled structures within sight of one another, proceeding up the 
river Beauly, and along the course of its parent streams, the Farrar 
and the Glass, and from the latter to Glen AfFric. But what most 
attracts the attention of the traveller is the ruins of the Priory of 
Beauly, which rears its venerable walls above the aged trees which 
surround it. It belonged to the order of Valliscaulium, — a reformed 
portion of the Cistercians, following the rule of St Bennet, who were 
brought into Scotland in the beginning of the thirteenth century, 
by Malvoison, Bishop of St Andrews. This priory was founded 
by James Bisset of Lovat in the year 1230. The conditions in 
behalf of its founder were, " ut pro ipso, dum viveret, ora- 
rent Monachi; postmortem, funus corpusque exciperent, atque 
animam de corpore abeuntem, per continua sacrificia et opera pie- 
tatis prosequerentur." His charter is confirmed by Pope Gregory 
III. Rom. Julii, pontificatus sui anno quarto. The ruins bear no 
trace of turret or steeple, and are entirely destitute of sculpture or 
ornament; but the area they enclose is nearly covered with tomb- 
stones of an unknown antiquity. The north aisle belongs to 
the Mackenzies of Gairloch, and the effigy of a recumbent knight 
in full panoply under an arched canopy, marks the resting-place of 
Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, eighth laird of Kintail, who died in J 493. 
The other divisions of it consist of the burying-grounds of .the 
principal branches of the clan Fraser, of the Chisholms, and other 
tribes of Strathglass. From the total absence of letters on many 
of the tombstones, it may be inferred that writing was unknown 



INVKRNESS-SIIIRFC. 

in this country wlien these were constructed. The earliest inscrip- 
tions are dated 300 years after its foundation. They are all in 
the Saxon character, and are formed on the margin of an effigy of 
the deceased. On the north side of the front door, there is an im- 
pression similar to that made by the fingers of a man's hand : and 
the following legend commemorates the origin of that impression ; 
A report having gone abroad that a stranger from the invisible 
world was paying his nightly visits to the priory, there was a gene- 
ral dread of approaching it after sunset. A tailor in the neigh- 
bourhood, engaged, however, to finish two pairs of hose in it on a 
certain night, at an appointed hour. While he was busily occu- 
pied in performing his task, there appeared before him a huge spec- 
tre, stretching out its bony arm, and exclaiming, " See, tailor, a 
great hand without flesh and blood to which the valiant tailor re- 
plied, " I see that, and I sow this." The same expression was uttered 
thrice, and the tailor's work being finished, he rose to depart, 
when the spectre pursued with uplifted hand, attempting to strike 
him. The hand, however, missed its aim, and struck the side of 
the door, upon which it left the impression of its fingers. 

On the Muir of Ord, to the east of Beauly, there are two up- 
right stone pillars, nearly six feet high, commemorative of a feat 
of ancient warfare, and connected, it is said, with a prophecy re- 
garding the extinction of the clan Mackenzie. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of this parish ex- 
tend as far back as the sixteenth century; but, from the irregular 
manner in which they have been kept till within the last thirty or 
forty years, no information of importance can be derived from 
them. 

Land-oioners — The landed proprietors of the parish are, the 
Honourable Lord Lovat, and Chisholm of Chisholm. 

III. — Population. 

The population of the parish at the time of the last Statistical Account was 2318 

by the census in 1831, . ... 2709 

of the village of Beauly, . . _ . 508 

Consequently the country population amounts to - - 2201 

The increase of population during the last thirty years has been 
principally owing to the influx of people from other quarters into 
the village of Beauly. The native inhabitants have increased but 

' In the house of the priests who officiated in this priory, Queen Mary, it is said, 
was entertained for a night ; and upon seeing in the morning the beautiful view 
from its windows, she exclaimed, " C'est un beau lieu j" and hence the name, Beau- 
ly, was given to the village and river.

little. The letting of large tracts of land to single individuals has 
occasioned the banishment of many of them, who, for many gene- 
rations, possessed the soil. They have been forced to seek an asy- 
lum in a foreign land, where they enjoy Nature's bounties in richer 
abundance. 

In a parish of such extent, it is impossible to ascertain with 
exactness the number of deaths, marriages, and births. Of the 
first no register is kept ; and there are so many Roman Catholics 
in the Highland part of it, that even the marriages and births can- 
not be ascertained. Of the Protestant , population, however, the 
average number of baptisms for the last seven years may be reckon- 
ed at 46 annually ; and marriages, 9. 

The number of insane persons in the parish is 14, and of blind, 4. 

Character and Habits of the People. — In many of the western 
parts of the country, the march of improvement has been very 
slow, and the strongholds of superstition are not yet demolished. 
The people are in general below the middle size, but uncom- 
monly hardy, and capable of enduring privation. They are 
fond of performing long journeys in the night season ; and it is 
nothing strange to see a married man travelling with his horse and 
cart a distance of thirty miles, without a bonnet on his head. The 
. language generally spoken in the inland part is the Gaelic, while, 
in the eastern extremity, few are found, who cannot speak the 
English. There is among all classes an earnest desire that their 
children should acquire a knowledge of the latter. Little can be 
said in praise of their sobriety. The quantity of ardent spirits 
consumed is immense. A great deal, however, of that rioting at 
marriages and funerals, which formerly existed, has been done 
away with. Their favourite amusements are shinty matches and 
dancing. They are particularly fond of being neat and clean : 
and the ambition for articles of finery is widely spread among the 
rising youth. Poaching and smuggling are now almost discon- 
tinued. 

IV. — Industry. 
From the great extent of this parish, and the various directions 
in which the large and small farms lie, the number of acres 
which are cultivated, in pasture, or under wood, cannot with any 
certainty be determined. On the Lovat property, about 2000 
acres may be in tillage ; while, on the estate of the Chlsholm, 
the average is about 900. The upper district of the parish is 
in general pastoral ; and much attention is not paid to tillage, 



368 



INVEUNESS-SHIUE. 



except to obtain what is requisite for family use. There are 
many thousand acres under wood, partly natural and partly 
planted. Great attention is bestowed on the management of 
trees ; they are thinned annually, and most of the fir trees felled 
are sold for railway sleepers; while the birch is manufactured 
into staves for barrels. 

Rent of Zf/wc.— The rent of arable ground varies with the qua- 
lity of the soil. A few lots are rented at L. -4, 10s. and L. 4 
per acre; many large farms at L. 2, L. 2, 5s. and L.2, 10s.; 
many others from L.l, 10s. to L.l. The average rent may be 
stated at L.l, 15s. per acre. The average rent of pasture is 
reckoned at L.4 or L.4, 10s. for each ox or cow, including pro- 
vender for winter. Hill pasture, however, in summer, with pro- 
vender in winter, may be obtained for L.l, 10s. The average 
rent paid for a ewe or full-grown sheep pastured for a year, is from 
2s. 6d. to 3s. 

Wages. — Farm-servants are usually hired for the year. If 
married, they receive, together with a small dwelling-house, 
from L. 12 to L. 15 a year; 6 barrels of coals; 6 bolls of oat- 
meal; and 6 bolls of potatoes. Some also receive pasture for 
a cow. Unmarried farm-servants frequently, and female-servants 
commonly, are boarded in their master's house, and receive only 
money wages, the former from L. 8 to L.IO, and the latter from 
L. 3 to L. 4 per annum. Common labourers receive Is. 6d. per 
day in summer, and Is. per day in winter without victuals. Masons 
and carpenters 2s. 6d. per day. Cheviot wool sell sat 14s. per 
stone, cross 12s. ; cheese 6s., and butter 18s. per stone ; meal 
from 17s. to 20s. per imperial boll; and potatoes from 7s. to 10s. 
per boll of 4 barrels each barrel containing 32 gallons.. 

Live-Stock. — Formerly, the sheep in the parish were the few 
possessed by the farmers for their own consumption; the rearing 
for the use of others was little attended to ; while now, the rich 
pasture of our country is occupied by thousands of the different 
breeds. The most common are the Cheviot and black-faced. 
Much attention is bestowed upon the improvement of this stock. 

Husbandry. — Improvements in agriculture have made rapid pro- 
gress in this parish, of late years. The mode pursued is not in- 
ferior to that in the most improved districts. Lime is generally 
used. Bone dust has also been lately introduced, for raising tur- 
nips, and with good effect. As the soil, in many places, is rather 
wet, a great deal of draining is required, which has only as yet been 



KILMORACK. 



partially effected. According to the terms of agreement, a regu- 
lar rotation of cropping is observed so far as soil and season will 
permit. The shift is every five years. The first year is generally 
bare fallow or potatoes ; 2d, wheat or barley ; 3d, grass ; 4th, 
grass ; and the 5th, barley or oats, but most commonly oats : after 
that, the land is dunged before the rotation commences again. The 
general duration of leases is fifteen years ; latterly, it has been 
increased to nineteen. The former of these is very unfavourable 
to the tenant, as it affords little time for making improve- 
ments. There are scarcely any enclosures in the parish; and, 
with very few exceptions, the farm-buildings are very indifferent. 
The deficiency of capital with many, and the want of encourage- 
ment by proprietors, are greatly felt as drawbacks to improve- 
ment. 

Quarries, Fisheries, and Manufactures. — The only quarries in 
the parish are of red sandstone : it is of inferior description, and 
used for common purposes. The only fishery is on the Beauly ; 
the annual rental of which is L.1600. Many thousand trees are 
annually cut down in the Lovat and Chisholm woods. These are 
sawn into square timber, planks, deal, staves, sleepers, &amp;c. for the 
home and English markets. 

Navigation. — There are only two small vessels belonging to the 
parish. A great number of vessels, however, from other quarters, 
trade to the place with coals, lime, &amp;c. : and in return, they are 
supplied with cargoes of wood. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Inverness, which 
is situate at the distance of eleven miles. The means of com- 
munication are excellent, inasmuch as the Parliamentary road 
traverses the whole length of the parish, and is kept in such 
excellent repair, that it may vie with the roads of more southern 
districts. 

The village of Beauly is pleasantly situate at the eastern ex- 
tremity of the parish. It is a village of some extent — having its 
principal street formed generally of slated houses, and exhibiting 
some well-stocked shops. A post-office has been established in it 
for the last fifty years ; the north mail daily passes through it ; 
and foot-runners go from it through various parts of the country. 
A sheriff- officer constantly resides in it ; and there has lately been 
established a branch of the North of Scotland Banking Company,' 
which promises to be of great advantage to the agricultural and 



370 



INVEUNESS-SHini;. 



mercantile interests of the district. The harbour is small, and not 
of the best description. The principal bridges in the parish are, 
the handsome granite one, of five arches, erected some years ago 
near the influx of the Farrar into the Glass; and the Lovat 
Bridge, built in 1810, across the Beauly. This latter bridge was 
built at an expense of nearly L. 10,000. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church stands a few miles from 
tbe eastern extremity of the parish, in a very convenient situation 
for the greater part of the population. The village of Beauly, and 
the space of four or five miles round about it, comprise nearly two- 
thirds of the population of the parish, that is a population of about 
1800. Of these, upwards of 100 are Roman Catholics, and about 
50 Episcopalians. The accommodation afforded by the church 
falls far short of what is required, as there are not sittings for one- 
third of the population. A few years ago, it underwent a thorough 
repair ; and now, as far as it goes, the accommodation is very com- 
fortable. The attendance on worship is generally good. The popu- 
lation of the upper district of the parish is chiefly Roman Catholic. 
The Committee of the General Assembly for the management 
of the Royal Bounty has, for many years, supported a Missionary 
to this and the neighbouring parish of Killarlity. He officiates 
for three successive Sabbaths at Cannich school, and the fourth at 
Glenstrathfarrar. 

The late Chisholni of Chisholm, two years ago, built a very neat 
church on his own property, which aff"ords accommodation to 300 
individuals. Though built in the parish of Kiltarlity, it is acces- 
sible to the inhabitants of Kilmorack. A fixed stipend of L.70 
per annum, with other perquisites, which amount to L.30, is to be 
granted by the present proprietor ; and it is expected, that, in a 
very short time, a minister will be ordained to the vacant charge. 
Worship has been performed in it, since it was opened, by the aid 
of the neighbouring clergy. 

In this district, also, two Roman Catholic priests officiate. They 
have two places of worship, capable of affording accommodation 
to upwards of 500. The one is situated at Wester Eskadale, on 
the south side of the Beauly ; the other lies at no great distance 
from the house of Fasnakyle. 

The manse is an old building, situated close by the parish 
church, on a rising eminence, whence a commanding view of 
the exquisite scenery around it may be obtained. The glebe 
is very small, and worth only L. 5 per annum. The amount 



KILMORACK. 



371 



of the stipend since its augmentation, in 1815, is, in money L.212, 
5s. 6d., 9 bolls of bear, and 24 bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, 2 lippies 
of meal, which includes L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 
The number of communicants connected with the parish is 84; 
but, including those from the neighbouring parishes, it amounts 
to about 300. Collections are occasionally made for the Gene- 
ral Assembly's missionary schemes ; and there is a contribution 
made to the Inverness Royal Infirmary once in three years. 

Education. — The number of schools is three — two parochial, 
and one supported by the Chisholm; but the parish has also the 
benefit of two schools which belong to the neighbouring parish. 
The salary of each parochial teacher is the minimum, with the legal 
accommodations. In some of the schools, the amount of school-fees 
does not exceed L.8 or L.IO, while in the 'principal they fall little 
short of L.20. The branches taught are, English and Gaelic read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, the elements of Algebra and 
raathemalics, Latin and Greek. The immense advantage in respect 
of education which the Strathglass district of this parish, for the 
space of twenty-three miles, possesses over many parishes in tlie 
Highlands, is entirely owing to the munificent generosity of the 
family of the Chisholm, — a family which it is impossible to men- 
tion without gratitude, for the benefits it has conferred on so large 
a portion of this dark and unenlightened district. There is still, 
however, a great deficiency of school accommodation in the village 
of Beauly. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 61 ; but occasionally, assistance is given 
to many others. The average sum allotted to each of those 
upon the poor's roll is 6s., 8s., and 10s. per annum. The 
only funds possessed by the parish are the collections at the 
church doors. They never amount to more than L.12 Sterling 
per annum; occasional donations are granted by the heritors. 
Few of the inhabitants go out of the parish in search of relief, and 
these only when compelled by necessity. 

Fairs.— On the Muir of Ord, is now held the most important 
cattle/air in the north of Scotland, for the purpose of accommodat- 
ing dealers from the south, and every part of the country. The 
following have been appointed as the days on which the market 
holds: \st market, the Muir of Ord, on third Wednesday of 
April ; 2c, second Wednesday of May ; Qd, second Wednesday 
of June ; Ath, third Thursday of July ; bth, third Tuesday of

are also four fairs annually held in the village of Beauly, during 
the months of May, August, October, and November. The Oc- 
tober and November markets are for the sale of country produce, 
that of August for engaging shearers. Little business is done at 
any of them. 

Inns. — There is one principal inn in the parish, which is kept 
in the most orderly manner ; but there are also nine public-houses, 
the effect of which upon the morals of the people is pernicious. 

Fuel — Pent is the principal fuel, which costs per cart load 
from Is. to Is. 6d. A great quantity of coals and wood is also con- 
sumed. 

MlSC:ffiLLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

Since the former Statistical Account was published, a better 
system of husbandry has been introduced— extensive lots of waste 
land have been reclaimed— the facilities of internal communication 
have been, and are increasing — farm-houses and steadings exhibit 
a more cheerful and commodious aspect— and there is more hap- 
piness and comfort in the abodes of the people. Still, however, 
there seems wanting among the tenantry, that sociality and mu- 
tual co-operation which can alone ensure success in any undertak- 
ing : for there is a deep-rooted antipathy in the bosom of High- 
landers to all those strangers from the south, who now occupy so 
many of the townships in the Highlands. The establishment of a 
district Agricultural Society would greatly tend to diminish this 
hostility, and diffuse a good feehug and unanimity amongst its 
members, which would be productive of immense advantage to the 
country.

PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. DAVID ERASER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Dores, anciently called Durris, is supposed to be de- 
rived from the compound word, in the Gaelic language, Tur-ri- 
ish, which, translated into English, signifies a rising ground near 
a loater. Such a rising ground there is in the parish, the sides of 
which are washed by Lochness. 

Extent, Sfc, — The parish is about 20 miles in length, and 3 or 
4 in breadth. It is bounded on the east, by the parish of Da- 
viot ; on the west, by Lochness ; on the north, by the parish of In- 
verness ; on the south, by Boleskine. 

T opographical Appearances. — The mountains, which inclose the 
valley on the north and south, protect it from all winds, except 
those from the west and east ; whereby, in hot seasons, the sum- 
mer heat is increased so much, that the corn and grass would be 
in danger of being quite parched, were it not for the night dews, 
that frequently fall in great quantities. In the high ground, there 
are several lakes and mountains, to the extent of which the arable 
land bears but a very small proportion. The soil, in some of these, 
has greatly the advantage over that of the low ground, and is very, 
productive, in seasons free from frost or much rain. 

II. — Civil History. 

Land- owners.— There are seven land-owners in the parish ; the 
chief of whom are, Lord Lovat, Lady Salton, W. F. Tytler, Esq. 
and Thomas Eraser, Esq. of Balrain. 

Mansion-houses — The chief mansion-houses are those of Al- 
dourie, Eregie, and Gortleg. 

Parochial Kejyzsfer..— Baptism and marriage registers were be- 
gun about the year 1744, but have not been accurately kept.

PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JOHN GRANT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
What is now called the parish of Pettie comprehends the 
united parishes of Bracholy and Petyn, situate within the an- 
cient province or diocese and the modern synod of Moray, and 
in the county and presbytery of Inverness ; with the exception 
of a pendicle of Lord Cawdor's property, called Calder's Braich-' 
lich, which is valued in the county of Nairn. The earliest men- 
tion of these parishes is in the " Registrum Episcopatus Moravi- 
ensis," or Chartulary of Moray. They formed a united parish pre- 
vious to the Reformation, under the charge of" the vicar of Petvn 
and Bracholy," who was a prebendary of the Elgin cathedral, and 
appointedto do duty there by a deacon. The church of Petyn 
was dedicated to St Columba ; for in the Chartulary, page 43, the 
vicar records himself as a witness to the deed of assignation of the 
first prebends, thus: " Ego, Walterus, Vicarius Sancti Columbae 
de Petyn subscribo." They are spoken of in the Chartulary as two 
churches; for, in describing the maintenance of the prebendaries, 
It is said, « de omnibus decimis garbarum infra parochias dictarum 
ecclesiarum unam scilicet de omnibus decimis infra parochias de 
Petyn et de Bracholy;" and among the " procurationes recen- 
tioris fevi," they are set down as « Ecclesite de Petyn et Bracholy 
concurrentes."t There was a glebe at each church. A field on 
Ballispardan is still known by the name of the Glebe, which it has 
maintained since an excambion was effected in 1762, and a piece 
of land given at the church of Petyn equal to the two glebes. 
They seem to have been always united as one parish since the 
Reformation. In the minutes of session of date June 30, 166-2, 
the people of Flemington are ordered to attend catechising in the 
church of Bracholy. A similar intimation is noticed March 18, 
1688. But at what time Divine service ceased to be alternately 
performed in each, we have not been able to ascertain.

INVERNESS-SnmE, 



Name. — The name Br.icholy, vulgarly called Braiclilicb, is obvi- 
ously derived from the church or district being situated above or 
behind the wood,  eaylais a hhraighe-choille J ; 'd wood at one time 
having grown on the declivity to the moss. The etymology of Pettie 
is by no means agreed upon. Could we be certain that the name 
Lunyn or Lunnin in the Chartulary refers to the farm of Lonie, ad- 
jacent to Castle Stuart, to the east of which is a delta of land, from 
time immemorial called the Island, or Island Ma-cmartin, and as i 
or inn means an island, — the names Lunyn and Petynmay perhaps 
have their etymons traced to the meadow, Celtic, Ion, and to 
the hollow, Celtic, pit, or to the promontory, Celtic, Fait hil- 
lock bi/ the island. The topographical description of Lunnin, 
given in the charter granted by the bishop, and confirmed by King 
William at Inverness, between 1 171 and 1184, corresponds to that 
of Lonie, to the east of which is the island. By that charter, the 
hermit, John, obtains exclusive right to the island, "quae est in lacu 
de Lunnin ab orientali parti." It lends some probability to our 
supposition, of Lunnin being Lonie in Pettie, that Bishop An- 
drew in his grant of lands to Walter de Petyn names the lands of 
Lunnin after those of Ardtrillen, Altirhes, part of the present 
Culloden property, with which Lonie is conterminous. It mili- 
tates, however, against our opinion, that Lunnin is spoken of as a 
church in connection with Croyn Croy, when Petyn and Bra- 
choly are spoken of as united churches. It seems scarcely pro- 
bable that there would be a church at Lonie, if the church of Pet- 
tie was in its present site, and that, too, connected with Croy ; 
unless, indeed, we suppose that the lake between Lonie and Petyn 
was such at one time as to render intercourse between the two 
. places somewhat difficult or impracticable, except by boat. Indeed, 
until Lord Moray, about sixty years ago, opened the main drain, 
the whole vale was a morass. At about the same distance as from the 
old church of Bracholy to Dalcross, there is, a:s we advance on the 
hill-side towards Inverness, Chapeltown ; and below it on the sea 
shore at Altirlie Point, where there are the traces of a burying- 
ground, tradition says that a chapel once stood, and that out of its 
ruins the boiling-house of the first salmon-fishers who came to the 
Point was built. It would thus appear that there was a succession 
of churches on the hill side, and others at the shore, every two of 
which were served as one cure. 

Extent. The length of the parish is about 8 miles along the 

 Chai tu'ary, p. 23. 



PETTIE.

shore of the Moray Frith ; or from about a mile from Fort George 
till it comes to within four miles from the town of Inverness. It 
varies from 2 to 3 miles in breadth, and extends about 9 miles on 
the interior side, connecting the parishes of Nairn and of Inverness. 

Boundaries and Figure. — The boundaries on the eastern and 
western extremities were, at one time, two brooks or burns, the 
courses of which can yet be traced, although the compulsory spirit 
of modern improvement no longer admits of their " wandering at 
their own sweet will." That which separates Pettie from Inver- 
ness, a little beyond the fourth milestone from that town, is called 
Ault-an-fhiler, or fiddlers' burn. It is now no better than a small 
drain, if it was ever much more, except after a heavy fall of rain 
or snow. That which separates Pettie from Ardersier on the east, 
formed at one time the boundaries between the properties of the 
Earls of Moray and Cawdor, where the villages of Stewarton and 
Campbelton now rise together. That burn has been, however, 
beyond the recollection of any one now living, turned to supp y a 
mill, and to empty itself into the sea, on the west, instead of, as 
originally, on the east side of Stewarton. On the south, the parish 
is bounded by Croy, and by the Moray Frith on the north. 

Topographical Appearances. — Though situated in the High- 
lands, and the entire population, till recently, speaking the Gaelic 
language, the parish is the reverse of mountainous. The land 
rises like a broken wave from the sea, in some places with a bank 
of considerable steepness and height, then sinks into a vale of moss 
land, from which, till reduced to cultivation, the town of Inver- 
ness used to be supplied with rushes : thence it ascends again to 
the parish of Croy, and the Moor of Culloden, which extend 
along the ridge. Towards the sea the soil is of a clayey sand 
or of a light character. The Braes, as they are called, form- 
ing the ascent from the moss to Croy, are of a stronger and 
more fertile quality of soil. Several brooks fall over a bed of 
rocks into the vale ; and from the advantage of these streams, 
some of the farmers in the braes and low grounds have thrash- 
ing-mills which are wrought by water. From this advantage, 
smuggling was very common, formerly, among the small farmers in 
the braes ; and when they were removed, one of the first tenants 
of the enlarged farms, a Mr Collie, established a distillery, which 
was carried on, for several years, till his death. Even the greatest 
winding along the shore scarcely deserves the name of bay. It is 
between Altirlie Point, where a commodious harbour could be

formed, and the promontory on which the church is built. On 
this beach, coals and lime are landed, and further east, on the 
beach of Connage, towards Campbeltown and Fort George, the 
woods cut down in the eastern district are shipped. As nothing 
greater than a boulder is found along this sandy shore, vessels 
could land their cargo at any place, except for the danger of the 
tides being too low to carry them off. The sea recedes to a great 
distance at low-water, except at Altirlie Point, where, in conse- 
quence of the water receding very little, families from Inverness 
frequently take lodgings during summer and autumn, in the fishing 
village, and with the neighbouring farmers, for the purpose of sea- 
bathing. 

Meteorology. — The climate of the parish is of the same cha- 
racter with that which prevails along the coast of Moray ; and 
were the soil as rich as the climate is genial, no district in Scot- 
land would surpass it in fertility. The superior farmers note, oc- 
casionally, in their books, the character of the weather, especially 
in seed-time and harvest, but, except by the writer, whose register, 
however, is of too recent a date and too irregularly kept to be of 
any use, no observations on the temperature by the thermometer, 
nor estimates of the quantity of rain by the guage, have ever been 
systematically made in the parish. 

The following notices of the time of sowing and reaping are 
taken from the farm-books of John Gollan, Esq. of Gollanfield, 
and James Strother, Esq. one of our most intelligent and systema- 
tic farmers.

farm, J. Gollan, Esq. of Gollanfield, has recorded his sowings as 
follows : — 

• For the last four years less wheat has been sown in November, which presents 
a greater breadth of barley in spring, and accounts for the lateness of concluding the 
spring sowing. The harvest is generally concluded in six weeks. In 1826 it re- 
quired eight weeks.

Dr James Tolmie of Campbeltown writes, " The medical to- 
pography of Pettie presents few of those features which are pro- 
ductive of insalubrity. A line of morass, extending with occa- 
sional breaks through nearly the length of the parish, exhibits, 
from the improved system of agriculture and draining, a continua- 
tion of fertile fields, rather than a source of marsh miasmata. 
Indeed, indigenous cases of intermittent fever are very rare. 
The climate in summer and autumn is dry and bracing ; but in 
the winter months, the cold and humid south-west wind, to which, 
from lying in the mouth of a mountain defile, the parish is much 
exposed, is sharply felt. In common with the parishes around it, 
it presents a fair proportion of the maladies of our climate, al- 
though it is not distinguished by the prevalence of any particular 
disease. Erysipelas and rheumatism may be said to be common. 
In tracing the etiology of the former, when it does not appear 
in an epidemic form, a morbid predisposition may with more 
justice be attributable to exposure to cold and wet, and to other 
causes, than to any insalubrious locality. As a therapeutic agent 
in this exanthem, the peasantry place implicit confidence in the 
virtues of the herb Geranium Robertiaiium, used internally in the 
form of decoction, and externally as a stupe. I believe its efficacy 
to be more traditional than real, and probably entitled to the 
same praise as another curative process in this disease, often 
adopted by the Highlanders, which is the application of a piece 
of scarlet cloth to the inflamed skin. This latter is of great an- 
tiquity, possibly a Pictish relic. Whilst the matrons profess a 
thorough knowledge of ' baleful weeds, and precious juiced flow- 
ers,' they evince anything but discrimination in the use of them. 
Thus the Glechoma hederacea, an useless herb, is administered in 
almost every disease ' that flesh is heir to.' And, as showing the 
remote antiquity of the use of some herbs, and their extensive ce- 
lebrity, it may be mentioned, that the plantain leaf, Plantago 
major in Gaelic, slan-lus, which, upwards of two centuries and a- 
half ago, was declared by our great English bard to be ' excellent 
for your broken shin,' is here very generally known, and applied 
to recent wounds and old ulcers. If instances of longevity con-

stituted the comparative salubrity of a place, this parish may be 
said to possess it. But the want of mortuary registers, &amp;c. ne- 
cessarily renders this branch of medical statistics imperfect." 

Hydrography. — There are several excellent and copious springs. 
There are some at the very top of the highest and sandiest part 
of the bank of the sea, and others on a level with the sea, and 
overflowed by it, at every high tide. Below the promontory on 
which the church stands, there is one with a copious rill, proved 
to be of the most uniformly cold temperature in the neighbourhood 
of Inverness. At Tornagrain there is tobar na gul or the 
boiling fountain, where, on a level flat, there are various inter- 
mittent spouts, and with every ejection of the water, the purest 
sand rises and spreads round the orifice from which the water is 
thrown, till the weight of the sand changes the orifice, and this 
sand is distributed by the same process anew. At Culernie is 
tobar na clerich. Between Culblair and Mid Coul, is Bruach-na 
fuaran, or Brae of the Well, where the old inhabitants say Loch- 
andunty empties its waters. Some of the farmers, however, towards 
the sea shore, are put to inconvenience from deficiency of water, 
if there be any continued drought in summer. 

From a register of observations, &amp;c. kept by Mr Adam, Ex- 
Rector of the Inverness Academy, we give the temperature of 
the two first mentioned springs. The spring at the church, Mr 
Adam found, during the whole years of 1821-22, to be uniformly 
at 47° Fahrenheit; but Tobar na gul varied in 1821, between 
45|° and 46°, and in 1822, between 45|° and 45°. 

Lakes. — The only lakes or lochs we have to mention are Loch 
Flemington and Lochandunty  Lochan-dun-duibh,  the loch of 
the black hillock. They are both situated on the ridge towards 
Croy, and in the old parish of Bracholy. 

Geology. — " The ridge which bounds the parish on the south 
belongs to the old red sandstone formation, and its bed consists 
either of red or of a bluish-grey micaceous sandstone with little 
or no conglomerate, and no subordinate layers, except a few thin 
ones of limestone and a bituminous shale, which is not abundant. 
No scales or other impressions of extinct fishes or other organic 
remains have as yet been found, though, on the south side of the 
ridge, on the estate of Cantray, the sands there have been found 
to exhibit traces of sauroid reptiles." 

It requires little skill in decyphering the monuments of past

revolutions on the earth's surface, to be able to trace the appear- 
ances and formations of the undulating plain, lying between the 
foot of the ridge and the shore of the Frith, to aqueous causes. 
Some seem inclined to regard the appearances which this district 
presents, as indicative that it once formed the estuary, on which 
the waters which flowed from the Great Glen of Scotland strug- 
gled with those of the Moray Frith ; and that the undulating sur- 
face consists of the accumulation of sand and soil then thrown up, 
and before which the sea has retreated. Others have adopted the 
theory, that the sea formerly covered a channel, extending from 
the Moray Frith to the western coast, along the Great Glen, 
or the line of the Caledonian Canal ; and that the land which 
now separates the two seas is an upheaved bed or beach of the 
sea. Whatever facts other districts may furnish in support of 
these views, nothing has been brought to light in this parish, 
so far as we know, which would indicate that the formations in the 
plain are from marine deposit. Lyell, in his account of the en- 
croachments of the sea on the land in different places round our 
island, notices, that " there have been inroads of the sea at Fort- 
George, and other places in Morayshire, which have swept away 
the old town of Findhorn." This supposes the sea to have ad- 
vanced inwards in the Glen, and not to have retreated. Anterior 
to such irruption of the sea, the parish must haveformed the basin 
of a fresh water lake, and the formations must be the effect of a 
fluviatile, not marine deposit. 

The greatest excavations which have been made in the lowest 
parts of the vale do not penetrate deeper than, if so deep as, the pre- 
sent level of the water in the Frith. The lowest stratum is compos- 
ed of arenaceous clay and marl, rarely capable of being applied to 
any useful purpose. It is not unlikely that this rests on the sand- 
stone on which Fort- George is built, almost in the very . waters of 
the Frith. This lower stratum forms the bed of the moss ; and 
on it, where the ground ascends from the moss, we find superim- 
posed a stratum of very varying thickness, of a very fine white and 
compact dead sand. On the top of this, and sometimes in its 
mass towards the top, are very thin layers of sand, looking as if 
coloured with oxide of iron. In some places there is no soil over 
this sand — not a sufficient growth of grass to conceal it — but a 
feathering of broom, rising so spontaneously, as to show that, if it 
were not uprooted for fuel by the poor, the surface would soon be 
clothed with it. On nuch of the land in cultivation the broom 



382 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



threatens to dispute the ground, if left under grass three years. 
In other places a kind of sandy loam, varying from a mere sprink- 
hng to the depth of many feet, covers the compact sand : and to- 
wards the east, soil of a less sandy, but more stony character, and 
less pervious to water, is found. Such stratification gives evidence 
of an aqueous sediment, very gently and gradually deposited in all 
but the uppermost stratum. From the height above the present 
level of the Frith, to which the deposit has been made, the waters 
of the lake must have flowed a considerable distance before they 
emptied themselves into the sea, or else the whole basin— from 
Beauly to Fort- George— has been uniformly upheaved, because the 
ground at these extremes presents corresponding elevations. But 
whether at the period when the sea broke in at Fort-George, and 
gained upon the land along the shores of the Moray Frith at Find- 
horn, there was a convulsion of nature, by which the lacustrine 
basin of Pettie was elevated, and the shores at Findhorn depres- 
sed ; or whether the sea only gradually ate away the eastern bar- 
rier, so as to drain the lake while it made a farther entrance for 
itself, we have no means of determining. 

There is evidence, that, on the beach between Campbelton and 
Fort- George, the sea has encroached upon the land; for I have 
heard Dr Tolmie repeatedly say, that he has dug up peat-moss, 
bearing the evidence of terrestrial flora, nearly two hundred yards 
within flood-mark. But, except at this place, at Campbelton, where 
the waves, deflected from Chanonry Point, would soon cut their 
way, unless obstacles were interposed, into the moss of Pettie, and 
reduce the bank between that and Castle Stuart to an island, 
which it obviously once was, the land is gaining from the sea 
along the rest of the coast of Pettie. For there are now fields of 
cultivated land, and stretches of pasture, bearing obvious marks 
of being reclaimed sea-beach. We wish we could ascertain whe- 
ther there be any difference between the soundings lately made, in 
the Trigonometrical Survey of this coast, and any previous sound- 
ings, so as to show the rapidity with which, it is likely, the Frith is 
adding to the land between Inverness and Fort- George.

century, with the exception of some few particulars, may be class- 
ed with that of the ages of fable and romance. By that time we 
find the name of Petyn noticed in history ; and mention made of 
a fortalice or castle, which seems to have been erected either as 



PETTI13.

defence in case of invasions by the Danes from the sea, or as a 
stronghold, in order to retain possession of the country upon the 
subjugation of the Moraymen in the reign of Malcolm IV. 

The ancient territory of Petty and Brachly, comprehending at 
least the whole modern parish, first occurs in record as part of the 
possessions of a branch of the great family of De Moravia, who 
seem to have held these lands as Jirmarii, or tenants of the Crown, 
from the end of the twelfth century ; and, early in the thirteenth, 
Walter De Moravia conferred the parsonage tithes of the churches 
of Petty and Brachly on the cathedral church of Moray, of which 
they thenceforward formed one of the prebends, the patronage 
remaining with the family of the granter. 

In 1226, Bishop Andrew enters into an agreement with Wal- 
terus de Petyn, relative to the lands of Ardtrillen, Lunyn, Dul- 
davy, and Croyu, which lands his father, William, it is said, had 
held, and affirmed that they belonged to him by hereditary right. It 
is not improbable that Petyn had been possessed by Freskyn himself. 
In charter 61 of the chartulary of Moray, which establishes pre- 
bends in Elgin cathedral, this is said to be done as to Pettie and 
Bracholy, with the consent of Walter de Moravia, then patron. 
In the preface to the chartulary we have an account of successive 
possession of these lands by Sir Andrew Murray, and Archibald 
the Grim, third Earl of Douglas, by his marriage with the heiress 
of Bothwell and Pettie. 

It is probable that the lands of Petty and Brachly formed part 
of the territory contained in the successive erections of the Earl- 
dom of Moray ; while, at the same time, the neighbouring fami- 
lies of Mackintosh and Kilravock had acquired some title to va- 
rious parts of them, under which the former occupied the lands 
of Hallhill, and the latter those of Flemington and Easter Brach- 
ly, until the old tenure of Flemington was changed into a feu from 
the Earls of Moray about the beginning of the seventeenth cen- 
tury. The greater part of the parish is still the property of the 
Noble family of Moray. 

The family manuscript history of the Mackintoshes, in posses- 
sion of the chief at Moyhall, states, that the Mackintoshes became 
possessed of Pettie and Bracholy, formerly possessed by the Mo- 
raymen, who were entirely destroyed in the rebellion. 

In 1281, the Earl of Ross, having injured the churches of Pe- 
tyn and Bracholy, came to terms with the church, by assigning 
the lands of Kattepol and Pitkanny to the Elgin cathedral, as a

propitiation for his own soul, the souls of his wife and children, and 
all his predecessors, and all his successors. Charter 220. 

The people of Pettie were engaged in the battle of Clachna- 
herry, see Sir R. Gordon or Brown's History of the Highlands, 
Vol. 1. p. 151, for the Moyhall manuscript states, that the fiery 
cross was sent by Mackintosh to Pettie, calling out the people to 
the pursuit of Munro of Fowlis. 

In 1368, the Moyhall manuscript makes William, the seventh 
Laird of Mackintosh, to have his residence in Connage, Pettie. 

From 1314, when the Crown lands in Moray were'erected into 
an earldom by King Robert Bruce, and bestowed on his nephew, 
Randolph, Pettie seems to have always formed part of the lands 
belonging to the Comitatus or Earldom of Moray. 

In 1455, Shaw, Part II. the lands of the Earldom were an- 
nexed to the Crown ; and some time after the Laird of Findlater 
held the barony of Pettie of the Crown, and afterwards of the 
Earl of Moray. 

In 1495, the Moyhall manuscript states, that the Earl of Hunt- 
ly kept possession of Connage, sixteen years, till King James V. 
was born ; at which time the feu of Petyn was given by Kino- 
James IV. to Sir William Ogilvie of Banff, because his wife", 
called Nannie Pant, an English woman, was the first advertiser 
of the birth of his son, James V. Sir William, shortly there- 
after, begged the Castle of Petyn, and dwelt therein till the Clan 
Chattan, under the conduct of Dougal Mor M'GhiUe Challum, 
besieged and burnt it, and slew a son of Sir William's, and eight- 
een men, whom they found there. Upon this the said Dougal 
put himself in possession of Connage, and chased John Ogilvy, 
possessor thereof, and brother of Sir William, with his wife and 
chddren, out of the country, and crushed the same for some five 
or six years, till himself and his two sons, Farquhar and Duncan 
Roy, were slain in the castle of Inverness. In a manuscript his- 
tory of the Roses of Kilravock, in possession of Dr Rose of In- 
verness, Hugh Rose of Kilravock, who is called a grandchild of the 
Mackintosh, is said to have aided in this destruction of Hallhill 
Castle, which is stated to have happened in or about 1513. The

circumstances which led to this violent proceeding on the part of 
the Mackintoshes are to be found detailed at length in Lesly'a 
and Sir R. Gordon's histories. They record it as occurring in 
1526, and give twenty-four of the Ogilvies as the nuniber killed. 
There are other discrepancies between the manuscript and the pub- 
lished histories. 

In May 1543, the Moyhall manuscript states that William, the 
fifteenth laird of Mackintosh, got a new liferent tack of Pettie and 
Brachly, from the Queen Regent. Likewise on May 15, 1546, 
being Saturday, Mackintosh, in revenge for what had been done 
by the Clan Ronald, at Abertarf, in July 1544, to the people of Pet- 
tie, did harry and spoil all the lands of Glengarry, and killed such 
of the people as made opposition. In 1548, Mackintosh having; 
received Lachlan, the son of John Malcolmson, into favour, gave 
him possession and tenandry of Connage. 

In 1548, The Earl of Huntly had the Earldom of Moray be- 
stowed upon him : and about two years afterwards, in virtue of the 
powers with which he was entrusted, as Lieutenant- General in the 
north, he seized and put to death the chief of the Mackintoshes, 
and declared his lands to be forfeited. It was believed that Lach- 
lan Mackintosh, a near kinsman of the chief, had falsely accused 
or betrayed the chief to Huntly. At all events, the fact, that Lach- 
lan was made, by Huntly, joint sheriff-depute of Inverness, with 
Munro of Fowlis, and Chamberlain of the lands of Pettie, gave 
colour to the imputation. Determined not to let the murder of 
their chief go unrevenged, the clan Chattan entered the Castle of 
Petyn by stratagem, the last day of September 1551; apprehend- 
ed Lachlan, and slew him. Moyhall MS. Greater commo-

tion might have ensued, says Sir R. Gordon, but for the prudence 
of the Queen Regent, who recalled the act of forfeiture. 

The Mackintoshes seem never to have forgiven the Earl of Hunt- 
ly the murder of their chief. For, besides obeying with reluctance 
his commands, even when he was clothed with a royal commis- 
sion, they took every opportunity of wasting his estates. 

In 1561, Queen Mary conferred the Earldom of Moray on her 
brother, the Regent. 

Upon the murder of the bonny Earl of Moray at Donnybristle in 
1591, by the Earl of Huntly, the Mackintoshes of Pettie, under the 
conduct of Angus of the Brazen Face, the intrepid head of the house 
of Kylachy, who lived at Culerney, Pettie, and whose impudence 
and prowess still form the subject of a winter's evening tale, ra- 
vaged Strathdee and Glenmuic, and slew, with others of local note, 
tlie old Baron of Bregley ; Huntly retaliated by wasting and spoil- 
ing the district of Pettie, and killing many of the Mackintoshes. 
Huntly had scarcely returned home and disbanded his army, when 
he was informed that the Mackintosh, 800 strong, had invaded Ach- 
indown and Cabrach. 

This outrage led to his making a second expedition into Pettie, 
in which he left traces of his vengeance, of a more terrible charac- 
ter than he did in the former. The Kilravock manuscript con6rms 
these accounts of Huntly's raids given us by Sir R. Gordon. 

" The Earl of Huntly, Allan M'Dhomhuil Duibh, Lochiel, 
Macronald of Glengarry, designing an expedition against Pettie 
and the clan Chattan, give assurance under their hands to Hugh 
Rose, that himself, kin, and tenants, should be free from their ar- 
mies, March 18, 1592-3." 

Spalding and Sir R. Gordon contain an account of a com- 
motion of rather an alarming character, which had arisen in 
1624, when the Earl of Moray brought north an army of his de- 
pendents from Doune, Menteith, and Balquidor, and began to dis- 
possess the Mackintoshes of lands which he had given' them in 
Fettie. 

 In the Inverness Courier, there appeared, some months ago, a statement of an- 
cient rentals. The proprietor of that journal informs me, that it was found by John 
, Macqueen, Esq. among some old law papers. It is entitled " The Book of the Va- 
lued Rents of the Sheriffdom of Inverness and Ross, as the same was appointed and 
rectified by the Commissioners appointed by the Act of Convention of Estates."

It was on this occasion that Duncan Forbes, Provost of Inverness, 
the first of the Culloden family, went to London with a remon- 
strance to the King against the oppressive proceedings of the Earl 
of Moray : and it might have been, both on account of the annoy- 
ance which they received from the Earl of Moray at this period, 
and as an acknowledgement of what they owed to the friendship of 
the provost and inhabitants of Inverness, that the Mackintoshes, in 
1626, sold their estate of Culloden to Duncan Forbes. In the ge- 
nealogy of the family of Forbes by M. Lumsden, reprinted with 
additions at Inverness in 1819, by the late Major Duff of Muirtown, 
we are informed, that, when this purchase took place, the old " cas- 
tle was built up but to the second story, and that this estate was 
afterwards much enlarged by the purchase of lands contiguous, 
made from Lord Moray, Lord Lovat, the town of Inverness, Rose 
of Altirlies, and Rose of Kilravock. It is a curious fact, that it 
was never known which half of Altirlies belonged to either proprie- 
tor; and there is an elder in this parish, Mr David Eraser, late 
of Breachnish, who recollects that his father, and all the tenants, 
in paying their rent in kind, used to go with the one-half to Bal- 
nain, and with the other to Culloden House. 

Next in importance, in territorial extent, to the property of 
Culloden, was that of Flemington, at the period when the former 
Statistical Account was written. In the notice of the seventh 
laird of Kilravock, in the manuscript to which I have already re- 
ferred, it is said, " this Hucheon was the king's tenant on the lands 
of Flemington, Easter Brachlie and Hallhill, within the lord- 
ship of Pettie." A gentleman possessed of intimate knowledge 
of the antiquities of the province of Moray, writes to me, " there 
are symptoms of Flemish intercourse, and even of Flemish co-

Mr Macqueen conjectures the original to have been prepared early in the seven- 
teenth century. It is probably the Macintoshes mentioned here whom Lord Moray 
dispossessed. 

• The first trace we can find of the title to one-half of Altirlies, Breaknish, and 
fishmgs, is a charter under the Great Seal, dated 20th January, and sealed 8th Fe- 
bruary 1688, in favour of George Gumming, merchant-burgess of Inverness, and 
Robert Ross, name-son of the Provost of the burgh. On the death of James Gum- 
ming, son of George the succession opened to James Hay Gumming, his son, who 
lUoo P"""" '23, disponed the lands to Alexander Mackintosh of Termit. In 
1723-25, he sold the lands and fishings for 7000 merks to John Forbes of Gulloden, 
eWer brother of the Lord President. The lands of CuUernies, of which the Earl of 
Moray is superior, came into the possession of the family of Culloden in 1730; and 
about 1768, the other half of Altirlies, of which the superior is Eraser of Balnain, 
was purchased by John Forbes of Culloden, great grandfather of the present proprie- 
tor, Arthur Forbes, Esq. » fa fa

Ionization in so many parts of our eastern coast, that it seems 
reasonable to take the name as it stands, and to suppose it to mark 
an early settlement of some enterprising or discontented colony 
from Flanders. Hugh, the seventh laird of Kilravock, had an as- 
sedation of these lands from King James IV., 6th July 1439, which 
narrates the previous possession by his family. Many subsequent 
leases are preserved in the Kilravock charter chest. In July 
1639, the Earl of Moray, having then acquired the lordship, 
changed the leasehold into a feu, and the lands of Flemington and 
part of Bracholy continued to be held in feu of the Moray family, 
as far down as I have investigated." The manuscript already quot- 
ed, records that Flemington was obtained from the Earl of Moray 
for 3000 merks, since the Earl, being very kindly, gave them a 
good bargain. Shaw in his history of Moray, Part ii. Family of 
Kilravock, gives a minute account of the manner in which, by a de- 
cision of the House of Lords, 1787, Flemington became separated 
from the Kilravock estate. Since the last Statistical Account was 
written, Flemington has been sold. Flemington is now divided 
into two estates. The chief part, now called Gollanfield, has 
been purchased by the present proprietor, John Gollan, Esq. 
and the other part, perhaps about a sixth of the whole, by Major 
Fraser of Fort- George, who has retained the name of Flemington. 

Lord Cawdor is the only other proprietor in this parish. He 
possesses a narrow stripe of land descending from the ridge of 
Croy to the moss. It is called Calder Brachlaich, and from this 
name must have belonged to the family of Calder. There is no 
vestige of a record as to either the manner or the time in which 
it came into the possession of the Calders. The factor writes me, 
' the earliest charter I can find is of February 1662 ; but from it 
there seems no doubt that it was, long before that time, in the fa- 
mily, and is understood to be comprehended in the more general 
description of the thanage and barony of Calder, now called Caw- 
dor." The local tradition is, that Calder Brachlaich went as pin 
money, or to grow lint to one of the Earl of Moray's daughters, 
who married a laird of Cawdor. This account is, we think, un- 
founded ; for there is no evidence that the Earl of Moray ever pos- 
sessed it. It is not improbable that it was acquired by the Cald- 
ers, from Rose of Kilravock, and was at one time considerably 
larger. In the manuscript history of the seventh laird of Kilra- 
vock, it is stated that the Bishop Andrew and Hugh Rose, dis- 
puted their boundary ; and a story is told, which would imply that

Hugh was, by means of perjury, cheated out of part of his pro- 
perty by the Bishop. 

We close our civil history of the parish by noticing that, in the 
session records of November 1649, we have, on the 4th, this 
entry, " That day the minister made intimation to the elders to be 
prepared again the next day to give their oaths whether ilk ane of 
them did know of others anent the engagement and insurrection at 
Inverness. On the 5th, the elders underwritten being present, and 
being all sworn, deponed they knew nothing, but that they went 
to Moray and Inverness, with my Lord of Moray, their maister." 
They were desired to appear before the Presbytery at Inverness. 
The Presbytery, we regret to say, has no records earlier than 1702. 
And we have had no opportunity of consulting those of the town- 
council, to ascertain the cause or character of this insurrection, 
which is probably noticed in the records of the burgh. In the 
continuation of Sir R. Gordon's history, among other instances of 
anarchy which followed the death of Charles I., this year, it is record- 
ed, that, in February, Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, Colonel 
H. Fraser, and others, assaulted and took the town of Inverness, 
expelled the garrison, razed and demolished the walls and fortifi- 
cations of the town, pretending that the Parliament had sent pri- 
vate commissions to apprehend them; whereupon Lieutenant- Ge- 
neral D. Leslie was directed, with his forces, to apprehend them. 
The Kilravock manuscript says, " the Mackenzies, Frasers, &amp;c. 
take arms for the king, surprise and demolish the fortifications about 
Inverness ; but are defeated and dispersed by Colonel Ker and 
Major Strahan, at Balvonie. Our session records show, that the 
Earl of Moray was in the north at the end of the year, his pre- 
sence being probably required by the commotions which had 
arisen ; but what part he took in the local affairs of this neighbour- 
hood, at that period, we have not been able to ascertain. 

Eminent Characters. — The only individual of eminence con- 
nected with this parish by birth was Dr James Fraser, the liberal 
benefactor of King's College, Aberdeen. He was the son of Mr 
Alexander Fraser, minister of this parish from 1633 till 1683. By 
a note in Kennedy's History of Aberdeen, we learn that he enter- 
ed as a student in King's College, Aberdeen, about the time of the 

The records of the Inverness kirk-session may throw light on this rising. We 
have been told, that there are among the papers of Mr Robertson of Inches, letters 
written by the Earl of Moray, from Castlestewart to the Laird of Inches. The date 
has not been told us. They might throw light on the events of this period, or of 
1626, if examined.

Restoration, in the fifteenth year of his age; and, after complet- 
ing his education, took the degree of A. M. Having gone to 
England, he was entrusted with the care of several young men 
of quality, with whom he travelled on the continent. One of his 
pupils was the eldest son of the Earl of Berkley. He was afterwards 
appointed by Charles H. preceptor to the Duke of St Albans, and 
nominated Secretary of Chelsea Hospital. This office he held 
during the reign of James II., William and Mary, Queen Anne, 
and George I. He died in 1731, in the eighty-sixth year of his 
age. About the year 1725, he contributed about L.1400 Sterling 
towards repairing the College, and furnishing additional books to 
the library. Besides making this liberal donation, he founded two 
bursaries, — one in philosophy, and another in theology, — a short 
time before his death. He left his library, partly to the presbytery 
of Inverness, of which his father was a member, and partly to the 
College, and gave the presentation to the bursaries to the magis- 
strates of Inverness, with concurrence of the presbytery. By the 
careful and skilful administration of the Professors of King's Col- 
lege, Dr Eraser's mortification has so greatly increased, that addi- 
tional bursaries have been established upon it. 

Lord President Forbes is more connected with the parish 
as a proprietor than by residence. He was born at Bunchrew 
in Kirkhill, which, for more than thirty years, was his favourite 
residence, and the place where he pursued his studies and wrote 
his works. It is greatly to be regretted, that no memoir deserv- 
ing of the name exists of a man to whom Sir James Mackintosh 
pays this noble testimony in his review of the Culloden Papers : 
" There are various lords and lairds who make but a shabby figure 
in this collection. But our great pride and consolation is in the 
ever-clear honour and open heart of him to whom they address 
themselves. For Duncan Forbes no descendant will ever have 
to blush or feel ashamed ; and the perusal of this book will prove 
that Scotland, even since she ceased to be a separate kingdom, has 
had at least one statesman whose principles were as pure as his 
understanding was enlightened ; and whose concern for his coun- 
try was not so much as suspected to be quickened by any regard 
to his own power or emoluments." 

We wish we could mention Sir James Mackintosh himself as a 
native of the parish. His parents and ancestors, for many genera- 
tions, lived at Connage, although the family property was Kylochy,

where his father resided when Sir James was born. The family 
burying-ground, in which his father was the last who was interred, 
was within the walls in the east end of the old church of Pettie, 
on the foundations of which the present one has been erected. 

Besides the eminent names which we have mentioned, we are en- 
titled to notice also that of James Clark, Esq., who died at Naples 
about the close of the last century. He had evinced a genius for 
painting when a youth, and, by the aid of contributions from the lo- 
cal gentry, and some assistance from relatives, he was enabled to visit 
and reside for some time in Italy. In token of his attachment to his 
native country, and of his obligations to those who had befriended 
him, he bequeathed " to the Directors and Governor of the new es- 
tablished Academy in Inverness a picture of the Holy Family, Jesus 
Christ, the Virgin Mary, Joseph, and St John, by Sassoferato, to 
be placed in the hall of the Academy," where the picture is now 
to be seen. The records of the Inverness Academy contain the 
extract from his will, and the correspondence with his brother, Mr 
Alexander Clark, London. We have reason to believe that these 
gentlemen belonged to the Clarks of Pettie. 

We can claim but one native author, a man in humble life, who 
could neither write nor read. He died about two years ago, at the 
age of fourscore and upwards. He was a man, although eccentric, 
of decided piety and genius, and much esteemed by 5l who knew 
him. His memorial on earth is a small volume of " Spiritual Songs, 
by Donald M'Rae." Although this may fall into oblivion,— I 
fate which good judges say it does not deserve,— there is reason 
to believe that his record on high will be eternal. 

Antiquities.~T\ie chief object of antiquity is Castle Stuart, a 
fine and very entire specimen of the baronial architecture of the 
country during the period of feudal grandeur. It is remarkable 
for the extetat of its projections, square and round, which sprino- 
from a series of corbels, on several angles of the buildings. The 
date of Its erection, inscribed on one of the front windows, is 1625. 

i«o" ''•"g " event which had happened 

in 1624, describes the Castle as a house « now of late built." 

In the plantation opposite the school-house is Tom-a-mhoid or 
Court-hill, and Tom-a-chroich or Gallow-hill. The former is said 
to have been the favourite abode of fairies: and a story, is told 
ot a farmer s wife having been detained amongst them for a whole 
year, without being sensible of the lapse of time, and afterwards 
returnmg home, to the surprise and delight of her friends. It is

also said, that, about the commencement of my predecessor's in- 
cumbency, the fairies endeavoured to steal a new-born infant from 
its mother, at Lag-chree. Of this nefarious attempt, and of the 
sensation which it occasioned, there is a history in MS. by a vene- 
rable person who was parish schoolmaster at the time. 

When Darnaway was building, the joists of Castle Stuart were 
taken out, nearly to the entire destruction of its beautiful mouldings 
and friezes ; but they could be put to no use in the new edifice. For 
several years, the Castle had stood unroofed ; and from neglect, 
the heavy projections were tearing the walls asunder. Of late 
years, the eastern wing has been rendered habitable; the whole 
building has received a roof sufficient to preserve the walls ; and, 
by the introduction of long bars of iron, the progress of the rents 
in the walls has been stopped, and their existence can now scarcely 
be detected. The interior of the building is one open space, from 
the vaults which cover in the lowest story and form the floor of 
the second,, to the roof. The garden of Castle Stuart, about 
twenty-fiive years ago, was the favourite resort of the school-boy, 
who used to repair, from Inverness and other quarters, to it as a 
paradise in which to spend his holiday. The turrets of the castle 
could scarcely be seen at that time, surrounded as it was by an old 
and flourishing orchard. The Castle now stands in naked majesty, 
in an arable field, only distinguished from other fields, by a hedge 
of ash-trees, which have weathered some hundred winters. It must 
be added, that the destruction of the trees was accomplished with- 
out the knowledge and to the vexation of the Earl of Moray. In 
1796, when the Earl of Moray was made a British peer, he took 
the title of Lord Stuart of Castle Stuart. 

There are several of those circles of stones called Druidical 
circles. Besides those still existing, there were, about thirty years 
ago, two more on Flemington, the stones of which were taken to 
build the offices. On the farm of Hillhead, there is a large cairn, 
in the immediate neighbourhood of which a stone coffin was ex- 
cavated, many years ago. At Loch Flemington, there are what are 
supposed to be the traces of a Flemish camp. Some years ago, pis- 
tols rudely mounted with silver, and marked A. M. P., were found 
in the mud of the same loch, where they had probably lain since 
the battle of CuUoden. It is also said that a castle at one time 
stood on an island in this loch, and that in very dry summers its 
foundations can be discerned. A clay urn, protected m a frame 
of square stones, was discovered, in clearing the foundation for a

house, near the loch. On the farm of Bahtiuchree, there was a 
moat-hill, where stone-coffins containing urns were discovered. 
On the farm of Culblair, a shilling of Queen Elizabeth's time, 
as also a fragment of something like a battle-axe, delicately flow- 
ered, have been found in the moss. On the old Nairn road, 
at the boundary line between Petyn and Braclioly, is clack- 
an-tiiil, or holed stone, the use of which is unknown ; but the 
water collected in it was imagined to cure wens. The Messrs 
Anderson of Inverness, in their Guide to the Highlands and 
Isles, say, " Near the church are two of the largest tumuli, 
called moat-hills, in this country. The circumference of each at 
the base is 120 feet, and the height 42. On the south side of 
the bay, ao immense stone, weighing at the least eight tons, which 
marked the boundaries between the estates of Lord Moray and 
CuUoden, and called cluch-an-aban, or beach -stone, was, on the 
night of Saturday, 20th February 1799, carried forward into the 
sea 260 yards. Some suppose that nothing short of an earthquake 
could have moved such a mass ; but the more probable opinion 
is, that a large sheet of ice, which had collected to the thickness 
of lb inches round the stone, had been raised by the tide lifting 
the stone with it, and that their motion forward was aided and in- 
creased by a tremendous hurricane, which blew from the land." 
In the Edinburgh Wernerian Transactions for 1817-20, Sir T. 
Dick Lauder gives a minute account of this " travelled stone." 

There are places which, it is said, have derived their names 
from Fingalean heroes who were buried there. Among these 
Pipan and Ian Beay nam Fion may be mentioned. We must not 
omit what seems to be a notice of the latter, apigmy of 14feet, given 
us by Lesly. " Apud Moravos in eccelesia cujusdam pagiPetyn no- 
mine servantur ossa cujusdam Johannisquam antiphrasticos parvum 
appellant, qui vix tercentis ab hinc annis vita decessit, quem ossium 
vasta magnitude quatuordecem pedes longum fuisse docet. In hujus 
coxendicem nemo est apud nos, qui non manum simul et brachium 
facile immittere posset." The histories of Robin Hood make his 
friend Little John to retire like a smitten deer from his gay green 
wood and companions, in order to rest his weary bones in the dry 
sands of Petyn. To these we must add " Johannes eremites," men- 
tioned in the fourth charter of the chartulary ; so that there would 
seem to be some ground for regarding the name of the parish as 
Pait or Pit-Ian.

maglass, who was killed at the battle of CuUoden. It is said, that 
alter the battle, his body with fifty others was thrown into a pit • 
and, that so far did the King's troops carry their animosity, that 
tor six weeks they guarded the field, and would not grant the 
consolation to his friends of placing the body in the family bury- 
mg-ground. At the end of that period, it is said, that, by pouring 
some ankers of whisky into the opened grave, it was found possible 
to remove the body to the church-yard of Pettie. 

Smce the year 1606, when Lachlan, the third of that name, and 
sixteenth Laird of Mackintosh, was buried in Pettie, it has been 
the family burying -ground of the chiefs of clan Chattan. In 1651, 
Duncan Mackintosh was buried in Dunlichity, it being found 
impossible to bury him in Pettie, from the number of English 
troops then in the place.  The remains of four chiefs and two 
of their ladies are laid in the vault; the other members of the 
family are interred within the enclosure. Moyhall MS.. 

It is said that in 1746, when the Highlanders under'prince 
Charles found themselves at a loss for balls, they meditated a re- 
surrection of the chiefs and their ladies, with the view of convertino- 
the leaden coffins into bullets. ° 

III. — Population. 
Were one to form a judgment merely from the uncommonly 
crowded aspect of the churchyard, which is almost literally paved 
with all varieties of ancient tombstones, bearing the curiously 
wrought emblems of the avocations in which life was spent, and 
those of mortality blended together; or from witnessing the fre- 
quent funerals from neighbouring parishes, he would at once 
conclude that the parish must have been very populous in former 
times. This conclusion is supported by the evidence of the re- 
gister of marriages and baptisms for many years subsequent to 
1704. 

Average of both for seven years, from 1704 inclusive, bap- 
tisms, 62; marriages, 16 j and we must remember that there was 
less care in recording births at that period than in the present 
day.

small farms into large ones, was effected about twenty years ago on 
the Earl of Moray's property, were it not that a compensation was 
found for the decrease of tenants in the growth of the village of Stu- 
artown, and of hamlets on the property of Gollanfield. A few years 
ago, about fifty persons of all ages emigrated to Canada. Some fa- 
milies of fishers have also been obliged to remove from the parish ; 
some of them have gone to Tarbet Ross-shire, and others to 
Burghhead. The village of Stuartown on the Earl of Moray's pro- 
perty, whieh may be called the suburbs,. and forms about a third 
of Campbeltown in Ardersier, which is Lord Cawdor's property, 
and which is the only village in Pettie, contains about 30 families 
of fishers, pensioners, and labourers.

Only one heritor can be said to be resident, viz. the proprietor 
of Gollanfield. Members of the Earl of Moray's family spend, 
occasionally, a few days of the partridge-shooting season, in Castle 
Stuart. Major Eraser of Flemington, having duties to discharge 
as Acting Governor of Fort George, generally resides in the 
Fort. Neither of the other two heritors have a residence in the 
parish. 

Of insane and fatuous persons there are six, three of each 
sex : and there are three persons totally blind. 

Language. — English is the sole language of some of the fami- 
lies, but chiefly on the Earl of Moray's estate. The greater pro- 
portion of the farm-'servants, and all the old aboriginal tenantry, 
prefer to speak Gaelic. A man now living recollects the time when 
there was not on all the CuUoden estate, one who could tell a tra- 
veller the road to Inverness in English. Forty years hence, we ap- 
prehend it will be nearly as difficult to find many in the parish, 
who, if questioned in Gaelic, will be able to answer in that lan- 
guage. 

 Of these, six males were illegitimate.

INVEP.NESS-SIIIRK. 



The customs and habits of the people are more like those 
of a Lowland than of a Highland population. We may be per- 
mitted to notice two customs, said to have been common when 
the former Account was written. At marriages, which were 
wont to take place in the church, the children of the parish 
school were in the habit of barricading the door, and of refusing 
admittance to the party till the bridegroom should either mnke 
a present of fourpence to buy a new foot- ball, or earn exemption 
from the exaction by kicking the old ball over the church. If the 
bridegroom could not achieve the exploit of kicking the ball, or 
would not pay the pence, " the cleverest fellow might take off the 
bride's shoes," and thus degraded he might enter the church. At 
funerals, also, it was a custom peculiar to this parish to run as fast 
possible, so that often persons fell when carrying the body to the 
grave. Hence, in the neighbouring parishes, if rain came on, or if 
it was wished to quicken the progress of a funeral, it used to be 
said let us take " the Petie step" to it. This custom was revived 
a few years ago by some lads, at the funeral of a woman, known as 
Camronach-na-peasairach' s wife, and who was long dreaded and 
consulted as a witch. The Pettie step at funerals is now as decorous 
as that of their neighbours ; and the school impost at marriages 
has gone into desuetude. The fishers are the only class who now 
come, with a piper at their head, to be married in the church ; and 
till they muster in less force, it is the only place which can afford 
sufficient room.— The Highland costume is never worn as com- 
mon dress. 

Upon the whole, I would say, that the population are in as com- 
fortable and apparently contented circumstances as those of any 
Highland district. As to the tenantry, if the transmission of farms 
from sire to son for many generations, and the possession of means 
rather beyond what is requisite for their agricultural enterprise, be 
any evidence of their enjoying, in a reasonable degree, the com- 
forts and advantages of society, several of the aboriginal tenantry 
may be said to be contented with their situation. And if the prin- 
ciple, which has been acted upon by P. B. Ainslie, Esq., the Earl 
of Moray's Commissioner, and which, both from its equity, and no- 
velty at least in the north Highlands, deserves to be noticed, be 
taken as a criterion, and by which, instead of setting the farms up 
to roup, or accepting the highest offer in writing, as most of 
landlords do, the farm is valued by a competent judge brought 
from the south at his Lordship's expense, and is let, after a con-

siderate estimate and investigation, iu some instances, even at less 
than the tenant has actually offered, and under the valuator's appre- 
ciation, — if this be a system of dealing between landlord and tenant, 
embodyingthe favourite sentiment, " live and let live," — we may in- 
fer that, upon the whole, the tenants are satisfied with their cir- 
cumstances. And, since poverty is as often the parent as the off- 
spring of vicious habits, the character of the people, who are in 
general orderly and moral, may be taken as presumptive evidence 
that they are not ground down by the extortion of unreasonable 
landlords. 

Smuggling at one time existed, but it has entirely disappeared 
of late years. 

As to the religious state of the people, there is no denying that 
an universal opinion prevails in the Highlands, and it is not entirely 
confined to laymen, that piety was more flourishing in the days of 
their fathers than in their own day. If we consult, however, 
the records of session of this parish, it will be found, that the 
instances of gross immorality and indecency which crowd and 
contaminate their earlier pages, become gradually fewer as we 
approach the present day. Some of these have for years been 
unknown. ' From the habits of society in former days, when 
the Strathdearn feuars used to meet the tenantry of this parish 
and the factor at Castle Stuart, and spent not days but weeks in 
uncontrolled revelry, scenes were then witnessed, such, that the 
very mention of them makes people of ordinary stomachs thankful 
that they have been born out of season. On the other hand, we must 
recollect that, if a man was then actuated at all by religious princi- 
ples, he was obliged to stand more entirely apart from the common 
intercourse of society, and his religion would shine forth in stronger 
relief than would the character of the very same man if living now, 
when a general decency of deportment prevails. Besides, the 
absence of the variety of books and newspapers now circulated 
made our forefathers very much, and of necessity, men of one 
business and one book. Their small adjacent farms made it 
as convenient to them to meet often as if they dwelt in a village, 
and gave them neither poverty nor riches, but a competency and 
leisure. Frequent prayer and fellowship meetings became naturally 
the fuel and the fruit of piety in such a state of things. Such reli- 
gious men would be justly and greatly venerated as lights shinmg 
in a dark place. Besides, the custom unknown to the Lowlands, 
by which men of this description, at stated monthly meetings, and 
on the Friday preceding the dispensation of the Lord's Supper, 



398 



INVEllNESS-SUIUE. 



were called upon to express tlieir opinion or experience upon some 
religious question before the congregation, — gave them an opportu- 
nity of becoming prominent among their neighbours for any supe- 
rior knowledge, zeal, or eloquence. If the piety of the decidedly 
religious among our forefathers was thus more eminently exhibit- 
ed than that of the present time, the number of such individuals, 
it must be recollected, was but few ; the passions of the mass were 
far less restrained than in the present day, when decorum seems 
as if almost graduating into religion ; and it may safely be question- 
ed whether, on the whole, the former or the present state of things 
is to be regarded as the more flourishing, in a religious respect. 

In addition to non-resident proprietors, the parish labours un- 
der an almost greater evil — non-resident tenants. No proprietor 
who has the moral well-being of a community at heart should ever 
tolerate such a system. Its evils are obviously manifold. We 
question also whether the modern system of the entire absorption 
of small farms by large ones, will not ultimately tend to generate 
a worse moral-conditioned rural population, than if there were left 
a proportion of small farms,--establishment in which might be with- 
in the reach of industrious men, who had earned a character and 
small capital in serving the occupiers of the larger farms. It would 
be an advantage to the district, if, at some central points, such as 
where a smithy is found, a few small houses on the cottage system 
were erected, for a carpenter, gardener, merchant of small articles 
commonly in demand, tailor, and labourers. The members of all 
their families would be of service to the farmer at certain seasons of 
the year. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — Pettie may be described as an entirely agricultural 
parish, since the whole population, with the exception of the fish- 
ers, are employed directly in agriculture, or the subservient arts. 

The Earl of Moray's properties, " the lordship of Petyn," and 
the barony of Connage, comprise, apart from small crofts, 24 farms, 
at the average of about L. 160 of rent. The estate of Cullo- 
den in the parish contains, apart from crofts, 6 farms, at the 
average rent of L. 104. Gollanfield, now chiefly farmed by its 
proprietor, contains 7 farms, at the average rent of perhaps L. 60. 
Flemington contains, besides the Mains, one farm of about L. 50. 
The Mains may be of the same value. The rental of the parish 
is, including feus and crofts, fully L. 5000. 

The extent of the different estates is shown by the following 
tables :—

The harvest work is generally done by threaving, for barley and 
oats at 26.. per threave of two stooks, and 8d. for wheat; the 
sheaves 32 inches in circumference. When shearers are engaged 
for the harvest, the wages for men are from L.l, 15s. to L.2, and 
for women L.l, 4s. to L.l, 6s., with victuals ; and they are bound 
to assist in taking up the potatoes. The scythe is occasionally 
used by some of the farmers, but not to any great extent. Corn 
is never let out to be cut by the acre, except when a tenant may

be leaving bis farm, and has not the requisite establishment of ser- 
vants. In that case, it is generally let at about 9s. per Scotch acre, 
for cutting and stooking. 

The 1200 acres of plantations on Lord Moray's estates may be 
divided as follows :— About 200 acres of about 'the age of sixty 
years ; 250, thirty-two years ; 500, from fifteen to twenty years ; 
150 to 200, from one to ten years: including about twenty 
acres of oak coppice, managed in the most .approved manner. 
The cutting of wood on the estate extends little beyond what 
is required for thinning, and the supply of timber requisite for 
local purposes, such as in fences and the erection of farm-build- 
mgs. A vessel landing coals may occasionally obtain a cargo of 
props or deals. 

The only instance of sawing by a steam -engine ever seen in this 
district, took place in the manufacture of part of the woods of Cul- 
loden into staves, by that enterprising gentleman, J. Inglis Nicol, 
Esq. M. D., Inverness. So soon as the fir-wood on Lord Moray's 
estate is sufficiently' cleared, oak is planted in its stead. Major 
F raser has surrounded Flemington with a flourishing belting of fir, 
larch, and spruce. 

The parish is not remarkable for any particular breed of cattle, 
as attention is only paid to feeding and agriculture. Since few, if 
any, of the farmers have an outrun of pasture, the system pursued 
is. to purchase at the Moor of Ord and Bogbain trysts, stots for 
winterers, and sheep to eat off turnips. The dryness of the soil is 
favourable " to the feeding off"" of sheep; but this system is ob- 
viously regulated by the fertility of the season in the produce of 
straw and turnip. Some of the tenants, occasionally, let the run of 
their farms and a proportion of their turnips to sheep-farmers for 
the winter ; but no yearly average per head or per acre can well 
be stated. So seldom are fields let for grazing, or cattle received 
for this purpose, that it is almost impossible to state any average 
per head or per acre. The Aberdeen or Buchan black and pol- 
led breed of cows is preferred to the Ayrshire. Some of the 
farmers select for winterers the short-horned species, or crosses 
from that breed. But, in general, the stots are either of the High- 
land or Buchan breed. 

No leases under nineteen years are ever offered or taken. The 
landlords sometimes build all the offices, and, at other times, leave

tiie tenant wholly, or in part, to erect the buildings, as may happen 
to be agreed upon, when the lease is taken. 

The rule or understanding on the Earl of Moray's estate is, 
that the main drains or levels are kept in repairer efficient by the 
landlord, and the tributary drains by the tenant. 

There is a feeing-market for servants held at Inverness, about 
a month before each term. 

Wages. — The rate of wages for the half-year may be given as 
follows: — A foreman, from L. 6, 10s. to L. 8; a ploughman, L.4 
to L.5 5 herd-boy, L.l, 10s. to L.2 ; a female, L.l, 10s. to L.2 ; an 
able-bodied day-labourer in summer, from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. ; do. in 
winter, Is. or 2d. per hour; females for common work, 6d. per day. 

Formerly when the tenants sold their produce of oats almost 
entirely in meal, and rarely in grain, there were four mills in the 
parish; and the district thirled to each was called the siucam of 
that mill. The only one of these now existing is the mill of Con- 
nage, at Campbeltown. There was another at Culblair. The 
third was at Loddack or Tormujrain. The fourth was a salt water 
mill, which was double, or had two wheels. Its ruins still stand 
towards the entrance of the bay near the church. Across this bay 
a dike was erected, and the keeping in repair of so many feet of 
the dike was assigned to each tenant on the Earl of Moray's es- 
tate. A considerable supply of water for this mill was obtained 
from a burn which flows into the bay ; but the object of the dike 
was not merely to dam up the waters of this burn, but, first to 
exclude and then to admit the flow-tide at sluices so constructed, 
as that the mill might be turned both by the flow and the ebb- 
tide. This mill was given up about fifteen years ago. The follow- 
ing extract of minute of kirk-session shows that its erection was of 
an old date:— 17th Sept. 1682, " P. F. and M. English, millers 
of the salt water mill, charged by the officer for setting it, and 
grinding on the Lord's day." 

What is now the bog, was the old pond of the mill, which has 
been raised nearly to a level with the adjacent ground by the sand 
carried down by the burn, and the wreck driven in by the sea. 

Beans are not sown ; and pease and rye only occasionally, and 
to so small an extent as not to deserve notice. Tares are srown 
to a small extent. Bear or big is not now, and has not been in 
the memory of any now living, grown in this parish. Both Che- 
valier and common barley are sown. The Hopetoun and potato

trict are the late Angus. The Sandy oats now threatens to dis- 
place the Hopetoun and potato oats. The tenants find that the 
ground will not stand wheat at every rotation. 

It may be stated here, that, until the introduction of the system 
of large farms, and the modern system of agriculture, flax was uui- 
versally cultivated in this parish, for which it was even famed. The 
cheapness of cotton articles has had the effect of putting an end 
to the cultivation of flax. 

Lime has been in use at least since the large farms have been 
formed, and it may be said that turnips are never put down except 
with bone dust. At the season when thev are sown, it is sup- 
posed that common manure keeps our light" soils too open in the 
heat which then prevails ; at all events, the bones give the best 
produce. From 20 to 25 bolls of lime per acre is the rule followed. 
Second liming of a field does not seem to answer so well as was an- 
ticipated; and "subsoil ploughing and trenching seem not unlikely 
to become common on all the farms, before lime is laid on a se- 
cond time. 

The majority of the agricultural servants come from the interior 
Highlands. Native lads seem to prefer acquiring a trade when they 
have an opportunity. 

There has existed for upwards of fifty years, the Pettie and Ar- 
dersier Farmers' Society. Premiums are yearly awarded to those 
who are adjudged to be the best ploughmen at a public competi- 
tion. A prize has been added this year, to be given to the lad 
whose horses appear best groomed, and their harness best kept. 

The description of horses used in agriculture seems to be a cross 
between the Highland garron and the finest heavy horses from the 
south. They are both hardy and active, but not remarkably large. 
A pair of horses are considered sufficient for every fifty acres of 
a farm. They are" in some request for double harness. 

Fisheries.— There are two stake-nets on the property of the 
Earl of Moray, and one on the property of Culloden at Altirhe- 
Point. The erection of the former is of recent date, and it is said 
they have not as yet been found a very remunerating enterprise. 
The annual rent of all these salmon fishings is under L. 60. The 
Messrs Hogarth of Aberdeen rent the entire beach belonging to 
the Earl of Moray, and Mr R, Mackinnon, Altirlies Point, has'for 
many years possessed the fishing at that station, with other fishings 
in difl'erent places of the Highlands. 

There are 24 boats belonging to the iarish engaged in the 



PETTIE. 



403 



herring-fishiig. They are the property of four, we may say five, 
crews, or bands of eight men, who fish in company in one boat for 
haddocks, but who, in the herring-fishing, as they may happen, in- 
dividually, or conjointly, to possess a boat, break up, and hire as 
many as may give a crew of five hands and a boy to each boat. 
• Lads from the West Highlands are engaged for the her- 
ring-season at the rate of about L.4, They receive [in addi- 
tion, perhaps, a barrel of herrings. When they fish haddocks, 
eight men form the'crew. The fishers look to the herring-season 
as the great source of their income. Some of them almost despise 
the haddock-fishing as scarcely worth their pains. They are absent 
at the herring-fishing at Helmsdale, Wick, or Burghhead, about 
six weeks from the middle of July. 

It may safely be stated, that there is not along the coast of the 
Moray Frith, on either side, any colony of fishers more deserving 
of encouragement, and who receive less, than the fishers of Pettie 
They are like the order to M'hich they belong, very stationary in 
their knowledge, not a few of the parents being unable to read, 
and all of them too little disposed to keep their children either 
long or regularly at school. But they are almost to a man order- 
ly and irreproachable in their conduct, and of industrious habits. 
They are ready to enter the service of the farmers for the labours 
of the harvest, on their return from the herring-fishing; and from 
their residence in the vicinity, they render it practicable to some 
of the farmers to relieve themselves of the necessity of bringino- 
shearers from a .distance, and of finding them accommodation 
While they increase the advantages of the district by the supply 
offish, they purchase from the farmers what they require of meal, 
which, with fish, is their chief, we may say their only food. From 
there being no pier within a given distance of their dwelling, they 
are not entitled to certain aid, for the repair of their boats, which 
other fishers near a pier receive from the Fishing Board. A pier, 
to the erection of which the Fishery Board would contribute so 
largely, would be an advantage, not only to the fisher, but to the 
farmer, in the saving of strain to his horses in drawing coals and 
hme through a soft beach, without being obliged, as at present, 
to avail himself of moonlight or daylight to suit the state of the 
tides; and by facilitating the shipping of grain or wood. 

n-i leforehIs time, herrings were taken at Inverness. " Mag- 

.hVn ,ht ''''P'"' Percelebre." We can believe the fact sooner 

tnan the reason vulgarly assigned, which he gives for their forsaking that coast. We

Altirhes, which they now seek to the east of Fort- George. 



404 



INVERNESS-SHIIIE. 



On what principle Government aid for the repair of boats is 
only given to fishers within a certain distance of a pier, we know 
not; but it is obvious, that fishers who have to bring their boats 
ashore on an open beach, run the risk of greater injury to their 
boats than those who have the advantage of a pier. And a per- 
son ignorant of the reason of such a rule, as the writer confesses 
himself to be, would suppose that those who have a pier, and incur 
less tear and wear, should not be the parties to- receive any pecu- 
liar favour or aid. Those who have no pier are at the expense 
of two pounds more a year in ropes and anchors, by having " to 
liing at anchor" so often in deep water before they can bring their 
boats ashore. If we might judge from the public prints, it 
would seem to be no great national outlay to extend the Go- 
vernment aid to all fishers, wheresoever resident : " It appears 
that the total sum voted by Parliament during the last ten 
years amounted to L. 144,000, of which there has been paid for 
building or repairing ports or quays in Scotland, L. 27,666, or an 
average of L.2766 yearly ; for repairing the boats of fishermen in 
Scotland, L.4435, or an average of L.443 yearly; and for salaries 
and allowances of the officers, and incidental expenses of the esta- 
blishment, L.l 16,364, or a yearly average of L. 11,636." 

It is another disadvantage of which- the fishers of this coast 
complain, that, although their business be on the great waters, they 
are obliged to pay road-money on land. The fishers of Ross-shire 
are said to be relieved from this impost; and there are perhaps 
twenty fishers in Ross-shire for every one in Inverness-shire. 

The fishers both of Pettie and of Conuage were formerly in 
possession of crofts, by which one or more of a crew supported a 
horse. They were thus enabled, except when they had a large 
take of fish, to leave their boats at home, and, independent of the 
tide, to carry their fish to market, and to return home when they 
had sold their fish, without loitering till the next tide on the streets 
of Inverness, by which means they escaped many temptations to tip- 
pling. For some years they had been deprived of these crofts. But 
recently a crew has been removed from the estate, and crofts assign- 
ed to the rest of those in Pettie. If the possession of crofts should, 
as some think, make them less industrious in their calling as fishers, 
and enable them to carry to Inverness small takes of fish which they 
would, otherwise, sell in the parish, the moral benefit resulting to the 
men themselves should reconcile us to their possessing them. It were 
desirable that some plan or order were adopted, according to which 
their houses should be built and placed: for their straggling turf 



PETTIli:. 



405 



huts are hardly in keeping with the agricultural advancement of 
the district. It would be well, also, if their possession of crofts had 
been made dependent on their sending their children, female as 
well as male, to school, till able to read and write ; and that, as a 
precaution against pauperism, in case of disasters at sea, they 
should be required to contribute to the Shipwrecked Fishermen 
and Mariners' Benevolent Society. 

Oysters of an inferior description may be fished between Artirlie- 
Point and Avoch. The grandfather of the present proprietor of 
CuUoden had taken some pains to form and foster a bed, by pro- 
curing oysters from a distance, and placing them at the Point. 
More recently another bed has been formed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toton. — Inverness is the great market to which the po- 
pulation bring all their marketable commodities : the tenant, his 
well fed stotand grain ; the cottar's wife, her fowls, eggs, and dairy 
produce ; and the fisher, his nocturnal capture of cod, skate, 
whiting, haddock, flounder, sole, or herring. Since steamers 
have begun to ply regularly between London and Inverness, any un- 
commonly fine beast is sent to Smithfield. The coach-road from 
Aberdeen to Inverness, by which two stage-coaches and the mail 
daily leave and reach each place, runs through the entire length 
of the parish, making a bend so as to pass near Fort George 
through the village of Campbelton. Every obstacle to the forma- 
tion of a line of road higher up, keeping nearly the track of the old 
Nairn road, is now removed; and the making of it has been com- 
menced. This line will nearly bisect the parish along its entire 
. extent from east to west, will save about two miles in the distance 
between Nairn and Inverness, avoid a good deal of hill, and 
open up a better access towards Cawdor and Croy, At present 
there is, strange to say, not even a receiving-house for letters in 
the parish. To the advantage of the new line of road, that of a 
post-office will doubtless be added. The nearest post-offices are 
at Fort George, Ardersier, and Inverness. The only tryst held 
in the parish is the long established and much frequented Camp- 
belton market, held on the confines of Pettie and Ardersier, at 
Lammas. It is here that farmers from Morayshire and round In- 
verness engage their shearers; a good deal of business is done in 
the sale of lambs, cattle, horses, and small quantities of wool not 
worth being offered at the Inverness wool market.

Ecclesiastical Historij. — In the history of the Reformation from 
Popery, or of the struggles between Presbytery and Episcopacy, 
we find no mention of this parish, or of any names connected with 
it. Indeed, the changes of the national forms of religion seem to 
have extended to the North Highlands, with comparatively little 
excitement in the public mind, and without having led to much 
personal or domestic suffering. Hence we have no places render- 
ed interesting by a martyr's grave, nullnm saxum cum nomine. As 
to the north, generally, all that Wodrow can say is, " that the seed 
sown by Hog, Dickson, Bruce, and M'Killigan, took root in the soil, 
and that, though there were but few comparatively with the west 
and south, yet there were more than many imagine dissatisfied with 
Prelacy." This assertion derives confirmation from the diary of a 
religious lady called Lilias Dunbar of Torreich, a manuscript co- 
py of which is in the possession of Captain Shaw, Culblair, in this 
parish. By the year 1570, when the celebrated Robert Pont was 
visiter and the commissioner of Moray in the General Assembly, 
Shaw states that almost all the parishes in Moray had Protestant 
teachers. He gives the names of those in Pettie and Bracholy : 
Andro Braboner, 1568; James Dunbar, 1579. Of these we 
know nothing, and of Donald Macqueen, who served from 1613 
to 1630, the only notice we find is in this entry in the synod books ; 
Mr Macqueen " regrets that Mr P. Dunbar, minister of Dores his 
travels are unfruitful in the place where he serves, and that only 
through want of the language." From 1630 to 1633, there seems to 
have been no minister. For the synod appointed a " Committee 
to entreat my Lord of Moray to present some qualified man." From 
1633 till 1683, Alexander Fraser, father of Dr Fraser of Chelsea, 
was incumbent. We have a register of births during his whole in- 
cumbency ; but not of marriages. The session-records begin in 
1644; but the first few leaves of the volume were destroyed from 
its not having been bound till recently. The following extracts 
are given as illustrative of the times aqd of the character of the 
man.

Mr Eraser's long incumbency extended over the most troubled 
times of Scottish ecclesiastical history. Judging of his character 
by all that is known of him, we would regard him not as a mere 
temporizer, but as a man of a gentle and Catholic spirit, anxious 
to fulfil the ends of his ministry inhis own parish, and who, for 
the sake of peace, would approve of Leighton's " Modest De- 
fence of a Moderate Episcopacy." The synod records show 
that he incurred some censure during the period of Presbyterian 
ascendency ; but if he was considered by the Presbyterians as de- 
ficient in zeal in proceeding against Papists, compliers, f.nd malig- 
nants, he showed equal inaction in the times of Episcopacy, in 
compelling conformity by attendance at the Lord's table. The 

Lord's day in drunkenness and biding from church, were sharply reproved, and or- 
dained to stand at the pillar the next day, . . . under the pain of banishment.

and exhorted to crave of God mercy and grace to behave himself towards the said old

reasons : That God would move the King's heart to peace and unity witli Jiis sub-

session records bear sufficient evidence lhat he was not slothful 
as a parish minister. 

" No priest siiiinoly droning o'er his charge : 
But tlie best portion of the good man's life, 
His little, common, unrecorded acts 
Of kindness and of love." 

His son seems to have inherited the same liberality of sentiment, 
for, although resident the greater part of a long life in Eng- 
land, he left his fortune for the promotion of science and religion 
in the Presbyterian institutions and land of his fathers. 

Mr Fraser was succeeded by a Mr A. Denune, said to have been 
a native of the parish. Shaw says he was ordained privately. 
From the record of session, we could gather no confirmation of 
that statement. For 12th November 1682,' " Understand that 
from this day, Mr Alexander Denooii is helper till Whitsunday." 
In April Mr Fraser dies ; and it is often noticed in the record that 
certain things could not be done, as there was no actual minister. 

On 6th April 1684, Mr Eneas Macbsan of Inverness intimates, 
that Mr Denoon was to be institute. The minutes of the earlier 
part of his incumbency lead us to believe that tippling was in his 
time very prevalent in the parish. 

In L704, a process was commenced before the Presbytery 
against this incumbent, which ended in his deposition. A great part 
of the first volume of the Presbytery's records is taken up with the 
libel and evidence in this case. From some cause or other he 
was never ejected. In 1710, the Lord Advocate applies to the 
Presbytery for "a double of the process;" and it is likely that the 
civil law lent no aid; for in 1711, the Presbytery resolve to peti- 
tion the Lords of Justiciary, then sitting at Inverness, to eject 
him. In December 1708, the Presbytery appoint the ministers of 
Inverness to apply to the sheriff to declare the church vacant ; and 
in March 1709, "they report that the sheriff refuses to assist in 
that affair without a warrant from the Government, in regard that 
there was a riot in that place formerly, and that the people were 
ill set." It would seem that the people were on the side of the de- 
posed Episcopalian minister. In April 1712, Mr James C;alder 
says he did not supply at Peltie, because Mr Denoon's wife would

not give him the key of the kirk. In 1709, the Presbytery are 
rehevecl from their perplexity by Mr Denoon's death. 

Mr Denoon was succeeded by Mr Daniel Mackenzie, who was 
translated to Inverness in 1727. A Mr J. Duncanson, translated 
from Ardclach, succeeded Mr Mackenzie, and died in 1737. Mr 
Lewis Chapman, from Alvie, who died in 1741, was Duncanson's 
successor. 

Between the years 1704-39, the school of Pettie, taught by 
Mr John Clark, son-in-law of Mr Denoon, rose to high repute as 
a classical seminary, and sustained its character under subsequent 
teachers. The tradition is, that the farmers' sons in the parish 
understood Latin about as well as Gaelic. From the fame of the. 
teachers, gentlemen's children from great distances were board- 
ed in the parish. It was at this school that James Grant, late 
of Corrymony, author of " The Origin and Descent of the Gael," 
&amp;c. acquired the rudiments of his education; and General Fraser, 
and his brother Archibald, the sons of the Lord Lovat, who was 
beheaded, were among the pupils. 

On the death of Mr Chapman, Mr neas Shaw was translated 
to Pettie from Comrie in 1742,and was removed to Forres 1758. The 
tradition is, that at the time of the battle of Culloden, by giving 
certificates of character to the rebels of his neighbourhood, and 
asking no questions. for conscience sake, he saved the lives of a 
great many. It miiy serve to show with what wanton disregard of 
life the King's army conducted themselves at that time, that, in pas- 
sing the road, they seized this minister's servant and hung him on 
a tree, from which he was cut down, before life was extinct, by the 
minister himself. 

In 1759, a Mr John Morrison became minister of Pettie. We 
are ignorant of the place of his birth, and of his parentage. It 
appears that he was missionary at Amulree in April 1745, where he 
continued until translated to Pettie. There is to this day a prevalent 
belief m the North Highlands, that he was endowed with the 
gift of prophecy, and anecdotes in confirmation of this are related. 
He went by the name of the bard, and besides a song in praise of 
his patron, the Earl of Moray, beginning thus, 

" Deoch slainte an larla chluiteach ; 
Thug smuid dhuinn sa bhaile so," 

which means, " health to the famous Earl who has placed me by 
this hearth," the two following popular Gaelic songs are said to

be of his composition, and to have been written in praise of the lady 
whom he baptised, and who became his wife : 

1 Mo nighean dubh, tha boidheach dubli, 
Mo, &amp;c. 

2 Ho mo Mhari laodhach, 
Ho, &amp;c. 

A schoohnaster of the name of Allan was ejected at this period, 
after a tedious process before the Presbytery. His recriminations 
against Mr Morrison are of an amusing nature. 

From the year 1739, the time when Mr Clark had either died, 
or had ceased to act as session-clerk, till 1749, there are no session- 
records, nor baptismal registers. In 1765, there is a minute of ses- 
sion, complaining that previous session-clerks had taken away the 
records for not being paid their fees, " and no wonder then at the 
blanks to be found here." But from 1749, till the present day, 
there are regular baptismal and marriage registers. 

From 1774 till October 1833, Mr William Smith, a native of 
Rafford, who had acquired Gaelic, was minister of this parish. In 
■ strength of mind, ecclesiastical knowledge, and methodical habits, 
he had few equals. It is to be regretted that he did not publish, 
as he at one time intended, an edition of Shaw's History of Mo- 

• All that is related of him, indicates that he was a man of great sagacity, much 
humour, anS fervent piety. The manner in which he became the minister of Pettie, 
may be noticed as illustrative of the times. There was a merchant in Inverness to 
whom a follower of the I.ovat family in the Aird was deeply in debt. As no attorney 
in Inverness would undertake to recover the debt, the merchant employed a writer 
in Edinburgh, Mackenzie of Delvin, who was factor to the Earl of Moray and other 
proprietors in the north. Mr Mackenzie succeeded in forcing payment of the debt. 
The Frasers consulted how they might best .ivenge this audacious interference with 
the liberty of their clansman. As Mackenzie was in the habit of coming to the north 
at certain periods of the year, it was resolved to waylay him in Slocmuic on the first 
occasion ; and to put him to death. A Mr Nicolson, minister of Kiltarlity, was pre- 
sent at dinner when this scheme was concocted, in the house of the chief or some lead- 
ing clansman. To send a letter to Mackenzie by a bearer, or by post, would at that 
time scarcely have escaped discovery ; and, if ever discovered, would end in the rum 
of Mr N., as a traitor to his friends. The contrivance he fell upon was to write to 
Mr Morrison, to visit him on urgent business. Morrison accordingly came to the 
Aird, was informed by Mr Nicolson of the intentions of the Eraser's, and was dis- 
patched to Mackenzie of Delvin, to caution him never to come to the north with- 
out a strong escort of friends. On his next visit to the Highlands, a numerous body 
of tenantry was requested to met him at Dalwhinnie ; and the Frasers, finding him 
so protected, did not venture to make their attack. Mackenzie rewarded Mr Mor- 
rison for his service by procuring his appointment to the church of Pettie, on the 
removal of Mr Shaw to Forres.-f 

• We have been informed by a descendant of Mr Morrison's that Mackenzie was 

related to Mr Morrison. ' .,,.„•.. 

+ From the session records of Mr Morrison's time, we give the followmg extract : 
] 9th October 1772. It being complained, that, upon the llth, the tenants and 
herdsmen of Wester Dalyiel, gathered in a mob, and buckled together in such a tu-

ray, with additions and notes. From access to family documents 
and intercourse in early life with many whose oral narrations could 
furnish materials for interesting local history of the former half of 
the last century, and from the singular retentiveness of his memory, 
he was peculiarly qualified for this undertaking. A copy of Shaw's 
work, full of his marginal notes and corrections, which it is said 
had been borrowed for the assistance of agents in an important le- 
gal process, it has been found impossible to recover. 

The writer of the present account became assistant to Mr 
Smith in 1832, and his successor in 1834, It was during the lat- 
ter part of Mr Smith's time, that the change from small to large 
farms, and the introduction of lowland tenantry, took place. Till 
this change was effected, it was, only occasionally, necessary to preach 
in English. English has, for several years, been scarcely less ne- 
cessary than a Gaelic service, every Sabbath. 

The church is by no means conveniently situated for the 
greater part of the people, even of the parish of Pettie, The 
inhabitants of the parish of Bracholy are nearer to Ardersier, 
or Croy, or Cawdor, and, at the extreme east, to Nairn, than to 
their parish church. Hence comparatively few from Bracholy at- 
tend at all. Nearly the entire parish of Bracholy should be appor- 
tioned to Ardersier and Croy, as it virtually is quoad sacra, since all 
the people have ever been in the habit of attending in these 
churches. The church is about seven miles from the extreme 
eastern point, and not fully two from the western boundary, which 
is only four from Inverness. It contains 596 sittings. On ordi- 
nary occasions, a less number would suffice, as, both from the 
inconvenient situation of the church, and the existence of the two 
languages, the church-going population are only in part, and never 
at the same time in church. 

We give the several outlays upon the parochial buildings of 
this parish, as we find them noticed in the records of Presbytery 
from the beginning of the last century to the present day. In 
1720, on the manse, L.968, Is. 4d. Scots, and on the same, 
L. 1026, 2s. Scots in the year 1747. The church was built in 
1767, without any decreet of Presbytery, so that the expense is 
not mentioned. It could not have been great, for the west gable 
of the preceding church, part of which continues in the present 
church, was left standing, and the bare walls and roof with the 
pulpit were all that the heritors erected. The walls were never 
plastered nor the roof ceiled, and each farmer on the separate

properties paid for the pew which he occupied. The fishers 
erected one gallery and the session another, for which they took 
rent for a time, and which they ultimately sold. The tradition 
is, that it was for this church that the first ship laden with lime 
came to the beach ; and the point where the lime was landed ob- 
tained the name it bears. Rue an-aoil. In 1810, the church-yard 
and the garden were enclosed with a sunk fence, and repairs made 
on the church and manse, and the offices built, the cost of which 
amounted to L. 827 Sterling. In 1811, on repairs, L. 100. In 
1828, for the school-house, L. 200. We have not found the ex- 
pense of the preceding school-houses. Between 1836 and 1839, 
the chiu-ch, manse, and garden wall were rebuilt, and the offices 
repaired, which, including plans, &amp;c. cost L, 2022, 12s. A draw- 
back of L. 1 13 on glass and timber used in the church was ob- 
tained. It is due to the heritors to say, that all that was found 
requisite, they in the most prompt and liberal manner resolved to 
provide. The church is a model for a country church ; and the 
entire accommodations are sufficient and satisfactory in every re- 
spect. Some approximation may be made from this statement 
towards ascertaining how far the free teind in the heritors' hands 
has been consumed, or a tax on the rental occasioned by the cost 
of the parochial buildings, for the last century. 

The glebe of Pettie was enlarged by an excambion, so as to in- 
clude the equivalent for that of Bracholy. The arable glebe, ex- 
clusive of the garden, and of the declivity from the churchyard to 
the marsh, is upwards of twelve acres in extent. About six acres 
are made to differ from the unreclaimed sand only by the force of 
cultivation. The stipend is 15 chalders. When the stipend was 
modified on the 1st July 1829, there appeared a free teind of 
L.238, 15s. lid., out of which there was allocated 29 bolls, 2 fir- 
lots, 2| lippies meal, and same of barley. 

The population, with the exception of two Roman CathoHcs, 
and two families belonging to the Secession, are of the Establish- 
ed Church. The number of communicants in the parish is as fol- 
lows :— Males, 36; females, 45; in all, 81.

Education. — In 1838, the Society in Scotland for Propagating 
Christian Knowledge received on their scheme the school of Gol- 
lanfield, at the east end of the parish. The school accommodates 
a district of Croy, as the Society's school at CuUoden Inverness 
is available to the west end of this parish. The parish and other 
school in Ardersier and Croy are more convenient for some of 
the parishioners than are the schools within the parish ; and hence, 
of the children of this parish, there are, on an average yearly, at 
the parish school of Pettie about 50 ; Ardersier, 12 ; Croy, 40 ; 
Society school, Gollanfield, 55 ; Culloden, Inverness, 48. In 
Campbeltown, Forsyth's, 15 ; female reading school, Q ; 
Long's, 21 ; infant, 3; total, 250. In the Society's schools, Cul- 
loden and Gollanfield schools are kept on the Sabbath evening; and 
during the summer months, in the church, also, before ser\ce, a 
school is open to all who choose to attend ; but is chiefly designed 
for those in service, of whom there are many more in the parish 
unable to read than, for its credit, we should like to state in round 
numbers. We fear there are not few parents, who are indiffe- 
rent to the education of their male children, and consider it 
entirely superfluous for females. The above observation is by no 
means confined to the fishers ofour population. But we hope that 
such feelings and views are daily losing ground among the people. 

The want of a school for the instruction of females is much 
felt. Were the heritors to give a house and a small contribution 
for this purpose, they could hardly bestow a greater boon upon 
the people. It is lamentable to see poor girls under the necessity 
flf expending the earnings of one term, at a period of life when 
they become almost ashamed to confess their ignorance, in board- 
ing them.selves at Inverness, as long as they can during the next, 
in order to possess those common qualifications with which others 
more favourably situated begin service. Were the proprietors resi- 
dent, the female members of their families would consider such a

deficiency in the system of parochial instruction, a special reproach 
upon them, 

Literature.— About a yesiv ago, a parish hbrary was commen- 
ced ; not so much in order to meet the demand, as to create a 

taste for reading. 

Parochial Funds.— The poor on the roll are about 50. The 
proceeds of the mortcloth, the ordinary collections, and contingent 
contributions, are the only available funds, which are rarely divid- 
ed oftener than twice a year. In regard to the feelings of the 
poor in applying for parochial relief, there is found fully as nmch 
delicacy, on their part, in claiming relief, as there is promptness, 
in some quarters, to inquire whether they are in circumstances which 
render such an application necessary. In all such parishes as this, an 
allowance by the heritors equal to the parochial contributions 
would be sufficient for the maintenance of the poor. The contri- 
butions of the people would be proportioned to the necessities of 
the poor at the time ; the amount would be an index of the state 
of the poor ; and heritors would have the satisfaction of seeing 
that their tenants did not lay a greater burden on them than 
they were cheerfully bearing themselves. Every parishioner would 
have a motive to liberality by being conscious that every penny 
from him secured two to the poor. In consequence of the apathy 
towards the poor evinced by the heritors, some of the parishioners 
have begun to withhold their wonted church contributions, and 
others threaten to follow this example; all things seem tending 
to the speedy introduction of an assessment. 

Judying by all that we have been able to glean from natives of 
• the parish, the names of Earl of Moral/, and Forbes ofCulloden, 
seem ever to have been associated with all that is mild and pater- 
nal in landlords. " We had heard from our ancestors," said an 
old man, once, emphatically in Gaelic, « that Pettie was the envy 
of the tenant and of the poor, ach dh' fhalbh i biiilleach, that day 
is aone." Part of his regrets was to be traced to dissatisfaction 
with the agricultural changes which he had lived to witness. But, 
as there is no record, that, with the exception of L. 10 bestowed 
at the death of the late Earl of Moray, the poor have ever re- 
ceived, through the kirk-session, a single donation of meal, fuel, 
or money, from any heritor, we inquired how such a testimony 
■could be given, as to the happy condition of the poor ; and how 
thev could be said to be worse off now than in former times. The 
benevolence of these proprietors was evinced by their gratuitous 



PETTIE. 



415 



bestowal of crofts on decayed farmers, and allowances to indivi- 
duals considered to have some claim on their bounty ; so that there 
always were, and there now are, some select objects who are pen- 
sioners of this description. But although no class of men are 
more compassionate than the present occupiers of the large farms, 
it will be obvious at a glance, how the introduction of large farms, 
had brought the general poor, who had no claims to be received 
as pensioners, and who were reduced to subsist by alms, into a 
worse condition than they were in before. For, in a forenoon, and 
in the circuit of what now comprises only one or two large farms, 
they could obtain as many small cupfuls of meal, as they can now 
obtain after traversing a quarter of the parish. If the agricultural 
changes have spread an ampler board before a proprietor, it is, 
surely, not unreasonable to expect that some crumbs may be cast 
to the unpensioned and unbefriended of this class of paupers. 

This district, from its being traversed by the public road to 
Aberdeen, is peculiarly infested by impostors, pretending to be 
shipwrecked sailors, clerks, and schoolmasters whose health has 
failed, and vagrants with forged or out-dated passes, or begging 
certificates furnished with too much facility. We expect a remedy 
to this evil from the adoption of the Constabulary Act by the 
county, and the rural police now in course of formation. 

Fuel— Coal English chiefly is the fuel of the farmers. On 
Gollanfield and CuUoden properties, peats are a good deal used. 
The poorest classes avail themselves of any brushwood which they 
can find. 

Jle-hoiises.— There are two licensed dram-houses on the old 
Nairn road, and two in the village of Stuartown. There were 
twelve such houses when the former Account was written. 

Savinffs Banks.— It is not improbable that, before the present 
Account passes through the press, a savings bank may be esta- 
blished in the parish.  

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Account was published, extraordi- 
nary changes have taken place in this parish. Large tracks, 
which " nature then held in her own hands,"and which were cloth- 
ed only with broom or whins, are now enclosed and subdivided as 
fertile fields. The clumps of trees which marked the frequent 

tri'ct°" ''''''''•'l ' Inverness, and is available to he surrounding dis.

INVEIINESS-SHIRE. 



farm-house, have long since yielded to the axe, and one farm em- 
braces what was of old three, four, or eight small farms. 

The former Account states, " A few of the occupiers of th e 
larger farms have adopted the modes of cultivation introdu- 
ced into the more improved parts of the country. But the whole 
of the ordinary tenantry still retain the same practices that were 
followed by their predecessors. Barley is sown with manure, and 
oats without it, so long as the land will produce more than the seed 
sown in it ; after which it is allowed to rest three years as lea, and 
then it is broke up to undergo the same treatment. From improper 
management the land does not produce so much grain as it other- 
wise might." It may now be said that in no district is a superior style 
of farming to be witnessed. The six-shift rotation has been fol- 
lowed, but the tenants are already returning to the five. The 
smallest farmer endeavours to emulate the most spirited of his 
neighbours. As soon as any improvement in agriculture has fairly 
been ascertained in other places, it is found to be adopted by the 
enterprising tenants of the large farms ; so that the system of hus- 
bandry is of the most approved description. From the lightness 
of the soil, it not unfrequently happens that much loss is sustain- 
ed at the sowing of the turnip crop by strong westerly winds. 
We have, oftener than once, seen acres of flourishing young tur- 
nip braird, shrivelled and wafted away, both root and leaf, in the 
course of one hour, by one of these gales occurring after a few 
scorching days. This very year, a stone dike, about four feet 
hiffh, saved a field on the Brae side, for an extent of one hundred 
yards from it. From the clouds of dust rising from the recently 
sown turnip fields, a stranger could scarcely imagine how vegeta- 
tion makes any progress in so arid a soil, until he observes the 
great counteraction to the want of humidity in the ground, which 
is derived from the exceedingly heavy dews, which are the effect 
of the porousness of the soil. Before the moss was sufficiently 
drained, the potatoes used to suffer in the beginning of autumn, 
on some farms, from a mildew, which advanced along an invaria- 
ble course, and blighted the potatoes, but without affecting any 
other crop. This now happens more rarely than in former years. 
The interruption of trees would furnish, if not an entire, yet a con- 
siderable preservative from the damage occasioned by this mildew, 
as well as by the wind. If beltings of trees between the several 
farms, or even single rows between the fields, were planted, the 
influence of these in dry summers would more than countervail the 



LAGGAN. 



417 



damage which some farmers lay to the account of trees, — while they 
would exceedingly beautify the aspect of the parish. 

As respects horticulture, this parish can advance no claims equal to 
some others, with a less favourable chmate. Some of the cottages 
have a pleasing patch of garden attached to them, and in these we 
generally find one or more hives of bees, which seem to thrive in 
this district. Each of the large farms has its garden, and the best 
farmer is not always the worst gardener. But, except at Fleming- 
ton, 'reetown, and Culblair, no garden engages the entire labour 
of a gardener. The fine garden of CuUoden House is in Inver- 
ness parish. Were the parish so wooded as to afford protection 
from the north and east winds, the soil and climate would encou- 
rage more attention to horticulture, even with the disadvantage of 
having no resident proprietors to set an example. 

In conclusion, we cannot but anticipate, that with landlords and 
tenantry, such as, in the main, the parish can boast of, its agri- 
cultural management will continue to bear comparison with that 
of any other parish in similar circumstances ; that, with the remo- 
val of those economic disadvantages, to which truth required that 
we should allude, the farmer, fisher, and pauper will have little to 
envy, when he contrasts his own condition with that of his com- 
peers anywhere else.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERTARFF, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. DONALD CAMERON, MINISTER 

I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries, avd Extent. — The name is supposed to be 
derived from the Gaelic word lag, signifying a small round hollow 
plam or dimple. Laggain or Laggun is the plural of the word 
T,ag ; Laggan is also the diminutive of the same term. 

The extent of this parish from north to south, and from east 
to west, is about 22 English miles in each direction. It is 
bounded on the north, by Boleskine ; on the cast, by Kingussie ; 



418 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



on the west, by Kilmanivaig ; on the south, by parts of the pa- 
rishes of Fortingal and Blair Athole. Its form is so irreo-ular 
that a description of it would be unintelligible. 

Topographical Appearances. — A stranger entering the parish 
from the south or east, would be apt to conclude that he is ap- 
proaching a wild region of barren and heath-covered mountains, 
unfitted by nature for the habitation of man. The eye sees no- 
thing, but 

" Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps o'er Alps arise." 

The aspect of the country appears so dreary and gloomy, that 
he is ready to imagine he has left behind him every spot in 
which the wit and industry of man can be exercised to any bene- 
ficial purpose ; and, judging from the prospect before him, he 
could hardly conceive how fields to any extent could exist in a 
locality where the mountains are crowded together, and seem to 
have been thrown on the tops of each other for the want of room. 
But, arriving at certain places, where a proper view of the coun- 
try is obtained, this delusion is vanished. Instead of the barren- 
ness and desolation which he anticipated, he is astonished at find- 
ing himself introduced, at once and on a sudden, into a beautiful 
level country, having a much greater resemblance to the fertile 
fields of the lowlands, than what could be supposed to exist in 
the bosoms of so many hills. The hills, at the same time, seem 
as if they had modestly retired, and to have taken up their position 
at a respectful distance on the back-ground ; and a scene, as sweet 
and picturesque as it is unexpected and enchanting, opens to the view. 
Amongst the first objects that meet the eye, is the Vale of Spey, ex- 
tending to the west upwards of twenty miles in length, and about two 
in breadth. In the foreground is Cluny Castle, the residence of 
Cluny Macpherson, surrounded with thriving plantations of fir and 
larch, and other symptoms of improvement. In the back-ground, to 
the north, stands the Monadlia, gray mountain, a prodigious ridge 
that rises on the confines of Lochaber, continuing its eastern 
course for upwards of eighty miles, until it terminates in the vici- 
nity of Nairn. This pile rises about 3000 feet above the level of 
the sea; in some parts, it is thirty miles broad, and divides the Vale 
of the Spey on the south from the Basin of Lochness on the 
north side. The hills of Drummond are seen in the distance to 
the west. These divide the Vale of Spey from that of Lochlag- 
gan. To the south of Lochlaggan is the Benalder range, the 
favourite haunt of the red-deer or mountain stag, before sheep

were introduced to invade its territories. This range is as lofty 
as the Monadlia, and far more picturesque in appearance. 
The scenery around and in the vicinity of Lochlaggan, is real- 
ly splendid. To the traveller, in approaching it, the view is 
very imposing. The hills to the south of the lake rise in sharp 
precipitous peaks, one above another, as if they had been torn 
asunder and thrown into their present position by some violent 
convulsion of nature. To the spectator, as he moves along, they 
seem to change their general outline, and also their relative posi- 
tion, like a moving panorama, every five minutes, and thus present 
a succession of landscapes always pleasing. 

Hydrography. — We have thousands of springs among the hills 
and also in the valleys, but none of them claiming any particular 
notice. The principal river is the Spey. It rises in a small lake 
of the same name in the western part of the parish, and follows 
an easterly course, until it enters the parish of Kingussie, below 
Loch Uvie. The Pataig is a small stream that runs westward to 
Lochlaggan. We have several other smaller ones, such as the 
burns of Markie, of Gorgask, of Cluny, of Meshie, of Breakachy, 
and the Bronach. The whole of these in dry weather are very 
low, but a few hours of heavy rain swell them at times into roar- 
ing and destructive torrents. One occurrence to which we shall 
advert shews the violence and impetuosity which these mountain 
streams are, at times, capable of assuming. On the 2Qd of May 
1831, a memorable day in Laggan, a dark cloud was seen sailing 
slowly from the north across the Monadlia. About three o'clock' 
in the afternoon, it burst over the centre of the parish, discharging 
in the most terrific manner, a storm of thunder, lightning, and rain. 
The thunder and lightning were such, that a gentleman who resid- 
ed eighteen years in Jamaica declared, he never witnessed, even 
there, such a war of the elements. The rain fell on the hills, in 
such profusion, as to give them the appearance of being shrouded 
in tinfoil. Every burn and streamlet within the range of the cloud 
swelled in an instant, carrying banks, stones, and everything be- 
fore them. At Sherrobeg, a small stream almost dry in summer, 
came down with such violence, that, " at one fell swoop," it car- 
ried away a bridge of stone and lime that had stood there, since 
the days of General Wade. The burn of Bronnoch, which passes 
within a few yards of the clergyman's house, contains in summer 
hardly any water: on this occasion, it beat against the walls of the 
house, and, entering, covered in a moment the ground floor of all 



INVEUNESS-SHIRi:. 



tlie rooms with water two feet deep, occasioning no small damage 
to the furniture. The family were obliged to make a hasty retreat, 
and to seek shelter in the neighbourhood, during the night. 

Lakes. — In this parish, there are several lakes of various sizes. 
Lochericht is the principal one. It is supposed to be upwards of 
twenty miles in length, and somewhat less than two miles in breadth. 
Its north end is near Dalwhinnie ; its southern extremity termi- 
nates in the braes of Rannoch, and forms one of the reservoirs of 
the river Tay. This splendid sheet of water runs in a straight 
line in a southern direction from Dalwhinnie ; and in its course 
divides the ancient forest of Drimachtor on the east, from that of 
Benalder on the west side. About one-third of this lake belongrs 
to, and lies within the territory of the parish of Fortingal, as it 
leaves the boundaries of this parish before it has run above two- 
thirds of its course to its southern termination. In the autumn of 
1746, the Pretender spent two weeks in a place of concealment 
near the banks of Lochericht. Here, he had the pleasure of 
meeting Lochiel and Cluny, and other companions in tribulation, 
who took shelter in this sequestered place, after their defeat at 
Culloden. At the side of Lochericht, the Prince enjoyed an asy- 
lum as inaccessible to the Duke of Cumberland's troops, as the 
tracks of the Highlanders were to his troops. Here he recruited 
his strength and spirits ; and it was from this spot, that he set 
out to embark in the ship that conveyed him to France. 

Next to Lochericht is Lochlaggan. It is reckoned eight miles 
long, and about one broad. All the lakes are stored with fish. To 
Lochlaggan, the best spawning ground perhaps in existence, the 
salmon has no access. The sum of about L.50 in all probability 
would remove the only obstacle — a rock in the river Spean, about 
eight miles from the west end of the lake. It is reported that the 
Marquess of Abercorn, who has a shooting lodge on the banks of 
Lochlaggan, Cluny Macpherson, and other gentlemen, are about 
to get this obstacle removed. 

Soil and Climate. — The soil in the lower valleys is alluvial, 
and is in some places from ten to twelve feet deep. In favourable 
seasons, it yields splendid crops of oats, bear, potatoes, sown and 
natural grasses. Towards the end of July, these have a most lux- 
uriant appearance. But the climate, although generally healthy, 
is any thing but favourable to agriculture. Frost, snow, and rain 
during winter and spring, retard the labours of the field ; sowing, 



LAGGAN. 



421 



therefore, is unavoidably late ; and the grain is late in ripening. 
Frost in Angust and September frequently occurs, and destroys 
the potatoes and corn crops. This was the case in the last three 
years, not merely in Laggan, but through the whole of Badenoch. 
The writer has heard people say that they remembered years, when 
a chalder of oats would not in the mill yield a boll of meal, from 
the ravages of frosts and mildews. 

Geology. — This subject, as far as we know, has never been 
fullv investigated in reference to this parish. The chief rocks be- 
long to the gneiss formation, of which many interesting varieties 
are met with. We have an excellent bed of limestone that runs 
through the centre of the parish. Slate of inferior quality is also 
found ; but since the Parliamentary road was opened to Fort- Wil- 
liam, this kind of slate is seldom used, — BallachuUish slate being 
reckoned far superior to it. 

Zoology. — Salmon, sometimes in summer, and always in the 
season of spawning, come up even as far as Loch Spey. There 
are some fine small trouts in the rivulets and burns. But the vo- 
racious pikes, which are very plentiful in the deep pools of the 
river Spey, and the no less voracious otter, which is everywhere, 
are destructive foes to all kind of fish. Black-cock, grouse, and 
partridges, and hares, are plentiful on the moors and low grounds. 
Ptarmigan are found on the tops of the high hills. We have 
been sometimes visited with wild swans and geese. Wild ducks 
are abundant. The summer always brings the swallow and the 
cuckoo. The mountain-deer and timid roe are found in the se- 
questered glens. Besides these and some others, we have foxes, 
polecats, wild cats, weasels, ravens, hawks, owls, and eagles, not- 
withstanding that, for many years, fox-hunters, gamekeepers, and 
shepherds, have waged a war of extermination against the whole 
tribe. 

Wood. — The natural wood is birch, alder, hazel, willow : the 
planted, Scotch fir, birch, — with some other hard-wood, of late 
years, planted around Cluny Castle. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners. — We have four heritors in the parish, namely, 
James Evan Baillie, Esq. of Kingussie ; Ewen Macpherson, Esq. 
of Cluny Macpherson ; Major Macpherson of Glentruim ; and 
John Walker, Esq. of Crawfordtown and Lochtreig. Mr Baillie 
is the principal heritor. Cluny Macpherson resides in the parish, 



422 



INVERNESS-SMIRE. 



and Glentruim is purposing to do the same, having lately built 
a mansion-house upon his estate. 

The Duke of Gordon was proprietor, nearly of two-thirds of 
this parish, till within the last ten years. Cluny bought a part of 
it, contiguous to his property. Much about the same time, Glen- 
truim bought another part, for which he paid nearly L.20,000. 
In the year 1834, Mr Baillie purchased the rest of it. 

Eminent Characters. — The late Mrs Grant, who was married to 
the Rev. James Grant, formerly minister of this parish, and was 
favourably known to the public as the authoress of several popular 
publications,— was the daughter of Mr Macvicar, an officer in 
the British army. She was born in Glasgow in the year 1755, 
and descended by her mother's side from the Stewarts of Inver- 
nahyle, in Argyllshire. When an infant, she and her mother 
followed her father to America, whither he went along with his 
regiment. When four years of age, her mother taught her to 
read. A sergeant in a Scottish regiment gave her the only lessons 
in penmanship she ever received. About the year 1768, her father 
came to Scotland, and was appointed barrack-master at Fort- 
Augustus ; the office of chaplain to the fort being then filled by the 
Rev. James Grant, a gentleman of accomplished mind and man- 
ners. In the year 1775, Mr Grant was settled as minister of the 
parish of Laggan ; and in 1779, was united in marriage to Miss 
Macvicar. Mr Grant died in December 1801, and Mrs Grant left 
Laggan in 1803, and went to reside in the neighbourhood of Stir- 
ling. She had twelve children, four of whom, in infancy or early 
life, predeceased their parents ; eight of them survived their father. 
The youngest, a writer to the Signet in Edinburgh, survives his 
mother, who died at Edinburgh on the 7th November 1838, in 
the 84th year of her age. 

 Mrs Grant's works are the following i — 

1. " The Highlanders," and other poems on various subjects. In one volume, 
published in London in 1803. 

2. " Letters from the Mountains," being a series of correspondence, addressed by 
Mrs Grant, when resident at Fort-Augustus and Laggan, to her friends in the south- 
ern parts of the kingdom. In three volumes, published in London in 1806. The 
friends to whom the letters were chiefly addressed, were Miss Isabella Reid, now 
Mrs Smith of Jordanhill; Miss Dunbar of Boath; Mrs Brown of Glasgow, and 
others. 

3. Memoirs of an American Lady," being an account of the author's residence 
in very early life in North America, before the American Revolution, containing 
descriptive sketches of Colonial Society and manners in these primitive times, and par- 
ticularly of a lady of distinguished birth, and character, and accomplishments, who 
then resided in the province of New York, In two volumes, published in London in 
1810.

li. may be mentioned as an interesting circumstance, that Mrs' 
Grant was among- the last surviving individuals, who met with the 
celebrated Dr Samuel Johnson, while upon his memorable Tour 
in Scotland in 1773. Mrs Grant, then a girl of eighteen, resided 
at Fort-Augustus, when Dr Johnson spent part of a day in visiting 
and inspecting the fort. She has been heard to describe the strong 
impression made upon her memory by the ponderous figure, and 
peculiar costume, of the great moralist and lexicographer. 

This lady, who resided twenty-four years in this parish, posses- 
sed talents of a very high order, sanctified by sincere, fervent, un- 
obtrusive piety, producing an enlarged benevolence to her fellow- 
creatures. 

Parochial Registers. — The first entry of baptism in our register 
is dated 1775; and the first of marriage, five years later. The 
register has not been always very regularly kept : and the burials 
have not been recorded. 

HistoricalNutices. — There is a tradition that, in ancient times, 
the Kings of Scotland were often wont to come, upon hunting excur- 
sions, to the side of Lochlaggan, and that one, if not more, of the 
Kings Fergus was buried there. The place is still called Jrdveirge, 
or the Aird height of Fergus. About three years ago, the Mar- 
quess of Abercorn commenced building a shooting-lodge there. 
A piece of ground was trenched for a garden, in the immediate 
vicinity of the grave, and a silver coin about the size of a sixpence 
was found by the trenchers. This coin is of a very ancient date, 
— Henry II. There are two small islands in Lochlaggan, nearly 
abreast of Ardveirge, which are termed Eilean an Righ King's 
Island, and Eileannan Con Dog's Island. It is supposed that, 
in the last-mentioned place, the dogs were tied or secured after 
the chase. 

When the Rebellion of 1745 broke out, the dilatory function- 
aries of Government sent Sir John Cope, with about 1400 men, to 
check the career of the Pretender, and to scatter his daring follow- 
ers. Sir John accordingly set off" upon his expedition, and appeared 
to be so observant of the punctilios of military etiquette in his move- 
ments, that if the Highlanders had been led by Montrose or Dundee,

instead of the Prince, they might have been half-way to London be- 
fore he had crossed Drimachtor. The Enghsh general, with his men 
on their journey northward, encamped one night near Dalwhinnie, 
within this parish. On the same night, the Prince, without any ap- 
prehension of an unceremonious visit from the Lord Advocate, 
was on the north side of Carry-yarrac. It is reported, that Sir John 
was very far from putting confidence in the prowess of his troops : 
and. at day-break the following morning, he took a very simple 
method to try the firmness of their nerves. Pointing to a clump 
of wood about two miles distant, he exclaimed, " yonder are the 
Highlanders." The result evinced that his companions in arms 
were, by no means, in a fighting humour ; for it is said, that the 
whole seemed to tremble from head to foot. A council of war was 
then held by the officers. It was there judged that the better part 
of valour was discretion, and, with the exception of one, they re- 
solved to let the Prince alone, and to march to Inverness. Much 
ridicule has been cast upon the hapless general, for this measure. 
But, most assuredly, had he gone to meet his opponent, the na- 
ture of the ground is such, that, in all probability, every individual 
would have been killed or taken prisoner. Sir John's advanced 
guard marched as far as Blargybeg, on the south side of the Spey, 
nearly opposite to the church of Laggan, and then directed their 
course to Inverness. This was soon made known to the High- 
landers ; for a deserter from Cope's army fled to the Prince, and 
told him what had happened. It was then suggested that the 
Prince and his followers should march along the Monadlia, and 

 For some time after the Rebellion, the governmeTit was very vigilant "in dis- 
covering, and vindictive in punishing every symptom of attachment to the exiled fami- 
ly ; and numberless were the instances of ferocious and brutal vengeance exercised, 
often upon very slight grounds, against the faithful but deluded Jacobites. The Jaco- 
bites, on the other hand, were only exasperated by these proceedings ; and were led to 
adopt ingenious devices to display their principles, without becoming entangled In the 
meshes of the law. We hope to be pardoned for relating the following anecdote : Mr 
Oliphant of Gask was a staunch adherent to the Stuarts ; and regularly every even- 
ing, drank the healths of King James, Prince Charles, and Duke Henry, after din- 
ner, whoever happened to be present. One evening the Lord Juslice-Clerk li.nppened 
to be a guest at his table, and as Mr Oliphant's principles and practices were not 
a secret, his Lordship had no small degree of curiosity to see how his worthy host 
would comport himself, so as to manifest his loyal feelings towards his King tic jure, 
without committing treason in such dangerous company, against his sovereign dc 
facto. He was not kept long in susjiense upon the subject, for after dinner, the first 
health proposed, was the King James, — nodding to his eldest son; next, Prince 
Charles, nodding to his second son ; lastly, the Duke Henry, nodding to his third son. 
This ingenious ceremony being gone through with the utmost gravity, to the great 
amusement of the amiable judge, who found that the laird was a match for the lawyer, 
his Lordship, addressing his worthy host in a good-natured manner, said, " Well, my 
friend, you sail as near the wind as any man I ever met with."

wait Cope's arrival at Slochdmuichd, a narrow pass within twentv- 
three miles of Inverness. Had this sagacious advice been followed, 
Sir John and his men would probably have fared even worse than 
they afterwards did at Prestonpans. Charles and his followers 
marched, however, through the parish without obstruction. Cluny 
Macpherson was then Captain in the King's army. His company 
was then stationed at Ruthven Castle, about ten miles down the 
Spey; and the laird happened to be at his own Castle at the time. 
This being made known to the Prince, it was proposed that a 
detachment should be sent to seize the Rebel Cluny, as the Prince 
was pleased to call him. The order was given ; and Lochiel was 
commissioned to see it executed. That chieftain, no doubt, thought 
it a hazardous enterprise to attempt making prisoner of a chief- 
tain in his own castle, in the midst of his own clan, and preferred 
to send a detachment consisting of one man, who surprised Cluny," 
and brought him prisoner to the Prince. The Prince was of so 
forgiving a disposition, that he was graciously pleased to pardon all 
his past treasons, on condition of his leaving the service of the 
Usurper, and joining his own standard. The chief, it is said, 
acquiesced. Afterwards, however, Cluny accompanied Charles 
to Edinburgh, was present with his regiment at the battle of 
Prestonpans,— followed him to England,— had the rear-guard in 
the skirmish at Clifton or Penrith : and with about 600 Mac- 
phersons, put two regiments of the Duke of Cumberland's dra- 
goons to flight. Had he and his gallant followers been present 
at Culloden, it is more than probable that the fate of the day 
would be different from what it was. After Culloden, he was 
the object of the Duke of Cumberland's special vengeance. But, 
m spite of all that he and his spies could do, the chief continu'- 
ed to set their vigilance at defiance, and to conceal himself for. 
nine years in Laggan. He had, however, many narrow escapes, 
in which he evinced much adroitness and presence of mind. On 
one occasion, when residing at a gentleman's house in this parish, a 
party of soldiers was seen approaching the house. Escape was 
impossible ; but, having quickly equipped himself in the habiliments 
of one of the Gillies in the house, with hands and face half-black- 
ened for the occasion, and with head and legs quite bare, he went 
out to meet his pursuers. The officer gave him his horse to keep, 
while he and his party conducted the search for the obnoxious 
chief Within the house, and rewarded him with half a crown for 
his pains, after the search was over. Cluny at last escaped to

France, where he died. His estate was forfeited ; but it was re- 
stored along with the other forfeited estates. 

Antiquities. — " In the middle of the parish, there is a rock 
which is upwards of 100 yards perpendicular, and very difficult of 
access ; yet on the very summit, there are considerable remains of 
a fortification. The wall is built, outside and inside, with large 
flags or broad stones, without mortar. It is upwards of three yards 
in thickness. The area will measure 500 feet in bngth, and 250 in 
breadth." Former Account. We believe that this rock is at 
least 600 feet above the level of the adjoining valley. At the east 
end of Loch Laggan, the ruins of the old church are to be seen. 
The walls are still standing, but the roof is gone. Some suppose 
it to have been dedicated to St Kenneth, others to St Killen. 

• There is an amusing tradition connected with the building of this church, and 
which we shall give here, as it may afFord some idea of the ignorance, superstition, 
and the barbarity of the times to which it refers. It is said that this church was 
built by " Allan nan Creagh," or Allan of the spoils, a soubriquet given to one of 
the family of Lochiel. The following anecdote has been gravely told, and gravely 
believed by the good people of Lochaber and Badenoch, as giving an account of the 
circumstances that led to the building of this and of six other churches. It is said 
that Allan was very active, and at first rather successful in levying contributions from 
his neighbours, and in driving off their cattle without ceremony, for his own special 
use. But the tide of plunder does not always run smooth, any more than that of love. 
Allan, having met with some disasters in his predatory expeditions, was resolved upon 
having some communication with the inhabitants of the invisible world, in order to 
find out the cause. There was a celebrated witch in his neighbourhood, called Gorm 
Shuil, or blue-eyed. She was such an adept in her profession, that she could trans- 
form herself and others into hares, and crows, raise hurricanes from any quarter of 
the compass she pleased, and perform other wonderful exploits, too tedious to men- 
tion. Under the direction of this and other similar advisers, Allan, to attain the ob- 
ject he had in view, took a living cat, and with his servant, went at night to a corn- 
kiln, near Torcastle, in Strathlochy. The cat was put living on a spit ; and the ser- 
vant commenced the process of roasting it before a slow fire, while Allan stood at the 
entrance leadmg to the fire, with a drawn sword, to keep off all intruders. The cat 
set up doleful lamentations, when a crowd of cats immediately gathered, as it were, to 

its rescue; but they were kept at a respectful distance, by the redoubtable Allan. 

Every cat as it came exclaimed in Gaelic " Sole an carabh cait sin," that is " bad 
treatment of a cat." " It will not be better just now," was Allan's response; and 
every moment he would address the man at the fire, saying, " whatever you may 
hear or see, keep turning the cat." At last, a black cat with one eye came, and 
calmly remonstrated with the guardian of the passage, on his cruelty,— and told hmi 
that his late reverses were a punishment for his wickedness, in plundering his neigh- 
hours; and that, in order to atone for his guilt, and obtain forgiveness for his sins, 
• he must build seven churches,— a church for every creagh that he raised. _ The cat 
' Camdubh the one-eyed cat, added, that if Allan would persevere in his present 
amusement, until the cat with the long hanging ears, his brother, Cluosa kabhra 
mo bhrathair, should arrive, he would take such summai-y vengeance, that Allan 
would never see his Maker's face in mercy. This lecture having struck terror info 
Allan's soul, he released the cat at the fire ; and did not wait the arrival of the dread, 
ful Cluasan leabhra, but retired immediately from the scene, and lost notimeincom- 
■ mencing his church building scheme, according to the directions of his monitor,— 
he erected, ere he died, the seven churches, which are still pointed out : and it is said, 
that the old church of Laggan was one of the seven. • . i 

In St Mungo's Island, at the entrance of loch Leven, near Glenco, in Argyle- 
shire there is a burial-place; and there we find another of Allan nan Creagh s

quess of Abercorn, on the margin of Loch Laggan, at Ardveirge, 
on Cluny property. The scale on which this lodge is erected, may 
be inferred from the fact, that it is taxed for sixty windows. It is 
erected on a fine romantic spot. Mr Baillie of Kingussie and 
Glenelg has built another, though not on so large a plan, at Glen- 
shirra, on the margin of another lake. 

III. — Population. 

At the date of the former Statistical Account, the number of 
people in this parish was 1512. At the census of 1831, it had 
decreased to 1196. This decrease may be accounted for by 
the introduction of sheep, and throwing several small farms into 
sheep-walks. Many of the inhabitants have emigrated into Ame- 
rica ; and many more are preparing to go to Australia. In some 
parts of the parish, where, about eighty years ago, there was a 
dense population, there are to be found now only a few scattered 
shepherds' huts. 

Language.— The language of the people is Gaelic; but many 
understand English, which is always spoken by the better sort of 
people. The English is gradually gaining ground. The people 
are most anxious to acquire a knowledge of it. 

Games and Amusements.— There is one amusement, to which we 
are called on to allude. It is called camac, or shinty matches. It 
is conducted as follows : A gentleman announces that he is to give a 
shinty play, on a certain day, in a certain place. The meaning of 
this announcement is that a certain quantity of whisky is to be dis- 
tributed, at the place, to the players and spectators. The quantity 

churches. The following story is reported, and firmly believed at this day in that 
part of the country : About the middle of the last century, a man was buried in the 
island. For several mghts after, the dead man disturbed the whole neighbour, 
hood in Glenco, calling m a most dolorous strain, on a certain individual, to come 
and to relieve him The man at last set off for the island, in the dead hour of night, 
and having arrived at the grave, found the dead man with his head and neck fairly 
above the ground : " What is your business with me," says the Glenco man, « and why 
hfn"" ['/f "'■''"S neighbourhood with your untimely lamentations after this fa- 
TTL .7-" I 'a 'f','"' "'-est night or day since I lay here, nor shall 

I as long as this head is on my body ; 1 shall give you the reason. In my younger 

wm llrT T' '°\™"ly' that I would marry a certain woman, and that I never 
would forsake her, as long as this head remained on my body. At this time I had a 
hold of a button, and the moment we parted, I separated the head of the button from 
the neck, thinkmg that then all was right. I now find my mistake. You must, 
t erefore, cut off my head." The other, fetching a stroke, cut off the head close to 
ine surtace of the ground ; and then the dead man dragged the rest of the body back 
to the grave, leaving the head to shift for itself This story is as firmly believed ill 
t-ienco this day, by some people, as any truth of holy writ.

of whisky provided on these occasions varies, according to the 
wealth, the Uberahty, or the vanity of the donors, from four to 
ten, or perhaps fourteen imperial gallons. Hundreds of people, 
old and young, gather together on those occasions, and the scene 
is closed, in many instances, by drunkenness, fighting, and blood- 
shed. This practice is most injurious to the morals of the people, 
and ought certainly to be discontinued by the gentry. 

Character of the People, c. — The people are strong, healthy, 
active, and hardy. They are remarkably shrewd, intelligent, af- 
fable, and polite. With very few exceptions, they are regular in 
attendance on the ordinances of religion. There are some, how- 
ever, to whom the opposite description would be more applicable : 
they show a cunning, quarrelsome, and crafty disposition. But, 
considering the disadvantages under which the people labour — 
their temptations — the countenance which they receive in their 
folly from some of their influential superiors — the negligence, 
apathy, and want of activity on the part of the conservators of the 
peace, the wonder is, not that any exceptionable characters are 
found amongst us, but that they are not more numerous. Under 
proper encouragement, and especially under a judicious system of 
pohce, we are firmly of opinion, that the population of this country- 
would form as regular, as orderly, and as industrious a peasantry 
as any in the kingdom. 

The dress of the common people is made, for the inost part, of 
home-made cloth of various colours. Young gentlemen, and 
such of the common people as feel disposed to ape their betters, 
wear the philabeg, with the other paraphernalia of the " garb of 
old Gaul." 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture— The number of acres in cultivation cannot be as- 
certained. By capital and industry, much land could be brought 
into tillage. But it is doubtful whether the returns would repay 
the outlay ; and good judges consider such land to be more pro- 
fitably laid out in pasture for sheep. Tenants at will, or with short 
leases of from five to nine years, have no inducement to improve 
the soil by draining, trenching, and liming. If we connect with 
these disadvantages the blasting operations of the frost in harvest, 
the agriculturist has little encouragement to cultivate the soil ac- 
cording to any approved system of husbandry. 

jRewf.— Rents are determined by the number of sheep any place 
is supposed to pasture. It is reckoned that 2s. a-year for a sheep 



LAGGAN. 



429 



is full rent, and if the wool does not pay the rent, that the farm is 
too high set. Cows are pastured at from L. 2 to L. 3 during sum- 
mer. The rental of the whole parish is about L.4800 ; valued 
rent, L.1801 Scots. 

Wages. — Men-servants receive from L. 4 to L. 6 during the 
half-year, exclusive of victuals; women from L.1, 15s, to L. 2, 5s. 
The ordinary wages of labourers are Is. per day with, and Is. 6d. 
without victuals ; women receive 6d. Carpenters, Is. 6d. masons, 
2s. per day. Tailors, shoemakers, and smiths charge according to 
their work. 

Husbandry and Produce. — The system of farming by a regular 
rotation of cropping is well understood in this parish, and would 
be practised by the tenantry, if adequate encouragement was held 
out to them to do so. But short leases, and sometimes no leases 
at all, with rack-rents, and harvest frosts, do not afford such an 
encouragement. The produce is bear, oats, and potatoes. In 
plentiful years, the growers can get but little for these commodi- 
ties, on account of their distance from a regular market ; and in 
scarce years, when prices are high, and a market could be got at 
home, they have then unfortunately little or nothing to sell. We 
are of opinion, that, during the last two years, more than 2000 bolls 
of oatmeal have been imported to this parish from Strathspey, 
Athole, and Fort- William. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of sheep in this parish is the 
black-faced. This kind is supposed to be more hardy, and to stand 
the winter better, than a Cheviot stock. The number of sheep 
that pasture on our hills, we should suppose to exceed 40,000. The 
rearing of sheep yields a somewhat sure return, at a comparatively 
small expense. At the same time, sheep-farmers are liable to 
heavy losses, in stormy winters and unfavourable springs. Black- 
cattle are also reared. The system followed with respect to them 
is to sell the stots to south country drovers, when six-quarters old, 
and to keep the queys. None is fed for the butcher, except for 
home consumption ; and such are fed for the most part on sum- 
mer grass. The small quantity of turnip grown is given to the, 
cows that are giving winter milk. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— The nearest market-town is Ziing- 
ussie, distant ten miles ; Fort- William is distant forty to the west; 
Inverness, fifty-five to the north-east. We have had a daily post foe 
the last three years. There is a regular intercourse with thesq 



430 



INVERNESS-SHIRK. 



places, and also with Perth, by carriers ; and the Highland mail 
passes twice a-day north and south, through a corner of the parish. 

Roads. — Till within the last twenty years, the roads in this pa- 
rish were very bad indeed. About that time, the Parliamentary 
road from Fort- William, till it meets the Highland road at the 
Bridge of Spey, near Kingussie, was made under the direction of 
the late Mr Thomas Telford. This road has been of very great 
advantage not merely to this parish, but to the whole of Badenoch. 
There is a handsome wooden bridge over the Spey, at the church 
of Laggan. There is another stone bridge on the line of the mi- 
litary road at Garvamore, one at the burn of Cluny, and two over 
the Mathie. There are few inclosures in the parish. This is 
felt to be a very great want. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in the centre of the 
population. It is seven miles east from the old church, and about 
the same distance from the eastern extremity of the parish. It 
was built in 1785, and is now very much out of repair. Mr Baillie 
is willing to build a new one, and it is probable that the other he- 
ritors will consent to this. The church may hold about 600 sitters. 
All the seats are free. The glebe, at one time, was contiguous to 
the old church. It was exchanged, about forty-six years ago, for a 
piece of ground adjoining the new church. The terms on which 
the presbytery were to consent to the excambion, are recorded in 
the presbytery books. But the actual deed of excambion was not 
recorded,— if, indeed, such a deed was ever executed. The pre- 
sent glebe contains about 24 acres of very inferior, hard, miserable 
soil. In consequence of a privilege of pasture in the adjoining hills, 
it sets for L.18 a year of rent. The clergyman has no manse, but 
receives L.50 a year in lieu of one, and lives on a small farm in 
the vicinity of the church. 

The stipend is the minimum, of which L.73, 2s. 7d. are paid by 
Government, with L.ll for communion elements. 

The number of male heads of families in communion with the 
church is 36. The number of communicants is about 120. There 
is a Roman Catholic chapel in the parish. The number belong- 
ing to this class, may be about 200. With the exception of these 
and of a few others who belong to no sect, the whole inhabitants 
attend the parish church, very regularly, except in bad weather. 

Poor. The number upon the poor's roll is about 50. Our 

yearly collections fluctuate from L.12 to L.26. The whole col- 
lections, along with fines on ecclesiastical delinquents, and on 
poachers, who are sometimes caught in their misdeeds, after pay- 



LAGGAN.

ing- necessary expenses, are divided among the poor, in various pro- 
portions, according to their necessities. There is, besides, a sum 
of L.51 of mortified money, the interest of which is divided among 
certain persons mentioned in the will of the donor.  

Catechist.—~The minister catechises the people once a year. 
Diets of catechising are well attended. For some years previous 
to 1 832, there was a catechist employed between this parish and 
the neighbouring parish of Kingussie. The half of his salary was 
paid by the Society for Propagating Christian Cnowledge, the 
other half by the ministers. 

Education. — At present, the only school we have is the parochial, 
which is attended, throughout the year, by from 100 to 150 scho- 
lars on an average. The parents are very anxious to procure the 
means of education to their children. But a great proportion are 
so poor that they cannot afford to keep them long at school ; and 
even during their attendance, three and sometimes four read from 
one book, — the parents not being able to supply a sufficient num- 
ber. 

There is another district in the parish very much in need of a 
teacher. It is on Mr Baillie's property ; and we have sanguine 
hopes that he will afford the necessary accommodations. In that 
event, we trust that we shall not appeal in vain to the Committee 
of the General Assembly for an endowment. 

The schoolmaster receives the maximum salary, and teaches 
gratis such poor children as the minister recommends. The school 
fees, in general, are not well paid. The school-house is in tole- 
rably good repair ; but the dwelling-house is in a very uncomfort- 
able state. This, however, is very much the schoolmaster's own 
fault, in not applying to have it repaired; for the heritors are not 
backward in doing what is just and proper in matters of this kind. 

Inns and IVJdsky Shops. — We have a superabundance of these in 
the parish ; and their influence on the morals of the people is 
most injurious. 

Fuel. — The fuel generally used is peats. In some parts of the 
parish, peat mosses are becoming rather scarce, in others they are 
abundant. Some people drive coals from Fort- William, a dis- 
tance of forty miles, and find them in the end cheaper than peats, 
which they procure at a mile's distance. There is such a quantity 
of wood and roots of trees in the peat mosses, that, to procure 
fuel from among them, is a work of great labour and expense.

PRESBYTERY OF ABERNETHY, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JAMES GRANT, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography anb Natural History. 

Name, — The name of the parish is evidently derived from two 
Gaelic words, croniy signifying curved or crooked ; and daily 
signifying a plain or meadow. Close by the place where the 
church and manse are situated, the river Spey forms nearly a 
semicircle; and hence Cromdale, or the crooked dale. The pa- 
rishes of Inverallan and Advie are united to Cromdale ; but at what 
time the union took place is not ascertainable. 

Eostent, 8fc. — The united parish, which, in its shape, is extreme- 
ly irregular, extends to about 18 miles in length on the north side 
of the Spey, and about 9 on the other. Its greatest breadth is 10 
miles. It is situated in the counties of Inverness and Morav, but 
the greater part lies in the former county. It is bounded on the 
east, by the parishes of Inveravon and Knockando ; on the west, 
by Abernethy and Duthill ; on the south, by Kirkmichael ; and 
on the north, by parts of the parishes of Edinkillie, and Ardclach. 

Topographical Appearances. — There is' a complete 'mountain- 
chain of very considerable height, and covered with heath, on the 
southern part of the parish, which divides it from Kirkmichael, 
called " Cromdale hill." This chain extends in an eastern and west- 
ern direction, a distance of seven or eight miles. The north side of 
the river forms rather a contrast to that already described. Its 
sloping hills, for several miles along the course of the river, are 
clothed with deep forests of pine, larch, oak, &amp;c. It may here be. 
mentioned, that, within the last sixteen years, 1500 acres have been 
planted on the south side of the river, towards the lower extremity 
of the parish ; and it is intended, by the noble and spirited pro- 
prietor, to follow out the same system, — to plant every acre on 
which timber will grow, and which cannot be added to the culti- 
vated part of the parish with a profitable application of capital. 

Soil. — The soil of the parish, in general, is good, and yields rich 



CROMDALE. 



433 



crops ; but early frosts, frequently occur in the months of August 
and September, and in one night blasts all the crops in several 
parts of the parish. 

Climate. — The climate is allowed to be extremely healthy, but, 
owing to the great elevation of the parish above the level of the 
sea, probably 600 feet, rather cold and changeable. Winter leaves 
us reluctantly, continuing during the [greater part of spring,and 
it often arrives so early as the end of October. The most fre- 
quent winds are the west and north-east. 

Geology. — Limestone [Primitive of the best quality is found in 
great abundance in some parts of the parish. Large quantities of it 
are prepared by the tenants for sale, and also for their own use in 
agriculture and building. There is scarcely a tenant in the parish, 
occupying a L. 5 farm, who has not his lime-kiln. There is also 
great abundance of granite, presumed, by well qualified judges, to 
be equal, both in appearance and durability, to the famous Aber- 
deen granite. Associated with the granites are various other rocks 
of the primitive class of geologists. 

Zoology. — The only wild animals now found in the parish are, 
the fox, badger, polecat, and weasel. Roe, partridges, black and 
red grouse, with brown and white hares, still abound. Ptarmigan 
also, it is said, have been shot on the highest parts of Cromdale 
hill. 

Hydrography. — There are no springs in the parish worthy of 
notice. There are several small lakes, but the most famous is that 
of Lochindorb, which, with its castle, shall be afterwards noticed. 
The Spey is the only river of note passing through the parish. 
Notwithstanding all the precautious used in securing the fish at the 
mouth of the river, the salmon contrive to pass, and force their 
way this length, and even to the source of the stream, affording 
the angler many an hour's pleasant amusement. There are seve- 
ral pools in the parish inferior to none, for angling, in the whole 
course of the river. 

Plantations. — There is not now a parish in Scotland, it is be- 
lieved, which contains an equal extent of plantations. Upwards 
of 2500 acres have been planted within the last twenty-six years, 
and there is a fully larger extent of old plantations. A vast num- 
ber of the old trees, larch and common fir, have grown to a very 
large size. Several trees measure 30 inches diameter at the root, 
and 8 inches at 70 feet in height. Many of the old trees from 
these plantations, especially from the close neighbourhood of

INVEKNESS-SHIIIE. 



Castle Grant, have been taken to Garmouth for ship masts. They 
are of great value; no less than L. 7 were offered the other day 
for a larch tree just as it stood in the forest. There is also a very 
considerable extent of natural wood, oak, birch, alder, &amp;c. It 
 may here be mentioned, that in the church-yard of Cromdale, 
there is a venerable beech tree of great antiquity ; its branches are 
of such enormous extent, that it is capable of overshadowing up- 
wards of ] 000 people. 

II.— Civil History. 
Historical Events.— T\\\s parish was the scene of many sangui- 
nary feudal conflicts ; but the battle which took place on the 
" Haughs of Cromdale," on the 1st of May 1690, was the most 
memorable. The cause of James 11. having become desperate 
by the death of John Graham, of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, 
at Killiecrankie, in 1689, he made a bold effort to renew the war 
in the Highlands. General Buchan was dispatched with 1500 
men, of different clans, to lay waste the low country. On their 
march through Strathspey, they plundered as they went along, and 
committed many serious depredations in the lower parts of the 
country. By this time. Sir Thomas Livingstone, who had been 
stationed at Inverness with a large 7orce of cavalry and infantry, 
resolved to check them. Buchan and his force, hearing of his 
determination and approach, returned to the Highlands. On the 
1st of May 1690, by break of day, Livingstone arrived with his 
troops at Derraid, near Castle Grant; and, in order that their 
movements might not be known, they were directed down the val- 
ley of Auchinarrow, a very sequestered spot, and to cross the Spey 
below Dellachapple. General Buchan and his army had come to 
Cromdale on the 30th of April, and, considering it prudent to 
keep near the hills, encamped that night at Lethendy, a farm 
at the foot of the hill of Cromdale. They had some advanced 
guards or sentries placed near the church of Cromdale, close 
by the river; and these, observing Livingstone's troops fording 
the Spey, immediately alarmed the camp ; but the King's troops 
attacked them, before they were even able to dress themselves, 
much less to form, or prepare for action. They fought gallantly 
notwithstanding; but were at length compelled to take to flight. 
According to some accounts, there were above one hundred killed, 
and sixty made prisoners. Others have it that the Highlanders 
had four hundred killed and taken prisoners ; and state Living- 
stone's loss at about one hundred killed, and several prisoners.

Eminent Men — Family of Grant. — The names and biography of 
the family of Grant of Grant are honourably interwoven in the his- 
tory of the British empire. Historians do not exactly agree about the 
origin of the Grants, the precise time of their settlementin Scotland, 
or whether they were of the aborigines of the country. It is, how- 
ever, most fully ascertained, from the best authenticated sources, 
that they were a very powerful family, and made a considerable 
figure in Scotland upwards of 600 years ago. The first of this 
family found on record is Gregorius, or Gregory de Grant, she- 
rilF principal of Inverness, Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness-shires, 
in the reign of King Alexander II., who succeeded to the crown 
of Scotland in the year 1214, and died in 1249. At this time 
Gregory was also proprietor of the lands of Stratherrick. 

Sir John Grant, great-grandson of Gregory, was the first of his 
family, it is believed, who got possession of part of the lands of 
Strathspey, by a royal gift from King David II., about the year 
1346. This gentleman frequently distinguished himself, both in 
the field, and as a diplomatist. He commanded a battalion of 
his clan and followers, in the right wing of the army, at the battle 
of Hallidon hill. In the year 1359, he and two other distinguish- 
ed individuals were appointed ambassadors to the court of France, 
to renew the ancient league between Scotland and that kingdom, 
and to transact other state affairs. This embassy they discharg- 
ed with much credit and ability. Sir John, after this period, 
was frequently sent to the court of England, to negotiate state 
affairs. 

The necessary brevity of this Account precludes the possibility 
of taking notice of many individuals of the family of Grant, who 
greatly signalized themselves in the two opposite professions of the 
gown and the sword; and, therefore, we shall only mention one 
more, Alexander Grant of Grant, who, doubtless, was one of the 
most distinguished men of his day in Scotland. He rose to the 
rank of Brigadier- General; and, during the war in the' reign of 
Queen Anne, he served with great applause, and performed many 
brilliant exploits. Brigadier Grant was the inseparable compa- 
nion and bosom friend of that great man, John, Dqke of Argyle. 
He was one of the commissioners who settled the articles of union 
between England and Scotland, and a member of the first five Bri- 
tish Parliaments ; and withal, according to the testimony of an im- 
partial historian, equally qualified for the camp and court, and alike 
uncorrupted and faithful in both. Brigadier Grant died at Edin- 



436 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



burgh in 1719, and was interred in the Abbey church of Holvrood 
House. 

Mr Colquhoun Grant, of the Burnside family, in this parisii, 
and uncle to Captain Gregory Grant, R. N., now at Burnside, 
when a young man, greatly signalized himself in the army of 
Prince Charles Edward Stuart. He was present at the battle of 
Prestonpans, where he evinced great bravery. He, in particular, 
displayed the utmost boldness and courage in chasing a band of 
dragoons, from the field of battle, up to the very gates of Edin- 
burgh Castle ; and showed great dexterity subsequently in making 
his escape from the town. Colquhoun Grant was the intimate 
friend and companion of the celebrated John Roy Stuart, and fre- 
quently shared the same fate with him in the dangers of the field. 
On the downfal of the Stuart cause, they were alike compelled to 
seek concealment ; and, with blasted hopes, spent many a weari- 
some day and night, amongst the hills of Cromdale. Mr Grant 
afterwards settled in Edinburgh as a Writer to the Signet, and 
realized a very handsome fortune. He died in the year 1790. 

The late Sir William Grant, Master of the Rolls, if not a na- 
tive of this parish, came to reside in it, while very young. His 
father, James Grant, was tenant of the farm of Delchroy, on the 
north side of the Spey, directly opposite the Old Kirk of Advie. 
There are several second and third cousins, and one first cousin 
of Sir William's still in the parish. It is well known that Sir 
William Grant distinguished himself in the House of Commons 
as an able debater and coadjutor of Pitt. After filling several 
high appointments connected with the law department, he was 
made Master of the Rolls in 1801, the functions of which office 
he continued to discharge for a period of sixteen years with great 
credit to himself and advantage to the public. Mr Charles Butler, 
in his Reminiscences, speaks of him in the following terms : 
' The most perfect model of judicial eloquence which has come 
under the observation of the reminiscent, is that of Sir William 
Grant. In hearing him, it was impossible not to think of the 
character given of Menelaus by Homer, or rather by Pope, that 
' he spoke no. more than just the thing he ought.'" Sir William 
retired from public life in 1817, and died on the 25th of May 1832. 

It must be added under this head, that Sir James M'Grigor, 
Bart,, who has, for a period of twenty-six or twenty-seven years, 
so ably presided over the medical department of the army, is a 

 He was descended of the Craigchrochkau Grants.

native of this parish. Sir James has given many proofs decisive 
of his ardent attachment to his native parish, and of the Hvely in- 
terest he takes in the welfare of its inhabitants. This amiable and 
distinofuished man is well known as the author of some valuable 
medical works. His services, at the head of his department, du- 
rino' the whole of the Peninsular war, were allowed to be of the 
greatest importance, and frequently mentioned in the Duke of 
Wellington's Dispatches in the most laudatory terms. According 
to the parochial register. Sir James M'Grigor was born 'on the 
9th of April 1771, so that the, worthy Baronet has just completed 
his seventieth year. 

Land-Oioners. — The Right Honourable the Earl of Seafield 
is sole proprietor of the parish. It was before-mentioned that the 
Grants got possession of part of the lands of Strathspey, by a 
royal gift, about 500 years ago. 

Parochial Registers. — There are three volumes of parish re- 
gisters, the oldest commencing in 1726 ; but all have been im- 
perfectly kept, till about 1780. 

Antiquities. — The old Castle of Muckerach, in the north-west 
part of the parish, is rather a picturesque ruin, and beautifully 
situated ; but it is now much dilapidated ; the roof has entirely 
fallen away. Muckerach was the first possession of the Grants 
of Rothiemurchus. The castle was built by Patrick Grant, se- 
cond son of John Grant of Freuchy, and fourteenth laird of Grant, 
and Margaret Stewart, daughter of the Earl of Athol, his spouse, 
in 1598. To~this son the Laird of Grant gave a feu-charter on 
the lands of Muckerach ; but on his subsequently acquiring the 
lands of Rothiemurchus, he gave them to his son, and redeemed 
Muckerach. 

The celebrated Castle or Fort of Lochindorb is the only other 
antiquity of note in the parish. The castle is built on an island 
in a large lake of that name, distant about seven or eight 
miles north of Castle Grant. The island is fully more than a 
Scotch acre in extent, and every part of it is occupied by the cas- 
tellated wall, in many places 20 feet high, and supposed to have 
been much higher. According to Mr Shaw, in his History of 
the Province of Moray, when the Earl of March defeated and 
killed the Earl of Athol at Kilblair in 1335, and raised the siege 
of Kildrummie Castle, the Earl of Athol's Lady fled to the Castle 
of Lochindorb. Sir Alexander Gordon laid siege to it ; but next 
year, he was obliged to raise the siege. The castle and adjacent

grounds belong to the Earl of Seafield. On the south side of 
the lake, a neat and commodious shooting lodge is built, sur- 
rounded with thriving belts of plantations, which afford much 
shelter, and are at the same time highly ornamental. 

Mansion- Houses. — Castle Grant, one of the seats of the family 
of Grant, is the only building in the parish entitled to particular 
notice. The house is a very ancient and magnificent building, 
beautifully situated on the north side of the Spey, and about the 
distance of two miles from that river. It is environed with ex- 
tensive forests of aged trees of amazing stature and variety. The 
house is a high quadrangular pile of several storeys, with loYer 
wings added to the length of the opposite sides. Within the last 
few years, the castle has undergone very extensive repairs and im- 
provements. The view, from the house is truly magnificent. In the 
distance, the Grampians are seen towering in majestic grandeur, 
and their bases clothed with forests of dark waving pines. The 
internal "arrangements of the house are in excellent keeping with 
its venerable and commanding exterior. The apartments are 
large, well finished, and superbly furnished. The dining room, 
"which is 47 by 27 feet, and of a proportionable height, is a most 
magnificent hall, altogether worthy of the chieftain of a powerful 
clan. There are many valuable paintings in the house by Van- 
dyke, Guide, Rubens, Poussin, &amp;c. ; but the Death of Patrocles, 
by Hamilton, is reckoned the best in the collection. In the front 
hall, there are from 30 to 40 portraits of gentlemen of the name 
of Grant, said to be excellent likenesses. In the castle there is 
also a very extensive armoury, where there are to be seen specimens 
of the most rare and ancient armour. " Every thing within and 
without," says Robertson in his View of Agriculture in the County 
of Inverness, " denotes the habitation of a chieftain, and brings 
to remembrance those days in which the head of every tribe was 
surrounded by his own clan. His castle was their fortress ; his 
approbation was their pride ; his protection was both their duty 
and their interest. In his safety their own fate was involved ; in 
his hall, stood the board to which they were always welcome ; there 
he sat with all the feelings of a father in the midst of his chil- 
dren ; he acted as their general in the day of battle, their judge 
in the lime of peace, and was at all times their friend."

Language of the People.- — Gaelic is the language generally 
spoken by the great body of the common people, particularly the 
old ; but almost the whole population, young and old, speak and 
understand the English language. Indeed, in the lower part of 
the parish, English is preferred, from its proximity to Inveravon and 
Knockando, where no Gaelic is spoken. 

Character of the People. — The inhabitants of the parish are, 
on the whole, sober, honest, and industrious. They are remark- 
able, in common with the other people of Strathspey, for their 
warmth of attachment to their chief; they are uniformly respect- 
ful to those in stations superior to their own, and have seldom been 
charged with the commission of crime. They are, with very few 
exceptions, regular in their attendance on religious ordinances, 
and it is hoped that a few among them are decidedly pious. 
Smuggling is entirely abandoned by them; but they cannot yet 
be altogether acquitted of poaching in game or salmon. Their 
ordinary food consists of oat and barley meal, milk and potatoes. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The latest survey of the united parish was com- ' 
pleted in 1810. According to it, the parish contained at that 
time. 

1. Of arable land, . . 5,306 0 23

The ground planted since 1810 falls to be deducted from No. 
3, and added to No. 2, and in like manner the land brought into 
tillage to be deducted from No. 3, and added to No. 1.° As to 
these, then, it is believed, that about 2500 Scots acres have been 
planted, and at least 500 brought into cultivation. It is difficult 
to condescend upon the number of acres that might be added to 
the cultivated part of the parish, with a profitable application of

capital, but it is not below the mark to say tliat above 1000 acres 
might be thus added. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of the land may be stated 
at about L.l per acre, including the privilege of hill common, and 
peat moss, which, in general, the tenants enjoy. 

Rate of Wages. — The allowance to day-labourers without main- 
tenance, is from Is. 6d. to 2s. per day ; to masons, from 15s. to 
18s. per week; to carpenters, from 12s. to 15s. per week. Men- 
servants receive, includingmaintenance, from L. to L.6 half-year- 
ly; women, from L.l, 15s. to L. 2 ; and boys, from L. 2 to 
L.2, 10s. 

Husbandry. — The few sheep reared in the parish, are generally 
of the black-faced kind. There are also a few Cheviots, which the 
gentlemen and principal tenants keep for family use. The black- 
cattle consist chiefly of the West Highland breed, and are rec- 
koned very superior. At the Highland Society great cattle-show 
held at Inverness in 1839, the first premium was awarded to a te- 
nant of this parish, for the best Highland bull. The breed of 
horses has likewise been greatly improved, during the last twenty 
years. Farming is carried on in the parish on the most improved 
system. The rotations of cropping are the five and six years' 
shifts. Trenching and draining have been done to a very great 
extent, on almost every farm in the parish. The duration of 
leases is nineteen years. The farm-buildings, and many of the 
fences, paling, and dry-stone dikes are substantial. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markei~Town. — Grantown is the only market-town in the pa- 
rish. It was founded in the year 1776, by the late inestimable Sir 
James Grant of Grant, Bart, in the midst of an extensive uncul- 
tivated moor. Its appearance, since that period, has undergone a 
great change. According to Mr Anderson, the talented author 
of an interesting volume on the Highlands and Islands, " no vil- 
lage in the north of Scotland can compare with Grantown in neat- 
ness and regularity, and in beauty of situation." The town stands 
at the distance of nearly two miles to the west of Castle Grant, 
and about half a mile north of the Spey. Near the centre of the 
town, there is a spacious oblong square, 180 by 700 feet in length. 
On the south side of the square, stands the Speyside Orphan Hos- 
pital, built on a neat design in 1824. Many years ago, a consi- 
derable sum of money was left by Lady Grant of Monymusk, for 
charitable purposes. A third part of this fund was allocated by 



CllOMDALE. 



441 



her Ltidyship for Scotland, the object and place to be fixed by the 

late Dr Gregory Grant of Edinburgh, a native of this parish, and 
brother of Mr Colquhoun Grant, already mentioned. Considera- 
ble additions have since been made to the original fund by the fa- 
mily of Grant. There are at present about thirty children in the 
hospital, boys and girls. None are admitted under seven, or con- 
tinued above fourteen years of age. According to the deed of 
settlement, the children admitted must be natives of either of the 
parishes of Cromdale, Abernethy, Duthill, Inveraven, or Knock- 
ando. All the children are supplied with clothing, board, and 
education. The boys attend during the day in the Grantown 
school, and the girls are taught by a matron, in the house, who. 
also superintends the establishment. The institution is under the 
direction and management of the Earl of Seafield, Captain Gre- 
gory Grant, R. N., Burnside, Captain Grant, factor of Strath- 
spey, and the ministers of the parishes already mentioned. The 
sum available for the yearly expenditure of the institution, is 
nearly L.200. A remarkably neat and commodious school-house, 
capable of containing 200 scholars, was built by the proprietor two 
or three years ago, on the north side of the town, at a very con- 
siderable expense. The church is situated a little to the north of 
the town, and affords accommodation for about 900 people. A 
branch of the National Bank of Scotland was established in Gran- 
town in 1829, and a braacli of the Caledonian Bank in 1839. 
There are several handsome shops in the town, and considerable 
business transacted. Its population is close upon 1000. 

Means'of Communication — There is a post-office in Grantown, 
through which there is a daily communication with Carr bridge, 
Forres, and Ballindalloch. The roads leading to these places are 
excellent, and kept in thorough repair. There are also regular 
carriers from Grantown to Forres and Inverness every week. Aber- 
deen carriers come to Grantown weekly. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The silaationoHhe parish church of Crom- 
dale, on the south back of the Spey, which intersects the parish, is 
by nomeans convenient to thegreatbulkof the population. Abridge 
on the Spey, opposite the church, would confer an unspeakable 
boon on the people of Cromdale, and it is hoped that this want will 
ere long be supplied. The church was built in 1809, and is in good 
repair. It affords accommodation for about 900 sitters, and the 
sittings are free. Since September 1835, there has been an ordained 
minister in Grantown, who regularly preaches there, and admini-

sters the other ordinances of religion. He is paid L. 60 by the 
Earl of Seafield, and L. 20 by the Comrtiittee for the Mangement 
of the Royal Bounty. Both churches are, in general, well at- 
tended ; and the number of communicants in the parish is upwards 
of 300. Numerous Sabbath schools, which are remarkably well 
attended by both young and old, are established throughout the 
parish. There are no Dissenting chapels of any kind, except a 
Baptist meeting-house in Grantown. 

The manse, which was built in 1834, is a commodious and 
handsome house. There are two glebes, one at Cromdale, and 
the other at Advie, both of the yearly value of about L. 25. The 
stipend by the last augmentation in 1819, is 16 chalders, half 
meal, half barley, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion element 
money. 

Education. — The total number of endowed schools in the pa- 
rish is six. Of these, four are parochial, each teacher receiving 
a salary, L. 12, 16s. 7d. per annum, with school fees. The school- 
master of Advie, situated in Morayshire, is entitled to a share of 
the Dick Bequest. This rather uncommon number of parochial 
schools was deemed necessary, on account of the extent and po- 
pulation of the parish. The other two schools are in the village 
of Grantown, and both gratuitously supported by the proprietor. 
The teacher of the grammar school receives a salary of L.25 a-year, 
and the school fees are very considerable, the average number of 
scholars during the year being not under 150. The other is au 
infant school, established by the late Honourable Mrs Grant of 
Grant. The teacher of it, a female, receives a yearly salary of 
L. 15, with other perquisites. 

There may be some few old people in the parish still, who are 
unable to read, but their number is exceedingly small. The 
schools are well attended, particularly during the winter months, 
and the majority of them are remarkably well taught. The in- 
habitants are sensible of the advantages they derive from these 
schools ; but two or three more are much wanted. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 150 ; and the average sum allotted 
to each, per year, according to their necessities, is from 5s. to 
L. 2. The annual amount of contributions for their relief is 
about L. 75 ; of which, about L. 55 are collected in the two 
churches, and L. 20 are the interest of several sums left as legacies 
for the poor. The family of Grant also give stated supplies of

meal for distribution amongst the most necessitous. There seems 
no indisposition on the part of the poor to accept of parochial 
aid. 

The only prison in the parish is that of Grantown. There are 
six inns or public houses. Four markets are held in Grantown 
during the year, besides a number of cattle trysts. The fuel 
chiefly used is peat. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

With respect to the more striking variations between the pre- 
sent state of the parish, and that which existed at the time of the 
former Account, I may generally refer to what has been already 
stated under the different heads of inquiry. Almost all the farms 
and buildings present instances of the greatest improvement. This 
is, doubtless, in a great measure, to be attributed to the liberality 
of the landlord, who gives every encouragement and considerable 
compensation to the tenants for improving waste land, building 
houses and farm-steadings. Much credit is also due to the 
Strathspey Farmer's Club, consisting of the gentlemen of the dis- 
trict, for the improved mode of husbandry. 

In regard to moral changes, there is not much to remark. It 
may be proper, however, to mention, that a very decided improve- 
ment has taken place in the mode of conducting funerals ; and 
penny-weddings, which were very common in the parisha few 
years ago, are entirely suppressed.

PRESBYTERY OF NAIRNE, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV, ALEXANDER CAMPBELL, A.M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The precise signification of Croy cannot be deter- 
mined. The name is found in Holland, Belgium, and Brit- 
tany ; and in these countries, the etymon may be ascertained. 
The word most analogous to it in the Celtic language is criiadk 
hard, — which is descriptive of its physical features, these consist- 
ing of a long continuous ridge of hard mortar, covered with dry 
stinted heath, extending through its whole length, and from its 
summit level, at about 300 feet above the level of the sea, slightly 
declining to the east. Dalcross, Dealganross, is from the Gaelic 
words, Dal aig ceann Rois, signifying " the dale at the end of the 
ravine," — which is accurately descriptive of the locality. The date 
of the union is uncertain ; but from charters in the family of Inches, 
it must have taken place between the year 1446 and 1500. Dal- 
cross of old formed a part of the Lordship of Lovat, and is all si- 
tuated in the county of Inverness ; Croy is partly situated in the 
county of Inverness and partly in Nairne ; but so confused and 
commingled are the boundaries, that they are not to be easily de- 
termined. 

Boundaries. — These are so irregular, that, without a diagram, 
no correct idea of them can be conveyed. From five miles to the 
east of the church, the form resembles an irregular parallelogram, 
with offsets to the south of the River Nairne, its natural boundary. 
From two miles west from the church, the parish stretches to the south 
for about nine miles, where it meets the northern summit of the 
Strathdearn mountains ; whence it gradually descends, forming 
every imaginable angle and sinuosity in a south-west direction, 
where it meets the River Nairne nearly opposite the church of 
Daviot. About five miles to the west from the parish church and 



CROY AND DALCROSS. 



445 



near Culloden Field, the parish is intersected, for some hundred 
yards, hy the iiarishes of Petty and Daviot. From this point, 
it extends for about three miles, where it is again intersected 
by the parishes of Inverness and Daviot; whence it extends in 
a south-west direction, and terminates in a point at the junction 
-of the parishes of Dunlichity, The extreme length from the 
north-east of Blarna Fiadh, Deer's Forest, to the south-west 
of Culduthel Moor, is upwards of twenty miles, and average breadth 
about three and a half miles; the whole contents being about 
44,800 Imperial, or 35,471 Scots acres. 

Soil. — In the eastern division of the parish the soil is of every 
description; but scarcely two continuous acres can be found of the 
same nature and quality. Here sand, there compact mortar; here 
the finest vegetable mould, there cold and wet, a ferruginous crust 
from an inch to three inches in thickness, which, though exposed to 
the atmosphere, undergoes no change. Trench-ploughing has not 
been tried; without which, thorough draining would be of no avail, 
as surface water is found stagnant within a few inches of drains 
made with skill and care. In the centre of the parish, whatever 
might have been the original quality of the soil, by long and skil- 
ful cultivation, it is reduced to the finest mould, particularly the 
estate of Croy. The same may be said of the estate of Dalcross. 
Though the greater part is still under the most wretched system 
of husbandry, the soil is of a rich vegetable mould, from two to 
three feet in depth, with a gentle declivity, so that no water in 
any season can lie on the surface. 

Between Dalcross and the western district of the parish, called 
Leys, there are about 1700 acres of moor nearly level; the soil is 
composed of sand, mortar, and clay, with here and there some 
oxide of iron, with a fine southern exposure,— and susceptible of 
improvement to arable land .ora plantation of oaks,' larch, and fir. 
The soil of the Leys is of various kinds, but, for the most part, is ra- 
ther siliceous, if not gravelly, incumbent on strata of red sandstone. 
The upper end of Inches in this district forms an exception ; the 
soil is found to be exceedingly rich, consisting of a whitish mould, 
composed of alumina and silica, with a portion of calcareous and 
vegetable matter. To the northward, the alumina and vegetable 
matter gradually disappear, and give place to the silex and oxide of 
iron. Along the south banks of the River Nairne, soil is generally 
light and gravelly, but fertile under proper management. Culdoich 



40 INVERNESS-SHIRE. 

and Daltulich are rich and incumbent on a species of schistus, and 
though with a high and northern exposure, bear luxuriant crops. 

Geology and Miner ahgij.— The geology of the parish is rather 
monotonous. The whole of the level track of country to the north 
of the Grampians consists of granite, gneiss, old red-sandstone, 
lias, unconsolidated beds of clay and gravel, &amp;c. Though gra- 
nite belongs to no particular ore in the north of Scotland, it hap- 
pens to underlie all the other rocks. Gneiss is next in order of 
succession, and then old red sandstone. When granite appears 
at the surface, it forms the loftiest mountains ; gneiss, the next most 
-elevated, — while the old red sandstone seldom rises higher than 
gently sloping ridges. This parish does not extend so far south 
as the line where the granite appears. The southern localities 
comprehend part of a longitudinal range of gneiss strata, which 
present a high degree of inclination. This range is, for the most 
part, covered with heath, and to the south of it, bare granite crags 
may be seen bounding the prospect, while to the north, old red 
sandstone may be traced under woods and cultivated fields. The 
ridge of gneiss to which we have referred, constitutes the rising 
lands to the south of the parish, and consists principally of granite 
worn down by water and deposited in lamina at the bottom of the 
ocean. Its elevation was evidently the result of the upburstingof the 
southern masses of granite, either in a fluid or solid state; but no 
such mode of elevation will explain the present position of the 
sandstone, which must have been deposited after the appearance 
of the primary hills above the sea, as is evident from the rolled 
fragments which it contains ; accordingly, we find the sandstone 
lying unconformably on the gneiss — the opposite of the position 
of the gneiss in relation to the granite. Immediately to the north 
of the gneiss ridge, is the valley of the River Nairn, the southern 
side of which is very remarkable for what are termed parallel roads. 
The term is inapplicable to the terraces in this locality, for they 
are nowhere perfectly parallel in the lines of their longitudinal ex- 
tension, neither are they horizontal — a fact which, with many 
others, shows that they were not left by retiring waters, but heav- 
ed from below by violent action. They run along the flanks of 
the ridge of gneiss previously adverted to, at an altitude of 500 or 
600 feet above the Moray Frith, and have no corresponding marks 
on the north side of the valley, which is comparatively low. They 
frequently pass into one another, merge into hillocks and waved 
tracks of gravel, and present other numerous appearances which 



CnOY AND DALCROSS. 



447 



clearly demonstrate their marine origin. They follow the slight 
inclination of the valley of the Nairn, and of the plateau of sand- 
stone on the north, but have no angular relation to the gneiss 
ridge on the south, — indicating that they were thrown out of the 
sea by the same convulsive movement which elevated the sand- 
stone. That they are upheaved beaches does not admit of a doubt, 
and the mode of their original formation is equally obvious. The. 
rains of the atmosphere, and the tides, waves, and currents of the 
sea are incessantly wearing down lines of coast, and depositing the 
detrirus at high water-mark in the shape of a terrace. This ter- 
race is thrown up by an earthquake, another is formed at the low- 
er level by a similar process, and is destined to undergo emersion 
in its turn. This is the actual economy of the earth, and there 
can be Httle doubt but the same laws prevailed at the period of 
the formation of the terraces under notice. That,the whole ofthe 
parish was under the sea, appears from the shape of the surface ; 
where soft gravel or sand occurs, it is there, undulated like the bo- 
som of the deep during a severe tempest, and frequently rises in- 
to conical mounds, apparently the result of vertical agency at the 
confluence of currents on tides. 

Old Red Sandstone. — The old red sandstone is nowhere much ex- 
posed, but it probably consists, as in adjacent localities, of strata of 
conglomerate cornstone, limestone, and fine quartzose sandstone. 
It forms a very extraordinary plateau to the north of the valley of 
the Nairn, which extends all the way from the south-west part of 
the parish of Dores, along Loch Ness, to a short distance from the 
town of Nairn, in length about 34 miles. This plateau presents 
from the summit level at Culduthel moor, a very gentle inclina- 
tion towards the east, and nearly the same to the west, probably 
no more than a few yards in a mile ; the whole being covered by 
thick beds of gravel and sometimes lias, which are all along, with 
part ofthe sandstone, exposed by the river on the south. No ich- 
thyolites of determined character have been found in the parish. 

Lias. — Liasitic limestone of a blue colour, and clays have been 
found in several insulated localities in the north of Scotland, such 
as at Ethie, on the north side of the Moray Frith. To the east of 
Clava, we likewise discovered a detached portion of that forma- 
tion : the lime has been burnt for economical purposes. No am- 
monites have been found, but septaria, or ironstone are numerous, 
and mistaken for organisms. 

Unconsolidated Strata. — Above the last-mentioned rock, nu- 



448 



INVERNESis-SIIIRE. 



merous thick beds of gravel, sand, &amp;c. occur, which present a very 
enigmatical spectacle to the eye of the geologist. From what has 
been stated, we consider it evident that they were formed under 
the sea ; but the absence of organic remains leaves us in the dark 
regarding the period of their formation. They are probably equi- 
valent to the English and continental oolitic cretaceous, and ter- 
tiary strata ; a supposition which is strengthened by the ocurrence 
of certain organic remains similar to those in Morayshire. There 
are several quarries of excellent freestone in different parts, parti- 
cularly on the estate of Inches, which chiefly supplies the town of- 
Inverness ; its formation is north by west, and south by east, for 
the most part in nearly a horizontal position, in some places up- 
held to an angle of from 25° to 30°. They are obviously Neptu- 
nian, the top strata being grey, or new red sandstone, the sub- 
strata grey sandstone, streaked with red and white quartz. There 
are many erratic boulders on the surface and in the subsoil. One 
may be mentioned particularly, lying on a plain surface, 24 feet in 
length, 18 in height, and 38 across, the largest plum-pudding- 
stone in the country, and none similar within at least ten miles 
Its form is nearly an oblong square, and it is 560 tons in 
weight. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — In draining a lake at the east end of the parish, 
an artificial mound appeared within a few yards of the shore, about 
60 feet in circumference, and 5 in height. It was formed of al- 
ternate strata of stones, earth, and oak ; piles of oak being driven 
in the ground, were kept strongly fixed by transverse beams of 
smaller size. Over these were round stones, and on the surface 
some inches of fine black mould. Some fragments of brass rings, 
pieces of potteries, and the bolt of a lock, of no ordinary size, were 
found on the mound. 

At about 100 yards distance, there is a circle of large piles of 
oak, driven deep in the earth, apparently the commencement of a 
second mound ; but for what purpose they were intended, it is im- 
possible to conjecture. They could not be places of defence, as 
the one finished was so near the edge of the lake, and completely 
commanded by the opposite rising bank. While draining the lake 
by cutting a deep canal, oaks of gigantic size were found more than 
twenty feet below the surface, as sound as the day they were over- 
whelmed by water, sand, and gravel. At the same time, a canoe 
of most beautiful workmanship was found, which some modern 



CROY AND DALCllOSS. 



419 



Goth has since cut down for mean and servile purposes. The 
writer of this Account having employed some men to cut down a 
mortar bank, discovered, about six feet from the surface, several 
pieces of wood, from two to four inches square, the lamina being 
quite distinct ; but, when exposed to the atmosphere, they soon 
crumbled .into dust. So compact was the mortar, that an able- 
bodied 'man could not, with his mattock, penetrate more than two 
or three inches at a time ; and the bank had not the least appear- 
ance of any change since its original formation. To the west of 
the church, there is a large grey stone, called clach na seanaish, 
that is, " the listening stone," commemorative of those barbarous 
deeds which too frequently disgrace the memory of our ancestors. 
The Cummings, conceiving they had received some offence from 
the Mackintoshes, were determined to be revenged, and, conceal- 
ing their bloody purpose, invited the Mackintoshes to the Castle 
of Rait, where all animosities should be buried in oblivion at the 
festive board. One of the Cummings, from compunction of con- 
science, or regard for one of the intended victims, sent private no- 
tice to one of the Mackintoshes to meet him at the grey stone, to 
which, addressing himself in the audience of his friend, he disclos- 
ed the bloody and treacherous intentions of his clan. The Mac- 
kintoshes being thus made aware of the design of the rendezvous, 
nothing daunted, repaired to the castle at the appointed hour, and, 
before the Cummings could give the signal for attack, each Mac- 
kintosh plunged a dagger in the bosom of a Cumming, and only 
saved the life of the man who communicated the treachery to the 
grey stone. 

Of old, and before the records of the kingdom, there were 
extensive forests of oak, birch, fir, and hazel, which have been 
converted into moss in some places upwards of twenty feet deep, — 
one of these, Blarna Fiadgh, Deer's Forest, shows what the 
language then was, and the use to which the forest was appro- 
priated. In a moss 400 feet above the level of the sea, oaks of 
extraordinary size are dug up, some of them measuring from 50 
to 60 feet, and of proportional thickness ; and even at the height 
of 800 feet, where the parish joins the Strathdearn Hills, large 
blocks of fir are found, where now, from cold and storm, the dwarf 
willow can scarcely raise its downy and lowly head. When the 
mountain torrent sweeps away its bank or forms a new ravine, fir 
blocks are seen in different alternate strata, clearly indicating that 
the formation of these vast layers of sand and gravel could not have 



450 



INVEIINESS-SIIIRE. 



been occasioned by the same catastrophe, and at the same time. 
From the great length and straightness of the oaks and firs, it is 
evident that the forests must have been very dense, and the wes- 
terly winds not so prevalent and strong as at present ; for were it 
possible for an oak to grow now on these grounds, it must be at 
an angle of 45°, so much changed is the climate and constitution. 
There have been several coins found along the banks of the Nairn, 
probably dropped by the Royal troops on their march to Culloden, 
and of the reigns of James I. and Charles. 

Druidical Circles. — About four miles south of the church is 
Clava, m Gaelic Clavalag, remarkable for it's many Druidical cir- 
cles and cairns. The place is the most dreary and bleak the ima- 
gination can conceive — dark stinted heath, without any other vege- 
tation whatever. These circles vary from 140 to 12 yards in cir- 
cumference, and many appear not finished; five of them are of very 
considerable size. 

Four of them have been diverted from their original design and 
converted into cairns of remembrance of either good or evil. Mrs 
General Campbell, Kilravock Castle, lately caused one of them to 
be cleared of the stones, following a passage from the second circle 
to the centre, where a circular convex chamber, 12 feet in diame- 
ter, and about 10 feet in height, was discovered. There was no 
cement used in building, and the materials were of the very rudest 
description. In the centre of this, singular building, and a few 
inches from the surface, there was found a vase bedded in blue 
clay, containing ashes and calcined bones. 

With regard to the period when these circles were formed, or 
how long they were resorted as to places of devotion or administra- 
tion of justice, it is now vain to inquire. One thing is certain, that 
they were formed ages prior to the cairns, and converted into cairns 
when the original cause of their erection passed away. It mav be 
that these cairns were raised to the memory of a Druid consigned to 
a revered circle. This is more rational than to suppose that they were 
raised to perpetuate the infamy of criminals.' In the present ac- 
ceptation of the word, they are expressive of respect and affection for 
a departed friend, as ciiividh mi clach ad chani-, though it is granted 
that some Druidical expressions still lingering among us, counte- 

• The following fact is remarkable ; in the ensuing spring, young shoots of 
rasps grew up luxuriantly on the very spot from which the urn was dug, so that the 
seeds or roots of the rasps must have lain in the ground beyond the action of the sun 
and atmosphere for probably 2000 years.

nance a very opposite inference, as Is oil Icam nach rohh do luadh 
fo charnclach, I wish vour ashes were under a cairn ; 'B' fliearr 
learn bhifo cliarn chlach, I would rather be an outlaw. Yet it can 
hardlv be supposed that such care would have been taken of the ashes 
of criminals, as that succeeding ages would show such pious pains 
to perpetuate their memory. There is another Druidical circle of 
extraordinary dimensions, perfectly entire in Midleys, surrounded 
by a deep fosse. The stones are all of such prodigious size, that 
it is difficult even to imagine how, without the combination of great 
mechanical powers, they could be carried up the steep ascent. 

Records of Session. — From 1640 to 1789, the parish records 
were kept with singular care. The collections for the poor, and 
texts of Scripture, regularly entered. The names and residences 
of the various delinquents, with inquisitorial minuteness, are all 
recorded, from 1640 to 1720, a period looked on by many as the 
golden age of the church. Whatever may have been the case else- 
where, this parish was certainly then ranked with every spe- 
cies of abomination. In the black catalogue, besides the sin of 
uncleanness, may be mentioned, — drying and grinding corn and 
killing salmon on the Sabbath ; brawling, drunkenness, and fight- 
ing in Church ; defamation of character ; fightings at lykwakes ; 
casting the sieve and the sheers ; and not a few for endeavouring 
to compass their neighbour's death by charms, spells, and many 
kindred follies. The cutty-stool got little rest ; and, so late 
as 1748, a thoughtless wight, on the death of his aged mother, on a 
Sabbath evening, called together his ungodly neighbours to testify 
his sorrow by a dance, which was continued with great glee until 
Monday morning, for which unseasonable and unseemly mirth, he 
and his fiddler had to appear in sober weeds for six consecutive 
Sabbaths, on the said i7idex expurgatoi'ius, — no doubt to the great 
edification of the congregation, as the records do not furnish a 
similar demonstration of sorrow till the present day. 

The only event worthy to be recorded, is the battle of Culloden, 
fought 16th April 1746, on a bleak moor five miles south-west of 
the church. The particulars have been so often and so mi- 
nutely, and by Chambers, so faithfully and circumstantially 
narrated, that hardly anything farther can be said It may, 
however, be proper to observe, that there was one deed of such 
atrocious and execrable foulness, as can hardly find a parallel 
m the annals of the most bloody and ruthless tyrants of ancient 
or modern times, and which, though denied by the sycophants of the 



452

court, is an incontrovertible fact : Early in tiie morning after the 
battle, orders were given by the Duke of Cumberland or General 
Hawley, ;ar ignohik fratrum to inspect the wounded and mangled, 
in whom there remained any symptoms of life, and collect them 
into two heaps, and apply a six pounder to each heap : yet, 
wonderful as it may appear, one Maciver, a private, not an of- 
ficer, as stated by Chambers, though mutilated in several 
parts of his body, survived this massacre a- dismal memorial of 
Cumberland's tender mercies. The man died near Beauly, about 
the year 1796, where many are still living, who may have known 
him ; but to put the bloody deed beyond the shadow of doubt, 
the writer of this account knew for several years a John Reid, 
who fought that day in the second battalion of the Royal Scots, 
and heard from his lips, that he saw the cruel deed, and thanked 
God that he had nothing to do with the hlack wark. John fought 
at the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, and only died about the 
year 1807, in the 105th year of his age, and in the full enjoyment 
of all his mental faculties. He was a lively little man, and retain- 
ed a correct and vivid necollection of \yhat he had seen and heard. 

Buildings. — The Castle of Kilravock, built by permission of the 
Earl of Ross, stands upon a bluff rock, rising abruptly from a beau- 
tiful plain to the south of the castle, through which the river Nairn 
winds its way. At first, it consisted of a massive lofty tower with 
the usual appurtenances, to which, from time to time, additions, 
not in perfect keeping, have been made. Several of the apart- 
ments have been modernized and furnished in a splendid style, 
by the present occupant, Mrs General Campbell, who, with exqui- 
site taste and judgment, has changed the appearance of the lawns, 
gardens, and pleasure "grounds, levelling the undulations of the 
grounds, and, instead of stiff and formal angles in the alleys, sub- 
stituting elegant curvatures. This venerable pile has been the 
residence of the Roses since 1460. This family, truly an- 
cient and honourable, have been distinguished for ages in the north 
for every high and noble quality ; and, with their name almost above 
any other in this part of the kingdom, is associated the memory of 
generous, noble, and patriotic deeds. The succession in this fa- 
mily did not once diverge to a collateral branch, for upwards of 600 
years. The present proprietor, Hugh Rose, is the chief, and the 
nineteenth of his name, and twenty-fourth in lineal descent. 

General Sir John Rose of Holm, a cadet of the family of Kil- 



CnOY AND DALCROSS. 



453 



ravock, has an elegant modern mansion house in this parish : the 
property has been in the family since 1541. 

Hugh Davidson, Esq. of Cantray, has lately erected an elegant 
mansion in a lawn, almostsurrounded on the south by the river Nairn. 
The situation, though beautiful, is rather confined. Had the rising 
ground on the north been chosen for a site, the view would have 
been truly rich and variegated. Dalcross Castle was built by Lord 
Lovat, in the year 1621. The situation is singularly grand, com- 
mandincr one of the most sublime and variegated scenes in the 
kingdom J one interrupted view from Malfourvonie to the Ord of 
Caithness, extending to about 120 miles. It was bought by Mack- 
intosh of Mackintosh, about the year 1702, since which time it 
has been allowed to fall into decay. The walls are still perfectly 
entire, and, in the hands of aman of taste and judgment, might, at a 
comparatively little expense, be made one of the finest seats in the 
north, instead of an eye-sore to every one that passes by. 

Leys Castle, a princely residence, built lately by Colonel Bail- 
lie, is all that wealth, skill, and taste could render it. It stands 
at an elevation of about 300 feet above the level of the sea, and com- 
mands a most extensive view of mountain, dale, wood, and water. 
The decorations correspond ; and the grounds are laid out in the 
most scientific and tasteful manner.

Manners and Circumstances of the People. — Within the last 
twenty years, a remarkable change has taken place in the habits 
and dress of the people ; even at so late a period, it was the boast 
of the housewife to clothe her husband and children, by the work 
of her own hands. Spindles have vanished, and spinning-wheels 
will soon be seen only in museums. Those who depend on the 
profits of their farms are generally poor, alleging that the rent of 
their lands is from 10 to 30 per cent, above a remunerating price, 



454 INVERNESS-SIIIRE. 

the rent being regularly calculated to be all that can possibly be 
scraped together, after providing the humblest necessaries of life 
for the farmer. Be that as it may, that they live on the simplest 
fare, is an undeniable fact. Butcher-meat, except 'on very rare 
occasions, is unknown, and small beer a luxury. Poultry, butter, 
eggs, are all for the market. Of all the farmers in this extensive 
parish who pay L. 50, there are not more than six who occupy the 
farms of their fathers, and not more than ten of any description of 
tenants who are natives of the parish. Whatever the cause may be, 
it cannot be any desire of change on the part of the people, the 
reverse being their amiable characteristic; and, strange to say, 
such is the competition for small farms, of which this parish is 
chiefly composed, that, with many melancholy cases before their 
eyes, it is confidently believed there would be no decrease in the 
present rent rolls, were every farm in the parish out of lease.

Rent of Land. — The valued rental, which in 1767 was L. 552, 
is now L, 3278, 14s. lOfd. ; and cessed property about L. 5400. 
Rental in 1764, L. 552. 

Improvements. — The farmers of the district appear to follow 
no regular system of agriculture, and deprecate the least devia- 
tion from the ways of their fathers, as savouring of ignorance, 
pride, and novelty. The lands, overrun with weeds, seldom visited 
with manure, were forced to undergo a succession of from four to 
six white crops, and then the land, thus reduced to a caput mor- 
tiium, was kindly allowed to recover its exhausted strength by a 
rest from its labours for several years. To remove stones from 
the surface or to blast those under ground, which frequently broke 
their crazy and clumsy ploughs to pieces, or build enclosures, was 
truly in their estimation such novelties, as their fathers never heard 
of, and- of course could not be endured. Such of their cattle as 
escaped starvation by want of provender in winter, were stinted in 
growth, and unfit for sale till late in the following season. Indeed 
these fathers were famous only for the elegant curvature of their 
ridges, which might well vie with Hogarth's lines of beauty ; but 
whether these were the effects of ignorance or taste, it is hard to 
determine. It is not, however, to be supposed that this state of 
sloth and ignorance was confined to this particular district or parish. 

With respect to enclosures, it appears that the Laird of Kilra- 
vock, about the year 1740, built some miles of stone dikes, to en- 
close an extensive plantation in this parish, and so substantially

was the work performed, that it is still serviceable ; and it may 
be worth remarking, that these were the only stone dikes along the 
high road from Kilravock to Aberdeen. Fortunately at this time 
of profound ignorance, the estates of Cantray and Croy were pur- 
chased at a judicial sale about the year 1774, by Mr Davidson, a 
native of Delnies, in the parish of Nairn ; a man of singular saga- 
city, of most active powers of mind and practical good sense. 
Mr Davidson succeeded, to the astonishment of his countrymen, 
in reclaiming from useless wastes, upwards of 500 acres, by the 
expensive process of trenching, draining, blasting rocks and boul- 
ders, enclosing with double stone dikes, and sheltering the fields 
with suitable beltings of trees. His grandson, the present proprie- 
tor, has little more to do than walk in his steps ; and emulate the 
example of his honoured and patriotic ancestor, who lived to see 
his improvements yield more than 30 per cent, on the original 
outlay ; while his tenants not only profited by his example, but 
shared the sympathies of a liberal minded and a fatherly landlord. 
But Mr Davidson, though the first, is not the only one who ought 
to be recorded in the annals of Croy, with gratitude, as the best 
friends of the country. Lachlan Mackintosh, Esq. of Raigmore, 
a native of Croy, having purchased five properties in the parishes 
of Croy, Daviot, and Inverness, containing many hundred acres of 
stinted heath, not capable of affording a scanty meal to as many 
sheep, commenced his extensive improvements, successfully over- 
coming obstacles, which only skill and capital, directed by his own 
characteristic energies, could surmount, and thus in a short time 
converting large tracts of barren moor into fields, yielding most 
luxuriant crops of wheat, oats, and barley, improving and adorning 
what formerly had been a useless waste. About ten years ago, a 
deputation from the Highland Society of Scotland reported, that, 
in bringing land into cultivation, in improving, planting, liming, 
enclosing, draining, and building farm-offices, they consfdered his 
improvements double in amount of those of any other proprietor 
in the country. And if such had been, and still are his exertions 
in improving the physical appearance of the country, much more 
worthy of notice have been his long-continued and disinterested 
exertions for its moral improvement; his name will be asso- 
ciated with every institution in the north, that tends to instruct the 
Ignorant, assist the strugglings of merit, and alleviate the distres- 
ses of humanity. " Non ignota loquor." 

General Sir John Rose of Holm has also contributed much to 



456 



INVKRNESS-SIIIUE. 



the improvement of the parish, by bringing a large waste in the 
western division of the parish into arable land, judiciously divided, 
and substantially enclosed. 

But beyond any other proprietor in the north, Arthur John 
Robertson, Esq. of Inches, is said to have effected the most ex- 
tensive -improvements within the shortest time, havinr brought 
into the highest state of cultivation, no less than 300 acres of 
moor, formerly wet, cold, and useless, the subdivisions being taste- 
fully and judiciously surrounded with beltings of oak, ash, and 
elm. They are soon to be converted into permanent grass parks, 
and, having streams of the purest water introduced to each, will be 
found of great advantage, as there are no grass parks in that 
part of the country. Nor are these improvements confined to 
proprietors,— the farmers, nay, the very cottars begin to make such 
improvements, as their circumstances admit ; and though much re- 
mains to be done, what has been done, will challenge comparison 
with any district in the north of Scotland. 

Amidst so many and so great improvements, we cannot but ob- 
serve with pain, that the beautiful and compact property of Dal- 
cross shoidd remain nearly in the same slovenly state in which it 
was, a hundred years ago. 

Planting. — Few jjlaces in the north seem originally less indebt- 
ed to nature than Croy ; all her bounty consisted in dry stinted 
heath, and all her beauty, in some straggling allers along the banks 
of the Nairn. About 100 years ago, Hugh Rose, the thirteenth 
of that name, planted a considerable extent of moor to the north of 
the castle ; and such was the state of the country and want of roads, 
that the fir plants were carried from Perth in creels, suspended from 
crook saddles. They have grown to a large size, and are of the best 
quality. It appears, however, that, in the same place, there had 
been a plantation of the Caledonian pine, some of which are still 
standing, and of uncommon dimensions, serving for years as land- 
marks to mariners in the Moray Frith. Their lateral branches 
equal, in size, to planted fir of forty years' growth. One lately cut 
down showed the venerable age of 180 years, and there are some 
remaining, apparently much more ancient ; whereas, the fir of Ca- 
nadian origin, now generally planted, seldom lives above 80 years, 
and, in most cases, shows, before that period, symptoms of decay. 
It were well that the seeds of our ancient forest pines were sown, 
as they are more congenial to our soil and climate. About the year 

1776, Mr Davidson of Cantray planted about 300 acres on a useless 

C

and arid waste, not worth 6d. per acre; the proceeds of which, be- 
ing carefully marked from the time of thinning, till the whole was 
sold, about twelve years ago, were found to exceed the simple fee 
of that part of the Cantray property, yielding now about L.1000 
of rent, by nearly double the original purchase price : besides, the 
moor, formerly useless, is now, by the foliage of the trees, con- 
verted into excellent pasture. Such a remarkable fact shows the 
benefit of planting waste ground. That venerable patriot, at va- 
rious periods, planted nearly 1000 acres. Plantations were made 
to much the same extent, and much about the same time, by the 
late Mrs Elizabeth Rose of Kilravock,— a lady remarkable for all 
those graces and accomplishments that adorn the female character, 
as well as for high literary acquirements and practical good sense. 
The proprietors of CuUoden, Holm, and Leys contributed their 
share in beautifying the country by planting ; and lately, the pro- 
prietor of Inches has planted upwards of 400 acres with larch, oak, 
and other kinds of wood. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State.— As formerly stated, it cannot now be de- 
termined when the parishes of Croy and Dalcross were annexed ; 
it is, however, certain, that, in the year 1226, Croy was a parsonage 
on which Moy or Strathdearn depended as vicarage, and cessed 
that year in L. 40 Scots for the entertainment of the Bishop of 
Moray and his court at the annual visitation. In 1 128, the lands 
of Dalcross, with the patronage thereof, were annexed to the 
priory of Urquhart, founded three years before by David I.; and 
in 1343, the vicar of Dalcross, by order of the prior, was to offi- 
ciate in the private chapel of Kilravock. The remains of Dal- 
cross Church are nearly gone ; not so much from the lapse of 
years, as from the blind zeal and incorrigible stupidity of the people 
of that district, who considered the building a relic of Popery ; 
and never was the remark of the philosopher more truly verified 
than by those Anti-popish dilapidators, « Nosmet ipsos noscere 
est difficilhmum." 

In the south of the parish, are the remains of a chapel dedicated 
to St Dorothy, who is mentioned in the Romish calendar as hav- 
ing suffered for the Faith, early in the fifth century. Be that as it 
may, it is highly probable that this chapel was built at the very 
earliest dawn of Christianity in these northern parts of the king- 
dom, while the people retained some lingering veneration for the 
place where their fathers bowed over the cromleac in the Druids' 

XNVEUXESS. G g

Fane, in the centre of which the Christian chapel was erected. 
There were other two chapels, — one at the east end of the parish, 
and the other at Galcantray ; so that few places were better sup- 
plied with the means of instruction. 

The present church was built in 1767, and repaired in 1829; 
seated for 527. It is most inconveniently placed, nearly border- 
ing on the parish of Petty ; but this inconvenience is, in some 
measure, obviated by the circumstance, that though the parish is 
upwards of twenty miles in length, there is not a point within 
it much more than three miles from some parish church. What 
a contrast to its spiritual destitution in 1567, when there was only 
one reader Mr Vause, for this and the extensive parish of Moy, 
whose yearly salary amounted to the sum of 13s. 4d. Sterling  
Since that year until 1823, there have been eight clergymen, the 
average incumbency of each being for thirty-two years. This ac- 
count would be defective, were the name of the Reverend James 
Calder passed without notice. Of this truly good and eminent 
pastor of the parish, it is difficult to determine, whether he was 
most distinguished for his knowledge of the Scriptures, his unre- 
mitting zeal for the glory of God, or his singular success in preach- 
ing the Gospel of Christ. His manners were gentle, his charity un- 
bounded, and his piety fervent. Genius, taste, and judgment di- 
rected his pulpit oratory ; and his powers of persuasion were 
proved by their uncommon success. This highly honoured ser- 
vant of Christ entered into his rest on the 24th of December 1775, 
in the 64th year of his age, and 35th year of his ministry. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, half meal, half barley, of Linlithgow 
bolls measure, according to the fiars prices of the county. Un- 
appropriated teinds amount to L. 240, 4s. lOd. 

Education. — The parish school has been very respectably at- 
tended for many years, where the modern branches of education 
are successfully taught on the most approved intellectual princi- 
ples. The salary of the present teacher is the maximum, and the 
house accommodation reflects credit on all the heritors and factors 
connected with the parish. 

Pour. — Average number of poor on the permanent roll, for the 
years 1835, 1836, and 1837, 37. Average amount of church col- 
lections in their behalf, for these years, L.17, lis.: of other con- 
tributions, L.3, 6s.; of mortifications, mortcloth dues, &amp;c. L.4, 15s.

PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER ERASER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Situation, &amp;fc. — Kirkhill consists of two united pa- 
rishes, called Wardlaw and Farnua. Wardlaw is the name of the 
hill on which the church was built, and is a corruption of the Gae- 
lic Bar-tla, that is, "kindly summit." Farnua or Fearnaie, as it 
is called in Gaelic, is probably derived from the word fearn, sig- 
nifying " allar," because the parish did and still does abound with 
allar trees. The name of the united parishes in Gaelic is Cnoe- 
mhoir, or " Mary's hill." In the neighbourhood, it is called, by 
way of eminence, the Hill : hence the English translation of it, 
Kirkhill. 

This parish is about 8 miles long, and from 1 to 3 miles broad. 
It is bounded on the east and south, by the parish of Inverness ; on 
the west, by the parish of Kiltarlity ; on the north, by the parishes 
of Kilmorack, Urray, and Kilternan, being separated from the 
three last mentioned by the river Beauly and the Moray Frith. For 
four miles it is a narrow strip, on the declivity of a hill, inclining 
to the Moray frith, with a north-west aspect. 

The soil is various. The climate, when compared with many 
places in the same country, is mild and temperate. Old Statis- 
tical Account. 

There is a chalybeate spring in this parish at Auchnagairn ; 
which was once much frequented. 

Hills, Rivers, SfC. — The hills that run along the south-east of 
the parish, are pretty high, and covered with heath. The pasture 
they afford is miserably scanty, the surface being constantly car- 
ried off for fuel. There are some natural woods of birch and al- 
der, and a great extent of plantations. The river Beauly runs along 
the north-west boundary of the parish, for about two or three miles. 
It is navigable at high-water by ships of about 50 tons burden, so

duces abundance of excellent salmon, and several kinds of trouts.

great extent. On the farm of Wester Lovat, there are about 50 
acres, yielding the finest crops of corn, which used, not many years 
ago, to be covered by the tide. This space has been embanked prin- 
cipally at the proprietor's expense; but on the same farm, about ten

acres more have been recovered summer 1840, solely at the te- 
nant's own expense. In several parts of the parish, a great deal 
of moorland also is in course of being brought under cultivation, 
partly at the expense of the proprietor, Lord Lovat, and partly 
at the expense of the different tenants. Also, on the estate of 
Reelick, which is almost altogether now in the proprietor's own 
hands, a great deal of waste land, and what had ever before been 
a perfect morass, has been improved by thorough draining, &amp;c., 
and yields now the finest crops. About L. 1100 have been ex- 
pended, during last season, in improving different portions of this 
property ; and such improvements are still carried on. 

Navigation, — A considerable number of vessels land at two 
places on the Beauly Frith, viz. Fopachy and Wester Lovat ; but 
there is no harbour nor any proper sort of landing-place. These 
import lime and coals, and export timber and grain. The former 
has, of late, been exported to a great extent from this parish. These 
vessels are schooners, brigs, and sloops, 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The whole population belongs to the Esta- 
blished Church, with the exception of six families : and there are 
five families of Roman Catholics. The glebe is ten acres in ex- 
tent, and worth about L. 2 per acre. The manse is at present in 
very good "condition, having been greatly enlarged and entirely 
repaired, about fourteen years ago. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish. The paro- 
chial schoolmaster's salary is L. 30 : his fees may amount to L. 15 
or L. 20. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is about 60. The amount of contributions for their relief is betwixt 
L. 20 and L. 30, all arising from church collections, excepting an, 
occasional donation from proprietors.

PRESBYTERY OF NAIRN, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. JOHN MATHESON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name and Boundaries. — There are many conjectures and tra- 
ditions regarding the etymology of Ardersier, or, as it is variously 
written in the records of the Presbytery of Chanonry, to which 
it was attached till the year 1773, "Ardersuir, Arthursire ;" and 
in a map of Moray, from drawings by Sir Robert Gordon of Stra- 
loch, taken in 1640, it is spelt Ardyrsyir. It is pronounced in 
Gaelic " Ardnasaor," which may signify " the height of the car- 
penter;" tradition having preserved a vague story, that several 
carpenters were drowned in the ferry, during the period that the 
cathedral of Chanonry was being built. Although this derivation 
is plausible, it may reasonably be supposed that the parish had a 
name before this accident befell the craftsmen. So far back as 
the year 1226, in a deed of agreement between the Bishops of 
Moray and Ross, affecting this parish, and transcribed in the 
" Registrum Moraviense," it is written " Ardrosser." This is 
probably derived from the Gaelic Ard, high, Ross, a promontory 
or peninsula, and iar, west ; or the adjunct may be an arbitrary 
termination. This interpretation is in consonance with the fea- 
tures of the parish, which towards its western and northern limits 
exhibits a front of verdant hill, at some points 200 feet above the 
level of the sea. This hill does not extend to the point of land 
which juts into the sea, and which is occupied by Fort- George, 
but terminates by a gradual slope within a mile of it, and suggests 
the idea that the cape had been washed away by some early inun- 
dation. 

The length of the parish, from north-west to south-east, is about 
four miles ; its breadth upwards of two miles. It is bounded on 
the north, by the Moray Frith, whose waters also wash its grace- 

• Drawn up by James Tolmis, Esq. Surgeon, Campbelton. 



ARDERSIER.

fully winding coast on the west ; on the souih, by the parisli of 
Pettie, a narrow cuneiform pendicle of which interposes between 
part of its western face, and the bay of Campbelton ; and on the 
east by the parish of Nairn. Its figure may be compared to that 
of an irregular delta. 

The northern coast, which stretches upwards of three miles along 
the Moray Frith, is flat and sandy ; varied in some localities with 
dunes of blown sand, grown over with Ammophila arundinacea, 
bent, in others with heathy ridges, clumps of furze, and patches 
of gravel. The face of this flat is further diversified by inconsi- 
derable extents of morass along the ridges ; and in some of the 
lowest spots, which are scarcely above the level of the sea, by ex~ 
panses of water hardly deserving the name of lochs, though one of 
them is called Lietchfield loch, the other Lochineghtac. The 
landscape loses somewhat of its wildness towards the eastern boun- 
dary of the parish, where, in the carse, some small farms are culti- 
vated ; not, however, with uniform success, as the drifting sands 
make occasional inroads. On this coast, upwards of a mile east 
from Fort-George, a sand bank, called Whiteness-head, juts in an 
9bhque direction far into the frith, and, being only seen at low- wa- 
ter, renders the navigation dangerous. 

The western coast extends with a curved outline nearly two 
miles along the margin of a picturesque bay, its level and smooth- 
ly pebbled beach forming a commodious bathing-place. 

From the top of the hill already noticed, a plain of cultivated 
land extends backwards towards the confines of Nairn, terminat- 
ing in pasture or heath, and towards the south in a moss whence 
peats are obtained. 

Meteorology. — No regular register of the temperature, nor of 
the pressure of the atmosphere, is kept in the parish. Nor has any 
been kept in the neighbourhood for a sufficient number of years 
to furnish the annual average. At the manse of Pettie, a dis- 
tance of four miles, which is not so exposed as the higher parts 
of this parish, and not so sheltered as the lower grounds around 
Campbelton, and which, in consequence, enjoys the average cli- 
mate of the district, a register of temperature has been kept for the 
last few years from the commencement of seed-time till the end 
of harvest ; and occasionally, if any great deviation from the ave- 
rage temperature of the season took place, during the winter months. 
From that register, I find that during the severe snow-storm in Janu-

In the register from which the above is taken, it is remarked 
that the ash trees before the manse were not so expanded in leaf 
on the 10th June 1840, as on the 28th May 1841 ; also that a 
brood of fully fledged starlings was seen in the church-yard on the 
3th June. 

Among the prognostics of the weather, there is one which is 
pretty generally known, and very frequently correct. When the 
Ross-shire hills are seen very distinctly ni the morning, comino- 
rain is foretold; when a haze or dry mistiness renders these hills 
or any distant object less distinct, a dry day is indicated. Darwin, 
in his Zoonomia, somewhat fancifully explains this atmospheric 
phenomenon on the principle, that the increase of transparency, by 
filling the pores with fluid, is seen by soaking white paper in oil, 
which, frorn an opaque, becomes a transparent body. 

The atmosphere is dry and salubrious. As illustrating in .some 
measure the salubrity of the climate, we may mention the follow- 
ing fact, for which we are indebted to the Rev. Mr Campbell of 
Croy, to whom the parties were well known. About forty years 
ago, there were living in the parish fourteen individuals, ten males, 
and four females, whose respective ages at the time of their death, 
and the last of them lived till about six years ago, were as fol- 
lows : one 106 years, one 104, one 103; these three were Chel- 
sea pensioners; one 100, two 98, one 96, two 94, one 92, two, 
90, and two 88. The rains of spring and autumn readily perco- 
late through the shingly and porous subsoil which characterizes 
the lower parts of the parish, between which and the higher part 
there is a well-marked climatic difference. While the upper part

is exposed to storms from the east and north, the village of Camp- 
belton, from the shelter of the line of hill which rises behind it 
like a screen, enjoys an almost perfect immunity. On the 26th 
June 1826, the thermometer indicated 84° in the village, while 
on the height, from the fanning elfect of a light sea breeze, it did 
not exceed 82°. In cold weather, the difference is more marked. 
The weather in spring is rather variable ; one day, or a succession 
of days, may simulate the genial warmth of summer, and be 
abruptly followed by the chilling rigour of winter. We have no 
endemic disease. As the prevalent distempers of the district, 
rheumatism, erysipelas, and catarrhal affections may be instanced. 
In estimating the influences which act upon organized beings in 
the production or modification of disease, other agencies than at- 
mospheric or miasmatic must be taken into account. Thus, the 
vicissitudes of the circulation produced by hard labour and expo- 
sure to cold, irregular and innutrient meals, and the use of ardent 
spirits, operate in producing disease, or begetting a suscepti- 
bility to it. Erysipelas is certainly a common affection in the dis- 
trict. All cutaneous diseases, however, not even excepting the 
national opprobrium, are made to personate it by the indiscrimi- 
nating rustics. Derangement of the functions of the skin, from 
inattention to ablution, may contribute to the frequency of this ex- 
anthem. 

Hydrography. — The Moray Frith washes the northern coast of 
the parish, and an extension of it, which, to the south of Fort- 
George, acquires the name of the Frith of Beauly, forms a bay on 
the western shore, which, from the bold and picturesque contour 
of the hills on the opposite coast of Ross-shire, presents a beauti-. 
ful landscape. From the hill behind Campbelton, there issues in 
a continuous jet, a strongly chalybeate spring, which has deserved- 
ly acquired a high character as a tonic, and is frequented by ner- 
vous, dyspeptic, and cachectic invalids. 

Geology. — There is not an exposed rock in the parish. Two 
or three small- sized boulders of gneiss occur within the high water- 
mark. The terrace or line of hill which skirts the western and 
northern coasts, shows its alluvial origin from the alternate strata 
of sand and clay observable in exposed sections. No sea shells have 
been found in this ridge. Along the coast there are manifest im- 
pressions of geological changes. On the west, the sea has, at a 
remote period, made considerable encroachments. Peat is found 
several hundred yards within high-water mark, under a layer of 



466 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



sand of about a foot in thickness. From the agencyof successive tides 
and currents, this encroachment is slowly becoming less, as is evi- 
denced by the beach of loose shingle thrown up in the course of ages, 
which extends along the coast for nearly tw 0 miles, and which is in 
parts upwards of a quarter of a mile in breadth. That the causes 
which produced this marine deposit are still in operation, is known 
by the fact that, within the last twenty years, the access to the pier 
at Fort- George has been completely blocked up by a barrier of 
this shingly debris. The northern coast bears marks of extensive 
inundation. Upwards of a mile inland from the present flood- 
mark are distinctly visible two beaches of shingle or water-worn 
pebbles, parallel to each other in their winding outline, and dis- 
tant from each other only a few yards. Parts of the reclaimed 
land have been, time immemorial, under tillage. If the inundation 
happened within the historical sera, it was probably in the year 
1097, when we are told by Boethius, Buchanan, and other histo- 
rians, that the Goodwin estate was overwhelmed by sand, and the 
lands of Moray desolated by an inundation of the German Ocean. 

In the banks of the rill which divides Ardersier from Fleming- 
ton, and which has a channel of some depth, logs of black oak, 
lying horizontally, are seen at depths varying from three to five 
feet below the surface level. At many points the sides and bot- 
tom of the channel present extensive patches of bog-iron ore. 

Zoology. — Quails have been frequently shot in the parish, and 
starlings have hatched young broods in the neighbourhood. In 
the winter months, the coast is frequented by flocks of aquatic 
fowl. Barnacle, sheldrake, teal, and widgeon are the frequent 
.prey of sportsmen. And some of the rarer species, as the red- 
breasted merganser [Mergus serrate', have been shot in the bay. 
Of shell-fish, the cockle {Cardium edule, which abounds in the 
sea sands, deserves notice. They are gathered in quantities by 
the fisher girls, and conveyed to the Inverness market ; and they 
aff'ord a savoury variety to the humble repast of the poorer classes, 
whose children are sent to collect them. Muscles and periwin- 
kles are also common on the coast. 

Botany. — The flora of the parish does not comprehend any very 
rare species of plants. The maiden-pink {Dianthus deltoides 

 At one locality, some liuiidred yards from the-shore, and about eighteen inches 
beneath the surface of the sea sands, a mass of sandstone with a mixture of carbonate 
of lime, and enclosing innumerable fossil shells, all of existing species, is discoverable. 
The shells seem to be in different stages of fossilization, the texture of the stone be- 
ing softer near the surface.

has a locality on Cromal mount, as has likewise the Myosotis co- 
linn, a plant rare in this neighbourhood. That magnificent aqua- 
tic, the white water lily, {Nijmphcea alba, grows in gorgeous pro- 
fusion in Lochineghtac. The surface of this miniature lake is li- 
terally obscured by the plentiful display of this splendid flower. 
Of the other plants found in the parish, the following, as not be- 
ing very generally distributed, may be mentioned : 

Agiimonia eupatoria Erythraea littoralis Reseda luteola 

Astragalus hypoglottis Fumaria capreolata Rhinanthus major 

Cakile maritimum Hyacinthus nonscriptus Senecio visoosus 

Centaurea scabiosa Knautia arvensis _ Solidago virgaurea 
Chenopodium maritimum Lithosperraum maritimum Saxifraga granulata 

Drosera Anglica Malva rotundifolia Vicia sylvatica. 

Echium vulgare Primula vulgaris 

The ErythrcBa littoralis \s much extolled by the country people 
as a tonic ; it is rather a pleasant bitter. The shores abound in 
marine vegetation. Many species of the order Algce, mixed with 
Zostera, are driven ashore in great quantities by the surge, and 
are readily gathered and used as manure. Dulse [Halymenia pal- 
mata is found on the north coast; and laver {Ulva umbilicalis 
and Ulva lactuca is likewise found on the black scalp. It is 
known by the people as slake kail, and is considered, when dres- 
sed, good in consumption and scrofula. From the fact that io- 
dine is obtained from this class of sea-weeds, this opinion is not 
unfounded. Irrespective of its sanative virtues, the laver is sought 
after as a delicacy. Another of the Jlyce, the Carragheen moss, 
is found on the shore, and is an economical substitute for isin- 
glass. The Cynosurus cristatus is very common in pastures and 
waste places. We have seen a bonnet made of this grass, in ap- 
pearance and quality much resembling the Leghorn or Tuscan, 
which was plaited under the direction of a lady at Fort- George. 
It is called in Ireland, Traleen grass, 

11. — Civil History. 
Of the early history of the parish not much is known. A con- 
siderable part of Ardersier belonged to the diocese of Ross. 
Among the documents in Cawdor Castle is a disposition dated 
1574, " of the lands and barony of Ardersier, fishings of salmon, 
and other fishings whatsoever ; Over Brouster House and Nether 
Brouster House, with their crofts and pertinents, and the croft 
commonly called Fisher's. croft, by Robert Lesly, brother of Da- 
vid, Bishop of Ross, and commendator of the monastery of Cam- 
buskenneth, with consent of the Dean and Chapter of Ross, in fa- 
vour of John Campbell of Calder," now Cawdor. Earl Caw-

dor still pays L. 67 Scots to the crown, as bishop's rent. " The 
Knights-Templar had some lands in Ardersier, and a jurisdiction 
of regality." " This order came to Scotland in the reign of 
David I., who endowed it with many lands, uncommon privileges, 
and valuable exemptions; and these were all confirmed by successive 
kings, and allowed by several popes. Sir James Sandilands, who 
was the lastpreceptor of this order, obtained, by a grant from Queen 
Mary in 1563, the remaining estates of his order, as a temporal 
barony, on paying 10,000 crowns. Sir James died as Lord Tor- 
phichen in 1618.f This explains how Lord Torphichen became 
possessed of lands in this parish. These lands were sold by Lord 
Torphichen to Mr Thomas Rollock, advocate; and by thelattergen- 
tleman disponed to John Campbell, younger ofCalder, by deed dat- 
ed 13th August 1626, as " the temple lands of Ardersier, the tem- 
ple-lands of Overcruick and Overbank of Ardersier, lying in the dio- 
cese of Ross and sheriffdom of Inverness." " In 1623, John Dow 
Campbell of Calder, hadall his lands in the north, by a charter under 
the'Great Seal, erected into a barony, called the Burgh of Camp- 
belton, with power to create bailies, constables, sergeants, and other 
officers ; liberty to have a town-house, and a market cross, a weekly 
market on Wednesday, — and a fair to begin on July 15th, and to 
hold eight days, and that all infeftments may betaken at the Cas- 
tle of Calder." 

We find in Pitcairn's Criminal Trials of Scotland, that this 
parish was honoured in 1508 by the transit of King James IV. in 
one of his pilgrimages to the shrine of St Duthoc at Tain, which 
was then held in particular sanctity. Among the items of expense 
on this journey are the following : " October 20, Item, to the 
freiris of Ardoseir 13s." " Item, to Robert Mertoune, for passing 
ower the water with the goshawk, 10s." 

Upwards of two hundred years ago, the Thane of Calder, in 
proceeding from Ardersier homewards with his servant, fell from 
his horse at Druimadeobhan, and instantly expired. The agency 
of apoplexy, or affections of the heart, was then unknown, and the 
worthy Thane's death was ascribed to witchcraft. A commission 
was given to search for the perpetrator of the foul deed, and sus- 
picion fell on a withered old woman in the carse, " who looked not 
like an inhabitant of the earth " The necessary marks were dis-

covered, conviction followed, and the poor creature was burned at 
a stake at a place called the Paddock. 

At no very remote period, a belief in fairies and their gambols 
existed to a degree beyond the credence of the present age. We 
would not vouch that some lurking dread of these airy spirits, who 
"mislead night wanderers, and bootless make the breathless house- 
wife churn," is not still harboured by some bustling matrons. 
About 1730, according to tradition, a man of the name of Munro 
had a sickly atrophied child, which he and his neighbours consi- 
dered to be a changeling substituted by the fairies at an unguarded 
moment in the place of his own. There is a conical knoll in the 
carse, called Tom Eanraic or Henry's knoll, which was famed as 
the scene of the moonlight revels of these elves. It was believed 
that if the supposed changeling were left overnight on this hillock, 
the real child would be found in its stead in the morning. The in- 
fatuated parent subjected his drooping and attenuated offspring to 
this ordeal, and in the morning found it a corpse. 

Eminent Men. — The late Dr John Mackintosh, Lecturer on the 
Theory and Practice of Physic in Edinburgh, and author of two 
volumes on the " Pathology and Practice of Physic," and of a mo- 
nograph on " Puerperal Fever," received the rudiments of his 
education in this parish. Major Pryse Gordon, author of " Per- 
sonal Memoirs and Reminiscences," and a sketch of " Holland 
and Belgium," in two volumes, was born in the manse, — his fa- 
ther, the Rev. Harry Gordon, being then pastor of the parish. 
This gentleman, who is in his 80th year, lived in habits of in- 
timacy with Professor Person, Dr Burney, Mr John Kemble, and 
Monk Lewis. Major Robert Calder Campbell, E. L C. S., son of 
the late Rev. P. Campbell, is a native of the parish. Major Camp- 
bell is the author of Lays from the East," and the " Palmer's 
last Lesson," and is an admired contributor to the " Annuals." 
With considerable poetical talents, he combines a cultivated taste 
for music, and has published some sets of quadrilles. 

In the annals of a parish which possesses such a fortification as 
Fort-George, where breathes all " the pomp and circumstance of 
war," it might be expected that the names of some distinguished 
officers should appear. Some of the following gentlemen were 
born in the parish ; the others received their early education in the 
school of Campbelton ; the late Admiral Sir Patrick Campbell, 
K. C.B., and his brother. General Sir Colin Campbell, Governor of 
Ceylon ; the late General Sir Alexander Caldwell, E. I. C. S. ; 



INVEUNESS-SHIUE. 



Colonel Sir Alexander Anderson, C. B. ; Lieutenant- Colonel 
Duncan Macpherson, and his brother, the late Captain George 
Macpherson, R. N. 

The whole parish belongs to the Earl of Cawdor, with the ex- 
ception of the precinct of the fort, purchased by Government 
about 1746. 

Parochial Registers.— earliest entry is in June 1719; they 
are regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — On the heath near the junction of the parish of 
Nairn is an obelisk or " standing stone," about 6 feet in height, 
called the Kebbock-stone, erected, according to tradition, over the 
grave of a chief who fell in a skirmish, the inglorious cause of 
which originated in a dispute about a cheese. Another tradition is, 
that it marks a spot where the Danes were repulsed. The late 
Mr Nimmo of the Inverness Academy, thought the stone had 
been placed to mark the boundary between the counties of Inver- 
ness and Nairn. 

At Dalyards there were in the beginning of last century fragments 
of the ruins of a large building, which tradition reports to have 
belonged to the Knights- Templar. Whether the building was 
a religious house or a fortalice is uncertain ; probably the latter, 
as the enterprizeof agriculture has not yet succeeded in obliterating 
traces of the fosse with which it was surrounded. Dalyards is 
marked in Gordon of Straloch's map of Moray 1640, though a 
little out of place. It is now a cultivated field, 

" And, after length of years, no stones betray ■ 
The place, where once the very ruins lay." 

There was a Druid circle at Achnuallan, but the distance from 
a quarry, and the expense of carrying building materials, prompted 
its demolition many years ago. A horn filled with silver coins 
was dug up near this circle forty years ago, but no correct infor- 
mation is preserved of their nation or date. 

On the line of hill behind Campbelton, there is a circular 
mount, elevated about 20 feet above the surface level of the ridge, 
and commanding from its summit a most extensive view, which 
embraces parts of seven or eight counties. This mount is called 
in Gaelic, Cromal or Tom Mhoit. It is corruptly Anglicised into 
Cromwell's Mount. In the " Memorabilia of Inverness" it is 
called Cromal, and is included among the British hill-forts of the 
county. It is surrounded at the top by a rampart about five feet 
high, which, from the nature of the locality, is of clay and earth.

In its western aspect, the wall is nearly straight; the area is circu- 
lar. Its circumference is about 120 yards. The approach to the 
fort was from the south-east. The earthen mound which led to 
it, has been long ago carried away ; the agricultural eye, which di- 
rected its abduction, seeing compost in every thing. The work 
of demolition did not end here, for with the raised approach was 
excavated a slight section of the rampart. Whilst this does not 
materially injure the venerable pile, it has exposed to view a horizon- 
tal layer of small loose stones, on a level with the area within. At 
some points these stones exhibit marks of calcination or decompo- 
sition, and fragments of charred wood are found in the superin- 
cumbent earth. 

There were, some years ago, on the heath of Balnagown, two 
parallel lines of circular earthen mounds ; each tumulus in the 
rear line, covering the opening between two tumuli in the front 
line, and the distance such that an enemy could not pass between 
any two, or break the line with impunity ; being within a dart's 
throw of each other. Many of these fortlets or enclosures have 
been carried away as compost by the small farmers ; and others 
have been destroyed or mutilated by the line of road, which passes 
through the encampment, but several of them still remain. It is 
considered of Danish origin. Danish stone-axes have been found 
in the neighbourhood. 

" At Ardersier, which is situated on the southern shore of the 
Varar, twenty-four miles west, south-west from Ptoroton Burgh- 
head, there were dug up, more than twenty-five years ago, a very 
curious Roman sword and the head of a spear." Roy's Military 
Antiquities, Vol, i. p. 88. 

Modern Buildings, — Fort- George, a model of a fortress, occu- 
pies the limit of the peninsula, called Ardersier Point, The fol- 
lowing description of it, from « Anderson's Guide to the High- 
lands," we adopt, on account of its concise correctness : " It is an 
irregular polygon, with six bastions, mounting 18 twenty-four, 
25 eighteen, 22 twelve, and 4 six pounders, and 4 thirteen-inch 
mortars. It was founded in 1748, under the direction of General 
Skinner, who continued director of engineers in Scotland till 1757. 
The land-front is defended by a ditch, covert way, and glacis, two 
lunettes and a raveline mounting 8 twelve-pounders. The north 
and south curtains are casemated, each containing 27 bomb-proof 
apartments. The grand magazine is bomb-proof, and will hold 
2474 barrels of gunpowder. The staff buildings lie towards the

land-front, and are occupied by the governor's, lieutenant governor's, 
engineer officer's and chaplain's quarters; and also by the artil- 
lery barracks. The barracks are constructed for 2500 troops. 
The fort is also provided with a chapel, brew-house, bake-house, 
and inn, and is supplied with water from eight pump-wells. The 
drawbridges and main approach form an elegant and imposing 
piece of workmanship." The staff-officers have gardens on the 
common. A garrison library has lately been- established by go- 
vernment, to which the soldiers have access. At the ferry of Fort- 
George, which connects the eastern part of Inverness with Ross, 
and the northern counties, the steamers from London and Leith to 
Inverness land and take in passengers and goods. 

III. — Population. 
A century ago Ardersier was so thinly peopled that it was called 
the parish of six." 

Dr Webster's return of the population amounted to 428 
By the census of the present year it is - 1477 
This number includes the garrison. 
Yearly average of births for the last seven years, 22 
marriages, - - 12 

No register of deaths is kept. 

There are two fatuous, one insane, and one blind person in the 
parish. 

Langvage. — The language generally spoken in the village, which 
contains three-fourths of the population of the parish, is English. 
In the interior, Gaelic prevails. But, from recent changes in the 
lessees of farms, and from the new occupants possessing little of 
the Celtic character, it may be fairly stated, that the Gaelic has 
lost, and is losing ground. It is a curious circumstance that, from 
the year 1757 to 1781, during the ministrations of two incumbents, 
no Gaelic was preached in the parish. On the ordination of the 
Rev. P. Campbell, in the latter year, it was requested by the 
people, and agreed to by him, that he should exhort them in the 
Gaelic language. 

Of the prevailing popular customs, one may be mentioned, to 
which the pencil of Wilkie has given a kind, of classical celebrity 
we allude to penny weddings. These are falling into desue- 
tude, except among the fishers — a class of people who possess 
many habits and many superstitious observances quite peculiar to 
themselves. They never intermarry out of their own tribes, and 
there is an obvious reason for this on the part of the young men, 
as no other females would undertake the laborious out-of-door oc- 



ARDERSIER. 



cupations to which their wives are subjected. They carry in creels 
on their back to great distances immense loads of fish ; and they 
carry their husbands to and from their boats, when, from the state 
of the tide, they cannot get in or out dry-shod. This latter duty 
influences the fashion of the costume of the females, which, as re- 
gards their lower garments, is of peculiar brevity. The women 
make the nets and bait the lines, and the fishermen, when not em- 
ployed on the vasty deep, do little else than chew tobacco. They 
still keep up the system of inviting the surrounding country to their 
weddings ; and although they are numerously attended, the com- 
pany is not so select as it was wont to be in the olden time, when 
the synod of Moray in 1640 deemed it necessary to record a mi- 
nute forbidding " ministers or their wives to haunt penny bridals." 
The fishers marry at an early age, and generally before they ac- 
quire the means of furnishing a house even with the necessary ar- 
ticles. To compensate in some measure for the deficiency, the 
custom of thigging, as it is called, is adopted by the young wife a 
few days after marriage. She, accompanied by her bride's-maid, 
visits her neighbours and friends, and they each present her with 
some little article of house-plenishing, generally a piece of earthen- 
ware, usage permitting the visitor to choose what article she pleases. 

From the level nature of the ground between Campbelton and 
Fort-George, long-bowls is a favourite game in the winter season. 
Shooting at the popinjay, which is modernized into a target, is also 
a popular amusement about the Christmas holidays. The best 
marksman wins the prize, generally some agricultural implement. 
Each competitor, before firing, pays a certain sum to the exposer 
of the prize, and the rivalry is pursued till the fixed value is rea- 
lized. 

The habits of the people, as regards personal cleanliness, are 
certainly improved within the last few years. Even the fishermen, 
who, for the purpose of smoking their haddocks, and converting 
them into speldings, had their fire-places in the middle of the 
room, liberally giving unconstrained freedom to the smoke, are now 
adopting the luxury of chimneys. Their ancient attachment to 
the hog-stye and dunghill, which usually blockaded the entrance 
to their houses, if, indeed, these were not sheltered by the same 
roof, has received a withering chill ; chiefly from the appearance 
a few years ago of cholera among them, and from the exertions of 
the Board of Health in efl'ecting a drainage of the stagnant pools, 
and in removing all nuisances.

With regard lo dress, the niiiuitc of the synod of Moray, dated 
]624, " discharging ministers within the bounds of the Inverness 
presbytery from conning to their meetings of presbytery in bonnets 
and plaids," would not now apply to the people, far less to the 
clergymen. It is true, the broad flat bonnet worn by the Moray 
farmer of last century may still be seen on old men ; and the 
Glengarry bonnet on young men and boys. But the latter, as 
well as the sprinkling of tartan frocks and jackets among children, 
and the showy tartan waistcoats worn by young men, are the pro- 
duct of a more modern mania for the Celtic costume. It is pleas- 
ing to see the endless variety of clan and fancy tartans displayed 
in the cloaks and shawls of females. 

In estimating the character of the people, it will be necessary 
to divide them into three classes — first, the fishers, generally speak- 
ing, a correct and orderly set of people, seldom outraging the mo- 
ral duties ; rarely associating with persons out of their own voca- 
tion, and generally possessing the necessaries of life in abundance. 
It must, however, be added,'that they do not appreciate the advanta- 
ges of education. Next, the Chelsea pensioners, many of whom are 
located in the parish, having married natives when stationed with 
their regimeqts in the Fort, and having been swayed by female influ- 
ence in°the choice of alocal habitation. This class, though there are 
many honourable exceptions, is rather improvident and intemperate. 
The third class comprehends the peasantry and mechanics. From 
the example of military habits, instances of dissipation were not un- 
common a short time ago in this class. But a happy change has been 
produced ; the temperance principle has been pretty widely adopt- 
ed, and the external improvement is already very manifest. Among 
the seniors of this class, there are some bright examples of primi- 
tive simplicity and sterling worth. 

IV. — Industry. 
J griculture.— There are about 1434 imperial acres in cultiva- 
tion'; 1 815 in pasture and heath, of which last 64 acres have been 
lately planted with fir and larch by the proprietor, Earl Cawdor, 
and preparations are in progress for extending the plantation con- 
siderably. In the Ordnance lands in the neighbourhood of the 
fort, there are 216 acres of gravel and sand, rendered waste by 

early inundation.  i i 

The average rent of arable land per acre is about 15s. 6d. ; the

rent varies from L, 2, 2s. to 10s., according to quality and vici- 
nity to Campbelton, In the immediate neighbourhood of the vil- 
lage, lands pay L. 3 per acre. 

Farms are held on leases of nineteen years, except the village 
lands, which are held at will ; the inhabitants occupying them as 
a convenience. 

Concerning the state of husbandry and improvement, the Rev. 
Mr Campbell of Croy, a native of the parish, to whom we are in- 
debted for several facts connected with its early history, writes as 
follows:—" Previous to the year 1780, there was scarcely an in- 
closure in the parish. The mode of farming was wretched in the 
extreme. The land was scourged by a succession of white crops; 
then allowed, with its accumulated weeds, to rest for years, when 
it again underwent the same trying process. The crops were of 
the poorest description, and many of the cattle, from want of pro- 
vender, died in the spring. This ignorance and sloth of the far- 
mers was of some benefit to the poorer classes. The fields were 
productive in nettles, wild spinach, wild mustard, and mugwort, of 
which weeds the poor people made a wholesome and savoury mess 
on which they mostly subsisted during the summer; their only 
approaching relief being a small patch of bear, generally ripe 
about the 1st of August. About this time, Mr Macpherson en- 
tered upon the largest farm in the parish. Of this gentleman it 
may be truly said, that, so long as warm benevolence of heart, dis- 
interested friendship, and the most conscientious discharge of the 
-all-social duties are held in esteem, his name and memory will 
long be dear to the people of the parish. Mr Macpherson, know- 
ing the capabilities of the soil, commenced on the most approv- 
ed system of husbandry then known in the north, and in a short 
time, not only the appearance, but the very constitution of the 
farm was changed. The contrast between the crops under the 
new and old systems was so apparent, that the small farmers soon 
followed the example of their benefector ; so that now, and for se- 
veral years, the poorest tenants labour their ground after the most 
approved manner. Before that time, potatoes were planted in lazv 
beds, or dibbled in like cabbages. It ought to be recorded that 
Mr Mathews, who farmed the Ordnance ground, was the first who 
planted potatoes with the plough in this part of the kingdom." 
Fisheries.— There are two stake-nets for the capture of salmon 

that 1;nl'5v°'Q'tf'u'"'''"P™ Pl' '""y mentioned, 

that, since tlie year 1800, the Earl of Cawdor's rental has increased 150 per cent.

on the coast. The rents together amount to L, 60, Herring fish- 
ing is carried on, every season, by the Campbekon fidiermen. 
Eleven boats, each of about twelve tons register, have this summer 
sailed for the fishing stations at Helmsdale and Burgh-head. In 
a successful season, it is a source of considerable profit ; each boat 
taking not unfrequently 200 crans or barrels in five or six weeks. 
For each cran they are paid from 10s. to 13s. In the white fish- 
ing, these fishermen likewise embark ; and after supplying the pa- 
rish with haddock, cod-fish, skate, whiting, flounders, and occa- 
sionally turbot, halibut, and sole, they carry the surplus to the In- 
verness market. For short voyages along the coast in the summer 
time, the fishermen have sharp-built and fast-sailing yawls. By 
their industry, many of these men have been enabled to save some 
money ; but the hazardous nature of their calling, renders highly 
commendable their present intention of establishing, in conjunction 
with the fishers of Pettie, a branch of the " Shipwrecked Fisher- 
men and Mariner's Society." 

Navigation. — Three vessels, of about 100 tons burthen each, 
which are employed in the Sunderland trade, belong to a family 
in the village. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Campbelton is the only village and market-town in the parish. 
Inverness is distant ten miles, and Nairn seven miles. The population 
of Campbelton proper, according to the census of the present year, 
is 730 ; of the back-street, which, though belonging to the pa- 
rish of Pettie, is dove-tailed and connected with it in civil and mu- 
nicipal interests, 228,— making in all 958. There is a post-office 
in the village, and, besides the mail, two stage-coaches pass daily 
to the south and north. The great post-road from Inverness to 
Aberdeen passes through the village, as does also the military road 
from Fort- George to Perth, projected by General Wade, and be- 
gun inl753. Ab outtwenty-four feuars in Campbelton possess 
votes in the election of a Member of Parliament for the county, and 
the number of qualifications may be increased. The County Con- 
stabulary Committee have lately established a policeman ; and the 
county Prison-Board have, at a recent meeting, come to the resolu- 
tion of erecting a lock-up-house. A small debt court is held every 
month. There is no harbour. This is a great desideratum, as, 
independently of the usual traffic in coals and lime, the beach is 
much frequented as a shipping place for pit-props and other tim- 
ber from adjacent properties ; as well as for grain from the sur-

rounding country. A harbour would be a great boon to the fisher- 
men of the village, a very industrious class of people, who, from 
their remoteness from a pier, are precluded from participating in 
the gratuities given by the Fishery Board to others of their voca- 
tion resident within a mile of a harbour. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Although Ardersier be now, and very na- 
turally, comprehended within the bounds of the provincial synod of 
Moray, yet, for some years even subsequent to the Revolution, it 
was connected with the synod of Ross. Previous to the Reforma- 
tion, it had belonged to the diocese of Ross. In what manner it 
came to be claimed by the Bishop of Ross, we do not know. 
Perhaps, previous to the irruption of the sea at Fort- George, 
part of Ardersier might have been geographically more connected 
with Ross than with Moray : Be this as it may, we find that both 
the bishops laid claim to the parish, as pertaining to their respec- 
tive sees : and that it was necessary, in 1226, to terminate the 
dispute by a formal arrangement, according to which the Bishop 
of Moray agrees to relinquish his pretensions to Ardersier, and 
the Bishop of Ross, to renounce claims which he had advanced to 
Kiltarlity, as part of the diocese of Ross. In the chartulary of 
Moray, Charter 75, we have the formal composition of their dif- 
ferences as to these parishes, and the engagement of the Bishop 
of Ross to pay to the cathedral of Elgin " unam petram cerse, 
pro confraternitate et orationibus et aliis beneficiis ibidem faciendis 
habenda." Among the witnesses to this -agreement is the name 
of Mauritius, who combined in his own person the offices of 
" canon of Rosmarkyn, and parson of Ardrosser." Ardersier was 
the seat of the sub-dean of Ross. We find that, after the Refor- 
majion, it was successively attached to the presbyteries of Ross, 
Dingwall, and Chanonry, till the year 1707, when it was con- 
nected with the Presbytery of Forres, or the Presbytery of Inver- 
ness, which about this period were divided into two presbyteries 
while they had been previously united. In 1711, the records of 
Chanonry state that Ardersier is now of this date reunited to 
Chanonry. In 1773, Ardersier was, by an act of Assembly, dis- 
joined from Chanonry, to make part of the newly erected Presby- 
tery of Nairn, within the synod of Moray, to which it has since 
continued to be connected. 

The earliest notice of the incumbents of this parish which we 
have been able to obtain, is the following, which occurs under the 
head " Ministers in Ross" — in the Register of ministers, exhorters,

Mr A. S. Allan, Kincardine, to whom we are indebted for the ; 
preceding notice, mentions that in the Advocates' Library, there is ' 
an MS.roll of the names of the ministers in the Kirk in Scotland,  
who refused to submit to Prelacy, and continued stedfast in own- 
ing Presbyterian Government after the re-establishment of Epis- 
copacy in 1661-1662, in which the name of Mr John M'Culloch J 
at Ardersire occurs. 

In 1686, Mr John Dallas was Dean of Ross, and parson of Ar- ' 
thursire, as appears from a mortification by the Bishop, Dean, 
and Chapter of Ross, given in General Hutton's MS. collection 
in the Advocates' Library. ; 

From another MS. in the same Ubrary, entitled " Ane account 
of the names of the ministers and parishes in the several synods 
and presbyteries of Scotland, at and since the late Revolution, 
1689, &amp;c." written in 1711 or 1712, we have this extract: , 

" Presbytery of Chanonry, Arthursire, Mr John Dallas, Dean 
of Ross, outed and deprived by the return of Mr John M'KuUoch, I 
late Presbyterian minister, 1697, and upon Mr M'KuUoch's leav- 
ing'the place, Mr Dallas intruded again, and remained till he died. 
Mr Lachlan M'Bean, also Episcopal incumbent, intruded then 
— afterwards received by the commission, and now 1711 or 
1712 deposed for immorality." 

Mr M'Bean had been previously settled in 1688, as Episcopal 
minister of Calder, but demitted that charge in 1698, and went 
to Ardersier as above. He was the last Episcopal incumbent of 
the parish, and his continuance as such was connived at both in - 
Calder and Ardersier. 

Mr Hugh Campbell, ordained in 1707, translated to Kiltearn 
in 1708. In the records of the Presbytery of Chanonry is a mi- 4| 
nute bearing that the Presbytery, after some trouble with the Laird 
of Calder, the sole heritor, of this date September 1713, ordained 
Mr Daniel Beaton minister. In 1 7 17, Mr Beaton complained that 




AttDEttSIEll.

the slipend being only two clialders of vicinal, and some small vi- 
caraoe tithes, worth 2G pounds Scots, at most, and two pounds Scots, 
and no orass, he could not live on this. The same year he was 
translated to Rosskeen. 

Alexander Falconer, ordained in 1718. In the Chanonry re- 
cords are notices of sundry collections made during Mr Falconer's 
incumbency ; as for the distressed Protestants of Lithuania ; for 
the French Protestants ; for the Scots congregation in New York ; 
for a bridge over the river Dee, by order of the General Assem- 
bly; for the piers at BanfFand Aberbrqthick. In 1728, Gray of 
Skiboll, and Gordon of Garty, were guilty of a violent outrage, 
and were made to submit to public discipline in the church of 
Ardersier, and to pay a fine of L.30. This year Mr Falconer was 
translated to Ferrintosh. 

Duncaii Macintosh ordained 1729, died in 1736. 

James Calder ordained 1737. In 1741, Mr Calder refused an 
earnest call to Inverness. In 1747, he had a call from Kilmuir- 
Wester, and another from Croy ; he accepted the latter. On one 
of these occasions, he declines the call on the ground of the inabi- 
lity of the minister of Sgiv an Icth dusan, the parish of the half- 
dozen, to discharge the duties of a large parish. 

The Laird of Calder presented Mr William Barron, minister 
- of Ardclach, to Ardersier, but the Presbytery of Forres refused 
to translate him. In 1749, he presented Mr Daniel Brodie. In 
1751, the glebe of Ardersier seems to have been removed on ac- 
count of the grounds required for the Fort. The following year 
Mr Brodie is translated to Calder, on which occasion the laird 
wishes to have Ardersier united to Calder,; but the Presbytery re- 
fuse their consent to the proposed union of the charges. It was 
probably from the delay occasioned by the attempt to unite these 
parishes, that no minister was settled in Ardersier till 1757, when 
Ir Harry Gordon was ordained to the charge. The stipend at 
this period hardly amounted to L.lOO a-year, as we are told by 
Major Pryse Gordon, son of the incumbent, in his Personal Me 
moirs and Reminiscences; but Mr Gordon was also chaplain to 
the neighbouring garrison, for which he received a further remu- 
neration of 15s. per week. Mr Gordon was succeeded in 1764 
by Mr Walter Morison, the " Aristophanes of the North," or 
" the Witty Walter." Anecdotes of his wit, humour, and face- 
tiousness, are still current in the district. From the records of 
the Presbytery of Nairn, of date May 13th 1777, we give the fol- 
ing extract: «• There was laid before the Presbytery a petition to 



480 



INVERNESS-SHIIlIv 



the Committee for managing the Royal Bounty, signed the Lt.- 
Ciovernor, and principal inliabitants of Fort- George, craving that 
the Committee would grant a proper salary to Mr Walter Mori- 
son, mmister of Ardersier, for encouraging him to preach in the 
Fort every Sabbath, at an hour not interfering with his parish kirk, 
which petition the Presbytery did highly approve, and did, and 
do hereby recommend it to the serious consideration of the Com- 
mittee." We quote this minute, to show the activity evinced in 
former times, in regard to the provision for a minister or chaplain 
in the Fort. At the union of Scotland with England, it was sti- 
pulated that chaplains should be maintained in the three castles 
of Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dumbarton. It being considered un- 
necessary to continue the chaplaincy at Dumbarton, this situation 
was some years ago abolished. But in order to fulfil the act of 
Union in spirit, if not in letter, the chaplaincy of Fort-George 
was substituted in its room. And yet this chaplaincy has been 
dealt with, as if, in maintaining it, a boon to which they had no 
claim, was conferred on the garrison. We observe the Presbytery 
of Edinburgh taking steps, in order to give the chaplain of that 
castle a seat in the Presbytery. But the Presbytery of Nairn 
seems to overlook the fact that the chaplain of Fort-George has 
an equal title to a seat in the Presbytery of Nairn. The situation 
of chaplain is a very important one, and should have an adequate 
provision, instead of the present pittance allowed by Government. 
Mr Pryse Campbell succeeded Mr- Morison, as appears by the 
following extract from the Presbytery of Nairn records of date 
6th March 1781 : " The moderator asked the people if they had 
any objection to the pregentee ; they replied they had none, as he 
agreed to preach in Erse." 

In December 1839, Mr John Matheson was ordained assistant 
and successor to Mr Campbell. In February 1840, Mr Camp- 
bell died at the advanced age of 86. He was distinguished for 
cheerfulness of disposition, liveliness of imagination, and disinte- 
rested benevolence. 

The parish church is situafed in the eastern and interior part 
of the parish, and is convenient for the bulk of the population, 
three-fourths of which reside in Campbelton, about a mile distant. 
It was finished in 1802, and is in a good state of repair. It affords 
accommodation for upwards of 500. No seat rents are now paya- 
ble. The manse, which is commodious and modern, was built in 
1 828. The glebe extends to 17 acres arable, and about five of pas- 
ture. It is worth about L. 25. The amount of stipend paid by 



AllDERSIER, 



481 



Earl Cawdor, is L. 117, 15s. 7d., the remainder, raising the amount 
to L. 150, is paid by the Exchequer. At present there is no cate- 
chist. There is no Dissenting or Seceding chapel in the parish. 
Divine service at the Established Church is generally well attend- 
ed. The number of male communicants is about 30. A Bible 
society was instituted at Campbelton fifteen years ago; besides dis- 
tributing copies of the Scriptures in both languages, at reduced 
prices, and gratuitously, it grants donations of about L. 10 annually 
to other societies. The average annual amount of church collec- 
tions is about L. 20 ; for missionary and other purposes, L. 16. 

Education. — Besides the parochial school, there are three other 
schools in the village of Campbelton; one a private unendowed 
school ; a boarding-school for females ; and an infant school lately 
built under the auspices of Lady Anderson. The salary of the 
parochial schoolmaster is L. 36, 7s. Ifd. 

The late Rev. James Denoon of Rothsay, and Mr James Camp- 
bell of Baltimore, were among the early teachers in the parish 
school. The late Mr John Smith, for a period of forty-two years, 
efficiently discharged the duties of parochial schoolmaster. His 
school, so long as his physical powers were adequate to the arduous 
duties of teaching, was crowded by scholars from the surrounding 
district. Of his extensive classical knowledge, and happy manner 
of communicating the same, many of his pupils, who have distin- 
guished themselves in the different learned professions, bear livinc 
testimony. Mr Smith was a teacher in Abernethy and Kirkmi- 
chael, for sixteen years before he came to this parish ; and the Cel- 
tic Society, two years before his death, presented him with a o-old 
medal, in acknowledgement of his long and meritorious public 
services 

There is a Sabbath school in the village, which is well attended. 

Library.— k Subscription Library, on a small scale, was formed 
in Campbelton about two years ago, which, it is hoped, may tend 
to increase the intelligence, and promote the moral improvement 
of the people. 

Charitable and other Institutions.— There are two Fi-iendly So- 
cieties, which have existed for nearly forty years. Members pro- 
cure coals and meal at an easier rate,— the societies purchasing 
these articles with ready money at wholesale prices, and distributing 
them to the members at prime cost; and the funeral expense 
of members or their wives are defrayed by the society. The real 
advantage of this latter arrangement is questionable, as it encou- 
rages drinking at lyke-wakes and funerals, and certainly does not

promote a desire of independence. It would be more advanta- 
geous if they deposited their earnings in a savings' bank ; but as yet 
there is none in the parish, — the nearest, established about two 
years ago, being in Inverness. 

Poor and Parochial Fwids.— The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is about 60. From the inadequacy of the 
church collections to meet the real wants of the poor, private sub- 
scriptions were set on foot in the parish for the last three or four 
years. L. 20 were raised in this way about two years ago, and 
Earl Cawdor liberally contributed L.20 more. But, notwith- 
standing that the annual sum allowed to each pauper was materi- 
ally increased by these voluntary contributions, they have been 
found insufficient to prevent the weekly applications of beggars. 

_Fairs. — A great annual fair, the " Lammas Market," is held at 
Campbelton on the 12th of August,— being the only fair in the 
parish, and, its object and advantages being of a varied character, 
masses of people congregate. Numerous reapers, chiefly females, 
come from Ross-shire and the surrounding country, and they are 
readily hired for the harvest, by farmers from Moray and Nairn- 
shire, as well as from distant parts of this county. There is usu- 
ally a good show of lambs from Strathnairn, Stratherrick, and 
Strathglass ; soiTie sheep and milk cows, and a few horses. Wool 
and homespun plaidings, cheese, and fruits are among the com- 
modities of the country offered for sale. 

Inns, c— Of inns, ale-houses, and spirit-shops, there are no 
fewer than ten in the parish; all in the village of Campbelton. 
Whilst three or four inns for the accommodation of travellers 
would amply supply all reasonable demands for refreshment, it 
is too notorious, that, where there are so many competitors, the 
incitements and facilities offered, and the idle and dissolute habits 
formed, exert the most baneful influence on the morals of the 
people. 

Fuei—Kn abundant supply of coals from Sunderland and New- 
castle is brought to the beach at Campbelton, and is purchased 
for 15s. per ton. The carriage from the shore is lOd. per ton 
additional. There are two or three yards where coals are stored, 
and sold in the winter at a little increase of price. Peats arc 
brought from the parish of Cawdor, and other places, in small 
carts and sold at about Is. 6d. a load. Fire-wood is procured 
from the saw-mill at Kilravock and from Cawdor, at a reasonable 

rate.

I'RESBYTERY Of INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 

THE REV. C. ERASER, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
What now forms the parish of Kiltarlity consisted formerly of 
two parishes, Convinth and Kiltarlity. The date of their union 
is not known. 

Name. — It is supposed that the name Kiltarlity is derived from 
Gaelic words signifying the place of sepulture of Tarmil. But of 
the individual named Tarrail, nothing is known. It may be noticed, 
however, that there is a stone, known, for time immemorial, by the 
appellation of Clach Tarrail Tarrail's stone, still pointed out as 
that which covers his grave. This stone lies about half-a-mile 
south-west from the old churchyard of Kiltarlity. Anotheraccount 
of the origin of the name is, that the parsonage of Kiltarlity be- 
ing dedicated to St Thalargus, the burial-ground surrounding the 
church was called C'dle Thalargus, and, hence, by corruption, the 
r\Bme Kiltarlity . The name Convinth is supposed to be derived from 
two Gaelicwords, Conna Bheathach a ravenous animal ; and tra- 
dition says that this district obtained the name in consequence of 
a wild boar having long infested and committed great havoc 
therein. 

Extent. — This is considered among the largest parishes in the 
Highlands. From the north-east boundary to the north-west ex- 
tremity, the distance is calculated at about 45 miles. The Par- 
liamentary road which intersects the parish from east to west is up- 
wards of 40 miles ; the breadth of the parish is small in propor- 
tion to its great length, being, upon an average, only about six 
miles. 

Boundaries. — Kiltarlity is bounded by the united parishes of Ur- 
quhartand Glenmorriston on the south and south-west; by Glenshiel 
on the west; by Kintail on the north-west; by Kilmorack on the 
north; Kirkhill on the east; and by the parish of Inverness on the 
south-east. The whole northern part is bounded by Kilmorack,

The Davoch of Erchless and Annat, on the north side of the river 
Beauly, belong to this parish ; and another Davoch, consisting of 
three farms, called the Crochails, on the south side of the river 
Glass, belongs to the parish of Kilmorack : but, with the above ex- 
ceptions, Loch-Afiiiric, Loch-na- luire, and Loch-beinnemhian, 
together with the rivers Glass and Beauly, constitute the march be- 
tween the parishes of Killarlity and Kilmorack. 

Topograpliical Appearances. — There are hills on each side of the 
River Glass along the whole of its course : and, with the exception 
of a low- lying country, of about nine square miles at its eastern ex- 
tremity, the parish is composed of hilly and rocky ground, intersect- 
ed by valleys and lens, the most considerable of which are Strath- 
glass and Glenconvinth. The hills and mountains in this parish are 
not remarkably high ; probably the highest amongst them is Aonach 
Sassan, English HUl, on the property of William Fraser, Esq. of 
Culbockie. It is estimated at about 2000 feet above the level of the 
sea. They generally present a roughly rounded outline ; few, if 
any, ascending in the form of peaks. They range from east to 
west, and from south-east to north-west. Indeed, by far the 
greater part of the surface of the parish is very rugged and rocky. 
In the western portion, many of the rocks are inaccessible to human 
tread, and are inhabited by goats, which have become so wild, that 
their owners are under the necessity of shooting, ere they can take 
them. The presence of these creatures gives much additional in- 
terest to the solemn grandeur of the surrounding scenery. On 
ledges of these high rocks, eagles form their eyries and rear their 
young in defiance of the attempts sometimes made by shepherds 
to dislodge them. The peregrine falcon, formerly so much prized 
by the falconer for its docility and courage; the fork or salmon- 
tailed kite, the kestril, and the raven, dwell among the cliffs and 
ravines. Few places in the Highlands of Scotland can vie with 
Strathglass in romantic beauty and grandeur. The black and 
barren appearance of the rugged and towering mountains on either 
side, although happily relieved in many places by the presence of 
a considerable quantity of birch, hazel, and natural fir, contrasts 
well with the fertility and loveliness of the smiling vale below, 
through which the river Glass gently wends its serpentine course 
over a bed of purest sand, glistening like a silver thread in the light 
of a summer sun, and ever and anon concealed from view by the 
intervening foliage of a fripge of alder, mountain-ash, and weep- 
ing-birch, by which its banks are ornamented. So gently, indeed, 
docs the river How in many places, that a current is scarcely at all

perceptible, and its unrippled surface reflects, as from a mirror, 
the o-annt and hoary rocks which overlook it, and which seem as 
if placed sentry there for the purpose of preserving the peaceful 
and rustic scene below from ihe assault of conflicting elements or 
the intrusion of unhallowed strife. This romantic strath affords 
great attractions to tourists, many of whom visit it in the summer 
season. Gentlemen's seats are not numerous, but, the situations 
being generally very well chosen, they tend much to enliven the ap- 
pearance of the country. The most prominent and remarkable 
amongst them is a lofty turretted building called Erchless Castle. It 
is said to have been built in the fifteenth century, but is still in a 
state of excellent repair, and is kept up as the family mansion of 
" The Chisholm," chief of that ilk. It overlooks a noble park, 
studded with venerable aged-looking trees, among which are some 
of ihe remains of the old Caledonian forest. Besides a very con- 
siderable quantity of natural timber, there have been about 1000 
acres in the neighbourhood of Erchless, planted with larch, oak, 
ash, elm, beech, plane-tree, Scotch fir, chesnut, &amp;c. and all this 
has been done within the last twenty-four years. 

Of The Chisholm's property in this parish, there are about 750 
imperial acres of arable land kept in regular cultivation. The hill 
ground was never measured, so that the number of acres cannot 
be stated. The real rent of the property belonging to him in this 
parish, is about L. 1036. 

At Fasnacoil, which is upwards of twenty miles from where 
Beauly falls into the sea, the river Deaothack joins the Glass. 
This river is about forty feet in breadth, and from three to six feet 
in depth ; the stream is very rapid, and its course runs from west 
to east. It takes its rise from some springs and rivulets in the hills 
on the south side of Strathglass, and is upwards of twelve miles in 
length. The fishing upon it is very indiff"erent. consisting only of 
small trout and eels. For about four miles of the extent of this 
small river, there is a continuous succession of rapids and cascades, 
the most remarkable of which is Plodda Fall, situated about a mile 
and a half to the westward of Guisachan House. The proprietor 
Will iam Fraser, Esq. of Culbockie, has been at considerable 
expense in forming a pleasure-walk along the banks of this river, 
which possesses all the attractions which the most fanciful dispo- 
sition of rock and wood can contribute. The wood along the 
banks consists of old magnificent Scotch firs interspersed with 
oak and birch, which add much to the eff'ect of the scenery, in 

' A Gaelic word signifying that it occasionally becomes dry.

itself of a most grand and imposing nature. Some of the firs 
here measure from 14 to 16 feet in circumference, and are up- 
wards of 60 feet in height. About 400 yards from Guisachan 
House, which is a hirge and elegant mansion, surrounded by 
verdant lawns, there is a beautiful fall of water, well worthy of 
note. The stream is precipitated over a ledge of rock about 70 
feet high into a circular basin of considerable dimensions, form- 
ing a deep dark linn, which, together with the very romantic 
ravine through which the water escapes, is overhung by many 
species of wood, exhibiting the most luxuriant foliage, and in 
some cases very fantastic vegetation — the productions of an un- 
commonly fertile soil, watered by the spray which is continually 
falling around them. Indeed, none but those who have visited this 
romantic spot can form any idea of the varied scenery presented to 
their observation. The soil is as rich as any in the Lothians, and 
there is about the place altogether a pleasant air of comfort and 
neatness, which is greatly enhanced by the striking contrast it pre- 
sents to the steep mountains and rugged wilds with which it is 
environed. The venerable and worthy proprietor of this estate 
has evinced great taste in improving its natural beauties, and has 
taken advantage of the capabilities of the soil by introducing the 
most approved system of modern agriculture to a district, which, 
• though now nearly able to maintain itself without having recourse 
to the importation of corn from other parts of the country, was, 
until within a few years ago, inhabited by a wild, irregular, po- 
verty-stricken people, among whom the demoralising practice of 
illicit distillation prevailed to a very great extent, favoured and 
encouraged as it was, by the inaccessible nature of the sur- 
rounding country. Happily, however, these days are now gone 
by, and, owing to the judicious measures adopted by the pro- 
prietors for the encouragement of industry and the promotion 
of education, a great and beneficial change has been effect- 
ed, not only on the appearance of the country, but on the ha- 
bits and dispositions of the peasantry of Strathglass, who now, 
though perhaps, indeed, more excitable in temperament and less 
regularly industrious than their neighbours in the lower part of 
the parish, are, upon the whole, happy and contented with their 
lot in life ; and, in their bearing towards strangers, as well as in 
their intercourse with one another, evince a high degree of native 
politeness and hospitality, — while, at the same time, their almost 
uniformly respectful demeanour towards superiors is a pleasant 
trait in their character, which recommends them to the notice,

and secures the good will of all who may have occasion to sojourn 
in these parts. 

On the Glass, about a mile above Fasnacoil, there is a fall of 
water about 30 feet high, called Easnambroc, from the number 
of badgers which frequent the sandy soil in its neighbourhood. 
At Invercannich, about four miles further down than Fasnacoil, 
the river Cannich enters the Glass, and this river is again joined 
by the river Farrar, in front of The Chisholm's seat, and assumes 
the name of the Beauly for the rest of its course. Two excellent 
bridges cross these rivers about a mile above their junction ; and 
near that which crosses the Farrar, and which is strongly budt 
with granite, stands the house of Struy, the seat of an ancient 
and respectable branch of the clan Fraser, whose representative 
is the next in succession, as heir of entail, to the estates of Lovat, 
after the present chief, and the heirs-male of his body. The 
rivers Cannich and Farrar flow through districts of the parish of 
Kilmorack. The Beauly is the most considerable stream in the 
parish, and, though not navigable further than the village of 
Beauly, about a mile and a-half above where it falls into the 
sea, it is of considerable use as a means of transporting timber 
to where it can be conveniently shipped for exportation. The 
distance from the point of confluence between the rivers Farrar 
and Glass to the Beauly Firth, is about nine miles. To account 
for the fact that the fishing of this river belongs altogether to 
Lord Lovat, though proceeding through great part of the estates 
of conterminous proprietors, it is said that Simon Lord Lovat, on 
the occasion of the family possession being forfeited after the Re- 
bellion in 1715, requested his friend, the Duke of Gordon, who 
was then in favour at Court, to present a petition, which he had 
drawn out, to the king. The Duke did so, and it was found, on 
perusing its contents, that Lord Lovat's request was so modest 
and withal so strange, that the king, highly amused with the sup- 
posed eccentricity which dictated it, immediately gave orders th a 
it should be granted. His request was that " one lea rig behind 
the castle might be given to him and his heirs in perpetuity." 
The lea .rig is said to have meant the river. The revenue to the 
Noble proprietor from this source alone is very considerable, being 
stated to be rented at nearly L. 2000 per annum. The fishing of 
it gives employment to twelve men. 

About four miles below Erchless, the river leads to a small rus- 
tic hamlet called Wester Eskadale, on an eminence above which, 
though half-concealed by birch trees, appear the white walls and

pinnacles of a neat Roman Catholic Chapel, erected a few years 
ago by Lord Lovat at a considerable expense. Half-a-mile to 
the east of the chapel, the elegant mansion of Eskadale appears 
amid plantations and cultivated fields, and commands an extensive 
view of the Strath. On the opposite side of the river, and under 
the brow of a wooded hill, is the house of Aigas, a property 
which has lately been acquired by purchase and added to the other 
possessions of the family of Chisholm of Chisholm. Immediately 
below this, the river is divided into two streams, which, again unit- 
ing a little further down, enclose a very romantic piece of ground 
called the Island of Aigas. On this island, which is beautifully 
wooded with a profusion of oaks and weeping-birches, there has 
been lately erected, at the expense of the Right Honorable Lord 
Lovat, a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style of architec- 
ture; in which Messrs Hay Allan Stuart, said to be the only de- 
scendants of the unfortunate Prince Charles Edward, at present 
reside. These gentlemen have fitted it up in imitation of the style 
in which Highland chieftains were wont to decorate their rooms in 
times of yore. 

Their spacious rooms are hung around with iikes iind guns and bows, 
And swords and bucklers, which hnve stood against old Scotland's foes, 
And there in fitate they move about in kilt and tartan hose ; 
They quaif their quaichs of usquebaugh, and give poor men their brose, 
Like true-bred Highland gentlemen, who love the olden time." 

Eilean Aigas, as this island is generally called, is about three- 
quarters of a mile in length, and its banks rise abruptly to a pretty 
considerable height from the rocky channel of the river, which, 
at the lower end, forms a set of small but beautiful cascades. 
This place forms the eastern confines of the valley of Strathglass; 
and the river, now dashing along in an impetuous torrent, is wide- 
ly different in its aspect from the sluggish stream it appeared 
above. It plunges through a rocky channel at the bottom of a 
deep ravine, called the Dream or Druidhm, a place much famed 
for its romantic scenery. In some places, rocks ascend to a consi- 
derable elevation from the middle of the channel, and one of them, 
owing to its conical figure, is called the Sugar Loaf. In other 
places, the river subsides into deep dark linns, while the rock give 
way to green banks, small parts of which have been cultivated ; 
on both sides, the mountains are very steep and rugged, but their 
harshness is much redeemed by woods of birch and fir, with which 
they are clothed. The breadth of the valley is scarcely a quarter 
of a mile, and the roads on either side are at a very considerable 
height above the bed of the river, which is fringed all along with 
oak, weeping birches, and alders. The road on the north, or Kil-

morack side, is that generally used by travellers, and is confessedly 
one of the most romantic drives in the Highlands. On a con- 
spicuous mountain on the south side, are the remains of a vitrified 
structure, called Dunfion. Near this, the river enters a chasm 
between high precipitous cliffs, and cuts a narrow passage through 
masses of red sandstone and conglomerate, — so narrow, indeed, in 
some places, that a man in dry seasons can almost leap across. 
A little onwards, the foaming torrent rushes tumultuously over a 
ledge of rock, forming what is called the Upper Fall of Kihnorack. 
It is about 10 or 12 feet in height, and is received into a capaci- 
ous basin of hard rockr in the sides of which, fantastic caves and boil- 
ing caldrons have been formed by the action of the turbulent fluid. 
The summits of the rocks on either side of this deep ravine are 
hardly stone-cast distance asunder, and are ornamented with the 
light airy foliage of the birch and wild cherry ; while a little lower 
down, many weatherworn stunted trees of different kinds, growing out 
of fissures in the face of the almost perpendicular rock, rear up 
their gnarled and fantastic forms in defiance of the impetuosity of 
the wind. For a considerable way up from the stream, there is no 
vegetation of any kind to cover the barren nakedness of the rocks, 
with the exception of a thin sprinkling of marsh mallows and wild 
geraniums. In some sheltered nooks, however, luxuriant festoons 
of ivy and honeysuckle give evidence that these plants have been 
nurtured in a congenial soil. At a little distance below the up- 
peV fall, the river, emancipated from its confinement, glides on 
smoothly and majestically in a broad stream over a large surface 
of rock, inequalities in which soon cause it to diverge into several, 
different channels. The rock here comes to an abrupt termination 
across the whole expanse of the river, which is very broad at this 
part; and these different streams, falling from off the rock upon a 
bed of large rough stones, form what are called the Lower Falls of 
Kilmorack. These are only about 8 or 10 feet in height. 

It is a very interesting sight to witness the persevering efforts of 
salmon to spring over these falls. Many succeed in the attempt, 
but it is not thought worth the expense to fish the river with nets 
beyond the falls. The former Lovats were in the habit of amus- 
ing their guests with a very novel spectacle, viz. salmon leaping, of 
their own accord, into a kettleful of boiling water, where they were 
speedily cooked for the purposer of satiating the appetites as well 
as the curiosity of the beholders. Marvellous though it may ap- 
pear, this extraordinary exhibition was easily effected. It was ob-

served that the fish, in their attempts to clear the Upper Fall, were 
frequently driven back by the force of the current, and thrown 
upon a particular rock near the foot, whence they dropped into 
their native element. Advantage was taken of this well-known 
fact, and the fish so falling were secured by laying branches of 
trees on the rock, in such a way as to prevent their sliding back 
into the river ; and the idea of lighting a fire upon the rock and 
suspending a kettle over it was afterwards suggested to some fer- 
tile fancy. No recognized means are now resorted to for taking 
fish at this place, though poachers may sometimes be observed 
standing on the brink of the fall, and holding in their hands long 
poles with hooks or cliques attached to their ends, wherewith they 
often succeed in seizing the salmon in their attempts to spring 
over the cascades. There is a cruive on one of the lower falls, 
whereby a number of fish are intercepted in their progress to the 
spawning grounds. There is also another cruive about a mile fur- 
ther down the river, extending from side to side. 

On the point of a rock on the south side, and overlooking the 
falls, there has been erected, at the expense of the Right Honour- 
able Lady Lovat, an elegant seat surmounted by a small dome, 
with miniature turrets, and having its floor causewayed with small 
stones of various colours, to represent different figures. A pleasant 
shady walk, ornamented not only by numerous birches, but with 
rhododendrons and evergreens planted by Lord Lovat, serves to 
facilitate the approach of the tourist to this romantic spot, and con - 
ducts him along the Dream to the island of Aigas. In some parts 
of it, the spectator is apt to feel dizzy while contemplating the 
foaming water struggling through the deep abyss ; while, far be- 
low, he sees the daw, the ring-dove, and the kestril harmoniously 
dwelling together, and, undisturbed by the overpowering din of the 
cataract, busily engaged in constructing their nests in the holes 
and clefts of the rock. The garden belonging to the minister of 
Kilmorack is picturesquely situated on a rock overhanging the 
north side, on a crag, at the utmost verge of which, there is a fine 
summer-house, also fitted up by Lady Lovat, in a style correspond- 
ing with the cupola already alluded to, on the opposite side. 

Hydrograplnj. — The number of lakes in the parish is very great. 
The largest and most remarkable for their surrounding scenery 
are Loch Affaric, Lochnaluire, and Lochbeinnemhian. The ro- 
mantic grandeur of this section of the parish will bear comparison 
with that of any part of the Highlands of Scotland. The hills 
and mountains on either side are ornamented by the presence of 



KILTARLITY.

birch, mountain-ash, and magnificent firs, relics of the old Cale- 
donian forest. These lakes are very deep, and abound in various 
kinds of small trout. Loch AfFaric is about seven miles in length 
by one in breadth ; Lochnaluire is three miles by one-half ; and 
Lochbeinnerahian, four miles by one. These lakes are joined to- 
gether by the river Glass, which takes its rise from Loch AfFaric, 
and thence proceeds through the other two lakes, and a consider- 
able part of the country beyond them in a south-easterly direction. 
Near Guisachan, however, it takes a different course, and follows 
the bottom of the valley of Strathglass, which lies in a line from 
west to east. 

Probably the best trout in any lake in the parish is that found 
in Loch Bruiach, which lies somewhat more than four miles due 
west from the parish church, and is about three miles in circum- 
ference. There are said to be no less than seven different species 
of trout found in this loch. A great number of the finest char 
are caught here in September, when they repair to the shallows 
for spawning. A small loch, called Lochgarbhreachd, about 
a quarter of a mile to the west of Loch Bruiach, affords excel- 
lent sport, though the trout are smaller and inferior in flavour 
to those caught in the latter- In Loch Neattie, which is about 
a mile and a-half from Loch Bruiach, there is abundance of 
pike. Lochgorm, Lochnambreacdearg, and Lochcarnabattan, 
are, among others too numerous to mention, considered excellent 
for angling, though some of them require that a person should be 
able to cast the line skilfully, owing to the quantity of reeds grow- 
ing on their margins. 

Geology. — The higher and more inland portions of this parish con- 
sist of gneiss and granite rocks, chiefly the former, which is frequent- 
ly traversed by various granite veins of various sizes and different 
ages, being united to the great central masses of gneiss which con- 
stitute the bulk of Inverness-shire. The ridges declining towards 
the north, however, are skirted and overlain by deposits of the 

• In speaking of these lakes, the Messrs Anderson of Inverness, in their ineeni- 
ous and valuable work entitled " Guide to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland," 
eloquently but justly remark, that " they are surrounded by the relics of an enor- 
mous pine forest ; their islands and their shores are almost impervious from the 
crowded stems of the trees; and the far-famed scenery of Loch Catrine and the 
Irossachs smks mto insignificance when contrasted with the similar assemblage of 
rock, wood, and water displayed in this neighbourhood, on a scale so much more 
extended and magnificent — The dun deer of the forest here, in the centre of the isle, 
where hunters there are none,' have marshalled themselves in great numbers : the 
eagle builds his eyrie unmolested, and soars aloft sole lord of the high and wild scuirs 
which rise up from the west coast, and which bewilder the senses of the spectator by 
thir multitude and utter blackness and sterility."

old red sandstone, which compose the great basin of the Moray 
Frith, and which here rests unconformably on the primary strata. 
Spurs of the gneiss and granite frequently cut across the sand- 
stone, thus rendering the scenery more rough and picturesque than 
it would otherwise be, while the softer rockgives rise to exceedingly 
beautiful and fertile valleys between them. The sandstone also 
appears at one time to have risen high above the older rocks, for, 
in the south-western parts of the parish, bordering on that of 
Urquhart, there are very high detached rounded caps and sum- 
mits, as well as extensive ridges of the old red conglomerate, 
which, on passing through Glenconvinth, show themselves to have 
been at one time united both to the Moray Frith basin, and also to 
the great central deposit of sandstone at Mealfourvonie near Loch- 
Ness. Indications of extensive denudation everywhere exist ; 
and, underneath the highest conglomerate summits, are a series 
of dark and deep lakes or tarns, which here, as elsewhere in this 
neighbourhood, are most numerous near the line of junction of 
the crystalline with the arenaceous deposits. The small forma- 
tion of serpentine behind Polmally in Glenurquhart stretches up- 
wards towards the confines of Kiltarlity, and numerous beds of 
primary granular limestone exist in the district, none of which, 
however, are extensively worked, it being a matter of general belief, 
though whether on good grounds I know not, that foreign lime 
produces a better effect on land than that manufactured from 
stone found in the same district as the land on which jt is used. 
The most thriving woods and plantations are situated on the 
sandstone ridges, or on the gravel beds and terraces which extend 
from their bases to the river Beauly. 

Specimens of asbestos and rock-crystal are often met with in 
the hills. 

There are no mines in this parish, although the taste and colour 
of many of the springs indicate the presence of iron ore. It is 
believed that a mine was once worked in the Mains of Strathglass, 
but there is no certainty as to where it was situated or what the 
mineral found was, though it most probably was plumbago, of the 
same quality as that found in the parish of Kilmorack, and which 
has not as yet been very productive. 

In the upper part of the district of Strathglass, at Gugie, on 
the property of Guisachan, there is a cave of considerable dimen- 
sions ; the access to it is very narrow, owing to the propinquity of 
tw o shelving rocks. Another cave, in a glen called Corriedow, on 
the western" extremity of the parish, is said to have afforded refuge

to the unfortunate Prince Charles Edward Stuart for some days.' 
There is a cave in the rocks of Easter Main of considerable size. 

Soil. — The soil in the parish is, generally speaking, thin and light. 
There is not much good land throughout the whole of it. The 
most of the soil is of a reddish colour and very hard. It is found 
to be very difficult to trench it, from the number of stones which 
it contains, and it requires a great quantity of lime and manure ere 
a good crop can be raised from it. The expense of taking in 
new land may be estimated at about L. 12 per acre, but this in- 
cludes liming, clearing it of stones, &amp;c. The expense of trenching 
it is generally about L. 8 per acre. There is always some com- 
pensation given to the tenant, by the proprietor, for reclaimed land. 
The eastern or lower part of the parish is more fertile than the 
upper, where, owing to the mossy nature of the soil, the crops at 
an early stage of their growth acquire a purplish sickly appear- 
ance. This parish suffers much in a dry season, from the natural 
dryness of the soil, as well as from the small supply of moisture in 
the air. The average rent of arable land in the parish may be 
stated at L. 1, 10s. per acre. 

Zoology. — The quadrupeds are such as are common to the neigh- 
bouring parishes. The hedgehog and squirrel have not yet reach- 
ed this district. The cross-bill breeds in the pine forests, and re- 
mains during the whole year. — The fishes in the lakes and rivers are 
such as are common to this part of the country, and require no par- 
ticular enumeration.

Wood. — Strathglass, of old, was mostly altogether covered with 
wood, of which, with the exception of the forest of Cugie, on'the 
property of Guisachan, but few living remains now exist through- 
out the parish, though traces of it are everywhere to be met with 
in the peat mosses, where the poorer peasantry dig up great num- 
bers of the trunks, which, being very resinous, afford them a cheap 
and tolerably good light, during the long winter evenings. Some 
of the old firs in the forest of Cugie are immensely large, being 
between sixty and seventy feet in height, and sixteen feet in girth. 
The Protector Cromwell used a great quantity of timber from 
Strathglass, in the construction of his fortifications at Inverness, 
and, in fact, until within late years, wood was the only article ex- 
ported from the parish, many parts of which, owing to the gravelly 
nature of the soil, seem peculiarly adapted for its growth. Larch 
thrives amazingly, and it is not uncommon to find specimens of 
this valuable wood, which, at forty years of age, measure 30, and 
at fifteen years, measure 12 cubic feet; and a blemish is rarely found 
in this kind of timber. The ash, though slow in arriving at ma- 
turity, is of excellent quality. Natural fir fetches at the rate of 
Is. 6d. per cubic foot when manufactured ; planted fir, 6d per cu- 
bic foot not manufactured ; do. do. Is. per do. when manufactur- 
ed ; ash and oak generally sell at 2s. per cubic foot in the tree ; 
birch for barrel staves fetches L. 4, 4s. per thousand ; elm, beech, 
and plane tree, sell at Is. 6d. per cubic foot in the tree ; birch and 
oak bark average -L. 6 per ton. 

The common Scotch fir is not planted so much as formerly, 
the preference being now decidedly in favour of larch, as not only 
more marketable but of quicker growth. 

There are many new plantations in the parish, and the different 
heritors, of late years, pay much more attention than they were 
wont to do, to periodical and regular thinnings, being convinced 
that the value of their woods is much increased by this process. 

II. — Civil HiSTORy, 
Parochial Registers. — The only public records of any kind kept 
in the parish, are those of births and marriages. The former be- 
gins in 1714, and the latter in 1812 ; but though the former was 
kept for the whole of the period since 1714, it is to be regretted

that the entries were not by any means regularly made, and tin's 
cn-Gumstance is probably as much owing to a strong prejudice 
which obtained against it in the minds of the people, as from any 
remissness or neglect on the part of the clerk. 

Antiquities. — There are many Druidical remains in the parish, 
and also some vitrified forts supposed by most people to be where 
beacon fires used to be lighted in ancient times : but I am not 
aware that any thing of a peculiarly interesting nature has ever 
been discovered in or about them. There are three or four of 
the " Druidical temples" within a mile of the parish church. 

Ma nsion-houses. — Beaufort Castle, the residence of the Rifht 
Honourable Lord Lovat, is a lare and commodious but very plain- 
looking building, having been originally intended only as a resi- 
dence for the Government factor, during the time that the Lovat 
estate lay under forfeiture ; and, although the present chief of 
the clan Fraser, some time ago, had it in contemplation to erect 
a more magnificent habitation, the project appears to have been 
abandoned, at least for the present. It stands on the site of 
the old fortress of Beaufort or Downie ; and mention is made of 
it in Scottish story, so early as the era of Alexander L, when it 
sustained a regular siege by the royal troops, and the trenches then 
made are still visible. It was also seized by Oliver Cromwell, and 
the citadel blown up ; and immediately after the battle at CuUo- 
den, it was burnt and razed to the ground by the Duke of Cum- 
berland's army, and the flames of the conflagration were witnessed 
by Simon, Lord Lovat, from a high mountain near Loch Muilie, 
in Glenstrathfarrar, in which is a small island, whither he and a 
few faithful adherents had retreated. The accommodations of the 
fortress, at this time, appear to have been very limited indeed; for 
Lord Lovat, as related by his own chronicler, " received company 
and dined with them in the same room in which he slept. His 
lady's sole apartment was her bedchamber, and the only provision 
for lodging the domestics and the numerous herd of retainers was 
a quantity of straw on the four lower rooms of the tower; some- 
times above 400 persons were kennelled here." It is said, that the 
present is the twelfth edifice which has been erected on the same 
site, and, indeed, a more eligible and delightful situation could not 
be pitched upon for the chieftain's residence. It commands an 
extensive view of the whole of the Aird or Fraser country, and the 
Beauly Frith. In front of the mansion, there are extensive parks, 
studded with large trees of various kinds, and a very considerable

extent of the ground in the vicinity of the castle has been taste- 
fully laid out as a rosary and flower-garden by the Hight Honour- 
able Lady Lovat. 

Family of Fraser of Lovat — Before the Erasers came into 
possession of them, the estates of Lovat, as also a great part 
of Stratherric and Abertarff, belonged to a very powerful fa- 
mily of the name of Bizzet. The Erasers appear to have come 
to Inverness-shire about the end of the thirteenth century, 
from the counties of Peebles and Tweeddale, in the former or 
latter of which the ruins of their principal residence. Castle 
Fraser, may still be seen. The prevalence of the name Fraser 
in this district is accounted for, by a tradition that the Biz- 
zets were induced, from various motives, to assume it instead of 
their own, on the occasion of the accession of the Fraser family to 
the estate. Be that as it may, there are certainly hardly any Biz- 
zets now to be met with in this country. 

The late Mr Fraser of Lovat died without issue, and the pro- 
perty an entailed one descended to a distant branch, possessing 
the estate of Strichen in Aberdeenshire. The present proprie- 
tor is the prir-cipal heritor of this parish, and was raised to the 
Peerage in 1837. He also possesses extensive lands in several of 
the surrounding parishes, and is much esteemed by his tenantry as 
a kind and considerate landlord. The family resides almost al- 
ways in the country, and his Lordship, by annually expending im- 
mense sums in improving and adorning his estate, provides employ- 
ment for a great number of the peasantry, who, were this not the 
case, might be obliged to migrate elsewhere in search of a livelihood. 
At the same time that the fact speaks volumes for the unosten- 
tatious charity, and active benevolence of Lady Lovat, it is very 
gratifying to have it to, state, that the more necessitous of the 
poor in the parish are, by the directions and at the expense of this 
amiable lady, liberally supplied with nourishing food and warm 
clothing, and the best steps adopted for having their other wants 
relieved so soon as made known. The number of poor privately 
comforted in this way is very considerable. 

The present family of Lovat professes the Roman Catholic reli- 
gion, and Lady Lovat is descended of one of the oldest and high- 
est Roman Catholic families in England, being daughter to Lord 
Stafford. 

£e//a£/rw/d.— About a mile southward from Beaufort, hes the ele- 
gant mansion house of Belladrum. It is about three or four hundred

INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



yards from the public road, which here serves as the boundary be- 
tween the two estates ; but the numerous trees in the surround- 
ing pleasure-grounds are so disposed, that the passing traveller 
can hardly catch a glimpse of it. The house is quite a modern 
one, and is furnished in a most splendid manner. It was built at a 
very considerable expense by the late proprietor, James Fraser, 
Esq., who also erected in the neighbourhood a farm-steading 
of corresponding magnificence. The property was purchased 
by John Stewart, Esq. of Carnousie, for the sum of L. 80,000. 
For a great many years past, much care has been observed in lay- 
ing out the grounds and woods in the neighbourhood. The gar- 
dens, orchards, and shrubberies, together with the hot-houses and 
green-houses, are admirably kept, and evidences of a superior 
taste are every where discernible. A great part of the property is 
covered with valuable timber, consisting principally of Scotch fir 
and larch. The portions already disposed of and cut down have 
yielded a handsome sum to the present owner, who pays much at- 
tention to the thinning and proper management of his forests ; and 
by his directions, the blanks caused by the cutting are in the 
course of being planted with timber of a different sort from that 
which formerly grew on the same soil. The rental of the Bel- 
ladrum estate is supposed to be about L. 1600; and a considera- 
ble part of it is considered to be improvable. The most of it, 
however, consists of hilly pasture ground, abounding in various 
sorts of game, as roe, hare, black-game, grouse, partridge, &amp;c. 
The lakes and marshes on the property, though not much worth 
for the angling to be got on them, are resorted to by various kinds 
of water-fowl. The number of acres on this estate is 4300, be- 
ing composed of about 700 acres of arable, 2600 acres of pasture, 
and about 1000 acres under wood. Mr Stewart and his family ge- 
nerally reside for some , months in the year at Belladrum, where 
their warm and active benevolence command the esteem and re- 
spect of all around them.

the population was estimated at 2669.

Thus showing that fully threefourths of the entire population 
were, at that time, of the poor or labouring classes, and I am of 
opinion that the proportions are still about the same. The only 
Dissenters in the parish are Roman Catholics. 

The language usually spoken is the Gaelic, but it is losing 
gfound rapidly. 

IV. — Industry 

Labourers receive from Is. to Is. 6d., and tradesmen from 2s. 
to 3s. per day. Women earn Is. per day during the harvest season, 
but only receive from 6d. to 9d. per day for field labour, during 
the rest of the year. Farm-servants, besides a fair allowance of 
victual and fuel, receive from L. 8 to L. 12 per annum, accord- 
ing to their character and qualifications. Housemaids and other 
female domestics receive, on an average, from L. 3 to L. 4 per an- 
num ; few of them obtain so much as L. 4, JOs. 

Agriculture has made rapid progress here within the last twenty 
years, and due attention is now paid to liming, draining, and the 
most approved rotation in cropping. 

To illustrate the rapid change which has taken place in Strath- 
glass within the last few years, I may mention that about eight 
years ago, when the existing leases were granted, the arable land 
would not average above 10s. per acre ; but now that such effec- 
tive measures have been resorted to for the prevention of smug- 
gling, the same laid may be considered worth at least L. 1 per 
acre. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

The nearest post-office is at the village of Beauly, which is 
about two miles from the eastern boundary of the parish, but there 
is a runner who daily traverses a great part of the parish, and 
leaves the letters at centrical receiving-houses. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, which was built in 
1829, is only about three miles from the eastern extremity of the 
parish, so that, unless the mission comprehended the district of 
Strathglass, its situation might be justly considered as extremely 
inconvenient for the parishioners at large. It is built on the same 



500 



INVEIINESS-SHIIIE. 



foundation as the former church, which was erected in 1763, and, 
being on a rising ground in the midst of a clump of tall trees, its 
position is much admired. The surrounding ground has not been 
long in use as a place of sepulture, — the late incumbent, Dr Bayne, 
having been the first who was interred in it. The number of sit- 
tings in the church is about 800. 

The late Chisholm of Chisholm, who represented this county 
in Parliament for several years, and who was likewise much and 
deservedly esteemed, not only for His exemplary piety, but for his 
consistent and zealous support of the cause of Protestanism, short- 
ly before his death built at Erchless a very neat church in con- 
.nection with the Establishment. In this church, which is capable 
of accommodating about 400 people, there is preaching regularly, 
the services of a clergyman being secured and paid for by The Chis- 
holm, whose liberality in this as well as in many other respects, is 
worthy of much commendation. The sittings in these churches are 
all free. The parishioners are decidedly a church-going people, 
and the several places of worship are respectably attended. 

The manse is very large and commodious, and was built in 
1838. The glebe is also extensive, being nearly equal to 50 acres, 
but it is not valuable, the soil being very thin and poor. Upwards 
of the half of it is arable, and the annual value of the whole may 
be nearly L. 30. 

The stipend is L. 204, lOs. 8jd. in money; 17 bolls, 1 firlot, 
and three pecks of oatmeal; and 19 bolls, 1 peck, and 1 lippy, 
of barley, including allowance for communion elements. The value 
of the victual part varies according to the fiars prices ; but the sti- 
pend may be estimated at about L. '240, and it is wholly derivable 
from parsonage-teinds. The only privilege which the incumbent 
has, is fhat of cutting peats. 

The mission of Strathglass, to which reference is made above, 
comprehends not only the upper portion of the parish of Kiltarli- 
ty, but also that of Kilmorack, and the missionary preaches at 
three different stations. His income is about L. 80, of which he 
receives L. 60 from the Committee on the Royal Bounty, and the 
other L. 20 are contributed by his hearers. Nearly one-half of 
the population of the mission district belongs to the Roman 
Catholic faith. 

A Roman CathoHc congregation has been established in the 
parish, for about fifteen or sixteen years, and consists of from 700 



KILTAULITY. 



501 



to 800 individuals, of whom, however, a large proportion belongs 
to other parishes. 

There is a catechist in the parish, who is supported by volun- 
tary contribution. 

The number of communicants belonging to the Establishment 

is about 120. 

Poor. — The average amount annually expended on the poor is 
about L. 25, of which sum there arises from church collections 
about L. 16. The number of individuals deriving aid from the 
poor's roll is 77. 

The people have the greatest repugnance to apply for parochial 
aid, and there are many instances where they have submitted to 
the most abject penury and distress, rather than incur the degra- 
dation of becoming mendicants, or even soliciting such trifling as- 
sistance as the parochial funds could afford to give them. 

Education. — The number of schools in this parish is seven, and 
the branches generally taught in them are, reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, though in one or two of them a boy occasionally may be 
found studying the dead languages. The people appear to be alive 
to the benefits of a plain common education. There are no parts of 
the parish so distant as to prevent attendance at one or other of 
the schools. The average number in each is as follows : 



Kiharlity, palish school, . . . • • 80 

Mauld. do. . . • ... 40 

Knockfin, do. ..... 40 

Fanellan, Assembly school, . '. • • 70 

Bog, supported by individual subscription, ... 40 

Glenconvinth, do do. ... . 60 

• Female school at Kiltarlity, endowed by the Right Honourable Lady Lovat, 30 

Average number of children in the parish attending school, . 360 



The salary of the teacher in the principal parish school, which 
is that of Kiltarlity, is L. 25, 16s., and the fees may amount to 
from L.15 to L.20 annually. The scale of fees is much the same 
in the whole of these schools. The salary in each of the other 
two parochial schools, which have only been recently established, 
is L.12, 18s. ; but The Chisholm has liberally made up their sa- 
laries to L. 25. The continuance of this boon, however, is quite 
voluntary on the part of The Chisholm, though it is not likely that 

" Patron Lord Lovat had the patronage of this as well as many other parishes, 

in his gift, until about four years ago, vrhen he transferred this right of presentation 
to Hercules Scott, Esq. Professor of Moral Philosophy at King's College of Aber- 
deen. It is supposed that this was done in order to do away with any objections 
which might arise, in consequence of Lord Lovat's exercising his right of presenta- 
tion, he being of a different persuasion. 



502 



INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



It will be withdrawn, so long as he is satisfied that the duties of 
the offices are efficiently discharged. 

The female school was erected about twelve years ago by 
Lady Lovat, who gives the mistress a salary of L.15 per annum. 
The want of such a school as this was much felt, and it has been 
productive of great good. The building is a very neat and taste- 
ful structure, and, besides the school-room, includes ample accom- 
modation for the teacher. 

Inns. — There are only two or three inns in the whole parish, 
and even these are of an inferior description, and not much fre- 
quented. Whisky is the principal liquor retailed; malt liquor 
being seldom called for, and, indeed, not often to be had, if re- 
quired. 

Fuel— The fuel in general use is peat, and no charge whatever 
is made by the land-owners for the privilege of cutting it, which 
has been exercised, for time immemorial, Iby the tenantry and cot- 
tars on the several properties. English coal is also used by those 
who can afford to purchase it, and abundance of this mineral can 
generally be got at Beauly, at prices varying from Is. 8d. to 2s. 
per barrel. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Generally, and in conclusion, I may remark that in Strathglass, 
sheep-farming is carried on to a considerable extent, and that with 
less risk than in most other Highland districts, owing to the excel- 
lent shelter which is afforded to the flocks in winter, by the natu- 
ral wood, with which the sheep-walks abound. The leases, for 
the most part, are too short to induce the tenantry to incur the ex- 
pense of planting, and the proprietors are only now becoming aware 
of the immense importance of warmth and shelter to almost all kinds 
of animals. Not half so much is lost by vermin now as formerly, 
owing to the number of keepers employed to preserve the game ; 
and, from the same cause, that grouse and ptarmigan are rapidly 
encreasing in number, few of the sheep or lambs are lost, and the 
rents, as a necessary consequence, must soon improve and amply 
repay the proprietors for the expense to which they may be put. 

It is matter of pride among the natives of the parish to have it 
-in their power to say that, among the resident heritors, there are 
the honoured chieftains of two ancient and most respectable High- 
land clans.

PllESBYTERY OF ABERTARFF, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. JOHN M'INTYRE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The length of this parish from south 
to north, is about 60 miles, and its greatest breadth, 20. It is 
bounded by the parish of Kilmalie on the west ; by Fortingal on 
the south-east ; by Laggan on the east ; by Glenelg and Kintail 
on the north ; and by Boleskine on the north-east. 

Mountains, — This is the most mountainous parish perhaps in 
the kingdom. The lofty range from Glennevis on the west ex- 
tends eastward a distance of nearly twenty miles, and is from ten 
to fifteen miles in breadth. At the western end of this range, is the 
lofty Bennevis, arising majestically about 4370 feet above the level 
of the sea. It has tremendous precipices where the eagle builds 
his eyrie, and sets at defiance the power and ingenuity of man to 
disturb his habitation. It consists for the most part of fine brown 
porphyry. It contains plutonic rocks at the very top, and in some 
parts red granite, of such a beautiful grain as to be capable of the 
finest polish, and to be unmatched by any in any part of the world. 
It is supposed to contain also veins of silver. In the fissures of this 
mountain, the snow has remained from the remotest ages. Some 
other peaks of this range rise considerably more than 4000 feet 
above the level of the sea.f 

From notes furnished by the Rev. Donald Cameron, Laggan, and others, 
h The most splendid view is obtained from the top of Bennevis on a clear day. 
Persons that attempt the ascent without a guide often find themselves in awkward 
and sometimes in perilous situations. A few years ago, the Duchess of Buccleuch, 
while sojournmg in this vicinity, with her brotlier-in-law. Lord John Scott, and 
others, set out accompanied only with a guide, on an excursion to the summit. They 
reached their destination in safety ; but in returning, night overtook them, and they 
lost their way. The party left behind felt alarmed for her G race's safety, and re- 
solved on setting out in search of her. They applied to John M' Donald, Esq. of the 
Bennevis distillery for his aid in this emergency. His ingenuity was not long in 
hnding a plan, likely to discover the Duchess if she was alive, and the result proved 
successful. He took with him a large bell ; and with this, he and his party set off

Bennevis and its satellites to the east, form the southern side or 
section of Glenspean. This glen commences about the foot of Ben- 
nevis, and extends to the north of High Bridge, about ten miles. 
It gradually becomes narrower for fourteen miles, until a little 
above Keppoch, the whole breadth is occupied by the bed of the 
rapid river Spean. Three miles above that, it begins again to ex- 
pand ; and it terminates at the west end of Loch Laggan. The 
hills forming the northern boundaries of this glen are not so ma- 
jestic, nor so continuous as those on the south side. Near the 
centre, it is joined by Glenroy. This glen rises in a north-east di- 
rection, and terminates at the confines of the parish of Laggan. 
The two sides of Glenroy are formed of pretty high hills. Through 
a part of this parish runs the great Caledonian glen, from the 
west end of Loch Lochy to the east end of Loch Oich, a distance 
of nearly fifteen miles. Between these two lakes a portion of the 
Caledonian Canal is cut for about three miles. On each side this 
glen are lofty mountains rising precipitously from their base. Near- 
ly halfway between Inverness and Fort- William, Glenroy branches 
off to the north, at right angles from the great Caledonian Glen 
already mentioned, and joins Glenquoich ; and at its north-western 
extremity, it joins the district of Knoidart. 

Sheep and Sheep-walks. — The hills and glens of this parish af- 
ford the most excellent pasture for sheep and black-cattle, — par- 
ticularly the former. It is supposed that there are upwards of 
100,000 sheep reared in this parish every year. Some of the 
sheep farms are upwards of 100 square miles in extent. Mr 
Cameron, Carychvilly, the most extensive grazier in the north, 
stated a few years ago, that the preceding year he had clipped 
upwards of 37,000 sheep. Some of his farms, however, are 
situated in other parishes. Mr Greig of TuUach, and the Messrs 
M'Donell of Keppoch, are supposed to have each near 100 square 
miles under sheep ; the one on the north, and the other on the 
south banks of the Spean. GLnquoich at one time paid about 
L.1200 of yearly rent, and could graze perhaps 10,000 sheep, 
besides a proportionate number of black-cattle. 

Perhaps there is no part of the Highlands where nature has 
done more, and landlords so little, for the benefit of the inhabit- 
in the direction which they supposed the Duchess to have taken. The sound of the 
bell reverberating against the rocks, reached the delighted ears of her Grace ; and 
she was thus ultimately rescued from the effects of her Sabbath day's excursion.

ants, as some parts of the parish of Kihnonivaig. In Glenspean 
alone, there are upwards of 40,000 acres of excellent soil, which, 
by the application of skill and capital, could be brought into cul- 
tivation. Thus, in the course of thirty years, the value of land 
might be increased tenfold. The character might be improved, 
and so might the habits, comforts, and morals of the inhabitants. 
Under a proper system of management, the people would have 
strong inducements to active exertion ; and the present practice of 
spending a great part of their time in idleness, or in balls, raffles, 
shinty-matches, and whisky shops, would disappear. An improv- 
ed system of husbandry, introduced into Lochaber, would be of 
signal benefit to a great portion of the Highlands. It would render 
meal and potatoes plentiful, and keep in the country the money 
sent out of it every year to procure these necessaries of life. Great 
quantities of butcher-meat could be reared, and easily sent to the 
Glasgow and Liverpool markets by means of the steam-boats. 
Ireland is not the only country that suffers from the system of 
middlemen and absenteeism. 

Rivers. — Glenspean, which constitutes the principal part of 
this parish, is in shape somewhat like an hour-glass. At the 
north-east corner it receives the Spean from Lochlaggan. About 
a quarter of a mile after it leaves the lake, it receives the Gulbin 
from the south. Three streams rise at the side of Benalder, in 
the parish of Laggan, within a few yards of each other. The one 
travels east and north for ten or twelve miles, and then turns west, 
and empties itself in Lochlaggan. In this locality, it is called the 
Pattak. The other runs out of the same black hillock, and, after 
travelling south for many miles, and receiving many tributary 
streamlets, it turns north ; and at a place called Moy, under the 
name of Gulbin, it meets the Pattak, coming out of Lochlaggan, 
transformed into the Spean, From the south-west angle of Glen-, 
spean comes the river Treig. This river rises at the south side 
of Bennevis. It flows eastward to Lochtreig, then travels north, 
and meets the Spean, near to where the glen becomes narrow. 
It flows then north-west, till it joins the Lochy, at Mucomer, and 
after rising at the one side of Bennevis, and travelling upwards of 
fifty miles, it falls into the sea at Fort- William. Three mountain 
streams aflford excellent trout-fishing. The only river of note in 
this parish besides the Spean is the Garry.

lebrated indented lines is taken from the Edinburgh Philosophi-

cal Journal, Vol. xxvii. Tliey are sitjated in Gleuroy, a lateral 
branch of the larger Glen Spean, about ten miles to the north 
of Fort- William. Glenroy is about eleven miles in length, 
and one mile in breadth, with pretty steep sides. The stream 
Spean falls into the river Lochy, near Loch Lochy, and the 
Roy falls into the Spean, five miles eastward. On both sides 
of Glenroy, there are three narrow terraces or roads, formed 
of gravel and clay, called the " Parallel roads." They project 
several feet from the sloping side of the mountain, forming 
three slightly marked lines along the valley from end to end, and 
exactly parallel to each other. At some parts they are not to be 
seen, such as when they cross the bare hard rock, where loose soil 
or gravel would not rest, and where the surface of the hill is gently 
inclined, because the slope there coincides with that of the allu- 
vial cover. Very often the appearance is so faint, that a spectator 
may find himself standing on one without being aware of its exist- 
ence ; but, at other parts, they swell out into pretty broad terraces, 
and, what seemed obscure to a spectator in juxtaposition with it, 
becomes more distinct when seen from the opposite side of the 
valley, where the eye takes in the line for a length of some miles. 
Each of these terraces, by the test of the level, have been found 
not only horizontal in their individual bearing longitudinallj', but 
also horizontal as regards the corresponding terrace on the oppo- 
site side. The first or lowest terrace is 972 feet above the level 
of the sea; the second is 1184 feet, while the third is 1266 feet. 
The base of the terraces have an inclination towards the centre of 
the valley. In the valley of Glen Gloy, in the vicinity, which is 
separated by a ridge of high ground of about half a mile thick, 
there is a terrace twelve feet higher than the highest in the for- 
mer, or 1278 feet above the sea level, but none lower. There is 
a i-emnant of a similar terrace at Kilfinnan, four miles northward, 
which is 40 feet higher than the highest in Glenroy, or 1306 
feet above the surface of the sea. The three terraces of Glen- 
roy follow the line of the valley down to its junction with Glen 
Spean, passing into all its sinuosities and recesses. Here two of 
them disappear ; but the lowest continues its course up to the 
head of Glen Spean, and down nearly to its mouth, over a space 
of twenty miles, always preserving the same level. Portions of 
terraces have also been traced on the sides of the valley of the

loch, who both about the same time described thee roads, account 
for their formation thus: In lochs which have steep banks covered 
with somewhat loose materials, rains and storms hurry down earth 
and stones, which have their motion checked when they reach the 
waters, and then form a projecting ledge or shelf, which is nearly 
on a level with its littoral surface, and slopes gradually onwards 
below its water, so that if the loch were partially drained a circu- 
lar terrace would thus be left at its former margin. If a second 
and third drainage took place at certain intervals, other terraces 
would thus be formed till the whole waters were evacuated. 

It has been supposed, then, that Glenroy, Glen Gloy, and 
Glen Spean, originally formed distinct lochs, each closed in by a 
barrier at its end ; that the barrier at Glenroy gave way partially, 
so that the waters of the loch rushed out to a certain extent, and 
left the highest terrace ; succeeding evacuations formed the second 
and third terraces in a similar manner, till at last the loch-was com-- 
pletely emptied. At the period of the formation of the lowest 
terrace, it is supposed Glenroy and Spean formed one continu- 
ous line of water, because the same terrace extends along the side 
of Glen Spean for twenty miles, while no trace of the higher ter- 
races are found in the latter. Glen Gloy is supposed to have 
formed a distinct loch, with the water elevated twelve feet above 
the others, when, its barrier giving way, it was at once emptied 
without the formation of any more terraces. It must be ad- 
mitted, however, that no vestiges of terraces or indications in 
the strata, are now to be found. Mr Darwin has lately pro- 
posed another theory: that the terraces are sea-beaches,' form- 
ed at the period when the now elevated land constituted a low and 
level bay of the ocean, and that the periodical elevation of this 
land gave time for the formation of two or three littoral indentations. 
Mr Darwin illustrates his theory by analogous phenomena in Peru.

Avtiquities — Inverlochy Castle.— Many stories are told, that as- 
sign a great antiquity to this castle. But since certain documents 
were brought to light by the late Donald Gregory, author of the 
History of the Western Islands, its claims to high antiquity have 
been reduced, as it appears to have been in still an unfinished 
state in the time of Charles II. Near this castle, was fought what

was called a bloody battle, between Montrose and Argyle, in the 
year 1645. At that time, the population of Lochaber was enthu- 
siastically loyal to the unfortunate Charles. Argyle and an army 
of Covenanters went to Lochaber, to humble the adherents of the 
Royal cause, and in search of Montrose, who was with an army in 
the vicinity. Argyle's men appear to have committed some ex- 
cesses, and to have burned some houses, which roused the ire of 
John M'Donald, alias Ian Lom, the poet, who. set off, as is report- 
ed, to make his complaint, and to lay the grievances of his coun- 
try before Montrose. The Marquis was not disposed to give 
heed to the poet; but Alexander M'Donald, the son of Colkitto, 
who acted as second in command to Montrose, said, with an Irish 
oath, " I will go, and see what is wrong in M'Donald's country." 
Montrose gave him a wing of the army. They kept the ridge of 
the hill from Fort Augustus, where Ian Lom overtook them, to a 
farm on the braes of Lochaber, where Alexander M'Donald ex- 
pected to see the devastations described by Ian Lom. But no 
such devastations appearing, Ian Lom was considered as a spy, and 
was in danger of having his poetical career brought to a tragical end 
on a tree by the son of Colkitto, when he pleaded that they should 
go to the next farm, then at a short distance, and if they did not 
see his account verified, they might do with him as they pleased. 
Fortunately for Ian, the houses there were reduced to ashes; on 
seeing which, the son of Colkitto, with another Irish oath, said, 
" Ho° ho, the smell or track of the Badachs is here" Tha feu- 
leadhnam bodacha so. They then followed Ian Lom, who con- 
ducted them quietly to the foot of Bennevis at night. In the 
morning, Argyle's army, never dreaming that an army was near 
them, vvas attacked, and routed with great slaughter. Alexander 
M'Donald pursued the fugitives for six miles towards the head of 
Lochleven. And a stone was placed, which even at this day marks 
the spot where Montrose's men stopped from the pursuit of the 
Campbells. It is said that this stone still remains as a monument 
of Highland loyalty. 

At the east end of Lochlochy, another battle was fought between 
the Frasers and a branch of the M'Donalds. This skirmish took 
pUice on a hot day in summer, and the combatants on both sides 
stripped to their shirts. From this circumstance the battle was 
called la blar beine, or the battle of the shirts. The Frasers on 
that dav were almost all destroyed. 

The last feudal battle fought in Scotland between two Highland

factions was fought near Keppoch, in Uie centre of this parish, at 
a place called Muhay. The circumstances that led to this",bat- 
tle appear to have been the following. M'Intosh of M'Intosh 
possessed the lands of Keppoch, along with other lands in the vi- 
cinity. M'Ronald of Keppoch occupied this farm of Keppoch, as 
did his ancestors for many generations, partly by force, and partly 
by the connivance, and perhaps the weakness of the M'Intosh. 
M'Intosh would have been satisfied, it appears, with a slender ac- 
knowledgement of his superiority; but this M'Ronald had too much 
Highland spirit to yield. After various fruitless negociations, M'In- 
tosh was resolved to have recourse to the ultima ratio with his re- 
fractory vassal at Keppoch. He collected some hundreds of his clan, 
and, proposing to steal unawares on M'Ronald, he procured a com- 
pany of regular troops commanded by Captain M'Kenzie of Sud- 
dy, to aid him in his expedition. But M'Ronald, being apprised 
of his intentions, collected his own retainers, and met his feudal 
lord at the mouth of Glenroy. There at Mulray a most sangui- 
nary engagement took place. The M'Intoshes were routed ; and 
M'Intosh himself was taken prisoner. 

Eminent Men. — Ian Lom, already alluded to, resided in this 
parish. He had a poetical genius of a very high order. His songs 
translated into English would exhibit a striking picture of the period 
in which he lived. He was, however, a frenzied Jacobite. He was 
when a very youngman at the battle of Inverlochy in 1645, although 
he did not mingle in the conflict. It is asserted that the son of 
Colkitto said to him on the eve of the battle — " John, will you go 
with us" " No, I shall be a spectator of your prowess, and if you 
do well to-day, I will tell it as well as I can to your praise to-mor- 
row." He did so no doubt, and in the song he composed on the 
occasion, he luxuriates like a fiend on the anticipated music of the 
widows and orphans of the Campbells in Argyleshire weeping and 
clapping their hands in agony over the fate of their husbands and 
fathers. John survived the union of the two kingdoms, and compos- 
ed a song against the measure. In the intervening period, he was en- 
gaged in various exploits, some of which led to tragical results. It 
is reported that some one procured him the office of Gaelic Poet 
Laureate to King Charles H., — an office which, I believe, died with 
himself. We find John describe in a song the inarch of Dundee from 
Lochaber to Athole in the year 1689, the year after the Revolu- 
tion. He appears to have been present at the battle of Killie- 
, crankie, which he describes in a song, composed on the occasion, 



510 



TNVERNRSS-SHIRE. 



in such a manner as an eye-witness alone could describe it. He la- 
ments the slaughter of the M'Donalds by M'Kay's musketry at 
the commencement of the action ; and speaks in terms of bitter 
scorn of the cowardly expedient of blowing out heroes brains by 
such wretched missiles as leaden balls. He mentions also, that it 
was in the pursuit that Dundee was killed. 

Ian Lom's songs more powerfully influenced the minds of his 
countrymen than all the legislation which was at that time employ- 
ed for that purpose. Children were taught to" lisp them. They 
were sung in the family circle on long winter evenings, and at 
weddings, lykewakes, raffles, fairs, and in every company. They 
attributed to the Stewarts and their adherents the most exalted 
virtues; and the opponents of that family they represented as in- 
carnate fiends. 

In the year 1 745, the parish of Kilmonivaig, and that track of 
ground lying between its eastern boundaries, and the west coast, 
was called " the cradle of the rebellion." And this was the very 
locality where the songs of Ian Lom and other Jacobite bards were 
allowed to leaven the whole mass of society with Jacobite senti- 
ments. 

It may be stated here, that it was in this parish that the first 
act of rebellion was perpetrated in 1745, by an attack of the 
M'Donalds of Keppoch, on two companies of regular troops, 
which the rebels attacked, and took prisoners, after killing two of 
their men, and wounding their commander, Captain Scott, after- 
wards General Scott. After the Rebellion was suppressed, 
Charles Edward found shelter for some time in the sequestered 
glens of this parish, and some of the inhabitants experienced the 
tender mercies of the Duke of Cumberland. 

Parochial Registers. — There is a register of births and marriages, 
which commences in 1780. It was irregularly kept till the year 
1820. The Roman Catholic population seldom use this record 
for baptisms ; but most of their marriages are entered in it. There 
is also a minute-book kept by the kirk-session.

Glengarry, 850 ; total 2783. Number of families, 505. 

Five illegitimate births are recorded in the session-books in the 
course of the last three years. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — No improvements in agriculture have lately taken 
place in this parish, to any considerable extent. The respective 
quantities of arable and pasture land in these extensive bounds, it 
is impossible to state with accuracy. 

Manufactures. — There are no manufactures in the parish ex- 
cept that of whisky, at the Bennevis distillery, carried on by Mr 
John Macdonald. 

Fishings. — 'J'he salmon-fishings of the river Lochy are rented 
at L.320 per annum. They belong to Mr Scarlett. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — About one-half the population belongs to 
the Established Church,— the other half is Roman Catholic. 
Of Episcopalians there are two families. Stipend 18 chalders, 
half meal, half barley, with L.10 for communion elements. There 
is neither manse nor glebe j but for these there is an allowance 
from the heritors of L.70 per annum. 

There is a mission established on the Royal Bounty embracing 
the districts of Brae and Lochaber, in this parish, and Locharkaig, 
m Kilmalie. The missionary officiates in rotation, and as often 
as circumstances admit, at various stations within his bounds. 

Education.~There are three regular schools in the parish,— the 
parochial at Blarour,— the Assembly's school at Bunroy,— and the 
Society school at Invergarry. But, besides these, there are a few 
private schools got up among the people in the winter months.

Three or four more schools are required. The parochial school- 
master's salary is the maximum : and his fees do not exceed L. 5 
per annum. His other emoluments may amount to L. 4 per 
annum. The Assembly's school is singularly efficient, and a great 
blessing to the district. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is 35. Highest rate, 6s. 6d. ; lowest, L.2, 10s. per annum. The 
fund is supplied by church collections, amounting to about L. 10 
per annum. And there is occasionally a voluntary contribution 
of a few pounds per annum by the heritors.

PRESBYTERY OF INVERNESS, SYNOD OF MORAY. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Dunlichity, the larger, and probably the olderof these 
parishes, is so called from a high mountain or rather hill, at the 
bottom of which stands the church ; Dun-le-Catti, that is the hill 
which is in the middle of and bisects the territory of the Catti. The 
descendants of this ancient, numerous, and warlike people, under 
the various appellations of Mackintosh, Macgillivray, Macbean, 
Macqueen, Shaw, Macphail, Smith or Gow, Davidson, Clark, and 
others, who are all followers of Mackintosh of Mackintosh as their 
chief, and Captain of Clanchattaji, are at least nine to ten at this 
time, of the proprietors and possessors of land for a great tract on 
either side of this hill. On its summit is a large upright stone, 
called the " Watching Stone." There are also unequivocal marks 
of its having been used as a place of rendezvous, or for making sig- 
nals, according to the manner that prevailed among our ancestors 
in remote ages. 

Daviot or Davie is said to be a name given to this parish in me- 
mory of David Earl of Crawford, who built the fort or stronghold 
to be hereafter described. But, by the manner in which it is pro- 
nounced in Gaelic, this etymology seems forced and unnatural ; 
yet tradition has not preserved any other. 

Extent, Boundaries, c. — These parishes lie nearly south-west 
and north-east, on both sides of the river Nairn, and extend in 
length about 23 miles. Their greatest breadth of ground ave- 
rages from 4 to 5i miles, and their least scarcely one and a-half. 
They contain from eighty to ninety square miles. They are bound- 
ed on the south and east by the united parishes of Moy and Da- 
larossie ; on the west and north-west, by the parishes of Boleskine 
and Dores; on the north and north-east, by those of Inverness,

and Croy and Dalcross. Their boundaries and figure are very ir- 
regular. 

The hills which bound the south side of the parishes are one 
continued chain, and form the northern range of the Munadh 
Leugh mountains. They run south-west and north-east. Their 
height, upon an average, may be from 1000 to 2000 feet above 
the level of the sea. They are of easy access, and, with a few ex- 
ceptions, are generally flat or round at the top or summit. 

The parishes are bounded on the west and north-west by a rug- 
ged chain of hills for nearly eight miles, and which contain a se- 
ries of lakes partly forming the bounding line. These hills may 
be about 1500 or 1600 feet high. On the north and north-east, 
they are bounded by an inclined sandstone ridge commonly called 
Drimmashie or Drummossie moor, or the moor of Leys, at the 
east end of which the battle of Culloden was fought, in the parish 
of Daviot. This ridge or moor, in so far as it bounds these pa- 
rishes with those of Dores and Inverness, is from 800 to 900 feet 
above the level of the sea, at the latter place, and the roads to that 
town from'ihis district pass over that height. 

The valley of Strathnairn, which forms more than nine-tenths 
of the united parishes, is in figure, nearly though not quite, trian- 
gular, and extends from Wester Aberchalder, the property of 
Charles Mackintosh of Aberarder, at its south-western extremity, 
in a north-westerly direction, widening very considerably towards 
the middle, the chain of precipitous and rugged cliffs which con- 
stitutes a wall on the north side separating it from the parish of 
Dores, there suddenly breaking off, thence rapidly inclining to a 
point at the bridge of Daviot, on the Highland road, where the 
strath may be said to terminate in a very steep and narrow glen. 
A quarter of a mile below the bridge just mentioned, are situated 
the church and manse of Daviot, which, as well as the mansion- 
house of Daviot afterwards noticed, are entirely without the strath, 
and the parish continues for more than four miles further east- 
ward along the north bank of the river, to the breadth of nearly 
two miles. The last two miles of the parish, Culloden's lands, 
are from causes unnecessary to be here inquired to, accounted, as 
in a political sense, part of Nairnshire, although locally and geo- 
graphically altogether detached from that shire. It is only quoad 
juridica that this proportion of the parish is comprehended with- 
in the county last named. The inhabitants are indeed subjected 
to great and needless inconvenience and expense by their being

under the necessity of repairing to the Sheriff-court of Nairn, a 
distance of nearly thirteen miles, when they have any judicial busi- 
ness to transact, instead of going to Inverness, which lies not more 
than five or six miles distant from the most remote north-easterly 
point of the parish. 

The property of Dunmaglass, in the south-western corner of 
the parish of Dunlichity, holds a still more anomalous kind of con- 
nection with the county of Nairn. 

About the church of Daviot, and for two miles to the west, on 
both sides of the valley, are a great many sand-hills, which appear 
evidently to have been formed at some very remote period by the 
currents of contrary tides, and by the flux and reflux of some great 
body of water. They are from 600 to 630 feet above the level of 
the sea. 

Hydrography. — There are a great many small springs ; some 
intermittent and perennial. There are four lakes or lochs in the 
parishes, viz. Lochs Ruthven, Coire, Duntelchaig, and Clachan. 
Only one-half of Lochs Ruthven and Duntelchaig is in the 
united parishes, their other half being in the parish of Dores. 

The river Nairn, until within a recent period, known by the 
humble denomination of the water of Nairn, is the only one in the 
district. It rises in the south-west part of the parish of Dunlichi- 
ty, and runs north-east. Its length, from its source at Cairn Gre- 
gor, until it falls into the Moray Frith, at the town of Nairn, 
including its windings, is about thirty-six miles. Its breadth and 
depth is not great, but, at the time of a speat or flood, it flows 
with considerable velocity, overflows its banks, and thereby creating 
much damage to the lands and crops. 

Geology.-— '"YVe. strata and beds in the hills run from south-west 
to north-east, upon both sides of the valley of the Nairn. They 
are principally of gray gneiss, but large blocks of white granite are 
found loose upon the tops and sides of most of them. Upon the 
plains and low grounds are to be seen conglomerate or pudding- 
stone of the old red sandstone formation, associated with a black 
and blue bituminous shale. There are also to be found blocks of 
red and gray granite, the latter of a most durable quality and beau- 
tiful description. 

Several years ago, limestone was discovered a little below the 
mains of Daviot, in the bed, and on both sides of the river Nairn. 
The mass contained many metallic cubes of galena or lead glance.

INVERNESS-SIIIRE. 



of from one-eighth to one-fourth of an inch or more. This lime- 
stone has not been wrought. 

An extensive bed of marl has lately been discovered by Colonel 
Mackintosh of Farr, in the moss of Fordarroch, the property of 
Mackintosh of Mackintosh, from five to seven feet below the sur- 
face, and the bed is from five to six feet deep. It lies upon the 
south bank of Loch Bunachton, which bounds the parishes for 
nearly a mile on the north. The marl has been used upon light 
soils, and has answered uncommonly well. 

Botamj. — Maiden-hair, tussiliigo, wild mint, betony, St John's 
wort, lichen, tansy, foxglove, thyme, valerian, burdock, hemlock, 
trefoil, nettle, fern, and dock, are all medicinal plants found here, 
and used by the country people. 

The oldest plantations are from fifty to seventy years of age, 
and are of the common Scots fir, interspersed with a few larches. 
These were planted by William Mackintosh, father of the late 
Captain William Mackintosh of Aberarder, the late James Mack- 
intosh of Farr, and Colonel John Macgillivray, brother of the 
late Captain William Macgillivray of Dunmaglass. These gen- 
tlemen were the first who attempted planting or any other improve- 
ment in the country, and their example was followed by the late 
David Davidson of Cantry at FHchity, and by the deceased Ro- 
bert Macbean of Culclachie. These plantations extend to about 
1020 acres. 

Scots fir, larch, ash, oak, and beech, seem adapted to the soil, 
and thrive uncommonly well. We have natural fir and larch grow- 
ing from the seed of the older trees. 

The external appearance of the country is not very inviting, and 
must seem rather wild and romantic to a stranger. 

II. — Civil History. 
About the year 1532, the Earl of Moray, being at variance with 
the Mackintoshes, and Clanchattan in Petty, Strathdearn, and 
Strathairn, for overthrowing the fort of Dyke, and besieging the 
Castle of Darnaway, and committing many spoils and burnings in 
his Lordship's country, all which they did under the command of 
Hector Mackintosh, the bastard, and his natural brother, Wil- 
liam, who acted as Captain of Clanchattan during the minority 
of the young chief ; — he obtained a commission from the King to 
jiroceed against them ; but, upon the pretence of holding one of 
his feudal courts, he assembled the Clanchattan from the dis- 
tricts above-mentioned at Tordarroch in the parish of Dun-

lichity, where in one day he had 200 of them hanged in a 
barn ; but William, after his death, was quartered, and a quarter 
sent to Elgin, Forres, Aberdeen, and Inverness, and his head to 
Dyke, to be fastened upon a pole, all as an example to others. 
None of these 200 could be induced to confess where their Cap- 
tain Hector was, although life was severally promised to every one 
of them, as they were led along to the gallows. This was called 
the Raid of Petty. 

On the 16th March 1746, a month before the battle of Cul- 
loden, Lord Loudon with the King's army was at Inverness, and 
understood that Prince Charles Stuart was to sleep that night at 
Moyhall, the seat of the laird of Mackintosh, which is eleven 
miles south of that town, with a guard of 200 of Mackintosh's men 
attending him. His Lordship, with 1500 of his men, proceeded 
immediately to Moyhall, in order to take the Prince by surprise, 
and thereby to put a speedy end to the rebellion. Mackintosh 
himself was absent in Ross-shire in the King's service, but his 
lady, who was a daughter of Farquharson of Invercauld, entertain- 
ed the Prince, and was so enthusiastic in his cause that she raised 
a regiment of her husband's clan and followers to support him. 
She got private information in the forenoon of that day, of the 
intended advance of the King's forces, and having consulted with 
Donald Fraser, blacksmith at Moybeg, a clever and active man, he 
agreed to go along with five other men whom she named, to re- 
connoitre the royal army along the high road to Inverness. 
Donald having armed himself and his party, lost no time in pro- 
ceeding upon their expedition. It was in the dusk of the even- 
ing when they reached the pass at the hill of Craig-an-oin, at 
the boundary of the parish of -Daviot with that of Moy. Here 
there was a quantity of feal and divot set up to dry. Donald 
and his men, in order to watch the motions of the enemv, placed 
themselves a few hundred yards asunder, amongst these heaps ; 
soon afterwards they perceived Loudon's troops coming forward, 
and when the army came within hearing, a command was passed 
by Donald, and then from man to man, in a loud voice, along a dis- 
tance of nearly a quarter of a mile, " the Mackintoshes, Macgil- 
livrays, and Macbeans to form instantly the centre, the Macdonalds 
on the right and the Frasers on the left," — all this in the hearing 
of the commander-in-chief of the Royal army. Fraser and his party 
fired a few shots, when a soldier of the advanced guard was 
killed. Lord Loudon, suspecting in the twilight that the heaps

above-noticed were the Highland army, and that the whole 
of the Prince's forces were ready to attack him, instantly faced 
to the right about in great confusion, and retreated with the ut- 
most expedition to Inverness ; and, not thinking himself safe 
there, he continued his route across three arms of the sea to 
Sutherlandshire, a distance of seventy miles, where he took up his 
quarters. This affair was humorously called the rout of Moy. 

The greater part of the moor upon which the battle of CuUo- 
den was fought on the 16th of April 1746, and the spot where 
the Prince stood during the engagement, a little to the north-west 
of the farm-house of Culchinnock, lie in the parish of Daviot. 

After the Prince's defeat at CuUoden, he left the field with a 
few attached friends, crossed the river Nairn above the mains of 
Daviot, passed by Tordarroch, and proceeded to Gorthleck in 
Stratherrick. 

Land-owners. — The land-holders and only heritors in the pa- 
rishes are seven in number, viz. 1. John Lachlan Macgillivray of

Parochial Registers. — The earliest date in the parochial regis- 
ter one small volume is 1774, and until the year 1820 the re- 
cord was kept very irregularly. The former registers were de- 
stroyed, in consequence of the school-house, in which they were 
kept, having been burnt by accident. 

Antiquities. — At the Mains of Daviot, a seat of the ancestors of 
the present laird of Mackintosh, there still remains a small por- 
tion of the ruins of a fort or castle, which is said to have been 
built by David, Earl of Crawford, in the beginning of the fifteenth 
century. This was, in these days, a place of great strength, being 
situated at the extremity of the sand-hills already noticed. It had 
a dry ditch and drawbridge, which separated and secured it from 
approach by the level ground on the west, and a strong wall on 
the other sides, where the height and natural declivity of the hill 
added much to its security. It was a square building, and enclos- 
ed an area of 360 yards ; had four circular towers, one in every 
corner, and containing three stories, all vaulted. It had secret 
passages in the middle of the wall, communicating with the large 
vaulted rooms for the main guard at the principal entry. It was 
a stately edifice, and commanded a very extensive prospect. The

walls and towers, excepting a small breach at the main gate, were 
all entire about eighty-four years ago ; and, had they suffered no 
injury besides natural decay, might have remained for centuries 
as a specimen of the superior skill of our ancient masonry. In 
the year 1784, a wadset was obtained from the laird of Mack- 
intosh of the lands of Daviot, where the castle stood ; and 
it is much to be regretted, that, in a country where stones are so 
plentiful as to be an incumbrance, this noble and only monument 
of antiquitity should have been partly destroyed for furnishing ma- 
terials to a modern farm-house and offices. Still, however, a 
magnificent ruin remained ; but it must shock the feelings of every 
person of taste, to be told that its total destruction was gradually 
accomplished during a period of forty years prior to 1794, for no 
other purpose than that of procuring the old lime and rubbish for 
the possessor's dung- hill. 

On the west, and close to the manse of Daviot, is a hill, round 
at the top, called Dun-Daviot, which appears to have been a sig- 
nal-post in former limes, and seems to have formed a lineof tele- 
graphic communication betwixt Dun-Evan, near Calder, on the east, 
and Dun-Dardil, on Loch Ness side, on the west, and Craig Pha- 
dric, near Inverness, on the north. 

There are the remains of several Druidical temples in the pa- 
rishes. Those in the most perfect state are to be seen at Daviot, 
Gask, Tordarroch, and Farr. Various tumuli have been opened, 
and a stone-coffin was found in the centre of each of them, con- 
taining ashes ; in a few, there were empty urns. 

On the west side of the small hill called Tork, in the parish of 
Dunlichity, is Chapel field, where, it is said, the parish church or 
chapel stood before it was transferred to Dunlichity. At this spot 
are still to be seen a number of graves, which are marked out by 
small round stones. 

Modern Buildings. — Within the last twenty years, the following 
buildings have been erected, viz. the commodious mansion-house 
of Daviot, by the late Alexander Mackintosh of Mackintosh ; an 
elegant and large addition to the House of Farr, by Colonel Mack- 
intosh ; the church of Daviot, Episcopal chapel at Croachy of 
Aberarder ; and the two parochial school-houses ; the three farm- 
steadings, with thrashing-mills, at Culclachie, Daviot, and Farr, 
with several tenants' houses. The whole are built of stone and 
lime, and are also slated.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are about 4000 acres, standard imperial 
measure, which are cultivated or occasionally in tillage. There 
are from 1400 to 1500 acres of waste land, or in pasture, which 
might, with a profitable application of capital, be added to the 
cultivated land, if that land was to be afterwards kept in occasion- 
al tillage or in permanent pasture. We have no undivided com- 
mon in the parishes. There are about 830 acres of natural wood, 
and of old and new plantations upwards of 2270 acres. 

The average rent of arable land per acre is L.l Sterling. 

The soil in these parishes varies much, being in some places 
sandy and light, in others spongy and wet, with a clay bottom. In 
some, it is of a black mossy nature; and in many, a composition of 
all these. Barley and white oats have answered well ; but black 
oats and rye were formerly in use, and still continue to be so in a 
few places. 

The progress of agriculture, as has been shown, was but very 
indifferently attended to at the date of the last Statistical Account 
of the parishes, and for several years thereafter. By the industry 
and exertions of the following gentlemen, it has now, however, at- 
tained a higher character in that respect than it formerly main- 
tained. In the year 1808, Lachlan Mackintosh of Raigmore, 
who had previously purchased the estate of Culclachie, having 
returned from India, very soon thereafter commenced a series of 
improvements, by planting, enclosing, draining, and liming, and 
has added upwards of 100 acres of arable land to the estate, which 
was formerly but waste land and swampy ground. He carried on 
a regular rotation of crops, with a fair return ; and was the first who 
attempted to raise wheat in the parish of Daviot, in which his 
estate lies. The late Alexander Mackintosh of Mackintosh hav- 
ing taken up his residence at Daviot, in the year 1821, follow- 
ed the same example, in prosecuting extensive improvements in 
that quarter, by adopting a regular system of farming. In 1823, 
Colonel Mackintosh of Farr returned from India, and has since 
that period been continually engaged in the improvement of his 
property, by cultivating waste land, planting, inclosing, draining, 



DAVIOT AND DUNLICHITY. 



521 



and liming, and carrying forward a proper rotation of husbandry. 
He was the first to raise wheat in the parish of Dunlichity. 

Some of these gentlemen, and one or two of the other proprie- 
tors, have given encouraging leases to some of their tenantry, who 
are now following the example of the above spirited gentlemen, 
by draining and liming. Earthen embankments, or flow-dikes, as 
they are usually called, have also been made to a considerable ex- 
tent along the river Nairn ; by which means a great quantity of 
land which it overflowed in time of speat, is now preserved, and 
the crops rendered safe and secure. 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The royal burgh of Inverness is the port and 
market-town to which the produce is sent for sale, distant from 
some part of the parishes from five to twenty miles. 

Means of Communication. — The parish of Dunlichity and part 
of Daviot enjoy a good district road to Inverness. In the east end 
of the parish of Daviot, the Great Highland Road, from Perth to 
Inverness, passes through it for nearly three miles, upon which 
there is one toll-bar in the parish. The Highland coach, from 
Inverness to Perth, travels on this road. The Inverfarigag road, 
under the charge of the Parliamentary Commissioners, formed 
about twenty-four years ago, branches off" from the Great High- 
land Road, near to the church of Daviot, runs through the pa- 
rishes to the westward for nearly thirteen miles, and continues on 
through the parish of Boleskine to Inverfarigag Pier at Lochness, 
a distance of six and a half miles. 

The bridges in the district are kept in good order, and the 
fences are in proper condition, but frequently injured by the 
sheep in winter. 

Ecclesiastical State. — These parishes were distinct and separate 
charges until about the year 1618, when they were united ; and 
there is still a parochial church and glebe in each. Neither of 
these glebes is of the legal extent, — and upon that of Dunlichity 
an encroachment was made, many years ago, by the building of a 
meal-mill, and making a water-lead to it, which cannot now be re- 
moved. The distance between the two churches is computed to 
be seven miles. The church of Daviot is four miles from the east 
end, and that of Dunlichity, about twelve miles from the west end 
of the parishes. Public worship is alternately performed in each 
church every Lord's Day, but only at Dunlichity in winter when 
the weather permits.

INVERNESS-SHIRE. 



The church of Daviotwas rebuilt in 1826, and cost very nearly 
L.lOOO Sterling. It is seated for 500 persons, and the seats are di- 
vided among the heritors in proportion to the valued rent of their 
estates. The manse was built in 1763. It and the office -houses 
have since had several repairs, the last of which was in 1824. 

The church of Dunlichity was rebuilt in 1759, and contains 
only 300 persons. The seats are divided, as already mentioned. 
It has had several repairs, the last in 1826 ; and it is said that the 
present is only the third church which has been built in that place. 

The church-yards are enclosed with substantial stone walls, and 
a night watch-house has been erected in each. The extent of the 
glebe at Daviot is from 4 to 5 acres arable, and 12 pasture ; that 
of Dunlichity is about 3 acres arable, and nearly 4 of pasture. 
The stipend, as fixed in 1814, is 12 chalders, half meal, half bar- 
ley. In 1781, it was L.52, 6s.; but, in 1784, there was an aug- 
mentation of L.25, no part whereof was victual. 

The number of families attending the Estabhshed Church is 
about 450. The average number of communicants at the Esta- 
blished Church, in both parishes, is 45. The Episcopalians have 
a chapel, where one of their clergymen preaches once in three or 
four weeks, and administers the sacrament four times in the year, 
after the manner prescribed by the English ritual. They general- 
ly attend our public worship when they have none themselves, and 
are personally acquainted with the minister. There are several 
Seceders in these parishes. The whole number of Roman Catholics 
is three women, who have come lately from other districts. They 
are married to Protestants, and attend our church. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools in the parishes, 
— one at the manse of Daviot, and the other near Dunlichity. 
There is one also at Croachy of Aberarder, supported by the So- 
ciety for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and by the proprietor 
of the estate of Aberarder. The salary of each parochial school- 
master is L.25 per annum ; and the school fees amount to L.8 
or L.IO for each. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the ses- 
sion roll for both parishes is from 45 to 50, among whom there is 
distributed the sum of L. 15 yearly; which sum arises partly 
from the interest of L. 52 mortified money, from the collec- 
tions made at the churches, and partly from penalties inflicted 
upon delinquents. But, out of these penalties, certain fees are 



DAVIOT AND DUNLICHITY. 



523 



paid to the session-clerk and kirk-officer, amounting to L .2 or 
thereby annually. 

The late William Macgillivray, tenant in Ballonortan of Aber- 
chalder, mortified, in 1833, the sum of L.400 Sterling, the yearly 
interest of which is to be applied to the poor in the following pro- 
portions, viz. one-fourth to the poor on the estate of Aberchalder, 
and the remainder exclusively to the poor of the parish of Dunli- 
chity. Part of this interest is at present under liferent. 

Captain William Mackintosh of the Hindostan Indiaman, 
youngest son of Angus Mackintosh of Farr, and born in this dis- 
trict, bequeathed in 1803, L. 10,000, now upwards of L. 26,000 
Sterling, the interest of which to be applied in the education at 
the Inverness Academy, of the boys of four families of the name 
of Mackintosh, viz. Farr, Holm, Dalmigavie and Killachy, or 
their nearest of kin, of that name.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1247390">INVERNESS</name>.</head> 
<p>


Inverness-shire is one of the largest counties of Scotland, 
extending, from north-east to south-west, 85 miles, and from 
north-west to south-east, about 55 miles. 

It is bounded on the south, by Argyleshire ; on the north, by 
Ross-shire ; on the east, by Banff and Aberdeenshires ; and ex- 
tends on the west to the Atlantic Ocean, including, in this direc- 
tion, several of the Western Islands. The whole area of the 
county is computed at 4600 square miles, or 2,944,000 acres, 
500,000 of which are under cultivation. A chain of salt and 
fresh-water lochs, in the line of the Caledonian Canal, intersects 
the county from south to north, forming Glen More, or the Great 
Glen of Scotland ; and the river Ness, rising out of the loch of 
the same name, and, after traversing a very short space of country, 
empties its waters into the Moray Frith. The greater part of the 
county is extremely mountainous, consisting of heath and pasture 
land; the fertile and arable portions being in the glens and valleys. 
The county is naturally portioned out into several of these glens 
or districts ; such as Lochaber,on the south, adjoining Argyleshire; 
Glen Garry, Glen Morriston, Glen Urquhart, Glenelg, to the west- 
ward of the Caledonian Canal; Arisaig, Moydart, and Strathglass, 
to the north ; and on the east. Glen Roy, Badenoch, and the 
valley of the Spey. Most of these valleys and districts are watered 
by their respective streams. 

The extensive Island of Skye, the Harris, Benbecula, North 
and South Uist, Barra, part of Lewis, and some other small islands 
are included in this county. 

The principal inland lochs are, Loch Ness, Loch Oich, Loch 
Lochy, Loch Arkig, Loch Laggan. 



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



525 



The southern and western shores of the county are indented 
with numerous arms of the sea, which also receive the name of 
lochs; as Loch Sunart, Loch Shiel, Loch Morren, Loch Nevish, 
Loch Hourn. 

The highest mountain is Ben Nevis. 

The geological structure of the greater part of the county is of 
primary rocks, consisting chiefly of gneiss and mica-slate, with 
granite, porphyry, and trap-rocks. The lower division of the 
county, bordering the Moray Frith, and extending along the bor- 
ders of Loch Ness to the south, and to Beauly on the west, is 
composed of old red-sandstone ; the eastern part of Skye, next 
the mainland, is also composed of similar strata,- the western 
portion, consisting of trap-rocks, and the newer oolitic and lias 
formations. The most fertile portion of the county is that where 
the red-sandstone prevails, which consists of the valley of the Aird, 
extending from Inverness to Beauly. 

Inverness is thecapitalof the county, and isbeautifully situated on 
the banks of the Ness. The population of the county, according to 
the census of 1841, is 97,615 ; the Parliamentary constituency, 809. 
Although the county covers a great extent of ground, and con- 
tains a considerable number of inhabitants, yet, besides Inverness 
and Beauly, there are no other towns or even villages of any consi- 
derable magnitude, the inhabitants being chiefly agricultural and 
pastoral ; and thus living in a detached manner, the Gaelic language 
is universally, and, in some remote situations, exclusively spoken ; 
and in the remote glens and secluded defiles of the mountains, 
the ancient manners and feelings of the Celts still linger and are 
cherished. 

The rearing of black-cattle and sheep forms the chief occupa- 
tion of the inhabitants of the mountain districts. Sea-fishino-, and 
especially the herring, fishery, engages the attention of the nlitives 
of the western shores, and agriculture is sedulously pursued in the 
Aird and other favourable situations throughout the county. 

The county returns one Member to Parliament. 

The annual value of real property in the county, as assessed in 
1815, amounted to L. 185,565.

PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER STEWART, MINISTER.  



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Situation, Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish of Cromarty lies in the 
extreme eastern angle of the old shire of that name, — abutting, on 
the south and west, on the parishes of Rosemarkie and Resolis ; and 
on the north and east, on the Cromarty and Moray Friths. It is 
of an irregularly oblong figure, averaging from 5 to 7 miles in 
length, and from 2 to 3 in breadth. On the east, it presents to 
the waves of the Moray Frith an abrupt and lofty wall of preci- 
pices ; and attains in this direction to its highest elevation, of about 
470 feet above the level of the sea, at a distance of little more 
than 500 yards from the shore. On the north and west it sweeps 
gently towards the Frith of Cromarty ; but sinks abruptly over the 
beach into a steep continuous bank, which, from the shells occa- 
sionally dug up at its base, seems at some early period to have 
formed the coast line. There now intervenes, however, in most 
places, a lower terrace between it and the shore. Viewed from 
the north, the parish presents a bold high outline, — rising towards 
the east, where it marks the junction of the Cromarty and Moray 
Friths, like a huge leviathan out of the sea, and descending to- 
wards the west into a long rectilinear ridge, of the character so pe- 
culiar to sandstone districts. An irregularly edged stripe of fir 
wood covers, for about six miles, the upper line ; a broad arable 
belt mottled with cottages and farm-steadings occupies the decli- 
vity ; while the terrace below, — near the eastern extremity of which 
the town is situated, and which, like the upper belt, is mostly ara- 
ble, — advances in some places on the sea in the form of low pro- 
montories, and is scooped out in others to nearly the base of the 
escarpment. 

Name. — The parish is said to owe its name {Cromba, i. e. crook- 

" Drawn up by Mr Hugh Miller, Author of" Scenes and Legends of the North 
of Scotland."

ed bay to the windings and indentations of its shores. It is 
surrounded by a highly picturesque country ; and is rich in pros- 
pects which combine the softer beauties of the lowlands with the 
bolder graces peculiar to an alpine district. 

Climate. — In climate, the parish differs considerably from most 
of the adjacent country. The entrance of the Frith is guarded 
by two lofty headlands about a mile apart ; and during the warm- 
er months, there sets in at noon a cool sea-breeze, which some- 
times hardly ruffles the water for more than half a mile beyond 
the opening, and rarely extends for more than five miles within. 
It seems occasioned by the rarefaction of the warmer air in the 
Ulterior, and the compression of the denser current, — rushing in 
to restore the equilibrium, — in the narrow entrance of the Frith. 
The average heat of summer is, in consequence, lower than in most 
of the neighbouring parishes. I have observed that the acorn 
rarely attains the ordinary size, and almost never ripens. But the 
winters are moderate ; it is no uncommon occurrence to find our 
gooseberry bushes in full blossom at Christmas ; and in no part 
of Scotland do trees flourish nearer the sea. The parish is rare- 
ly visited in the summer months by fever, — an effect, it is probable, 
of the cool ventilating breeze ; and though the keen damp air is 
found to bear heavy on persons affected by pulmonary complaints 
or rheumatism, the inhabitants in general are a robust healthy 
race, and many of them attain to extreme old age. There is at 
present residing in the town, a woman who was employed in tend- 
ing a flock of sheep on the day of Culloden, and who still retains 
a vivid recollection of her terror on hearing the cannon ; and there 
died in it in one season, about seventeen years ago, three old men, 
the first of whom had completed his ninetieth, the second his hun- 
dredth, and the third his hundredth and first year. 

Bays, Springs, Cascades. — The bay of Cromarty was deemed one 
of the finest in the world, at a time when the world was very imper- 
fectly known, and modern discovery seems to have done nothing to 
lower its character. Almost all the black-letter historians dwell 
upon it in their quaint and impressive language, as the very para- 
gon of harbours. Stow in his Chronicles characterizes it as " an 
exceeding quiet and saue hauen." Boece eulogizes it in his preli- 
minary book as the hail health of seamen ; and it has been de- 
scribed by Buchanan in elegant and graphic Latin, showing us 
that the poet was not wholly sunk in the historian, as " formed by 
the waters of the German Ocean, opening a way through the stu- 
pendous cliffs of the most lofty pi-ecipices, and expanding within

into a spacious basin, affording certain refuge against every tem- 
pest." As described by the historian, the entrance is narrow; 
the headlands lofty and precipitous, and so exposed to the sea, 
that it is not uncommon during gales from the north-east to see 
waves breaking upon them to the height of fully 100 feet ; but so 
completely sheltered is the basin within, that froth most points of 
view it presents the appearance of a lake. In breadth it varies 
from 2 to rather more than 5 miles; its length is about 18; the 
depth averages from 9 to 12 fathoms, but in the entrance in some 
places it exceeds 30, — a depth which nearly doubles that of the 
frith into which it opens. It has frequently been described by sea- 
faring men, who are universally acquainted with it, and who rarely 
speak of it without an enthusiasm, the result of many a grateful as- 
sociation, as sufficiently capacious to shelter the whole British 
navy. Most of the springs of the parish are of a petrifying quali- 
ty. The water of nearly all the draw-wells deposit inside our tea- 
kettles, in the course of a few years, a crust of lime fully a quarter 
of an inch thick; and some of our rock springs are so largely charged 
with this earth, as frequently to block up their older channels, and 
burst out in new ones, which are to be choked up in turn. There 
is one little spring which moistens a stripe of precipice not more than 
a yard in breadth, which yet, by this process of shifting, has covered 
an extent of at least twenty yards with coral-like petrifactions of 
moss and lichens, intermingled with grass and nettle stalks, and 
with a hard breccia, which, more enduring than the rock on the edge 
of which it has formed, projects over like a cornice, for nearly four 
feet. There are no rivers in the parish, and the streams are mere 
runnels ; but there is one of these the burn of Ethie which from 
its cascades, and the beauty of its scenery, is highly deserving of 
notice. It forms the extreme boundary of the parish towards the 
south, and runs for the last two miles of its course through a nar- 
row precipitous gulf of great depth, which seems to have been 
scooped, by some frightful convulsion, out of an immense bed of 
sandstone, which in this part of the parish attains to an elevation 
of above 250 feet above the level of the sea. The traveller ad- 
vances a few yards along the course of the stream, and finds that 
he is shut in from almost the entire face of nature, and from the 
whole works of man. A line of mural precipices rises on either 
hand, — here advancing in gigantic columns like those of an Egyptian 
temple, — there receding into deep solitary recesses, tapestried with 
ivy, and darkened by birch and hazel. The cliffs vary their outlines

at every step, as if assuming in succession all the various combina- 
tions of form which constitute the wild and the picturesque ; and 
the pale yellow hue of the stone seems, when brightened by the sun, 
the very tint a painter would choose to heighten the effect of his 
shades, or to contrast most delicately with the luxuriant profusion 
of bushes and flowers that wave over every shelf and cranny. A 
colony of swallows have built, from time immemorial, in the hollows 
of one of the loftiest precipices. As the traveller proceeds, the 
dell becomes wilder and more deeply wooded, the stream frets and 
toils at his feet, here leaping over an opposing ridge, there strug- 
gling in a pool, yonder escaping to the light from under some frag- 
ment of cliff: There is a richer profusion of flowers, a thicker mant- 
ling of ivy and honeysuckle, and after passing a semicircular inflec- 
tion of the bank, which, waving from summit to base with birch and 
hawthorn, may remind one of some vast amphitheatre on the morn- 
ing of a triumph, he finds the passage shut up by a perpendicular 
wall of rock, about thirty feet in height, over which the stream pre- 
cipitates itself in a slender column of foam into a dark mossy basin. 
A little cluster of hazels fling their arms half-way across, — trebling 
with their shade the apparent depth of the pool, and heightening 
in an equal ratio the effect of the white flicker of the cascade, and 
of the little bright patches of foam, which, flung from the rock, 
incessantly revolve on the eddy. The entire scene is exquisitely 
wild and picturesque, — such a one as the painter would love to 
transfer to his canvas, and the man of taste delight to contemplate ; 
but a larger body of water is wanting to raise it to the dignity of 
the sublime. There are two other cascades, scarcely inferior in 
beauty, in the upper part of the dell. 

Geology. — The eastern corner of the parish, which, from its 
superior elevation, bears the name of the hill of Cromarty, is com- 
posed of an immense primary mass of granitic gneiss, partially vein- 
ed with white quartz, and lined, in some places where it bounds 
on the Moray Frith, with huge blocks of hornblende. The strata 
are much twisted and broken, as if shattered by earthquakes when 
passing under the influence of extreme heat from a solid to a fluid 
state, and in many places they assume a nearly vertical position. 
•The precipices of the hill are of great height, rising perpendicu- 
larly nearly an hundred yards above the shore, and they abound in 
caverfis, which add much to the wildness of the scenery, and pre- 
sent us in several places with picturesque and highly uncommon 
combinations of form. In the gorge of a deep precipitous chasm

CROMARTY.

about two miles to the east of the town, there is a natural arch 
which yields a narrow and doubtful passage to what would have 
been otherwise an insulated pile of rock, at the height of about an 
hundred feet over the beach. A second pile of rock, which stands 
out of the sea like the ruins of an inundated temple, is perforated 
by no fewer than four natural arches, one of which is about forty 
feet in span ; and there is a cave near the extreme angle of the 
hill, which runs so deep into the rock, that at its inner extremity 
the light of the opening is hardly seen to glimmer along the hoar 
and dewy sides, — crusted with hardening moss, and ridged with 
stalactites ; and the objects beyond seem as if viewed through the 
tube of a telescope. The granitic gneiss extends over a space of 
about three square miles. The rest of the parish, which is 
secondary, is variously composed of sandstones, argillaceous 
shales, breccia, and minute veins of lime ; and the angle of the 
strata averages in most places from about twenty to thirty, except 
in the neighbourhood of the hill, where, like that of the granitic 
mass, it is nearly vertical. The older sandstone formations He in 
this direction, — the more recent towards the west ; and between 
these, there intervene beds of a stratified clay, which seem in this 
part of the country, like the carboniferous shales of Caithness, to 
represent the coal measures of the south. They abound in ani- 
mal remains of an obscure but highly interesting class. In a little 
bay about three hundred yards to the east of the town, where the 
beds have been laid bare by the sea, and in which they assume a 
nearly horizontal position, we find their softer clays partially co- 
vered with nodules of a firmer texture, which, from their detached 
and rounded appearance, resemble floats of broken ice on a lake. 
Each of these, even the most minute, contains the remains of 
some animal,— plates resembling those of the tortoise, pieces of 
skin roughened like that of the dog-fish or shark, the scales and 
bones of fish ; and in some of the better specimens we can still 
trace the original form, with the fins and tail spread to the full, 
and the scales as regularly arranged as when they covered the liv- 
ing animal. The clays of the little bay, after losing themselves in 
the beach, reappear in the bottom of a deep ravine which inter- 
sects the old coast Hne; and here, rather more than a century ago, 
they were perforated to a considerable depth in boring for coal. 
But the attempt was unsuccessful. On withdrawing the kind of 
augre used for the purpose, a bolt of water, which occupied the 
whole diameter of the bore, came rushing after like the jet of a

fountain, and the work was prosecuted no farther ; for, as steam 
engines were not yet invented, no pit could have been wrought 
with so large a stream issuing into it. The spring, a fine chaly- 
beate, still continues to flow between its double row of cresses to 
the sea, at the rate, as was ascertained by experiment about twenty 
years ago, of nearly a hogshead per minute. A little dome of hewn 
stone has been raised over it, and, with the wooded ravine in the 
back ground, and surrounded by trees and bushes, it would form, in 
the hands of Turner, no bad subject for a vignette. It is still 
known to the towns-people as " The well of the Coalhcugh," a 
name commemorative of its origin. 

The eastern part of the parish presents a highly interesting 
field to the geologist. A few hundred yards beyond where it 
bounds on the Moray Frith, there is a ridge of bituminous 
shale interspersed with beds and nodules of limestone, which 
abound in the various fossils peculiar to the lias formation. 
The ridge itself is covered by the waters of the Frith, but after 
every fresh storm from the north-east, we find fragments which the 
waves have detached from it strewed upon the beach. They 
contain ammonites, belemnites, scallops, both plain and striated, 
pieces of wood and charcoal, and the fleshy leaf of a plant re- 
sembling the aloe. The boulders and water-worn pebbles which 
line the shores of the parish, and abound in its alluvial clays and 
gravels, are composed mostly of schistose gneiss, and a variety of 
granite, of which no rocks are to be found nearer than the western 
coast of Ross-shire. The rounded and half-polished masses of 
the latter stone are often of immense size, containing many 
hundred cubic feet ; and they seem to have been carried across 
the island in the direction of the larger valleys, by some irresistible 
flood setting in from the west. In most places, the subsoil of the 
parish is a stiff" alluvial clay, which, on the edge of the old coast- 
line, overlies the sandstone to the depth of nearly an hundred feet, 
but it thins off" in the ascent to not more than ten. It yields easily 
to the action of water, and hence we find that every little stream 
in the parish has scooped out a channel for itself to the sandstone 
below, and runs at the bottom of a deep narrow dell, lined in 
most cases by steep precipitous banks. 

Mosses, Fuel. — A short half mile to the east of the town, in an 
inflection of the bank, there is a vast accumulation of drift peat 
covered over by a layer of soil. Somewhat more than thirty years 
ago, it was laid open by a waterspout to the depth of twelve feet, 



CROMARTY. 



7 



when it was first discovered to be composed mostly of vegetable 
remains, — part of the ruins, perhaps, of one of those forests which 
covered at one time almost the entire surface of the island, and 
sheltered the naked inhabitants from the legions of Agricola. 
Huge trees from two to four feet in diameter, and so entirely de- 
cayed that they offered scarcely more resistance to the tool than 
banks of common clay, were seen to stretch across the bottom of 
the newly formed chasm, or to protrude from its sides. The soil in 
which they were imbedded is a black solid peat moss, composed 
mostly of bark and branches ; and in masses of a fetid unctuous 
earth, which seems endowed with a stronger preservative quality 
than even the moss itself, there were found the leaves of plants so 
little decayed that the species could still be distinguished, stalks 
of what seemed to have been either grass or straw, and whole 
handfuls of hazel nuts. It is not yet four years since there were 
dug out of the sides of the chasm, about nine feet from the sur- 
face, three huge oaken planks, which had evidently been fashioned 
by the hand of man ; and in the bottom, which is now fast filling up, 
there were found, about fourteen years before, fragments of the bones 
and horns of deer, and the horn of an elk. In the upper part of the 
parish, there was a much more extensive moss, which, before the 
opening of the coal trade with Newcastle, supplied the place with 
fuel, but it gradually wore out, and the poorer part of the people 
were subjected in consequence to much hardship during severe win- 
ters. " A Cromarty fire" was a name current over the country for a 
fire just gone out ; and some humorist of the period represents a 
Cromarty farmer in a phrase which became proverbial, as giving 
his daughter the key of the peat-chest, and bidding her take out a 
peat and a-half that she might " put on a good fire." 

II. — Civil History. 
The celebrated Macbeth makes his first appearance in history 
as Thane of Cromarty ; but we are acquainted with only the fact. 
In a later age, the hill directly behind the town was the scene, 
says tradition, of one of Wallace's victories over the English ; and 
a few shapeless hillocks which may still be seen among the trees 
and bushes that now cover the eminence, were raised, it is said, 
over the slain. A still more ancient field of battle is pointed out 
on a moor in the upper part of the parish. It abounds in tumuli 
and little heathy ridges which resemble the graves of a churchyard, 
and towards its eastern extremity there is a huge pile of stones, 
known to the people of the place as the grey-cairn ; but the con-

flict, of which only these vestiges remain, seems to have taken 
place in a remote and misty period, ere the ingenuity of man 
had taxed itself to record the ravages of his fiercer passions. 
There was a second cairn on the moor, which, about thirty years 
ago, was carried away for building by a farmer of the parish, and 
there were found on its removal human bones of a gigantic size ; 
among the rest, a skull sufficiently capacious, according to the de- 
scription of one of the labourers, to contain " two lippies of bear." 

Cromarty owed little to its Highland neighbourhood; the inhabi- 
tants were lowland Scots ; and it seems to have constituted one of 
the battle-fields on which needy barbarism and the imperfectly 
formed vanguard of a slowly advancing civilization contended for 
the mastery. Early in the reign of James IV. it was ravaged by a 
combination of the nearer clans, and so complete was the spolia- 
tion, that the entire property of the inhabitants, to their very 
household furniture, was carried away. Restitution was afterwards 
enforced by the Lords of Council. We find it decreed in the 
Acta Dominorum Concilii for 1492, that Hucheon Rose of Kil- 
ravock the main projector of the enterprise do restore, content, 
and pay to Mr Alexander Urquhart, Sheriff of Cromarty, and his 
tenants, the various items carried off by him and his accomplices, 
viz. 600 cows, 100 horses, 1000 sheep, 400 goats, 200 swine, and 
400 bolls of victual ; but how immense an amount of suffering 
must the foray have occasioned, from which nothing could be 
subtracted by any after sentence of the law  

Eminent Men. — Sir Thomas Urquhart, so famous for his Gene- 
alogy and his Universal Language, was a native of Cromarty, and 
during the reign of Charles I. proprietor of nearly the entire shire. 
He was born in 1613, and died on the continent after an eventful 
life, spent in courts and camps, in prison and in exile, on the eve 
of the Restoration. Few of his works survive. Nearly a hundred 
manuscripts, the labours of his studious hours, were lost on the 
disastrous field of Worcester, where he was taken prisoner by 
the army of the Commonwealth. Enough remain, however, to 
show the extraordinary mind of the writer. He was one of that 
singular and highly curious class of geniuses, in whom rare and 
uncommon talents seem to rest, not on their proper basis of prac- 
tical good sense, but on a substratum of extravagance and absurdity. 
A periodical critic of the present age describes him as " not only 
one of the most curious and whimsical, but one of the most power- 
ful also, of all the geniuses our part of the island has produced."

The late Dr James Robertson, Librarian of the University of 
Edinburgh, and Professor of the Oriental Languages, was, like 
Sir Thomas, a native of Cromarty. His history is that of many 
a scholar, and many a man of genius besides. He entered life 
poor and friendless, and with a thirst for knowledge which every 
fresh draught served only to increase, spent his early days m a 
long struggle with difficulties and privations, which a spirit not in- 
vincible could not have overcome. He is the author of a Hebrew 
grammar, to which the self-taught linguist, Dr Alexander Murray, 
owed, as he tells us in his interesting autobiography, his first intro- 
duction to Hebrew ; and we learn from Boswell, in his Journal of 
a Tour to the Hebrides, that Dr Johnson when in Edinburgh 
" was much pleased with the College Library, and with the conver- 
sation of Dr James Robertson, the librarian." 

Traditional Stories. — There is hardly a district of Scotland that 
has more traditional stories connected with it than the parish of 
Cromarty, or whose legends seem more various in their origin, or 
are more distinctly impressed with the character of the past ages. 
Some of these belong evidently to a very early period, and seem 
to have floated into it from the neighbouring Highlands. There are 
other stories which are peculiar to it as a remote sea port, inhabit- 
ed for ages by sailors and fishermen ; while a third and more recent 
class belongs to it as an insulated lowland colony. No single story, 
therefore, can be regarded as a specimen of the whole ; and it is, 
besides, rather a nice matter to make choice of one, when there are 
hundreds from which to select ; but even one, though taken at ran- 
dom, may serve as a sort of relief to the dryness of topographical 
history. 

There is a little path which, in the eastern part of the parish, 
goes winding over rock and stone along the edge of a range of 
low-browed precipices, till it reaches a fine spring of limpid wa- 
ter, that comes gushing out of the side of a bank covered with moss 
and daisies. This beautiful spring has been known to the people 
of the town for a century and more, by the name of Fiddler's-well. 
Its waters are said to be medicinal ; and there is a tradition still 
preserved of the circumstance through which its virtues were first 
discovered, and to which it owes its name. Two young men ol 
the place, who were much attached to each other, were seized at 
nearly the same time by consumption. In one, the progress of the 
disease was rapid ; he died two short months after he was attack- 
ed by it ; while the other, though wasted almost to a shadow, had 



10 



ROSS AND CROMARTV. 



yet strength enough left to follow the corpse of his companion to 
the grave. The sirname of the survivor was Fiddler,— a name 
still common among the seafaring men of the town. On the even- 
ing of the interment, he felt oppressed and unhappy,— his imagi- 
nation was haunted by a thousand feverish shapes of open graves, 
vvith bones mouldering round their edges, and of coffins with the 
lids displaced ; and after he had fallen asleep, the images, which 
were still the same, became more grisly and horrible. Towards 
morning, however, they had all vanished; and he dreamed that he 
was walking alone by the sea shore in a clear and beautiful day of 
summer. Suddenly, as he thought, some person stepped up be- 
hind, and whispered into his ear, in the voice of his deceased com- 
panion, " Go on, Willie, I shall meet you at Stormy." There is 
a rock in the neighbourhood of Fiddler's well so called, from the 
violence with which the sea beats against it when the wind blows 
strongly from the east. On hearing the voice, he turned round, 
and seeing no one, he went on, as he thought, to the place named, 
in the hope of meeting with his friend, and sat down on a bank to 
wait his coming; but he waited long, lonely and dejected; and 
then remembering that he for whom he waited was dead, he burst 
into tears. At this moment a large field-bee came humming from 
the west, and began to fly round his head. He raised his hand 
to brush it away ; it widened its circle, and then came humming 
into his ear as before. He raised his hand a second time, but the 
bee could not be scared off ; it hummed ceaselessly round and 
round him, until at length its murmurings seemed to be fashioned 
into words, articulated in the voice of his deceased companion, 
" Dig, Willie, and drink," it said, « Dig, Willie, and drink." 
He accordingly set himself to dig, and no sooner had he torn a 
sod out of the bank than a spring of clear water gushed from the 
hollow ; and the bee taking a wider circle, and humming in a voice 
of triumph that seemed to emulate the sound of a trumpet, flew 
away. He looked after it, but as he looked, the images of his 
dream began to mingle with those of the waking world; — the sce- 
nery of the hill seemed obscured by a dark cloud, in the centre of 
which there glimmered a faint light ; — the rocks, the sea, the long 
declivity faded into the cloud ; and turning round, he saw only a dark 
apartment, and the first beams of morning shining in at a window. 
He rose, and after digging the well, drunk of the water and reco- 
vered. And its virtues are still celebrated ; for though the water be 
only simple water, it must be drunk in the morning, and as it gushes

out of the bank; and with pure air, exercise, and early rising for 
its auxiliaries, it continues to work cures. 

III. — Population. 
Ancient Inhabitants and early Trade of the ParjsA.— Though, 
from the older names of places in the parish, it is evident its ori- 
ginal population, like that of the neighbouring districts, was Cel- 
tic, the inhabitants about a century ago were so exclusively low- 
land that there was no Gaelic service performed in its church. 
The character of the people, too, their dress, personal appearance, 
habits, and the sirnames common among them, identified them 
with their country folks of the south. They were the descendants, 
we may infer, of some such lowland colony as James VI. planted 
in the Isle of Lewis with the intention of civilizing the wild natives; 
and the facilities for trading afforded by the admirable harbour of 
the place would, it is probable, have directed their choice. The 
Scotch seem at a very early period to have been a seafaring 
people. We learn from Heron, that, prior to the reign of Robert 
the Bruce, they exported wool and salmon from the southern ports 
of the kingdom into Flanders and France ; and in charters of lands 
bordering on the sea the spoils of stranded vessels were either 
granted or reserved with much care, — a proof that shipwrecks were 
no unfrequent occurrences. Inverness and Cromarty, which seem 
to have been united by charter, appear to have shared at a remote 
period in the trade of the south. In the museum of the Northern 
Institution, there is an ancient custom-house seal or cocket of the 
united burghs of Invirnis et d Chrombhte, supposed to belong to the 
reign of Robert II. There were laid open, in trenching a piece of 
ground in the eastern part of the town about ninety years ago, se- 
veral ranges of vaidts, apparently intended for store places, which 
must have belonged to our earlier merchants ; and of a collection 
of little pieces of copper coin which were dug up at different times 
in our fields and gardens, I have found that two-thirds were Scotch, 
and the remaining third French. And it seems improbable that 
the north country trader of the obscure period to which these re- 
mains belong, could be of other than lowland extraction ; — his con- 
temporary, the Highlander, was only conversant with the dirk. 
Cromarty seems to have sunk almost entirely during the seven- 
teenth century ; a dark era of distress and depression to Scotland ; 
but it rose almost immediately after the Revolution ; and early in 
the reign of Queen Anne, when it drove an extensive trade in her- 
rings, there were five large vessels connected with it, as the pro- 



12

perty of its wealthier merchants. But it again experienced a re- 
verse. Like many of the trading towns of Scotland, it suffered 
from the Union ; the sudden failure of its herring fishery com- 
pleted its ruin; and so low had it fallen before the year 1730, 
that a single shopkeeper, who was not such literally, for in the sum- 
mer season he travelled the country as a pedlar, more than sup- 
plied the inhabitants. It began, however, about thirty years af- 
ter to emerge yet a third time, under the impulse of that general 
spirit of improvement, which, since the suppression of the last re- 
bellion, has operated throughout the kingdom; and the popu- 
lation, which has become much less exclusively lowland than 
formerly, has been steadily on the increase ever since. The break- 
ing up of the feudal system first introduced habits of comparative 
industry into the Highlands ; the breaking up of the small farm 
system has scattered many of the people over the low country, to 
avail themselves of these habits, as labourers, fishermen, or mecha- 
nics ; and so large a proportion of this class has fallen to the parish 
of Cromarty, that it was found necessary, about fifty years ago, to 
build and endow a Gaelic chapel, which is now attended by a con- 
gregation of at least 500 persons. The population of the parish in 
1801 amounted to about '2413. It had increased to 2900 in 1831. 
Fully three-fourths of the latter number are inhabitants of the 
town. 

During the last three years, there were about 6 illegitimate 
births in the parish.

Agriculture.—

It is supposed that a considerable number of acres in the upper 
part of the parish might be profitably added to the cultivated land. 

The arable part of the parish towards the east is laid out into 
fields inclosed by fences of stone or hawthorn; and "the offices 
of the various farms in this direction consist of those square- 
looking stone and lime erections, which always indicate the intro- 
duction of the modern system of agriculture. But in passing 
towards the west, we seem as if retrograding from the present to 
the middle of the past century ; we find the surface broken into 
irregular map-like patches, divided from each other by little strips 
and corners of land not yet reclaimed from the waste ; and the

steadings are composed of straggling groups of cottages built of 
undressed moor-stones, and covered with turf. In most instances, 
rows of gnarled and time-wasted elms form an accompaniment to 
these groups, as if to connect them more thoroughly with the past, 
by reminding us that the present occupants are growing old under 
the roofs which sheltered their grandfathers. The improved sys- 
tem of agriculture was first acted upon in Cromarty, on a scale suf- 
ficiently extensive to render it advantageous, by a Mr George 
Middleton, a gentleman from England, who settled in the parish 
about forty years ago. It had been introduced into the place by a 
spirited proprietor of whom more anon nearly twenty years 
before. 

Mr Middleton erected the first thrashing mill seen in this part of 
the country, and exported the first wheat ; for it is a singular fact, 
that, forty years ago, there was not a field of this grain reared in 
the parish, though it now forms the staple of its agriculture, and 
one of the chief exports of its trade. The difiiculties which of 
late years have borne so heavily on our farmers, have done much 
towards the general introduction of the modern system. In the 
universal struggle with high rents on the one hand, and very low 
prices on the other, all have striven to restore the balance destroy- 
ed through the reduction in the value of their produce, by adding 
to its amount; and the observation and experience of a full quar- 
ter of a century have convinced even the most prejudiced, that 
there is but one set of means through which the necessary amount 
can be obtained. During the last ten years every farmer in the pa- 
rish has reared and exported wheat ; but the inevitable effects of 
over-production have already become apparent ; the value of this 
grain is fast sinking below even that of oats and barley, and a con- 
sequent change of system must necessarily ensue. 

The lands of the parish, with the exception of a few little patch- 
es, are divided between two proprietors, Hugh Rose Ross, Esq. 
of Cromarty, and Captain George Mackay Sutherland of Udale. 
The extensive and beautiful estate of the former contains nearly 
6500 acres, of which 1800 are arable, and the rest underwood and 
pasture. The highly cultivated property of the latter gentleman, 
one of the most beautiful in this part of the country, contains 
about 500. 

The rental of the parish is estimated at about L. 3300. 
Trade, Manufacture, Fishery. — About the year 1T65, the estate 
of Cromarty was purchased by Mr George Ro.ss, a gentleman of

superior talents and singular energy of character, who had realiz- 
ed an immense fortune in England as an army agent. He owed 
his first advancement in life to the patronage of the celebrated 
Lord Mansfield ; and the redoubtable Junius, who spared no one 
out of respect to his lordship, alludes to him in one of his letters 
in no very friendly spirit, as " George Ross, the Scotch agent." 
And justly might the satirist have accused him of a true Scotch- 
man-like attachment to his country. No one ever did so much for 
this northern part of it, or pointed out with more statesman-like sa- 
gacity its hitherto neglected resources. He furnished the town, 
at a great expense, with an excellent pier ; established in it a 
manufactory of hempen cloth, which has ever since employed about 
200 persons within its walls, and fully twice that number without; 
built a brewery, which at the time of its erection was the most ex- 
tensive in the north of Scotland ; and first set on foot a trade in 
pork for the English market, which, for the last twenty years, has 
been carried on by the traders of the place to an extent of from 
about L. 15,000 to L. 20,000 annually. None of his various pro- 
jects seem to have been entered into with an eye to personal ad- 
vantage ; and though all of them were ultimately found to be be- 
nefits conferred on the country, not one of them proved remune- 
rative to himself. The Gaelic chapel, already referred to, and the 
town-house, a neat substantial edifice, with a large hall in the up- 
per storey, and a prison in the lower, and surmounted by a dome 
furnished with a clock, were two of his gifts to the place. There 
is but one branch of trade connected with Cromarty, whose his- 
tory is not comprised in that of this patriotic and generous pro- 
prietor. The herring fishery, which in the reign of Queen Anne 
furnished its only staple, was so successfully prosecuted about 
twelve years ago, that more than 20,000 barrels were exported in 
one season ; but of late years the fish seem almost to have desert- 
ed the frith, and many of the fishermen, in consequence of a se- 
ries of expensive and ill remunerated exertions, have sunk into ab- 
ject poverty. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Towns, Villages. — Rather more than half a century ago, there 
was a small village in the parish, named Meikle-Farness ; but it 
has since disappeared under the influence of those changes, which, 
within the last fifty years, have new modelled the domestic econo- 
my of the country. The steam looms of Glasgow and Paisley 
have stripped the village weaver of his employment ; the manufac-

turers of Sheffield and Birmingham have discharged its smith ; 
the taste for fashionable furniture, to which the improved dwel- 
lings of our agriculturists naturally led, has shut up the workshop 
of its carpenter ; and the love of dress, so universally diffused in the 
present age, has levelled the domicile of its tailor, and the stall of 
its maker of Highland shoes. The town of Cromarty is pleasant- 
ly situated in the eastern part of the parish, on a low alluvial pro- 
montory, washed on two of its sides by the sea. It is irregularly 
built, exhibiting in its more ancient streets and lanes, that home- 
ly Flemish style of architecture characteristic of all our older towns 
of the north ; and displaying throughout that total disregard of 
general plan, which is said most to obtain in the cities and villages 
of a free country. The place is so surrounded by friths and arms 
of the sea, that its communications with neighbouring districts are 
frequently interrupted. Much, however,.' has been done to facili- 
tate the necessary intercourse. In the summer months, an omni- 
bus phes every day, except Sundays, between the town and Inver- 
ness, passing in its route through the towns of Chanonry, Rose- 
markie, and Avoch ; a steam-boat from Leith touches at it once 
a-week ; and a splendid vessel of this description, intended to trade 
between London and the upper towns of the Moray Frith, Cro- 
marty among the rest, is now in course of building. The town 
has its post-office, from which letters are sent once a-day to join 
the mail at Inverness ; and there has lately been established in it a 
branch of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, which promises to 
be of much advantage to the trading interests of the district. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Prior to the Reformation there were no 
fewer than six chapels in the parish, but a low broken wall and a 
few green mounds now form their only remains, — even the very 
names of three of the number have perished. Two of the others 
were dedicated to St Duthac and St Rennet, and two fine springs 
on which even time himself has been unable to effect any change, 
come bubbling out in the vicinity of the ruins, and bear the names 
of their respective saints. Of the last and most entire, which is 
still known as the chapel of St Regulus, it is said that there once 
belonged to it a valuable historical record, — the work, probably, 
of some literary monk or hermit,— which at the Reformation was 
carried away to France by the priest. The parish church, a true 
Presbyterian edifice, is situated in the eastern part of the town. 
Its first minister was a Mr Robert Williamson, whose initials may 
still be seen on a flat triangular stone, which bears date 1593, and

whose name occurs oftener than once in Calderwood. We learn 
from the historian, that " Jesuits having libertie to passe thorough 
the countrey in 1583, during the time of the Earle of Hunthe's 
lieutenantry, great coldness of religion entered in Ross ;" and 
that by an act of council passed five years after, Mr Robert Wil- 
liamson was among the number empowered to urge matters to an 
extremity against them. Few parishes have been so fortunate in 
their clergymen as Cromarty. Since the days of Episcopacy, when 
its excellent and honest pastor, a Mr Hugh Anderson, was eject- 
ed from his charge, and a curate thrust into his place, there has 
not been a single instance of the induction of a minister in oppo- 
sition to the wishes of the people. All its clergymen, too, have 
been hard-working men of the evangelical school ; and it seems a 
natural consequence that there are at present not half-a-dozen 
dissenters in all its population, and not more than two persons op- 
posed to the principle of church establishments. The minister's 
stipend is 16 chalders. The glebe, which contains about five acres, 
has been valued at L. 15 per annum. 

Education, Poor, Friendly Societies. — The parish is amply fur- 
nished with the means of instruction. It has, hke every other, its 
proper parochial school, furnished with all the legal accommoda- 
tions. A society school, in which Gaelic is taught, has been sta- 
tioned in the upper part of it for the last quarter of a century. Two 
other schools have been opened in the town by masters who de- 
pend solely on the fees ; and a free school, taught on the system 
of Sheriff Wood, together with a female school, have been es- 
tabhshed in it for the last six years, by a Society of the place. 
There are one or two other schools besides; and a Sabbath 
school, which seems to have done more for the manners and 
morals of females in the lower ranks than any of the others, 
is taught by the ladies of the place. Our farmers and mechanics 
in the main an intelligent race, and strikingly marked by those 
traits of character which are said to be peculiar to the lowland 
Scotch seem fully alive to the benefits of education,— but these 
cannot be appreciated unless they be known ; and the poor fisher- 
men of the place, whose perilous and uncertain profession has a 
tendency to keep them ignorant, and who have been both dis- 
heartened and crippled in their means by the late failure of the 
herring fishery, are much more careless in availing themselves of 

its advantages. . 

The poor of Cromarty, partly from the superior amount of 



CROMARTY. 



17 



the regular contributions made in the parish, and partly through 
legacies bequeathed for their support, are more largely pro- 
vided for than the poor of most of the neighbouring districts; 
but it has been observed that every new addition to their funds 
has had the effect of adding less to their comforts than to their 
number. There is a continual influx of strangers who settle in 
the outer skirts in the parish, and who, after residing in it for the 
legal term, have recourse for support to its Session ; and that ex- 
cellent spirit of independence which so ennobled the Scottish poor 
of the last age, and inspired them with so wholesome a dread of 
being indebted to aught save their own exertions, seem to be fast 
evaporating under the influence of a lower toned morality than 
that which characterized our fathers. In some degree, however, 
the spirit still survives among the more intelligent of the people ; 
and we owe to it the establishment of several friendly societies, 
which have the merit of ministering to the wants of the individuals 
which compose them, when overtaken -by age or sickness, without 
trenching on their self-respect. One of these in particular, " The 
Cromarty Friendly Society," which has been established since 
1801, has distributed for the last ten years from L. 90 to L. 100 
annually, among decayed and ailing members. 

The average number of persons receiving parochial aid is 150; 
and the average annual amount of contributions for their relief is 
L. 172. The amount arising from church collections for the year 
ending April last was L. 70 : the amount of voluntary assessments 
for the year 1835, was L. 27, 9s. 3d. The annual amount from 
alms or legacies, seat-rents, mortcloth, &amp;c. L. 75. 

General Remarks. 
The people of Cromarty in general eat and dress rather better 
in the present day, than at the time of the last Statistical Account. 
Their employments, too, though aff"ected by occasional depres- 
sions, are in the main less interrupted ; they work harder, are more 
ingenious, and more freed from the influence of superstition; their 
mformation embraces a wider range ; they are better acquainted 
with the principles of agriculture and of trade ; and they have 
learned to identify their interests as a body with those of the 
people everywhere. Their intelligence, too, "is of a different cast 
from that of their fathers, and derived from a very opposite source; 
It IS much less peculiar to them as Scotchmen and Presbyterians. 
Formerly, when there were comparatively few books and no peri- 
odicals in this part of the country, there was but one way in which

a man could learn to think. His mind became the subject of some 
serious impression ; he applied earnestly to his Bible and the stand- 
ards of the church; and in the contemplation of the most import- 
ant of all concerns his newly awakened faculties received their first 
exercise. And hence the peculiar tone of his politics, and the exclu- 
sive character of the liberty for which he deemed it his duty to con- 
tend. Hence, too, the nature of his influence in the humble sphere in 
which he moved ; an influence which the constitution of his church, 
from her admission of lay members to deliberate in her courts, 
and to direct her discipline, tended powerfully to increase ; it was 
not more intellectual than moral, nor moral than intellectual. He 
was respected not only as one of the best, but also as one of the 
most intelligent men of the parish, and impressed the tone of his 
own character on that of his contemporaries. But a thorough, 
though noiseless revolution has taken place, — new sources of intel- 
ligence have been opened up, — it is the newspaper and the maga- 
zine, not the Catechism and the Confession of Faith, that are now 
stereotyped on the public mind ; and the older and better source, 
under the influence of causes which it might prove a melancholy', 
but no uninstructive task to trace, seems to have lost much of its 
efficacy. But on questions so open to prejudice, there must ob- 
tain an immense variety of opinion ; almost every one would hold 
-the balance after his own fashion, and decide diff'erently regarding 
the result; nor is the subject one of those which can be discussed 
in a single paragraph, nor by a common pen.

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 



I.— Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The derivation of the name of this parish from Ncuk or 
Nook a corner seems improbable. In some old records of the 
parish, the name is spelled Wig and Wigg. It is probably, there- 
fore, of the same origin as the names of the parishes of Uig and 
Wick. Bailey, in his Etymological Dictionary says, that Wich or 
Vich is a Saxon word for bay or harbour. 

" Drawn up by the late incumbent, the Rev. Lewis Rose, now minister of Duke 
Street Church, Glasgow. 



NIGG.

Extent, 8fc. — The parish is situated in 57°, 44', north latitude; 
and 4° west longitude ; and forms the most southern point of the 
district called Easter Ross. It is nearly 6 miles in length ; from 
2 to 3 miles in breadth ; and contains about 14 square miles. It 
is bounded on the south-east by the Moray Frith ; on the south 
and west by the Cromarty Frith ; and on the north by the parishes 
of Loofie Easter and Fearn. 

Topographical ApjJearances. — About one-third of its extent con- 
sists of what is called the Hill of Nigg. This hill is about five 
miles in length and one in breadth ; it extends along the shore of 
the Moray Frith, from the north Sutor of Cromarty the southern 
extremity, to the farm of Shandwick the north-east extremi- 
ty, and varies in height from 300 to 500 feet. The rock over- 
hanging the shore is generally 300 feet in perpendicular height ; 
in many parts covered with ivy trees of wonderful size, and stud- 
ded with caves and fissures, which must be seen in order to be ad- 
mired. From the highest part of the hill, nine counties may be 
seen by the naked eye, when the state of the atmosphere is favour- 
able, viz. Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, Cromarty, Inverness, Nairn, 
Moray Banff, and Perth. The soil of this portion of the parish is 
generally poor, cold, and wet. The greater part has been plant- 
ed with Scotch firs, which thrive or fail according to the favourable 
or unfavourable circumstances in which they are placed. All the 
inhabitants are comprised in twelve families. 

The remaining two-thirds of the territorial extent of the parish 
consist of a naturally fertile slope on the north-west side of the hill, 
and an equally fertile plain betwixt the termination of the slope 
and the boundaries of the parishes of Logie Easter and Fearn. 
Much has no doubt been done, of late years, by various proprietors 
in the way of improving this extensive slope and plain ; but still 
much remains to be done. Roads, and drains, and fences and 
trenching are required. In few cases has good taste in planning 
farms and dividing fields been hitherto shewn, and in as few have 
the cottages of the poor been located and built with a regard to 
cleanliness and freedom from damp. Indeed, the writer is con- 
strained to state, that, good as is the soil of this part of the parish, 
there is not a spot of it on which the eye can look with unmingled 
pleasure. The parish is inferior to none in Scotland in soil and 
other natural advantages. Why should it be at once proverbial 
for its fertility, and a bye-word for its ruggedness  

" It was called of old the Bishoii's Forest.

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



The Sands of Nigg a name given to a large bay of the Cro- 
marty Frith belong partly to the parish of Nigg and partly to the 
parish of Logie Easter, a small rivulet named the Pot being the 
boundary. They are about one mile in breadth at the east end, 
and two at the west. During high water, and more especially at 
spring tides, they are covered by the sea to the depth of from 4 
to 8 feet ; but at low water they are dry, and eminently useful. 
Here are to be found in abundance, in their . respective seasons, 
cockles and mussels, and flounders and sand-eels ; and it is here, 
likewise, where the fishers of Nigg, Fearn, Cromarty, and many of 
those of Banffshire find the bait wherewith they catch cod and had- 
dock and whiting. On the Nigg side of the sands, vessels of light 
tonnage discharge cargoes of coals, lime, and slates, and take in tim- 
ber, potatoes, &amp;c. There is no harbour excepting the level sand ; 
and it is only by following the channel of the Pot, that vessels can 
get, even at high water, a sufficient depth for their purposes. Pre- 
viously to the importation of lime from the south, the only lime 
used for building in this country was made of shells dug out of the 
sands of Nigg. The pits caused by this operation gradually be- 
came dangerous quicksands, and various individuals have lost their 
lives in them. But now quicksands are unknown ; and there is no 
danger to the traveller who keeps to the eastward of a line drawn 
betwixt Tarbat House and the church of Nigg. To the westward 
of this line, however, there are several deep pits in the Pot, in 
which several strangers have been drowned within the last few 
years. There is one, in particular, named Poll nan Ron the Seal's 
Pool, fatal to every one that touches its waters. 

Climate. — In the more inhabited and fruitful parts of the parish, 
the climate is comparatively mild and warm, though damp. The 
insularity of the situation, and innumerable spring wells, and the 
shelter afforded by the hill from the east wind, have a considerable 
effect on the temperature of the atmosphere. It is no uncommon 
thing to find, in winter and spring, the roads quite soft in the parish 
of Nigg in the morning, while the roads are frozen and slippery 
in the neighbouring parishes, not many miles distant. 

Diseases, — Nervous disorders, and cough and asthma, are the 
prevailing complaints, and seem occasioned, in a great measuie, by 
the damp of the houses, and the poor quality of the food. It is 
observable, that cough and asthma prevail most on the north-west 
face of the hill, where there is no morning sun, and where the damp 
oozing out of the ground is great. There are no instances, now 



NIGG. 



21 



a-ihiys, of extraordinary longevity, — though a greater than ordinary 
proportion of the inhabitants arrive at a good old age, varying 
iVom seventy to eighty-five years. Epidemic diseases are not 
common. 

Hydrography. — The Moray Frith bounds the parish on the 
south-east side. The Cromarty Frith bounds the parish on the 
south and west sides. The Bay of Cromarty has the appearance 
of an inland lake, and is a remarkably safe and commodious place 
of anchorage for vessels of all sizes. It was known to the Romans 
as Partus Salutis. 

The springs of the parish, which are very numerous, are all pe- 
rennial, and excellent, though various in their qualities. Strong 
chalybeates are not uncommon. Sulphureous springs are likewise 
found, and even some containing a small quantity of magnesia. Of 
the latter description, there is at Wester Rarichie a very copious 
spring named in Gaelic Sul na ba, the cow's eye. There is a tra- 
dition that it flowed in olden times through the trunk of a tree that 
grew about 400 yards to the south-east of the present site, and 
that some injury or insult having been offered to this natural pump, 
the water disappeared, and afterwards came forth as Sul na ba. 
While the water discharged itself through the tree, many diseased 
persons from distant parts of the country flocked to it for healing. 
It does undoubtedly possess some medicinal qualities, operating as 
an aperient.  

Half a mile to the eastward of Sul na ba is a spring, noted as a 
favourite of the fairies, before they were driven away from the 
parish. If, as is said to have happened in days of yore, any of the 
little people stole a child from a parent of the race of Adam, and 
left a puny bantling in its place, the child of the human parent 
might be got back by leaving the elfin near the well, late in the 
evening, and perhaps offering some presents to the King of Fairy- 
land. 

Half a mile to the eastward of this latter well, may be found, 
at the foot of the rock on the shore of the Moray Frith, a well dig- 
nified with the name of Tobar na Slainte, the well of health or 
salvation. The occasion of its having received this appellation is 

• It would appear from the following extract from the records of the kirk-session, 
that even in comparatively modern times, this well was much resorted to, and Sabbatli 
Irofanation the consequence. " July 7th 1707. In regard many out of the parish 
of Fearn and several other parishes within the sheriffdom, profane the Sabbath by 
cum'm to the we'l of Ilarichies, John and William Gallie, &amp;c. are ajjpointed to take 
nispcction every Saturday evening and Sunday morning of such as come to the well, 
and to report the same accordingly."

unknown. It seems now a days as much neglected as that well of 
spiritual salvation, of which the Evangelical Prophet sweetly sung 
of old in the land of Judah. In the centre of the parish, near the 
Black Hill, is a well named John the Baptist's well. But why it 
has been so called, none can tell. At Dunskeathness, close to the 
ferry of Cromarty, there is a draw-well in the sand, the water of 
which deposits a siliceous sediment. 

Geology. — Professor Sedgwick of Cambridge, and Mr Murchi- 
son of London, examined the geological structure of this parish and 
coast a few years ago, and gave to the public the result of their in- 
quiries in the Transactions of the Geological Society of London. 
Last year, Messrs Anderson of Inverness favoured the public with 
a very good essay on the same subject in the " Guide to the High- 
lands :" and Mr Hugh Miller of Cromarty has, in his " Scenes and 
Legends of the North of Scotland," given an interesting and beau- 
tifully descriptive, at the same time highly poetical chapter on the 
various processes, whereby the present structures of rocks, and hills, 
and vales, have been made to spring out of the original mass of 
chaotic elements. 

But all these learned authorities may speak for themselves; and 
in the meantime the following sketch by a novice may suffice. A 
scientific one is not attempted. 

\st, The more elevated part of the parish must at one time have 
been an island, — as throughout the whole extent of the neck of land 
betwixt the Cromarty bay to the west, and the village of Shandwick 
on the shore of the Moray Frith to the east, the substratum contains 
a layer of sea shells and shingle, mingled with such organic remains 
of land vegetable matter as the neighbouring shores may be sup- 
posed to have added. Even at Fearn, which is two miles distant 
from the present shores of either frith, the skeleton of a cetaceous 
animal has been found. 

'2d, This island must, at a previous period, have formed a con- 
tinuation of the Black isle, as an examination of the submarine strata 
betwixt the Sutors will testify. The disruption may have been 
caused by an agency comparatively local. 

Qd, The rocks of the parish may be described as follows : In an 
ascending order, L The north Sutor consists of granitic gneiss, 
much foliated and nearly vertical ; conglomerate of rolled pieces 
of various size and composition ; white sandstone alternating with 
schistose limestone ; and red sandstone forming a terrace on the 
north-west side of the hill, from one extremity to the other. The 



NIGG. 



23 



two strata of sandstone are highly inclined, and stretch in the same 
direction as the hill. 2. Passing along the top of the hill towards 
the north-east, the gneiss is succeeded by conglomerate, and this 
again by sandstone highly incUned, and subsiding at Shandwick,— 
where the different strata may be classed as follows, in an ascend- 
ino- order, viz. 1. Hard red sandstone. 2. Soft white sandstone, 
containing coal apparently of woody origin, several veins about a 
foot broad, appearing just at the surface, and not easily distinguish- 
ed on account of the shingle. 3. Greenish clay passing into sand- 
stone, and containing fragments of shells and impressions of bivalves. 
4. Hard greenstone containing many belemnites. 5. A series of 
shales and limestones. 

The strata are inclined at an angle of about 30°, in the form of 
a curve, with the chord towards the hill, and dipping towards the 
south-east, under the sea. The shells are chiefly ammonites, be- 
lemnites, and GryphcBa gigantea and Gryphaa incur va. 

Nigg is very barren of minerals. Iron enters into the composi- 
tion of the gneiss in some places, and ironstone is found associated 
with the lias beds. Lime appears in the form of a crystallized 
carbonate in small veins at Shandwick, and of stalactites on the 
roofs and sides of the caves ; and when associated with some of the 
springs, petrifies the mosses, over which their waters flow. Garnet 
is, frequently after a storm at sea, spread in small fragments over a 
considerable extent of the shores, and so thickly, as to give the sand 
a deep purple colour. 

Soi7s.— The soils are various, and apparently transported. The 
west end of the parish, which has a very bleak appearance, consists 
of light sand. But a foot or two under the sand, there is a deep 
layer of fine loam intermixed with blue clay ; and there is a tradi- 
tion, on which some dependence may be placed, that the covering 
of sand is not of older date than the seventeenth century ; and that 
previously to that period, the west end of the parish of Nigg, which 
is now a sandy desert, was a fertile field. The sand is said to have 
performed its destructive work in the course of one night, as hap- 
pened in the cases of Culbin in Morayshire, and Morichmore near 
Tain. The wickedness of the laird of Dunskeath is said to have 
been the occasion of this calamity. In various parts of the parish, 
the soil is clayey. But the greater part of the arable land consists 
of remarkably fine black loam on red sandstone, the loam varying 
from one to four feet in depth. 

Zoology. ~'V\iQ neighbouring friths abound with fish of va- 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

nous kinds, such as salmon, turbot, cod, haddock, mackerel, 
whiting, cuddies, crowners, soles, flounders, skate, dog-fish, and 
herrings in their season. The rocky shore abounds likewise with 
crabs. There were many lobsters fifty years ago ; but the greater 
part of them were then conveyed to London, and now the race is al- 
most unknown, as it is only once in a season, perhaps, that a gour- 
mand can have the pleasure of seeing one at his table. There 
are a few oysters of large size in the Cromarty Frith. But they 
are seldom dredged for, and do not promise to multiply. It is 
difficult to account for the rarity of oysters now, when it is consi- 
dered, that under the soil in some of the lower grounds of the 
parish, there are to be found multitudes of oyster shells. 

Botany.— Among the rarer British plants growing within the 
range of the parish, may be mentioned Draba incana. Geranium 
sanguineum, Juncus balticus, and Oxytropis uralensis. The lofty 
and perpendicular rocks may, however, possess others, which men 
of ordinary nerves have not the courage to approach. 

11. — Civil History. 
The first era to which reference can be made, in the history of 
this parish, is the tenth and eleventh centuries,— in which the Da- 
nish invasions took place. 

There is a farm on the top of the rock named to this day Ca an 
righ, the King's Path, or the King's Cave ; and immediately below 
this farm at the foot of the rock, is to be seen a cave, named the 
King's Cave ; and from it, there is a path cut in the face of the 
rock up to the top, named " the King's Path." Half a mile to 
the north-east of the cave and path, there is a little natural har- 
bour, named Port an righ, the King's Harbour. Within half a mile 
of this harbour, there is in the sea a sunken rock about a mile in 
length, named the King's Sons. At Easter Rarichie, near the 
east end of the parish, there is a detached hillock, said to have 
been a Danish fort, and it still bears evidence of its having been 
applied to some warlike purpose ; for round the top edge of it 
there appears something like the remains of a wall or rampart. 
There is a tradition, which may possibly be connected with the 
names and localities here noticed, that a daughter of the royal 
Scandinavian having married the Thane of Ross, was so ill used 

• This rock is said to have got its name from the circumstance of three sons of 
the King of tlie Sea having been wrecked on it, and drowned. Tlieir bodies were 
afterwards found and buried, one at Hilton, one at Shandwick, and one at Nigg ; 
and tlicre is, at each of these places, a monumental stone, covered on both sides with 
hieroglypliical sculpture, and said to have been erected to the memory of the royal 
princes. These stones shall be afterwards described.

by lier husband, that she ran to complain to her father, and 
that he and his three valiant sons, whose fate has already been 
mentioned and all his mighty men of war, came to avenge the cause 
of the injured countess. 

Dwiskeath. — The next era in the history of this parish, of which 
there is any account, is the year 1 179, — when accordingto SirDavid 
Dalrymple of Hailes, in his Annals of Scotland, William, surnam- 
ed the Lion, King of Scotland, caused a castle to be built on the 
top of the rock fronting Cromarty. The site of this castle may 
be still distinguished, but nothing more. The object of its erec- 
tion is said to have been the suppression of robbers ; and from 
this, it is supposed to have got its name Dunscath in Gaelic, 
Dunskeath in English. The surrounding farm is still called 
Castlecraig. The Abbey of Fearn was built much about the same 
time with the Castle of Dunskeath ; and thus civil and ecclesiasti- 
cal power were united to subdue and civilize the wild inhabitants 
of the country. 

Bishops of Boss. — From the twelfth till the sixteenth century, 
there is no land-mark in the history of the parish. But in the lat- 
ter century, mention is made of the Bishops of Ross ; and it would 
appear, that their Lordships, before and after the Reformation, had 
a summer residence immediately behind the site of the present 
church, and that the whole of the parish, with the exception of the 
estate of Dunskeath, formed a bit of glebe for their convenience, 
Tempora mutantur. Even till the final extinction of prelacy in Scot- 
land, the parish of Nigg was a mensal charge of, the Bishops of 
Ross, and still all the lands of the parish with the exception already 
mentioned pay bishop rents to the Crown. These amount to 
about L. 200 or L. 300 a-year, according to the fiar prices of vic- 
tual. But some people maintain, that the King does not always 
get the justice he gives ; while others with equal authority affirm, 
that the bishop rents ought not to go into the coffers of the Crown 
at all, but should be devoted to the promotion of those sacred ob- 
jects, for which bishops or ministers were first appointed by the 
sole king and head of the church. 

Parochial History. — About the middle of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, a Sir John Sinclair, in Caithness, became proprietor of the 
lands of Culiss and Wester Rarichie. This led to the introduc- 
tion into the parish, of various individuals of the name of Gunn, 
from the boundary that separates Caithness from Sutherland. The 
people of the parish called them " Na Gallich," the Caithness

men ; and from this casual appellation, arose the name Gallic, 
which has been for nearly 200 years a common and rather respect- 
able name among the inhabitants. The name is now, however, 
much on the decrease. 

A Hugh Rose of Kilravock, in Nairnshire, married a daughter 
of the fore-mentioned Su- John Sinclair, and got her father's lands, 
m the parish of Nigg, as her dowery. Hugh after Hugh possessed 
them, till about the middle of the eighteenth century ; and as the 
Gunns had formerly come from Caithness, so did the Roses 
come from Kilravock, though few of their descendants remain to 
tell the tale. The lands of Culiss and Rarichie were sold to a 
gentleman of the name of Ross, who had made a fortune in Poland, 
and was on that account called Polander Ross. One of the Hugh 
Roses of Kilravock was sheriff-depute of tli3 counties of Ross and 
Cromarty in the beginning of the last century, and it was he that 
instituted the only fair in the parish. Till a few years ago, it 
was held at Wester Rarichie ; but it is now held at Ankerville, 
commonly on the third Tuesday of November. It is named Hugh's 
Fair, in honour of its founder. 

From the end of the seventeenth century till a few years back, 
the estate of Meikle Pitculzean was the property of Mr John 
Frazer, minister of Alness, and his descendants. His son, Mr 
James Frazer, the author of the celebrated and excellent Treatise 
on Sanctification, as revealed by Paul in the Epistle to the Ro- 
mans, possessed it after his father's death, and having no child- 
ren, was succeeded in it by his sister, Mrs M' Arthur. These 
three worthies deserved a better memorial than the present writer 
can give of their excellence. Their connection with Meikle Pit- 
culzean brought clansmen to it, and there are consequently thir- 
teen families of the name of Frazer in the present day within the 
bounds of the parish. 

There are two small fishing villages in the west end of the pa- 
rish, Balnabruach, and Balnapaling, each containing nearly twenty 

 Previously to Kilravock's marriage with Sir John Sinclair's daughter, there was 
an immigration of Roses to this parish, caused by the following circumstance, which 
tradition still preserves. A laird of Kilravock, it is -s.vij, or some gentleman nearly 
connected with him, and of the same. name, had marri. d iwice, and three sons of the 
first marriage had conceived a strong dislike to their stoimother — so strong, indeed, 
that they barbarously put an end to her existence. The young ruffians immediately 
inade the best of their way across tlie ferries, in order to escape the vengeance they 
deserved, and though pursuit was instant and zealous, perhaps, it was unavailing. A 
young maiden, in the first house they entered in Hoss-sliirc, became enamoured of 
one of the young men ; and by tiiis circumstance, they succeeded in finding friends 
and protection. Some of their descendants arc to be found to this day in the parish 
of Nigg.

families of fishermen; and it is remarkable, that among them 
there are only three surnames, Ross, Skinner, and M'Leod. The 
original seat of these colonies was at the foot of the hill, imme- 
diately below Dunskeath castle. But there is no plausible tradi- 
tion as to the time or occasion of their having come to the parish 
At Shandwick, in the east end of the parish, there is a colony of 
fishermen originally from the same stock. Vass, Skinner, and Ross 
are their most common names. 

The principal occupiers of the soil at present are, generally 
speaking, recent immigrants, and the most of their numerous farm- 
servants are entire strangers. There are few, if any, individuals 
in the parish whose progenitors were in it, two hundred years ago. 

Three important events have occurred at various periods since 
1694, that have had marked effects on the identity and character 
of the population. The first of these was the seven years famine 
betwixt 1694 and 1701. During that awful period, many died of 
want, the rich became poor, the lands changed their occupants, 
and the whole face of society was changed. It is to be remark- 
ed, however, that notwithstanding the sufferings endured for so 
long a time, the morals of the people do not seem to have im- 
proved in consequence. On the contrary, it would appear that, 
during a few years after the famine, vices of the most abominable 
kinds prevailed to an almost incredible degree, — as the records of 
the kirk-session testify. 

The second event is the cruel and unchristian settlement of a 
minister, in the year 1756. The people who had been highly reform- 
ed, and elevated in mind and character under the ministry of his 
predecessor, Mr John Balfour, almost unanimously resisted the set- 
tlement for three years, and spent L. 500 in law expenses. They 
subsequently became true Seceders under the ministry of Mr Bu- 
chanan from Perthshire, and continued so for a considerable time ; 
and though now the parish church be full, and the parish minister 
has no reason to complain of want of people, no Christian philan- 
thropist can help bewailing the circumstance that turned away from 
the church many of the Lord's people ; neither can he cease to de- 
plore the extremities to which many of their descendants have gone, 
and the blighting influence which division has produced upon the 
charities of life. 

The third event is the introduction of the large farm system, about 
forty J ears ago. The improvement of the soil was much required 
at that time, as it still is. But its improvement may be carried 
on, at an expense of morals and human comfort which no pecu-

niary advantage can counterbalance. Many families were driven 
Ironi their homes, a few strangers were introduced in their room, 
and poverty succeeded in the train of almost all the actors and 
sufferers in the scene. The writer is passionately fond of improv- 
ing and beautifying the face of the earth. But he conceives that 
the earth, though beautiful as the garden of Eden, would be but 
a toaste without moral beauty, and that those proprietors, who ex- 
pel the inhabitants from their properties are depriving themselves 
of some of the highest enjoyments in life— the luxury of doing 
good, and the pleasure of being surrounded by amoral, a gratefuf, 
and a happy population. 

Land-owners.— The land-owners are, Charles Cockburn Ross 
of Shandwick; Sir Charles Ross, Bart, of Balnagown ; Robert 
Mitchell of Bayfield ; Hugh Ross of Cromarty ; William Murray 
of Westfield ; Mrs Taylor of Nigg and James Tayloi-, Esq. her 
husband ; and George Ross of Pitcalnie. 

Antiquities.— The only antiquities in the parish are the two 
monumental stones already mentioned, the one at Shandwick, the 
other at Nigg. The stone at Hilton is in the parish of Fearn. 

'The one at Shandwick is called " Clach a Charridh," the stone 
of the burying-ground. " Carridh" is the Gaelic word for a 
burial-place ; and it was a mistake, in the former Statistical Ac- 
count, to call this stone " Clach a Charraig," the stone of the 
rock. It is about 8 feet high, 4 broad, and 1 thick. It has been 
often described and admired by the lovers of antique curiosities. 
Mr Hugh Miller says, " that it bears on the side which corre- 
sponds to the obliterated surfece of the other, the figure of a large 
cross, wrought into an involved and intricate species of fret work, 
which seems formed by the twisting of myriads of snakes. In the 
spaces of the sides of the shaft, there are huge, clumsy-looking 
animals, the one resembling an elephant, the other a lion ; over 
each of these a St Andrew seems leaning forward from his cross, 
and on the reverse of the obelisk, the sculpture represents proces- 
sions, hunting scenes, and combats." The ground around was, 
for ages, employed as a burying-place. But it has not been used 
for that purpose, within the last fifty years. 

The stone in the churchyard of Nigg is very similar to that at 
Shandwick, though not so large. It now stands fixed to the east- 
ern gable of the church ; but it stood near the gate till about the 
year 1725, when it was thrown down by a remarkable blast of 
wind, which, at the same time, threw down the belfry of the church, 
and broke the bell. The top, like the pediment of a portico, is 



NIGG. 



29 



of a triangular shape. On the one side of this upper compart- 
ment, are two priest-Uke figures, attired in long garments, and fur- 
nished each with a book. They incline forward, as if intent on read- 
ing and devotion. Betwixt them, is a small circular table, which may 
represent an altar; and above it there is the representation of a dove 
in the act of descending to carry away the sacrifice offered. It has 
a circular cake in its bill. Under the table, two dogs of large size and 
ill-boding appearance, seem restrained by the priestly incantations 
of the human figures, from executing their helhsh purposes. Under 
the triangular top, and on the same side with the hieroglyphics al- 
ready mentioned, the surface contains the figure of a cross beset with 
serpents. The spaces above and below the arms of the cross are 
divided into rectangular compartments of mathematical exactness. 
These, according to Mr Hugh Miller's account, " are embossed 
into rows of circular knobs, covered over as if by basket-work, with 
the intricate foldings of myriads of snakes ; and which may be ei- 
ther deemed to allude to the serpent and apple of the fall — thus 
placed in no inapt neighbourhood to the cross ; or to symbohze 
for even the knobs may be supposed to consist wholly of serpents 
that of which the serpent has ever been held emblematic, and 
which we cannot regard as less appositely introduced — a complex 
wisdom or an incomprehensible eternity. The hieroglyphics of 
the opposite side are in lower relief, and though the various 
fret work of the border is executed in a style of much elegance, 
the whole seems to owe less to the care of the sculptor. The 
centre is occupied by what, from its size, we may deem the 
chief figure of the group ; it is that of a man attired in long gar- 
ments, caressing a fawn ; and directly fronting him, there are the 
figures of a lamb and a harp. The whole is perhaps emblemati- 
cal of peace, and may be supposed to tell the same story with the 
upper hieroglyphic of the reverse. In the space beneath, there is 
the figure of a man furnished with cymbals, which he seems clash- 
ing with much glee, and that of a horse and its rider, surrounded 
by animals of the chase, while in the upper part of the stone, 
there are dogs, deer, and armed huntsmen, and surmounting the 
whole, an eagle or raven." So far Mr Miller's description. The 
present writer has nothing to add, — except, that he considers 
the cross side of the stone as intended to emblematize the 
fall and salvation of man ; and the reverse side to represent the 
Scandinavian heaven. It is well known that the belief of all ages 
and countries, has been, with respect to the future world of happi-

ness, that its inhabitants are employed with full delight in those 
exercises and pursuits, which constituted their enjoyment in the 
present. The barbarous Scandinavians were no exception to this 
general rule. Even the most enlightened Christians have the 
same belief with respect to themselves. If they delight in serving 
and praising God on earth, they hope to be for ever happy in the 
same employments above. 

The only relics of antiquity, known to have been dug up in 
the parish, may be described in Mr Hugh Miller's words : 
" Not more than sixty years ago, a bank of blown sand, directly 
under the northern Sutor, which had been heaped over the soil 
ages before, was laid open by the winds of a stormy winter, when 
it was discovered that the nucleus on which it had formed, 
was composed of the bones of various animals of the chase, and 
the horns of deer. It is not much more than twelve years since, 
there were dug up in the same sandy tract two earthern urns, — 
the one filled with ashes and fragments of half-burned bones, the 
other with bits of a black bituminous-looking stone, somewhat re- 
sembling jet, which had been fashioned into beads, and little flat 
parallelograms, perforated edgewise, with four holes apiece. No- 
thing could be ruder than the workmanship. The urns were clum- 
sily modelled by the hand, unassisted by a lathe ; the ornaments 
rough and unpolished, and still bearing the marks of the tool, re- 
sembled nothing of modern production, except perhaps the toys 
which herd-boys sometimes amuse their leisure in forming with 
the knife." One of the urns is now in the possession of James 
Taylor, Esq. of Nigg. In the brow of the north Sutor, fronting 
Cromarty, there was once, according to tradition, a wondrous gem, 
which occasionally in the night season emitted a light more bril- 
liant than the zeolite of Iceland, or the carbuncle of the Wardhill 
of Hoy. But it has long since disappeared, and not a crown in 
Europe seems to possess it. 

Modern Buildings. — The only building worthy of mention is 
the mansion-house of Bayfield. It was built about forty-five years 
ago, and no house in the country can exceed it in point of com- 
fort. But it has an awkward appearance, owing to the door front- 
ing the north, and the naked and unimproved appearance of the 
surrounding grounds. 

Parochial Registers. — The session records of the parish com- 
mence on 17th December 1705. They have not in general been 
well kept, and some of them were accidentally burnt, many years 



NIGG. 



31 



ago. They consist of three volumes. There were sessional re- 
cords of an older date : but they have been lost. 

III. — Population. 
The earliest census of the population is that procured by Dr 
Webster in the middle of the last century. It was then 1261. 

Population in 1801, 1443 
1811, 1;M9 
1821, 1436 
1831, . 1404 

There are three fishing villages, which contain 420 souls. All 
the rest of the population are more or less connected with agricul- 
ture ; and even the fishers spend a considerable part of their time 
in raising potatoes. 

The number of landed proprietors is seven in all ; of these three 
reside in the parish ; and there is no rental under L. 350. 

The people are not remarkable for any personal qualities. But 
it may be observed of the fishermen, that though their marriages 
are, and have been from time immemorial, confined to themselves, 
like those of the royal families of Europe, they are in general a 
fine-looking set of men, and give no evidence of deterioration in 
any way. Rheumatism and scrofula are, however, common among 
them. 

There are no blind, nor deaf and dumb persons in the parish. 
The only fatuous individual is a well-known one, named Angus, 
a native of Sutherland, who has been for many years a favourite re- 
sidenter in the kind mansion-house of Nigg. He is a curiosity in 
his way, preferring a halfpenny to a shilling,— delighting in sohtary 
rambling among the tombs, — incapable of comprehending one ab- 
stract idea, and yet a perfect pattern of innocence, devotion, and 
love to all that is good. 

During the last three years, there were 3 illegitimate births in 
the parish. 

Languages.— The Gaelic language is that generally spoken ; 
but the Enghsh has made rapid progress of late. There is no- 
thing peculiar in the habits of the people. On Sabbath days, 
they are all well dressed, and on other days their dress corre- 
sponds with their employments. Though their lot in the world 
be not of the most enviable description, in as far as bodily comforts 
and intellectual improvement are concerned, they exhibit a moral 

 The Gaelic of the parish is not classical, though it cannot be said to be bad. As, 
trom time immemorial, there have been occasional immigrations from various parts 
ot the north of Shetland, the language of the people has been modified, and conse- 
quenUy their Gaelic and English have little of a peculiar provincialism in them.

character superior, perhaps, to that of any other parish which can 
be named. During the last twenty years, not an individual 
connected with the parish has been suspected of a felonious 
action. The people generally read the Bible and have family 
worship ; and few of them seem altogether indifferent about the 
ordinances of religion. The parish became noted, betwixt the 
years 1740 and 1750, for an effusion of the Holy Spirit along with 
the preaching of the Word, under the ministry of Mr John Balfour. 
A chosen generation then appeared, men of God and of prayer. 
There were a Donald Roy and an Andrew Roy, a John Noble 
and a Nicholas Vass, and others, whose names may be forgotten 
on earth, but whose record is on high. Vital godliness prevailed, 
— the day and house of the Lord were revered, — the command- 
ments of God were obeyed, and the character of the people afford- 
ed a wonderful contrast to the common abominations that charac- 
terized the preceding generation. The records of the kirk-ses- 
sion for the thirty years succeeding 1705, while they afford abun- 
dant evidence of the zeal and faithfulness of ministers and elders 
in checking vice of every description, are disgusting in the extreme, 
as exhibiting a frequency and a grossness of vice among the peo- 
ple, which the succeeding generation would shudder to contem- 
plate. And yet, be it added, the favourable change was produced 
by the blessing of the Holy Spirit upon the Heaven-appointed 
means, which an authoritative ministry and eldership were inde- 
fatigable in employing. Be it added, further, with shame and 
sorrow, that many of the present descendants of the " chosen ge- 
neration" already mentioned, are busily employed in endeavouring 
to subvert those institutions which were the means of bringing 
their fathers from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan 
into the kingdom of God. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — There are about 2500 acres in tillage; 1000 
which might be profitably cultivated, but now lying waste ; 100 
acres in undivided common, and 1000 under fir wood. The full- 
grown wood is sawed and sold in the neighbourhood, or shipped to 
Caithness. The thinnings are sent to Newcastle as coal props. 
The woods, however, are but of secondary consideration. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is about 
L. 1, 15s. per acre. At Castlecraig, an ox may be grazed during 
five months of the summer and harvest, for L. 1. A milch cow, 
however, is charged double. A full-grown ewe may be grazed for 



NIGG.

the year for 5s., though it can hardly be said that sheep are taken 
in for grazing. 

Ploughmen get each per annum a house; from 7 to 
10 barrels of coals, equal to from 10 to 15 imperial measure; 6 
bolls of oatmeal, each 9 stones Dutch weight; 5 bolls of potatoes 
each boll being in bulk equal to 2 quarters of wheat; a Scotch pint 
of skimmed milk, equal to an English quart every day of the sum- 
mer and harvest ; and from L. 6 to L. 7 of money. A thrasher with 
the flail gets, per boll of wheat, Is.; of barley, lOd.; and of oats, 9d. 
A day-labourer gets Is. per diem. Masons build for L. 1, 6s. per 
rood, the materials being provided. Carpenters, smiths, tailors, shoe- 
makers, &amp;c make the best bargain they can with their employers, 
and it is not believed that their average daily income can exceed 2s. 
The most of them would be very glad to compound for Is. 6d. if they 
got constant employment. The clothes used are generally bought 
m shops. The old weavers have given up their trade. 
 Live-StocL— There are few sheep in the parish, and these con- 
sist of Southdown, Cheviot, and the small country kind. In the 
rocks of Castlecraig, there are upwards of 100 goats, feeding on 
the herbs, which no other quadruped can approach. There is lit- 
tle attention paid to the rearing of black cattle. In the end of har- 
vest,- the farmers buy young Highland stock to eat the straw in win- 
ter and spring; and when summer arrives, they commonly sell them, 
if they can procure remunerating prices. Great milkers are not 
to be found. Fresh butter sells at 9d. per lb. ; cheese at 6s. per 
stone, and warm milk at 3d. per Scotch pint. The parish was 
noted not many years since for the abundance and excellence of 
Its barley. Now, however, there is little barley raised. It was no 
uncommon thing for the barley to weigh 56 lb. the bushel, and 
when distilled, to give 3 Scots gallons 24 English quarts per boll, 
of good whisky. Chevalier barley has been introduced within the 
last twelve months, and promises to become a staple article of pro- 
duce. Angus and potato oats are quite common, and the Hope- 
toun oats are coming into fashion. Wheat, however, is the far- 
mer s mam stay, and the quality of it is in general excellent, as its 
quantity is great. But it must be observed, that, owing to the high 
rents, the low price of wheat of late years, and the little demand 
for other kinds of farm produce, the land has been too much 
scourged by wheat crops. Afour-shift rotation is common, and even 
a three-shift.. Beans are much attended to now by high and low.

A good deal of lime and sea-ware are used as manure. Multitudes 
of fishers and others are much occupied from the middle of April 
till the middle of May, in providing sea-ware and planting potatoes. 
In the beginning of June, they cab them, and two or three weeks 
afterwards they take away the weeds. Then they hoe them twice, 
and in the month of October raise them. The people pay from L. 3 
to L. 4 per acre, besides manure and labour to the tenants for po- 
tato land. A few years ago, they were induced to raise potatoes 
in great quantities, in order to feed swine for the market. But now 
the price of pigs is so low, that comparatively few are reared. Tur- 
nips of all kinds are quite common, and bone manure is partially 
used for them with much success. The horses are generally of a 
superior breed, and well fed. Draining, trenching, and em- 
banking have been carried on to a considerable extent. About 
eighteen years ago, a large embankment was formed at the side 
of the sands on the Bayfield estate, and 120 acres of land re- 
claimed. But the embankment was not properly constructed at 
first, though the expense was great ; and consequently it is now fast 
giving way. There are many drains, and some of a large size, but 
many more are required. The leases are commonly for nineteen 
years. The farms vary in size from 30 to 400 acres. One far- 
mer has three farms containing in all about 1000 acres. There are 
other five farms of 200 acres each, and two farms of 100 each. 
The most of the rest are on a smaller scale. The farm-buildings 
are in general good, particularly at Nigg, where there is an excel- 
lent square of offices, built by the late proprietor. There are four 
thrashing-mills driven by water,— one at Nigg, one at Bayfield, one 
at Culiss, and one at Pitcalnie. There are three meal-mills. But 
they seldom have water in .summer or harvest, and the multure 
payable is so high, that they are avoided as much as possible by 
those who are not thirled to them. 

The principal obstacles to agricultural improvement are the fol- 
lowing, viz. 

\st. The two largest estates are strictly entailed under rather pe- 
culiar conditions, and consequently the encouragement given to im- 
proving tenants is on too limited a scale. Getting as much rent 
with as little outlay as possible, is the principle that guides the ma- 
nagement. • , 

2/, Some of the estates have been for many years under judicial 
factors, who are restricted to the letter of instructions arbitrarily 
and perhaps injudiciously given.

4, The roads have been much neglected. Thousands of pounds 
have been taken fmm the parish of Nigg to make and repair roads 
in the parishes of Tarbat and Fearn, the three parishes being con- 
stituted into one district, and the heritors of Tarbat and Fearn taking 
care of their own interests to the neglect of the parish of Nigg 

5th, There is no encouragement given to cottars to build and im- 
prove. Their comfort has been too much neglected, and their 
superiors seem to have forgotten how useful cottars might be ren 
dered in cultivating waste ground, if properly directed and en- 
couraged.

The expense of boats nets, &amp;c. has been great; and, though per- 
haps each man may have, in favourable seasons, averaged above 
L.20 of profit. It IS questionable how far the herring fishing has 
been m reality a benefit to the parish. It is true, indeed, that 
many of the fishermen were enabled by their success, occasionally, 
a few years since, to build nice cottages, and improve their furnt 
ture and there was abundance of need ; but the ordinary fishing 
for haddocks, cod, &amp;c. was a good deal neglected,_debt was in

the ordinary fishing. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Marliet-Towns.—Cvomvi and Tain are the nearest market- 
towns. The former is separated from the parish by the Ferry, 
about a mile broad; and the latter is six miles distant from the 
part of the parish that is nearest to it. Cromarty and Parkhill are 
the post-offices. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is not more than lour 
miles from any extremity of the parish. It appears to have been 
built in 1626; but it has received several repau's, more especially 
in 1725 and 1786. It affords legal accommodation for 425 per- 
sons, and all the sittings are free, though fomially divided among 
the heritors. The manse was built about 1758, and repaired fre- 
quently since. The glebe is 4 acres, and worth L. 10 of rent. 
The stipend is 15 chalders, half meal half barley. There are up- 
wards of 1 1 chalders of vacant teinds. There is a dissenting chapel 
of the United Associate Synod connexion. The mmister's salary 
is said to be L. 120, besides innumerable perquisites, and is paid 
out of the seat-rents and collections at the door. The chapel does 
not give any thing to support the poor. 

It is impossible to state with accuracy the number of families that 
attend either the Established Church or Dissenting meetmg- 
house, as families are in many instances divided. 160 families may 
however, be mentioned as belonging to the parish church, and 120 
to the Dissenting meeting-house. 74 is the average number of 
communicants of the Established Church, of whom there are 18 
male heads of families. The collections for the poor vary from 
L. 10 to L. 12 a-year. About L. 16 may be contributed other- 
wise to religious and charitable objects. 

£«cail-There is one parish school, which is not well si- 
tuated for the population, though it is near the centre of the pa- 
rish There is likewise a female school endowed with L. o a-year 
by 'the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and there 
afe two unendowed schools. None of them is well attended The 
parochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 34; and the amount of school 
fees less than L. 5. He has the legal accommodations. The 
cchool fees in all the schools vary from Is. to 3s. 6d. per quarter. 
But they are seldom well paid, the parents being in general very 
poor, and many of them perhaps ignorant of the value of educa- 

tinii to their children. . -

-4s. to 10s. in the year. There is no fund, except L. 20 left by the 
late Mrs Gair of Nigg. The heritors have of late been induced 
to give L. 30 a-year to the poor. There seems no indisposition 
on the part of the poor to take. The kirk-session does not take 
any concern in the division of what is called the poor's money. 

Fair. — The only fair in the parish is Hugh's Fair, held in No- 
vember, for general purposes. It is dying away very fast. 

Inns. — There are 3 small inns, which are in many cases an ac- 
commodation to travellers ; but otherwise they are no blessino-. 

Fuel—Coah from Newcastle are the principal fuel for the more 
opulent and the farm-servants. But whins and broom, and such 
other fire-wood as can be found, constitute the fuel of the greater 
part of the population. Coals cost about Is. per imperial barrel, 
and their quality is seldom good. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

1st, The tenants do not now, as they did not many years since 
occupy the greater part of the summer in cutting and carrying home 
peats and turf from the mosses of the parish of Loggie. 2f7, 
There has been a great improvement on the comfort of the houses 
and in the dress and habits of the people. Sd, A great many 
strangers have taken up their abode here, while many former resi- 
denters have vanished. Ath, The farms are now on a different plan 
from that on which they formerly were, and the system of farming 
has been quite changed.

THE REV. DONALD SAGE, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History 
Name.—Ov this united parish the eastern division is Kirk- 
Michael. Its Gaelic name is " Kill a' Mhichail," or the Cell of 
St Michael; but this name is by the inhabitants usually given 
only to the church and burying-ground. The district which the 
ancient parish of Kirkmichael compreljnded is called Sgire' a' 
Mhichail," or the parish of St Michael. CuUicudden forms the 
western district of the united parish. Its Celtic name is CouU a

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Chuddinn or Chuddegin, signifying the Caddie Creek,— that spe- 
cies of fish being formerly, though not now, caught in great abund- 
ance in a small creek on the shore of Cullicudden, and a little to 
the west of the old church. It is probable, however, that St Martin's, 
or Kirk Martin, and not Cullicudden, was the name originally of 
this small but ancient parish. It is still called by the natives 
Sgire' a Mhartinii, or the parish of St Martin's ; and at the place 
of St Martin's, a small farm near its western extremity, the founda- 
tion of a church, surrounded by a burying-ground not now occu- 
pied, may still be seen. The probability is, therefore, that the 
parish church, dedicated to St Martin of Tours, was originally at 
the place of St Martin's; but the church being afterwards removed to 
the more centrical place of Cullicudden, the parish from this circum- 
stance came tobe so called. The union of the parishes of Kirkmichael 
and Cullicudden must have taken place subsequent to the esta- 
blishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland in 1688; for, about the 
middle or rather towards the beginning of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, and during the sway of Scottish Episcopacy, the three ad- 
jacent cures or parishes of Cullicudden, Kirkmichael, and Cro- 
marty were served by three Episcopal clergymen, viz. Mr Robert 
Williamson, curate of Cullicudden ; Mr Charles Pope, curate of 
Kirkmichael; and Mr Gilbert Anderson, curate of Cromarty; 
each of these curacies being in the gift of the Urquharts of Cro- 
marty as patrons. The united parish of Kirkmichael and Culli- 
cudden, though still so called in old deeds and in the records of 
presbytery, is better known by its more modern name of Resells, 
Ri-sholuis, i. e. the field or ridge of light, and the united parish 
got this name from the circumstance, that the manse first, and a 
few years afterwards the church, was built,-and the glebe desig- 
nated by excambion at the place of Resolis, as the most centrical 
for the convenience of the parishioners about the year 1767. Pre- 
vious to that period, the minister had his residence at Cullicud- 
den, while he preached every Sabbath alternately at the churches 
of Kirkmichael and Cullicudden. After the present church was 
built the two old churches were suffered to fall into decay. The 
gables of both are still standing. That of Kirkmichael contains 
the old bell, which is occasionally tolled at funerals.  

Situation, Extent, §-c.-The united parish lies partly in the 
county of Ross, and partly in the county of Cromar y, within 
the dLrict called an Oilcan Dubh or the Black sle on the 
south side of the Cromarty Frith. It extends in leng h, from eas 
to west about 8 miles, and between 3 and 4 miles in breadth. It 



KIRKMICHAEL AND CULLICUDDEN. 



39 



is bounded on the north by the Cromarty Frith ; on the east by 
the parish of Cromarty ; on the south by the parishes of Rosmar- 
kie and Avoch ; and on the west by the parish of Urquhart or 
Ferintosh. 

Topograpldcal Appearances. — Its form is that of an oblong 
square. From the shores of the Frith, the land rises gradually for 
nearly two miles, then sinks down into a valley ; on the south side 
of which, it again rises rather abruptly until it terminates in the 
summit of a hill called the Maole-Buidhe i. e. the yellow brow 
or ridge. The top of this hill, which is the precise boundary of 
the parish to the south, is called the Ard Meadhonach, or high mid- 
land, as it runs through the very centre of the Black Isle, and is 
equidistant from the Friths of Fort George and Cromarty, by 
which that district is bounded to the north, south, and east. This 
is the only elevation in the parish which most nearly approaches 
to any thing resembling a mountain range. It may be about 800 
feet above the level of the sea. The valley at the base of it con- 
tains nearly all the arable land of the parish, and runs almost 
through the whole of it. The extent of coast from east to west, 
including all the sinuosities of the frith, may be about ten miles. 
The shore is gravelly, interspersed with low flat rocks, and below 
flood-mark. 

Meteorology, Climate. — There is nothing very peculiar in the 
climate. It is usually moist and cold about the middle of spring. 
The snow during the winter months, owing to the almost insular 
situation of the district of the Black Isle, does not lie long upon 
the ground. The coldness of the spring, the prevalence of rain 
and easterly winds, and a sour damp soil, retard the labours of 
spring, and protract both sowing and reaping nearly a month long- 
er than in those parishes in the immediate vicinity to the south. 
Dry weather, often frosty at night, commences about the middle 
or end of May, and the wind shifts to the north-west, from which, 
with but few intermissions, it continues to blow during the rest of 
the season, sometimes with great violence, and heightened by the 
valley through which it rushes, — so that trees planted in hedge- 
rows which have not a firm hold of the soil, all over the parish, 
have a cast to the east. In autumn, the high west winds occasion 
much loss to the farmer by shaking, more especially in those more 
elevated localities which have neither woods nor hedges to protect 
them. Thunder storms usually occur about the beginning of July, 
after a long course of dry scorching weather. They have been 



40 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



known in some seasons, though not with any degree of violence, 
to continue for a week, beginning at noon and ending at sunset. 
Any instances, however, oi" houses being struck by lightning or of 
loss of life thereby, whether of man or beast, the oldest persons living 
never saw or heard of. In winter when loose and open, thunder 
storms have occurred but very seldom. The polar lights are visible 
almost every night after the autumnal equinox, often before. They 
were distinctly visible this year about the 1st of August, or even 
about the middle of July. It has been ascertained by observa- 
tion, that when close to the verge of the horizon, they indicate 
loose stormy weather ; when more elevated, fair but frosty weather. 
About four years ago, the aurora assumed here an unusually 
striking and magnificent appearance. It was observed at midnight 
and about the middle of October, shooting along the whole extent 
of the upper region of the sky; and, after assuming various fantas- 
tic shapes, it formed itself into an immense arch resembling a rain- 
bow, diffusing over the heavens a pale but vivid light, and giving 
a most unearthly appearance. The climate in general, however, 
is certainly salubrious. The people are healthy, and many among 
them attain to a very advanced age. The oldest man in the parish 
is now enteiing his 109th year. Epidemic distempers are rare ; 
and the Asiatic cholera, which, in 1832, so fatally visited the sur- 
rounding parishes of Avoch, Cromarty, and Kilmuir Wester, and 
Suddie, appeared in this parish only in the case of one man, who 
recovered after a, comparatively short but severe illness, 

Hyd7-ography — Friths. — The only Frith or arm of the sea in 
this parish is, as already mentioned, the Frith of Cromarty, or per- 
haps, more properly speaking, the estuary of the river Conon, a 
large and beautiful stream, which runs into the Frith \ mile above 
Dingwall, and about 7 miles beyond the western boundary of this 
parish. The extreme length of the Frith from the town of Ding- 
wall to the Sutors of Cromarty, may be about 23 miles. Its 
depth varies, but does not exceed 20 fathoms. Its waters, parti- 
cularly at the west end of the parish, are brackish, and during the 
winter floods, and at low water, almost fresh, and of a deep brown 
colour. There are no quick-sands on this side of the Frith, with 
the exception of a single spot from which clay formerly had been 
dug, immediately below the House of Poyntzfield ; but there are 
very dangerous ones on the opposite side, particularly in the bay 
of Nigg, where many lives have been lost. 

Springs, Rivulets,  c. — The north side of the parish is totally 



KIRKMICHAEL AND CULLICUDDEN. 



41 



destitute of springs, in consequence of which, during the summer 
drought, the inhabitants are very ill supplied with water. Such 
as can afford it, are under the necessity of digging wells and erect- 
ing forcing-pumps at a considerable expense. A well of this de- 
scription was dug by the present incumbent, about four years ago, 
behind the manse, to the depth of thirty feet ; and it is remarkable 
that the water issuing through a red species of rock has the 
smell and much of the taste of the celebrated Strathpeffer mi- 
neral. Strong springs, and of excellent quahty, abound in the 
south side of the parish. The only stream of fresh water is 
what is called the Burn of Resolis, — which, issuing from a small 
lake at Kinbeachie, at the western extremity of the parish, runs 
throughout its whole length, drives two or three mills in its 
course, and, after receiving four small tributary streams, falls into 
the Frith at the village of Gordon's mills. There are no mineral 
springs of any note in the parish. 

Geology, Mineralogy. — The prevailing rock in this parish is 
sandstone or freestone. Geologists refer it, in greater part, to the 
old red sandstone formation. The soil, with but few exceptions, 
is poor and unproductive. A black light loam covers a hard till 
on a substratum of clay. The till itself is a composition of clay 
and gravel, and the inveterate foe of vegetable life. In trench- 
ing, it is necessary either not to reach the till at all, or to go 
at least a foot and a-half beyond it, in order to break it up altoge- 
ther, and place the substratum of clay on the surface. In many 
places, the till is so far below the surface, or so very thick, that this 
is impracticable ; and in any case the expense is so great, that it has 
never been attempted. The effect is, that in spring, which is usu- 
ally rainy, the soil is so wet as entirely to prevent early sowing, — 
whilst the summer drought hardens it almost to the consistency of 
rock; and the growth and grain are miserable. On the west and 
north-west side of the parish, and close by the shore, the soil forms 
an exception to this almost general character of it. It is there 
kmdlier, and of a sharper and better quality. The baneful 
till is absent; the bottom is chiefly freestone. The soil, how- 
ever, is so light after all, that sowing must commence before the 
moisture of the spring rains be exhausted by the too near approach 
of summer drought and warmth. Lime answers well, provided the 
surface be properly drained,— which, owing to the inequalities of 
the ground in the greater part of the parish, is attended with con~, 
siderable difficulty and expense. Simple minerals are either 



42 



ROSS AND CllOMARTY, 



wanting, or at least undiscovered. The lead ore found in the free- 
stone rock to the south of the mill of St Martin's, by the late Mr 
Gordon of Newhall, in 1786, has ever since been unnoticed. Some 
indications of coal were a few years ago observed near the freestone 
quarry at CuUicudden ; but a closer investigation has never been 
attempted. It is highly probable that coal exists in the parish ; 
but the expensive, though ultimately unsuccessful, efforts of the 
late Marquis of Stafford at Brora, in the neighbouring county 
of Sutherland, pretty clearly prove that both the quality of the 
coals, and the enormous expense of mining, are insuperable ob- 
stacles to any thing like a profitable coal trade so far north, and 
probably even north of the county of Fife. At CuUicudden, a 
freestone quarry has been opened, and in operation for many years. 
The materials of many public buildings and of stone piers have 
been taken from this quarry. The freestone varies both in quality 
and colour ; in colour, from red to a deep yellow. The quality of 
the red freestone is seldom good. If taken, as too often it has been, 
near the surface, it blasts, and, by the action of the weather, it very 
soon crumbles down. The yellow is rather better, but is often 
almost equally friable under the action of a northern climate. 
To secure the good materials which this quarry affords, the only 
way is to quarry at a considerable depth, — perhaps nine or twelve 
feet. 

Zoology. — No animals of the rarer kind are found in this parish. 
Moor-fowl or grouse, though very scarce, is to be found on the 
Maoile Buidhe. Partridges and hares are very numerous. Rabbits 
were introduced a few years ago, by a gentleman who had a tempo- 
rary residence in this parish, and have now so much increased as to 
have become a public nuisance. In most cases, they burrow under 
ground; but the east end of the parish being overgrown with furze or 
whins, when burrowing is not practicable, they find shelter and nes- 
tle in them. Roes are found among such of the plantations as are 
not yet cut down, — though not very numerous. The fish caught in 
the Fi'ith by stake-nets and yares, are chiefly salmon of excel- 
lent quality : they are sent to the London market. Skate and 
whitings or cuddies, are caught by nets laid during the silence of 
night. Herring-fry, salmon, and salmon-trout, as well as the cut- 
tle-fish, and other species of the rarer kind, are often caught in a 
yare, the property of Major Munro of Poyntzfield. Shell-fish is 
also found on the rocks, but more abundantly in a small bay or

creek below Poyntzfield, on the sands at low water, and at spring- 
tides. 

Trees. — There is no natural wood in this parish, with the ex- 
ception of a few patches of birch, quaking-ash, and hazel, grow- 
ing on the banks of the rivulets, running through the estates of 
Poyntzfield and Braelangwell. The surface of the parish where 
it has not been planted is generally bare and moorish, yielding 
only furze, and a stunted kind of heather. Very extensive plan- 
tations of Scotch fir have been cut down on the estates of New- 
hall and Braelangwell. The larch fir in small patches, or mixed 
with the Scotch pine, has been lately introduced by such of the 
proprietors as have considerably improved their estates. It is 
much to be regretted that the larch is not more universally culti- 
vated, not only on account of the rapidity of its growth and the 
value of its bark and timber, excellent for ship and boat building, 
but also, as it is a well established fact, that plantations of larch, 
which will grow equally well on any kind of soil, instead of im- 
poverishing, as the Scotch pine always does, actually improve 
it by the fall of the leaf at the end of autumn. Hard wood does 
not altogether thrive in this parish. The climate and soil are against 
it. At the policies of Newhall and Poyntzfield, it is true, there 
are fine old trees of ash, beech, and elm, nearly one hundred years 
old, and which a few years ago made a very narrow escape from 
the axe, but in most other parts of the parish where hard wood 
has been planted, it is stunted in its growth, and bark-bound. 
Comparatively young trees of ash are covered with seed, an almost 
infallible sign that their natural growth is checked. The leaves, 
too, fall off about the beginning of September. 

Botany. — Of plants, either rare or medicinal, there are scarce any 
in the parish worthy of notice. On the banks of the rivulets, and 
among the patches of natural wood, the Oxalis Acetosella, the Pri- 
mula veris, the Anemone nemorosa, and the wild hyacinth, so com- 
mon to the Highlands of Scotland, grow luxuriantly. The Orchis 
mascula, very rarely, and the Orchis Mario, rather abundantly, are 
found in the woods of Poyntzfield. The Saxifraga oppositifolia is 
found in the west end of the parish. The rag-weed, as in most 
parishes in the lowlands of Ross-shire, is the great nuisance of the 
pasture field, about the close of summer. 

H. — Civil History. 
There are no records, either printed or in manuscript, of the his- 
tory of this parish. Even the scanty, and often not very agreeable 



44 



ROSS AND CROMAUTV. 



information to be derived from the church session records, is 
wanting; these repositories of past irregularities having been com- 
mitted to the flames, soon after the induction of the late incum- 
bent. The only historical event worthy of notice is the plague of 
1694, so fatal in the south of Scotland, and which found its way, 
it is said, the same year to this parish. It raged with unrelenting 
fury ; whole villages were depopulated, and the living were so much 
wearied with burying the dead that they ceased at last to perform 
that office at all. 

Eminent Men. — Eminent characters, in a parish comparatively 
so remote and obscure, may scarcely be expected ; yet they are not 
entirely wanting, though their honour was not that which " is of 
this world." Mr James, Fraser of Brae, whose memoirs present 
us with a simple but vivid sketch of a mind deeply imbued 
with vital piety, and the force of truth, and which are already so 
well known to the religious world, was a native of this parish, 
and the only son of Sir James Fraser of Brae, one of the heritors, 
. and third son of Hugh, seventh Lord Lovat. The house in which 
he was born in 1639 is still standing, and is occupied at present by 
a tenant on the estate of Newhall. Several passages of Scripture 
are carved, in capital letters, on the west gable. This eminent 
man, from his earliest years almost to the close of his well-spent 
life, was the object of human malice and persecution, in no ordi- 
nary measure. 

We willingly assign a place, among the characters now re- 
ferred to, to the Rev. Hector M'Phail, who was minister of this 
parish from 1748 to 1774, — a man of primitive simplicity, fervent 
piety, and most eminently successful in his ministerial labours. 
His resolution was, never to meet any of his parishioners, or in- 
deed any individual whatever, whether high or low, young or old, 
without opening up to them, and pressing upon their consideration, 
that ministry of reconciliation with which he was intrusted, and 
which he had the happy talent of doing in a manner as striking and 
impressive as it was easy and familiar. Many persons still living 

• Two affecting incidents connected witii this terrible visitation are handed down 
by tradition. One is, that, when persons found tlienisclves attacicd by the disease, 
aware that their bodies after death woidd remain unburied if they did not themselves 
take some previous measures, so long as they had any strength remaining, they ac- 
tually dug their own graves, and laid themselves down in tliem until they expired   
Another is, that a poor maniac, the only survivor, not only of his own family, but of 
a whole village after waiting beside the body of his mother, the last victim of the 
plague in the place, took up the corpse at last on his shoulders, carried it to a neigh- 
bouring village, and left it standing upright against a wall.

in the parish, now very old men, recollect well, and better than 
more recent circumstances, the very words of those solemn and 
affectionate exhortations which were addressed to them, when 
children, by this eminent man of God. 

Antiquities. — The antiquary, though not perhaps to be much 
gratified, would not be altogether disappointed in his researches 
into the few relics of ancient times still extant in this parish. On 
the moors, traces almost everywhere may be observed of ancient 
encampments, and of monuments of hard-fought fields. A tra- 
dition is still current among the people, of a sanguinary conflict 
fought on the moor which stretches from the place of Resolis to 
CuUicudden on the north side of the public road to Dingwall; 
and of another on. the north shoulder of the Moile Buidhe at the 
southern extremity of the parish, and on the south side of the 
public road to Kessock Ferry : and certainly these moors, thickly 
covered as they are with tumuli, bear testimony to the truth of the 
tradition. 

About twenty years ago, a large barrow or cairn was opened up 
by the late Sir Alexander M'Kenzie of Avoch, at the farm of Wood- 
head in this parish, from which to get materials for building a farm- 
house; and in the centre of it, was found a rude sarcophagus made 
up of large flags, containing a quantity of human bones of immense 
size, which, on being exposed to the air for a very short time, 
crumbled down to the finest powder. 

An earthen tumulus or mound being broken into, at Jemimaville, 
by Major Munro, to procure gravel for metaUing a road, an earth- 
en urn of a very antique form was found in it, and which is at pre- 
sent in the possession of that gentleman. The present incumbent, 
about two years ago, employed a man to trench a piece of moor 
on the upper part of his glebe : the circular base of an ancient 
Pictish house occupied one particular spot, in trenching which a 
stone vessel was found imbedded in the soil about a foot and a-half 
below the surface, resembling a cup about four inches in diameter, 
and three quarters of an in'ch thick, and made of a piece of hard 
whinstone. It appears evidently to have been a spoon, a small 
protuberance on one side intimating where the handle was. This 
curious relic, now in the possession of the present incumbent, is 
perhaps as old as 'the days of Druidism. 

Ancient Buildings. — The only remains of ancient buildings are 
the ruins of Castlecraig or Tigh na Craig {the house of the rock, 
at the west end of the parish. It is built on the edge of a precipice 



46

close by the shore of the Cromarty Frith, and was originally sur- 
rounded by a wall which might be about twelve or thirteen feet 
high, but the fragments of which now only remain to the north, 
east, and west of it. Only a single wing of the building is now 
standing, and evidently the oldest part of it, — as, like many other 
castles in the north of a similar description, it received additions 
at different periods of time from the different owners who held it 
in possession. Its height from the top of the chimney to the base 
may be about fifty feet. Its internal structure is of a very ancient 
fashion ; the rooms or apartments being all arched, and access 
had to them by a turnpike stair, which a few years ago, was 
taken down. The roof is of stone, and still quite entire. On the 
eastern gable, and just at the spring of the roof, with an entrance 
into it from the attic, is a bartizan which runs across, ornamented 
at the base with a neat stone cornice, and finished at each end 
with a small turret or bastion. The history of the lords of this an- 
cient fortalice is little more than traditionary. The building is said 
to have been originally erected by the Urquharts, Barons of Cro- 
marty ; and one of that family, by his misconduct, falling under the 
censure of the church in Popish times, is said to have been depriv- 
ed of the castle and lands in its more immediate vicinity, — which be- 
came, in consequence, the property of the church. That this castle, 
however, was the principal residence of the Bishops of Ross is quite 
certain. An ancient document is now in the museum of the, Anti- 
quarian Society at Inverness, presented by Colin M'Kenzie, Esq. of 
Newhall : it is a warrant signed by the Bishop of Ross, and dated at 
Craighouse, his residence, — in virtue of which, certain persons were 
to be pursued and incarcerated for violently resisting the possession 
of the place of Tolly, near Dingwall, to those to whom the Bishop 
had granted a lease of it. It is probable, too, that it was after the 
overthrow of Episcopacy in Scotland that the castle and lands of 
Craighouse came into the possession of a family of the name of 
Williamson, the descendants of which are still in Germany under 
the title of the Counts Williamson. Tradition farther informs us, 
that after the Williamsons had sold it, or were dispossessed of it, 
the owners were the Roses of Kilravock, a very ancient family, and 
whose property, though now very limited, once extended over a 
very considerable part of the Black Isle. From what family, the 
lands and castle were purchased by the Gordons of Newhall, is not 
certain. 

Session Records, S-c. — The lay members of the session are

eight in number, all regularly ordained as elders. The parish is 
divided into districts, and an elder appointed to officiate in each 
district, — all of whom give in regular reports to the session. The 
register of births and marriages has been regularly kept from the 
year 1748. A register previous to that period evidently did exist, 
but only a few leaves of it remaining, its contents were carefully 
transcribed into the present register. A very elegant and massy 
service of plate, consisting of two handsome silver communion cups, 
and a large silver flaggon, was lately gifted to the session by the 
late Mrs M'Leod of London, a native of this parish, daughter of 
the late Mr Urquhart of Kinbeachie, a venerable and truly pious 
and excellent person. The session records have been duly kept 
only since the induction of the present incumbent in 1822. Previ- 
ously, and for the space of forty-seven years, there was neither a 
regularly constituted session, nor, of course, any records whatever, 
— the books containing the minutes of session before that period 
having been burned. 

Heritors — Improvements. — The united parish is divided among 
nine heritors, three of whom only are resident. The rest either 
do not reside in it at all, or visit it only occasionally. Colin M'Ken- 
zie, Esq. of Newhall, is patron of the parish, and proprietor of 
about the one-half of it. 

The number of acres imperial in the parish cannot be exactly 
stated. The property is occupied chiefly by small tenants having 
farms not exceeding 40 or 50 acres. There are only three 
large farms, the largest not exceeding 130 acres. Much of the lat- 
ter is waste land, capable of improvement either by trenching or 
planting, but which has been suflFered to remain in this state in con- 
sequence of the property having been long encumbered with debt, 
and in the hands of trustees for the behoof of the creditors. The 
present proprietor, though in easy circumstances, is advanced in life 
and unmarried; and the estate, beingstrictly entailed, passes after his 
death, into the possession of a distant relation,— circumstances which 
prevent him from projecting any improvements whatever. The 
mansion-house is a chaste and elegant modern building. The pre- 
sent proprietor has built a very commodious and handsome square 
of office-houses, with which he has burdened the heirs of entail. 

The next property in point of extent is that of Poyntzfield. The 
present proprietor is George Gunn Munro, Esq. This estate may 
be about one-fourth of the extent and rental of the parish. The

policies around the mansion-house were much improved by the first 
proprietor of the name of Munro, upwards of half a century ago, 
by trenching and planting. The trees have since attained to a 
great size, and are a very great ornament. Major Munro, since 
his accession to the estate, has very much added to those im- 
provements. There is only one farm of any extent occupied by a 
tenant. The remaining part of the estate is in the hands of small 
tenants and crofters. The other properties in the parish are those 
of Braelangwell, belonging to Duncan Davidson, Esq. of TuUoch, 
a small property once highly improved, but of late much ne- 
glected ; Drimcudden, another small property lately improved, and 
at present in the hands of the Trustees of the late Donald M'Ken- 
zie, Esq. of Newhall, consisting principally of church lands, and 
paying a heavy rent to the Crown ; Kinbeachie, the property of 
Thomas Urquhart, Esq. who has also much improved the lands, 
and intends soon to build a handsome mansion-house upon them ; 
East Culbo, the property of Dr M'Kenzie, occupied until very 
lately by small tenants, but all of whom are now removed, and the 
whole property thrown into a large farm, which Dr M'Kenzie has 
highly and judiciously improved by trenching and planting; Wood- 
head, a small farm occupied by a tenant and crofter, the property 
of Lady M'Kenzie of Avoch ; West Culbo, a part of the estate 
of Sir James W. M'Kenzie of Scatwell, Bart, on which no improve- 
ments have been made ; Gordon's Mills, a part originally of the es- 
tate of Newhall, the property of John M'Leod, Esq. On all these 
properties, the tenants are rack-rented, and the old rule of meliora- 
tions, so great a bar to agricultural improvement, is rigidly adhered 
to; by that rule, the incoming tenant at entry pays to the outgomg 
tenant a sum of money, being the valuation of the dwelling-house 
and farm-steading ; and it not unfrequently happens that the houses 
are valued at a very high rate when they are so ruinous as scarcely 
to be habitable. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the united parish, about seventy years ago, 
appears to have far exceeded its present amount. The reasons of 
this are very obvious. Small farms and even crofts have been, smce 
that time, thrown into large ones. The present incumbent has been 
in the practice of taking a list of the population annually, durmg

IV. — Industry. 

Manufactures-. — At Gordon's Mills, many years ago, the pro- 
prietor of the estate of Newhall established a snufF-manufactory, 
which, however, did not continue for any length of time, as the ex- 
penses far exceeded the profits. The premises have ever since 
been occupied by machinery for carding wool driven by a water 
wheel. The business is, however, on the most limited scale, and 
of late scarcely anything has been done. ' 

A lint-manufactory, established at Cromarty, upwards of half a 
century ago by an English company, had been, and still is, a great 
benefit to the poorer class of females in this and the neighbouring 
parishes, by giving employment to them as spinners. The prices 
of labour are now low and much lower than they have been ; but 
the benefit is notwithstanding very generally felt, and it would be 
a very great loss in the country, and bear very hard upon indigent 
families, should it be withdrawn altogether. 

There is a distillery in the parish, at the place of Braelangwell, 
famed for excellent whiskv. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
_ Public Roads.— There are perhaps few parishes in the united 
kmgdom, at this moment, more completely destitute of the pubUc 
convenience of good roads, than this parish. With the exception 
of a few hundred yards at the east end of it, there is not an inch 
of what may strictly be called " made road" in the whole parish. 
The roads that run through it have been formed by a continued 
succession of patching and repairing. They have never been re- 
gularly formed or metalled ; but men are employed by the dis- 
trict committee annually to keep the trenches open on each side, 
and to throw moist clay taken from the trenches on the surface. 

During the drought of summer, the roads are barely tolerable ; 
but in winter, particularly after a long continuance of frosty wea-

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



ther, they are almost impassable. And yet, notwithstanding this 
wretched state of the public roads, the commutation money for sta- 
tute labour has been, year after year, most punctually and even 
rigidly exacted. The blankets have been often taken off the beds 
of old bed-ridden people, by the merciless exactors. This state 
of things evidently arises from mere mismanagement as well as 
from a want of public spirit. 

Schools.— There are three schools in the parish, each of which 
is well situated for the convenience of the inhabitants. The pa- 
rochial school is in the centre. A very substantial and commo- 
dious school-house, with schoolmaster's apartments, has been 
lately built by the heritors. The present teacher also holds 
the office of session-clerk. The average number of scholars 
attending may be about 30. The salary was, in the year 1829, 
increased from L. 16, 17s. 8d. to L.30. The school fees scarce- 
ly, at an average, amount to L. 10 annually. There is another 
school at Drimcudden, established, in 1823, by the Inverness 
Education Society. The school-house and schoolmaster's apart- 
ments were built by subscription, and by collections made at the 
church doors, at several different times. The society at Inverness 
appointed the present teacher, and agreed to pay him a salary of 
L, 19 ; but afterwards, when their funds were reduced, in conse- 
quence of the increased demand for schools, and a number of 
subscribers having withdrawn, they reduced the schoolmaster's sa- 
lary from L. 19 to L, 10. The average number of scholars may 
be about 20. The fees are very irregularly paid,— the greater 
part of them is paid by equivalents instead of money, that is, 
by any commodity which the people who are very poor are best 
able to give. This school at present is in rather an unprosperous 
state. The other school is at the village of Jemimaville. This 
is one of the Assembly's schools, taught at present by Mr Gilbert 
M'Culloch, and is certainly one of the most efficient and best 
taught seminaries in the north. The intellectual system has been 
adopted, and with great success.  Many young men taught at 

• For the establishment of this school, the parish is greatly indebted not only to the 
Assembly's Committee, for the readiness with which they granted so great a boon, but 
also ™nd especially, to the exertions of Major Munro, the present proprietor of 
Povntrfrcld who not only applied to the Assembly's CommUtee to estabbsh one of 
their el ools here, but at his own sole expense built the school-house and schoolmas- 
er's apartment, and has repeatedly repaired them, when necessary Every apphca- 
fon whicrhrmade to the conterminous proprietors for aid m so laudable an under- 
Sing was fruitless; and. if he had not been at the sole expense of it himself, 
the school never had been established.

this school are now the teachers of subscription schools through 
the country, very much to the satisfaction of their employers. 

Ecclesiastical' State. — A new manse, office-houses, and garden 
wall were built here about five years ago by the heritors, on a 
most liberal plan. The accommodations thus afforded for the mi- 
nister may, without any exaggeration, be asserted to be among the 
very first of the kind in Scotland. The manse is both a handsome 
and a most convenient one. The office-houses are adapted to the 
size of the glebe, and contain almost every possible accommodation 
which the minister can require. Being built, too, on the slope 
of a hill, the necessary drains were properly attended to and effect- 
ed, so that instead of being damp and uncomfortable, as formerly, 
the place is perfectly dry.' The church is more than sufficiently large 
for the accommodation of the stated congregation which assemble 
in it. It is not, however, at present either sufficiently drained or 
lighted. The windows are numerous, but they are very small. 
The glebe is 32 Scotch or about 40 English acres in extent. There 
were two glebes belonging to the minister previous to 1774, — one at 
Cullicudden and the other at Kirkmichael, containing the very best 
land in the whole united parish. In the excambion, made about the 
year 1764, quantity was given for quality at Resolis. The late incum- 
bent reclaimed six acres of moor by ploughing. The present incum- 
bent has reclaimed all the rest by trenching, which may amount to 
about sixteen or seventeen acres, subdivided the glebe into fields of 
about four acres each, enclosed and planted them with hedgerow 
trees of various kinds, which by their growth have very much improv- 
ed the appearance of the place, which, from being the bleakest and 
dampest in the whole country, is now nearly one of the driest and 
certainly the most cultivated of any glebe in the two counties. The 
soil, however, is in general, and notwithstanding every effort and 
expense to improve it, but very thin and unproductive. It may 
here be observed, that the heritors derive no annual rent from the 
church seats. The seat rents are according to the old plan, viz. 
a sum of money,— about 14s. or 16s.— paid by every incoming to 
every out-going tenant, for his seat in the church,— and which sum 
for each seat was originally paid by the tenants to the heritors, in 
order to cover the expenses of seating the church when originally 
built. The minister's stipend amounts to 28 chalders, half barley and 
half oatmeal, Linlithgow measure, together with the sum of L. 8, 
6s. 8d. for communion elements. The augmentations which raised

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



the stipend to tliis amount were procured by the late incumbent in 
1819. 

There are at present no Dissenting or Seceding famihes in the 
parish. 

Poor. — Those' who, from indigent circumstances, are at present 
on the poor's roll, amount in number, this year, to 50. The funds 
for their support are derived from weekly collections, fines paid by 
delinquents, and donations from private and benevolent individuals, 
and which, at an average, may amount annually to nearly L. 30. 
The average yearly amount of church collections is L. 22, 7s. lOd. ; 
of dues of mortcloth, &amp;c. L. 2, 3s. 2d. ; of alms or legacies, 
L.3, 2s. 2d. In distributing the funds among them, the poor are 
divided into various classes, receiving more or less, according to 
their circumstances. The heritors pay no stated sum annually 
to the poor, excepting one, viz. Thomas Urquhart, Esq. of Kin- 
beachie, who, in lieu of the share allotted to him of the Maoil 
Buidh common in this parish, pays to the poor two bolls of oat- 
meal, This he does, not in consequence of any legal prescrip- 
tion, but entirely of his own good will, and in order to set an ex- 
ample to the other heritors, which, it is to be regretted, they have 
not as yet followed. The non-resident heritors give nothing what- 
ever. Those who do reside in the parish give occasional donations, 
chiefly of meal.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF BOSS. 

THE REV. NEIL KENNEDY, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name Logic is of Gaelic derivation, {Laggie sig- 
nifying a hollow ; and in this case it seems to have been applied to 
the spot on which the ruins of the first Presbyterian church in 
the parish are still to be seen. 

Boundaries— Extent— T\iQ parish is bounded by Kilmuir Easter 
on the south ; by Nigg on the east ; on the north-east by Fearn ; 
bv Tain on the north ; and by Edderton on the west. It is 7 miles 



LOGIE EASTER. 



53 



in length, and about 3 miles in breadth. It is called Logie Easter, 
to distinguish it from Logie Wester, which was situate on tle 
banks of the Conon, but is now united to the parish of Urquhart 
or Ferintosh. Logie Easter lies partly in the county of Ross, and 
partly in the county of Cromarty. The manse is within five miles 
of the town of Tain, the Presbytery seat, and every third year the 
seat of the Synod of Ross. 

Climate. — The climate is in general mild ; but during the preva- 
lence of easterly winds, the cold is most intense. But westerly 
winds prevail most. The inhabitants of the parish are in general 
healthy, and some of them live to extreme old age. 

Geology. — The prevailing rocks in this parish belong to the old 
red sandstone formation of geologists. 

The particular diseases to which the people appear most subject 
are coughs, asthma, and rheumatism. It is probable that the cli- 
mate and their mode of living may have some influence in produ- 
cing those complaints. Lately, we had a transient visit from the 
small-pox, which, in a few instances, proved mortal, even subse- 
quent to vaccination, the prejudices against which have now almost 
disappeared. Scarlet fever prevails much, generally in spring, and 
often proves very fatal. 

The soil in some places is a strong deep clay, in others a rich 
black mould, and in others a light earth on an open sandy bottom. 
Hence the produce must vary according to the difi'erent seasons. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — In this parish are a number of cairns, indicative, 
it is said, of a battle fought betwixt the Scots and Danes, where- 
in the former were victorious. — See former Stat. Account. 

The only modern building worthy of notice in the parish, is a 
very neat, well-finished, and commodious church, erected upon 
Chapel-hill, near the manse, at a considerable expense to the 
heritors, and fitted to accommodate 700 sitters. 

III. — Population. 

In 18] 1 tho population was 928 
1821 - . 813 

1831 - - 93-i 

There is a considerable decrease in the population since the time 
of the fo rmer Statistical Account. This is to be ascribed chiefly, 
as far as I can learn, to the system adopted by the northern proprietors 
in general and this parish in particular, of letting large farms, 
and thus dispossessing the small tenants, some of whom remove 



54 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



to neighbouring towns, some to America, and others to cultivate 
waste moors where they best can. Logie Easter, it is well known, 
has suffered more in its population from this cause, than most other 
parishes in the north. And though the system has greatly beautified 
the face of the country, and perhaps raised the rents of the land, 
it cannot be denied, that it is at the expense of the comfort in 
most cases, and, I am sorry to add, the morals, of the poor people 
in general. Necessity is a friend to virtue. 

The number of families in the parish, - - - - 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 129 

trade, manufactures, and handicraft, 33 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture is carried on in the.parish according to the most ap- 
proved modern system. There is more wheat raised in the parish 
than any other grain, and the quality is very superior. 

The whole parish at present is in possession of four landed pro- 
prietors, viz. Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, Bart. ; Hugh Rose 
Ross of Cromarty ; the Honourable Mrs Hay Mackenzie of Cro- 
marty patroness of the parish; and Charles C. Rossof Shandwick. 
Mr Rose Ross and Mr Charles C. Ross have residences in the pa- 
rish, at Calrossie and at Shandwick. Valued rent, L. 1514 Scots. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There are no market-towns in the parish. A cattle-market 
holds at Blackhill in the month of May annually, at which hun- 
dreds of cows change owners. Parkhill post-office is within two 
miles of the manse, but is situated in Kilmuir Easter. The mail- 
coach passes and repasses daily thi'ough the parish. But, except 
three miles of turnpike road, the upper part of the parish is ill 
supplied in that respect. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is now situate in the 
most convenient place for the accommodation of the people, — with 
the exception of Scotsburn, on which some families live at the dis- 
tance of about six miles, with very bad access, especially in winter. 
The church is in excellent repair, and hitherto the seats have 
been rent free, which is a great convenience to the parishioners, 
many of whom are extremely poor. The manse commands a most 
extensive, rich, and variegated view, — embracing very thriving plan- 
tations, which afford both shelter and ornament, and something 
more substantial to the proprietors. 

The manse was built upwards of fifty years ago, and is at 
present in a tolerable state of repair. The glebe consists of about 
22 acres of surface, including the stance of the manse and office- 



LOGIE EASTER. 



55 



houses ; but the quality of the soil is very light, and some of it of little 
value. The present incumbent has been at considerable expense 
upon it, but the returns have not remunerated. The stipend is 14 
chalders, half barley, half meal. There is no Government church, 
chapel of ease, nor dissenting church in the parish. We have a few 
Seceders that came here some time ago from the parishes of Nigg 
and Edderton ; but they give us no molestation ; and we dwell to- 
gether in unity. There is a catechist in the parish that visits each 
family, and is paid almost entirely by voluntary contributions. 

The parishioners in general, young and old, are most punctual 
in their attendance upon divine ordinances ; and some of them, I 
am thankful to say, exhibit in their temper and conduct the sancti- 
fying practical influence of those revealed truths to which they lis- 
ten with attention ; though, at the same time, we have reason to 
lament how few have received our report, to whom the arm of the 
Lord is revealed. 

The number of communicants averages from 60 to 70. The 
number of baptisms averages 25 ; of deaths, 12. 

There is a parish register of marriages and baptisms kept regu- 
larly by the session-clerk. 

We have had a parish Bible Society in operation for some time 
back, and have distributed many copies of the sacred Scriptures in 
the parish, and assisted, as we were able, other kindred societies, 
from our slender funds. We give the Scriptures to the parish- 
ioners gratis. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
depends on the abundance or scarcity of the seasons,7and the 
amount of the funds at the disposal of the kirk-session. We have 
had no poor assessment hitherto in the parish ; but the heritors are 
proposing to assess themselves according to their respective valua- 
tions, in a fixed annual sum, to be given to the poor generally. 
There are upwards of 40 upon the list of the poor, besides more 
than 30 that receive, at the yearly distribution, whatever in the way 
of donations can be afforded them. There are at present no resident 
heritors in the parish ; and the collections at the church seldom ex- 
ceed L. 15 Sterhng, in the course of the year. There is a small 
fund of L. 110, the interest of which is distributed once a year, 
with the above sum. Mr Rose Ross of Cromarty gives the ses- 
sion L. 2, 10s. annually, as the interest of L. 50 generously gifted 
to the session for the benefit of the poor on his own property, up-

ROSS AND CKOMAUTY. 



on his eldest son's attaining his majority. Except what may be 
given occasionally in private, individual charities, these are all the 
funds at the disposal of the kirk-session ; and it is evident they are 
utterly inadequate to afford the poor any iTiaterial relief. And yet 
it is seldom that any of the poor are seen begging from door to door, 
though it is evident that they endure great privations. The princi- 
pal fare of the lower order of society is potatoes, which, though a 
wholesome, is not a very nourishing food, especially for aged people. 
The article of salt is so much reduced in price that the poor can 
procure it for use with their potatoes. I am happy, in this place, 
to bear testimony to the kindly disposition of the higher classes of 
society, in this place, towards their poorer fellow creatures. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, — the parochial 
school, near the church, and an Assembly school in the district of 
Scotsburn. Both are efficiently carried on and well attended. 
The Gaelic language is generally spoken by the people ; and being 
itself one of the most ancient and expressive dialects known, I 
should feel sincere regret that it should become extinct. The young 
people all can speak English, and read the Scriptures in that lan- 
guage. 

The salary of the parochial schoolmaster is the maximum, exclu- 
sive of school fees; and the Assembly teacher receives L. 20 yearly. 
The fees of the latter amount to very little, as the parents cannot 
afford to pay them. I sincerely trust the Government of the coun- 
try will turn their attention soon to the duty of providing a more 
suitable remuneration to this most deserving class of society. We 
have also two Sabbath evening schools in the parish, one station- 
ary, and the other migratory, to suit several districts. And Mr 
Charles C. Ross of Shandwick has given a house and a salary, 
to establish a female school for instructing the young women 
of the parish in the branches that are suited to their views and 
stations in hfe. This instance of generosity deserves to be imi- 
tated. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In conclusion, I am most thankful to bear testimony to the re- 
ligious, sober, and industrious habits of the parishioners in general. 
At the same time, I cannot help regretting the unnecessary number 
of dram and alehouses in the parish, as aifording a temptation to 
the unwary to squander away the fruits of their labour and 
industry, and acquire habits of dissipation and vice. I sincerely 



KILMUIR WESTER AND SUDDY.

hope that those whose duty it is, will consider this matter serious- 
ly, and take steps for diminishing the number of these houses. As 
the parishioners at least many of them have no regular employ- 
ment, except in harvest, they have not a sufficient spur to industry, 
and must consequently feel the uncomfortable effects of straitened 
circumstances. — " But Godliness with contentment is great gain."

PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. ALLAN M'KENZIE, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Kilmuir signifies in Gaelic " a church dedicated to 
Mary ;" and Suddy, " a good place to settle in." The parish is now 
commonly called Knockbain, from the name of the spot on which 
the kirk and manse are built. It is bounded on the south by the 
Moray Frith ; on the north-west by part of the parish of Killear- 
nan. Its length from east to west is from 5 to 6 miles : and from 
south to north from 6 to 7. 

Geology. — The rocks in this parish belong to the old red sand- 
stone formation of geologists. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — It is generally understood that a battle took place 
in this parish, in the thirteenth century, between the Macdonalds 
and the inhabitants of Inverness. The field on which it happen- 
ed is called Blair -na-coi ; and it still bears the vestiges of many 
cairns placed there as a monument of the event. 

Eminent Men. — Among the distinguished characters born in 
this parish, may be mentioned the late General Mackenzie. 
John Randall Mackenzie was the son of Mackenzie of Suddy, 
a very old family in this county. He early entered into the 
marine service of his country, and afterwards went into the line, 
where' he rose to the rank of major-general.

He was a man of the highest honour, most pleasing disposition, 
and agreeable manners, — an universal favourite. For a consider- 
able period, he was Member of Parliament for the county of Suther- 
land, and died most gallantly while supporting one of the wings 
of the British army at Talavera. A monument was, with great 
justice, erected to his memory in St Paul's by the Government of 
the country.

larch, trees of various descriptions, and a large plantation of oak 
lately made by Mr Mackenzie of Kilcoy.

30 poles, arable; 465 acres, 0 roods, 21 poles, wood; 539 acres, 

1 rood, 14 poles, pasture ; total, 1624 acres, 3 roods, 25 poles. — 

5. Suddie, belonging to Sir James W. Mackenzie, Bart. — the 
exact number of acres not known. 

In such an extent of arable land, every variety of soil and sub- 
soil is to be found, but the following statement may be considered 
nearly correct: — Clay loam, three twelfths; sandy loam, four; 
moory soil, two ; alluvial deposit, one ; moss, one ; gravel, one. 

The soil is, in general, good ; but great part of the subsoil is 
rather retentive, probably five-twelfths of it. 

The plantations are chiefly fir, common fir, with a mixture of 
larch, but upon Allangrange, and at Belmaduthy House, all the. 
varieties of hard wood are to be found growing to maturity ; and 
upon Kilcoy's property, there is a considerable extent of planted 
oak, for which he received a premium from the Highland So- 
ciety. Upon great part of the pasture-ground, a stratum of iron 
crust intervenes betwixt a shallow vegetable mould and a deep 
clay soil, with a mixture of loose gravel or broken sandstone; 
and without the process of trenching, no species of trees would 
grow to maturity,— but, if trenched to the depth of from eighteen 
to fourteen inches, the whole would be well adapted for arable 
cultivation. 

The property of Allangrange was laid off, enclosed, and improv- 
ed in the most judicious manner, previously to the date of the last 
Statistical Account, in which the improvements are particularly 
detailed by the proprietor himself, whose strong mind and vigorous 
understanding, made him look beyond the age in which he lived. 
He left but few acres of his property in an unproductive state, and, 
as he anticipated, his son now reaps the full benefit of his judici- 
ous application of capital. On Suddy, the improvements were also 
early and considerable. On Easter Kessock, the late Sir William 
Fettes had not commenced on the same scale in which he car- 
ried on at Redcastle, in the parish of Killearnan. But upon 
Muirends, Munlochy, and Bellfield, or Wester Kessock,— to the 
great credit of the proprietor, — considerable improvements have 
been completed. Belmaduthy, Kilcoy's present seat, was pre- 
viously improved. On Muirends, which forms an extensive tract 
of very fine land, the farms have been made of convenient size,

with regular boundaries. All the waste ground, after laying off 
ornamental clumps, has been reclaimed at a considerable expense 
by the proprietor himself, and new leases of nineteen years have 
been granted without any rise of rent ; and the tenants, who now 
labour according to the rules of good husbandry, are farther en- 
couraged by an advance of money for the purchase of lime. At 
Munlochy, similar improvements, to be executed by the tenants, 
have been conditioned for on the renewal of leases, at rents pro- 
portionally moderate, according to the outlay required ; and, in 
particular, upon a large farm of fine alluvial' soil, a lease of thirty 
years has been granted, and a considerable allowance given to a 
gentleman of capital and enterprise, on condition of his bringing 
into cultivation about twenty acres of wet land, at present lying 
waste, and of reclaiming from the sea, by raising proper embank- 
ments, between thirty and forty acres of excellent carse land, — the 
proprietor being, besides the allowance, at the whole expense of 
enclosures and suitable buildings. At Bellfield, or Wester Kes- 
sock, the same proprietor has let another considerable farm to a 
gentleman of property, at the same rent previously paid, although 
he has been at the great expense of erecting a most complete new- 
set of offices, and a handsome dwelling-house, and has agreed to 
enclose the whole with hedges and stone dikes, and to allow the 
tenant L. 5 per acre for reclaiming waste land. This part pays 
stipend to Killearnan, although it was annexed quoad sacra to the 
parish of Kilmuir Wester. But, of all the farms in the parish, 
Drumderfit is the one which pays the greatest rent, being the most 
extensive and conspicuous. It has been for centuries in the posses- 
sion of the same family, of whom the present occupant, Robert 
Logan, Esq. banker, London, is the lineal descendant and repre- 
sentative. This gentleman has brought it to the highest state of 
improvement, at a great expense of capital ; but he will be entitled 
to receive from his landlord, at the end of his lease, a very liberal 
sum for meliorations. The various and extensive properties of 
Colin Mackenzie, Esq. of Kilcoy, will soon, in consequence of the 
judicious outlay of capital, present a very beautiful and highly cul- 
tivated appearance, and will, in a great degree, reward the pro- 
prietor himself, although the full benefit of them can be expected 
to be reaped only by his family ; and it is hoped that his example 
will be followed by the other proprietors, neither of whom has so 
much to do as he has already executed in the parish.

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants are hired at the following rate, 
viz. ploughman from L. 7 to L. 8 of wages annually, 6 bolls of meal, 
with as much potato land as he can cover with manure, 6 bar- 
rels of coal, with a free house and free lodging ; female servants 
for L. 3 a-year ; boys and girls in proportion. 

Live-stock. — The farmer's stock consists of cows and horses. 
No sheep are kept but such as gentlemen use for their own tables. 
For several years back, the heritors have been in the habit of liming 
their fields. Some of them use bone-dust for turnip ; and so con- 
vinced are the people of the benefit of lime, that even the smallest 
farmer has begun the use of it. When I wrote the former Statis- 
tical Account, there was only one tenant in this parish who paid 
a rent above L. 60 ; but now there are several who pay from L. 200 
to L. 300 a-year. The leases in general are of nineteen years 
duration, — some even of thirty, upon improving leases. 

Heritors. — The heritors in this parish, as before noticed, are 5 
in number : Mackenzie of Allangrange, who is principal heritor; 
Mackenzie of Kilcoy, who has purchased, since last Report, part 
of the estate of Belmaduthy, where he has built a princely domicile, 
with a fine square of every other suitable accommodation ; Gra- 
ham of Drynie, who lives in France ; Sir James Mackenzie, pro- 
prietor of the two Buddies, the one acquired by marriage with the 
daughter of Mackenzie of Suddy, the other by purchase from 
Matheson of Benuatsfield ; and the Trustees of the late Sir Wil- 
liam Fettes, Bart. The heritors are very active in improving their 
lands, by draining, irrigation, and embanking, especially Mackenzie 
of Allangrange. Sir William Fettes was at great expense in 
building piers at the Ferry of Kessock, one on each side, with 
suitable houses for the accommodation of the public ; the ferry is 
now supposed to draw in the way of rent L. 800 a-year, being a 
rise of L. 650, since the time when the former Statistical Account 
was drawn up. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

A steam-boat was attempted on the ferry ; but as it did not 
succeed, it was necessary to return to the use of the former boats 
slightly improved. There is no ferry in Scotland better attended to. 

Market-Towns.--T\ieYe are no market-towns in this parish ; but 
no mconvenience arises from this, as Inverness is so near. Seve- 
ral other markets are held in the neighbourhood. 

Villages. — There are two villages, — one at Munlochy, — the other 



62 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



on the coast, laid out by the late Kilcoy, opposite the north en- 
trance of the Caledonian Canal, and greatly encouraged . by the 
present Kilcoy. 

Means of Communication. — There is one post-office in the pa- 
rish. Carriages daily pass on the Parliamentary roads, through 
the parish, with great safety, — no interruptions occurring from want 
of bridges, which are all in good repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The minister's stipend amounts now to 15 
chalders, half bear, half meal, with L. 10 for communion elements, 
instead of 9 chalders and 1 boll of barley, 3 chalders and 3 bolls 
of oatmeal, with L. 3, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, which it 
was formerly, — making the present stipend of less value than the 
former. The church was repaired about twenty years ago, when 
it received an addition, which contains 250 hearers, so that the 
church now holds from 700 to 800, and is in perfectly good re- 
pair. There is no Government church in this parish, and neither 
missionaries, seceding chapels, nor Roman Catholics. There is 
one Episcopal chapel attended by 130 persons belonging to this 
parish, and as many more from the neighbouring parishes. The 
minister is supported by the seat rents. 

Education. — There are two established schools. The one is 
parochial ; and the schoolmaster's salary is L. 33, with suitable ac- 
commodation ; the other, commonly called Principal Baird's school, 
is supported by the General Assembly's Committee. The salary 
is L. 25 ; and there are school fees. In these schools, are taught 
English reading, writing, arithmetic, and the lower Latin classics. 
Besides, there are other two schools,— one taught at the Episcopal 
chapel ; the other an itinerating school, supported by the farmers 
who live at a distance from the parish school. The inhabitants 
are sensible of the advantages they derive from these schools ; but 
another is very much wanted. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the former Statistical Report was given in, the face of the 
parish has been greatly changed for the better, so much so that, 
between agriculture and plantations of various kinds of wood, there 
is scarcely an acre remaining in its natural state. 

I cannot omit mentioning a plan which Mr Mackenzie of Kilcoy 
has lately adopted for the improvement of his uncultivated moors : 
he has let them for thirty years at a small rent, beginning with Is. 
ner acre, with an increase at the end of every seven years of 6d.

per acre to the end of the lease, and at that rent to continue for 
the remainder of their lives ; — by which means, the parish is sup- 
plied with a sufficient number of labourers, and a total stop is put 
to emigration from his estate. 

For several years, a constant trade has been carried on, in this 
parish, with Newcastle and Hull, — fir props being exported to both 
these places, and the returning ships bringing lime and coal. This 
not only affords constant employment for the people, but supplies 
their families with abundance of brushwood, of which they stood 
much in need. 

There is no complaint arising from the want of labour. 

The rent of this parish at last report was L. 3545. It now 
amounts to L. 6000.

PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD OJ" ROSS. 

THE REV. JOHN KENNEDY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The origin of the name of this parish is uncertain. 
Tradition makes the burying-ground, which gives its name to the 
parish, to have been the burying-ground of Irenan, a Danish prince 
who fell in battle on the northern confines of the parish, where 
Cairn Irenan still exists. In all church records, it is now known by 
the name of Killearnan. 

Extent, c. — The length of the parish from west to east is from 
5 to 6 miles ; its breadth, in one part, is from 2 to 3 miles, from 
south to north. It is bounded on the west by the parish of Urray; 
on the north by the parish of Urquhart ; on the east by the parish 
of Kilmuir Wester and Suddy ; and on the south by the Frith of 
Beauly, along which it is pleasantly situate. It is wholly the pro- 
perty of two heritors, viz. the Trustees of the late Sir William 
Fettes, Bart, residing in Edinburgh, and Colin Mackenzie, Esq. 
of Kilcoy, residing at Balmaduthy, in the parish of Kilmuir Wester 
and Suddy. 

Topographical Appearances. — The elevation of the parish from 
the sea on the south side to the summit of the Mil-Bui on the 
north, is gradual. The shore is sandy and clayish, without any 



64 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



headlands, bays, or islands. The clay in the shore is used as mor- 
tar in building houses, and also as compost in muddings. There 
is a considerable variety in the soil of this parish. You will find, 
even on one and the same farm, light loam, gravel, red and deep 
blue clay. Broom is natural to the soil ; many fields, if left unplough- 
ed for three years, would be nearly covered over with a luxuriant 
crop of broom. There are many fields, particularly on the Red- 
castle property, covered thickly over with small stones; and though 
they are taken away this season at a considerable expense, yet the 
same process must be gone through, when the land is again brought 
under the plough. Nearly the whole soil of this parish rests upon 
a reddish freestone the old red sandstone, easily dressed, and when 
well selected, very eligible for buildings of any description. A quarry 
of this freestone has been worked for hundreds of years. Inverness 
has been supplied from it ; and the locks of the Caledonian Canal 
were built with stones taken from it. Other smaller quarries have 
been opened up, of late years, in several districts of the parish, of 
the same colour and quality, for the purpose of building farm- 
houses, farm-squares, &amp;c. 

Climate, c. — The prevalent diseases are, measles, hooping- 
cough, scarlet and typhus fever, asthma ; consumption rare ; liver 
complaint not frequent; the small-pox nearly extirpated by vac- 
cine inoculation. The prevailing winds are the east and the 
west. We have more rain from the east than the west. The north 
wind is not so much felt here as the west and south-west. The 
inhabitants are generally healthy, and many of them live to a great 
age. One man, born in the parish, died within the last fourteen 
years, at the advanced age of one hundred and six years, and he 
was able to attend regularly at church till within a year and a-half 
of his death. He retained his mental faculties pretty entire to the 
last. He learned more, during the last seven years of his life, of 
the mysteries of the kingdom of God, than he did during the 
whole of his preceding life. There are several persons now in the 
parish, both men and women, above eighty years of age. 

Hydrograpluj. — Asalready observed, the Frith of Beauly bounds 
this parish on the south, along its whole line from west to east. 
The water of this Frith is blackish in its colour, arising from the 
great quantity of moss mud carried down by the river Beauly when 

• The man who preecnted in church, in the times of my two immediate predeces- 
sors, is now ahove eighty, and still precents in the Gaelic service occasionally,— works 
at his loom as formerly,— and continues to enjoy excellent health and spirits. 



KILLEARNAN. qq 

flooded. The water is brackish in its taste, from the quantity pour- 
ed by the Beauly into the Frith. In the broadest part, the Frith of 
Beauly may be three miles. Its depth may average from one to 
six or seven yards. There are several excellent springs in the pa- 
rish. 

Geologtj and Mineralogy.— Theve are no limestones, granites, 
or porphyries, as yet discovered in this parish, the prevailing rock 
being the old red sandstone. Mines are not here known. The 
quality of the soil, as already stated, is various. 

2ooZoy.— Serpents are found, but are not numerous. There are 
also foxes and polecats; but, as there are not many sheep reared 
m the parish, their haunts are not narrowly looked after. There 
are no rare species of animals known in this parish, nor am I aware 
that any which formerly existed in it are not now to be met with. 
The roe and roebuck are now more numerous than they have been 
owing to the shelter and protection afforded them in the extensive 
plantations on the Redcastle property. The different species of 
ttle now reared in the parish are, horses, cows, hogs, and sheep. 
I he msects which are common to other parts of the country are to 
be met with in this parish. Mussels and whelks are plentiful on our 
side of the Beauly Frith, in the east end of the parish. The mus- 
sels are used by the fishers of the parish of Avoch for bait for their 
small Unes : and both are used for food by the poor people in sum- 
mer when meal is scarce. 

Botany.— There are no very rare natural plants known here. 
There are very large plantations of Scots fir and larch, intermixed 
with hard wood, particularly oak, ash, and birch, on both the pro- 
perties, but chiefly on that of Redcastle. The wood plantations 
are very extensive occupying 2533 imperial acres, 2 roods, and 
14 tails. The plantations are seemingly thriving. Ash, elm, 
beech, and plane trees, of very large dimensions, are also to be met 
witli m various parts of the parish.

in the castle of Kilcoy, now a ruin, but at the time of his birth, the 
seat of that family. The General was the second son of Colin 
Mackenzie of Kilcoy, then the representative of that family. He 
distinguished himself at the siege of Gibraltar in early life ; but his 
character as a military man is so fully known to the public, that it 
is unnecessary to give it here. In several successive Parliaments 
he represented his native county. He died in the rank of Lieute- 
nant- General, regretted, esteemed, and beloved by all who knew 

him. - f u t' l 

There is another distinguished officer, a descendant of the Kil- 
coy family on the maternal side. Lieutenant-- General Sir Kenneth 
Mackenzie, who has lately taken the name of Douglas of Glen- 
bervie. His military character is well known. 

General Sir George Elder was born in this parish, of humble 
but respectable parents, near the Castle of Kilcoy. By his merits 
alone, he overcame all difficulties, and raised himself to his present 
distinguished rank and station. 

Parochial Registers.— The parochial register of this parish has 
been regularly kept from the year 1744. 

Modern Buildings.— There is little in this parish to interest the 
antiquar.y. There are no modern buildings in the parish, except some 
very excellent and substantial farm-houses, built within the last 
twelve years, upon the property of Redcastle. There are two mills 
in the parish, one on each of the properties, where oats, barley, 
pease, and beans are ground, and which pay a yearly rent to the 
proprietors. In ancient times, there were two mansion-houses, 
built in the form of castles, one on each of the properties. In these 
houses, the representatives of the families of Kilcoy and Redcastle 
resided, originally Mackenzies. The Kilcoy Castle, as already 
observed, is now a ruin ; but the castle on the other property, once 
used as a fortification, is at present in an excellent habitable con- 
dition, modernized inside, beautifully situated, and containmg ample 
accommodation for a genteel family. 

in. — Population. 
The population of this parish, according to the census of 1831, 
is 1479. I find an increase of more than an hundred upon the 
whole population upon that of 1821,— notwithstanding of the de- 
population which since then has taken place on the estate of Red- 
castle. This increase arises from the accommodation given by 
Colin Mackenzie of Kilcoy, on his properties in this parish, to te- 
nants removed from the estate of Redcastle; and also, in a more 



KlLLEAllNAN. 

especial manner, from the encouragement which the same gentle- 
man gives to strangers expelled from various parts of the High- 
lands, to settle on his portion of the late Mill-Bui commonty, and 
on other woodlands on his property of Tore,— where they are ac- 
commodated on liberal terms, and where it is expected they may 
make for themselves, in a few years, pretty comfortable settle- 
ments. Those who first settled on these parts of the Kilcoy pro- 
perty after I became minister of this parish are now able to keep 
a horse, a cow, with a follower, and a few sheep. 

The number of families in the parish is . . . 324 

of inhabited houses, . _ _ 293 

of uninhabited houses, - . -4 

of houses building, 4 
The average number of marriages for the last ten years may be from 8 to 10 

of baptisms from . . 16 to 20 

of deaths, . e . _ ] o 

There are three persons blind in the parish : none deaf or dumb. 
The language of the natives is Gaelic; and the greatest portion of 
the inhabitants can receive religious instruction through no other 
medium. The Gaelic, however, may be considered as on the decline. 
Nearly the whole of the young people understand and speak Eng- 
lish well. And of late years, and in consequence of the new system 
of farming introduced, converting large tracts of land into one farm, 
strangers have come amongst us, who do not understand Gaelic, 
and must therefore bring along with them from other parts ser- 
vants who can understand them. The inhabitants are cleanly in 
their habits— industrious and sober— religiously disposed— moral 
in their conduct— teachable and tractable— punctual in their at- 
tendanceof public worship— religiously observing the Sabbath day, 
believing the Divine authority of the Bible, and taking it for the 
rule of their faith and practice. We have a few solitary exceptions, 
but they are few. There is no temptation to poaching ; and smug- 
gling IS almost entirely abandoned. 

Within the last three years, there has been but one illegitimate 
birth in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
The distribution of males among the several employments is as 
follows: farmers, 15; cottars, 119; labourers, 64; employed in 
agriculture in all stations, 1.55; in trade and manufactures, 60; 
1 auctioneer or appraiser; 6 blacksmiths; 5 masons; 7 carpen- 
ters; 1 wheel-wright, above eighty years of age, still found work- 
ing at his turning-loom ; 6 sawers ; 2 millers ; 6 innkeepers, of 
retailers of beer and whisky; 16 shoe and brogue-makers ; 2 shop. 



68 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



keepers; 8 tailors; and 17 weavers. There are about 52 female 
servants in constant service ; and other females in the parish are 
employed by the day, in field labours, by the principal farmers, when 
their services are required, but who, when not so employed, live 
either in houses by themselves, or with their parents, occupying 
their time in spinning flax or wool, of which they make webs for sale, 
and thus contriving to support themselves by their own industry. 

Agriculture. — The improvement in agriculture in this parish, 
within the last sixteen years, has been very great, particularly on 
the estate of Redcastle, where it is now carried on with great spi- 
rit, and in a very substantial manner. The lands are laid out and 
cultivated in the most modern style, and the appearance of the 
fields is now very different, indeed, from what it was even twelve 
years ago. There are now many scores of acres yielding wheat and 
green crops, which were then useless, without any other cover than 
short heath and broom. Both the heritors are liberal in giving en- 
couragement to their tenants in improving waste lands, by allow- 
ing them L. 5 Sterling for every Scots acre they improve, and 
leaving it in their possession during the currency of their lease, with- 
out rent. Nearly the whole arable lands of the estate of Redcastle, 
with a considerable part of the waste lands, are in the possession of 
six principal farmers or tacksmen. These farms are now worked by 
horses, from two to six pair for each farm. The three largest of 
these farms were formerly occupied by small tenants, each paying a 
rent of from L. 12 to L. 60, L. 70 and L. 80. Some twelve or fourteen 
of these small tenants occupied among them what is now in the oc- 
cupancy of one individual. These farms have been laid off with 
regular boundaries, and are subdivided into regular fields. New 
steadings of the most complete description, with comfortable dwel- 
ling-houses, have either been built, are building, or are about to be 
built, on these farms on the Redcastle property. Substantial stone 
dikes have been built, and are building, around the several sub- 
divisions of the farms. Similar improvements are in progress on 
the estate of Kilcoy ; and I understand, that both the tenants 
and the crofters have got leases of from nineteen to twenty-one 
years,— so that when the proposed improvements are completed, 
few parishes will present a more highly cultivated appearance than 
the parish of Killearnan. The principal tenants raise heavy crops of 
wheat, barley, oats, rye, pease, beans, potatoes, turnips, and clover, 
in great abundance. The returns are various, as the season varies. 
If the summer be dry, the returns maybe from three to four; but 



KILLEAllNAN. 



69 



if the summer be warm and rainy, the returns may then be from 
six to eight. 

Bent. — The rent per acre of the large farms may average L. 2 
or L, 2, 2s. The average rent per acre of the Kilcoy lands, 
though not yet so highly cultivated they are liming may be from 
L. 1, 15s. to L. 2. The remuneration of the farmer varies, of 
course, with the markets. 

There are no fish-curers in this parish, — though a few boats 
go every season for a few months to the Caithness herring fish- 
ing, at great risk, and with great previous out-fits ; they succeed 
pretty well some seasons, and at other times they return with con- 
siderable loss. 

The principal farmers rear upon their own farms, their own 
horses and cattle, necessary for the farming purposes ; from which 
stock, they are able to sell a yearly portion of each kind. In the 
end of harvest, they buy a good many young cattle for the con- 
sumption of their straw, and sell them at the summer markets, 
sometimes with considerable profit. They also buy in cattle and 
sheep for feeding oa turnip, for the fleshers at Inverness. The 
sheep are fed in folds on the field ; and the cattle are fed in stalls 
in their squares. 

Produce. — The average amount and value of raw produce year- 
ly raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as fol- 
lows : 

Wheat, 270 Scots acres, giving 7 imperial bolls each acre, the average 

price for the last three years being L. 1, 4s. each boll, . L. 1950 0 0 

Barley, 1 40 acres, at 3 imperial quarters each, average price for the last 

three years L. 1 , 8s. per quarter, .... 980 0 0 

Oats and rye, 290 Scots acres, at 3 imperial quarters each acre, average 

price for the last three years, L. 1, Is. each, equal to . 1522 JO 0 

Turnip, 100 Scots acres, at L. 3 each acre, . . . 500 0 0 

Potatoes. 60 Scots acres, at L. 6 eacli acre, . . . 360 0 0 

Clover for hay, 410 acres, valued at L. 5 per acre, . , 2000 0 0 

Pastured yearly by 430 cows, the remaining arable at L. 4 each, besides 

the working horses and some young ones sold, with sheep and pigs, 300 0 0 
Annual thinnings of woods and quarries may be equal, with garden re-

Manvfactures. — There are no manufactures of any description 
carried on in this parish. Only, individuals purchase wool and 
flax, — dress and spin it, — get it weaved in the parish, — clothe 
themselves by it, — and the remainder not so used is sold at the 
public markets. 

Navigation. — There are no ships, the property of individuals re- 
siding in the parish, employed in trade, except two : a schooner

and a sloop belonging to the tacksman of Lettoch have been; 
within the last eight years, employed by him in the timber and 
coal trade betwixt this and Newcastle. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — There are no market-towns in the 
parish ; and the nearest market-town is Inverness. We have no 
post-office ; no bridges, properly so called ; no canals or rail-roads ; 
no harbours, properly speaking, though vessels of a considerable 
tonnage can safely load and unload on the shore of the east end of 
the parish. We have a good turnpike road passing through the 
eastern extremity of the parish, from the Ferry at Kessock to 
Dingwall, Invergordon, and Fortrose, — upon which a toll-bar is 
placed, and upon which carriages of every description pass. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is every thing but com- 
fortable as a place of worship. It was originally built, some hun- 
dred years ago, in the form of a cross ; and in that form it now 
stands. It is large enough to contain the population of the pa- 
rish. It was first thatched with heather; but, upwards of forty 
years ago, it was raised on the walls, newly roofed, slated and seat- 
ed ; but, in opposition to the then minister's wishes, the heritors 
continued its former Popish form. The present heritors seem not 
less attached to this relic of Popery than their predecessors. They 
lately added to the former props supporting the decayed galleries, 
ten new additional props of planted wood, — removing the decayed 
parts of the sarking, and splicing the rotten ends of some of the 
couples. In short, the church is a most uncomfortable place of 
worship, and most ruinous to the health of the incumbent, as it is 
said to have been to that of his predecessors. Even such as it is, 
there is no free sitting in it, even for the very poor. — The manse 
was first built about a hundred years ago. It has received the 
addition of a back wing and some repairs, since the present incum- 
bent was admitted ; and yet, it is far from being either comfort- 
able or commodious; and, were it not for the incumbent's own 
outlays upon it, he would have had little satisfaction in it. The 
glebe may be from 5 to 6 acres, all arable — no pasture. There 
is, in addition to this glebe, the one-half of the glebe of Kilmuir 
Wester, belonging to the minister of Killearnan. This arose from 
a disjunction of the three parishes of Suddy, Kilmuir Wester, and 
Killearnan, which took place in 1756, — when the two parishes of 
Killearnan and Kilmuir Wester and Suddy were formed from the 
former three ; and when the stipend of the three parishes was equal- 



KILLEARNAN. 



71 



ly divided between the present two. The stipend of Killearnan has 
been, ever since, 145 bolls of barley, 51 bolls of meal, and L. 8, 
4s. 2d. of money, without any allowance for communion elements. 
It is now the smallest stipend in the Synod of Ross ; and there are 
no means for augmenting it, as no vacant teinds were left in this 
parish, when the annexation took place. There are no chapels, 
belonging to any other denomination than that of the Established 
Church, in this parish, — though a few of the parishioners attend 
a Scots Episcopal chapel in the parish of Kilmuir Wester and 
Suddy, built upon the property of AUangrange. The people are 
generally a church-going people. There is a catechist in the 
parish, supported by the interest of L. 300, funded for the purpose 
from the stipend of the parish which had accumulated during a 
vacancy of eight years, while the right of presentation was liti- 
gated between the Crown and the Honourable Mrs Hay Macken- 
zie of Cromarty, before the Court of Session and the House of 
Peers. The process was finally decided by the House of Peers in 
favour of the Honourable Mrs Hay Mackenzie, in the month of 
July 1814. The communicants of this parish are 150 in number, 
including the elders. 

We have had a quarterly collection in the parish, during the last 
twelve years, for missionary purposes, — which may amount yearly 
to from L. 8 to L. 12. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, — the parochial 
school, and one endowed by the Society in Scotland for Propa- 
gating Christian Knowledge. We have, besides, a female school, 
taught on the second patent of the same Honourable Society. In 
the parochial school, the following branches are taught, viz. mathe- 
matics, book-keeping, mensuration, Greek, Latin, English, writ- 
ing, Gaelic, geography, English grammar, &amp;c. In the Society's 
school, are taught English, Gaelic, translating English into Gaelic, 
writing, arithmetic, and book-keeping. The attendance at each 
school is from 80 to 100. The salary of the parochial school, in- 
cluding the legal allowance for a garden, is nearly L. 30. The 
salary of the society schoolmaster, along with a small croft free of 
rent, is only L. 1 5. The schoolmistress gets L. 5. The quarter- 
ly charge for school fees may be from Is. to 4s. The children of 
the poor are taught gratis : and the good effects of early education 
is seen in the industry, sobriety, and good conduct of our youth. 

Poor. — The number of persons in the parish receiving paro- 
chial aid is betwixt 60 and 70 ; they receive yearly from 6s. to 12s.

each. The collections at church, in their behalf, may amount to 
L. 24 or L. 30 a-year. 

Fairs. — We have two public fairs held, each year, in the months 
of March and July. 

Fuel. — The principal fuel used by the poor, are, peats, turf, the 
roots of broom, branches of trees, and some coals. Coals are al - 
ways used by the more wealthy portion of the inhabitants, — for 
•which they pay from Is. 6d. to 2s. the Scots barrel, or from Is. to 
Is. 2d. the imperial barrel. The coals are brought from Newcastle.

PRESBYTEKY OF LOCHCARRON, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. THOMAS ROSS, LL.D. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Situation, and Extent. — The parish of Lochbroom de- 
rives its name from a fresh water lake of about 3 Scotch miles in 
length, and 1 in breadth, at the distance of from 12 to 15 miles 
from the sea, — which, being surrounded by high hills, and conse- 
quently much visited by the moisture of the passing clouds, is 
known by the very characteristic appellation of Loch-a' Bhraoin, 
or the Lake of Showers ; Braon, or Braom, in Gaelic, signifying 
a shower, or drizzle of rain. The same name of Broom is, from 
this lake, also communicated to the river, which flows from it 
through a considerable part of the parish, and to the great arm of 
the sea into which that river falls near the parish church. 

The parish is bounded on the west by the channel called the 
Minsh, which separates the island of Lewis from the mainland of 
Scotland. It has the parish of Assint on the north ; the parishes 
of Kincardine and Contiu on the east ; and the parish of Gairloch 
on the south. 

The figure of the parish is exceedingly irregular, a great part 
of it consisting of a variety of promontories of very different ex- 
tent and appearance, and separated from each other by lochs and 
creeks and inlets of the sea. The distance, in a straight line, be- 
tween the extreme points of the western boundary, is not more 
than from 22 to 24 miles, yet within that space of direct latitude 
there are included above 100 miles of shore washed by the ocean. 



LOCHBROOM. 



73 



The inland boundaries are almost equally irregular, so that the 
extent in square miles is utterly unknown, and will probably con- 
tinue to be so. It may, however, be very safely affirmed, that, in 
regard to extent of territory and number of inhabitants, and diffi- 
culty of the ground, and natural divisions, the parish of Lochbroom 
alone independently of the village of Ullapool, in which there is 
a Government church, would form four large parishes, which would 
furnish ample scope for the exertions of four able and active paro- 
chial ministers. It may be proper to add, that, if the parish of 
Lochbroom were divided into four such distinct parishes, having 
churches planted at the most suitable distances, with ministers in 
each, there would still be many persons in these parishes who would 
require to travel from five to fifteen miles, of very difficult road, be- 
fore they could obtain any of the sealing ordinances of religion. 
It may be further observed, that, in this parish, there are seven 
cemeteries, or public burying-grounds ; eight stations in which the 
minister thinks it his duty though not obliged to preach occa- 
sionally — always in the open air — yet always to larger congrega- 
tions than on ordinary occasions meet in the parish church ; eight- 
een stations, at which from 45 to 220 scholars could assemble for 
instruction, if they were blessed with teachers, — besides several 
hundreds, who could only meet in tens, and fifteens, and twenties ; 
and finally, that in this parish alone, there are above 1300 young 
people — all poor — who are either receiving, or require to receive, 
instruction in the first principles of an useful education. 

Surface, General Appearance, and Natural Divisions. — To a 
spectator placed on an eminence in the inland part of this parish, 
the appearance is that of a wide and dreary waste of bleak and 
barren heath, as if a segment of the great ocean, agitated and 
tossed, and tumbled, not by an ordinary storm, however violent, 
but by some frightful convulsion of nature, with here and there a 
rude and lofty peak of rugged rock, towering to the skies, — had 
been suddenly condensed, and formed into a solid shapeless mass 
of unproductive desert, without one spot of green on which to rest 
the eye. On descending from the heights, however, and advan- 
cmg towards the sea, the ground assumes a very different, and more 
pleasing aspect. Here, along the shores of the ocean, on the 
sides of the great arms of the sea by which the parish is intersect- 
ed, and the rich valleys which extend far among the hills, the eye 
is refreshed by the sight of fertile fields, and populous hamlets, 
with numerous flocks and herds, and woods, and water streams. 



74 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



The parish is divided into four districts, viz. The Aird, or height 
of Coigach, Lochbroom Proper, the Little Strath, and the Laigh. 
The appearance from the sea, in a clear summer evening, is mag- 
nificent beyond description. 

Rivers, Lakes, and Fish. — In Coigach, are the beautiful vales of 
Strathceannard and Rhidorch, watered, the former, by the water 
of Ceannard, and the latter, by the finely wooded lake of Achall, 
and the river of Ceannchruinn or Ullapool. Lochbroom is divid- 
ed into what are called the Big and Little Straths ; through the 
former of which, flows the rapid river Broom, from the mountain 
lake already mentioned, which gives its name to the parish, till it 
falls into the Big Loch, below the parish church. Through the 
latter, runs the Little Broom, fed by a number of mountain streams, 
into the Little Loch, about a mile below the House of Dun- 
donnell. 

The Laigh is watered by the Meikle river, which pours the 
waters of Loch-na'-sealg, a beautiful sheet of fresh water, six 
Scotch miles in length, and of many other lakes and rivulets into 
the sea at Greenyard, — and by the little river of Greenyard, which 
forms the boundary of the parish on the south. All these streams 
are well stocked with salmon, grilse, trout, and other kinds of fish. 

Coast, Mountains, and Islands. — It has been already mentioned 
that the parish of Lochbroom possesses a very great extent of shore. 
But this is chiefly formed by the bays and deep inlets of the sea, 
by which the land is intersected. Along the coast of the Atlantic, 
the shore is bold, rocky, and precipitous, consisting of the pro- 
montories of More or Great, Riff", Dunan, Duard, Ardchaduill, 
Handerick or Cailleach, and Stadaig. But the heads of the 
lochs or bays are chiefly low and sandy. The principal mountains 
are Stac, Cumhill-Mhor, and Big Rock, in Coigach, on the 
north ; Beinn-Deirg on the east ; Fannich on the south-east ; and 
the hills of Strath- na'sealg on the south-west. But their eleva- 
tion above the sea is uncertain. There are several islands be- 
longing to the parish, off" the coast. Some of them are inhabited, 
as Ristal, Tanara, Isle Martin, Isle Greenyard, and sometimes 
the Priest Island. The others, called the Summer Isles, are ex- 
cellent for wintering young Highland cattle. The hills of this 
parish were well stored with game of all kinds, till the introduc- 
tion of extensive sheep-farming, which has greatly diminished the 
quantity of game, as well as of salmon and other fish in the lakes 
arid rivers. The same circumstance has had an equally deleteri-

LOCHBROOM.

ous effect on the growing woods of the country in general, — and 
also on its race of heroes. « 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere, though ex- 
ceedingly changeable, is rather moderate and mild ; neither so high 
in summer, nor so low in winter, as on the eastern coast of the 
island, in Cromarty, Leith, or even London. The mercury in the 
thermometer perhaps never falls below 16°, nor rises above 74°, 
Fahrenheit. In the barometer, it runs over the whole range, from 
28 to 31, sometimes beyond it; and it has been often seen to fall 
or rise a full inch and more, in the course of one day. The climate 
is certainly moist, and much rain falls from the one end of the year 
to the other ; yet more harm is done to the crop, on the whole, by 
dry weather than by excessive rain. Rainbows by the sun and the 
moon are frequently observed. Of the latter, a most beauti- 
ful instance occurred on Thursday the 24th of October 1833, 
at 8 o'clock p. M., forming a magnificent arch over the whole 
of the Big Loch, from side to side, such as Telford never con- 
structed. The Polar Lights are often exceedingly grand and bril- 
liant. The prevailing wind is the south-west, which almost always 
brings foul weather. There seem to be no diseases which can be 
said to be peculiar to the country; but consumption, and obstinate 
constipation of the bowels, are the most prevalent distempers among 
the people. In the year 1812, the parish was visited by small-pox 
in the natural way, which carried off almost all that were attacked 
by it. But the minister got the people, by much persuasion, to 
agree to have their children inoculated. A physician was accord- 
ingly called in, who inoculated from 900 to 1000 young people, 
out of which number only 5 died. Vaccination has been partially 
used ; but the small-pox has not since prevailed in the parish. 

Hydrographj.—Theve is little to be said on this head. The 
lochs, rivers, and lakes have been already noticed. There are some 
beautiful cascades in the parish, as may well be supposed from the 
nature of the ground, and the quantity of rain which falls upon it, 
but none of them of sufficient importance to merit a particular 
description here. There are also many mineral springs, which are 
chiefly of a chalybeate nature. 

Geology. — Old red sandstone forms extensive tracts in this pa- 
rish, as Coigach and other parts on the mainland, and the Sum- 
mer and other islands along the coast. Quartz rock abounds in 
some quarters, and Beinn Deirg on the east, Fannich on the south- 
east, and other mountains, are chiefly composed of gneiss, with 



76 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



veins of granite, beds of quartz rock, &amp;c. A bed of limestone 
appears in the Little Strath, passes under the Big Loch to Ul- 
lapool, from which it runs into the beautiful and magnificent 
marble quarries of Assint. But, from the difficulty of the ground, 
and the scarcity of fuel, little use is made of it here. On the 
farm of Scorraig, the property of Dundonnell, . there is a prodi- 
gious quantity of bog-iron ore, which s,eems to be of the sub-spe- 
cies of meadow-ore. It communicates a strong and harsh chaly- 
beate taste, to all the springs of water in the neighbourhood. The 
soil in this parish, as may be supposed from its great extent and 
different degrees of elevation and distance from the sea, is exceed- 
ingly various ; but the prevailing character is that of a light, sharp, 
gravelly loam, well adapted to produce the ordinary crops of oats, 
barley, and. potatoes. Wheat also has been tried in it, and an- 
swered remarkably well. 

Zoology. — On this head there is little to be said. The animals 
which were generally found in wild mountain districts, abounded 
long ago on the hills of Lochbroom : Deer, roe,- hare, rabbit, 
ptarmigan, grouse, black game, wild pigeons, sheep, goats, horses 
of a small size, but hardy, and cows. The race of wolves has been 
extirpated; but reynard contrives to keep his ground in spite of 
every effort to expel him, and often commits sad ravages among 
the sheep. The hens he scorns, as also the ducks of the poultry- 
yard, and leaves them to the meaner tricks, but not less rapacious 
fangs, of fumarts, martins, and wild-cats. Badgers are found among 
the lower grounds, partridges in the fields, and abundance of ot- 
ters along the shores of the sea, and the banks of the rivers and 
lakes. 

Of fishes, besides salmon, grilse, and trout, there are perch, 
pike, eel, and minnows, to be found in some of the rivers and lakes 
of the parish. The salmon come up to spawn in autumn. But, alas  
it is much to be feared, that but very few of them are allowed to 
return to their briny element; being intercepted by lawless and mer- 
ciless poachers. The fishes which frequent the sea coasts of the 
parish are too numerous to be particularly noticed. But the her- 
rings cannot be passed over in silence, being the great staple of 
the country. 

Of herrings, prodigious shoals appear off the coast of Lochbroom, 
often as early as the month of May ; but they pass on towards the 
south, and do not strike into the lochs and arms of the sea, so as 
to be productive of much benefit to the country, sooner than the

month of September. From that time, their appearance, though 
exceedingly irregular, is anxiously looked for, till the month of Fe- 
bruary. Great is the preparation made, and much the expense incur- 
red, engrossing even the little all of most of the poor families along 
the coast — to meet and' profit by the expected bounty. When the 
herrings set fairly in, at a proper season, and when they continue 
for a considerable time within the lochs and bays, the benefit is very 
great. The herrings of this coast are of the very best kind — the 
people are instantly afloat, with every species of seaworthy craft — 
numerous crews from all parts of the east and west coasts of Scot- 
land, and even from Ireland, press forward with the utmost eager- 
ness to the field of slaughter — sloops, schooners, wherries, boats 
of all sizes, are seen constantly flying on the wings of the wind, from 
creek to creek, and from loch to loch, according as the varying re- 
ports of men, or the noisy flight of birds, or tumbling and spout- 
ing of whales and porpoises, attract them. Hundreds of boats are 
seen to start at day-set for the watery field, they silently shoot their 
nets, lie out at the end of their train, all night, and return in the 
morning full of life and spirit, to sell or cure their cargoes. The 
scene is extremely animated and interesting. And when there is 
a successful fishing, it is important, in a national, as well as in an 
individual point of view. For some years back, however, the take 
has not been great, and much loss has been sustained. 

Of insects, the most injurious to fruit and garden vegetables, in 
this parish, has been the caterpillar; and the only means which 
the writer of this has found effectual in preventing their depreda- 
tions, has been to pick them off" the leaves as soon as they appear, by 
the fingers of young people, and put them into small dishes contain- 
ing a little water, to be carried away and destroyed. And although 
this method may appear, at first sight, an endless work, particular- 
ly in a large establishment, it is by no means so. Let the work be 
boldly and perseveringly attempted, and it will infallibly succeed. 

Of shell-fish, we have great varieties, many of which, such as 
oysters, cockles, mussels, spout-fish, &amp;c. are most useful to many 
of the poor people near the shores, who, in a great measure, sub- 
sist upon them during the summer season, when meal is scarce or 
exhausted. Great numbers of crabs and lobsters also are taken 
among the islands, and along the coast, which are carried in smacks 
to the London market. 

Botany. — This parish was once thickly covered with woods of 
various descriptions of trees; chiefly Scotch fir, ash, elm, oak, birch, 



78 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



alder, mountain-ash, willow, poplar and hazel. There are still some 
beautiful trees of oak, ash, birch, geen, bird-cherry, and mountain- 
ash, with some small thriving plantations of fir, in the Little Strath, 
about Dundonnell House and Mains ; and a few old ash trees about 
the village of Ullapool, and firs in the glen of Achall. But with 
these exceptions, and some few alders, growing at the sides of 
rivers, in the glens, the parish is nearly denuded of wood. 

The soil and climate, however, are exceedingly favourable to the 
growth of wood of all kinds which are common to this country; as 
may be seen by passing through the glebe, where firs of different 
kinds, and hard wood, and fruit-trees, planted by the present in- 
cumbent, have succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectations. 
Of fruits in particular, viz. apples, pears, plumbs, cherries, Spanish 
filberts, walnuts, currants, gooseberries, of many different kinds, he 
can shew samples which he has not seen exceeded in any part of 
the country ; all on standards, in the open air. The culinary plants 
committed to the soil produce the best returns. 

II. — Civil History. 

Of the ancient history of this parish very little is known, — there 
being no printed or manuscript accounts of it in existence, so far as 
the present writer is aware. Yet there have been men of genius 
and talents connected with it 

Eminent Men. — Norman M'Leod, alias Tormaid Ban the au- 
thor of the well known song of Caberfeidh, and of many other very 
popular and highly poetical productions, was a native of this parish, 
and father of the late minister of Rogart in Sutherland, and of 
Professor M'Leod, late Regent of the University of Glasgow. 

Murdoch M'Leod, also alias Murcha MIain 'Ic Uilliam 
another poet of great merit, was a native of this parish. He was bred 
to the Episcopal church, but never took orders, nor obtained a set- 
tlement. He was nearly related to the best families in Coigach and 
Assint, among whom he spent his time composing spiritual hymns, 
which are yet remembered, and held in the highest estimation. A 
printed copy of them would be an inestimable present to the High- 
lands. 

The Rev. James Robertson, from the district of Athole, who 
was settled minister of Lochbroom, shortly before the Rebellion of 
1745, was a man of uncommon strength of body, and firmness of 
mind ; eminently suited to the times in which he lived, and to the 
state and character of the people among whom he was placed ; and 
highly deserving of being recorded in any annals of this parish. 



LOCHBROOM. 



79 



Mr Robertson was born about the year 1701; and soon after ob- 
taining license as a preacher, was appointed assistant to the Rev. 
Donald Ross, minister of this parish. On the translation of Mr Ross 
to Fearn, Mr Robertson was recommended as his successor, by the 
Duke of Athole, to the Earl of Cromarty, the patron of the pa- 
rish. His Lordship, however, was so much occupied, at that time, 
in preparations for the Rebellion which broke out in 1745, 
that the presentation was not lodged with the Moderator of the 
Presbytery till after the expiry of six months from the commence- 
ment of the vacancy; in consequence of which, the presbytery pro- 
ceeded on the jus devolidum, and bestowed the living on Mr Ro- 
derick M'Kenzie, a native of the parish, and nearly related to se- 
veral of the heritors. But the influence of the Duke of Athole and 
of the Earl of Cromarty, at that period, was not to be resisted. 
The presbytery was obliged to yield. Mr M'Kenzie was deprived 
of the parish, and Mr Robertson was inducted in his place. He 
was a powerful and evangehcal preacher, and laboured, with much 
earnestness and zeal, among his niunerous and semi-barbarous pa- 
rishioners,— whose grosser delinquencies he had often occasion to 
visit with the weight of his tremendous arm, as well as with the spi- 
ritual weapons of his Christian warfare. 

Soon after his settlement, Mr Robertson, while on a visit to his 
predecessor at Fearn, was present in the church of that parish, a 
Gothic building, covered with large gray flags in place of slates, 
when, during Divine service, the roof came suddenly down upon the 
congregation, throwing out the walls with irresistible force. Mr 
Robertson remaining unhurt, made directly for the principal door, 
and seeing the lintel ready to give way, he placed his shoulder 
under the end of it, and stood in that position till as many of the 
people as could move, escaped. He then extricated his friend, al- 
most suffocated under the canopy of the pulpit, and a mass of stones 
and rubbish. For this extraordinary feat of strength, he was always 
afterwards called, « Am Ministeir Ididir," the strong minister. 

When the Rebellion of 1745 broke out, he had the misfortune 
to find that his patron and other heritors were decidedly favourable 
to the exiled family,— by which means, the far greater number of his 
parishioners, in spite of all his remonstrances, became involved in 
the guiltf their superiors and landlords. His own loyalty, how- 
ever, remained unshaken, and by his persuasion and influence, 
many were deterred from throwing off" their allegiance. 

On the return of the victorious Highlanders from the battle of

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Falkirk, Lord Loudon, accompanied by Lord President Forbes, 
abandoned the town and county of Inverness, withdrew to Suther- 
land, and being desirous to pursue a secret route, through the vast 
mountains of that county and of Lochbroom, to join the Macdo- 
nalds and M'Leods, now wavering in their opinions, and stationed 
between Skye and the mainland of Lochalsh and Glenelg ; aware 
of the danger of such a journey, through a waste, rugged, and hos- 
tile country ; and well knowing the steady loyalty, and sagacious 
zeal of the minister of Lochbroom, — he dispatched a confidential 
messenger to Mr Robertson, bearing dispatches to the commanders 
of the new levies above-mentioned, intimating his intention of join- 
ing them, and the route he was to take, and directing that provi- 
sions and accommodations should be furnished for his reception. 
The messenger delivered his dispatches at the manse of Loch- 
broom, and Mr Robertson instantly forwarded them by a trusty per- 
son, who carried them in safety to the place of their destination. 

The news immediately transpired, that a stranger from Suther- 
land had arrived at the manse, and Mr Robertson and the messenger 
were both arrested, and brought before the commanding officer of 
a party of Highlanders, stationed near the manse. But here 
he acquitted himself with his usual coolness and presence of mind ; 
and after a night's confinement, was liberated. This bold, but suc- 
cessful, measure, was the salvation of Lord Loudon and his whole 
corps — perhaps the means of the ultimate triumph of the royal 
cause. 

In a few days after. Lord Loudon, with his detachment, and 
the Lord President, arrived at Lochbroom, and was hospitably en- 
tertained for a night, with all his suite, by this intrepid clergyman. 
Soon after the battle of CuUoden, he waited on the Duke of Cum- 
berland, at Inverness. His Royal Highness received him gracious- 
ly, thanked him for his zeal and services, and ordered twelve stand 
of arms to be given to him, to be put into the hands of such per- 
sons as he might think worthy of being entrusted with them. He 
also carried on a regular and confidential correspondence with him, 
during the whole of his Royal Highness's stay in the north. 

But whatever confidence was placed in this excellent man, and 
whatever favours he was entitled to ask for his important services 
to his King and country, he employed all, not for the aggrandize- 
ment of his own family, but for the benefit of his deluded, though 
often obstreperous and ungrateful, parishioners. When the trial of 
these unhappy men, who were taken prisoners in 1746, came on, 



LOCHBUOOM.

Mr Robertson set out on a journey of 700 miles, to London an 
arduous undertaking at that time, at his own private expense, 
that he might use all his influence in their behalf. He arrived, 
while Hector Mackenzie, a retainer of the Earl of Cromarty, 
and a respectable man, was on his trial; and to his unspeakable 
mortification, in spite of all his interest and exertions, Mackenzie 
was condemned. But the " Ministear Laidir" was not thus to be 
put off. He went directly to the Duke of Newcastle, and earnest- 
ly entreated his intercession with the Sovereign, for mercy to the 
condemned criminal. The Duke received him favourably, and 
satisfied him with a fair promise, that the man's life would be spar- 
ed. He was, however, soon alarmed, by a hint from some of his 
friends, that such promises by the Duke were not always to be re- 
lied on ; and worked his honest way again into the presence of his 
Grace, where he earnestly renewed his intercession. The Duke, 
to get rid of his importunity, renewed his promise, with the offer 
of his hand. The minister grasped his hand in his own awful fist, 
and gave it such a squeeze, that his Grace in agony, exclaimed,' 
Yes, yes, yes  Mr Robertson, you shall have him, you shall 
have him." This promise was not to be forgotten, and the man 
was saved. 

During many of the subsequent trials, Mr Robertson was em- 
ployed as interpreter, in the taking of the evidence of witnesses ; in 
which capacity, from his intimate knowledge of the Highland cha- 
racter, and of the arts which had been practised upon his people, 
he was able so to direct the course of the examination, that he both 
served the cause of truth, and the best interests of the country, 
and rescued many a victim of folly and delusion from a violent and 
ignominious death. 

While thus detained in London, Mr Robertson one day, in cross- 
mg the Thames in a boat, was assailed by a loud voice from a hulk 
then lymg in the river, with these words, in the Gaelic language, 
VIZ. " 0 / a Mhaisteir Seumas, am bheil thu' g'am fhdgaih' an so" 
O  Mr James, are you going to leave me here  Mr Robertson 
mstantly recognizing the speaker, answered, « Ah  a Dhdnuil 
hheil cuimhn agad air U na biodaig r i. e. Ah  Donald, do yon 
remember the day of the dirk The despairing culprit replied, 
" Oc/i a Mhaisteir Seumas, is oh an t-dite cuimhnachan so." i. e. 
Oh  Mr James, bad place of remembrance is this. The conver- 
sation ceased. The speaker was a Donald Mackenzie, a bold and 
powciful man, well known to Mr Robertson as a quondam parish-

ionev. The ruffian bad, a few years before, come to the minister for 
baptism to a child, which, as he was grossly ignorant, was inflexibly 
refused. The fellow, after repeated refusals, till he should exhi- 
bit some suitable qualification, resolved to extort by force, what he 
could not obtain by solicitation, prevailed on a neighbour of his, 
another rude and athletic Highlander, to accompany and assist him 
in this unprincipled attempt. They found the minister at some 
distance from the manse, when Donald renewed his suit for bap- 
tism to his child. But after a short examination, he was found 
as unqualified as ever, and positively refused. Upon which, the 
two fellows laid violent hands on the minister, swearing that they 
would never let him go till he would comply with the request. A 
desperate struggle ensued, and Donald, perceiving that the minis- 
ter was stronger than himself and his neighbour, drew his dirk, 
and inflicted a deep wound on Mr Robertson's right arm, notwith- 
standing which, he beat the two, and sent Donald home again to 
study his catechism. 

The day of retribution for the violence of the dirk was come, 
and Mr Robertson, in the true spirit of his holy calling, lost no 
time in employing all his influence in favour of the desponding 
criminal. His exertions were attended with success. Poor Do- 
nald received a free pardon, returned home to his native country, 
and lived for many years, the most attached and grateful parish- 
ioner of his reverend benefactor. It may be added, that Mr Ro- 
bertson returned to his parish, and to the most grateful and ad- 
miring affections of his people of all ranks, among whom he lived 
for nearly thirty years after, in the zealous, diligent, and success- 
ful discharge of his ministerial duties. 

Soon after the battle of Culloden, a squadron of King's ves- 
sels, under the command of one Ferguson, appeared off the coast 
of this parish, and dropped anchor in Loch Ceannard. A strong 
party landed there, and proceeded up the strath, as far as the re- 
sidence of Mr M'Kenzie of Langwell, who was married to a near 
relative of Earl George of Cromarty. Mr M'Kenzie got out of 
the way ; but the lady was obliged to attend some of her children, 
who were confined by small-pox. The house was ransacked, a 
trunk containing valuable papers, and among them a wadset of 
Lano-well, and Inchvennie, from the Earl of Cromarty, was burnt 
before her eyes ; and about fifty head of black-cattle were 
mangled by their swords, and driven away to the ships. Simi- 
lar depredations were committed in the neighbourhood, without

discrimination of friends or enemies, during eight days that they 
remained upon the coast. 

Land-oitners. — The hmded proprietors of the parish are, tlie 
Hon. Mrs Hay M'Kenzie of Cromertie; Mr Davidson of Tulloch ; 
Mr MKenzie of Dundonnell ; Sir George M'Kenzie of Coul ; and 
Captain Fraser of Balnain. None of these reside within the pa- 
rish. Neither are there other famihes of any note residing in it. 
They all possess land to the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

Parochial Eeffisters. —There are no pai'ochial registers within 
ihe parish, further back than the year 1808,— the date of the pre- 
sent incumbent's induction. 

Antiquities.— There are many of the drystone -circular build- 
mgs called Duis, in this parish; but there is no tradition of their 
origin or use. 

Modern Buildings.— Thereh nothing, under this head, worth no- 
ticmg, except the parish church, which was built i« 1816-17. It is 
an excellent house, seated for 1200, but capable of containino- 
nearly 2000 sitters. The manse was built in 181 2 ; and isin great 
need of repair. There is a very comfortable mansion-house on the 
property of Dundonnell, greatly enlarged and improved by the 
late proprietor, Kenneth M'Kenzie. 

HI. — Population. 

According to Dr Weteter's return in 175n, tlie population was 2211 
By returns to Sir John Sinclair about 1794, q v A 

At the last census in 1831, " " .t ,. 

Making an increase since tlie former Account of | 115 

In fact, however, the number of inhabitants actually belono-in 
to the parish, at the time of the last census, must have been con- 
siderably greater than that given in. For, by a very correct enu- 
meration, taken by the present incumbent in 1824," in which the 
name and surname of every individual in the parish are inserted 
the number of inhabitants then in the parish was 4747,-beinff 132 
more than in the last census, although the population has undoubt- 
edly been gradually and rapidly increasing for a hundred years back. 

Ihe discrepancy, however, is easily accounted for, in full con- 
sistency with the accuracy of the last Report. For, the act of 
Parliament of 830 requiring, that the population of the whole 
kmgdom should be taken at one and the same time, it became ne- 
cessary to return the number of persons then actually within the 
parishes, rather than the number of persons which fairly belonged 
to ttiem. And by this means, some hundreds of the parishioners 



84 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



of Loclibroom, away at sea, at the Caithness and deep-sea fish- 
ings, and at south-country labouring of various kinds, must have 
been omitted in their own, and returned from other parishes. 

The population returns of 1831 are as follows : viz. males, 2214, 
females, 2401, total, 4615. Males above twenty years of age, 1065 ; 
families, 938; inhabited houses, 917; houses building, 6 ; houses un- 
inhabited, 5 ; occupiers of land, 572 ; employed in retail and trade, 96. 
Average of baptisms for the lastseven years, 1 19 ; of marriages, 241. 

The real population of the parish of Lochbroom, as correctly 
ascertained in November 1834, is 5206 ; of which 2546 are males, 
and 2660 are females. 

Character and Habits of the PeopZe.— There is nothing very re- 
markable in the appearance, character, or habits of the people. 
The language generally spoken is Gaelic ; but it is evidently los- 
ing ground. The people are in general sober and quiet ; but when 
an opportunity occurs, as at a wedding, or even a funeral, it can- 
not be denied that some of them occasionally exceed the bounds 
of perfect moderation. They are in general very poor. Their or- 
dinary food consists chiefly of potatoes and fish ; and it must be 
admitted that the strength of body, and daring spirit for which the 
Highlanders were once justly celebrated, are greatly on the decline. 
They cannot be entirely acquitted of poaching in game or salmon ; 
nor is the country entirely free from the degrading and demoraliz- 
ing practice of smuggling whisky. But this is greatly owing to the 
proprietors or their factors. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture.— The number of acres in the parish, cultivated or 
uncultivated, has never been ascertained. The black-cattle rear- 
ed in the parish are small, but hardy. The original small sheep 
of the country were, about forty years ago, supplanted by the black- 
faced, and these are now fast yielding to the white-faced or Cheviot 
breeds. There is truly little to be said in commendation of the 
farm-buildings and enclosures of the parish ; but the labouring 
implements have certainly been much improved. When the present 
incumbent entered on his charge in the year 1808, there were only 
two coup-carts in the whole parish, and perhaps not one low coun- 
try made plough. But now, where there is arable land to culti- 
vate, both are universally used. 

The principal improvements which have been made in the pa- 
rish were executed by the late Kenneth M'Kenzie, Esq. of Dun- 
donnell This gentleman, brother-in-law to the writer, had been 



I.OCHBllOOM. 



85 



for some years abroad and in the army, and succeeded his father, 
George M'Kenzie, in the year 1816. Being left a free estate 
worth L. 1600 a-year, and some thousand pounds in money, he soon 
came home, settled on his property, completely changed the whole 
system of management which had been previously followed, intro- 
duced a superior breed of cattle, for which he had a fine taste; bought 
valuable horses, with corresponding implements of husbandry, and 
harness ; greatly enlarged and improved his mansion-house, built a 
fine square of offices, enclosed a large piece of ground for a gar- 
den, with a wall of stone and lime, ten or twelve feet high, which 
he laid out in the most tasteful manner, and stocked with a rich 
variety of fruit trees and bushes, as well as flowering shrubs and 
flowers ; recovered many acres of waste land ; opened up the coun- 
try by new roads ; built hundreds of yards of stone dikes ; planted 
miUions of firs and hard- wood trees; and in every way beautified and 
adorned his own romantic little strath. He died at the age of 36, 
and left no children behind him,  

There are few leases given in this parish, except to the princi- 
pal sheep-farmers, and these are from fifteen to nineteen years. 
The farm-buildings and enclosures in the parish, except those at 
Dundonnell already mentioned, are mean and worthless. The pro- 
prietors will lay out nothing on their lands, nor will they allow me- 
liorations to their tenants, even for substantial improvements. The 
state of the parish, therefore, in regard to improvement, may easily 
be imagined. 

Fisheries.— The herring fishery has been already noticed. There 
are salmon killed on the rivers of Ullapool, Meikle and Little 
Broom, and Greenyard. 

Manufactures.— There is no manufacture of any consequence 

_ • These improvements had contributed to involve Dundonnell deeply in debt His 
younger brother andhe.r-at.law, was in such circumstances as rendeS t impossible 
for him to clear the estate, or to retain it. It was settled past him, but burdened with

carried on in this parish. Even the manufacture of kelp, which 
was once a source of considerable profit, is now discontinued, since 
the duty on barilla was taken off, and the raw material is used only 
as manure for the land. 

Navigation. — There is no navigable river in this parish, nor any 
foreign trade carried on with it ; and there are but two or three 
small sloops at the port of Ullapool, which ply between that place 
and Greenock, Liverpool, and Ireland. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is no market-town in the parish, nor any nearer than 
Dingwall, at the distance of about forty-five miles from Ullapool. 
There is a foot-runner, who carries the post letters twice a week 
from Dingwall to Ullapool ; but no turnpike roads, or rail-roads, 
or public carriages, or canals ; and but one village, viz. Ullapool, 
the harbour of which, though small, is in tolerable repair. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situate at the head of 
the Big Loch, at the distance of about thirty-five miles from the 
extremity of the parish, in one direction ; and of twenty-five miles 
from the extremity in another. — It was built in the year 1817, and 
is now, May 1835, undergoing a repair, in consequence of a 
panic which seized the congregation about four years ago, causing 
a rush to be made to the doors and windows, by which many were 
crushed and bruised, though none killed. The alarm was given, 
not from any defect in the church, but by the scream of a person 
seized with epilepsy ; yet such was the effect of the shock on the 
nerves of the people, that many of them could not be prevailed 
upon to enter the church again, unless it should undergo a repair. 
It affords accommodation for 1200 sitters. All the sittings are free. 
The manse was built in 1811, and is now under repair. 
The extent of the glebe is not well ascertained, being connect- 
ed with a piece of ground given by the family of Seaforth to the 
church. The whole consists of an extensive piece of a very steep 
and rugged hill, at the foot of which the present incumbent has 
cleared and brought into culture about a dozen acres at an im- 
mense expense, which they will never repay to him. The rest is 
let to small tenants or crofters, who labour the ground with their 
own hands and feet, by means of a certain implement called the 
cas-chrom, and for which they pay a precarious rent. 

The amount of stipend is 18 chalders, one-half barley, and one- 
half meal; the former, however, being one thirty-second part, and 
the latter, oue-uinth part per boll, less than the county measure; and 



I.OCI-113ROOM. 



87 



the fiars prices being always considerably lower than the ordinary 
retail prices of the county, particularly to a person who cannot af- 
ford to purchase a great quantity at once, tlie living is apparent- 
ly more valuable than it is in fact. 

There is one Government church in the parish, situate in the 
village of Ullapool ; but no chapel of ease nor missionary. And 
it will astonish the reader to hear, that, in this enormous parish, 
there is only one catechist, who receives only the paltry sum of 
L. 7 a-year from the Committee for managing his Majesty's mu- 
nificent Bounty of L. 2000 a-year. 

There is no Seceding, nor Episcopalian, nor Roman Catholic, 
nor dissenting chapel of any denomination, in this parish. All the 
parishioners are of the Established Presbyterian church, and firm- 
ly attached to its doctrines, discipline, and government. The 
church is generally well attended in time of Divine service ; and the 
flumber of communicants in the parish is above 400. 

The writer of this has no distinct recollection of the sums which 
his parishioners may have, on an average of years, collected for re- 
ligious and charitable purposes ; but he is quite sure that they have 
not been behind their neighbours in deeds of charity and benevo- 
lence. 

There are no societies for religious purposes established in the 
parish. In a parish so extensive, so scattered, and so difficult, no 
such societies could meet sufficiently often for any useful purpose. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is 8 ; one 
parochial school, and seven supported by various charitable socie- 
ties. In the parochial school, there are taught, Gaelic and English 
reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, and mathematics. The 
master's salary is L. 34, 4s. Sterling, with the legal accommoda- 
tions. '1 he school fees may amount to about L. 6. He has also 
L. 3, 6s. 8d. as precentor and session-clerk, — all too little for a 
man of liberal education. 

Of the whole population of the parish, only 1496 can read or 
■write in any language, and many of these very imperfectly indeed ; 
while 3710 can neither read nor write ; and it is to be lamented, 
as well as confessed, that many of the people are not sufficiently 
alive to the benefits of education. They make general professions 
of regard to the means of instruction, when destitute of them ; but 
when these means are put within their reach, the sacrifice is small 
indeed, which many will make' to give their children the benefit of 
them. 



88 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 101 ; and the average sum allotted 
to each per year is from 2s. to 5s. The annual amount of con- 
tributions for their relief is about L. 21 ; of which about L. 16, 13s. 
are collected at the church doors, and L. 5 are the interest of 
L. 100 left as a legacy to the poor. There is no other regular 
mode of procuring funds for the poor, except by fines imposed 
upon persons proved guilty of adultery, fornication, &amp;c. ; part of 
which goes to pay the session-clerk and the beadle ; and in the 
most clamant cases of distress, the heritors have always resisted 
an assessment, which cannot be enforced without law expenses. 
There is a strong disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial relief, which they consider as in the lowest de- 
gree degrading. 

There is no prison in the parish ; nor is there any fair held there. 
The number of tippling-houses, particularly about Ullapool, is con- 
siderable ; and their effects on the morals of the people, perni- 
cious. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used is peat, procured from mosses, which 
in many places are nearly exhausted, or so far removed from the 
townships, that, if the labour of providing it could be converted 
into money, at any reasonable rate, it would be much cheaper to 
burn the best of Newcastle coal than the worst of Lochbroom peat. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

The diff"erence betwixt the present state of the parish, and that 
which existed at the time of the last Statistical Account, in regard 
to the implements of husbandry and mode of cultivating the soil, has 
been already noticed. The difference is no less striking, in the 
price of provisions and wages. At present, a boll of oatmeal, of 
the same measure as then, will fetch L. 1, 4s. ; a boll of oats, L. 1 ; 
of barley, L. 1, 10s. Butter fetches from 12s. to L. 1, Is. per 
stone, according to the quality ; and cheese 8s. per stone. A good 
ploughman gets from L. 6 to L. 9 a-year of wages ; a woman from 
L. 1, 5s. to L. 1, 10s. in the half year, with shoes; and a day- 
labourer will hardly think himself well paid by Is. 6d. without 
victuals. 

Improvements.— The first and greatest improvement of any 
country, in a worldly point of view, is, to have it well opened up 
by good roads and bridges. Of this improvement, not one parish 
in Scotland stands nearly so much in need, as the parish of Loch- 
broom. Above forty years ago, a road was constructed at a great 



LOCIIBROOM. 



89 



expense from Dingwall to Ullapool, which, being a new thing in 
the Highlands, astonished the natives not a little. But the line 
chosen was so absurd, and the execution so wretched, that the road 
has been, for many years back, not only useless, but dangerous, to 
foot-passengers and riders on horseback ; and to wheel carriages 
almost impassable, while several of the principal bridges are car- 
ried away, or threatened with being so ; or deserted, from the ori- 
ginal line of road being changed. A new road, therefore, with 
the requisite bridges, of which there has been much talk of late, 
would be an immense improvement, both for the heritors and popu- 
lation of Lochbroom. To talk of manufacturing or agricultural 
improvements to any considerable extent without these, is vain and 
visionary. Even if a hand manufacture, on the smallest scale, 
were introduced, which would enable the females of the parish, by 
any employment suitable to their sex, to purchase Newcastle or 
Liverpool coal for fuel to their families, instead of degrading their 
persons, and often losing their hves, by carrying peats upon their 
backs, from almost exhausted mosses inaccessible to horses or to 
carts, it would be an unspeakable benefit to the country. 

In a moral point of view, the great improvement needed is — 
additional means of religious instruction. On this subject, the 
people at the two extremities of the parish, viz. Coigach, con- 
taining a population of 1975, and Laigh, containing a popula- 
tion of 1187 souls, — have lately presented very strong petitions to 
both Houses of Parliament representing their melancholy state of 
almost total destitution, and imploring the interposition of the 
Legislature in their behalf. And it must be allowed, indeed, by all, 
that in a parish which, if divided into four, with ministers and church- 
es at the most convenient stations, would leave many of the pa- 
rishioners at the distance of ten, twelve, and even fifteen miles, of 
rugged road, from any place of public worship,— there is need of 
Legislative interposition. The voluntary scheme will not suit 
here. 

But, whatever effect these applications may have in procuring 
churches and clerical teachers for the parish of Lochbroom, it can 
never be satisfactorily accounted for, that, out of the large amount 
of Royal and lay Bounty contributed annually for the religious 
and moral improvement of the Highlands, so very small a pro- 
portion should find its way to this enormous parish. The parish. 
It IS true, has been highly favoured with schoolmasters for the in- 
struction of youth by the Gaelic School Society, and by the Gene- 



90 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



ral Assembly Committee, since the latter commenced their labours. 
But of catechists, the description of teachers of all others the best 
calculated to be useful to the grown up inhabitants, many hundreds 
of whom are so involved in ignorance as to be incapable of deriv- 
ing benefit from a continued discourse, the minister, after in- 
numerable applications for many years, has been able to obtam 
only one, of ten that are required ; and for that one he could 
only procure L. 7 of a yearly salary  The gentlemen who have 
the management of the Royal Bounty, and of the funds of the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, may suppose that 
their money is better employed in paying missionaries and school- 
masters than catechists. But I again aver, and without any fear of 
successful contradiction, that, in such parishes as Lochbroom, and 
others in similar circumstances, no teachers, in connection with the 
parish ministers, are so much calculated to be useful as well chosen 
catechists.

I Topography and Natural History. 

Name.—THE name of the parish is compounded of gearr, 
short, and loch. The parish takes its name from a salt water 
loch of the same name. At the end of this loch, the natives point 
out a hollow spot of ground, which they choose to denominate 
« the Gairloch" by way of distinction, as they allege that the 
parish takes its name from it ; but it evidently derives its name 
from the salt water loch, or rather bay, for, comparing it with most 
of the other salt water lochs on the west coast, it scarcely deserves 

the name of Loch. i •, j 

Extent, §-c.— This parish is 40 miles long, and 30 miles broad 
between its extreme points, and contains an area of about 600 
square miles. It is bounded on the south by an arm of the sea 
called Loch Torridon, that runs in betwixt it and the parish of

Applecross ; on the north, by the river Gruinard, that separates 
it from the parish of Lochbroom ; on the east, by a chain of hills, 
where the mountain streams running towards the east and west 
coasts, separate ; and on the west, by the Minch, that separates the 
Long Island, or Lewis, from the main land. To shew the irregu- 
larity of the figure of this parish, it may here be stated, that, on 
the west coast, it has from 80 to 100 miles of sea coast, all of a 
bold rocky description, except on the shores of the inland lochs. 

Hydrography, §-c. — Few parishes on the west coast can boast of 
more magnificent mountain scenery, — as the traveller can testify, 
who has sailed down the picturesque Lochmaree. The principal 
mountain in the range, is Slioch or Sliabhach ; its elevation above 
the level of the sea cannot be less than 3000 feet. The traveller 
who, from the west end of Lochmaree, takes a view of the scenery 
before him, cannot fail to be struck with astonishment at the wild 
grandeur of the scene presented to his view ;— the much -admired 
and far-famed Lochmaree, with its four-and-twenty wooded islands; 
the range of mountains commencing on the right and left, and ex- 
tending four miles beyond the east end of Lochmaree ; Lochmaree 
itself, eighteen miles long, appearing in the distance like an 
amphitheatre of nature's own workmanship, and presenting to the 
eye of the stranger an impenetrable barrier. 

Hydrography.— hochm-eivee, as already stated, is 18 miles long, 
and 11 mile broad at an average. The greater part of it is 60 
fathoms deep, so that it has never been known to freeze, dur- 
ing the most intense frosts. About the centre of the loch, is 
an island called " Island Maree," on which is a burying-ground 
supposed to be dedicated to the Virgin Mary ;— hence the name 

of the island and of the loch. This is one conjecture ; another is, 

that some of the Danish Kings were buried in this island, and that 
the original name of it was « Eilean nan High," which came to be 
pronounced « Eilean Maree." The number of tombstones in the 
burying-place, with inscriptions and hieroglyphical figures which 
few now-a-days can satisfactorily decipher, gives a plausibility to 
this conjecture which is not easily got over. As it is a doubtful 
subject, and likely to remain so, a third conjecture may be ven- 
tured : There lived, a great many years ago, in this part of the 
Highlands, a great and good man called " Maree," who had his 
principal residence on this same island ; after his death his admir- 
ers prefixed Saiit to his name. Many of his generous and bene-

ROSS AND CROMARTY, 



volent deeds are, to this day, recounted by the people of this and 
the surrounding parishes. 

There is only one river worthy of particular notice in this pa- 
rish, viz. the " Ewe" which issues from Lochmaree, and is only 
one mile long from its source to its confluence with the arm of the 
sea, called " Lochewe." This beautiful stream -.abounds with sal- 
mon of the very best description. It is surpassed by no river on the 
west coast for angling; and hence it is, during the summer months, fre- 
quented by gentlemen from all parts of the kingdom, for this healthy 
and dehghtful exercise. An English military gentleman killed one 
hundred salmon and grilse, in the course of a few weeks, during the 
summer of 1834 ; and I am credibly informed that the late proprie- 
tor. Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch, Bart, frequently killed 
twenty salmon in one day. — Besides Gairloch, Lochewe is the only 
other salt water loch in the parish. This loch, into which the waters 
of Lochmaree fall, is from 8 to 10 miles long. Near the mouth 
of it, is a fertile and well cultivated island, called Isle Ewe. Much 
attention and expense were bestowed upon the improvement of this 
island, by the present proprietor. Sir Francis Alexander M'Ken- 
zie of Gairloch, Bart., before he came into the full possession of the 
Gairloch estate. The two principal headlands jutting out on each 
side of Lochewe, are Ru Rea on the south, and Green Stone Point 
on the north side. 

Climate. — The climate is mild, although extremely rainy. This 
may be accounted for, partly by the mountainous character of 
the country, and partly by other causes. The prevailing winds 
are the west and south ; and at whatever season of the year it blows 
from these quarters, we are almost certain of torrents of rain. 
Easterly winds invariably bring us dry weather, and hence they are 
welcome visitants, although they warn us to wear additional cover- 
ings. The easterly winds are more prevalent in the month of 
March and first half of April, than at any other season of the year. 
But there has been a marked change in the climate, for some years 

• On the centre of this island is a deep well, consecrated by the said Saint Marcc 
to the following purpose. To this same well are dragged, volens, uokns, all who are 
insane in this or any of the surrounding parishes, and after they have been made to 
drink of it, these poor victims of superstitious cruelty are towed round the island after 
a boat by their tender-hearted attendants. It is considered a hopeful sign, if the 
well is full at the time of dragging the patient to the scene. In justice to the people 
of this parish, it may be stated, that they have not such an unbounded belief m the 

Llin virtues of the well, and the other parts of the transaction, as their most distant 
nthbours appear to entertain. The belief in sucli absurdities is daily losing ground 

n the I-Iishlands ; and there is little doubt that, in course of a few years more, the 
clouds of superstition that overhang the moral horizon of our Highlands will be dis- 
sipated by the better education of the peasantry.

back. Instead of the deep falls of snow, and the long-continued 
frosts that were wont to starve the black-cattle, smother the sheep, 
and fertilize the soil in former years, we have now mild weather, 
and very much rain. Notwithstanding the extreme wetness of the 
climate, and the people's frequent exposure in the open air, their 
principal employment being fishing, — they are in general healthy, 
and of robust constitutions. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — This, and the neighbouring parish 
of Lochbroom, afford numerous displays of interesting geological 
phenomena. Old red sandstone and quartz rock abound, but 
gneiss and its various subordinate formations may be considered 
the prevailing formation. Upwards of one hundred and fifty years 
ago, when the science of mineralogy was comparatively in its in- 
fancy in Scotland, and when the spirit of speculation and adventure 
did not move with such bold strides as in later times, a Sir James 
Kay sent several people to work at veins of iron ore, on the estate 
of Letterewe, along the north side of Lochmaree, in this parish. 
I understood they continued to work successfully for several years ; 
but as wood was their sole fuel for conducting the operations, they 
were obliged to desist when the wood in the neighbourhood was ex- 
hausted. The ruins of one of the furnaces for working the ore are 
within a few hundred yards of the manse of Poolewe; and those 
of another are ten miles farther up, along the north side of Loch- 
maree. A spot is pointed out to the passer by, near the east end 
of Lochmaree, where they buried their dead. It is, to this day, 
called " Cladh nam Sasganach," the burying-ground of the Eng- 
lishmen. Highlanders look upon all who do not speak the Gaelic 
language as Sasganaich, or Englishmen. At a later period, some 
other individual, or perhaps the same, thought he had discovered 
a vein of silver ore, in another place along the north side of Loch- 
maree; but after digging to a considerable depth, the undertaking 
was abandoned, without yielding a remunerating return to the 
spirited adventurer. 

Botany.— The rarer plants that are found in the parish are the 

Ajuga pyramidalis, Saxifraga stellaria, 

Arbutus alpina, Saxifraga hypnoides, 

Cornus Suecica, Serratula alpina, 

Hicracium alpinum, Thalictrum alpinum, 

Rubus chamaBmorus, Epipactus longifolia. 

aalix herbacea. 

All the culinary plants usually cultivated in Scotland, grow 
freely in this parish, as well as all the common fruits. With re- 
gard to plants used for medicinal purposes, I know only six, viz.

Trees indigenous to this parish, are the 

White barked ash, Fi axinus excelsior. Poplar, - Populus tremula, 

Oak, - - Quercus robur. Bird cherry, - Prunus padus, 

Birch, - - Betula alba, Holly, - Ilex aquifolium. 

Alder, - - Betula ahius. Pine, - Pinus sylvestris, 

Upland willow, Salix alba. Elm, - Ulnus montana. 

Mountain ash, Sorbus alicuparia, 

Of exotic trees for timber, there are none planted excepting 
Larix, Pinus larix — Chestnut, Fagus casfawea,— which thrive ex- 
tremely well. A variety of delicate exotic shrubs bear this cli- 
mate, and produce their flowers, in the grounds of Sir Francis 
M'Kenzie. Trees in general grow rapidly in this moist climate, 
whenever the soil and situation are suitable. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Men. — This parish has been as fortunate as most of 
its neighbours, in being the birth-place and residence of eminent 
characters ; but the only person whom I shall at present mention, 
is William Ross, the celebrated Gaelic bard. This individual 
was born in the parish of Strath, Isle of Skye, in the year 1762. 
After receiving as liberal an education as the school of Forres, at 
that time could aff'ord, he was appointed parochial schoolmaster 
of Gairloch, when about twenty-four years of age. In that situa- 
tion, he continued four years. He died in his twenty-eighth year ; 
and his remains are deposited in the churchyard of Gairloch. 
« As a writer of Gaelic songs," to quote from a short memoir 
prefixed to a Collection of his Songs, published four years ago, 
" William Ross is entitled to the highest praise. In the greater 
number of his lyrics, the bard leads us along with him, and im- 
parts to us so much of his own tenderness, feeling, and enthusiasm, 
that our thoughts expand and kindle with his sentiments. Without 
going beyond the bounds of ■ verity and truth,' it may be affirmed 
that his poetry, more perhaps than that of most writers, deserves 
to be styled the poetry of the heart— of a heart, overflowing with 
noble sentiments, and with sublime and tender passions." 

Land-owners. — The land-owners of the parish are, Sir Francis 
Alexander M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Bart.; Sir George Stewart 
M'Kenzie of Coul, Bart.; Duncan Davison, Esq. of Tulloch ; 
James Alexander Stewart M'Kenzie, Esq. ofSeaforth; and Hec- 
tor M'Kenzie, Esq. of Letterewe.

Parochial Registers. — There were no parochial registers kept in 
the parish previous to the year 1802 ; since that period, they have 
been regularly kept. 

III. — Population. 
Character of the People. — The ancient population of this pa- 
rish, as far back as the oldest living inhabitants can remember, 
was comparatively rude and uncultivated. There are now living in 
the parish, some who remember the time when there was only one, 
or at most two Bibles in the parish, besides the minister's. What, 
in such a state of things, could be expected of the manners of the 
inhabitants  Yet these same individuals will unhesitatingly affirm, 
that people were more generous and more noble-minded at that 
period, than they are now. 

Population in 1801, 1437 
1811, 2755 
1821, 4518 
1831, 4445 

The causes of the increase are various, and too numerous to be 
mentioned here. Among these, however, may be mentioned the 
habit of early marriage, and the system of letting the land in lots. 
The lot of lands this year in the possession of one family may, be- 
fore twelve months are over, be divided into three equal portions, 
— in other words, three distinct families live upon the produce 
of it.

 There are only 4 blind individuals within the bounds of this pa- 
rish : 10 fatuous persons; and 6 deaf and dumb ; 4 of the latter 
belong to one family, and 2 to another. 

Language, -c— The language generally spoken is the Gaelic. 
I am not aware that it has lost ground within the last forty years. 
Some young men, indeed, who have received a smattering of 
education, consider they are doing great service to the Gaelic, 
by interspersing their conversation with EngUsh words, and giv- 



96 



ROSS AND CUOMARTY. 



ing them a Gaehc termination and accent. These corrupters of 
both languages, with more pride than good taste, now and then, in- 
troduce words of bad English or of bad Scotch, which they have 
learned from the Newhaven or Buckie fishermen, whom they meet 
with on the coast of Caithness during the fishing season. The 
Gaelic, however, is still spoken in as great purity by the inhabi- 
tants in general, as it was forty years ago. 

The houses of the people in general, have but one outer door, 
and as they and their cattle go in by that one entrance,— the 
bipeds to take posssession of one end of the house, and the quadru- 
peds of the other, — it cannot be expected that a habitation com- 
mon to man and beast can be particularly clean. Some of the 
people, indeed, are now getting into the way of buildhig byres for 
their cattle, contiguous to their dwelling-houses ; and it is acknow- 
ledged, even by the most indolent, that a great improvement is 
thus effected. It is hoped that the practice may soon become 
more general. When the young people go to kirk or market, few 
appear more " trig or clean ;" and a stranger would hardly be per- 
suaded that some of them lived in such miserable hovels. When 
a girl dresses in her best attire, her very habiliments, in some in- 
stances, would be sufficient to purchase a better dwelhng-house 
than that from which she has just issued. 

The people are in general contented with their situation and 
circumstances. If they have a lot of lands, grass for two or three 
cows, and fishing materials, they seldom have any further objects of 
ambition. Owing to the means of education not being commensu- 
rate with the increase of population, the intellectual character of 
the people does not keep pace with their moral and religious cha- 
racter They are naturally a shrewd, sensible, steady sort of 
people With a few exceptions, they are of good moral character. 
Thev seldom quarrel among each other ; and when they have any 
differences, these are generally settled by the proprietors or factors. 
A law-suit is seldom heard of from this parish. 

When I advert to their religious character, I am constrained to 
acknowledge my fear that their knowledge of the truths of our 
holY religion is more of the head than the heart. The form of 
godliness is not so much wanting as its power. I do not mean, 
however, that in this respect the people of this parish are not on 
a parity with those of the neighbourhood. 

Smiling was carried on to a great extent in this parish, some 
vears a.ro, but is now very much on the decrease; indeed, while 



GAIRLOCH. 97 

there is a vestige of such a demoralizing practice remaining, there 
can be but slender hopes of moral improvement. It may be men- 
tioned to the honour of one of the heritors, that he has erected a 
licensed distillery, for the sole purpose of giving a death-blow to 
smuggling on his estate. 

IV. — Industry. 
Affricultiire.— The number of families employed in agriculture, 
including those who employ servants, is 556; male servants upwards 
of twenty years of age, 86 ; female servants of all ages, 141. 
Number of acres under wood, 5000. I have already mentioned the 
trees indigenous to this parish, and also the exotic trees planted for 
timber. The woods are generally kept in good condition, by thin- 
ning, pruning, &amp;c. 

Bent of Land.— Average rent of arable land is from IDs. to L. 1, 
per acre ; rent of grazing a cow or ox for a year, from L. 1 to 
L. 2 ; rent of pasturing a ewe or sheep for a year, fi-om Is. 6d 
to 2s. 6d. 

Waffes.—Favm-sevyants receive from L. 5 to L. 8 per annum 
for wages, exclusive of their victuals; masons receive from 2s 6d 
to 3s. ; carpenters from 2s. to 2s. 6d. ; blacksmiths, 3s. ; weavers,' 
trom Is. 6d. to 2s. per day, all including victuals. 

Fisheries—The various kinds of fisheries carried on in this pa- 
rish, are salmon- fishing, cod, and ling-fishing, and herring-fish- 
ing. The salmon-fishings are let at L. 1 50 per annum. Salmon- 
fishing IS carried on by cruives, stell-nets, bag-nets, and stake- 
nets. Cod and ling are taken by long lines, and the hand-line- 
and herrmg, by the common mode of meshed nets.- 

Naviffation.~There are four vessels belonging to the several 
ports m the parish, averaging about thirty-five tons burthen each.  
 v.— Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication—This parish is extremely ill sup- 
phed w:th the means of communication, owing to the wanl of roads. 
We have one post-office situated at Poolewe

in the year 1823. The glebe is worth about L. 30 per annum ; 
the amount of the stipend is L. 240. There is one Government 
church in the parish ; it is situated at Poolewe, six miles to the 
north of the parish church, and fourteen from the northern extre- 
mity of the parish. It is now erected into a new and separate pa- 
rish quoad sacra, called the parish of Poolewe. Exactly one- 
half of the population of the whole parish is connected with this 
new parish. We have one catechist employed by the Committee 
for managing his Majesty's Royal Bounty, and another paid by con- 
tributions from the parishioners. There is not a single Dissenter 
within the bounds of the parish. The average number of commu- 
nicants at the parish church and Government church, is 360. 

Education.— The total number of schools in the parish is 9 ; 
the parochial school is one of that number ; all the rest are sup- 
ported by different religious societies. The branches of instruc- 
tion taught at the parochial school are, Greek, Latin, mathematics, 
arithmetic, writing and English, and Gaelic reading. The branch- 
es taught at the Society schools are arithmetic, writing, English and 
Gaehc reading. The 'salary in the parochial school is L. 30 Ster- 
ling and L. 4 are obtained from school fees ; at the Society 
schools, the salaries are from L. 5 to L. 25 Sterhng. Scarcely 
any school fees can be calculated upon, owing to the poverty of the 
people. From six to eight schools are still required in the parish ; 
and some of the schools now in operation ought to be put on a 
more permanent and efficient footing. Not more than one in every 
ten of the whole population is able to read and write in English. 
In 1833, 1773 persons above six years of age could not read either 
in the Gaelic or English languages. 

Poor— The number of poor receiving parochial aid m the pa- 
rish, is about 100, each receiving from 2s. 6d. to 6s. per annum. 
The annual amount for their relief is about L. 16, prmcipally aris- 
ing from church door collections. 

Inns —There are five licensed inns in the parish. Their effects 
are most destructive to the morals of the people. This is evident 
from the fact, that those who live in the close neighbourhood of these 
houses are in general given to tippling and idleness,-whde those 
who have not such a temptation at their doors are sober, industri- 

''"iS-Peat is the only kind of fuel used by the people : it is

expense of from L. 1 to L.2 for a family, in the year.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In concluding this short Account of the parish, I must take 
leave to say, that either the Parliamentary Commissioners for 
Highland roads, or those whose duty it was to make application to 
them, were very remiss in overlooking this parish. When other 
panshes received large grants for conducting public roads through 
their whole length and breadth, this parish, though the public mls 
pass twice through it every- week, from Dingwall to Stornoway 
was completely neglected. It is almost unnecessary to add that' 
without pubhc roads, no regular improvement can be carried on in 
any part of the Highlands. The first great improvement required 
m this way, is a pubhc road fi-om the east end of Lochmaree, along 
I S banks to the harbour of Poolewe,-and throwing an arch across 
the river Ewe, near its confluence with the sea; a spot which 
seems formed by nature for the purpose. The population is by 
much too dense for the means of support which they enioy A 
Government grant to convey one-third or the people to Upper Ca- 
nada would be most desirable ; and, in order to promote the moral 
and religious improvement of the people, two missionaries, and from

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Name. — The modern name Applecross was given to the parish 
by the gentleman who was proprietor of the Comaraich estate, at 
the time of the erection : in commemoration of which event, five 
apple trees had been planted crossways in the proprietor's garden. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish is of great extent, and if reduced to 
a regular form, might be calculated at 20 miles long, and as many 
broad, if not considerably more. The far greater part of the 
parish consists of mountainous rocks and hills, covered with 
heather, and wild grasses. There is nothing remarkable, however, 
in their height or in other respects. 

There are several lakes and rivers which produce trout and sal- 
mon, as Loch Damf, &amp;c., the rivers of Applecross, Torridon, 
Balgie, &amp;c. 

Geology. — The predominating rocks in this parish are red sand- 
stone, quartz rock, and gneiss. 

Soil. — The soil, for the most part, is not rich, deep, loamy, or 
clayey, but rather light, gravelly, and sandy : — it produces, how- 
ever, good crops of oats, barley, and potatoes, &amp;c. There are 
some peat mosses ; but they are not very deep, at least where ac- 
cessible for fuel. In some parts, they are at such a distance from 
the inhabitants, that the making of peats is very expensive, and 
in many cases more expensive than coals. There is plenty of 
limestone at Applecross and Kishorn ; but it is found cheaper to 
buy lime from the kilns at Broadford, in the Isle of Skye, than 
to be at the expense of burning the stones here. There is a cop- 
per mine at Kishorn, which was worked sometime ago, and is said 
to have produced very rich ore. It is to be wished that Mr Mac- 
kenzie of Applecross, the proprietor, would order it to be opened 
again, — as that might considerably benefit his own family, and 
afford employment and support to persons who now lose their time 
in sloth and wretchedness. 

There are several caves and grottoes, said to have been occu- 
pied in old times by banditti and outlaws, or used by the inhabi- 
tants as places in which they preserved their effects from marau- 
ders and plunderers. 

Climate. — The climate is rather moist and foggy, and torrents of 
rain frequently fall in all seasons of the year. For several years 
back, there has been very little snow compared with the storms of 
former times. During the last winter, there was no snow which 
remained so long as a single day on the low grounds. The snow, 
however, covered the hills, and continued in some places till the 



APPLECROSS.

end of April. The climate is not considered as unhealthy, nor 
are the people subject to any distempers but such as are common 
in other parishes on this coast, as fevers, rheumatisms, palsies, 
consumptions, &amp;c. ; and these are not often very prevalent or de- 
structive. 

Zoology, §-c. — There are great herds of deer, and some roes in 
the hills and woods. There are also beasts of prey, as foxes, pole- 
cats, &amp;c. which do considerable mischief among sheep, poultry, 
&amp;c. Of birds there are several kinds, as heath-hens, black-cocks, 
partridges, ptarmigans, wild-pigeons, plovers, snipes, wild-ducks, 
 &amp;c. : also birds of prey, as eagles, kites, hawks, &amp;c. There are 
various kinds of salt water fish, as herring, cod, ling, sythe, cuddy, 
flounder, &amp;c. ; also shell-fish in considerable quantity, as cockle, 
spoutfish, mussels, &amp;c. There are great quantities of the latter 
found in the bay of Applecross, where the sea ebbs a great way, 
and leaves an extensive strand, — the people in great numbers, 
sometimes to the amount of a hundred and more, coming with 
sticks of a particular description, to dig the sand for shell-fish, 
with which they fill large creels in a short time, and which afi'ords 
a wholesome and nourishing food. 

There is a good fir wood at Shieldag, producing timber fit for 
boats, vessels, and buildings, &amp;c. At the mansion-house of Apple- 
cross, there are some young thriving plantations, consisting of ash, 
elm, larch, fir, &amp;c. 

II. — Civil, History. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners are, Thomas Mackenzie, Esq. 
of Applecross; J. A. Stewart Mackenzie, Esq. of Seaforth ; and 
Sir F. A. Mackenzie of Gairloch, Bart. 

Parochial Registers. — There are some registers of baptisms and 
marriages, commencing in the year 1779, but they have not been 
regularly kept. 

Antiquities.— There are a few antiquities, as a small obelisk, 
near the parish church, and some little remains of the Popish re- 
ligious houses ; but they are of no importance. 

Modern Buildings.— There are no modern buildings, except- 
ing the parish church at Applecross, and a Pariiamentary church 
and manse at Shieldag. 

III. — Population. 
In the year 1790, the population was 1734. According to the 
census in 1831, the number was 2892; of whom 1450 were males.

and 1442 females. Baptisms are from 60 to 70 ; and marriages 
from 25 to 30, — on an average of the last few years. 

Language of the People. — The language of the people is gene- 
rally Gaelic, but a great many of them speak English also. The 
people, for the most part, are decent, orderly, and industrious in 
their habits. Cotton cloths are much used by -them. Their or- 
dinary food is potatoes and fish, bread, gruel, pottage, milk, but- 
ter, and cheese, and a little animal food. They, however, complain 
of their circumstances, like the people of neighbouring parishes, — 
which is much owing to the augmentation of rent, which took place 
in the time of the French war, and still remains for the most part 
unreduced. They have suffered, also, by the failure of the herring 
fishing on this coast for several years back, and the low price of 
cattle, — two important sources of their comfort. It is true there is 
a considerable rise in the price of cattle this year ; but it is doubt- 
ful how long that may continue.

Farms in general are of small extent. A few of them pay from 
L. 30 to L. 50 rent. But the generality of the farms consist of 
townships, where the tenants pay from L. 4 or L. 5 to L. 9 or 
L. 10. There are few leases ; ordinary duration, seven years. 
There are not many enclosures, excepting a few near the man- 
sion-house of Applecross. The rental of the jDarish is upwards of 
L. 3000 ; but some of the rents are irregularly and ill paid. Meal, 
grain, and potatoes are often imported, as the produce of the soil 
is not sufficient to support the inhabitants. The manure used for 
the land is compound dunghills, shelly sand, sea-ware, and a little 
lime. There has been much improvement of late in agricultural 
instruments. Iron ploughs are used, two horses to the plough, 
directed by the ploughman without a driver. Formerly four horses 
were used to a plough, with a ploughman and driver, and other 
two persons to keep down the plough in the ground, and level the 



APPLECUOSS. 



103 



rigs. The crooked spade is still used, where there is but little 
pasture for horses, and where the ground is too rough and rocky 
for the plough. Something has been done in the draining and 
improving of land. There are plenty of quarries for building, 
but none regularly worked. 

There is very little commerce, except in small shop-keeping and 
fishing. No manufactures. 

There are about 21 vessels of from eighteen to fifty tons bur- 
den, employed in the fishing and coasting trade. 

There are salmon fishings at Torridon and Balgie, which rent 
at about L. 15 or L. 16. As to the herring-fishing, the tenants 
have all a httle concern in it. 

Wages. — The wages of men-servants, ploughmen, and such, are 
L. 8 a-year, with their maintenance; of women servants, from 
L. 2, 10s. to L. 3 a-year; herd boys get much the same sum; 
labourers charge Is. a-day, and often Is. 6d. ; carpenters, masons, 
and other tradesmen charge generally by the piece. When employ- 
ed at day's wages, wrights and boat-carpenters charge 2s. 6d. ; 
masons, 3s. 6d. Weavers get from 4d. to 8d. per yard. ; tailors 
for a suit of clothes, from 10s. to 15s. ; a great-coat, 5s. ; a cloak, 5s. 

Produce. — Average gross amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Oats and bai-ley may be worth about - L. 3000 0 0 

Potatoes and turnip, about - - 1600 0 0 

Pasturage, black- cattle, and sheep, - 3000 0 0 

Fishings, - - - - - 500 0 0 

L. 8000 0 0 

Deducting L.3000 for rent, price of seed, expense of labour, 
and other incidents, very little will remain for the support of a po- 
pulation of 3000 souls. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — There is no market-town in the parish, nor 
within many miles of it. 

Villages. — There is a fishing village at Shieldag, containing a 
population of 200 souls, with as many more in its environs. 

Means of Communication. — There are good Parliamentary roads 
from Lochcarron to Applecross, and Shieldag. The nearest post- 
office is that of Lochcarron, about twenty miles from Applecross, 
and fifteen from Shieldag. Letter-carriers are employed from both 
these places; a serious expense to the few contributors who furnish 
their salary. There are many bye-roads and footpaths across the 
hills, but they are only fit for foot- travellers. There are many

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



bridges on the Parliamentary roads, and kept in good repair. 
There are good harbours at Poldown, Shieldag, and Torridon. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very ill situated, hav- 
ing very few inhabitants near it, and lying on the north side of a 
river, without a bridge over it, which frequently prevents the people 
from attending public worship. They often, however, wade the 
water, and sit in church during service with wet feet and wet clothes, 
which no doubt occasions many serious complaints among them. 
It were earnestly to be wished, that, by some means or other, whe- 
ther by subscription or otherwise, a bridge was erected on this 
river. A subscription for the purpose has been lately commen- 
ced : it amounts to L. 30, and it is to be hoped, that an equal 
sum may be obtained from kind contributors in other places in- 
terested in the welfare of the people of this place, and the gene- 
ral cause of humanity ; which sum, it is supposed, would be suffi- 
cient to complete the work. The parish church was built in 1817, 
and is in good repair. It is large" enough to accommodate up- 
wards of 600 sitters. There are no seat rents. The manse was 
built in 1796, and has been repaired since. The glebe may be 
worth from L. 12 to L. 14 a-year. The stipend, all paid in mo- 
ney, is L. 158, 6s. 5d. of which Government pays L. 54, 4s. lOd. 
The ministers of the parish since its erection in 1726, have been, 
Mr Angus Macaulay, Mr Colin Macfarquhar, Mr John Macqueen, 
and the present incumbent. The Government church at Shiel- 
dag, which was commenced in 1825 and finished in 1827, is about 
twelve miles from the parish church. It is exceedingly well situat- 
ed for the accommodation of a large congregation ; and it is satis- 
factory to find, that, along with the other Government churches, it 
has been lately erected by the General Assembly into a parochial 
charge. It is also to be hoped, that Govei-nment will soon com- 
plete their own bounty, by raising the stipends of the ministers of 
these churches to the minimum stipends of Scotland. There is 
a catechist supported by the Royal Bounty Committee. There 
are few dissenters, only three or four Episcopalians, and about the 
same number of Baptists. The minister of Shieldag is appointed 
to preach at Kishorn, ten miles distant, once a month, in a place 
of worship built by the inhabitants. The people near the various 
places of worship attend pretty regularly. 

Education.— There are five schools in the parish,— the parochial 
school at Applecross; a school at Shieldag, and another at Torri- 
don, both supported by the General Assembly's Committee ; a 



APPLECROSS. 



105 



school at Kishorn, by the Society for Propagating Christian Know- 
ledge; and a Gaelic school at Badanvougie. The scholars attend- 
ing these schools, may be averaged at 50 each school. English, 
Gaelic, writing, arithmetic, Latin, and mathematics are taught in 
these schools. The parish schoolmaster has a salary of L. 25, and 
L. 2 in lieu of a garden. The fees amount to about L. 8 a-year. 
The salary of each of the teachers at Shieldag and Torridon is 
L. 20, and of the teacher at Kishorn L. 15. The fees may be 
about L. 5 at each of these schools. At Badanvougie, the salary 
 is L. 25, but the teacher has no fees. The parochial teacher has 
the legal accommodations. Several districts are at a great dis- 
tance from all these schools, and wish much for teachers. There 
are six or seven such districts in this parish. Religious know- 
ledge has no doubt been increased of late ; but it is questionable 
if moral improvement has kept pace with that knowledge. Sup- 
posed knowledge puffeth up many, but it unfortunately appears, 
that they are very deficient in that charity which edifieth. There 
are also disputes and hurtful divisions which may, in many cases, 
be ascribed to the conduct of improper teachers employed by some 
well-meaning Societies, both in the metropolis and other places, 
who are unacquainted with the state of the Highlands, and misled 
by the reports of interested persons and busy bodies. And it is a 
matter of much regret, that no small share of these remarks ap- 
phes to the case of superintendants and catechists, under the lu- 
dicrous denomination of local missionaries, though ignorant and 
illiterate, employed by so respectable a body as the Highland Mis- 
sionary Society. 

There is no circulating library in the parish, except those sent 
to the schools at Shieldag and Torridon, by the Assembly's Com- 
mittee. It would be a most desirable measure, if several school 
societies would place their funds under the management of that 
Committee. 

In 1833 it was found there were 1100 persons in the parish 
above six years of age unable to read ; and 500 betwixt six and 
fifteen years of age in the same situation. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.~'T\vQ funds for the poor are very 
small ; but happily the number of persons on the poors' roll is not 
large. About 30 persons receive parochial aid— getting from 5s. 
to 7s. a-year each. The annual amount of contributions for their 
relief is about L. 10 from church collections, and the interest of 
a sum of L. 60 deposited in the bank. Owing to the general po- 



106 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



verty of the Highlanders, and the great distance of the people 
here from the parish cliurch, the Sunday collections rarely amount 
to 2s. and often not to Is. The Shieldag church being more cen- 
trically situated for the attendance of the people, the collections 
are larger. Some small sum is also collected at Kishorn. These 
collections, with the interest of L. 40 for the Applecross district, 
and of L. 20 for the Kishorn district, with fines for delinquencies, 
are the only funds for the poor in this parish. And out of these 
the precentor's salary is paid, and the poor only get a pittance of 
from 5s. to 7s. each in the year. They, however, generally plant 
some potatoes, and get a little fish without expense. The tenants 
also help them from the produce of their farms. There is little 
temptation to be put upon the poor's roll ; and not many of them 
are desirous of it without great necessity. 

Fairs. — There are no fairs in the parish. 

Inns. — There are 4 inns, at Applecross, Kishorn, Shieldag, and 
Torridon. 

Prices of Provisions. — No fixed prices for provisions can be 
stated. Low country meal sells this year at 14s. and 15s. a boll, 
potatoes at 2s. a barrel. There are no butchers to sell meat in 
small quantities ; but, from the prices usually paid for cows and 
sheep, beef and mutton may be had from 2d. to 3d. a pound. 
Hens sell at 6d. a piece, eggs at 2d. per dozen, and sometimes 3d. 

Fuel. — The ordinary fuel is peat, which, in some places, is car- 
ried from a great distance, either by sea or land, and is very ex- 
pensive. When sold, 2d. a creel is paid for it. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The new Parliamentary roads are a great advantage to this pa- 
rish. A bridge on the river of Applecross would be a most im- 
portant improvement, not only for the benefit of the inhabitants, 
but also of travellers from various quarters. And it is to be hop- 
ed, that, through friendly assistance, this most desirable measure 
will soon be accomplished. Additional schoolmasters and cate- 
chists would be a great advantage. Agricultural improvements 
might be carried on to a considerable extent. Manufactures can- 
not be easily introduced, nor is it likely they would answer. There 
are too many of them in other places already. The improvement 
of the soil is what chiefly demands attention.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHCARRON, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. JOHN MACKENZIE, MINISTER. 



• — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Lochcarron is so called from an arm of the sea of 
the same name by which it is intersected, and which derives its 
name from the river Carron signifying in Gaelic a winding stream 
which falls into it. 

Extent, c— It is 25 miles long. To its breadth it is difficult 
to apply any scale of measurement. From its eastern extremity 
to the end of the loch about 15 miles it is upwards of 10 miles 
broad. It is then considerably narrowed. On the south side, the 
parish extends along the loch for about 4 miles. On the north, it 
consists of an elevated ridge, extending along the coast for nearly 
ten miles, and seldom exceeding 2 miles in breadth. Including 
Courthill, situated in Kishorn, within the parish of Applecross, 
Lochcarron may contain 250 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The entrance to the parish from 
the east is a glen, bounded by hills varying in height, and stretch- 
mg out into heathy and uncultivated moors. As you pass along, 
the scene becomes more interesting. The bottom of the valley is 
watered by the Carron, which, by the accession of several tributary 
brooks, is increased to a considerable stream. The banks are di- 
versified with portions of cultivated ground ; and the hills on both 
sides present pasture of a superior description. 

Not far distant, along the base of a hill facing the north, rising 
almost perpendicularly, covered with natural woods of birch, alder, 
and wild ash, you see Lochdowal in the Carron adorned with three 
islands, skirted with ash, oak, and underwood ; and farther on, you 
have Lochcarron, which presents the appearance of a fresh water 
lake. The glen widens as you approach the loch, and opens 
into a valley equal in extent to any on the coast, and furnishes a 
fine subject for improvement. The most interesting view of the

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



parish is from an eminence in Lochalsh above Strome Ferry. 
From this eminence, looking to the north-east, you behold the 
fine expanse of Lochcarron, presenting the appearance of a fresh 
water lake about 20 miles in circumference, embosomed in hills, 
which at the head of the loch rise to a considerable height. The 
hills surrounding the valley appear almost to meet in their bases, 
and to jut towards the loch like so many promontories. 

The sloping ground of Strome, extending from the ferry, pre- 
sents a seines of gentle and irregular hillocks, diversified with na- 
tural birch, ash, and underwood, — while cultivated fields frequently 
relieve the eye ; and behind this ridge, the mountains of Apple- 
cross tower aloft, in rugged and precipitous magnificence. 
. In a calm summer evening, when hundreds of boats are seen 
shooting their nets, and scores of vessels lying at anchor, Loch- 
carron exhibits a scene of rural felicity and of rural beauty that is 
seldom to be witnessed. 

Soil, c. — The parish presents every variety of soil. The pre- 
vailing winds are north-east and south-west. The climate, in the 
opinion of the older inhabitants, has undergone a considerable 
change. They allege that the winter has become less severe, the 
summer less mild. The climate is so variable as to render an ac- 
curate description of it impossible. The winter is generally mild, 
and during its continuance vegetation is seldom checked. The 
spring is usually wet, and such as greatly retards the operations of 
the farmer. Early in this season, we have occasionally storms of 
hail, brought by a north-west wind. In April and May, we have 
keen easterly winds, with frost at night, which proves very injuri- 
ous to such fruit trees as are then in blossom. We have not the ge- 
nial warmth of summer until the beginning of June. The crops 
then make rapid progress; nature is clothed in the beauty of sum- 
mer ; and when free from rain the weather is most delightful. The 
weather in harvest is very changeable, and renders the securing of 
the crop very troublesome and expensive. Speaking in general, 
this parish, hke the rest of the west coast, is very subject to rain, 
from the height of the mountains and their proximity to the At- 
lantic. The prevalent distempers are such as arise from damp 
and sudden vicissitudes of weather ; such as fevers, colds, and rheu- 
matism. Cutaneous and scrofulous disorders are likewise common, 
occasioned, probably, by poor feeding and inattention to cleanhness. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Our mountains are principally com- 
posed of gneiss, with smaller displays of quartz rock and red sand- 



LOCHCARRON. 



109 



stone. The same gneiss rocks and clay generally meet us on the 
plain. In the heights of the country, limestone is found in beds 
in the gneiss, and is wrought for agricultural purposes by the te- 
nantry in the neighbourhood. In Kishorn, limestone is abundant. 

Hydrography. — A few chalybeate springs are scattered over dif- 
ferent parts of the country, but they are not of such a nature as to 
indicate the existence of extensive strata of iron. 

Zoology. — The animals which inhabit the parish are, deer, roe, 
fox, polecat, and weasel. Game, moorfowl, partridge, plover, 
and ptarmigan. In our lakes, wild-duck abound, singing-birds, 
thrush, lark, linnet, blackbird, and redbreast ; water-birds, gulls, 
they have their nests in islands in our mountain lakes duck, scart, 
curlew, sea-lark, and oyster-eater. The black eagle builds in 
some of the most inaccessible rocks ; but as great pains have been 
taken to destroy the species, it is now rare. The kite has his ey- 
rie. Of migratory birds, swans visit us occasionally in winter, wag- 
tail in February, swallow in April, and cuckoo about the same 
time. 

In the river Carron, salmon are found early in the season ; but 
they are most numerous in June, July, and August; during which 
months, sea trout also come up in considerable numbers. Forty 
years ago, a common fisher could easily take with the rod twenty 
salmon in a day ; at present, the most experienced angler will be 
contented with one good fish. Several species of fishes are taken 
in the Frith, but herring may be said to be the only species of im- 
portance in an economical point of view. The herring fishing has 
been unsuccessful for the last ten years : and may now be consi- 
dered rather a losing concern, inasmuch as the profits of the few 
favourable seasons can hardly counterbalance the outlays of these 
and other seasons, during which a supply for home consumption 
is the utmost that can be secured. 

11. — Civil History, 
 Impenetrable darkness rests on the history of this district till 
within a late period. It was for many ages the scene of the 
barbarous depredations of contending clans, who, as the use of 
letters was little known among them, left no other memorial of 
their transactions than the dubious records of traditional poetry. 
At an early period, the parish was in the possession of several 
chiefs,— the principal of whom was Macdonald of Glengarry, who 
had the western part at Strome. All these were gradually dispos- 



110 



ROSS ANt CROMARTY. 



sessed by SeaCorth Lord Kintaii, who took the Castle of Strome 
in 1G09, as recorded in the last Statistical Account. 

Not ftirther back than the middle of last century, the inhabitants 
of this district were involved in the most dissolute barbarity. There- 
cords of presbytery, which commence in 1724, are stained with an 
account of black and bloody crimes, exhibiting a picture of wildness, 
ferocity, and gross indulgence, consistent only with a state of sava- 
gism. The people, under the influence of no religion, but, from 
political considerations, attached to Episcopacy, conceived a rooted 
dislike to the Presbyterian system, which all the prudence of the 
clergy was for some time unable to eradicate. In March 1725, 
we find the presbytery of Gairloch now presbytery of Lochcarron 
obliged to hold a meeting at Kilraorack ; as the presbytery, to 
use the language of the record, had no access to meet in their own 
bounds, since they had been rabbled at Lochalsh on 16th September 
1724, that being the day appointed for a parochial visitation there. 
From a petition which Mr Sage the first Presbyterian minister of 
Lochcarron, settled in 1726, presents to the presbytery in 1731, 
praying for an act of transportability, — we see that he considered 
his life often in danger ; that only one family attended regularly on 
his ministry ; and that he despaired of being of any service in the 
place. Mr Sage laboured in the place for forty-seven years. By 
his prudent conduct, he gradually conciliated the affections of the 
people, and mitigated the rancour of their prejudices, and was in- 
strumental in bringing them to a state of comparative civilization. 

Eminent Men. — About the time that Mr Sage was settled in 
the parish, flourished William and Alexander Mackenzie, brothers, 
the authors of some popular Gaelic poems. Such of the effusions 
of Wilham as have escaped the ravages of time exhibit the dijecta 
membra poetae, and serve to excite our regret that so much has 
been lost. His elegy on his brother's death, in tenderness of sen- 
timent and felicity of expression, will not shrink from a compari- 
son with some of the most successful efforts of the cultivated muse. 

Antiquities. — We have no monuments of antiquity to interest 
the antiquarian. The ruins of Strome Castle still remain ; and 
on the rising ground behind Janetown, and at Langanduin in Kis- 
horn, we have one of those circular buildings or duin so frequent 
on the west coast. 

IIL — Population. 
The increase of population may be principally attributed to the 
division of land into lots. The village of Janetown, which at no

distant period consisted of only three families, contains now a po- 
pulation of nearly 500.

1819. The register kept before that time was accidentally burnt.

Number of children in each family, 5 or perhaps 6 on an ave- 
rage. Insane, 3 ; fatuous, 4 ; blind, 4 ; deaf and dumb, 4. 
Land-owners. — Landed proprietors two. 

Language of the People. — The language generally spoken is 
Gaelic ; but English is spoken by a great proportion of the 
younger people. Gaelic cannot be said to have lost ground for 
the last forty years ; but it has been much corrupted by our fre- 
quent intercourse with the south, and the silly vanity of persons, 
who wish it to be understood, that they know something of another 
language.  

Habits, Sic. of the People. — The ordinary food of the pea- 
santry is potatoes and herring twice a-day, and oatmeal gruel for 
supper. Those in better circumstances have, besides, oat cake, 
butter and cheese, and in winter and spring use for dinner, broth 
and mutton as a substitute for herring. Of the houses, some are 
of turf, but the greater part of stone frequently built with lime. 
The roof is covered over with turf, — above which, there is a coat 
of heather or ferns. There is seldom a chimney to the houses. 
The fire is kindled alongside of the wall, or a stone in the cen- 
tre of the room, and the smoke reeks its way out at the roof, or" 
door, or windows. The windows generally consist of wooden shutters, 
made to open at pleasure and admit the fresh air. The floors are 
of clay and mud. In many houses, the cattle are under the same 
roof, and even enter at the same door with the family, and are only 
separated from them by a partition of boards, wattles, or stone, 
having a door in the middle. As will be readily imagined, the 
space between this partition and the outer door is sometimes so 
dirty, that it is difficult for him who enters to pick out a clean foot- 
ing. The greater part of the people do certainly not enjoy the 
comforts of society, and they are far from being satisfied with their 
situation and circumstances. Those living on the coast, particu-

larly depending for their subsistence upon the herring fishing, a 
fluctuating and precarious employment, are frequently in a very 
poor condition. But they have their lands cheaper, and are on 
the whole in better circumstances than the peasantry of the 
neighbouring parishes. The people are industrious and oblig- 
ing. They are naturally acute, and such as have had the advan- 
tages of education are intelligent. With respect to religion, there 
is a considerable excitement, and a considerable profession. From 
the practice introduced by the late minister, of causing the people 
to deliver their sentiments on religion publicly at fellowship meet- 
ings, many show a wonderful facility in talking upon such subjects ; 
but close observation enables us to perceive that their knowledge 
is merely superficial. To the peculiar phrases used by them, they 
are found to attach no definite ideas ; and if the ideas which the 
phrases convey are expressed in another language, the words of 
which they understand, they do not recognize them. What is 
most to be blamed, is a general addiction to flattery and infidelity 
to engagements.

descriptions visit us. We have a post-office in Janetown, where 

the mails arrive three times a-week.

Ecclesiastical State. — The church was built in 1751. It is si- 
tuated in the centre of the parish, and as the roads are good, it is 
pretty convenient for the greater part of the population. It affords 
accommodation for upwards of 300, but is a miserable edifice, al- 
most unfit for the exercise of public worship. 

The glebe contains 10 arable acres, and pasture for 6 cows and 
150 sheep. The stipend is the minimum. There is no Episco- 
palian in the parish, and only one Roman Catholic, a woman. The 
inhabitants are partial to the Establishment; but are far from 
being punctual in their attendance on public worship. A cate- 
chist labours among them, paid by the session. There are no 
Dissenting or Seceding families in the parish. 

Education. — In the parochial school, are taught, Greek, Latin, 
and all the ordinary branches of education. The salary is the 
maximum, and the amount of school fees may be about L. ] 5. Tire 
expense of education is from 8s. to 18s. per annum, according to 
the branches studied. At present, there is no Society school 
in the parish; children come therefore to the parish school, from 
a distance of six miles. Three additional schools are required, and 
they would secure an attendance of from 30 to 70 scholars. There 
are at present from six to fifteen years of age, 291, and upwards 
of fifteen, 693 persons who cannot read. The people are in general 
alive to the benefits of education. They are particularly anxious 
that a knowledge of English should be imparted to their children, 
from an impression that their temporal interests will be more cer- 
tainly promoted by a famiharity with that language. 

Poor.— The number of poor receiving aid from the parochial 
funds is from 25 to 30. The sum allotted to each is small. Our 
church collections do not amount to L. 8 per annum, and there is 
no other mode of procuring funds besides the fines imposed on de- 
linquents. 

Fairs.— The only fair held in the parish is the new Kelso mar- 
ket, on the first Monday of June. At one time, it was a consi- 
derable fair for cattle, but now it has dwindled into an annual term 
for settling accounts and drinking whisky. 

Inns.— There are 2 inns in the parish, and 2 dram-houses. The 
resort of the younger part of the people to these places tends 
much to corrupt their morals. 

i'weZ.— The fuel used is dried moss, procured at no other ex- 
pense than the labour of lifting it.

Miscellaneous Obsehvations. 
Since the last Account was drawn up, considerable improve- 
ments have taken place in agriculture, persons of skill and capital 
have introduced an approved system of husbandry, and their example 
has been speedily followed by the tenantry. To promote the com- 
fort of the people, it would-be necessary to give longer leases, so 
as to encourage a spirit of improvement, and to let the lands at a 
cheaper rate, that the produce might pay the rents without any 
other resource, which is now far from being the case, and to af- 
ford employment to the labouring classes, by introducing judicious 
improvements at the expense of the proprietors. In diffusing 
among them the blessings of knowledge, much might be done by 
the introduction of a more efficient system of education, by the 
establishment of parochial libraries, and the circulation of cheap 
periodicals. 

P. S. Since the above Account was written, the church has been 
condemned by the presbytery ; and it is confidently expected, that 
the heritors of Lochcarron will erect the house of worship, to be 
built in its stead, in a style worthy of the object and the situation. 

The rental may be stated at not less than L.2500. 

At the death of the late incumbent the author of the last 
Statistical Account, the glebe of Lochcarron scarcely contained 
5 acres of arable land, properly so called; 5 acres more are now 
in good heart ; and 10 acres are in progress of cultivation. The 
whole extent of the glebe, from the loch to the top of the hill 
may, at a rough guess, be said to be two miles in length, by half 
a mile in breadth ; a goodly pasturage, without doubt, were its 
nature equal to its extent.

THE REV. JOHN CAMERON, MINISTER. 



t 

I.— TOPOGRAPIHY AND NatURAL HlSTORY 

ajne.—THE parish of Stornoway is situated in the island of 
Lewis, and derives its name from the point of land on which the 
town of Stornoway is situated. Stron, in the language of the coun- 
try, signifies a nose, Strdn-a hhaigh, the nose of the bay It 
appears that the ancient orthography of the word was Stronoway, 
from which, by the transposition of the letter r, comes the modern 
name of the town and parish. In Dean Monroe's account of Lewis 
the name of the bay is written Steornoway ; and in Martin's history 
of the Western Isles, it is called Sternbay and Stornbay 

In the former Statistical Account, the ancient name of the pa- 
rish IS said to have been Uy, which in the Danish language siJni. 
fies an isthmus or neck of land. Certain it is, that the only pface 
of worship in the parish was built on an isthmus. But, from time 
out of memory, the parish consisted of three districts, viz. Storno- 
way Gross, and Ui. In each district, there was a place of worship 
erected ; and the ruined walls of two chapels are still remaining, one 
at Ui, the other at Gress. It was only within the last forty years 
that the ancient place of worship in Stornoway was levelled, for the 
purpose of building a safer and more commodious church for the 
increasing population. 

Tlie church of Stornoway was dedicated to St Lennan, that of 

of T Ji I '"r I" the district 

of Ui the ruins of another chapel are visible; it was dedicated to 

w thinTh „hf.\hurches were sanctuaries in ancient times. 

Account  safe.-Ffrf. Martin's 

nnff P"''h ■''" the '-ter of Creid to 
north lolsta, is fully 16 miles; its breadth from Tuimpan head, 



116 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



including the broad bay to the top of Mournack hill, is 10 miles ; 
giving at least 160 square miles of land and water. 

Boundaries. — It is bounded by the parish of Barvas and the dis- 
trict of Ness, on the north ; on the east and north-east, by the chan- 
nel between Lewis and the mainland called the Minch ; and by 
the parishes of Lochs and Uig, on the south and west. 

The figure of the parish is irregular ; it has some similarity to 
an inverted Italian i, the straight line extending from the Creid 
to Tolsta, the bent limb from Tuimpan-head round Chicken-head 
to the castle. 

There is only one hill of any note in this parish ; its name is 
Mournack, or Mounac. It lies between Barvas and Stornoway. 
Though the coast is bold and rocky in some parts, in general there is 
a gentle acclivity ; the ascent is rarely abrupt. This hill is the first 
land visible to those who cross the Minch to Stornoway from the 
mainland ; its elevation above the level of the sea does not exceed 
700 feet ; it is of a spheroidal shape ; its range is north-east and 
south-west. 

Caves, §-c. — There are several caves and fissures on the coast ; 
but three are particularly worthy of notice. One at Garra-ghu- 
ism on the farm of Coll, has two chambers with vaulted roofs, and 
a finely sanded floor. The sides of the chambers are beautifully and 
closely studded with small mussels, which reflect a variety of co- 
lours, in a clear day, to the eye of the observer. The entrance is 8 
feet high, by 14 feet broad or wide ; depth and length within, 15 
by 30 feet ; it is accessible only at spring tides. 

There are two caves about the distance of an English mile from 
Gross House, both of which are spacious ; but the Seal cave is the 
most remarkable in the island. It is about a furlong in length from 
the entrance to high water-mark in the interior. Its height and 
breadth are variable. The cave at the mouth, is about ten feet wide : 
it gradually decreases to four feet in breadth ; and after this, it wid- 
ens and terminates in a spacious semicircle, irregularly arched, and 
containing a deep bason of water. Here, the roof is very lofty, and 
resplendent when viewed by torch-light. Beyond the margin of the 
basin, is a sandy and gravelly beach, very pleasant and acceptable 
after such a dark navigation. There is a small apartment in the 
interior, which by torch-light produces a fine effect ; the pearly ici- 
cles of satalactite suspended from the roof, reflect the light as from so 
many diamonds. The sides and roof of the cave are lined with this 

concreted matter. The natives, and strangers who have visited 

1 



LEWIS STORNOWAY. II7 

the cave, broke and carried away many of the finest icicles; but with 
a short respite, the plastic power of nature can restore the iniury 
d one by man. 

This cave had been the rendezvous of the seals which frequent- 
ed the Broad bay for ages; great shoals of which were seen about 
the entrance, by fishermen and herdsmen from the tops of the rocks. 
Curiosity, and the hope of securing the seals, induced some of the 
people to enter, armed with iron shod clubs and torches. By guarding 
the entrance as much as possible, the work of destruction commen- 
ced within, and vast numbers of these animals were killed. For se- 
veral years, there was, about the Michaelmas term, an annual visit 
oi the seals to the cave ; but finding their retreat discovered, and 
themselves so much disturbed, they now seldom enter the spacious 
hall of their ancestors. 

Through the kind attentions of Lewis M'lver, Esq., tacksman 
01 Cxress, several strangers had an opportunity of visiting this won- 
derful cave. Its celebrity is increasing : and it is supposed to be 
only second to the spar cave in Skye. The icicles and crustation 
are similar ; the mouths of the caverns front each other, though 
distant eighty miles.  
Coast, 4-c.— The sea-coast is much indented. It is bold and rocky 
n many places; and should aperson walk along the shore, the beach- 
es, and headlands, he would at least travel the extent of fifty miles 
in the parish. The shore, where the beach is flat, consists of 
beautiful sand, as the sands of Tong, Melbost, Ui, Coll, Gross, 
and lolsta. Blue and red clay are found on some parts of the 
coast Of the red clay, the indigenous islanders make vessels cal- 
led Craggans, ,n which they keep their milk and carry water from 
the springs. Where the coast is bold and rugged, it consists of 
shelving rocks, which form an angle of small inclination, as in the 
bight of Shelwick below Gress: in other parts of the coast, they 
he in an horizontal position. Kneess is a bold lofty perpendicular 
wall of puddingstone, many fathoms in height. 

Bays -The principal bays are Broad bay. Loch or bay of Stor- 
noway. Loch Ure Bayble and Tolstabay. The Broad bay is not safe 
tor stranger vessels, as there is a sunken reef branching from Gress 
to the Aird of Tong, and Isthmus of Ui : but vessels belonging to the 
island, and others, once acquainted with the mooring stations, are 
olten sheltered here from the south and south-east winds. By moon- 
light, strangers are often deceived when going to the southward, 
he isthmus of Ui lies low, and is not 200 yards broad in some parts. 



1 18 ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

« 

The water in Loch Ui seems to be one continued sheet with the 
Broad bay. Several vessels have been wrecked in consequence of 
this illusion,— supposing they were sailing all the while between the 
Schante islands and the Harris land. 

The loch or bay of Stornoway is a safe harbour; two hundred 
vessels of any burden can safely anchor in it. The ground is good, 
and no heavy sea can injure vessels. The hills and town, which sur- 
round the harbour, shelter them from the west and north ; the 
Point of Arnish and Island Gowell, form a breakwater and shel- 
ter, on the south. 

The headlands are five, Tolsta head, Kneess near Gress, Tu- 
irapan -head, Chicken-head, and Holm-point. There are no islands 
of any size on the coast, in the parish ; but there are two small ones 
at Holm and Island Gowell, at the mouth of the harbour of Stor- 
noway. 

Meteorology. — The temperature of the atmosphere is variable, 
the climate very rainy, — and the air extremely moist, insomuch that 
when a person walks by the sea side, in a hazy atmosphere and un- 
der a cloudy sky, the saline particles rest like dew on the pile of his 
coat. The dampness of the air is such, that in rooms wherein fires 
are not constantly kept, the walls emit a hoary down of a brinish 
taste, resembling pounded saltpetre, when brushed off. The cH- 
mate is an enemy to polished iron and to books. Fire-irons rust in 
the space of twenty-four hours without constant fire; and books are 
covered with a greyish-yellow mould, unless frequently wiped. 
Frequent and heavy rains fall at all seasons, especially after the 
Lammas term, whereby the hopes of the husbandman are often blast- 
ed, and the fruit of his toil and industry in a great measure lost. 
But such a climate may be naturally expected in an island lying so 
far north, in latitude 58°, and surrounded by the Atlantic on the 
west and south ; and by the Pentland Frith on the north-east. And 
though there are few high hills on the north-east part of the island, 
to break or attract the clouds, still the extensive and deep tract of 
moss, many miles in length and breadth, with the combined in- 
fluence of a hundred fresh-water lakes, continually emitting exha- 
lations, attract the passing clouds as effectually as lofty mountains 

do in other places. 

The drapery of the morning and evening clouds is strikuigly 
rich and grand. The luminous meteors are uncommonly splen- 
did. The halo around the moon is sometimes of a very large 
diameter, and is almost weekly visible, during the winter. The Au-

rora Boi-ealis in brilliancy far surpasses any appearance of the 
kind seen on the mainland. 

The prevailing winds are the south-west and the west. They 
invariably bring torrents of rain, if continuing forty-eight hours 
from these points. The north and north-east winds are cold and 
dry, in the end of spring and beginning of summer; at the latter 
season they prevail for a month or six weeks ; and if from the north- 
east the gardens are infested with caterpillars. 

Diseases.— There is one peculiar distemper prevalent in this 
island, which seizes infants about the fifth night after their birth, and 
carries them off in convulsive fits. Alexander M'lver, Esq. surgeon, 
has favoured me with the following statement : " The climate of 
Lewis is chiefly remarkable for its extreme humidity, and for the 
change which, within the last twenty years, has taken place in it, in 
regard to mddness. Even in winter, excessive cold is now unknown,— 
It bemg a rare occurrence for snow to remain three successive days 
on the ground, although formerly this season was very frequently ri- 
gorous. The proximity of the western ocean, the mossy nature of the 
sod, and the almost invariable flatness of the surface, combine to im- 
press these characters on the climate of this island. The diseases 
to which the inhabitants are most liable, are those which proceed 
from exposure to dampness and cold, as inflammatory diseases ; and 
those which are produced by the continued use of vegetable diet 
such as dyspepsia and dropsy. These distempers, the unceasing 
hardships and toil to which the people are subjected from their 
youth, and the want of that vigour which nutritious food gives to the 
frame, being inimical to longevity, the lower classes, but more par- 
ticularly the male portion of them, may be said to die, in general, 
at an early age. The disease incident to infants, which is vulgarly 
called by the name of ' the fifth night's sickness,' is the Trismus 
mfantum or infant lock-jaw. It appears most frequently in moun- 
tainous districts, and seldom admits of cure." 

Hl/dyraph-Friths.-No Friths intersect the parish, but the 
Broad-bay, which, at the entrance between Tuimpan-head and 
Kneess, is four miles broad,- It runs inland about ten miles ; and 
at spring tides, its water reaches within half a-mile of Stornoway to 
he north of Bay -head. Its colour is a dark green with a bluish 
tinge ; its depth varies from four to twenty fathoms. Luminous 
globues appear on the surface when agitated; the fishermen's oars 
at night seem of a golden brilliancy; and a flaming stream rushes 
I'-om the, helm of the vessel or boat. In shallow water on the 



120 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



sainds of Toiig, by the motion of my horse's feet, beautiful- golden 
stars, of the size of half a-crown, are made to float on the surface, 
for a few seconds ; these disappear, and are succeeded by others, 
often to the terror of the animal. It is probable these appearances 
arise from the decaying particles of fish which float on the surface ; 
and when the water is troubled, the air escaping forms a globule, 
which emits a phosphorescent light before it bursts. The brine 
must be strong, for the water left in shallow basins on the rocks is 
converted into salt, when the summer heat is strong. The cur- 
rent in the Broad-bay flows south and ebbs north, — though in the 
Minch the flood is to the north, and the ebb to the south. 

Springs. — There are perennial springs in the parish, the water 
of which is most excellent ; but many of the natives, rather than 
be at the trouble of digging for wells, drink mossy and surface wa- 
ter. Martin relates, that the well St Cowstans in Garrabost never 
boils any kind of meat, however long subjected to the fire ; and 
this holds true, I presume, of every water, when the fuel is wet and 
the fire of insufficient strength. 

Lakes. — Lakes or lochs are numerous, and cover many acres ; 
but the largest does not exceed three miles in circumference ; the 
greatest depth, two fathoms. The scenery isbleak and dreary. Wa- 
ter occupies 204 acres. 

There are six streams of considerable size in the parish, viz. 
the Creid, Laxdale, Tong, Upper and Nether Coll rivers, and the 
Gress. The course of the longest, from its source to the sea, is 
about ten miles. The Creid and Gress are the largest and most 
rapid. The velocity of these is seven miles an hour ; breadth 30 
feet ; depth 4 feet at low water. The tide enters all these. The 
Creid joins the sea in Loch Stornoway. Laxdale, Coll, Tong, and 
Gress, discharge their waters into the Broad bay. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The island of Lewis was not inap- 
propriately compared to a gold laced hat in the former Statistical 
Account; for the cultivated parts of the coast bear the same pro- 
portion, as yet, to the bleak moss in the interior, as the gold lace 
on the rim of the hat, to the whole superficies of the chapeau. 
There is abundance of sand on the sea-shore ; some clay, and a 
little lime at Garrabost. There is also a great appearance of bog- 
iron, if we may judge from numerous chalybeate springs. 

Tiiere is a large whinstoue dike witli parallel walls, on the farm 
of Gress. It is supposed to run across the island, as a similar 
dike is seen at the Butt of Lewis on the north, and at Garrabost 
in a southerly direction. 



LEWIS STORNOWAY. 121 

The peat is the best in the world, hard and black ; when tho- 
roughly dried, it gives light and heat equal to those of coals. 

Soils.~The soil is of different kinds, some sandy, gravelly, or of 
black earth,— but the greater part mossy,— all lying on a hard red 
clay bottom, so very impenetrable, that the pick will scarce pierce 
It. Moss, red clay, and sand, especially shelly sand, when pro- 
perly mixed, drained, and well manured, make good soil, and give 
a fair crop. But the wet winters and springs take the pith out of 
the soil. The rain is not absorbed rapidly by the red clay tilly 
bottom ; and when the field is a flat level, it is quite inundated; and 
where it slopes, the soil is gradually washed away from the top of 
the field to the bottom. 

The plants most frequently found in the arable ground are, the 
sorrel, Rumex acetosella, sealbhag, thistle, carduus, cluaran, chick- 
weed mouse-ear, cerastium, horse-tail, equisetum, and wincopipe. 

The island of Lewis is a full century behind other parts of Scot- 
land, in agricultural and domestic improvements, the town and in- 
habitants of Stornoway excepted, and a few tacksmen. With re- 
spect to agricultural improvement, it is the most backward of all 
the Hebrides. A great deal has been done, during the last twelve 
years, by consuming the moss, draining and trenching; and if these 
operations be continued with vigour, very great improvement may 
be expected. 

Zoo.v.— Many animals common in other places are unknown 
in this parish, viz. frogs, toads, foxes, and partridges. One froff 
was thrown, last summer, on the quay from the hold of a ship 
which brought potatoes from the mainland, and curiosity brought 
many to see the reptile stranger. Serpents, two feet long and 
one mch diameter, are frequently met with by herds, in the moor. 
I hey sting or bite the cattle, by which they swell, and sometimes 
die. The usual cure for this swelling, is water in which the 
preserved head of a serpent has been put, and which is given to 
the animal affected, and its whole body washed with it. When 
serpents are killed, their heads are chopped off and preserved for 
this purpose. 

p ete here. The six orders are found: Accipitres, or the falcon-kind; 
1 cae, sea-pies ; Anseres, Grails, Galling, and Passeres. Eagles, 
lalcons, and hawks are numerous; the raven and grey carrion crow 
are destructive to lambs and weat sheep. I lately saw two ravens 
rest on a sheep's back while the animal was feeding, pierce a

hole above the hind liaiinch, and pull out the intestines before it 
fell. The wild goose, rain-goose, swan, teal-duck, common wild 
duck and drake, wigeon, sheldrake, puffins, guillemots, solan goose, 
plover, wild pigeons, and grouse in abundance are found here. 
A few robins, numerous larks, thrushes and starlings. The cuckoo 
visits us, but makes a very short stay. The sand-martin is the 
only one of the swallow tribe that visits the island ; the songsters 
of the grove are few. The common house-sparrow, Fringilla do- 
mestica, has only of late visited the island. There are two pair just 
now in Stornoway, hatching. The gardens miss them very much, 
for the caterpillar, which has been unknown in this parish twenty 
years ago, is now a great plague. If this small bird could thrive 
in Stornoway, it would be a considerable boon, for it has been 
found, by actual observation, that two sparrows carried to their 
nest forty caterpillars, in an hour. The late Lord Seaforth im- 
ported partridges, but they are now extinct. Whether they were 
killed, died, or did not like the climate, is uncertain. The hares 
which were brought along with them, are very numerous. 

The black-cattle, horses, and sheep, are rather of a diminutive 
size. They are too numerous by one-half ; a small tenant that pays 
annually L. 3 Sterling, keeps seven or eight beasts. One farm 
yields L. 40 of rent. It is occupied by ten families, who have eighty 
head of cattle, miserable starved beasts. In winter, they can gather 
very little pasture on the moor ; and during snow, they are driven 
to the shore to feed on ware, Alga marina. It is a mistaken kind- 
ness in the proprietor to permit the small tenants to keep so many 
beasts, — for one would be better than two ; it would be better fed, 
and bring more cash at the tryst. The farmers or tacksmen keep a 
larger breed of horses for riding and for the cart; but, in general, 
the horses are not much higher than the Shetland ponies. They 
are firm and strong, fit for the mossy soil and rocky shore. Their 
principal work is in carrying peats and sea-ware in creels, one hung 
on each side from the crook-saddle. Many of them are of beau- 
tiful symmetry. The sheep are principally of the black-faced 
breed, rather small; but the mutton good, and very sweet; and 
Lewis beef, when for a short time on mainland pasture, is prover- 
bial for delicacy and fineness. 

Hogs are not numerous, as the natives have a strong antipathy to 
them and their flesh. More swine and fewer horned cattle would

be more profitable for a Lewis man, in the present state of the 
market ; because, for his two year old stots, he will sometimes not 
get above L. 1; and for a pig one year old, he will get the same, and 
a ready market for ship stores. Besides, one pig for making manure 
IS better than two stots. Black cattle are sold fram L. 1 to L. 6 
per head; sheep from 5s. to 10s. per head; lambs from Is. 6d 
to 4s. 6d. ; horses from L. 3 to L. 7 of the small kind,-others used 
by the farmers from L. 10 to L. 20, 

The fresh water lochs are numerous, and contain black trout 
of a small size. In the three rivers, the Creid, Tong, and Gress, a 
lew salmon and sea-trout are caught, by the trawl. 

Insects.~The common fly is here abundant; and the midge or 
Hebridian musquito is most annoying before rain. Out-door la- 
bourers find It impossible to work, without being veiled. Bees in 
general are not numerous ; there are only three hives in the island • 
the first was imported three years ago from Ferrintosh, and thev 
have not increased much. Wet winters and springs drown the 
wild bees nests. The bees most commonly met with, are the Jpis 
muscorum, or cording-bee, and the Jpis lapidaria or red-tailed 
bee. It IS really surprising to find any field or wild honey here, 
since Flora s flowery mantle is so very bare. There are very few 
Iruit trees in the parish to be a prey to insects 

Shell-Jish.~ki Tong, Coll, Gress, and Melbost sands, in the 
broad bay a great variety of shell-fish is found ;_clams, mussels 
hmpets whelks, razor-fish, and cockles. All these kinds are found 
on the Melbost sands, after a severe storm. The natives expect a 
bursting of the shell-fish banks, once in seven years; then m 
mense masses are thrown up and found at low water; bu this 
bursting happens oftener than once in the seven years. The re 
porter has seen huge heaps thrown ashore, twice during that pe-" 
riod,-wh,ch employed many carts and creels, for severfl days in 
carrying them away for food and manure; the sea-fowl screaming 
for the depredations committed on their provision and territory  
n the sands of Tong, fine large blue cockles are foundry 
httle inferior to oysters. Scores of children are employed gatherf 
them for the hand-line bait; the fishers parboil Lni ; tty ad- 
here wel to the hook, and the fish seem to' relish them. Lobsters 
are caught and sold at 4d. each. Limpets and the whelk or com-

go out with their boat, having as many cod heads as they can col- 
lect. A cord is drawn through the lip, and fastened so that the 
head may not slip off. Another head is similarly fastened at the 
distance of one yard or fathom, according to the number of heads 
used, and the length of the line; the whole line is then run out, 
sunk, and allowed to remain for an hour or two. Afterwards, they 
begin to raise the heads, and scrape off the buckles which stick to 
the cod's head, — which is then, again let down, as near to the same 
spot as may be, for many more whelks were on their way to the 
feast, that could not be accommodated at the first course, — but in 
succession these are taken by the process now described. The 
boatmen are kept busy while they remain. 

Botany, — Nature has not been bountiful to this region, in re - 
gard to plants. The scarcity of money prevents the natives from 
purchasing various articles which might lessen their labour in do- 
mestic purposes, especially in the dyeing of wearing apparel and 
blankets. Till of late, and even now, the dyes ih use are made 
from Erica or heather, or from Senecio jacobcea, common ragwort. 
These boiled with woollen yarn make a yellow dye, or ground for 
blue. Both these bind the colour, so that the blue colour improves 
when washed. The Tormentilla reptans, trailing tormentil or 
Bar-braonan-nan-con chact-bhlar, is used for barking herring-nets 
and hides for leather. The Tussilago hyhrida, butter-bur, or gal- 
lan -mor, and Rumex acetoseUa, sorrel or sealbhag, are used for a 
black dye. 

Dr M'lver, before-mentioned, gives me the following notice : 
" The medicinal plants discovered in this island have been so 
very few, and the quantity in which they were found so trifling, 
that they are wholly undeserving of notice. Indeed heather, of 
which there are many kinds, seems to be the only indigenous pro- 
duction of its soil." 

All the culinary plants in common use, in other parts of Scot- 
land, can be raised, if the soil be previously enriched, and due 
attention paid to the cultivation. Mugwort and wild spinage, 
betony, colts-foot, Plantago major baash phadice, Plantago lan- 
ceolata ribwort, plantain or slan-lus, are occasionally used for 
healing external and internal bruises. 

There is scarcely any wood in the island, except a few bark- 
bound birches in the parish of Lochs. A few trees, for trial, were 
planted on a burn-side, Alt-na-brog, near Seaforth Lodge. These 
seem in a thriving state ; but they are sheltered. Out of Storno-

way, there is scarcely anything like a tree seen, except a few wil- 
lows in gardens, and even these become stunted when they overtop 
the wall. The greater part of the island seems to have been wooded 
m ancient times, as roots of trees are dug out of the moss ; hazel 
nut shells are found, when the people cut their peats, at the depth 
ot 14 feet. According to tradition, the Norwegians, to monopolize 
he timber trade, had set all the wood on fire, when they landed in 
the North Hebrides. But another account is more probable, which 
bears, that, when the invaders were often surprised by the native 
ymgin ambush and sallying forth upon them, they burnt the woods 
that they might see their opponents at a distance in open field, 
and attack them in aperto loco.

Registers. — The earliest entry in the parochial register is dated 
1780; the record was discontinued in 1791. Since 1825, the re- 
gisters have been regularly kept, and weekly entries are made by 
the session-clerk. 

Antiqxdties. — The religious houses or chapels now in ruins are, 
St Collums in Ui ; St Cowstans in Garrabost- ; and St Aula in 
Gress, formerly mentioned. The chapel at Ui has strong walls 
still standing. The south-west end of it is roofed and slated ; the 
minister of Stornoway used to preach there, once in six weeks, be- 
fore the Government church was erected. Part of the walls of St 
Aula remain ; but the chapel near Garrabost is levelled. There 
is a large cairn in the moor, above Gress House, — under which, 
report says, the bones of a Norwegian warrior rest. On the nose 
of the bay which gives name to the town, there is remaining a frag- 
ment of a wall, 12 feet high and 4 feet thick, — the wall of a 
castle built for the protection of the place by the Macleods, the 
ancient possessors of the island ; and at a short distance from this 
castle, Oliver Cromwell is said to have built a tower to awe the in- 
habitants, no vestige of which now remains. One of the streets 
is named Cromwell Street. 

Modern Buildings. — The modern buildings are Seaforth Lodge, 
the church, St John's Lodge or Masons' Hall, neat and spacious ; 
a female school jointly endowed by Mrs S. M'Kenzie and Miss 
Mary M'Kenzie Cam, who gave L. 300 Sterling; three mills, one 
for grinding corn, with a saw-mill and excellent kiln appended 
to it,— the other for carding wool, — all built by the proprietors at 
a considerable expense, and perfectly complete in their kind. Few 
mills in Scotland can surpass them in machinery or in utility; a 
premium was awarded for the carding-mill. There is also a dis- 
tillery on a grand scale, with coppers of large diameter, furnaces, 
vats, coolers, flake-stands under a running stream ; also a very large 
malt-barn and mill. The grain can be received from ships, at the 
barn door. Vessels can be either loaded or unloaded with tlie 
greatest convenience and expedition. The whole premises and 
apparatus are constructed upon the most improved plans. It must 
have cost thousands of pounds to complete such a perfect model. 
No expense had been spared by the spirited proprietor to make it 
complete; but it is not yet in operation. A light-house is being built

Individuals of independent fortune in the parish are few. 

Character, Sfc. of the People. — The people, in strength, com- 
plexion, and size, resemble their neighbours in the Hebrides. 
In general, they are more swarthy than the people on the mainland ; 
but this is occasioned by their being enveloped in the peat-smoke 
of their houses. They are capable of bearing great fatigue and a 
long fast. 

Gaelic is the language generally spoken. It has lost ground very 
little except in Stornoway ; and even there, all born in the town 
speak Gaelic, though the principal inhabitants prefer the English, 
Throughout the parish, the Gaehc is a good deal corrupted, for many 
interlard their sentences by introducing English words with the 
termination ikuk, such as callikuk and meanikuk, viz. calling and 
meaning, &amp;c. The names of farms are evidently derived from the 
Danes and Norwegians, as Tolsta, Shadir, and Sheshadir, which 
signify six men, or a portion of land sufficient to support six fanu- 
lies. Bost denotes a farm, as Garrabost, the short rigged farm, 
and Melbost, the honeyed or pleasant farm. 

The principal amusements are the club and shinty, quoits or 
discus, and the putting-stone. In the town of Stornoway, the ha- 
bits of the people resemble those of their neighbours in the south : 
they have neat slate houses, many of which are not only well but 
elegantly furnished. The inhabitants of the town are active and 
public spirited, forming a striking contrast to the rest of the parish 
and of the island. The houses in the country, excepting the tacks- 
men's, are sordid huts— in general, indescribably filthy. There is 
only an annual sweeping of their houses. The people and cattle 
are under the same roof and on the same area. Very few of the 
country dwellings have a single pane of glass. There is one hole 
in the roof to allow the excess of smoke to escape, and another on 
the top of the wall,— the latter at night or during a storm through 
the day being stopped with a wisp. Where a sufficient supply of 
stones can be found, the walls of the houses are from four to six 
feet thick, and consist of an outer and inner face,— the intervenmg 
space being crammed with earth or pounded moss. Wood is so 
scarce and so dear, that it cannot be had in sufficient quantity to 
make a good roof. A rafter twelve feet long and three inches m 
diameter, will cost 3d.; and other timber, in proportion. The 
roofs have no eaves. The thatch, in general, is made of stiibble 
or potato stalks which are spread on the scanty wooden roof, and 
bound by heather or straw ropes, which again arc, at each side of

the sea is open, and plenty of shell-fish on the shore, they cannot 
be in absolute want. 

The dress of the country people in this parish is made of kelt 
and plaiden, their own manufacture ; their coats and short clothes 
are made of gray and blue stuff; cotton and check shirts are worn 
on Sundays ; but through the week, plaiden shirts, Hebridian 
flannel. 

Though the people, in general, have not the many comforts which 
others in the south enjoy, they have fewer wants, and are easily 
satisfied. Their principal complaint is of high rents and short 
leases. They possess, in general, a pacific disposition ; and are 
remarkably shrewd, inquisitive, quick, communicative, and fond of 
novelty. They possess an inventive genius ; and many of them 
have a poetic vein. Poaching in game or in salmon is not now 
frequent ; and smuggling has decreased very much. There can be 
no doubt that this is rapidly on the decline, since for the last three 
years the quantity of spirits imported has increased in nearly a 
threefold proportion, compared with former years ; and should dis- 
tilleries commence operation in the island as contemplated, under 
the auspices of spirited individuals, illicit distillation would soon 
disappear. Formerly, when each tenant was allowed to convert the 
produce of his little lot into usquebaugh or tres-tarig, that is thrice 
distilled, it was solely to pay his rent,— iUicit distillation had not 
the same deteriorating effect here on the morals of the people as 
on the mainland. It is pleasing to add, that there are few instances 
of inebriety to be met with, out of the town of Stornoway.

Live-stocL-Theve are a few black-faced sheep in the parish. 

I he black-cattle are small in general, but of the true Highland 

stamp, though the breed is low at present. There are 18 Ayrshire 

cows in the parish. Number of cattle, 8000. 

Husbandry..-.T}ieve are a dozen good farms in the parish. On 
these, the south country implements of husbandry may be seen, as 
iron ploughs and harrows; but small tenants and cottars generally 
till the ground by the Chinese plough, of one stilt or haSdle, and 

he cas-chrom, a clumsy instrument like a large club, shod with 
iron at the pomt, and a pm at the ancle for the labourer's foot. It 
IS a disgrace to see women working with it. This antediluvian im- 
plement will soon be superseded by the spade, which has now come 
mto almost general use in this parish. 

The most common mode of turning the ground is by teeming, 
forminga kmd of lazy-bed.. At this work two persons are employed 
one on each side the ridge, which is seldom in a straight liL, col 
lecting the earth ; and the earth borrowed in this way makes a pro- 
per bed for the seed. Hence the scarcity of manure is not so much 

n othe Th '"""' P'--- than 

any other. The ground being prepared, as soon as the season per- 
mits, the seed IS sprmkled from the hand in small quantities; the 
plots of ground being so small, narrow, and crooked, should the seed 
be cast as in large long fields, much of it would be lost. Afte o"- 
ing the seed, a harrow with a heather brush at the tail of it is used 
which men and women drag after them, by means of a rope ac os 
their breast and shoulders. The women ai. miserable slaves they 
do the work of brutes, carry the manure in creels on theii iackl

piled above another Hke slates on the roof of a house, from the 
bottom to the top of the stack, which is in shape Hke a cone. The 
whole convex surface of the stack is tightly laced round, by heather 
ropes, and made as tight as a bottle. The residue of the roots is 
for thatch. . 

Though this method of husbandry common in the island may 
appear absurd, laborious, and tedious to strangers, the climate and 
necessity have hitherto obliged the people to adopt it. If the na- 
tives had the means to purchase proper implements of husbandry, 
and were ordered by those in authority to pursue a different plan of 
tillage, the island would have, in a few years, a very different as- 
pect ; and without doubt the climate would change to the better. 

A great deal has been done, during the last ten years, and much 
more might still be done, in reclaiming waste land, —if there were 
men of capital in the island. There is a large field ; and moss mixed 
with shelly sand and sea-ware, would give a good crop, and be no 
bad subject to work upon ; for were the moss consumed till within 
nine inches, and the clay subsoil properly mixed with it, in a few 
years it would make good mould, if well manured. 

All the leases in the parish have nearly expired ; but they will 
be renewed. The parish being entailed, leases cannot properly 
be for more than nineteen years. 

• All the farm-buildings require repairs, except Sandwich, Gress, 
and Laxdale cottage. The farm houses of Agnish Coll, Goat-hill, 
Holm shades, and Tolsta, would require a considerable sum to 
make them habitable and comfortable. Some dikes lately built 
are very good, and many others somewhat decayed. 

Four large fields close to Seaforth Lodge, and fronting Storno- 
way, have been lately much improved by Mr S. Mackenzie. 

Quarries. — The best quarry in the parish is between Garrabost 
and Port-na-guiran ; but the greater part of the stone used in 
building rubble work in Stornoway, is imported either from the 
mainland or the parish of Lochs. There is no freestone in the island. 

Fisheries. — The fishing of cod, ling and herrings, is the princi- 
pal employment of the male population in the country : every farm 
and hamlet have their boats, except a few on Melbost. The sea- 
son is divided between fishing, farming, and kelping ; and most fa- 
milies have a share of a boat and a lot of land. One hundred and 
twenty tons of cod and ling are annually caught and cured in the 
parish, and shipped for Ireland and the Clyde, &amp;c. The average 
price per ton for cod is L. 12, and for ling L. 15. Herrings have 



LEWIS STORNOWAY. 233 

not been abundant for several years. They are on the coast; but the 

people are not acquainted with the deep sea fishing, and their 

boats and nets are not fit for the operation. 

The Broad-bay flounder is the finest in the world. The laithe 

far surpasses the whiting, in delicacy and sweetness. Hake is a 
strong coarse fish, but when salted, in spring is not disagreeable 
tood. boles, tusk, and conger-eels are caught; whales, grampus 
and porpoise run ashore, and are often driven ashore by the fish' 
ers m numbers amounting to 150 or more, and varying from 5 to 
oO teet m length. ' 

The haddock is the general favourite, and is to be had, at all 
seasons, m the Broad-bay. There is always a ready sale for it, in 
Stornoway,m sprmg, when the salt-beef becomes tough. Haddocks 
tetch Is. per dozen; at other seasons, they are sold for halfpence 
a-piece. The country people smoke them ; and putting salt into 
their eyes, the brine runs down the bone and keeps the fish from 
corrupting; It gives the fish a peculiar, but no unpleasant taste. 
Cured in this way, tiey are little inferior to Finnan haddocks. 
This p an was resorted to, when the salt was scarce and dear, and 
It IS still adhered to. In the harvest season, about the end o/ Oc- 
tober the natives, in calm weather, repair at night to the shore 
mth blankets sowed end to end; and at the mouths of the rivers 
.here the foi-d is shallow, they cross and drag with them one end of 
he Cham of blankets. They beat the water to frighten the young 
try, which are very numerous; and hauling the blankets like a net 
against the stream, they drive the cuddie fish to the sandy beach 
In one night, by two hauls of six blankets, twenty-four barrels of 
cuddies ave been caught. Immense quantities come up th fr thf 
and shallows about the end of harvest. The fish is sweet and fat 
From their livers, a great quantity of oil is obtained, which is some- 
.mes sold at Is. 3d per pint when scarce; at present it fe tches To 
more than 7d. When fresh the cuddies are sold at 4d. per peck

Manufactures. — Mrs S. M'Kenzie attempted to instruct the 
natives in straw-plaiting ; and for that purpose brought two stran- 
gers to the island, and gave them a salary, for a considerable time. 
Several young girls were taught ; but the work is discontinued at 
present. The Craggans, formerly mentioned, are made by the 
natives. The red clay is kneaded as smooth as glazier's putty, 
the vessel is fashioned by one hand inside, the other on the out- 
side, till it is brought to the size and shape required. After hard- 
ening in the sun for a time, a peat fire is kindled around it, till it 
becomes red. Warm milk is then poured into it, and as the milk 
boils, the outside is bathed with it. This gives it a polish or gloss. 
If it does not crack, it is considered a good dish ; and the boiled 
milk is drunk by the potters. 

Kelp is the principal manufacture in the parish. It is almost 
impossible to tell how many are employed in the work, — for young 
and old, male and female, all who are able to carry a creel of ware, 
or help to fill it, are engaged in manufacturing it at different times, 
for three months, from the time of cutting the ware till the sohd 
mass is weighed on board the vessel. The price of kelp varies 
from L. 1, 10s. to L. 3, 3s. per ton; at L. 3. 3s. per ton, the sum may 
be as much as the man and wife in one family could earn in three 
months, by any other work ; but the toil in cutting, drying, burning 
the ware, and watching the pot night and day, till the ware is convert- 
ed to boiling lava, is terrible, and would require extraordinary wages. 
This process, if not injurious to health, is ruinous to the eyes. How 
this manufacture affects their morals, farther experience will dis- 
close. 

I add the following remarks upon the kelping system. It is 
true, that proprietors of land and kelp shores got a good round 
sum for kelp, when the price was high, — nearly L. 20 clear profit 
per ton ; but they know from experience, that this commodity is 
very fluctuating in price, especially since barilla has been substi- 
tuted for kelp. The price of kelp is not now worth the trouble 
of manufacturing it ; but had the ware burned and exported been 
given to fields in culture, or put upon new tilled land, to stimulate 
and feed it, the profits though not so large, would be annual, yea 
perennial, and in the course of a nineteen years lease, the old

arable land would retain its stamina, and the new land would be 
pulverizing ; the rents would then be certain and easily secured. 
Besides, at the end of the lease, the lots or farms would be worth 
at least double the former rent. But when thousands are engaged, 
all the summer season, making kelp, their crofts and lots are ne- 
glected, potato fields are overrun with weeds, consequently the 
return is small, and part of the gain by kelping is lost in their 
potato crop ; their cattle are much neglected ; corn fields are de- 
stroyed ; and the tenants distressed for their rents. Many of the 
herd boys that should attend the cattle during the summer heats, 
are kelping; many beasts are lost in mossy veins, and fall from 
rocks, when they run wild during an excessively hot day,— so 
that in this way, the gain by kelp becomes a loss. The kelping 
system is thus a great obstacle to agricultural improvement. It 
is the opinion of many, that the manufacture of kelp has injured 
the fishing trade on the Lewis coast, because the smoke is injurious 
to the fish ; because the ware from which the kelp is manufactured, 
is supposed to be a great part of the food of the fish ; and because 
the kelp ware is supposed to be a shelter or covert to the finny fry 
from their numerous voracious enemies. 

Whatever be the cause, it is very evident that herrings and dog- 
fish do not visit the shores of Lewis, in such large bodies, as before 
the kelping system began ; for, by dog-fish oil alone, the tenants in 
Ness, parish of Barvas, paid their rents; and the take of herrings is 
triflmg compared to what had been formerly. In the fifty miles 
of coast in this parish, 3000 barrels have not been caught and 
sent to market, for the last five years. Though the manufacture 
ot kelp should entirely cease, years may elapse before the fish vi- 
sit the friths and lochs, in such immense bodies as formerly. 

Navigation—The number of vessels belonging to the port is 67 
the whole tonnage 3059. The smallest is 15 tons, the largest 
142 tons. The number of boats, in the district of the port, regis- 
tered, amounts to 1500. 

A very considerable number of foreign vessels, and British ves- 
sels from and to foreign parts, put into the harbour of Stornowav • 
but the number of foreign vessels importing cargoes, does not, on 
an average, exceed one each year. 

In Stornoway, there is a well-regulated custom-house ; a col- 
lector, comptroller, and tide-waiter.

rish ; the otlier towns or hamlets consist of tenants' houses built at 
the head of their lots. 

Stornoway Proper is a burgh of barony, and contains a population 
of 1000 souls. Bay-head, Guirshadir, and Laxdale adjoining, con- 
tain nearly 900 ; on the north side of the town, Inailite, Sandwich, 
and Holm, quite contiguous, contain as many ; Stenish, Culna- 
groin, and Cross Street contain a population of 130, which makes 
a total of almost 3000 in the immediate vicinity of the town, at no 
greater distance from the burgh than one mile. 

Stornoway is the chief town in the Northern Hebrides. It has 
gradually increased from a paltry hamlet of a dozen houses, to the 
size and importance of a considerable town, containing several 
streets within the barony, namely. South Beach, North Beach, 
Point Street, Kenneth Street, Cromwell Street, Church Street, 
Kieth Street, and Francis Street, Bay-head, &amp;c. 

Sheriff and Commissary Courts, Bailie, Excise, and Justice of 
Peace Courts are here held regularly. 

Means of Commnnication. — The nearest market-town is Ding- 
wall, which is 120 miles from Stornoway. The means of commu- 
nication are by vessels, and the weekly packet between Poolewe 
and Stornoway. There is one post-office. The average income 
of the post-office is L. 330. Government pays L. 150 per annum. 
The yearly proceeds would afford a better packet than the one 
employed. 

There are no turnpike roads. In the last Statistical Account, 
I find that road-making commenced in 1791 ; and in 1796 four 
miles of the Barvas road were made. Though at that period the mak- 
ing of a road betwixt Stornoway and Uig, was supposed " to re- 
quire the labour of many ages," there is now a tolerable road 
made from sea to sea, the distance of twenty miles : and since that 
time, there are nearly 200 miles of road made by statute labour. 
Moss is found to be an excellent elastic foundation for a road, when 
covered with gravel and red clay till. They ai"e in a shocking state 
of repair. A layer of nine inches of such road metal as is to be 
found here, is absolutely necessary to make them comfortable. 

There is not a stone bridge across a river in the island to my 
knowledge, though the waters are often dangerous, and lives are 
lost by the impetuous torrents. The principal harbour is Loch 
Stornoway, where there is safe anchorage for an indefinite number 
of vessels. There are several good quays along the North Beach.

Ship-carpenters are daily employed; and each shipowner has his

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situate on Kirkhill 
in the town of Stornoway. It is only convenient for the population' 
in and near the town. From the farm of Tolsta, which contains 250 
souls, the church is twelve miles distant ; and six miles of a pathless 
moor are very rugged. Tong, where the manse is built, is bv the 
new road four miles from church, and between the manse and Tol- 
sta, there is a population of 1200 without a seat in church, and 
destitute of any place of worship, viz. Drum-bheag and Aird of 
Tong, containing 200 souls, Garra-Ghuism, 50, Upper and Nether 
Coll, 222, Vateikis and Rack, 399, Gross, 122, and Tolsta 250, 
—in all 1253 souls. The present church was built in 1794. It is 
mentioned in the last Statistical Account, thus : " A very elegant 
church was lately built at Stornoway. The internal economy is 
very nearly finished." Three years ago, the people of the parish 
became alarmed about the insufficiency of the front wall, and the 
weight of the roof,— when partial repair was given to it;' but this 
did not remove the alarm, the front wall was still off the plumb 
line several inches; the wall receded from the seats in the g-al 
lery, and no consideration would make the people enter to attend 
divine service. 

After the present incumbent's petition was laid before the pres- 
bytery, the feuars in Stornoway, conjointly with the ministers, laid 
the proceedings of presbytery before Messrs Mackenzie and Cock 
burn,trusteesforthe Seaforth property. They agreed that all should 
be assessed, according to their several interests. The repairs there 
upon commenced, and are now on the eve of being finished. When 
these are completed, the church will not be surpassed by any in 
the Western or Northern Hebrides.  

The feuars generously and unanimously voted to the present 
incumbent, a session-house or vestry adjoining the back wall of the 
church,-wherem he can rest, during the interval between the cfe 
he and English services. 

Theoriginal sum expended in building the church was L 900-

There is only accommodation or legal seat-room for 800 persons, 
though two-thirds of the examinable people between Tolsta and 
Stornoway amount to 2000. In Stornoway and its immediate vi- 
cinity, there are 2000 examinable persons that could attend, if they 
had room in church. From the manse at Tong to Tolsta, as 
above-mentioned, there is a population of 1200 ; two-thirds of the 
examinable persons amount to 500 entitled to legal accommoda- 
tion in church, — but there is none for them. The minister used to 
preach, once a month at Back, a farm belonging to the district of 
Gress ; but the preaching-house there was thrown down, rebuilt, 
and converted into a school-house, not capable of containing more 
than 200 persons crammed together. There can be no free sit- 
tings in a church, from which more than 2000 persons are exclud- 
ed for want of room. 

The present manse was built twenty-five years ago, during Mr 
M'Kenzie's incumbency; the office-houses, during the late Mr 
Simson Eraser's. The roof of the manse is in an insufficient state ; 
and during a storm, walls and windows admit rain. 

The glebe is eight acres arable in extent, with a little rugged 
wet, deep, mossy moor. In the Statistical Account before me the 
glebe is valued at L. 5. The present glebe is an excambed one. 
The former glebe and manse were in Stornoway. That glebe is 
now feued and farmed ; — bringing Mr S. M'Kenzie annually an 
amount equal to the minister's stipend. The present glebe at Tong 
was designed on the 5th day of October 1759. By that designa- 
tion and excambion, the grass glebe alone should " support six cows 
coupled, and their followers till four years old, with four horses," 
making at least thirty head of cattle and horses ; but the glebe 
enjoyed by the present incumbent cannot support the one-half of 
that number. 

The amount of stipend paid by the proprietor is L. 99. The 
other sum is paid by the Barons of Exchequer, which brings the 
stipend to L. 150 Sterling annually. 

There are no chapels of ease here. There is one Government 
church, built in the district of Ui, four miles from the parish church, 
at the extremity of the district, in the most inconvenient situation, 
for 800 out of a population of 1308. There are no missionaries, 
but one is very much required for the district of Gress. There is 
one catechist, employed by the Society for Propagating Christian 
Knowlege. 

There are no dissenters of any denomination. Many have at-

tempted to establish meeting-houses, but were not successful. The 
people, though fickle, have an attachment to the Established Kirk. 
There is a local missionary society formed here, not " subject to 
local authority." The number of communicants at the last sacra- 
ment did not exceed 40. 

The annual amount of church collections for religious and cha- 
ritable purposes averages L. 30 Sterling. 

Education.— The total number of schools is 13 : one' parochial 
school; one from the S. P. Christian Knowledge ; two from the 
GaeHc School Society ; one female school endowed by Mrs M'Ken- 
zie, and Miss Mary Cam, formerly mentioned. In this school, 60 
scholars are taught reading, writing, and sewing, Mrs S. M'Ken- 
zie having sent the female teacher to Edinburgh, to learn the system 
taught in the School of Industry there ; salary about L. 20, with 
free lodgings in the seminary. 

There are two schools supported by the country people, in Knock 
and Melbost ; three supported by Mrs S. M'Kenzie and the people 
conjunctly ; three are unendowed, or chance schools. There was 
one upheld by individual subscription, in which the fashionable 
branches were taught to a limited number of scholars ; salary L. 60, 
including fees. It was discontinued lately. 

In the grammar and parochial school, all the branches consti- 
tuting a classical education are taught. The parochial teacher's 
salary is only L. 32. The amount of school fees does not exceed 
L. 20, and is seldom so much, as many are taught gratis, and the 
fees are ill paid. The parochial teacher has not the legal accom- 
modation. 

The annual expense for English reading, is from 10s. 6d. to 
14s ; for Latin and the higher branches L. 1, 4s., for each scholar. 
The number between six and fifteen years of age, who cannot read, 
IS 586. The number upwards of fifteen who cannot read is 1265 

Literature.— There is one circulating library, established by Sea- 
rorth and his lady. 

/riendly Societies.-There are two Friendly Societies and a 
Masons Lodge. The lodge existed since 1767, and in four years 
distributed L. 300. The Trades Society was formed in 1769 ; the 
Friendly Society, since 1 80 1. Both give nearly 5s. per week to each 
sick member. 

The Hon. Mrs S. M'Kenzie is very charitable to the poor,- 
givmg medicine, food, and clothing to the necessitous. 

Bank.— There is a branch of the National bank in Stornoway. 



140 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor receiving pa- 
rochial aid is 219. The average sum given to each, is 5s. The 
average amount of collections is L. 30. The interest arising from 
legacies varies, together with the mulcts levied from delinquents; 
and out of the combined amount, precentors, beadle, session-clerk, 
and part of the catechist's salaries are paid. The whole amount 
distributed in 1830 was L. 52 Sterling. 

Prisons. — There is not one prison for a population of 14,000 in 
the island of Lewis. 

Fairs. — Near Stornoway, there is a square mile of moor inclos- 
ed for an annual tryst or cattle-market, where several thousand 
head of cattle are exposed for sale, and two thousand at least 
change owners, in two days. The prices and demand depend on the 
southern markets. From 20 to 30 drovers or cattle-dealers come 
from the mainland, and some from England. The market or 
tryst always holds on the second Wednesday of July annually, by 
advertisement ; and the packet waits to bring purchasers across the 
Minch. 

Inns. — In Stornoway there are 18 houses regularly licensed 
for the vending of spirituous liquors. This number comprises four 
respectable inns, namely, the Royal Oak, • Crown, Star and New 
Inn ; seven are shops, and the remaining seven miscellaneous ; but 
which perhaps would be better distinguished under the appellation 
of petty public-houses, the pest of the morals of the people. The 
quantity of spirits imported last quarter, is 802 gallons, and the 
quantity brought in from the distillery in the neighbouring parish 
is 328 gallons. The stocks on hand are invariably very inconside- 
rable. These two quantities added together, and quadrupled, may 
be fairly estimated as the consumption for the year 1831, which, 
calculatedat the present rate of duty, yields to his Majesty's Trea- 
sury the sum of L. 753, 6s. 8d. The quantity exported per annum 
is about 300 gallons. Annual consumption 4520 imperial gal- 
lons. 

Fuel. — The fuel consists of English and Scotch coal, and most 
excellent black peats. Coals are sold at L. 1, Is. per ton ; peats, 
to those who have no carts to lead them home, are almost as dear 
as coal. The peat-cutting season is one of joy and hilarity. Eggs, 
butter, cheese, and whisky are brought to the peat bank.

PEESBYTERY OF LEWIS, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. WILLIAM MACRAE, MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 
The parish of Barvas is situated in the northern extremity of 
the Island of Lewis, extending from south-west to north-east, along 
the shore of the Atlantic, about 22 miles in length,— and from the 
shore southward towards the interior of the island, about 7 miles 
in breadth. It originally embraced a district called Ness, at the 
eastern extremity, where there is a Government church, and 
which has been erected into a separate parish called Cross. Bar- 
vas, as now constituted, after the disjunction, is only 12 miles long, 
and 7 miles broad, making in all 84 square miles. 

Na/ne.—lts name is thought to be Norwegian, in common with 
that of many other places in the Hebrides ; but its signification is 
not known. 

Boundaries, cc— It is bounded on the west, by the parish of 
Lochs i on the south, by the parishes of Stornoway and Lochs ; on 
the east, by the parish of Cross ; and on the north, by the Atlantic 
ocean. Its figure is an irregular parallelogram, having the side 
to the north in nearly a straight line along the sea coast, indented 
by a few confined bays. 

Topographical Appearances.—Theve are no hills or mountains 
that can be so called, the whole parish being almost one continu- 
ed flat of mossy muir, with the exception of the cultivated inha- 
bited part along the shore, which, upon an average, is not one mile 
m breadth. The vallies or glens, where the streams flow, are 
consequently of very inconsiderable depth. The coast being 
bold and rocky, there are some caves or fissures ; but none worthy 
ot notice. The extent of the coast may be about 14 miles, all ex- 
tremely rugged and inaccessible, except four small bays or creeks, 
where small boats can sometimes land ; but no vessel can venture 
to anchor, on account of the surf, which is generally high, and with 

as L'meSnfllif """f' fof'med into a separate parish q,wad sacra, in so far 
as the present account of Barvas djes not apply to it, will be noticed hereafter.

a north, north-west, and north-east wind rises most tremendously. 
The bays of Bragar and Barvas, having each a headland of short 
projection attached, are low and partly sandy ; but the bay of Sha- 
dir, though low, is very difficult of access. 

Meteorology. — There being no hilly ranges higher than gentle 
eminences, the country is the more exposed to the destructive vio- 
lence of sea winds, which frequently carry, in their sweeping blasts, 
disappointment to the husbandman. The sea coast, the only arable 
portion of the parish, lies completely open to the north, west, and 
south winds ; and when they come, in harvest, impregnated with 
the noxious vapours of the Atlantic, and often accompanied by 
heavy falls of rain, the crops, particularly the potato, suffer much 
injury. The air is temperately cold, moist, and salubrious, 
to natives; but the atmosphere is always densely charged with 
humid exhalations from the surrounding ocean, and from the 
mossy bogs, lochs, lakes, and water in every shape, with which the 
marshes are plentifully interspersed. From this cause, frost is sel- 
dom intense, and snow generally of short continuance. Dense 
fogs rarely occur. The luminous meteors, rainbow, halo, and 
Aurora Borealis or polar lights, are very frequent and brilliant. The 
glare of the latter sometimes may afford light for reading, and 
their warlike motions are often interesting. As they advance, at 
their first appearance, slowly and majestically, the fertile imagina- 
tion may fancy the cool and stately motion of two mighty hosts 
approaching to the onset, then the hurry and confusion of the 
thickening fight, then the rout, the fugitive and pursuer emerging 
in one another, — until a third party shoots forth as from ambuscade, 
ending the battle, and resigning the firmament to the stars and 
ancient night. 

The prevailing winds are the south and south-west, and are al- 
ways followed by rain, if of more than two days duration. 

The common complaints are, colds, asthmas, and rheumatisms, 
incident to this, in common with all rainy climates ; but a more 
uncommon ailment, for which no remedy has yet been discovered, 
is the five or seven nights sickness, — a disease very fatal to infants, 
and so called from its attacking them on the fifth or seventh night 

Hydrography. — Perennial springs of excellent water are very 
numerous here, issuing for the most part from sand or gravel, se- 
veral of them of a chalybeate nature. The moors abound in small 
shallow fresh water lakes and lochs, without surrounding scenery 
or beauty. The rivers take their origin from lochs and springs, 
generally at the distance of six or seven miles from the Atlantic, 



LEWIS 15AUVAR.

into which they fall. They are five in number, the Arnal, Glen, 
Torra, Shadir, and Borve, all which flow with uninterrupted 
smoothness, without cascade or cataract, to the ocean. 

Geology. — Along the whole arable ground, the most striking 
feature in the surface, as well as the composition of the soil, is the 
multitude of stones with which it is overrun, rendering it equally 
injurious to vegetation as unfavourable for culture. The soil is of 
various kinds ; but as the cultivated portion is no more than a nar- 
row fringe, which outskirts the moor, the greatest proportion is 
mossy, varying from 2 to 12 feet deep, and resting on a hard stra- 
tum of clay. The inhabited portion consists either of black earth, 
gravel, or sand; of the latter, there are banks between the manse and 
the shore, near 20 feet high, which are making gradual encroachments 
into the interior, from the constant action of the westerly winds, to 
which they lie exposed. The bank retains its depth as it advances, 
while it leaves behind a level expanse of sand, probably of greater 
depth than itself, and having its surface overspread with a vast vari- 
ety of whelks, limpets, and the remains of shell-fish similar to those 
commonly found at present on the sea shore. 

Zoology. — The more numerous species of animals in this pa- 
rish, are the most common throughout Scotland, and to all appear- 
ance have undergone no change through the lapse of ages in in- 
crease or diminution. In the moors, are considerable flocks of red 
mountain deer {Cervus elaplius .- otters {JLiitra mustela, in the 
rivers: and hares {L. timidus, and rats [M. decumanus, in the 
meadows. 

Birds. — The land fowl are hawks {Falco, ravens C corax and 
carrion crows C. corone, with the numerous smaller birds which 
abound in the western islands, such as the lark [Alauda arvensis, 
land-rail {Rallus crex, lapwing {Tringa vanellus, plover {Cha- 
radrius, pigeon {Columba JEnas, moorfowl {Tetrao Scoticus, 
snipe {Scolopax gallinago, curlew {S. arquata, thrush [Tur- 
dus mnsicus, starling {Sturnus vulg. ; robin-red- breast MotoaV- 
la rubecula, wren [M. Troglodytes, wagtail M alba. ; sparrow 
{Fringilla domestica, swallow Hirundo, sand martin {H. ripa- 
ria. The waterfowl are the swan {Anas cygnus, gray goose {A. 
anser, teal {A. crecca, duck A. boschas, raingoose, cormo- 
rant {Pelecanus carbo, soland-goose P. Bassanus, gull Larus 
canus, and marinus, crane {Ardea grus. 

The domestic animals reared are, horses, black-cattle, and sheep, 
all of a very diminutive breed. The horses are well-shaped, hardy

and mettlesome, well adapted for carrying burdens of peat and ware 
through broken rugged ground, in creels suspended by the crook- 
saddle. The beef and mutton are of a superior quality. 

The rivers contain well-flavoured trout in considerable numbers. 
Good salmon are caught, annually, on the Barvas river. They 
come up in June when access is open to them ; spawn towards the 
latter end of September, and return to the sea in the beginning 
of winter. Ling, cod, and dog-fish are sometimes fished. These, 
together with herring and every other variety of fish caught on 
the south side of the island, frequent this coast in great numbers ; 
but the inhabitants are unable to benefit by them, without peril- 
ling their lives in the tempestuous ocean which surrounds them. 
With the exception of a very few days in summer and harvest, 
terrific surges, crested with foam, may be seen rolling to the shore, 
with unremitting violence. 

The horse-fly and the common house-fly abound in their season ; 
but the insect best known, from the torture it often inflicts, is a 
species of gnat commonly called the " midge," which, without some 
safeguard covering on the face, will interrupt any out-door occupa- 
tion. In such seasons of scarcity as the present, a great part of 
the sustenance of many of the natives for some weeks is the com- 
mon whelk, limpet, and crab, — the only shell-fish to be found on the 
coast. 

Botany. — The botanist has here but little scope for his pursuits. 
Not a vestige of wood, or tree, and scarcely of a shrub except the 
wild heath, is visible on the surface of the earth. This gives the 
country a barren stunted appearance. Yet the deficiency cannot 
be altogether imputed to the poverty of the soil ; for roots and 
trunks of fir, oak and hazel, with hazel-nuts, are frequently found 
imbedded in a great depth of moss, — confirming the current opinion, 
that these northern countries, at some remote period, have under- 
gone some sweeping and desolating revolution. Gardens, when 
properly cultivated, produce good culinary vegetables, and are ca- 
pable of bringing fruit-bushes to maturity. 

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The only parochial register extant in this 
parish, dates its earliest entry from the year 1810; — since which 
time, baptisms, marriages, and distribution of poor funds have 
been regularly registered. 

Antiquities.— A\most every populous village in the parish had 
formerly a small Popish Chapel attached to it, and adjoining

thereto, burying-grounds, which still serve their original purpose. 
They are all now crumbling into ruins, and one of them has al- 
ready disappeared in the sand. The names applied to them were, 
St Bridget in Borve, St Peter's in Lower Shadir, St Mary's in' 
Barvas, and St John's in Bragar ; but these appellations are now 
obsolete. Southward of Bragar, on the border of a loch, are the 
rums of a circular tower diin or Danish fort, well adapted for 
defence, built solely of large stones, three stories high, taperina 
towards the summit, with a double wall, bound by large flags,— 
which at the same time form a winding staircase in the interior of 
the wall, by which one may go round the building. Three more 
similar ruins are to be seen between Shadir and Borve, two of 
them situated on small islands, in the centre of lochs, and cause- 
ways leading to each, or rather stepping-stones, so artfiilly ar- 
ranged, that an enemy who ventured to attack them or advance 
to their fortress, must, from the zigzag direction, and the deep pits 
made purposely to intervene, have proceeded with the greatest cau- 
tion, or been precipitated into one of those gulfs,-and, should a band 
have been observed attempting to cross over,'hardly any so exposed, 
during the delay thus occasioned, would escape the deadly arrows 
of the besieged. The third ruin stands at some little distance 
trom the shore, with which it was supposed to have a subterra- 
neous communication,-an opinion resting on no other authority than 
tradition. In a plain of moss between Barvas and Shadir, there 
IS an immense stone 18 feet high, and nearly the same in cir- 
cumference, standing almost perpendicular, and no other stone 
nearer than the shore, which is half a-mile distant. Unless it 
was placed there by some mechanical power, there can be no bet- 
ter proof that there were " giants in those days." In either case, it 

skill m this island. Some suppose it was erected in memo-y of a na- 
tjve chief who fell there. The tradition of a bloody battle' between 
the native tribes having been fought in its immediate vicinity might ' 
seem to countenance this opinion. In those lawless times, wtn

were all slaughtered without mercy, by the superior numbers of their 
foes ; — and, accordingly, there is a small eminence at a little dis- 
tance called " Druim nan Caiman," or the hill of tumuli, where 
the remains of the slain are supposed to be interred. But as there 
is no other specimen of such monuments in the island, it is more 
probable that the stone was erected as the foreign sounding name 
" Clach an Trushial" may import, to commemorate the fall of 
one of those famous invaders, who were wont to commit depreda- 
tions on this island ; perhaps some mighty Dane, or one of those 
" sons of Lochlin," of whom the " Bard of other times" delight- 
ed to sing, particularly when laid low by the hand of his father, 
the mighty Fingal. 

III. — Population. 
Of the parish of Barvas, as at present constituted, the popula- 
tion cannot be correctly ascertained previous to the year 1821. 
Every census formerly taken included the district of Cross, now 
detached. The earhest on record thus taken of Barvas and Cross 
together was Dr Webster's in 1755, when the population was 
1995; by the former Statistical Account, the number of souls then 
was 2006. In 1821, it was 2568; and in 1831 it amounted to 
3011. The population of Barvas alone, since the disjunction, will 
in twenty years more, at its present rate of increase, equal that of 
both parishes, as stated by Dr Webster, or, in other words, in one 
century will be nearly doubled. This rapid increase arises from 
a general inclination to marry young— from the want of any outlet 
for the superabundant population by emigration or otherwise,— and 
from the numerous subdivisions of lots consequent on this accumu- 



lation.

LEWIS — BARVAS. J4Y 

The inhabitants are all agricultural, and of the few that are ar- 
tisans none devote their time exclusively to their trades. 

Character, Language, and Habits of the People.— The inhabitants 
are about the middle size, of a sallow complexion, probably occa- 
sioned by the peat smoke in which they are constantly enveloped 
The men are well-proportioned, hardy, robust, and healthy, and 
the women are modest, comely, and many of them good-looking. 
Ihe Gaelic is the only language, and has been from time imme- 
niorial; and it is spoken, in the opinion of competent judges, with 
grammatical correctness and classical purity. In their habits, much 
cleanliness can scarcely be expected, considering their poverty 
and the wretchedness of their habitations, especially while the 
present system, which has prevailed for ages, continues, of having 
the cattle under the same roof with themselves, entering at the 
same door, and allowing their manure to accumulate without beinff 
removed except once a year. Their mode of living most closely 
approaches the pastoral :-without arts, trade, or manufacture, na- 
vigation or hterature, their whole round of duty consists in secur- 
ing fuel, in sowing and reaping their scanty crops, and in rearing 
their flocks, and tending them at pasture. Yet in these limited 
circumstances, while supplied with food and clothing of the plain- 
est description, and able to pay their rents, their simple cottages 
are abodes of happiness and contentment. Blue kelt is almost 
the only dress worn by the men, and stuffs, variously striped, bv the 
M-omen, with under dresses of plaiding, all home made. In many 
instances, however, cotton shirts and print gowns are beginning 
0 supersede the use of some of these articles. The formation of 
the female hibits, with their whole appearance, closely resembles 
that of the " Wandering Bavarians," or Swiss " buy a broom'' 
singers, who itinerate through this country. 

Their ordinary food consists of oat and barley meal, potatoes 
and milk, variously prepared Their domestic econom; \ tZx 
and moderate beyond conception. The produce of a foreign sof

IV. — Industuy. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The uncultivated portion of 
the parish, and the extensive moors to the southward, which have 
not been accurately measured, and cannot well be estimated, ex- 
ceed the arable land in extent, beyond all proportion. By giving 
proper encouragement, much waste land might, with a profitable 
application of capital, and with little difficulty, be reclaimed. At 
present, there are 1468 acres of land cultivated, or occasionally in 
tillage ; 12,146 in pasture ; and 489 in fine pasture. The rental 
of the whole is L. 1070, being on an average nearly 15s. an acre 
arable, including the value of the pasture attached to it. Each 
tenant is entitled to a souming proportional to his rent, at the 
rate of a cow with her follower till a year old, 8 sheep, and half a 
horse for every pound rent. 

Rate of Wages. — All the artisans in the parish consist of 6 
blacksmiths, and two self-taught carpenters, the former paid by 
the quantity of work, and the latter at the rate of Is. a-day and 
their victuals, and sometimes paid by contract. When farm-la- 
bourers are hired, which is not often the case, they receive Is. per 
day in summer, and 8d. in winter, without victuals. 

Breeds of Live Stock and Husbandry. — There is not the slight- 
est attention paid by the people, to the improvement of their breed 
of cattle. They are satisfied if they multiply in proportion to the 
annual sale. Upwards of 2500 are reared in the parish, and fed 
in winter principally on ware or sea-weed. The sheep amount to 
triple that number, and are of a more improved breed than formerly. 

In husbandry, there is hardly any improvement or deviation from 
the system which has been followed for centuries. Hitherto, they 
have not attempted draining or trenching, or to imitate in any re- 
spect a better mode of tillage,— owing to their indigence, and to- 
the short duration of their leases, which vary from six to twelve 
years. The minister's plough is the only one in the parish, except 
we admit as such three or four machines so called, having but one 
handle, which the ploughman manages with both hands, stand- 
ing sideways. A little refinement of taste, more than a sense of 
its disadvantages, has in some instances abolished the use of the 
crooked spade, a very indelicate tool for females ; for which the 
common spade is now substituted. As there is no produce export- 
ed from this parish, its amount cannot easily be valued, but may 
be conjectured from the fact, that in no season is it more than bare- 



LEWIS — BARVAS. 149 

ly s ufficient, and sometimes not adequate, to supply the necessi- 
ties of the tenantry. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There are no tawns in this jaarish, nor any market in the coun- 
try, by which the people may be benefited, but that annually held 
at Stornoway in July. In severe seasons, the cattle are not, then, 
in a condition to be disposed of to advantage ; and a loss is thus 
created, which could be remedied, did the markets occur more fre- 
quently. The parish has the benefit of two roads,— one along the 
coast, and another now much out of repair, to Stornoway, the only 
trading town in the island. The communication thither is some- 
times interrupted from want of bridges, when the rivers are im- 
passable during floods. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church occupies a central situation 
in the village, from which the parish' derives its name, and is dis- 
tant from the inhabited parts of the parish, five miles from one 
extremity, and seven miles from the other. It was built about 
forty years ago, and has been lately well repaired. It is a long 
narrow building without gallery, and affords accomodation for 300 
persons, all of whom have their sittings free. The manse was 
built about sixty years ag'o, and has been also frequently repaired. 
The minister possesses a legal grass glebe, designed in 1815, 
which may, as an accommodation in so remote a situation, be worth 
L. 20 per annum. The stipend is L. 158, 6s. 8d. Sterling, includ- 
ing L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements, of which L. 11 9, 1 6s. is 
paid by the heritor as parochial teind, and the balance, L. 38, 10s. 
8d. is paid from the King's Exchequer. There are no dissenters 
m the parish, nor any other chapels or churches. About 180 fami- 
lies, and from 400 to 500 individuals, are in the habit of attending 
public worship, when the weather permits. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.~The church collections, includ- 
ing fines for petty delicts, do not exceed L. 3 annually, which are 
distributed among 30 paupers. Exclusive of this little aid, the 
maintenance of the poor depends upon the liberality of the te- 
nantry, who are ready to supply them out of their own scanty means. 
To this may be added the generous aid furnished by the proprie- 
tor's lady, the Honourable Mrs Stewart Mackenzie, who is always 
benevolent in ministering to their necessities as often as made 
known, by supplying them with food and clothing. The late 
Mr Angus Nicolson, merchant in Stornoway, has bequeathed 
L. 100, of which the interest is to be given to the poorest of those 



i50 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



next of kin to himself in the parish, and the principal to remain 
untouched. 

Education. — The schools in the parish are 3 in number ; one 
parochial, and two supported by the Edinburgh Gaelic School 
Society, — one in Sbadir, and the other in Arnal. The parish 
schoolmaster is qualified to teach Latin, Greek, arithmetic, and 
the elements of English reading, and receives L. 28 of salary. 
School fees scarcely exceed L. 1. The Gaelic teachers are re- 
stricted exclusively to the Gaelic language or the Gaelic Scrip- 
tures. Their salary is L. 25. 

It is much to be lamented, how little literary knowledge is ap- 
preciated by the people in general. The parochial school is thus 
rendered of less efficiency than it might be, — the abilities of an ex- 
cellent teacher being as little valued as the branches in which he 
is fitted to give instruction. This apathy may arise from their in- 
ability to pay fees, and perhaps in some measure from being ap- 
prehensive that their children may become stimulated by the 
knowledge they acquire, to leave their native country, — a disposi- 
tion highly disapproved of. In a country almost devoid of the 
slightest prospect of advancement, it certainly is, and might na- 
turally be expected to be, the tendency engendered in an educat- 
ed and cultivated mind, to go abroad where some field might be 
found for exertion. This deep-rooted prejudice, formerly a strong 
barrier to literary attainments, is fast losing ground. Itinerating 
schools have been occasionally stationed in various parts of the 
parish, under the patronage of the Gaelic School Society, Edin- 
burgh, and the Inverness Education Society ; and so great is the 
benefit derived from these valuable institutions, that the greatest 
number of the population have been taught to read the Gaelic 
Scriptures. 

Fuel, Sfc. — There are no charitable institutions, prisons, inns or 
alehouses in the parish : and the fuel, which consists of peats, is 
perfectly accessible to all the inhabitants, and very abundant.

PRESBYTEKY OP LEWIS, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER MACLEOD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The word Uig is applied to many situations in the High- 
lands, and signifies a solitary place. It is therefore peculiarly ap- 
plicable to this parish, which is situated on the west coast of the 
Island of Lewis. It is bounded by the Harris mountains on the 
south ; by the Atlantic Ocean on the west ; and on the north by 
a district of the parish of Lochs, which runs across the island from 
east to west. 

Extent, §-c. — The length of the parish is 24 miles, including the 
wide entry of Loch Roag, which runs the distance of 12 miles, 
from west to east. The breadth of the parish is 10 miles, and 
the circumference along the coast 40 miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The interior is more mountainous 
than any other part of the Lewis. The hills are intersected by 
extensive tracts of soft moor and fresh water lakes. The lands, 
for the most part, along the sea shore are low and the soil sandy. 
In the interior, the soil is partly clay, but principally mossy, and is 
everywhere capable of producing forced crops, with the assistance 
of sea weed for manure. 

The bay of Uig is the only notable bay in the parish : it is one 
English mile in breadth. Gallan-head is the most prominent point 
on the coast. It is situated about two miles north from the mouth 
of the bay of Uig, which is much exposed to the sounding Atlantic. 

There, are twelve small islands within the bounds of the parish, 
exclusive of the Flannel Isles, which are seven in number. Of the 
former, four are inhabited ; the other islands are peculiarly adapt- 
ed for pasturing sheep and black-cattle. The Flannel Islands are 
about, fifteen miles from the mainland of the parish. They are sup- 
posed to have been the residence of ecclesiastics in the time of 
the Druids ; and the ruins of their temples in these lonely islands, 
and in several other places in this parish, are still extant.

ROSS AND CROMARTV. 



The atmosphere is ordinarily warm and healthy ; but is gene- 
rally so moist that even deep falls of snow remain no longer than 
a few days on the ground. Although the weather is damp and 
hazy, we have not those torrents of rain and hurricanes of winds, to 
which so many other parts of the Highlands and islands are sub- 
ject. 

On this coast, the south, south-west, and westerly winds are the 
most prevailing, and in winter and spring are generally accompa- 
nied with rain and storm. Hazy weather in winter .prognosticates 
frost, in spring snow, in summer fair weather, and in autumn rain ; 
and it is remarked that, in the stormy months of January and Fe- 
bruary, the greater number of sea-fowls disappear from this coast, 
owing to the exposure of the coast in that season to the storms 
from the Atlantic. The most prevailing distempers in the parish 
are rheumatism, colics, and epilepsy among very young infants. 
If these are not affected with the disease within the ninth or tenth 
day after their birth, they are not afterwards so subject to it. 

Hydrography. — The Frith of Loch Roag runs in a south-east 
direction through the centre of the parish, the length of twelve 
miles. In the narrow parts of the channels of this long arm of the 
sea, the tides run very rapidly, and the water is very salt. 

There are a few small perennial springs in the parish, arising 
out of sandy soil ; their water is clear and cooling in all seasons. 

The parish abounds with fresh water lakes and lochs, the lar- 
gest of which do not exceed two miles in length, and one in breadth. 
They abound with small trout. Their water is of a brownish co- 
lour. Flat moor and low hillocks form the scenery of almost all 
the interior part of the Lewis. 

There are four rivulets in this parish, in which salmon is caught, 
viz. the rivers Grimtsta and Cean Loch, which join the sea at the 
head of Loch Roag ; Resart, which joins the sea at the head of 
Loch Resart; and the Red River, which discharges itself into the 
bay of Uig. 

Zoology. — Black cattle, sheep and horses, all of the small High- 
land breed, have been the kinds reared in this parish, from time im- 
memorial ; but of late years, Cheviot and black-faced sheep have 
been introduced into this parish, with considerable success. 

Oysters, lobsters, and every kind of shell-fish are abundant al- 
most on every part of the shores of Loch Roag ; and English ves- 
sels frequently come here, for several months, to fish lobsters.

II. — Civil History. 

Land-oioner.— James Alexander Stewart M'Kenzie, Esq. of 
Seaforth, is the sole land-owner of this parish. The real rent of 
the parish is L. 2535, 2s. 6d. 

Parochial Reffisters.— Favochial registers have been kept in this 
parish only since the year 1826. There are registers of marriages 
and births. 

Antiquities.— On the Flannel Isles called by Buchanan Insulce 
SacrcB, are still extant the ruins of religious houses. At Mealis- 
ter and Pabay, are the remains of nunneries; and at Callernish, on 
the east coast of Loch Roag, there are the very entire remains of a 
Druidical place of worship ; some of the stones in which are so very 
large, that it is inconceivable by what means they could have been 
brought to the place. They all stand on end, at the distance of 
five and six yards from each other, and are in a rough natural state, 
as taken from the shore. 

At Carloway, there is a Danish fort ordoune, within the bounds 
of this parish,— with a double wall of dry stone,— the largest and 
the most entire I have seen anywhere in Scotland. At the base, it is 
very broad, and towards the top it gradually contracts. The height 
of the wall is computed to be about thirty feet. The fabric upon 
the whole is perfectly circular, and finished in a masterly style 
In the year 1831, a considerable number of small ivory sculptures 
resembling chessmen, and which appeared to be of great antiqui- 
ty, were found in the sands at the head of the bay of Uig, and 
have been since transmitted to the Antiquarian Society at Edin- 
burgh. 

Modern Buildings.— In the year 1824, the manse of Uio- was 
repaired, and a commodious new wing added to it. A new church 
was built m 1829, which will accommodate 1000 people- and in 
this region, where there is so little of what may be called archi- 
tecture, I may notice that several curing houses for cod and hna- 
were erected on the coast, in the year 1826 : and in 1832, Mr and 
Mrs Stewart M'Kenzie of Seaforth erected two commodious school- 
houses and dwelhng-houses for teachers in the districts of Valtos, 
andCallermsh, for the religious and moral improvement of the 

rp, , » , . Ill— Population. 

1 lie people of this parish have always been remarked for their 
•■ospitaluy. rhey are naturally intelligent, and acute and docile 
" tlic.r dispositions ; and have of late years improved much, in 



154 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



cleanliness, morals, and religion. The population is on the in- 
crease, — which may be accounted for by the fact, that the people 
marry young, are in general much attached to their native island, 
and not disposed to leave their native country. They hve to a 
great age, and are in general higher in stature, and of a fresher 
complexion, than the people of the other parishes in this island. 
The Gaelic language is the mother tongue, and is as generally 
and purely spoken now, as it was forty years ago. The people 
have hardly any public games or amusements of any kind. Their 
improvement, of late years, in religious knowledge, has been very 
perceptible, and has taught them to be contented with their 
circumstances and situation in life, and to enjoy and value the 
invaluable privileges of the Gospel dispensation.

The Common Breeds, c. — The small country breeds of sheep, 
horses, and cattle, are still the prevailing breeds of the country. 
Little or nothing is doing for the improvement of lands, — principal- 
ly, I believe, for want of capital. Still the capabilities of the Lewis 
for cultivation are very great. Husbandry is done by the common 
and the crooked spade ; the ground is turned into lazy beds, but 
might easily be cultivated with the plough, in many parts of the 
country. 

Fisheries.— vev since the failure of the herring fishing in Loch 
Roag, the cod and ling fishing is that to which the inhabitants have 
turned their attention. In this, they engage with commendable in- 
dustry, and are frequently very successful. They cure the fish in 
shore-houses, and sell it at 4d. per cod, and 7d. per ling. About thirty 
tons of cod and ling are taken annually : and about 100,000 lobsters 
are annually exported to the London market. They receive no 
bounty or any other encouragement, except the price. 

There are about 80 open boats in the parish, and one decked 
vgssgI 

Manufactures.— Y.e\ is the only manufacture carried on in the 
parish : 226 tons are annually manufactured. The people ma- 
nufacture their home woollen and clothing.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toivn.~tomoSi- is the market-town of the Lewis, 
and is thirty miles from the manse of Uig. It is also the only 
place of a post-office in the whole island. 

Villages— AW the people dwell in little farm villages, in several 
of which are from 40 to 50 families. 

Harbours.~Lod\ Roag is the principal harbour in the parish : 
it is covered with islands. One of them, Large Bernera, is about 
eight miles long, and inhabited. The whole of this curious and 
mteresting arm of the sea abounds with safe places of anchorage, 
sufficient to hold the whole British Navy. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated in the most 
convenient and centrical part of the parish; notwithstanding of 
which, those inhabiting the north and north-east coasts of Loch 
Roag, are thirteen miles from church. The church was built in 
the year 1829, and affords accommodation for 1000 sitters. 
The manse was repaired with additions as I have already stated 
in 1824. The present incumbent has an arable glebe of no great 
Alue, and the amount of stipend is L. 130 Sterling per annum. 
There is one catechist in the parish, appointed and principally 
pported by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. 
Ihe number of communicants is 60. The parishioners, as cir- 
cumstances permit, and exigencies demand, make collections for re- 
ligious and charitable purposes; but the amount of these is small, 
from the extreme poverty of the inhabitants. There is not a mis- 
sion or a Government church in the parish ; but there is an exten- 
sive field for one of these on the north and north-east coasts of 
Loch Roag. There are no dissenters of any description within 
the bounds of the parish. The people's appreciation of religious 
instruction is mcreasing much ; and the attendance on the public 
ordinances of religion here is probably as punctual and full, as in 
any parish in Scotland. 

Education.~Theve are at present five schools in the parish, all 
of which excepting the parochial school, are supported by Socie- 
7\ u 1 o '""' supported by the Edinburgh Gae- 

lic School Society, and the fourth by the Inverness Education So- 
ciety 1 here are other two English schools soon to be opened at 
the districts of Valtos and Callernish. The ordinary branches of 
education are taught in the English schools, and the parochial 
teacher has the legal accommodations. Plis salary is L. 28, and 
his fees amount to about L. 5 a-year.

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are 50 persons receiving 
parochial aid in the parish. The yearly church collections are 
very inadequate, indeed, for meeting the exigencies of so many pau- 
pers, and there is no other fund for their support ; but several of 
them go about, seeking parochial relief; and. the whole of them 
are partly supported by their own relatives. 

Inns. — There is one inn in the parish. 

Fuel. — Peat moss is the fuel made use of here ; of which the peo- 
ple have abundance, and at very little expense. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The failure of the herring fishing in Loch Roag for thirty years 
back, has contributed to impoverish the people of this parish. The 
cultivation of the interior parts of the Lewis, wherever practicable, 
the letting of lands at a very low rent, and giving long leases to 
the occupiers, — would greatly improve the parish, and ameliorate 
the condition of the population, now settled everywhere on the sea 
shore. The country also requires some branches of roads to the 
interior, so as to cart lime from any of the harbours. Establishing 
a hemp or cotton manufactory in any part of the Lewis would do 
much for training a people who have so much idle time on hand, 
to habits of industry, and for ameliorating their condition. 

The happiness and comfort of the people would also be pro- 
moted were men of capital to engage in the fishing trade. It is a 
well known fact, that, of late, there were abundance of herring on 
the whole coast here, which remained for seven or eight weeks; 
but most of the inhabitants had no nets that could fish, so far 
out from shore. I am confident, that, had there been a num- 
ber of boats and vessels here upon the herring fishing, their suc- 
cess and profits would have been considerable.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF LEWIS, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. ROBERT FINLAYSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The parish of Lochs derives its name from the nume- 
rous arms of the sea, by which it is intersected, and the many fresh 
water lakes that intersperse its surface. 

It was the most recently inhabited parish in the Island of Lewis, 
according to the rapidly expiring traditions of the country ; the 
only source of information on this head to which we can resort. 
Different parts of it were used by the inhabitants of the parish of 
Uig, in times long gone by, as shealings, or summer pasturage for 
their cattle. There is a certain part of it that still retains the name 
of " Ari Dhhoil Chaim" or Donald Caum's sheahng. This Do- 
nald Caum was a noted character, who resided in the parish of Uig, 
in this island, seven generations ago. 

Extent. — The extreme length of the parish of Lochs, in a straight 
line, is 18 computed miles j not including the arms of the sea by 
which it is intersected. The breadth averages about nine miles. 
Its length is from north to south ; and its breadth of course from 
east to west. 

Boundaries.— The parish of Lochs is bounded on the south by 
an arm of the sea called Loch Seaforth, which separates it from 
Harris; on the south-west and west, by the hills of Harris and 
the parish of Uig, in a line which runs along the interior of the 
island, a distance of ten miles, over a very moorish tract of ground ; 
on the north, by the parish of Stornoway and the river Creed, which 
falls mto loch Stornoway ; and on the east, by the channel which 
separates the island of Lewis from the mainland of Ross-shire. 

Figure.— The parish of Lochs being intersected by many arms 
of the sea, is of a very irregular figure. A great part of it is a 
pemnsula called Park or the Forest of Lewis. This peninsula 

HebrtdT "  """ '■' indiscriminately termed Loclis i„ the 



158 



ROSS AND CROiMARTY. 



is called the Forest or Park, from its having been devoted by the 
first Earl of Seaforth to the exclusive maintenance of red-deer. 
Park forms the southern extremity of the parish. The arms of the 
sea by which it is formed into a peninsula are, Loch Seaforth and 
Loch Erisort. The isthmus that separates these lochs and joins 
the forest to the rest of the parish, is three quarters of a mile in 
breadth. 

When the forest of Lewis was devoted to the maintenance of 
red-deer, as noticed above, there was a very high dike across 
the isthmus ; but that dike can now be scarcely traced. The forest 
has been for many years let to tenants. 

Mountains. — The only mountains of any note in the parish of 
Lochs are in the district called Park. Some of these mountains 
are celebrated in the hunting -songs of Lewis men of bygone years ; 
among others " Benn Chrianeg, Ushinish, and Benn Mhore." 
These mountains are all in the southern division of Park. They 
are interspersed by valleys that yield good pasture, and are sepa- 
rated from the less mountainous part of Loch Shell. The rest of 
the parish, especially the interior, is almost all flat, yielding nothing 
but the coarsest of heath. 

Caves and Fissu-es. — The only cave in the parish of Lochs is in 
an island named Tauneray, which is situated in the entrance of 
Loch Erisort. This cave is about twelve by eight feet wide in its 
entrance ; its dimensions increase towards its centre, but terminate 
in a very limited space in its extremity, — which is so dark as to 
render a minute inspection inconvenient, especially as its entrance 
is washed at all times of the tide, by the sea- There are many fis- 
sures along the coast, which are not of importance to merit any 
special notice. 

Coast — The coast of Lochs is generally very bold and rocky, 
especially about the headlands. '1 he more inland parts of the 
coast are low, and yield a great quantity of sea-ware. The princi- 
pal headlands are Kilbag-head and Rhu-Rairnish. 

Temperature. — The climate is temperate, which is attributable to 
the insular situation of the country ; and though very damp, it is 
nevertheless very healthful, not only to natives, but also to stran- 
gers. Rainy weather prevails in Lewis, to a degree that is very 
prejudicial to the agricultural interest. 

Winds. — The prevailing winds are west and south-west, which 
are generally accompanied with rain. In the beginning of sum- 
mer, there is a succession of cold parching easterly winds generally, 



LEWIS LOCI-IS. 



159 



which prove very prejudicial to vegetation, and are otherwise per- 
nicious to cattle. 

Distempers. — The most prevalent distempers are rheumatism, 
severe colds, and occasional epidemical fevers, which sometimes 
prove fatal ; but that which is most decidedly peculiar to the island, 
is rheumatism. 

Hydrography — Friths. — The principal lochs or friths that inter- 
sect this parish, are Loch Seaforth, Loch Erisort, Loch Shell, and 
Loch Grimshadir, Of these, Loch Seafortli has the greatest claim to 
our notice, from its magnitude and picturesque scenery. It is about 
twelve miles long, bearing north-west from its entrance. The scenery 
around it, is truly majestic. Clishern, the highest hill in the Tong 
island, is close upon its south-west shores, while its north-east side 
washes the base of the principal hills of Park. It winds around 
many jutting points that form a variety of bays. Of these, we shall 
notice Mareg only. Here Loch Seaforth is land-locked, and pre- 
sents a scene of solitary magnificence unequalled in this neighbour- 
hood. About four miles farther up the loch, is a shoal that is im- 
passable by boats at half-tide, from its rapidity. It runs at the rate 
of eight miles an hour, and makes a noise with spring tides that can 
be heard in calm weather, at many miles distance. Loch Seaforth 
being environed by high land, and narrow throughout, has a very 
gloomy aspect. The scenery around it, is indeed solitary, and sel- 
dom frequented by man. The bleat of the sheep which pasture on 
the surrounding hills, sometimes breaks upon the ear. It is fre- 
quented by shipping ; but is not a very desirable anchorage, from 
the narrowness of its entry, and the loftiness of the surrounding 
land which causes the wind to swep the loch sometimes in sud- 
den gusts. 

Loch Erisort is next to Loch Seaforth, in magnitude. The 
entrance of this loch furnishes many excellent anchorages for ship- 
ping of any burthen. It is much frequented, and is by seafaring 
men named the Barkin Isles, from a cluster of islands which are 
situated in its entrance. 

iaes.— There are many fresh water lakes in the parish of 
Lochs, varyinginextentfromamile and a-half downwards. Of these, 
we shall only notice Loch Trialivall. The water of this lake is 
more transparent than that of any other lake in the parish. This 
lake has a sandy bottom ; but almost all the rest are mossy in their 
bottom, which darkens their water. There are a few mineral 
sprmgs interspersed throughout the country.

Rivers. — There is not a river of any magnitude in all tlie parish 
of Lochs, excepting the river Creed, which separates the parish 
of Lochs from the parish of Stornoway. The largest river in the 
parish is that of Laxay; it runs out of Loch Trialivall, already 
noticed, — which loch is fed by Loch Adigo, in the parish of Uig. 
This river is 3 miles long and about 30 feet broad, and is generally 
about 15 inches deep. The other numerous streams are so trifling 
as not to merit notice. 

Geology. — The parish of Lochs presents a very rocky aspect 
everywhere, except in the interior, where it is soft and mossy, 
and where the number of lakes cannot fail to excite the stranger's 
astonishment. Indeed, so much fresh water on so small an extent 
of ground, is not elsewhere to be seen in the British dominions. 

Soil. — The soil is uniformly mossy, reduced in some places, by 
dint of industry, to a state of indifferent cultivation. It is generally 
black, composed of decayed vegetable matter, with an occasional 
mixture of gravel. The depth of the soil varies very much. It is 
generally thin in the spots reduced to cultivation, which renders it 
necessary for the agriculturist to gather it together, leaving a 
wide space of bare stones between every crooked ridge. The moss 
is ten feet deep in some places, and is rapidly increasing. Its pro- 
duct being the coarsest of heath is not grateful food for cattle ; it 
therefore decays annually, covering the spot from which it springs 
with a thin stratum, that progressively increases the moss on which 
it grows. 

Zoology. — The Island of Lewis abounds with sheep, black-cattle, 
horses and red-deer ; all of which are of a vei-y diminutive size, in 
consequence of the rough unsubstantial heath which constitutes 
the chief part of their food. When the Lewis cattle are brought 
to better pasturage in the south, they improve astonishingly ; and, 
from their hardy nature, they suffer less in driving than any other 
cattle in the north. The native sheep are very similar to the breed 
peculiar to North Wales. Their wool is finer ; but that breed is 
nearly extirpated, and the common black-faced and Cheviot breeds 
have been introduced into the island, by Dr Macaulay of Linshadir 
and Mr Stewart of Valimas, — the only capitalists who have done 
much to improve the breed of sheep and cattle in the Lewis. 

Game is not very abundant in the Lewis. There are no rab- 
bits nor roes. There are a few hares, which are, in common with 
all the quadrupeds here, diminutive in size. In the feathered tribes, 



LEWIS — LOCHS. IGl 

game is more abundant, with the exception of partridges and 
pheasants, of which there are none. 

All the insects peculiar to this climate, are abundant in the 
Lewis. Caterpillars have been, of late years, particularly so,— as 
is also that noxious insect, the grub-worm. 

Every kind of fish which is to be met in the northern seas, fre- 
quents the Lewis coast. There were great takings of herring in 
some lochs in this island, in past years, particularly in Loch Roag; 
but the herring fishing has not been prosperous, of late years. 
Herrings frequent the Lewis coast, in great shoals, every Septem- 
ber.- They seem in perpetual progress towards the east. It is sel- 
dom that a few stragglers from the main body visits the lochs in 
which they formerly so much abounded. The desertion of the 
Lewis lochs by the herrings, is attributed by some to the constant 
reapmg yearly of the sea-weed or weir along the coast. Whatever 
truth may be in this opinion, it is certain that the decrease of the 
quantity of herrings taken in the Lewis has kept pace with the in- 
crease of the quantity of kelp manufactured on the island. Cod 
and hng are taken in considerable abundance. But the quantity of 
them taken, is not equal to that taken in former years,— notwith- 
standing of the improvement which has taken place in the fishing 
materials, and the great increase of fishermen. At present, there 
are about sixty tons taken annually in the parish of Lochs. 

The fresh water lakes of Lewis abound with black trout, all 
of one kind, but differing in size and quality, in different lakes. 
Carp are to be met with here, but rarely. The only river in 
the parish of Lochs, which produces salmon, is the river of Laxay 
The river Creed, which separates the parish of Lochs from the 
parish of Stornoway, produces a few salmon also; but they are 
not so abundant, nor so good in quality on the river Creed, as in 
the river of Laxay. The proper season for fishing this river 
commences in November, and continues until July. The fish 
taken m the early part of the season, are always the best. I have 
been induced to believe, by the testimony of several respectable 
people in this island, who have had ample opportunities of knowing, 
that salmon spawn every second year only. It is perfectly well 
known here, that while the salmon which spawned are poor and 
black in the months of November, December, January, February, 
and March, during these months other salmon come from the 
sea, tat and fresh ; and that the winter is the best season for fish- 
'"«co° "" ''eater abundance during that

season of the year, but thai what is taken then is much better than 
what is taken, during what is called generally the fishing season. 

Shell-fish is less abundant on the shores' of the parish ol" 
Lochs, than on the shores of other parishes in Lewis. There 
are a few lobsters in their season, about the headlands. Mussels 
are plentiful in some of the bays, where there are also a few oys- 
ters. There is a variety of whelks and other shell-fish of minor 
importance. 

Botany. — The parish of Lochs furnishes but a very stinted field 
for botanical observation. It is almost all covered with heath. The 
exceptions are a few spots along the sea shore, which were ren- 
dered green by cultivation, and are now left in crooked ridges, as 
not compensating the labours of the husbandman. 

There is a stinted scraggy copsewood of birch of small extent, 
in a point of this parish called Swordle, near the spot on which 
the first manse in this parish stood. This is the only wood now 
on the island ; but the Lewis was at one time covered with wood 
of great size and variety, as is evident from the huge roots which 
are yet abundant in all parts of the island. Tradition says that the 
woods of Lewis were burnt by the Danes. 

II. — Civil History. 
Ancient History. — There is no account, either printed or inmanu- 
script, of the ancient history of the parish of Lochs, excepting 
what may be in the possession of Mr R. Macaulay, preacher of the 
gospel, Stornoway, who, I am informed, proposed to collect the tra- 
ditions of Lewis, with a view to publication. 

Traditions. — The traditions of this country present a crude 
mass of events, which refer more to the occasional exploits of the 
heroes of the Shenachies, than to the regular history of the Lewis. 
These traditions are nevertheless very interesting; but there is 
scarcely any of importance that refers to this particular parish of 
Lochs. The bards or shenachies of Lewis resided in the parishes 
of Uig and Barvas or Ness, as did also their favourite heroes. 

Land-oioners. — The sole land-owner of this parish, and of all 
the Island of Lewis, is James Alexander Stewart M'Kenzie, Esq. 
M. P., who succeeded to the estate, on his marriage to the Ho- 
nourable Lady Hood M'Kenzie, widow of the late Admiral Sir Sa- 
muel Hood, and eldest daughter of the last Lord Seaforth. 

Parish Registers. — No register was kept in this parish at any 
time, as far as known, until July 1831, when the present incumbent 
became parish minister of Lochs.

Antiquities.~T\\e principal antiquity in the pansh of Lochs is 
in that district called Carloway, which is situated on the north- 
west side of Lewis, separating the parishes of Uig and Barvas. 
Ihis antiquity is a fortification of circular form. It was and is 
still covered with turf, and lined with a remarkably strong stone 
wall, which IS, however, suffering decay. The lower part of the 
interior of this edifice was a place of residence, to which there was a 
subterraneous passage from an adjacent hill or brae. There was 
also an interior wall of stone, inclosing the more elevated habitable 
part of the edifice ; between which and the outer wall, there was a 
winding flight of stone steps from the top to the bottom,-over 
which, there was a parapet four feet high. The interior of this for- 
tification or doon, as it is named in Gaelic is now in a state of 
dilapidation. Its height when entire was about twenty feet. It was 
of that class of buildings well known in Ireland by the name of 
round towers, of which many were built there by the Danes, who 
also are said m the traditions of Lewis to have built " Dun Char- 
loway." This fortification must have been a place of considerable 
strength, when the javehn, the bow and arrow were the only imple- 
ments of war. Tradition says, Dun Charioway was once taken by 
an individual notorious in the traditions of Lewis, named « Donald 
Caum M'Cuil," who, by means of two dirks which he constantly 
carried about with him, one of which he alternately stuck in the 
turf that covers the outer stone dike of Dun Charioway, raised 
himself up to the summit of the parapet, from which the inmates 
were wont to shoot their arrows at the assailing foe. Donald 
Caum, once m possession of the parapet, made the sleepino- in- 
mates easy victims to his resentment, during the darkness of night. 

There are several ruins of fortifications of minor magnitude, but 
ot a similar description, throughout this island. The only other in 
this parish, lies on a rock surrounded by the sea, at the entrance of 
i-iocn Lrisort. 

There is a ruin on the island of St Colm, in the entrance of 
Loch Erisort, which was once a religious edifice. The ground 
surrounding this ruin, is the only place of interment in the parish of 
Lochs St Colm IS the place on which the first factor sent to the 
Lewis by the M'Kenzies, then of Kintail, resided. It is the ge- 
neral opinion, that the said ruin on the island of St Colm is the 

Ml t . '""''''P' '"" " dy o'' " Mac Mhic 

vihoruchi which was the patronymic of the first factor sent to 
this island by the M'Kenzies.

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



. Manse, Sfc. — The manse of Lochs stands on an eminence, on the 
north side of Loch Erisort. It is a commodious house, but very 
much exposed to the inclemency of the weather. It was built up- 
wards of thirty years ago, and is, with the exception of the farm 
house of the Valimas, the only house in the parish of Lochs, which 
is built of stone and lime. There are three dwelling-houses in 
the parish built of stone and clay, which are occupied by farmers, 
and are comfortable considering their size, — of which only one 
is slated, viz. the inn of Lochshell, which is the'only inn in the pa- 
rish ; it is a farm house also. The other habitations are wretched. 
They are built of stones and moss ; but mostly of moss. Their 
walls, if they can be so called, are generally four feet high» 
and from four to five feet thick. They are thatched with barley 
stubble. They are all built on declivities. Their upper ends are 
occupied by the families, and their lower ends by their cattle, with- 
out any partition or division between them. 

Mills. — The mills in Lewis are probably the greatest curiosity 
a stranger can meet with on the island. There is scarcely a 
stream along the .coast, on any part of the island, on which a 
mill is not to be seen. These mills are of very small size, 
and of a very simple construction. The water passes through 
their middle, where the wheel, — a solid piece of wood generally, 
eighteen inches in diameter, — stands perpendicularly. A bar-of 
iron runs through the centre of this wheel. This bar of iron or axle 
rests on a piece of steel, which is fixed on a plank, the one end 
of which is fixed in the mill wall, the other in the end of a piece 
of plank, which stands at right angles with the plank on which the 
wheel rests.- The upper end of the axle fits into a cross bar of 
iron, which is fitted into the upper millstone, the axle passing 
through the centre of the lower millstone, which is rested upon 
wooden beams or long stones. There is a purchase upon the end 
of the said perpendicular beam or plank, by which the upper mill- 
stone can be raised or lowered. There are nine pieces of board, 
eight inches broad, and a foot and a-half long, fixed in the wheel, 
parallel and at equal distances from each other, upon which the 
water is brought to bear ; which, together with a few sticks for roof, 
and some heather for thatch, constitutes a Lewis mill.

LEWIS LOCHS. 165 

Habits, Language, Src. of the People.— They are generally sober, 
bospitable, industrious, and capable of enduring much fatigue. 

The common food of the people is potatoes, bear meal bannocks, 
pottage made of black oat-meal, milk and fish occasionally. 

The games prevalent here were jumping, putting the stone, the 
shinty or club ; but these are now gone out of use. 

Poaching in game is not known here ; but there is poaching 
a more pernicious kind practised, which, though recently checked, 
is not quite abolished, viz. catching fresh water fish with a kind of 
pock-net, in rivulets and rivers, in the spawning season. 

The people of Lochs are intelligent considering their opportu- 
nities. They are quiet, tractable, and very hospitable, sensible of 
their ignorance, and eager to be instructed in temporal as well as 
spiritual matters. It would be desirable, however, that they paid 
more attention to cleanliness. It cannot be expected, indeed, that 
a people shut out from intercourse with the civihzed world should 
be so polished as others who have better opportunities of improve- 
ment; but their general good behaviour is such as might put many 
of these more favoured individuals to the blush.

Agriculture. —

are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, from . 2000 to WO 

Number of acres which never have been cultivated, and which 

remam constantly waste, or in pasture, probably from . 150,000 to 100 000 

Only a few acres are under natural wood. 

• 

Manufactires.— The only article manufactured in the parish of 
Lochs for exportation, is kelp,— of which upwards of 100 tons are 
exported annually. There are many articles manufactured here, 
for home consumption ; such as blankets for beds, coarse cloth' 
various in quality and colour, but chiefly striped, stockings, &amp;c' 
The poor people generally rear the wool from which they manu- 
facture their scanty store of these necessaries; but there are some 
of them the poorest, who have no sheep, and are therefore com- 
pelled to buy wool from their more highly favoured neighbours 
—which, however, they are in many instances unable to do to the 
extent their necessities would require. 

Mechanics.— The only resident tradesmen in Lochs are, boat- 
builders, weavers, and tailors. Almost all the labouring part of 
the population, male and female, are acquainted with the manu- 
facturing of kelp. All the males fit to endure the fatigue are oc 

pr'ci Jfy. "" ° estimating these quantities more

casionally accustomed to fishing ; and all the females are accustom- 
ed to spin yarn, principally with the spindle and distaff, and also 
to make stockings. 

There are no lands in the parish of Lochs, that can properly be 
called arable. The plough is not used at all. The people rear their 
crops on small detached spots, and cultivate the ground with spades. 
That notorious implement of Scottish Highland husbandry, " the 
crooked spade," is much used in this parish. There is not a suf- 
ficiency of food produced in the parish, to support its inhabitants. 
The wants of the inhabitants in this respect can always be relieved 
at Stornoway, — where stores of every necessary are always kept by 
the respectable part of the mercantile community. Indeed the soil, 
but more especially the climate is not favourable for agriculture ; 
yet, by giving due encouragement to industrious capitalists, in 
granting them long leases, and the land at a moderate valuation, 
the country would be greatly improved. The parish would yield 
a sufficiency of provision for its inhabitants y the money sent out of 
the island for provisions would be kept at home ; and, instead of the 
people devoting their time indiscriminately to the mixed avocations of 
husbandry, fishing, kelp-making, grazing, &amp;c. each should have his 
distinct and separate avocation, — which, I am persuaded, would 
greatly conduce to the general welfare of the community. The 
poor people are glad, at present, to have a spot of ground, at whatever 
price, to ensure some food for the ensuing year ; but while their 
attention is divided, as we already noticed, they can bestow on no 
part of their avocation that attention which, under other circum- 
stances, would ensure success. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Fost and Market-Town. — There is no post or market-town in 
the parish of Lochs: the nearest to it is Stornoway, which is eleven 
miles from the church of liOchs. The only post-office in the is- 
land of Lewis is in Stornoway, from whence there is a mail packet 
once a week weather permitting to Poolewe, on the mainland of 
Ross-shire. 

Boads, 8fc. — There is not a road of any description in any part of 
the parish of Lochs. Every communication with the next market- 
town, must be over the trackless heath or by sea. A line of road 
was commenced at Stornoway in 1830, which is intended to 
be extended as far as Harris, passing through the parish of Lochs ; 
but that road has not as yet been extended beyond the limits of the 
parish of Stornoway. 



LEWIS — 1,0CHS. 



167 



There are many good harbours in the parisli of Lochs, the 
principal of which are, Cromore, which is in the entrance of 
Loch Erisort, Lochshell, and Marig, in Loch Seaforth. These 
harbours are sufficient to accommodate shipping of any burthen. 
Their depth is from fifty feet downwards. 

Villages. — The inhabitants of the parish of Lochs reside in de - 
tached villages, having a population varying from 40 families down- 
wards. The most of these villages or farms are lotted in dif- 
ferent divisions, each tenant having his house on his own lot, and 
contracting with his landlord separately for his yearly rent, so that 
the tenants living on the same farm hold their lands independent- 
ly of each other. Some of them have their tenements placed 
more promiscuously. These divide their spots of corn land as 
they are detached upon the farm, giving each other a proportion 
according to their respective rents ; and that each may have his 
just share of the benefits of the pasture also, they restrict each 
other to a proportion of cattle corresponding with the amount of 
their rents : thus securing to each other, by mutual consent, a share 
of the produce of their form, proportionate to their respective rents. 

Church. — The parish church is situate on a small peninsula, 
on the farm of Keose. Its situation is centrical ; but the arms of 
the sea, by which the parish is intersected, render a regular at- 
tendance on divine service impracticable during the winter. 
There is a part of the parish situated on the north-west side of 
the island, between the parishes of Uig and Barvas, a distance of 
eighteen miles from the parish church of Lochs, where the mi- 
nister of Lochs is bound to preach once every three months. 
This district is named Carloway, and stands more in need of the 
labours of a missionary than any other place in the Long- Island. 
The inhabitants of Carloway have no opportunity of attending di- 
vine service, except when the minister of Lochs preaches there. 
The population of Carloway is 90 L The stipend, converted to 
money, amounts to L. 160. The manse was lately put in good re- 
pair. I cannot state precisely either the extent or value of the glebe. 
The parish church is a new building, sufficient to accommodate 
700 sitters. Public worship is well attended, excepting when the 
violence of the weather detains such of the parishioners as must 
have recourse to boating, in coming to church. There is not a Go- 
vernment church, nor any place of public worship in the parish of 
Lochs, excepting the parish church. There is not a single dis- 
senter from the Established Church in any part of the Lewis Is- 



168 



ROSS AND CllOMAKTV. 



iand. Preachers from dissenting Associations have laboured among 
the people of Lewis for many years ; but they all failed to unite 
a single individual to their own society. About 530 families at- 
tend the Established Church. 

Education. — The remoteness of some parts of the parish of 
Lochs from the parish school, renders it impossible for the greater 
part of the rising generation, to avail themselves of the means of a 
liberal education. To have the means of education disseminated 
to an extent adequate to the necessities of the people, three other 
schools are requisite. This is owing principally to the physical 
character of the parish, the habitable parts of which are separated 
from each other by arms of the sea, and by extensive tracts of waste 
ground. The parish schoolmaster's salary is L. 28, and his fees 
do not exceed L. 1, 10s. a year. 

There are only 12 persons in all the parish who can write ; but 
half the inhabitants fi'om twelve to twenty-four years of age can 
read the Gaelic language, which is the only language spoken 
generally. A few of the males can speak broken English. It was 
by the instrumentality of the Gaelic School Society that so many 
of them were enabled to read Gaelic. 

The Gaelic School Society has four schools at present in the 
parish of Lochs, which are the only schools in it. The parish 
school has been vacant for many years, from the want of accommo- 
dation, — which has been much against the inhabitants, who seem 
to hold the benefits of education in very high estimation ; but that 
grievance has been removed. A commodious school-house has 
been erected recently, and a teacher appointed. 

Poor. — The only charitable contributions in this parish are 
raised at the church after divine service. The amount of these 
contributions is generally low, in consequence of the poverty of the 
people ; but the poor of the parish are supported chiefly by their 
relations. Such of them as are destitute of near relations, find 
willing friends in their neighbours and acquaintances to administer 
to their necessities. The number of paupers in the parish has not 
as yet been actually ascertained. 

Jail — Alehouse. — There is no jail in the parish of Lochs. The 
next to it, is that of Stornoway. There is only one inn, viz. that 
of Lochshell, which is frequented by seafaring men only. 

Fuel. — The fuel used here universally is peats, which are of ex- 
cellent quality, and in very great abundance. This fuel is not on- 
.ly abundant but convenient also ; for the peat banks, or the moss

from which they prepare this fuel, is, in many instances, no more 
than fifty feet from the dweUing houses of the people ; though, in a 
few other instances, it is a full mile distant. The labour of pre- 
paring this fuel chiefly devolves on the female part of the popula- 
tion, with the single exception of cutting the peats out of the moss, 
and spreading them on the ground to dry, which is done by the 
males. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The condition of the people of Lochs differs materially from 
what it was, when the last Statistical Account was published. 
Then, very few of them could read ; but now, the half of them, from 
the ages of ten to thirty years, can read the Scriptures in their mo- 
ther tongue. This happy change has been brought about, by means 
of the Gaelic School Society. Indeed, the proprietor and proprie- 
tress of this island are very energetic in disseminating a know- 
ledge of the oracles of truth among their poor tenants. But, from 
a change in the times, and other circumstances, the poor people 
are much reduced in circumstances. The fishing, which formerly 
constituted a chief part of their support, has not been prosperous 
of late years; but the mainspring of their prosperity was the price 
of cattle, which has also failed. This, together with , the warm 
entreaties of their acquaintances and friends who emigrated to 
Nova Scotia in former years, seems to have inspired them with 
the spirit of emigration; and nothing but reluctance to part with 
their scanty stocks of cattle, at the present very low prices, seems 
to retard the emigration of a great many of the people of Lochs 
this year, to British North America.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHCARRON, SYNOD OF GLENELG. 

THE REV. JAMES MORISON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Namci Situation, Sfc. — The parish of Kintail is situate on the 
west coast of the county of Ross, and chiefly along the north shore 
of Lochduich. The name is evidently of Gaelic derivation, and 
signifies {Cean da shaill head of two seas. An arm of the At- 
lantic at Kyle-akin extends eastwardly for about eight miles, until it 
meets the first point of land in Kintail, at the island of Donnan. 
At this island, the sea divides itself in such a manner, that about 
two-thirds take a south-east direction for six miles, terminating in 
what is properly called Lochduich, one of the most beautiful and 
romantic sheets of water in the West Highlands. The other divi- 
sion, called Lochlong, extends in a north-north-east direction for 
about 4 miles. In no part, is Lochlong more than a quarter of a 
mile broad. Its tides are always rapid, and at times almost irre- 
sistible. Lochlong separates this district of Kintail from the pa- 
rish of Lochalsh ; but there is a well regulated ferry, affording an 
easy and safe access from the one parish to the other. Between 
the north-east end of Lochlong and the south-east end of Loch- 
duich, is included the inhabited portion of the parish. 

Extent, 8fc. — It is impossible to say exactly what the extent of 
the parish may be, as it never was accurately measured ; but, ac- 
cording to the opinions of those best acquainted with the grounds, 
it cannot be more than from 18 to 20 miles from east to west, — 
and of this extent 10 miles only are inhabited; the rest, con- 
sisting of hill-grazings, is admirably fitted for the pasturing of all 
kinds of stock. The parish is from 5 to 6 miles broad ; but all the 
hamlets and cultivated land are, with few exceptions, along the sea 
shore. The northern district of the parish, called Glenelchaig, is 
separated from the southern and western division along Lochduich 
and Lochlong, by high and rugged mountains ; and is by no means 
of easy access. 



KINTAIL.

Topographical Appearances. — Kintail is, in all directions, sur- 
rounded with high hills. Few districts are more admirably pro- 
tected, or more strongly fortified by the natural bulwarks of moun- 
tain ranges, than the barony of Kintail. Access to it, of old, was 
an arduous undertaking, — the country being entirely without 
roads, and the principal approaches being through extremely nar- 
row glens, where a few individuals might defend the country against 
an invading army of many hundreds. This may truly be said of 
the pass of Bealach, in this parish. That pass is not many feet 
broad, and is flanked on both sides with perpendicular rocks of 
very considerable altitude, apparently overhanging their base. It 
is a spot of extreme wildness, and seldom does the traveller realize 
the feeling of loneliness with greater power than in the Bealach. 
Such as are pleased with scenery of this description, would do well 
to visit the Bealach. From whatever quarter Kintail is entered, 
whether by sea from the west, or by land from the east, a scene 
gradually unfolds itself, which it is impossible to describe. Moun- 
tains of immense magnitude, grouped together in the sublimest 
manner, with wood and water, scars and bens intermingled, present 
a prospect seldom surpassed in wild beauty, and equally interest- 
ing and astonishing in the storms of winter, and in the calm se- 
renity of summer. 

Among the mountains, which more properly belong to this pa- 
rish, Tuliochard holds a conspicuous place, and merits a special 
notice. It stands the undisputed monarch of the mountains on the 
north side of Lochduich. Legendary traditions represent it as an- 
ciently held in high veneration ; but this feeling, if it really ever 
existed, is now totally extinct. It commands a pretty extensive 
view of many of the western isles, and is by no means difficult of 
ascent. Its height has not been ascertained.  There are other 
mountains in the parish of great altitude, and of picturesque ap- 
pearance, — such as Glasbhein, Soccachraaam-an-Tuirc, and Ben- 
Ulay. 

It might naturally be expected that a district so alpine as Kintail 
would abound with caves and caverns. The contrary is the fact 
there are only two caves, and these of an extent too trifling to 
merit particular attention. Neither are there any caves on the sea 
coast. 

Although a considerable proportion of our coast is rocky, yet it 
presents no novelty deserving of notice. The general character of 

" Tullocliaid is tlie Burning Mount of tlie ScaforUi crest.

Meteorology -The temperature of the atmosphere, compared 
with that of the east coast, is mild and pleasant; and although, 
generally speaking, the climate may be termed damp, it is un- 
commonly salubrious. Very few distempers of a virulent nature 
appear m the country. Rheumatism and complaints arising from 
damp and hard labour, greatly prevail. The natives live to a good 
old age. The season of the greatest mortality is from December 
to March; and although all the parishioners of Glensheil and of 
Kintad, with very few exceptions, and a vast number of the pa- 
rishioners of Lochalsh, inter their dead in the buryino-.ground of 
this parish, it has been remarked that, at other seasons' for weeks, 
indeed for three or four months, there was not an interment in the 
district. 

H7jdrography.~The parish of Kintail abounds with the finest 
fresh water springs, chiefly perennial. Some of these afford the 
most abundant supplies of water. The united streams of three of 
them supply water sufficient for the use of the parish mill, through- 
out the year. During the most prolonged draught of summer, this 
mill has not been known to want sufficient supplies of water. The 
water issuing from these springs, has no particular colour to indi- 
cate the presence of any mineral. The natives, in some instances, 
resort to one particular well, deeming its waters to possess sanative 
qualities : but, in taste or appearance, it differs not from its thousand 
neighbours. 

The lochs belonging to this parish are few, and of no great ex- 
tent. The largest are Loch-a-Bhealich and Loch Glassletter, 
abounding with trout of the finest quality, aff'ording delightful sport 
to the angler. They have never been sounded; but their depth is 
supposed to be considerable. 

The rivers which merit special notice are, the Croe, separating 
the parishes of Kintail and Glensheil ; the Loing, separating Kin- 
tail from Lochalsh; and the Elchaig. The Elchaig and Loing 
empty themselves into Lochlong, and the Croe into Lochduich at 
its eastern extremity. They run but a short course, and from the 
great number of mountain streams which fall into them, are quick- 
ly flooded. These rivers at one time were much frequented by 
salmon, and the fishing was held as common property by the people. 
This was more especially the case with the river Croe. The sal- 
mon is now by no means so abundant. The Lochduich and Croe

salmon-fishings are annually let to strangers from the east coast, 
who generally send the fish to the London market. It is difficult, 
perhaps impossible,, to say, why the salmon has deserted these 
streams so much. Various causes have been assigned, but none of 
them satisfactorily accounts for the fact. The idea which most com- 
monly prevails in the country is, that salmon, naturally fond of 
clear sweet water, resorted to these rivers while they possessed 
these qualities, as they unquestionably did in a greater degree 
than they now can be said to do, while black cattle continued to 
be the staple stock of the country; but since the introduction of 
sheep, and the habit of washing them in the rivers, and pasturing 
them on the banks, has obtained, the waters have become more im- 
pure and less relished, and consequently not so much frequented 
by the salmon. The spawning season commences in the month of 
October; and the fish commonly return to the sea about the months 
of February and March. 

The Waterfall of Glomach. — In this parish, there is -one of 
the highest and finest waterfalls in the kingdom, well known in 
the district by its appropriate name, Glomach. It is situate in a 
remote and uninhabited valley on the estate of Mr M'Kenzie of 
Applecross, and about seven, miles from the inn of Shealhouse. 
It merits a special notice in a national work of this kind, and will 
most amply reward any fatigue the traveller may undergo in ap- 
proaching it from the plains. Its height, lately ascertained without 
instruments as accurately as the nature of the ground admitted of, 
is 350 feet. At the distance of about 50 feet from the bottom, 
the water meets with a slight interruption from a shelving projec- 
tion in the rock. This, however, adds to, rather than subtracts 
from, the peculiar interest and grandeur of the scene,— forming a 
kmd of resting-place for the eye in surveying this stupendous fall, 
and giving occasion to an increased volume of spray, which must 
ever contribute to the imposing appearance of such scenes. There 
is, however, independent of this break, at any season, and in any 
weather, a mighty fall of 300 feet. But the interruption alluded 
to is not at all perceptible, when there is any great body of water 
in the river Girsac; and on such occasions the fall is unbroken, 
terrific, and sublime. The best view is obtained from a solitary tree' 
about a hundred feet down the ravine, to the south-west of the fall,' 
in a situation the most favourable possible for getting a complete 
view of the whole scene ;— for here, a narrow neck of rock, covered 
with long heath, stretches forward towards the water, enabling the

Visitor to occupy a station in the very centre of the tremendous ob- 
jects by which he is surrounded. As there is no path, the tourist 
will at once perceive the necessity of using much caution in descend- 
ing to this spot. On looking around him, he finds the range of his 
vision fearfully limited, by objects vast and immense, concentrated 
in fearful magnificence before him, and in almost alarming proximity 
to him. He is apt, however, to consider his situation more danger- 
ous than it really is. From the tree, the scene is extremely grand. 
The water appears to issue from an oblong fissure in the rock, from 
whence, with a fearful rush, it dashes its way, chiefly in one great 
column, to the pool below, from which at this station no outlet can be 
perceived. The immediate neighbourhood of the fall is amazingly 
wild and barren. In this respect, it differs essentially from its neigh- 
bour at Foyers. Here and there may be seen a tuft of grass, or per- 
haps of breckons, a mountain saxifrage, clinging to great naked 
sheets of perpendicular rocks, and adding, if possible, to the gene- 
ral grandeur of the scene. 

Geoloffy.— The prevailing rock in this parish is gneiss, contain- 
ing occasionally intersecting veins, also beds, and bodies of granite 
and syenite. 

Botany. — Kintail affords ample study to the botanist. The ordi- 
nary plants grow profusely, and flower richly,— although it must be 
admitted, that the humidity of the climate obviously affects the per- 
fection and beauty of many of them. From this circumstance, it is 
most difficult to preserve plants in this country ; and although every 
precaution was used to prepare a Hortus Siccus, according to the 
method recommended by Sir J. E. Smith, of such plants as are in- 
digenous to the district, — yet, after the lapse of two years, they be- 
came quite useless and unfit for subsequent examination. No rare 
plant seems to be produced in this country; and it would occu- 
py more space than can be well afforded, to give a minute classifica- 
tion of such as are indigenous to the parish. The following may 
be mentioned ; but the list is by no means complete.

The climate, notwithstanding its dampness, appears to be most 
favourable to the growth of plants and forest trees, — all the sorts 
hitherto introduced having attained great perfection. The plant- 
ings are, by no means, extensive in this parish, but are most 
thriving. Larch, spruce, and Scotch firs grow rapidly; as do 
all the common forest trees, oak, ash, elm, birch. Many hot- 
house plants attain very great perfection and size, in the open air. 
There is, in particular, a hydrangia, in the parish, of uncommon 
dimensions in these northern climates. Its height is nearly 8 feet, 
circumference 31 feet 3 inches. Some of its flowers measure 17- 
inches in circumference, and its annual average of flowers is about 
300. 

Zoology. — It might be expected that, in a country so mountain- 
ous, a great variety of animals would be found. The case is very 
much the contrary. There is nothing rare or uncommon in this 
department. The fox, badger, polecat, martin, and weasel, are 
numerous ; hare and roe seldom seen, and deer are not nearly so 
numerous as many of the older inhabitants remember them to have 
been. The reason of this is obvious ; the grazing on which the 
deer, in former times, pastured, is now stocked with sheep, and be- 
ing continually annoyed by shepherds' dogs, &amp;c. they have for- 
saken their old haunts. The boar and welfare said to have once 
existed in the district ; but if ever this was the case they have been 
for generations extinct. The eagle, raven, and a great variety of 
the hawk genus, are common. Plover, in large covies, are frequent- 
ly met with. Grouse not being at all preserved are not numerous; 
and the heath being nearly burnt for the better pasturing of sheep, 
they are at once deprived of cover and sustenance. 

In a country where the rights of hunting and fishing were, till 
lately, held common, it is difficult to convince the people they 
are doing wrong, in killing fish or shooting deer. And they re- 



176 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



gard the prohibition more as a whim of the lairds, than as the 
effect of legal enactment. 

Poaching may exist, but it does not prevail. Now and then, a 
kilted stripling, finding it no longer possible to restrain the ardour 
of youth, takes up his grandsire's rifle  and betakes himself, in com- 
pany with some faithful friend, to the mountains, and seldom re- 
turns unburdened. But such acts as these are not of frequent oc- 
currence ; and the proprietors have not hitherto, in any instance, 
prosecuted for trespass under the game laws. 

II. — Civil Histouy. 

Jntiquities. — In the immediate vicinity of the village of Dornie, 
stand the ruins of the castle Donnan. It is generally believed to 
have been built, about the time of Alexander III. of Scotland ; for 
it was by him presented, immediately after the battle of Largs, to 
Colin Fitzgerald, for his distinguished services in the Royal cause 
" by sea and land." The castle has been for ages in ruins, and al- 
though now greatly dilapidated, a finer or more picturesque ruin 
can seldom be met with. Its situation was judiciously chosen ; 
and the scenery by which it is surrounded is of the most imposing 
description. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners of the parish are, Mr M'Ken- 
zie, of Applecross and Inverinate, W. S. ; and the Chisholm ; and 
the estate of the late Sir Hugh Innes, lying in Kintail, is now under 
the management of trustees. 

Parochial Registers.— The parish registers are all of modern 
date. The earliest entry is in 1787. They are by no means vo- 
luminous, and are now regularly kept.

Any increase of population which has taken place within the 
last twenty years, may be chiefly ascribed to the system of appor- 
tioning lands in lots of one and two acres, and half an acre ; and 
such as are not able to take a large farm, readily engage to pay 
from L. 4 to L. 8 for such lots,— upon which, with the help of the 
herring-fishing, they endeavour to lead, what, with regard to many

of them, maybe termed a miserable existence. Notwithstanding this 
state of things, emigration does not prevail. Very few, not above 
six families, have left the parish for any foreign country, for many 
years. The love of country prevails most strongly ; and they never 
think of emigration, until, from poverty, they are unable to pay their 
passage, and, under these circumstances, emigration is out of the 
question.

There is no case of confirmed insanity in the parish. There 
are 7 idiots ; 3 afflicted with blindness ; 2 deaf and dumb, one of 
whom was educated in the Edinburgh Institution. 

Language of the People.— GdieWc is the language of the country, 
and, with the exception of a few provincial expressions, is spoken 
with remarkable purity and correctness. The people are better 
educated than formerly, and almost all the young people speak 
and read a little English ; yet it cannot be said that Gaelic has 
lost ground, or that in conversation, business, or in any other re- 
spect, it has been superseded by English. 

Cliaracter of the People.— In every country, however orderly and 
well-behaving the natives may be, and however strictly parochial 
discipline may be administered, there is always much to reform 
and many things to censure; but, in justice to the parishioners of 
Kmtail, it must be said, that from the earliest history of the country, • 
they have been distinguished for general good conduct. In a po- 
pulation of 1240 souls, there is only one drunkard. There is no 
such character as a thief, and seldom, indeed, does a case of petty 
larceny occur. There never was, in the memory of man, an in- 
dividual executed or banished the country, for crime. 

. IV. — Industry. 

This IS chiefly a pastoral parish ; and it does not appear of im- 
portance to ascertain the quantity of ground in tillage, or to make 
any remarks on the mode of cultivation. The larger farms ai'e 
m the natural possession of the proprietors, and are managed on 
the most approved system of husbandry. Little attention com- 
paratively is paid to the arable land ; regard is almost exclusively 
directed to the sheep stock, which has of late years been ffreatlv

improved, in consequence of crossing as it is termed from the 
old black-faced stock to the Cheviot,— which has been attended 
with the happiest results, as sheep from this parish and neighbour- 
hood, generally fetch the first prices, at the southern markets. 

Along the north-east shore of Lochlong, there are two fishmg 
villages, Dornie and Bundalloch. They are densely peopled ; 
but, with the exception of Dornie, where there are a few good 
houses, there is nothing which merits any special notice about them. 
V. — Parochial Economy, 
There is no market of any kind established in the parish, 
the nearest market-towns being Dingwall and Inverness ; but, the 
greater part of the year, steam-boats plying from Glasgow to Skye, 
and passing through the inner sounds of Kyles Ehea and Achm, 
afford the greatest convenience to the country; and almost all the re- 
spectable inhabitants are provided, in this manner, with all the ar- 
ticles of home consumption. 

There is no post-office in the parish ; but mails are received and 
dispatched, three times a-week, in the adjoining parish of Lochalsh, 
from which, as often, letters are forwarded by post-runners to 
Kintail, Glensheil, and Glenelg. A Parliamentary road passes 
through the parish, is annually repaired, and kept in admirable 
order. 

Ecclesiastical Stofe.— The parish church is as conveniently si- 
tuate for the majority of the parishioners, as it well could be. It is 
built at the eastern inhabited extremity of the parish, within the 
easy reach of a dozen families,— while the great body of the con- 
gregation are from three to six miles distant. Notwithstanding 
such a manifest inconvenience, the church is well attended. It is 
by no means large enough for the congregation. It is seated only 
for 290 souls ; and there are no seat rents paid. There is no re- 
cord of the period at which it was built. It was partially roofed 
anew, and otherwise repaired, some years ago. There are now, 
however, manifest appearances of decay about the roof and galle- 
ries; and it is fondly hoped, another repair will not be attempted, 
but that a new parish church will be erected in a more centrical 
situation. The manse was built in 1830-31, and is commodious. 
The glebe is somewhat extensive, but, from the rugged, rocky 
nature of the ground, is far from being valuable. The amount 
of stipend depends a good deal on the fiar prices, and for many 
years has not exceeded L. 170 per annum. There are no Chapels 
of Ease in the parish, nor Government ministers, nor Missionaries. 



kiNTAIL. 179 

There are two catechists. There is a Popish priest resident in the 
parish, and his visiting bishop resides in Banffshire. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are two Society 
schools, where the ordinary branches of education are taught, 
Gaelic, English, grammar, writing, arithmetic, church music, &amp;c 
The salary of the parish schoolmaster does not exceed L. 27, in- 
cluding allowance for garden ; and he does not possess the legal 
accommodation, from the great poverty of the inhabitants. There 
are hardly any school dues paid ; it is almost vain to exact any. 
In all probability, there are not forty shillings of school dues an- 
nually paid in the parish. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of paupers re- 
ceiving parochial aid, may be stated at 30. The highest annual 
rate is 9s. Begging is considered and felt as a degradation by the 
natives, although this feeling, from the growing poverty of the 
country, is not so strong as it once was ; but even still it is only 
when dire necessity urges, and every other resource fails, that parish 
relief, or the bounty of their neighbours is sought; and it is only 
on occasions of unusual and peculiar distress, that they go a-beg- 
ging to other districts. The annual amount of collections at the 
church door, averages about L. 9. The paupers are arranged in 
three classes; the lowest class seldom receive more than 4s. an- 
nually. The small amount of our collections may be accounted for, 
by the circumstance of there being no resident heritor,— by our 
church-going population being, with few exceptions, extremely poor, 
—and the parish funds having received no aid but once, on a late 
occasion, from any of the non-resident heritors. The evils attend- 
ing non-residence are greatly felt here. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
A great change has certainly taken place in the worldly circum- 
stances of the people, since the last Statistical Account of this pa- 
rish was drawn up. Then, almost every respectable householder 
paid rent to the laird, and all were in easy, happy, and compara- 
tively affluent circumstances. The contrary is now too often 
the case. Rents were raised, the people became poor, they were 
either deprived of, or voluntarily gave up, their possessions; and 
many who, then, were in good circumstances, with from six to 
ten and even sixteen milk cows, with horses, goats, sheep, &amp;c. 
have since died in poverty, or now live in penury; and yet, 
strange as it may seem, in manners and dress, there is the greatest 
improvement. Formerly, parents and children wore nothing but 



180 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



stuffs of home manufacture. They had plenty of wool, and leisure 
enough to turn it to the best account. Inverness or Dingwall were 
at too great a distance, to be visited by females, — many of whom 
never saw a merchant's shop ; and they seldom purchased from 
pedlars, whose wares were sold at an extravagant rate. Now, they 
have no wool of their own. The wages of the young people are 
raised. Cotton goods are cheap : and on Sabbath, the people are 
not only decently, but fashionably attired. 

But there is another improvement of much greater importance 
to which we must allude, — and that is the growing intelligence of 
the people. About fifty years ago, few, comparatively speaking, of 
the inhabitants, could read; and their knowledge hardly extended 
beyond the oi-dinary routine of their every-day occupations. But, 
in this respect, an agreeable change has taken place. A consi- 
derable majority of the younger portion of the population can read 
the Bible ; and indeed the whole body of the people may be said 
to pay more regard to the cultivation of their mind than at the 
period alluded to, — though even still, it must be confessed, there 
is much room for improvement, and much ignorance prevails, — 
accompanied sometimes with indifference to education. It is, how- 
ever, a pleasing reflection, that although the.progress of education 
is somewhat slow, and its advantages have not, as yet, appeared 
much amongst us, — it is advancing with a sure and steady pace, 
and that we are encouraged to hope the period is not far distant 
when our once neglected but interesting Highlanders may, as an 
educated and well informed peasantry, bear a comparison with any 
of the same class in Scotland, and be, at the same time, distin- 
guished, as they have uniformly been, for the correctness of their 
conduct, and the simplicity of their manners.

PRESBYTERY OF LOCHCARRON, SYNOD OF GLENEL&amp;. 

THE REV. JOHN M'RAE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

The district of Kintail, whicli formerly constituted a parish of 
that name, was, about a century ago, divided into two parishes, to 
one of which the original name of the district has been appropriat- 
ed, — while the other has received the name of Glensheil, from the 
valley which forms its central division. 

Name. — The etymology of this word is so obscure as to give 
abundant scope to the fancy of the philologist, being equally capa- 
ble of being interpreted the glen of cattle Glenshelibh, of hunt- 
ing Glensheilg, or of rain Glenshilidh,— any of which is suf- 
ficiently descriptive of the locality, while there is none of them 
so exactly represented by the modern pronunciation of the name 
as to determine its meaning. 

Boundaries. — The parish is bounded, on the north, by the arm 
of the sea called Lochduich, which divides it from the parishes of 
Loehalsh and Kintail, and the river of Croe ; on the east, by the 
parishes of Kiltarlity, Urquhart, and Kilmanivaig; on the south, 
by the parish of Glenelg ; and on the west, by the strait of Kyle- 
rea, which divides it from Skye. Its greatest length, which hes 
from east to west, is about 26 miles, with a breadth varying be- 
tween 2 and 6 miles. 

 T opographical Appearances.— The parish consists of two divi- 
sions, distinguished by physical characteristics. The eastern and 
larger division is of a decidedly alpine character. It consists of 
three ranges of lofty mountains, separated by narrow valHes. These 
chains, originating near the head of Lochduich, after running pa- 
rallel to each other in a southerly direction, for five miles, turn off 
to the south-east, and again trending to the east, join the ridges 
which separate the vallies of Strathglass, Glenmoristone, and Glen- 
garry. At their western extremities, they rise from the level of the 
sea, with a rapid and almost precipitous ascent, to an average 

 St Duthec's Loch. Tain has its Gaelic name from the same 

saint, Baile Dhuthich."

height little short of 4000 feet ; and presenting many series of 
pyramidal summits, among which the peak of Scur-uran is eminent- 
ly conspicuous, they form a piece of alpine scenery not often sur- 
passed in grandeur. The middle chain is distinguished by the 
name of Benmore, great mount ; that on the north is called Bein- 
fhadd, long mount ; and the other Meal-cheann-dearg, red-headed 
mass. 

Between these ridges, lie the valHes of Glensheil and Glenlichd, 
i. e. the valley of the fiat stone or fiag, — the former extending along 
the western, — the other, along the eastern base of Benmore. 

The valley of Glensheil is about fifteen miles long, the lower por- 
tion of which space consists of a level plain about eight miles long 
and half a-mile wide, containing some good meadow and arable land, 
through which the river Sheil winds between low banks ornament- 
ed with alder bushes. The lower end of this portion is occupied 
by the lake of Lochsheil. About the middle, its breadth gradual- 
ly diminishes, until the mountains approach so closely as to leave 
only room for the stream to pass between them. But after passing 
the level, at which the waters which run to the east divide from 
those flowing to the west, — the valley again expands, and forms a 
bed for the lake of Cluonie, which is about six miles long, and the 
middle of which marks the boundary of the parish in this direction. 

The valley of Glenlichd is shorter and narrower than the other, 
opening at its lower end into the strath of Croe, i. e. the Sheep 
Penn, which is about five miles long and two broad, and is drained 
by the river Croe, which here divides the parish from Kintail. 

The western division of the parish, called Letterfearn, i. e. the 
alder side, consists of the north side of a hill, of the average height 
of about 2000 feet, and is 12 miles long and 2 broad, forming 
the south bank of Lochduich, and extending from Kyle-rea to the 
pass of Ratagan, where it joins the most southerly of the mountain 
chains already described. The character of this division is far more 
attractive than that of the other. The rock is here well covered 
with soil, and clothed with pasture of remarkable verdure. The 
ground rises with a gentle slope from the water, the general uni- 
formity of the landscape being agreeably diversified with bold head- 
lands, precipitous ravines, and rocky eminences, interspersed with 
cultivated fields and clumps of natural wood. 

Meteorology. — Altliough no meteorological tables have been kept 
in this parish, the climate may be stated generally as characterized 

• The opposite side of the lech, in tke parish of Kintoil, is called Lettci-choil ; 

i. e, the wooded side.

by mildness and humidity. The thermometer seldom indicates a 
higher temperature than 77°, and has not been observed lower than 
24° of Fahrenheit. The average temperature, as ascertained by 
observations upon the heat of springs, may be about 47°. The 
changes in the pressure of the atmosphere are frequent and rapid, 
the mercury in the barometer, which usually stands at 29 inches, 
often rising or falling half an inch, in the course of a few hours. 

The heat of summer is tempered by the influence of a moist soil 
and cloudy sky, — while in the lower parts of the parish, in conse- 
quence of the vicinity of the ocean, frost is seldom felt, and is 
never intense, or of long continuance. The prevalent wind is 
the south-west, which blows more frequently than all other winds 
together. This wind, sweeping over the expanse of the At- 
lantic, and being consequently saturated with moisture, proceeding 
from a warmer to a colder latitude ; and having its temperature fur- 
ther depressed in passing over the mountains by which the parish 
is surrounded, is necessarily a rainy wind, and by its prevalence 
communicates the same character to the climate. The chief falls 
of rain are experienced in the months of August, September, and 
November. October is often ,dry, although storms of westerly wind, 
accompanied with thunder and lightning, not unfrequently occur. 
The winters are usually open and mild, snow seldom falling on the 
low grounds, and never lying for more than a few days ; but in the 
high mountains, it falls to a considerable depth, and does not en- 
tirely disappear before the middle of June. The spring months are 
always boisterous and inclement, and May is often cold and unge- 
nial, but in June and July the weather is almost invariably delightful. 
As a proof of the mildness of the climate, it may be mentioned that 
tender greenhouse plants, as hydrangea, fuchsia, balm, geranium, 
and others, live out the winter, in gardens, with scarcely any pro- 
tection from the weather. The climate is also extremely salubrious. 
No endemic disorder is known. Contagious diseases are rare, and 
since the disappearance of small-pox, have not been extensively 
mortal. The complaints most prevalent are pneumonia, rheuma- 
tism, and dyspepsia, with phlegmonous and erysipelatous affections ; 
disorders which have their origin, probably, in the fatigue and cold 
to which the people are exposed in prosecuting the herring fishery, 
combined with the effects of a moist climate and insufficient nourish- 
ment. Upon the whole, the inhabitants of the parish enjoy a fair 
portion of health. The prejudice against the practice of vaccina- 
tion, which at one time prevailed, has given way before the expe-

rience of its efficacy. There is no medical practitioner resident in 
the parish, the duties of that profession thus devolving on the 
minister.  

The prognostications of the weather usually referred to by the 
Highlanders, are entitled to little regard, being certain days of the 
week or month, — which they consider, on the authority of tradition 
alone, as types of the subsequent season. They ascribe certain in- 
fluences to the phases of the moon, equally unworthy of attention ; 
supposing that an increasing moon communicates a growing quali- 
ty to all substances, and a decreasing moon the contrary, — on which 
account they will not fell timber, cast peats, or cut hay, while the 
moon is on the increase, believing that they will not season proer- 
ly, — nor kill meat during the decrease, from an idea that doing so 
would occasion its shrinking. It is also a prevalent opinion that 
every moon imparts a peculiar character to the weather during its 
continuance, so that should it be new moon about the end of 
April or of October, the month of May, in the former case, will pos- 
sess the character of spring ; and in the latter, that of November 
will resemble autumn. 

Hydrography. — The arm of the sea which bounds the parish on 
the north, is closed in, on the west, by the eastern extremity of the 
Isle of Skye, with the exception of the straits of Kyle-rea and Kyle- 
akin, by which the loch communicates with the ocean, on either 
side of that island. This inlet consists of three distinct portions, 
the largest of which, called Lochalsh, divides the western end of 
Glensheil from the parish of that name. This piece of water, 
which runs east and west, is about 10 miles long, by 3 miles wide 
at its broadest part. It is divided into two parts by the low island 
of Glass Elian, i. e. Green Island, which is about thirty acres in ex- 
tent, with flat sandy shores extending so far on every side, as to 
leave only a narrow passage between it and either land. About four 
miles to the east of this island, the inlet divides into two unequal 

" Under the isresent liead, may be mentioned an extraordinary instance of absti- 
nence, which occurred about the close of the last century. A female of this parish, of 
the name of Isabella Macrae, of weak intellect, and a beggar, had left Glennioristone, 
where she had been soliciting alms, at the beginning of a fall of snow, which lay upon 
the ground for the unusually long period of six weeks. During the greater ]art of 
this time, the poor woman was not missed, her friends in this parish believing that she 
was waiting in Glenmoristone for the disappearance of the snow. It was at last ascer- 
tained that she had left that country, on her way home ; but it was only at the end of 
the period above-mentioned, that she was discovered, under a wreath of snow alive, 
after eating all the heather within her reach. She was known to have had a small 
quantity of oatmeal in her possession, which, with the heather, composed the whole of 
her sustenance, during the time that she remained under the snow. Though she lived 
some years afterwards, she never recovered an erect posture, and it is also recorded, 
that when found, her chest bore the imiircssion of her knees, in consequence of her 
having been so long in a sitting and stooping posture.

oranches, the largest of which runs in a south-east direction, and the 
other to the north-east. The former of these is properly called 
Lochduich, although it gives its name to the whole inlet. The length 
of this inner loch from the point where the other branch, which is 
called Lochlong, the Ship loch, joins it, is six miles, — its breadth at 
the entrance being half a mile; but towards its eastern extremity it 
widens to nearly two miles. Its course is nearly straight, with a 
slight curvature having its convexity to the south-west. At its 
eastern angle, it throws oflF a branch to the north-east, about a mile 
long and half a-mile wide, called the Little Loch. The depth of 
the water in this inlet, is various ; in the western division, it runs 
from 15 to 30 fathoms; at the entrance of Lochduich proper it 
does not exceed 10 fathoms ; but towards its head, it increases con- 
siderably, being in some parts from 80 to 100 fathoms. In the 
shallower parts, the bottom consists of rock, and sometimes sand and 
gravel ; at the great depths, it is always mud. 

The water of this inlet, in consequence of the narrowness of the 
passages by which it communicates with the ocean, neither of which 
exceeds a quarter of a mile in width, is much less salt than sea 
water usually is. Partly from this cause, it is sometimes observed, 
during severe frost, to become partially covered with a crust of ice 
about one-eighth of an inch thick. It has never been known, 
however, to be completely frozen over ; nor does the partial con- 
gelation now mentioned take place unless the weather is calm, and 
the frost has been preceded by rain, which floats on the surface of 
the sea, when there is no wind to occasion the mixture of the dif- 
ferent strata. 

During the autumn, the water is strongly luminous, when disturb- 
ed, in consequence of the multitudes of medusae, heroes, and 
other phosphorescent animals, which then appear in it. In ordi- 
nary weather, there is nothing peculiar in the colour ; but after 
heavy falls of rain, it is rendered so muddy that no object can be 
seen through it, at the depth of a few feet. The current runs with 
considerable rapidity, through the narrows at the entrance of the 
Loch, and both sides of Glass-Ellen ; and the rate at springtides may 
here amount to four miles an hour. In the strait which divides the 
parish from Skye, the current is extremely rapid, running at times 
at the rate of seven miles per hour. It is high water in the inlet 
about six o'clock, on the day before new and full moon. The or- 
dinary height to which the tide rises, with springs, is 16 feet. 
Both the height and time of high water, however, are much influ- 



186 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



enced by the direction and force of tlie wind. A gale of south- 
west wind often raises the water 4 feet above the elevation which 
It would otherwise attain, and at the same time causes it to rise 
half an hour sooner than the proper time of high water,— while a 
north or east wind produces the opposite effect. The change of 
tide in Kyle-akin, in consequence of the water having to make the 
circuit of the island of Skye, before it comes to the entrance of 
this strait, is generally three hours later than in the other passage, 
although the distance between them does not exceed four miles. ' 

The whole of the inlet affords safe anchorage for shipping of 
any size. At the junction of Lochduich with Lochalsh, occurs the 
harbour of Ob-Inag, a creek of a semicircular form, having a suf- 
ficient depth of water, a muddy bottom, and shelter from every 
wind. The bay of Ardintoul also, and that of Craigan-roy, at the 
south corner of Lochduich, are safe and commodious harbours. 

Although the whole of this inlet, and particularly Lochduich 
proper, is sheltered by the barrier of mountains which inclose it 
from every wind, it is very subject to heavy squalls. This is the 
consequence of the height and steepness of the hills, which inter- 
rupt the fair passage of the wind. During a gale of south-west 
wind, which blows perpendicularly to the direction of the inner 
loch, the water is torn up in spoondrift, and sometimes whirled 
about to a great height in the air. On such occasions, the loch 
presents the appearance of an immense boiling and smoking caul- 
dron. In fine weather, Lochduich assumes a remarkably pleasing 
character. The view then presented from its entrance, when its 
verdant and finely variegated banks are seen, in contrast to the 
magnificent back ground formed by the mountains at its termina- 
tion, and when the whole scene is reflected from the glassy surface 
of the water, is one which combines loveliness with grandeur, in a 
degree seldom equalled, and certainly not exceeded, on the west 
coast of Scotland. 

In the eastern portion of the parish, two rivers of moderate size 
occur, each running from the eastward, with a course of about 
twelve miles, and falling into the loch at its south and east corners. 
The water of both is remarkably clear, in consequence of their flow- 
ing from high mountains nearly destitute of moss. Both are favourite 
resorts of salmon and trout. The parish is abundantly supplied 
with springs, which gush out at short intervals ; distinguished from 
the superficial rivulets, by the channels in which they flow being 
no wider or deeper, than is necessary to contain the stream, and by

the profusion of saxifrage, water cresses, and other fontine plants, by 
which their course is accompanied ; and their generally forming a 
plot of marshy land covered with alder and willow trees. There 
are no mineral springs except some that are tinged with iron ore, 
none of which are drunk medicinally. 

The lakes connected with the parish, of such extent as to re- 
quire notice, are three. Loch Cluonie, i. e. the lake of Meadows, 
the lai'gest, has been already mentioned. In the next valley to the 
south of it, occurs Loch Luin, about a mile long by half a mile 
broad. The water of both these lochs flows eastward into the 
river Moriston, and they abound in trout of good quality. The 
other lake is Lochsheil, also already mentioned, — through which 
the river Sheil flows to the sea. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The mountains of this parish con- 
sist chiefly of gneiss, variously modified in respect of the size and 
proportions of its component minerals, and alternating occasional- 
ly with mica slate. On the banks of Loch Cluonie, a tract of 
granite occurs, coarse grained, and tinged with red. That part 
of Letterfearn, which lies to the south-east of the church, consists 
of gneiss, deeply tinged of a red colour with iron ; beyond this, to 
the west, the rock resumes its ordinary grey colour. At this point, 
there occurs a bed of primitive limestone, grey, spotted with green 
and red, and very impure. A similar bed is found near the harbour 
of Ob-Inag, extending across the hill to Glenelg, and presenting 
veins of asbestos. In this last position, the rock has a manifest 
influence on the vegetation in its neighbourhood, which is un- 
usually verdant. The dip of the rocks is generally between 
north-east and south-east ; but both this and the angle of in- 
chnation, whish is generally considerable, are extremely irregular. 
In the higher mountains, masses of quartz and plates of mica, of 
considerable size, are found ; and along the shore, beds of soft 
talc slate are not unfrequent. In the hill above Ratagan, stones 
with drusy cavities containing crystals of quartz, lined with a yel- 
low metallic ore, are found; and to the west of the manse, cubical 
masses of the same substance, being probably an ore of iron, 
have been discovered. 

Soil. — The soil of thevalliesof Glensheiland Croe consists of gra- 
vel and sand of various degrees of fineness, well covered with vegetable 
mould, and would, in a more favourable climate, be well adapted for 
cultivation. Along the sea shore, the soil is generally a coarse gravel, 
containing many stones, carried down by the streams from the ravines 



188 



ROSS AND CROMAIITY. 



which they have formed in the sides of the mountains. These pieces 
of land are capable of producing good crops of bear or bigg ind po- 
tatoes, but require frequent supplies of manure. In the hollows which 
occur between rocks or the lower slopes of the hills, the soil is not 
unfrequently deep and fertile. In the higher mountains, peat does 
not exist in any considerable quantity, nor in the low grounds at 
all, with the exception of a small spot, near the outlet of Glen- 
sheil ; but the summit of the hill above Letterfearn is covered with 
this substance. Clay occurs in a few places, near the sea, and is 
used as mortar. From the frequency of rain, the greater part of 
the soil, with the exception of the gravelly spots above-mentioned, 
is naturally wet, while the nature of the subsoil, which is either 
rock or compact and impervious till, renders the operation of drain- 
ing laborious and expensive. The peculiar character of the rock 
also, which frequently protrudes from the soil, constitutes a seri- 
ous obstacle to agriculture. 

There are no mines of any description in the parish. 

Zoology — Quadrupeds. — Among wild animals, the first place 
must be assigned to the red-deer, which are still to be found in con- 
siderable numbers in the eastern parts of the parish. The roe is 
rarely to be met with. Hares are numerous, and the grey moun- 
tain species, which becomes white in winter, is found in the higher 
mountains, feeding upon the smooth green herbage which some- 
times occurs near the highest summits. The badger excavates his 
burrow in the lower slopes of the hills ; and from the cairns of bro- 
ken rock which occupy the same situations, the fox has not yet 
been extirpated. The fissures of the rocks harbour numbers of 
wild cats and polecats. The marten is not unfrequent in the 
woods, and of the clefts of rocks that border the lakes or the sea, 
the otter is a constant tenant. Weasels are numerous, and the 
stoat is occasionally seen. Rats and mice abound, although the 
former have only appeared within the last few years. Moles are 
very numerous, but the squirrel, hedgehog, and rabbit are unknown. 

Birds. — In the precipices among the higher mountains, the 
brown and black eagles build their nests, to the serious injury 
of the sheep-farmer, to whose young lambs they are scarcely less 
destructive than the fox. The osprey frequents similar situations 
near the sea. The white and brown owls, kite, and buzzard are 
numerous. Hawks of different species abound, as do also the rook, 
raven, and hooded-crow, but the magpie is rare, and the carrion- 
crow, the jack-daw, and the jay have not been seen. The cuckoo

189 



regularly ushers in the summer, and its yOting, found in the nest 
of the titlark, has been frequently reared, but in no instance has 
it lived to utter its peculiar note. The wryneck and woodpecker 
are unknown, as are also the kingsfisher, hoopoe, and creeper. The 
black-cock is rare ; but the red grouse are rather numerous, and 
among the heaps of stones which occur on the higher slopes of the 
mountains, the ptarmigan is not unfrequently seen. Partridges 
are not numerous. The rock and wood pigeons occur, but rarely. 
The stare is also a rare bird. The missel, blackbird, redwing, field- 
fare, and throstle are common. The ring-ouzel is sometimes, and 
the water-ouzel frequently, met with. The chatterer and gross- 
beak are unknown, but finches and buntings abound, — especially of 
the former genus, the chaffinch, bullfinch, sparrow, and linnet, — 
and of the latter, the common, yellow, and snow-buntings ; the last 
named species generally appearing in large flocks, before the first 
snow of the winter. The wood and field-larks are unknown, but the 
skylarks and titlarks are numerous ; as are also the white and the 
yellow wagtails, the red-breast, stone-chat, and wren. The great 
and blue titmice are abundant. The window swallow is a regular 
visitor, and the goat-sucker is sometimes heard. 

Of the class of waders, the heron, curlew, woodcock, snipe, sand- 
piper, oyster-catcher, and golden plover, are well known, the last 
occupying in great flocks the summits of the less elevated moun- 
tains. The rare long-legged species Himantopus melanopterus 
has been found. The corn-rail is familiar in the hay fields, and the 
water-hen occurs in the marshes. Among the fin-footed birds, the 
coot and grebe are seen ; and of the numerous tribes of web-footed 
birds, the guillemot and imber, the gull and the tern may be men- 
tioned. The stormy-petrel has been observed, skimming over the 
sea, or floating on its surface when calm. The red-breasted goosan- 
der, the smew, and the cormorant, are often seen diving along the 
shores ; the wild swan, in severe winters, visits the lakes ; the lag- 
goose and the bernacle are not unknown ; and the mallard, teal, 
widgeon, and tufted duck are common on the lakes and loch. 

Fishes.— Kmong the inhabitants of the waters, of the cetaceous 
class, the herring-whale and the fin-fish, the dolphin, porjjoise, and 
seal, are all occasional;visitors. Of cartilaginous fishes, there occur 
the piked and the spotted dog-fish, the skate and the thornback, the 
angler and the pipe-fish. The sturgeon has been sometimes taken of 
a large size. Of the apodal bony fishes, may be mentioned the con- 
ger and common eel, and the lance or sand-eel. Among the jugular 



190 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



fishes, the important genus of the cod deserves the first notice. Of 
this tribe, the common cod, the haddock, the bib, the cole-fish, the 
whiting, the hake, the ling, and the pollack or lythe are well known. 
The five-bearded cod and the tusk have been found. The smooth, 
the spotted, and the viviparous blenny are numerous on the rocky 
shores ; as are two species of flounder, on the sandy shallows. The 
common wrasse and sea-perch are often taken ; and the elegantly 
marked bimaculated wrasse is sometimes caught. The common mack- 
erel is numerous, as is also the scad or horse mackerel; but neither is 
much esteemed. The grey gurnard visits the loch, in great numbers, 
in autumn; the red is also sometimes taken. Both on the sea shore 
and in the rivers, the salmon and the white trout are abundant. 
The lakes abound with the yellow spotted trout. The grey mul- 
let is sometimes caught ; but the herring is the staple fish of the 
parish. It usually enters the loch, early in August, at which time 
it is always full of roe and milt, or lean, and feeding on its own fry, 
which at this season it devours so greedily, as to be frequently 
caught upon the hooks baited with a white feather for catching the 
young cole-fish. The next shoal which enters the loch, about the 
end of August, is generally of fine quality, fat and large. From 
this period, the fish usually decrease in numbers, and fall off in qua- 
lity till the beginning of December, when they gradually disappear. 
It is not a little remarkable, that, at the period of the season in 
which the herring is in the finest condition, there is nothing to be 
found in its stomach. This is probably the consequence of its 
feeding at this time upon animalcules, which are either invisible 
from their diminutive size or transparency, or are so quickly digest- 
ed as to have escaped observation, probably upon the luminous 
kinds which always accompany it. 

Reptiles. — The only reptiles are frogs, toads, and lizards. No 
serpents have occurred in the parish. 

Insects. — The insects of this parish have not attracted much atten- 
tion ; consequently no rare or interesting kinds have been observed. 
Wild bees are numerous and of several species, forming their hives 
in the deep soil or in the mossy pastures. The scarlet and the 
white butterflies are very abundant. The gooseberry caterpillar is 
the only insect complained of as destructive to vegetation, and the 
midge as troublesome to man. The fly which deposits its eggs in 
the back of the sheep, has scarcely found its way this far north, 
and it is hoped that the wetness of the climate will prevent it from 
extending its ravages. The same cause probably preserves the 



GLENSHEIL.

fruit trees from the depreciations of insects. A beautiful caterpil- 
lar, resembling a green leaf bent into a tube, with its nerves and 
foot-stalk, was observed two years ago upon the Lombardy poplar. 

The only kinds of shell-fish which abound on the shores of 
Lochduich are whelks, limpets, and mussels, all of which are used 
as bait for fish, and in times of scarcity are resorted to by the poor 
people as food. Clams and other bivalves are rare. The lobster 
is scarcely known, but the green crab is very common. An ani- 
mal bearing a close resemblance to a leech was discovered by the 
writer, two years ago, under a stone at low water mark, of the ex- 
traordinary length of four yards. 

Botany. — The Flora of this parish does not seem to contain any 
plants but such as are common in similar situations in the High- 
lands, unless the Epilobium angustifolium, a large plot of which 
occurs near the church, be considered worthy of notice. Of the 
native plants applied to economical purposes, may be mentioned 
the common heath, the green tops of which dye a good yellow, 
and with indigo a tolerable green ; the bark of the alder, which, 
with the addition of copperas, forms a good black ; the Lecanora 
tartarea, which dyes a purple, and the Parmelia omphalodes, a 
reddish-brown. The twigs of the sallow are twisted into ropes, as 
a substitute for hemp, as are also the shavings of fir root, rushes 
and heath laid with the hand. In domestic practice, the leaves of 
the spearwort [Ranunculus lingua are used as a blister ; the red 
crane's-bill [Geranium robertianum, to abate the inflammation in 
erysipelas ; a cataplasm of hemlock {Cicuta virosa is a favourite ap- 
plication to indolent tumours ; and a decoction of the sundew [Dro- 
sera rotundifolia and longifolia is used to cure urinary disorders 
of cattle. 

The native fruits found in the parish are brambles, Rubusfi-uti- 
cosus and corylifol. ; roebuck berries {R. saxatilis ; raspberries, 
[R. idcBus ; of which the white variety occurs; cloudberries 
/. chamcBmorus ; strawberries [Fragaria vesca ; whortleberries 
Vaccijiummgrtillus a.nd V. vitisidcea ; bear-berries, Arbutus uva- 
ursi ; crow-berries, [Empetrum nigrum; roan-berries, Pyms 
aucuparia ; and hazel nuts. 

The native trees are the alder and the ash, the former occu- 
pying the swampy hollows, the latter the steep banks and rocky 
eminences. Both these kinds of timber cover a considerable ex- 
tent of the lower slopes of the hill of Letterfearn, growing quite 
down to the high water mark. These woods are of some importance

in an economical point of view, the first mentioned being well 
adapted for herring barrel staves, and the other for the purposes 
of the boat-carpenter and agriculturist. Besides these, hazel, 
mountain-ash, and willow, are found in considerable abundance. 
The rarer kinds are birch, bird-cherry, poplar, holly, oak, and elm. 
The native fir, which at one time must have covered a great ex- 
tent of the parish, its roots being found everywhere in the higher 
grounds, is now almost extirpated. 

The planting of timber has hitherto been attempted on a scale so 
very limited as to be unworthy of notice, except so far as to observe 
that the result of such experiments as have been made is such as 
to hold out ample encouragement to this species of improvement. 
The trees to which the soil seems most congenial, next to the al- 
der and ash, are the larch, the elm, and the plane tree. But there 
is no sort of timber cultivated in Scotland, that would not thrive, 
under careful management. 

II. — Civil History. 

Of the history of this parish, little is known of an earlier date 
than the middle of the thirteenth century. About this period, Co- 
lin Fitzgerald, the founder of the family of Seaforth, received from 
Alexander III. the governorship of Castle Donan in Kintail, in 
reward, it is said, of his conduct at the battle of Lrgs. Letter- 
fearn was then possessed by tribes of the names of Macbheolan, 
Macaulay, &amp;c. ; and if tradition can be relied upon, it was by a 
practice not uncommon in those times, of fomenting quarrels 
amongst these septs, and then obtaining " power of fire and sword" 
against them as unruly subjects, that the Mackenzies managed to 
possess themselves of the country. About the beginning of the 
following century, the Macraes, a clan of Irish origin, who appear 
to have come over to this country, before or along with Fitzgerald, 
as they are staled to have fought under him at Largs, and after- 
wards settled for some generations in the Aird of Lovat, emigrated 
into the parish, where they gradually increased in numbers and 
consequence, until they became almost exclusively the occupants 
of the lands.  

• Although a matter of little importance, it may be proper here to state, that the un- 
worthy invention which an individual of a neighbouring district palmed upon the 
credulity of Dr Johnston, and to which the weight of that great name has given cur- 
rency • viz. that the Macraes only attained to consequence by marrying the widows 
of tlic'lVIaclennans slain at Auldearn,— is destitute of all foundation, and contradicted 
bv ample evidence, written and traditional, from which it clearly appears, 1. That 
the Macraes were a tribe of considerable notice, before the Maclennans existed as a clan 
known by that name ; 2. that the former had attained to a higher degree of import-

The most interesting historical event connected with the parish 
is the action which was fought in the cause of the Stewarts in the 
valley of Glensheil, in June 1719, between the Macraes, sup- 
ported by some other adherents of the family of Seaforth, and 400 
Spaniards, commanded by Earl William of that name; and a 
body of the Royal troops. The principal force of the Highland- 
ers was posted on the north bank of the Shell, on a steep emi- 
nence overlooking the narrow pass, into which the valley is here 
contracted ; and round the base of which, on the brink of the tor- 
rent, which at this place forms a succession of falls and deep pools, 
wound the rugged path by which the Royal forces were advancing. 
The Spaniards occupied a similar eminence on the south bank ; 
while a small party, at the head of which was the celebrated Rob 
Roy, was stationed about a quarter of a mile to the eastward, be- 
hind a hillock, with the view of surprising and surrounding the ene- 
my. The advantages of this strong position were rendered una- 
vailing by the superior discipline of the King's troops, and the trea- 
chery or cowardice of the foreign auxiliaries. The Highlanders 
fought with their accustomed bravery, repelling three several at- 
tempts to dislodge them from their position. A fourth attack 
proved more successful. Earl William being dangerously wound- 
ed, and the Royalists having, with hand grenades, set fire to the long 
heather among which the Highlanders were posted, the latter fell 
into confusion : and receiving no support from the Spaniards, who, 
on a party being detached to attack them, laid down their arms 
without firing a shot, they retired, carrying along with them their 
wounded leader. Of Rob Roy, it is recorded, that having, with 
more zeal than judgment, attacked the rear of the enemy's column 
before they had become engaged in front, his little party was rout- 
ed, and the intention of placing the King's troops between two fires, 
was thus defeated. In constructing the Parliamentary road which 
runs through this pass, a few years since, several bullets and some 
pieces of musket barrels were found ; and the green mounds which 
cover the graves of the slain, among which, that of the « Dutch 
Colonel," Wightman, is distinguished, and the ruins of a rude 
breastwork, which the Highlanders had constructed on the crest of 
the hill to cover their position,— still mark the scene of the con- 
flict.

Antiquities. — On the estate of Letterfearn, near the harbour of 
Ob-Inag, are the remams of one of those singular structures, which, 
for want of a better name, have ben denominated " Picts' houses." 
This building, like the rest of the same kind, is of a circular shape, 
having the faces of the wall separated by an interval, which, at the 
base, is 3 feet wide, but diminishes gradually upwards, until it en- 
tirely disappears. Across this space, rows of band-stones are laid 
in a spiral manner, connecting the two faces of the wall. The in- 
ternal diameter is 25 feet, and the thickness of the wall, including 
the enclosed space, is 9 feet. An aperture of 4 by 5 feet occurs 
on the side that looks to the sea. The building is constructed of 
flat stones, the greater number of which are of large size that co- 
vering the entrance, which is of a triangular form, cannot weigh 
less than a ton, apparently carried from a heap of stones of the 
same kind that occurs in the immediate vicinity. These stones 
are laid with remarkable accuracy, especially on the external face, 
being so closely fitted as to leave no room for pinnings, but with- 
out mortar. The internal surface is less carefully built; and no 
attention has been bestowed on smoothing the sides of the inter- 
vening space, into which the pointed ends of the longer stones are 
suffered to protrude far beyond the general level. There is no 
tradition, except such as is manifestly fabulous, respecting the date 
or purpose of this building. The peculiarity of its construction, 
indeed, indicates an origin too remote to leave room to expect that 
the case should be otherwise. This is a subject, the investigation 
of which demands and merits more attention than it has hitherto 
received. These towers seem to point to an era and a state of 
society, concerning which history is altogether silent. Respecting 
the intention with which they were erected, no theory has yet been 
suggested that is not liable to objection. The opinion of their 
having been strongholds for securing the cattle, is contradicted by 
their limited dimensions, and by the care bestowed, and the labour 
expended in their construction. That they were intended as places 
of refuge from an invading enemy, is rendered equally improbable, 
by their being unprovided with loopholes for the discharge of wea- 
pons, and their being sometimes, as in the present instance, com- 
manded and overlooked by a neighbouring eminence. For bemg 
permanent places of residence, they seem not at all adapted, hav- 
intr had neither windows nor roof; and did their construction, other- 
wise, admit of the supposition, that they were meant for watch- 
towers or beacons, the position of this one, which is situated in a 



GLENSHEIL. I95 

hollow, from which there is but a very limited view, would prove 
Its fallacy. But in whatever obscurity the particular purpose of 
their, erection may be involved, these buildings clearly indicate, by 
their great size and the mode of their construction, a measure of 
skill in the practice of masonry, and a state of society admitting the 
combination of the powers of many, to produce a common result, 
not easily reconcilable with the barbarism so unhesitatingly as- 
cribed to our remote ancestors. 

A barrow, constructed of small flat stones, laid with great neat- 
ness, and covered with flags overlapping one another in an imbri- 
cated manner, was discovered a few years since, in digging for gra- 
vel for the road upon the west side of the valley of Glensheil. Its 
height was 5 feet, its width 2 feet 3 inches. It ran in a sloping 
direction from the bottom to the top of a small hillock of gravel 
to the length of 26 feet Nothing was found in it that could 
throw any light on its history. 

Land-owners.— The whole lands of this parish, as well as of 
the neighbouring parishes of Kintail and Lochalsh, were posses- 
sed by the family of Seaforth, until within the present century, 
when the greater part of them was alienated. The property of 
Letterfearn, comprehending the portion of the division of thatname, 
lying westward of the church, was purchased in 1834, by the late 
Lachlan Mackinnon of Corry, for about L. 15000; and that of 
Glensheil, consisting of the remaining portion of Letterfearn, and 
the south and west side of the valley of Glensheil, by Charles 
Lillingston, Esq. of Ipswich, for L. 28,000. The rest of the pa- 
rish, mcluded between the rivers Shell and Croe, belongs still to 
the representative of the family of Seaforth, the Honourable Mrs 
Stewart Mackenzie. 

Modern Buildings. -There is no building of a class superior to 
that of farm-houses in the parish. These, including two recently 
bmlt on Mrs S. Mackenzie's property, are substantial and com- 
fortable, though small. There is no mill, those of the neioh- 
bourmg parishes of Kintail and Lochalsh being sufficiently acces- 
sible to the mhabitants. 

The gneiss of the mountains to the eastward, though difficult to 
dress, is sufficiently compact to form excellent building stone. That 
ot Letterfearn is too much intersected with fissures, to be fit for the 
purpose. An attempt made, a few years ago, to burn the limestone 
ot Letterfearn into lime, was unsuccessful, the lime produced prov- 
mg too impure to be fit for mortar. But good lime is to be had 
at Broadford m Skye, at the distance of twenty-four miles, from

which it is carried, in boats, to this country. The price there is 6J. 
per boll. 

Strathspey timber of natural growth is generally used in the 
farmers' houses; but in those lately erected on Mrs S. Macken- 
zie's property, planted fir from Brahan has been employed. 

The houses occupied by the letters are of a very inferior de- 
scription. They are invariably built of dry stone, i. e. without any 
kind of mortar, roofed with couples of unsquared alder, the lower 
ends of which are built into the wall, joined together by a few 
horizontal spars fastened with trenails, on which are laid the small 
sticks called " kebbers," which support the thatch. The latter 
consists of a layer of thin parings of turf, neatly laid on in the man- 
ner of slates, and afterwards covered with heather, ferns, or rushes. 
The interior of the building is divided into three compartments, in 
one of which the family sit, eat, and sleep ; another contains the 
potatoes ; and the third, through which the entrance leads, is con- 
verted, in winter, to the purposes of a byre, containing the cows and 
stirks. 

The only apertures, besides the door, are a window, on the prin ■ 
cipal apartment, the upper part of which is sometimes, though 
rarely, glazed, and the lower fitted with wooden shutters ; and a 
hole, on the roof, for the emission of the smoke. The fire is light- 
ed on the earthen floor, and supported by a large stone set on end : 
over it, depends, from the sooty rafters, the wooden crook, by which 
the pot is suspended. 

There is a " genealogical account of the Macraes," written by 
a Mr John Macrae, minister in Dingwall, who died in 1704, a copy 
of which, in manuscript, is in the possession of Lieut. Col. Sir 
John Macrae of Ardintoul, containing some curious information 
respecting the early history of the country and its inhabitants. 

III. — Population. 

During the disorderly period of feudal independence that suc- 
ceeded the downfal of the Norwegian authority, the inhabitants of 
this parish, in common with those of the Highlands in general, 
took an active part in the commotions of the times ; and in every 
contest, in which the Mackenzies of Seaforth were engaged with 
the neighbouring clans, the Macraes proved themselves faithful and 
efficient adherents of that family. They were also, under the chief 
of that name, concerned in the wars of the Stuarts, and fought at 
Auldearn and Sherilfmuir, as well as at Glensheil, but took no pari 
in the struggle of J 745. 

The period that preceded and succeeded this last era, so im- 



GLENSHEIL. 



197 



portant in the history of the Highlands, seems to have been one, 
during which the inhabitants of this parish enjoyed a large measure 
of prosperity. It is still referred to as a species of golden age ; and, 
after making every necessary allowance for the fondness with which 
it is natural that the memory of better times should be cherished 
under the pressure of present misery, it is likely that the people, 
during the period in question, possessed, in a high degree, the sub- 
stantial comforts of life. Secluded by their inaccessible position 
from the turmoil of general society, enjoying, to a considerable ex- 
tent, in virtue of their high character for prowess, security of life 
and property ; and holding their lands on such terms as admitted of 
their consuming among themselves a large proportion of the pro- 
duce ; they passed their days in peace and comfort, alike free from 
the drudgery of labour and the privations of indigence. The coun- 
try was, at this period, exclusively stocked with black-cattle. The 
flesh of these, with the produce of the dairy, in the management of 
which they were noted for their skill, oat-cake and salmon, constitut- 
ed their food. They were clothed with kelt or tartan manufactured 
from the fleeces of a few sheep kept for the purpose, and if their 
luxuries were not numerous, their wants were few in proportion. 
About the beginning of the present century, the change of stock 
from black-cattle to sheep, which has tended so materially to alter 
the whole social system of the Highlands, began to be introduced. It 
could not have long escaped observation, that the mountainous pas- 
tures of this parish could be employed to greater profit in feeding 
the sheep, to which the most lofty and rugged eminences are ac- 
cessible, and which can exist during the" severity of winter, inde- 
pendently of artificial provision and shelter, than in rearing the less 
hardy and active cow. Yet the change was not introduced but with 
great caution and much reluctance on the part of tenantry. It was 
apprehended, that though the breeding of sheep was carried on with 
great advantage in the finer pastures and milder climates of other 
parts of the country, they could not live among the sterile and stormy 
mountains of this quarter. A series of unusually severe seasons, 
which occurred about this period, seemed to justify these fears. It was 
also, and with more reason dreaded, that a system of husbandry, 
which could only be carried on to profit on large farms, and which 
required a mode of management so diff"erent from that to which they 
had been accustomed, as to render their skill in that branch of agri- 
culture of no avail, might lead to the removal of the ancient occu- 
pants of the soil, and the introduction of strangers, possessed of the 



198 



ROSS AND CROMAUTV. 



necessary capital and experience. Tiiese apprehensions, which re- 
tarded for some time the change of stock, have proved in part to 
have been unfounded. The success of the first experiments shew- 
ed at once, that the climate and pasture were perfectly congenial to 
the sheep. The rearing of black cattle was by degrees abandon- 
ed, and there is at present no farm in the parish except two small 
lotted farms in Letterfearn, of which the staple commodities do not 
consist of wool and mutton. But though the change now describ- 
ed produced an amazing increase of rent, the advance, in some 
instances, of mountain pasture amounting to from 1000 to 6000 
per cent, in the course of a single generation, the effect upon 
the population was not so favourable. The valuable and respect- 
able class of " substantial tenants" has been entirely swept away ; 
such of their number as did not emigrate to America, having sunk 
to the rank of letters or cottars upon the large farms, are crowd- 
ed along the shores of the loch, dependent for subsistence upon the 
laborious and uncertain pursuit of the herring fishing, or the still 
more fatiguing, precarious, and pernicious practice of smuggling. 
Nor has the ruin thus brought upon the tenantry been unattend- 
ed with a corresponding reaction upon the landlords. Notwith- 
standing the incredibly rapid increase of the value of the lands, the 
expectations of this class, and the additional expenditure to which 
these led, rose in a progression still more rapid, and the result is ap- 
parent in the fact, that the whole lands of the parish were lately 
under trust or assignation, in consequence of pecuniary incum- 
brances. Such of the descendants of the original occupants as were 
possessed of sufficient means have become store-farmers on a large 
scale, and, with the experience of a few years, have profited so 
much by the example of such strangers from the south as have set- 
tled among them, that they now manage their farms with a skill not 
inferior to that of their instructors. 

There is no village in the parish, unless the assemblages of houses 
occupied by the class of letters already mentioned, be considered as 
such.

Character of the People, 8fc. — The male inhabitants have long 
been remarkable for the personal qualities of great size, strength, 
activity, and courage ; the females, for beauty and gracefulness ; 
and both sexes, for an extraor.dinary taste for the cultivation of poe- 
try and music.  

The personal quaHties of the people are, however, undergoing 
a change, corresponding to that which has taken place in their cir- 
cumstances and habits. They are still indeed a taller race than 
the inhabitants of the neighbouring parishes ; but even this only re- 
maining distinction is rapidly disappearing under the combined in- 
fluences of hard labour and scanty aliment. 

The language generally spoken is Gaelic. Forty years ago, there 
was little English known ; but that language is now, from the joint 
effect of schools and increased intercourse with strangers, rapidly 
gaining ground ; and there is scarcely an individual of the rising 
generation that does not understand and speak a little of it, the 
advantage of which is daily experienced. 

Dancing may be stated as the favourite amusement of the people, 
within doors. Weddings are still celebrated in a style more expen- 
sive than the circumstances of the parties can well afford ; and dur- 
ing the winter holidays, subscription balls are occasionally held. The 
abominable practice of drinking to excess at funerals is now nearly 
abolished. The dub or shintt/ used formerly to be much played on 

• One Duncan IMacrao, an inhabitant of the valley of Glensheil, in the early part 
of the last century, possessed these qualities in such a degree, as to entitle him to be 
regarded as a type of the distinguishing characteri'tics, physical and intellectual, of 
his countrymen. A stone of immense size, which he carried to some distance in his 
arms, remains upon the farm of Achnangart, as a monument of his extraordinary 
strength. The thieves of Lochaber often experienced his sagacity, activity, and cou- 
rage, in recovering his own and his neighbour's cattle ; and several poetical composi- 
tions, distinguished for pathos and pious sentiment, prove that this Highland " Ca- 
thernach," in common with heroes of greater celebrity, amidst the din of arms, did not 
neglect the gentler arts of peace. He was killed, with many of the best men of his 
surname, at Sheriffmuir in 1715, but not, it is said, before he had, with his broad 
sword, done terrible execution among the ranks of the enemy ; and his formidable 
weapon was long, and perhaps still is, preserved in the tower of London, and shewn as 
the " Great Highlander's sword."

Christmas and New Year's Day, O. S. ; but this pastime is now al- 
most abandoned to the boys. 

In their personal habits, the people manifest as great a love for 
cleanliness as their circumstances admit ; the smallness and smoki- 
ness of their houses, and their general poverty being strongly op- 
posed to the practice of this virtue. The Highland dress is still 
a good deal worn, on occasions of public meetings, especially by the 
young men in the higher district of the parish. The ordinary cloth- 
ing of the males consists of a short coat or jacket and trowsers of 
kelt, blue, or checquered of different colours, manufactured at home, 
and dyed with the native substances before enumerated ; a cotton 
waistcoat, shirt, and neckcloth ; the blue felt bonnet, flat or cock- 
ed, and shoes and stockings ; the former generally made by each 
individual for himself, of home-tanned leather, the latter spun and 
wrought by the females of the family. The females, until about 
forty years ago, were universally clothed in worsted stuffs, generally 
dyed blue, with narrow stripes of red, of domestic manufacture, 
and woven by country weavers, and are still generally clad in 
the same material when engaged in field or other labour, but 
always appear at social meetings and at church dressed in cotton 
garments, of which last substance the shift is always composed. 
Caps are seldom worn, except by such women as have had children, 
or are married, and the straw bonnet is not yet assumed by the 
native females of the lower class. The ordinary food of this 
class consists of potatoes ; along with which, they generally have 
herrings, but sometimes nothing but salt. Oat cake and flesh meat 
are luxuries which they can but seldom afford ; and butter and 
cheese, though favourite articles, they can but rarely indulge in. 
Oatmeal, when it can be procured, is used in the form of cake or 
gruel, being seldom made into porridge. The universal beverage 
is cold water. In their eating and drinking, the people are scru- 
pulously cleanly ; and they will walk a considerable distance to a 
fountain, rather than quench their thirst at a common brook. Beer 
is unknown. 

It cannot be said with truth, that the class of people of which 
the great majority of the population consists, enjoy the comforts of 
life in even a moderate degree. Poorly fed, scantily clothed, and 
miserably lodged, theirs is a life of penury and toil. Exposed to 
the temptations of idleness without its ease, and to the slavery of 
labour without its rewards, they drag out a wretched existence, suf- 
fering under the continual fear of impending want, and uncheered by 



GLENSHEIL. 



201 



any prospect of amendment in their condition. It cannot be ex- 
pected, that a people thus situated should feel satisfied with their 
condition ; but they have learned to submit to their hard fate, and 
bear their numerous privations with a degree of patience extreme- 
ly commendable. 

In place of any general statement respecting the character of 
the people, the following incident may be taken as highly charac- 
teristic of the peculiar features by which it is distinguished. When 
the eatates of William Earl of Seaforth were forfeited, on account 
of the share his family took in the rebellion of 1715 and 1719, and 
the noble proprietor was under the necessity of quitting the king- 
dom, the Commissioners on the forfeited estates appointed a Mr 
Ross of Fearne, as factor under them, to collect the rents. This 
gentleman, regardless of intimations which he received of the de- 
termination of the people of the country to resist any attempt to 
collect their rents, except for the behoof of the person whom they 
still considered their lawfid proprietor, proceeded to the west, ac- 
companied by his son and some other attendants. On the day that 
these unwelcome visitants were expected, six men, armed with mus- 
kets, stationed themselves near the pass by which they were ad- 
vancing on the road leading from Strathglass. Aware that his life 
was in danger, Ross had, befo-e his party came to the pass, ex- 
changed horses with his son, directing the latter to ride some dis- 
tance in advance. This arrangement proved fatal to the young 
man, for no sooner had he come within range of the Highlander 
guns, than, mistaking him for his father, three of themlired and 
he fell dead; upon witnessing which, the factor and his attendants 
turned their horses and fled. Many subsequent attempts were 
made to levy the rents; but, though supported by the presence of 
a military force, they proved equally unsuccessful. While the 
peoph were thus resisting the royal authority, they acted a part 
which showed that their violent conduct was dictated, not hv seU 
fish motives, but by fidelity to their absent chief. Thev volun 
tarily paid their rents to his factor, Mr Murchison of Auchtertvre" 
ancestor of the present distinguished Secretary of the Geological 
Society, and that gentleman regularly carried or sent them to 
France, where the expatriated Earl then resided, for many years, 
until the forfeited estates were restored. 

The qualities of stern determination and disinterested attach- 
ment exemplified in this transaction, may be said to be still cha 
racteristic of the people of this parish. Recent occurrences, which

HOSS AND CllOMARTY. 



it would be tedious to detail, have shewn, that, with all their pa- 
tient endurance of hardship, there is a point beyond which oppres- 
sion becomes dangerous, especially when exercised in a shape cal- 
culated to irritate the suppressed but not yet extinct feelings of 
the Highlander. In illustration of the moral character of the 
people, it may be mentioned, that a slight wooden latch, to ex- 
clude the cattle, is all the fastening that is deemed necessary for 
the door of a house in the absence of the family; that instances of 
theft are very rare ; that no illegitimate child has been born in 
the parish for the last three years ; that no murder or robbery has 
been committed in the parish within the memory of man ; and 
that, for the last eighty years, no native of the parish, or indivi- 
dual of the name of Macrae, has been convicted of a felony. 
This freedom from crime may be ascribed in part to the influence 
of a species of local patriotism, through which each individual 
member of the community is deterred from the commission of 
any improper act, by the consideration of the disgrace which might 
accrue from his misconduct, to his country; but chiefly to the 
constraining force of a deep though unostentatious feeling of 
piety and religious principle, with which the minds of the people 
are imbued. Of the first of these salutary influences, the power 
is gradually giving way before the increasing intercourse with 
strangers, and the other, it is to be feared, will prove no more than 
sufficient to counteract the force of the various demoralizing agen- 
cies which are now at work among them. 

Among these, the practice of smuggling holds the first place. 
Illicit distillation, which was introduced about twenty years since, 
prevails, especially upon the estate of Letterfearn, to an extent that 
threatens to prove destructive to all habits of regular industry, inju- 
rious to the health, and ruinous to the morals of its victims ; and is 
likely to continue to produce these distressing results, until the own- 
ers of the land choose to discountenance it. The consequences of 
the praiseworthy conduct of some of the neighbouring proprietors 
prove, that, while the severe, but desultory, and therefore ineffec- 
tual exertions of the revenue officers have failed of putting down 
this baneful mischief, a simple prohibition on the part of the land- 
owners, under the sanction of a threat of removal, will at once ef- 
fect an object so desirable. 

Poaching in game and salmon is practised to some extent by 
young men in the higher parts of the parish, but does not prevail 
to such a degree as to influence the general habits of the people.

IV. — Industry. 
The number of acres of land which is either constantly or occa- 
sionally in tillage may be about 280. The number which remains 
constantly in pasture 71,600. The number that might be culti- 
vated with advantage does not probably exceed 50. There is no 
land in a state of undivided common. The number of acres un- 
der wood cannot be less than 70. The natural woods are not ju- 
diciously managed. No attention is bestowed on thinning them. 
The trees are cut, before they attain to a proper size, and they are 
much injured by breaking off the branches for fuel, a practice 
which the scarcity of that article renders common, and which occa- 
sions the early decay of the trees from the effects of the wet they 
receive by the wounds thus made. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land, taking that of 
the large farms at L. ] , and of the lots at L. 2 per acre, may be 
stated at L. 1, 10s. The average rent of pasture is reckoned at 
L. 2, 10s. for each cow, including provender for winter, and the 
rearing of a calf till he is a year old, or L. 1, 10s. for summer grass, 
15s. for wintering, and 5s. for the calf; 10s. is the usual charge 
for summer pasturing young cattle. The average rent paid for a 
ewe of the cross or Cheviot breeds is 2s. 6d., of the black-faced 
breed 2s., both being reckoned from the age of seven months. 

Wages. — Farm-servants are usually hired for the year; males at 
a wage of from L. 7 to L. 8 ; females L. 2, 10s., and fed in the 
house. Shepherds receive pasturage for 2 cows, and from 40 to 
60 sheep, 6 bolls of oatmeal, and a piece of land for potatoes. 
Day-labourers, Is. 6d. per day without victuals; dry-stone masons, 
2s. ; carpenters, 2s. 6d. per day. 

Prices. — The average price of Cheviot wool for the last seven 
years has been 9d. per pound smeared, or unsmeared, 1 Id. ; cross 
breed wool, 6id., or unsmeared SJd. ; black-faced, 5d., or un- 
smeared, 6d. per lb. ; of cheese, 7s. 6d. per stone of 24 lb. ; salt- 
butter, 16s. per do.; oatmeal, 18s. per boll of 140 lbs. ; potatoes, 
2s. 6d. per barrel of 32 gallons; oats, 10s. per do. ; barley, 14s. 
per do. Milk cows sell for about L. 7 ; horses for L. 12 : Cheviot 
sheep with lambs, or wedders, average L. 1 ; cross breed, 15s. 
black-faced, 12s. ; lambs of these several kinds, 7s. 6d., 6s., and 
4s. 6d. Of imported commodities, English coals are purchased at 
18s., Scotch at 14s. Foreign timber, 2s. 6d. per foot; Strathspey 
do. 2s. 3d. ; planted fir. Is. 6d. ; oak 2s. 6d. alder 8d. ; ash Is. lOd. 
Lime from Broadford, 9d. per boll.

The rates of mechanical work may be stated as follows : Mason- 
work, 9d. per yard ; plaster-work, 2d. per do. ; weaving from 4d. 
to 7d. per do.; netting, 6d. per pound; spinning, 2d. per do.; 
smith-work from 6d. to 9d. per lb., or 2d. per do., not including 
the iron ; sawing 3d. per 100 feet, or d. per. stave. A wooden 
plough, mounted, can be purchased for L. 2, 15. An iron one for 
L. 3, 10s. ; a cart for L. 5, a boat for L. 6. A barrel of nets for 
L. 4; ropes for do. 18s. ; a pair of oars, 7s., making do. 2s. 

Live Stock. — Of the several breeds of sheep above-mentioned, 
the four farms into which Mrs Stewart Mackenzie's property is di- 
vided, are stocked with the black-faced, as is also the farm of Ardin- 
toul, in Letterfearn, the Cheviot breed having been tried on the 
latter, and found not to thrive. A good deal of care has been be- 
stowed on the improvement of this kind of stock ; but there is room 
for further exertions. The property of Mr Lillingston is partly 
stocked with Cheviot, but chiefly with the produce of the black- 
faced ewe and the Cheviot ram. Much attention is bestowed up- 
on the improvement of this stock. There does not seem to 
be any speciality in the mode of management pursued, but such 
as results from the peculiarity of the climate and pasture. The 
loftiness of the mountains and the humidity of the climate render 
it indispensable to smear the whole flocks at the beginning of 
each winter. Tar and butter, or oil, are the materials used for 
this purpose. Any experiments that have hitherto been tried 
with other substances, have entirely failed. The casualties among 
the flocks are, on account of the ruggedness of the surface, 
the liability of the upland pastures to snow storms, the difficulty 
of tending the sheep, and the quantity of vermin which the caivTis 
and precipices harbour, necessarily very numerous. Much loss, 
arising from the cause last mentioned would be prevented, if the 
fox-hunters possessed the art of snaring and poisoning the de- 
structive animals ; and also if the people were prevented from in- 
dulging their excessive fondness for keeping multitudes of useless 
dogs, which, being half-starved at home, prey to a mischievous ex- 
tent upon the sheep and lambs. The disease called braxi/ is the 
source of serious losses, in the early part of the winter, and great 
numbers of lambs are often destroyed by stormy weather occurring 
at the time of their birth, especially among those of the Cheviot 
and cross breeds. During the last two springs the loss of sheep 
and lambs had been very great, in consequence of the unusual 
severity of these seasons. 

The breeds of black-cattle are the Ayrshire and the Highland. 



GLENSHEIL. 



205 



A few of the former are kept by the farmers for their milk ; but 
being less saleable, and requiring more pasture and provender than 
the native kind, they are not in general favour. The indigenous 
breed have long been celebrated for their symmetry and hardiness. 
A good many are still kept by the farmers on their low-lying lands; 
they are a source of considerable profit ; but there is not much 
attention bestowed on the preservation or improvement of the 
breed. 

Hushandry.—The tillage of the land is chiefly in the hands of 
the lotters and cottars. Each lot consists of from one to two acres 
of hanging ground, a great proportion of which is generally rock 
or bogs. A part of this patch is always planted with potatoes, and 
the rest sown with barley or oats. The manure used for potatoes 
is always sea-ware, the dung being reserved for the barley. The 
tillage is chiefly accomplished with the " crooked spade," an imple- 
ment well adapted for the cultivation of steep and stoney land. The 
manure is generally carried out, in creels on the back of a horse. 
On the large farms, implements of improved construction aroused, 
viz. ploughs, carts, and harrows. The great obstacles to improve- 
ment in this branch of husbandry, are the wetness of the climate, 
the want of leases, and of encouragement on the part of the pro- 
prietors. The lotters holding their lands only from year to year, 
having no meliorations allowed them, and having learnt by expe- 
rience that to improve their houses or lots, instead of producing 
any permanent advantage to themselves, is only holding out an in- 
ducement to others to ofl"er a few shillings of additional rent, and 
to deprive them of the fruit of their labour, are discouraged from 
attempting improvements which would add materially to their com- 
forts. On the large farms, the leases are also shorter than they 
ought to be, to encourage the improvement of stock. This is in part 
occasioned by the late violent fluctuations in the value of farm pro- 
duce, by which tenants are deterred from coming under permanent 
engagements, which a fall of prices might disable them from ful- 
filHng, and in part also, by the present unsettled state of the owner- 
ship of the lands. 

Herring Fisheri/.— The principal fishery is that of the herring. 
About twenty years since, the quantities of this fish caught in the 
loch were very considerable. Six and eight barrels in a night were 
then no uncommon capture for a boat equipped with four barrels 
of nets of 36 fathoms length by 5 deep ; but, of late years, the 
fishery has fallen off very much,— a single barrel of fish being now 
considered an excellent night's fishing. During the present sea- 



206 



noSS AND CROMARTY. 



son the fishing has been good. The boats, which are manned with 
from two to four men each, are generally about 16 feet keel, and 
rigged with a single lug-sail. The nets are restricted by law to the 
width of a square inch in the mesh, — an absurd regulation, not 
warranted by any experience of its utility, and most glaringly par- 
tial in its operation ; for while it prevents the capture of fish of a 
serviceable size, the catching of foul fish, i. e. of herrings full of 
milt and roe, is permitted without restriction ; and as the great 
quantities of fish taken on the east coast of Scotland are almost 
all in this condition, it is no extravagant assertion to say, that 
more injury is done to the breed of herring by one night's fishing 
there, than by the capture of all small herrings that have been 
killed on the west coast for a hundred years. The fish is either 
cured by the people themselves, or sold fresh to purchasers from 
the Clyde. The price of the cured fish per barrel is generally 
about L. 1, 4s. ; of the cran of the fresh fish, a measure which it 
is computed will fill a packed barrel, 16s. The chief obstacles 
to a more successful prosecution of this branch of industry are 
the smallness of the boats, occasioned by the want of capital, which 
prevents the fishermen from following the fish from loch to loch, 
and the want of timber of good quality at a moderate price. 

Salmon Fishei'y. — There is a salmon fishery carried on at each 
of the rivers flowing into the loch, which together pay a rent of 
L. 60. That of the Sheil belongs exclusively to the estate of Glen- 
sheil; the fishing of the Croe is divided between Mrs S. Macken- 
zie, and Thomas Mackenzie, Esq. of Applecross, the proprietor of 
the opposite lands. These fishings, in favourable seasons, are ex- 
tremely productive for the size of the rivers ; but these are of very 
uncertain occurrence, and the fishings lie under the permanent 
disadvantages of distance from market, lateness of productiveness, 
and expensiveness of management. The fish are chiefly caught 
with the stell-nei. Stake-nets have been tried, but nearly abandon- 
ed on account of their expensiveness. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, may be stated as under : 



Produce of all kinds of grain, - L. 240 

4390 bar. potatoes, &amp;c.at 2s. 6d. hlo

207 



The gross rental of the parish is L. 2600. 
There are no manufactures of any kind, except those domestic 
ones above-mentioned. There are no vessels of any burden belong- 
ing to the parish, but there is a frequent resort of vessels from the 
south, by which wool and herrings are exported, and smearing ma- 
terials, meal, salt, coals, iron, groceries, and cloths are imported. 
The freight of wool to Liverpool is from 4d. to 6d. per 24 lbs. ; of 
goods from thence 3s. the barrel bulk. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication.— The nearest market town is Inver- 
ness, which is distant from the inhabited portion of the parishbout 
60 miles. With this town, there is a communication by means of 
a parliamentary road constructed in 1815, through the valley of 
Glensheil to Glenmoristone. It runs for 18 miles through the 
parish, sending off a branch at Sheilhouse, where the river Shell 
enters the sea, westward to Glenelg and Skye, and another north- 
ward to Kintail and Lochalsh. At Sheilhouse, there is a sub-post- 
office connected with the post-office at Lochalsh, between which a 
foot post passes three times in the week. No public carriage runs 
on this road, but there is a constant resort of carriers to Inverness. 
There are two inns, one at Sheilhouse, and the other at Cluonie, 
 twelve miles distant to the south-east. This road, for some years 
after its construction, formed the principal communication between 
Inverness and Skye ; but its utility in this respect has been in a 
great measure superseded by the steam- vessels which now ply week- 
ly between that island and the Clyde. There is no road in Letter- 
fearn, where one is much required. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated near the 
eastern part of Letterfearn, and is distant about eight miles from 
the western extremity of the parish. Its situation, though equally 
contiguous to both the densely inhabited parts of the parish, viz. 
the middle of Letterfearn and the shores at the head of the loch, 
is not convenient for either, being about two miles and a-half dis- 
tant from the centre of each. It was built in 1758, being the first 
church that was erected in this parish, and is much decayed in the 

" Both ihe roacls here mentioned as lending from Sheilhouse to Skye are too sleep 
for wheel-carriages, each of thtm being carried over a hill about 1000 feet high. A road 
perfectly level miglit be t'onstriieted along the shore of Letterfearn, to join the Kyle 
Akin road to Broadford, near the former village. The distance and expense of con- 
struction would, it is believed, be less than either of the present roads Or a road 
from Sheilhouse to Ob-Inag might communicate with the Lochalsh road at 'I'otag 
ferry, which would be quite level, easy of construction, and save four miks of distance ; 
at the same time that it would greatly accommodate the inhabitants of the parish.

roof. It aflbrds accommodation for about 300 sitters. The seats 
were originally put up by the parishioners, but have been kept in 
repair by the heritors. No seat rents are exacted. 

The manse, which was built in 1834, is a commodious and sub- 
stantial building. 

The glebe is an arable one of 4 acres, with pasture for two cows 
and a horse, of about 20 acres in extent. Its yearly value is about 
L. 15. The stipend paid by the heritors is L. 132, 17s., — the 
deficiency required to i-aise it to L. 150 being paid by Government. 
There is no other church or chapel, nor any missionary or cate- 
chist in the parish. The whole inhabitants belong to the Esta- 
blished Church, with the exception of a few shepherds from the 
south of Scotland, who are seceders, and about 30 Roman Ca- 
tholics. The latter attend chajjel at Dornie, in the parish of Kin- 
tail, where there is a priest stationed. Divine worship is general- 
ly well attended. The average number of communicants is 72. 

Education. — There is a parochial school, situated at Letterfearn, 
in which Gaelic and English reading, writing, arithmetic and La- 
tin, are taught. The salary of the schoolmaster is L. 28 per an- 
num ; the school fees may amount to L. 2 more. The expense of 
education would not exceed 7s. per annum even if the fees were 
rigorously exacted, which is by no means the case. The number 
of young persons, between six and fifteen years, who cannot read or 
write, is 46. 

The people are generally much alive to the benefits of education. 
The whole children of the parish are not near enough to attend the 
school now mentioned. The parochial teacher is wretchedly ac- 
commodated. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving aid from the poor funds is 17, to each of whom the ave- 
rage sum allotted is 6s. per annum. There is no mode practised 
for raising the money thus expended, except the collections at the 
church door, which amount to about L. 3 annually, the interest of 
a fund of L. 70, and the fines imposed by the kirk-session on delin- 
quents. The precentor's, session-clerk's, and beadle's salaries, 
amount to L. 2, 10s. 

The poor do not often apply for parochial relief, except in cases 
of great necessity ; but in such cases they do not consider it as de- 
grading to apply for aid. 

Pairs. — The only fairs held in the parish are for the sale of 

black cattle, and occur at Whitsunday, July, and September. These 

4 



GLENSHEIL. 



209 



always take place on a Monday. The cattle are purchased by 
drovers from the south of Scotland, or from the neighbouring pa- 
rishes. The markets are held at Sheilhouse. Although a good 
deal of whisky is drunk on these occasions, there is not much 
drunkenness, and a fight rarely occurs. The practice of exposing 
pedlar's wares at these meetings, which has been lately introdu- 
ced, threatens, by attracting young females to them, to do injury to 
their morals. 

Inns. — Besides the inns above-mentioned, some of the poorer 
inhabitants are in the practice of retaihng spirits clandestinely, and, 
notwithstanding every endeavour to discourage it, this nuisance 
prevails to a pernicious extent. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used is peat. This is manufactured in 
the elevated situations, where alone moss occurs, and the carriage of 
it is a very laborious service, as it can only be transported in creels, 
sometimes on the backs of horses, but more frequently on those 
of men and even women. In the houses of the farmers, besides 
peats for the kitchen, some tons of coals are always procured for 
the other apartments. The firing required for a family of this 
class cannot be estimated at less than from L. 15 to L. 20 per 
annum. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The most striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical 
Account, consist in the introduction of the sheep husbandry, and 
of the lotting system. The moral and physical effects of these 
changes have been already noticed. A less equivocal benefit has 
been derived from the opening of the communication to the east- 
ward, and the more extensive diffusion of education. 

In all these respects, however, there is room for much improve- 
ment. The district of Letterfearn suffers much from the want of 
a road, the inhabitants being thereby in great measure deprived 
of the advantage which those of the eastern portion of the parish 
derive from the communication with Inverness, and subjected to 
much inconvenience otherwise. They complain, and not without 
reason, that though they have been taxed with road-money like 
the people of other parts of the country, their district has not 
shared in the benefit of its outlay. Both in attending the church 
and the school, the want of a road is much felt. Another evil 
demanding attention is the great and increasing poverty of the

lower class of the people, and its accompaniments, — the insufficient 
food, bad houses, and the baneful practice of illicit distillation. The 
most obvious cure for this unhappy state of things would be to in- 
crease the size of the lots; to proportion the rents to the produce of 
the land ; to grant leases to the more deserving. of the people, and 
to assist the others to leave the country. The present wretched po- 
verty-stricken population would thus be encouraged to build better 
houses, and cultivate their lands to better purpose, and enabled to 
provide themselves with such boats and tackle as should put it in 
their power to prosecute the herring fishery with a better prospect 
of success than at present. To these must be added, as a matter 
involving the moral as well as the physical welfare of the people, 
the providing greater facilities and more efficient means of educa- 
tion than at present exist. Two schools are indispensable, one of 
them situated at Letterfearn, and the other at the head of the 
loch, for the latter of which a permanent endowment for a teacher 
capable of teaching the ordinary branches of education, would be 
required. There is also need of some species of local police, to 
settle the disputes, and suppress the minor offences, which the 
presence of a resident magistracy would tend much to prevent.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. HECTOR BETHUNE, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Dingwall, consisting of the royal burgh of that 
name, with an inconsiderable tract of the surrounding country, is 
situated at the western extremity of the Frith of Cromarty. 

Name.— A diversity of opinion exists as to the origin of the name 
« Dingwall." The accomplished author of the former Statistical Ac- 
count derives it from "Diffma Vallis," words indicative of the richness 
and fertiUty of the low grounds, which constitute a great part of the 
parish. Others, with perhaps greater probability, consider it, like 
that of several of the towns on this coast, of Scandinavian origin, 
and refer it to a word expressive of its being the seat of justice. 
It is certainly not Celtic, as the Highlanders have not yet become

familiarized to it, but call the place Inneifeoran InverpefFery, 
marking its situation with regard to the small stream which gives 
its name to the well-known valley of StrathpefFer. 

Extent,boundaries. — The parish occupies an extent of lOf square 
miles. It forms nearly an oblong ; its northern extremity resting on 
the base of Ben Wyvis, whence, stretching in a direction almost south, 
it descends the fertile slope which forms the northern boundary of 
StrathpefFer, and crossing that valley where it opens into a rich 
flat, which extends along the shore to the end of the frith, — on 
which the town is built, and through which the stream called the 
PelFery winds its way to the sea, it cuts off a portion of the abrupt 
rising ground which separates Strathpeffer on the south from the 
valley of the Conan, and reaches that river at its junction with the 
frith. It is bounded on the north by Ben Wyvis ; on the east 
by the parish of Kiltearn; on the west and south-west by that of Fod- 
derty ; and on the south and south-east, by the sea, which, however, 
at ebb-tide recedes about three miles, leaving exposed a flat slimy 
strand, which detracts considerably from the interest with which 
the surrounding scenery is generally regarded. 

Topographical appearances. — The general aspect of the parish is 
exceedingly beautiful. The character of the sruface, — diversified by 
hill and valley; the appearance of high culture which it presents ; the 
abundance and luxuriance of the wood with which it is everywhere 
clothed ; and the frith, which at flood-tide appears a beautiful sheet 
of water completely enclosed by land, stretching eastward for about 
fourteen miles; together with the rugged outline of the mountains in 
the back-ground — combine in producing an effect which excites the 
admiration of strangers. The road from Inverness enters the pa- 
rish at the east end of the village of Maryburgh, — about a mile 
and three-fourths from the town. From this it passes eastward 
along the southern slope of the ridge, which runs between the town 
and the Conan. This ridge is crested by plantations of fir, its 
acclivity being lined out into fields intersected by hedge-rows with 
trees. On approaching the town it terminates abruptly, forming 
a steep bank called the green hill, which is covered by a planta- 
tion of hard wood. Along the base of this, the road runs, and 
enters the town flanked by a row of fine old trees. With the ex- 
ception of its situation, which is beautiful, and its rows of tall pop- 
lar trees, which give it rather an uncommon air, the town itself 
presents little of interest. It consists of a main street, about half 
a mile long, running nearly from east to west. From this a num- 



212 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



ber of small streets and lanes strike off at right angles, — an ar- 
rangement, which, in many instances, has the eflect of presenting 
the gables of the houses to the street. The houses are in gene- 
ral of two stories high. Both the church and the jail have 
steeples. The flat on which the town stands, which is scarcely 
four feet above the extreme flood-mark, is about half a mile wide. 
To the west of the town, however, it contracts to about half this 
width, — the southern ridge of StrathpefFer falling back at this 
point, and forming the recess occupied by the town. To the 
north of the town stands the hill of Tulloch, — a continuation of 
the northern ridge of StrathpeS"er, which rises to the height of 
about 800 feet. Its acclivity presents an aspect of uncommon 
luxuriance. It is occupied by several farms, which are ornament- 
ed by rov/s of fine old trees ; and by the beautiful grounds attach- 
ed to Tulloch Castle, which stands midway, about a mile from 
the town, 

" Embosomed deep in tufted trees." 

The summit of the hill is covered with wood, which is disposed in 
masses. Behind this hill, and distant about six miles, is seen 
Ben Wyvis, whose massy form afl'ords a complete shelter from the 
north and north-west.

mean pressure and temperature of the atmosphere in this parish, 
as ascertained by observations carefully made twice each day for the

The prevailing winds in this parish are the westerly and south- 
westerly, which blow during a great part of the year. From this 
quarter also we have our most boisterous and stormy weather. Our 
easterly winds are generally laden with fogs and damps from the 
German Ocean, and are frequently accompanied with rain. The 
coldest wind is from the north-west. 

The climate here is upon the whole pretty good. It is, how- 
ever, exceedingly variable, and subject to frequent showers, owing 
to the vicinity of Ben Wyvis, about which the clouds congregate, 
and which on this account serves the purpose of a natural barome- 
ter, from the position of the clouds with regard to which, changes 
can be predicted with tolerable accuracy. From the sheltered si- 
tuation of Dingwall, being almost surrounded by hills, it suffers 
little from cold, the winters being remarkably mild. But from its 
low situation, the nature of the soil, and its vicinity to the sea, it 
suffers considerably from damp, more so than the quantity of rain 
which falls as showed by the following table of observations for 
the last five years would indicate.

The climate, although variable, is decidedly salubrious. The 
parish is occasionally visited, in common with the district around, 
by the usual epidemics of, the country, — small-pox and measles, 
typhus and scarlet fever, &amp;c. ; but these occasions are by no means 



214

frequent, nor are those diseases distinguished here by any particu- 
lar virulence. The only complaint peculiar to this parish and dis- 
trict is not a little singular, and is deserving of notice, on account 
of the mode of cure, which is illustrative of the simplicity of the 
people, and worthy of being classed with the celebrated system which 
rendered Mesmer and Deslon so famous at Paris towards the close 
of last century. This notable disease, which is confined exclusive- 
ly to the lower orders, among whom it is of frequent occurrence, 
is supposed to consist in such a derangement of the bones of the 
chest, as impedes the action of the vital organs, accompanied by a 
variety of symptoms, such as slight pains about the breast and 
shoulders, difficulty of respiration, disinclination to labour, &amp;c. 
probably caused by a slight rheumatic affection. When any of 
these is felt, the person affected has immediate recourse to a man 
in the neighbourhood, distinguished for his skill in curing the dis- 
order, who, on seating the patient, proceeds to draw some hiero- 
glyphical figures on the ground, and to mutter a spell, in the course 
of which the fingers are carefully counted over, and the parts af- 
fected gently pressed and rubbed, — and thus, on receiving a few 
shillings for his trouble, generally succeeds in dislodging a disor- 
der whose seat is chiefly the imagination. 

Hydrography. — A considerable part of the parish to the south 
and east is washed by the Cromarty Frith, which, from this quar- 
ter, presents the appearance of a long narrow inland lake, its open- 
ing to the ocean being concealed by an intervening headland. The 
tide formerly advanced quite close to the town, but a canal, which 
was cut some years ago, has served the additional purpose of an 
embankment, by means of which a good deal of wet carse land, over 
which the sea formerly flowed, has been converted into fields. Ow- 
ing to the distance to which the tide recedes at ebb, the muddy na- 
ture of the bottom, and the freshness of the water from the influx of 
the Conan, and the other streams which discharge themselves into 
it here, the frith in this parish is very unproductive,— affording 
no fish, with the exception of a few flounders and some salmon, 
the latter of which are taken in yairs during the summer months. 

Perennial springs of clear wholesome water abound throughout 
the parish, from one or two of which, in the neighbourhood, a 
plentiful supply has lately been introduced into the town. Along 
the south side of the hill to the north of the town, there are mine- 
ral springs strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, issu- 
ing from\ dark-looking schistose rock, one of which, at a place 



DINGWALL. 



215 



called Dryine, is nearly as powerful, and contains the same ingre- 
dients, as the celebrated Strathpeffer spa. There is also within 
the town a strong chalybeate spring, which has lately attracted some 
attention as a powerful tonic. It rises from a depth of about 20 
feet below the surface, and was discovered by sinking a pump-well 
through the clay strata upon which the town is built. 

There are no lakes, properly speaking, within this parish, but a 
small isolated and now uninhabited district of it is situated on the 
border of a lake called Ousie, about two miles to the south-west 
of the town. It is nearly a square mile in extent, studded all over 
with richly wooded islets, which, with the bold outline of the blue 
hills around, give it rather an interesting appearance. It is, in 
other respects, only remarkable as the haunt of various aquatic 
birds, which resort to it for the purpose of breeding. 

The river Conan, which bounds this parish to the south, is a 
considerable stream. It has been estimated to discharge 70,000 
cubic feet per minute. Its course, which is from west to east, is 
about thirty-five miles, from its source in one of about a dozen 
mountain lakes which feed it, to its debouchement into the Cro- 
marty Frith. The Conan has few peculiarities. It is one of the 
Scotch rivers which furnish pearls. They are obtained in consi- 
derable quantity, and often of remarkable beauty, from the river- 
mussel  MyaMargaritifeja, Lin. Itproduces abundance of salmon, 
trout, &amp;c. and derives its name from the number of otters that for- 
merly infested it, but which have now become comparatively rare. 

Geology. — The prevailing rock in this parish is sandstone, in- 
termixed with conglomerate, being a part of the mass of old 
red sandstone and conglomerate which traverses this county 
from the Sutherland coast in a south-westerly direction, till it 
reaches the borders of Inverness-shire. This rock, which is stra- 
tified, dipping towards the south, and apparently resting conforma- 
bly on the gneiss and mica-slate of Ben Wyvis, passes occasionally, 
particularly in this and the neighbouring parish of Fodderty, into 
a dark-coloured calcareous schist, foliated and impregnated with bi- 
tuminous matter, producing the sulphureous mineral springs men- 
tioned. As it approaches its junction with this latter rock, the 
sandstone loses its characteristic colour, and becomes of a pale 
bluish gray, and, being of a smooth friable texture, is well adapted 
for the purposes of masonry. Over this, there is generally a pretty 
thick deposit of a species of coarse, gravelly, hght-coloured clay, 
containing boulders of granite, sienite and gneiss, occasionally

of considerable size ; and this is separated from the black vegeta- 
ble mould by a layer of yellow clay. The low flat, however, which 
forms the bottom of the valley, and which bears evident marks of 
having at some period been a part of the bed of the frith, con- 
sists of successive strata of blue clay, varying in feliickness, and alter- 
nating with sand or gravel containing quantities of sea shells. In this 
clay, whilst cutting a water-run some years ago, in the bottom of 
the strath within this parish, the vertebrse of a whale were found 
not far from the surface, in high preservation. And this succes- 
sion continues to the depth of about twenty-five feet, — beyond 
which, the writer is not aware of its having been penetrated. 

The general character of the soil in this parish is clayey, con- 
taining a greater or less admixture of vegetable matter. In the 
lower part, particularly in the neighbourhood of the town, it con- 
sists of a bed of black vegetable mould, varying in depth from 
one foot to two and a-half feet. Throughout the whole parish, 
it is remarkably fertile, and, being generally in a high state of cul- 
tivation, yields luxuriant crops. It is especially adapted, with the 
aid of lime, for the growth of wheat, affording in favourable sea- 
sons grain of this description, not inferoir to the finest por- 
duction of the Lothians. From the richness of the soil, however, 
the nature of the subsoil, which renders it exceedingly retentive 
of moisture, and from the extreme flatness which makes drainage 
difficult, if not in some cases impracticable, farming in the low part 
of the parish is somewhat precarious, — a wet season always proving 
uncommonly injurious, not only in retarding farming operations in 
spring and autumn, but in spoiling the grain, by causing the crops 
to lodge from over-luxuriance. 

Botany. — Of the plants most peculiarly attached to the soil perhaps 
the most characteristic is the poplar tree, which here rears its slender 
form to an unusual height. Numbers of these grow in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town, whose tall pyramidal shapes, disposed in rows, 
have an uncommonly picturesque effect. It would appear that in 
former times as it is at the present day Dingwall was famous for 
the growth of cabbages  as it was, and even is still known by the so- 
briquet Bailie a Chaille, kail-town, a title which was no doubt 
originally intended, by their wild and warlike neighbours, to con- 
vey a sarcasm on the effeminacy of the worthy burghers. 

Zoology. — The animals found in this parish, are such, generally, 
as are common to it with most parts of the Highlands. In addi- 
tion to the usual domestic quadrupeds, we have, either as perma-

nent inhabitants, or occasional visitants, the roe-deer, the red- 
deer is now rarely seen in the district, the rabbit, the common 
hare, the mountain hare {Lepus variabilis, the weasel, the ermine, 
the black, the brown, and the water rats, the shrew, the mole, 
the fox, the otter, and the seal. The wild-cat, the polecat, and 
the badger, which were formerly common, are now almost extinct 
in the district. 

From the sheltered situation of this parish, and the abundance 
of wood with which it is covered, it is a favourite resort of the 
feathered tribes, — few places of an equal extent affording so great 
a variety. There is abundance of game, consisting of partridges, 
grouse, black-game, and pheasants. These last have been only 
lately introduced, but have multiplied so amazingly fast as to have 
become, to the no small annoyance of the farmer, almost as nume- 
rous as partridges. Along with these the following are either sta- 
tionary residents, or periodical or occasional visitors.

The fishes found in this parish are chiefly those of the sahnon 
tribe, the frith as has been observed affording no sea-fishing. 
The Conan produces abundance of salmon of excellent quality. 
They begin to ascend the river to their spawning ground, about 
the middle of January; but comparatively few are taken be- 
fore the end of March or beginning of April, the Conan being 
later than some of the northern rivers. About the middle of 
June, the grilse make their appearance, and proceed up the ri- 
ver in great numbers, upwards of 100 of them having'repeatedly 
been taken at one sweep of the net. They continue to tra- 
vel upwards until towards the end of August or middle of Sep- 
tember, and return to the sea in February or March. There is

abundance of trout of various kinds. The salmon-trout appears 
about the beginning of June, and is taken in considerable quanti- 
ties throughout that and most of the succeeding months. Towards 
the end of July, the whitling known here by the name of finnock, 
enters the river in great numbers, and remains throughout the win- 
ter, and part of spring, affording excellent sport to the angler. 
The Conan also produces pike and eels, the latter of which com- 
mence their great annual migration from the sea early in June. 
II. — Civil History. 
Burgh.— The burgh of Dingwall is of considerable antiquity ; but, as 
there are no annals existing of its early history,— the only records 
now extant commencing at a period comparatively recent, we are 
left almost entirely to conjecture as to its origin and early_ condi- 
tion. It was probably originally, as its name would seem to indi- 
cate, a Danish settlement, which afterwards became one of the 
royal fortifications, which were erected along the coast for the 
purpose of defending the country against the incursions of that 
people. The charter of its erection into a Royal Burgh was 
granted in 1227, by Alexander II., and dated 6th February, and 
13th of his reign. By this he gave it title to " omnes libertates et 
liberas consuetudines quas burgenses nostri de Inverness et in eo 
manentes habent." This was subsequently confirmed and em- 
bodied in a charter of James IV., dated 12th February 1497, and 
again ratified by a charter of James VL, dated 9th February 
15S7. 

Dingwall would seem, in the course of its history, to have suf- 
fered various changes of fortune, and to have passed through dif- 
ferent stages of prosperity and decline. Several circumstances 
would seem to indicate that the town was once much more extensive 
than it is at present. Pavements have been dug up, and traces of 
building discoveredrunningin a south-easterly direction, and consi- 
derably beyond the present limits of the town. Being the principal 
residence of the powerful Earls of Ross, who acted so conspicu- 
ous a part in the early history of Scotland, and doubtless depend- 
ing much on their protection and bounty, it is natural to suppose 
that it must have participated to a certain degree in the fortunes 
of that family. Accordingly, we find, that on the extinction of the 
earldom by forfeiture in 1476, the affairs of the burgh suffered a 
rapid decline, from which it did not for a long time recover, — the 
inhabitants loudly complaining that their trade had almost totally 
disappeared, not only from a want of the requisite capital for fo-

reign commerce, but because their inland traffic was intercepted 
on all sides by the burghs of barony which were springing up 
around, under the patronage of the lesser proprietors, who were 
now rising in importance. 

The burgh at one time possessed a considerable extent of pro- 
perty, but through the rapacity or mismanagement of its function- 
aries, this was, even so early as towards the end of the seventeenth 
century, almost wholly alienated,— being either sold or feued out 
for a merely nominal equivalent. So that the heritors and inha- 
bitants were reduced to the necessity of submitting to a personal 

stent or impost, to maintain the " liberty and credit of the town" 

a state of things which could not have been favourable towards ef- 
fecting works of public improvement. The necessity for some of 
these, about this period, may be inferred from a report presented in 
1733 to the town-council of Inverness, by certain of their number 
who had been commissioned to explore this " terra incognita." 
" There was," it says, " no prison, but there was a lake close to 
the town, which kept the people from church and market for want 
of a bridge." It further states, that there was no trade in the 
town, but that there were one or two inclined to carry on trade 
if they had a harbour." Inverness burgh records. For some 
time after this, we find no occurrence worthy of notice. The pub- 
Uc tranquillity was occasionally affected by the feuds of the sur- 
rounding clans, and when any of the hostile parties met, as they 
occasionally did at fairs, affrays frequently ensued, which some- 
times ended in bloodshed. In one of these, in 1740, the lady of 
the provost was killed. But various circumstances, shortly after 
this, tended to improve the condition of the place. Its trade was 
extending in proportion as the surrounding country grew in agri- 
cultural importance, which the altered habits of the Highlanders 
subsequently to 1745, tended to promote. Under a better and 
purer management, the revenue arising from its remaining property 
was increased. Bridges were built, — a jail was erected, the streets 
were paved, and water introduced into the town. And the loss of 
the common lands was in some measure compensated by their ra- 
pid conversion from swamps and pasture lands, to fertile fields and 
thriving plantations, a change at once beneficial and ornamental. 
In more recent times, the cutting of a canal began in 1815, and was 
completed in 1817, by which vessels of considerable burthen are 
brought into the immediate vicinity of the town. The establish- 
ment of a branch bank in 1828, — the high state of culture to

which the surrounding country has been brought, — the constant 
and easy communication with an extensive and populous district,— 
together with several other circumstanced of a less obvious charac- 
ter, have contributed to increase considerably, the commercial and 
political importance of Dingwall. 

Antiquities. — At the east end of the town may still be seen part of 
the ruins of what once was the chief residence of the Earls of Ross. 
This family, which occupied a distinguished rank among the Scottish 
barons, possessed a great part of the landed property of this dis- 
trict, several of the most considerable proprietors around holding 
their lands by charter from them dated " apud castrum nostrum 
de Dingwall." This building, which would seem to have been a 
regular fortification, occupying an area of about half an acre, was 
well situated for defence. It stood quite close to the shore, the 
deep shmy channel of the PefFery into which the sea flowed wind- 
ing about two of its sides, and a level plain of considerable ex- 
tent surrounding it on the other. A small fragment of the castle 
wall is all that now remains of it, but even this is capable of giving 
some idea of the solidity and massive proportions of the original 
structure. The fosse, which surrounded it, may still be traced ; 
and a regular glacis is plainly visible. After the forfeiture of the 
Earl, the proprietor of the estate of Tulloch was appointed here- 
ditary constable of the castle, with a salary of 20 merks, or L.l, 
2s. 22 d. Sterling, Its site is now occupied by a castellated build- 
ing, erected by a naval gentleman, a native of the place, who ob- 
tained the land in feu, and who, by the improvements which he has 
effected, has contributed much to the ornament of the town. 

Near the church stands an obelisk, which, although of no great 
antiquity, attracts the notice of all travellers. It is erected on an 
artificial mound, occupying about two-thirds of an acre. The obe- 
lisk is 6 feet square at the base, and rises in a pyramidal form, to 
the height of 57 feet. It was erected by George first Earl of Cro- 
marty, Secretary of State for Scotland, in the reign of Queen Anne, 
and was intended to ornament and distinguish this spot, which he 
designed to be the family burying-place. 

Towards the north end of the parish, there are the remains of a 
Druidical temple; and there are many similar remains in the neigh- 
bourhood. It stands on a bare moor, — all that now remains of it be- 

 The tenure by which some of these are held is somewhat singular. One pro- 
prietor in the neighbourhood is bound by his charter to deposit yearly, at the castle 
wall, a stipulated quantity o peals.

ing the upright stones of the inner circle, — those of the outer circle, 
which may still be distinctly traced in the sward, having been re- 
moved to build a march-dike in the vicinity. 

III. — Population. 

For the reasons above assigned, it is inipossible now, with 
any accuracy, to ascertain the ancient state of the population 
of this parish, which would appear to have been subject to consi- 
derable fluctuation, both in circumstances and numerical amount. 

The amount of the population since the commencement of the 
Parliamentary census has been as follows : 

Males, Females. 

In 1801 it was 1418 619 799 

1811 1300 647 853 

1821 2031 930 1101 

1831 2139 980 1139 

This gradual increase of population is satisfactorily accounted 
for by the growing habits of attention to cleanliness and health, 
apparent among the people, — the universal use of vaccination, — and 
the occasional influx of strangers, particularly the settlement here 
of the staff of the Ross-shire militia in 1816. The increase since 
1821, as indicated above, is considerably less than it would have 
been, owing to the extent to which emigration has been carried on 
during the last few years ; — the average number of persons who 
have left this parish for the Canadas, during that period, being not 
much below twenty, annually. A considerable number also of 
young men leave this parish yearly, in quest of employment in the 
south. 

The number of the population residing in the burgh is 17 15, be- 
ing aboutfour-fifthsof the whole. There are no villages in the parish. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years is . 30 

That of marriages for the same period . • 

There is no register of deaths kept in the parish. 

The number of individuals and families of independent fortune residing in the 

parish is about . • • ' n j' j-

The people of this parish are not remarkable for any peculiarity 
in their personal appearance. 

The number of insane persons is 2 ; of fatuous 6 ; of blind 1 ; 
and of deaf and dumb 1. 

Gaelic is still the language of the lower orders of the people, 
although it has been sensibly declining within the last twenty 
years, and promises at no very distant period to be completely sup- 
planted by the English, which is understood by all, and tolerably 



DINGWALL. 



223 



well spoken by most of the inhabitants. It has become the lan- 
guage of ordinary conversation among the young, Gaelic being 
now rarely heard on the play ground. Still the older members of the 
community are strongly attached to it, and public worship is every 
Sabbath performed in it, at which a large proportion of the people 
attend. 

There are no popular customs peculiar to this parish worthy of 
notice. The taste for amusements would seem to be declining 
here ; even the Christmas and Newyear's shinty matches, in which 
but recently, both old and young used to indulge with eager inte- 
rest, are now abandoned, and exchanged, it is to be feared, in many 
instances, for pastimes of a less equivocal character. 

The people generally are simple, industrious, and temperate in 
their habits, rather cheerful in their dispositions, and affable in 
their manners and address. Although by no means filthy in their 
persons, they are far from remarkable for cleanliness in their dwell- 
ings and domestic arrangements. But a marked change in this 
respect is now taking place. More regard is now paid to neatness, 
at least in the exterior of their houses ; and the dunghill, which 
used to disfigure the approach to them, is now pretty generally 
giving place to a flower-plot or shrubbery. The staple articles 
of food among the peasantry are potatoes and herrings, which, with 
oatmeal, form the subsistence of the poorer classes. Fresh fish, 
with which the market here is abundantly supplied at particular 
seasons of the year, comes on these occasions within the reach of 
their limited funds, and supplies them with a wholesome and 
agreeable variety. But the standard of living is exceedingly low, 
— butcher meat being to the lower orders a luxury in which they 
seldom indulge. Still, however, the people are social and con- 
tented, and enjoy the comforts of society in a higher degree than 
their slender circumstances would indicate. 

Their intellectual character stands as high as that of most peo- 
ple who labour under the disadvantage of using the Gaelic as 
their vernacular tongue, in which there existed nothing, at least 
until recently, deserving the name of literature. Most of them, it 
is true, were taught to read and write English, but they think in 
Gaelic, which renders these acquisitions of comparatively little 
use to them. But although thus necessarily, in a great measure, 
strangers to the intelligence acquired by reading, and consequent- 
ly a good deal influenced by the narrow prejudices inseparable 
from Ignorance, they are naturally shrewd and observant, sagacious 



224 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



in the management of their affairs, and not altogether destitute of 
that thoughtful and imaginative cast of mind characteristic of High- 
landers. 

Their character for morality is upon the whole creditable. Mak- 
ing due allowance for exceptions, they are honest, sober, and 
peaceable, good citizens, and loyal subjects. The number of ha- 
bitual drunkards in the place is small, bearing no proportion to 
the amount of temptation to that vice presented by the great num- 
ber of public-houses. Still the tone of their morality is perhaps 
rather strict than high. 

With regard to religion, in so far at least as externals are con- 
cerned, they are decidedly a religious people ; having great re- 
verence for sacred things, evincing a laudable diligence 'in attend- 
ing the means of religious instruction, and in general maintaining 
a suitable conduct, with those exceptions which must occur in every 
society. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

The number of acres in this parish, either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, 

2388 

The'number which have never been cultivated, but remain in pasture is . 3168 

There is very little of this capable of being added to the cul- 
tivated land of the parish with any prospect of remuneration. It 
chiefly consists of some hill pasture, and moorland lying at the 
northern extremity of the parish. But there is an extent of about 
200 acres within the parish recoverable from the sea, and capable 
of being very profitably improved. It consists of a flat bay, with 
a bottom composed of mud, covered only at high water, which 
might be easily rendered capable of yielding excellent crops ; all 
that is requisite being to exclude the sea, which might easily be 
eS"ected by means of an embankment, owing to the shallowness of 
the water. A method has been suggested by which this land 
might be recovered at a very inconsiderable expense, which is 
worthy of notice. It is found that each tide carries along with it 
a quantity of the slime of which the shore is chiefly composed for 
a considerable distance, which at present it washes off" again by 
its action as it recedes. But if a row of pretty closely set piles 
were so placed as to prevent its being carried away, the mud would 
not only accumulate about the piles which might be multiplied 
from time to time, as an increase of height or solidity was required, 
so as in time to form an embankment, but a deposit would gra- 
dually go on which would have the additional advantage of raising 



DINGWALL. 



225 



the whole surface. That this would actually be the result is 
proved by the fact, that within a yair, which was erected a few 
years ago in the neighbourhood, and which could but partially 
answer the purpose of the piles, a bed of mud of considerable 
depth has already been deposited. And this is further confirmed 
by the rapidity with which mud accumulates in those parts of the 
canal which are not exposed to the action of the current. 

There are no common lands in the parish. 

There are 1385 acres covered with plantations of fir, larch, and 
hard-wood, chiefly the first, of all ages, — all very thriving, and 
in general well attended to. But besides this, there is a great 
deal of very fine wood, consisting of beech, elm, oak, ash, syca- 
more, &amp;c. dispersed all over the parish in the form of clumps, 
rows, and borders. Tulloch, the residence of the principal pro- 
prietor, is very richly wooded, which is disposed with great taste, 
And the fields all over the parish are edged with .rows of trees, 
— the disadvantage of which to the farmer is compensated to the 
public in the luxuriant and picturesque appearance which they 
impart to the country. 

The average rent of arable land in the parish is about L. 2 per 
acre. The lands around the town, which are of superior quality, 
are very highly rented, some as high as L. 4, lOs. per acre. 

The average rent of grazing here is at the rent of L. 1 per ox 
or cow, and 3s. per sheep during the year. 

The usual rate of wages for farm-servants is from L. 7 to L. 8 
in money, 7 bolls of meal, a quarter of an acre of potatoes, and a 
free. house and garden, worth in all about L. 20 per annum. La- 
bourers only occasionally employed are paid at the rate of about 
7s. 6d. a-week ; and country artisans at about 9s. The average 
rate of mason work for some years past is from L. 1, 16s., to L. 2 
per rood, journeymen being paid at the average rate of 12s. a-week. 
Carpenters are paid from 10s. to 12s. a-week ; slaters about 12s. — 
painters from 12s. to 16s. But work of all kinds is done now by 
estimate, and the rate of wages varies according to the demand, 
and the qualification of the workman. 

The number of sheep and cattle bred in this parish is inconsi- 
derable ; the grazing, which is well sheltered by wood, being ge- 
nerally let as wintering for sheep reared in the more mountainous 
and exposed parts of the country, and as summer grazing for the 
black-cattle reared by the farmers and cottars around, which are 
grazed at so much per head. The few sheep produced in the

parish, which were formerly the common black-faced breed of the 
country, are now Cheviot of the most approved breed. The cattle 
are generally of the Highland stamp, with the exception of some 
Ayrshire cows, recently introduced. The horses on all the larger 
farms are Clydesdale, of a superior caste. The cottars still use 
the small garrons of the country. 

The husbandry pursued in the parish is of a very high character. 
The neatness, extent, and regularity of the fields, and the general 
appearance of high culture which the farms present, frequently ex- 
cites the surprize of strangers who visit the Highlands for the first 
time ; while the superior quality of the produce secures for it the 
highest prices in the markets. The implements used are of the 
most approved description, comprising most of the modern improve- 
ments. The systems of cropping practised are the following, 

chiefly the first : 

1st. Six-course rotation for best loam or clay lands: 1. fallow 
manured, or turnips with manure or bone-dust; 2. wheat or 
barley; 3. hay; 4. oats; 5. potatoes, pease, or beans manured; 
6. wheat.— 2d. Five- course rotation for light or gravelly land: 
1. turnips ; 2. barley or wheat occasionally ; 3. hay ; 4. pasture; 
5. oats, or wheat seldom.— 3d. Seven-course rotation for inferior 
loam or clay : 1. fallow or turnips ; 2. wheat or barley ; 3. hay ; 
4. pasture ;'5. oats ; 6. beans or potatoes ; 7. wheat. 

Since the date of the former Statistical Account, a great pro- 
portion of the arable land of the parish has been brought mto a 
state of culture. A considerable part of this was reclamied from 
the sea. It consisted of carse lands lying to the south and east 
of the town, over which the sea flowed at high water. In the im- 
provement of this, all that was requisite was to exclude the sea by 
means of embankments which has been eff-ectually done, and to 
level the surface, as the want of fall, and the nature of the sub- 
soil a stiff- clay precluded drainage. By the aid of lime and 
manure, these lands have been brought into a state of great pro- 
ductiveness. Another extensive improvement was the drainage 
and culture of the low part of Strathpeff-er, lying within this pa- 
rish, consisting of a swampy morass overgrown by stunted alder 
trees, and commonly called the bog. Through this a channel was 
cut for the Peffery, sufficiently deep to aflord a fall for drainage, 
bv a judicious use of which, and by trenching and levelling the sur- 
face this, which was formerly of so little value as to be used as a 
common grazing, has become one of the finest farms ,n the pansh. 



DINGWALL. 



227 



These improvements were chiefly effected by the tenants who 
hold their lands on leases of nineteen or twenty-one years; and 
this demonstrates the great advantage resulting, not only to the 
proprietor, but to society generally, from such leases as secure to 
the occupier the fruits of his enterprize or skill. The lands about 
town are generally held on leases of five years, the proprietor be- 
ing unwilling to grant them for longer terms, as they might prove 
obstacles to improvements, and as the value of land is there more 
fluctuating. 

The farm-buildings throughout the parish are in good repair. 
They are in general substantial and commodious. The enclosures 
are chiefly sunk fences and hedges, the latter of which are very 
badly kept. 

The chief obstacles to improvement on the part of the farmer 
here, arise from the frequent inability of the proprietor, owing to 
circumstances connected with the law of entail, to render the te- 
nant any assistance or encouragement in times of depression. The 
best remedy for this would undoubtedly be the conversion of 
money into grain rents, which would render the tenant independent 
to a great degree of fluctuation in the market prices. 

There are three quarries in the parish ; one of these, which 
is situated about one-fourth of a mile from the town, is the proper- 
ty of the public. It is a hard gray sandstone of good quality ; but 
the labour and expense of excavating it are very great, owing to the 
depth of clay and breccia by which it is covered. The other two, 
which are private property, are of a fine light-blue colour, afford- 
ing stone fit for all kinds of work, and susceptible of a very fine 
polish. It has, however, one disadvantage ; there is a small ad- 
mixture of iron pyrites, upon which the rain in time operates, and 
stains in a very ugly manner the contiguous stones. 

There are no fisheries in this parish, with the exception of a 
stell salmon-fishing in the Conan, one-third of which belongs to 
the common good of the burgh, and from which it derives an ave- 
rage revenue of L. 90. There is also belonging to the town a yair 
fishing in the frith, which pays a trifling rent, but, owing to mal- 
construction or some other cause, it has been for a few years past 
very unproductive. 

The average gross amount of raw produce raised in the parish, 
which, owing to a variety of circumstances it would be almost im- 
possible to ascertain with accuracy, may be approximated thus :

Navigation. — There are but two small vessels belonging to this 
place. They were built here, and are employed in the coast trade. 
But, besides these, the port is frequented by vessels of different 
descriptions, which supply the district with lime, coal, &amp;c. 

Associations.— The " Farmers' Society for Wester Ross," which 
has for its object the promotion of agriculture and its interests in 
this district, holds its quarterly meetings at Dingwall. Of this so- 
ciety all the principal farmers, and most of the landed proprietors 
around, are members. At these meetings the business consists in 
reading essays, detailing experiments, describing new inventions or 
improvements on the implements of husbandry, and in deliberating 
on the general interests of agriculture. The influence of this so- 
ciety has been considerable in improving stock, by promoting local 
exhibitions, &amp;c. in bringing modern discoveries in the theory or 
practice of farming into general notice"; and in fostering feelings of 
kindliness and intimacy, such as should ever subsist between land- 
lord and tenant. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The burgh of Dingwall contains a population of 1715, amount- 
ing to about four- fifths of the whole population of the parish. 

Having no manufactures, the trade of Dingwall is very limited, 
being confined, on the one hand, to the importation of those various 
articles of merchandise which are required for the supply of the 
surrounding country ; and, on the other, to the exportation of corn, 
timber, bark, and such other country produce as can be convenient- 
ly procured to form a freight for the vessels which bring hither coal, 
lime, and other commodities. 



DINGWALL. 229 

Tlie chartered constitution of the burgh consists in a council of 
fifteen members, including- a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, 
and a treasurer. These, by the late burgh Reform Act, are elect- 
ed from time to time by those residing within the royalty, who pos- 
sess or rent property to the yearly value of L. 10 or upwards. The 
number of persons possessing this qualification here is about 100. 
Dingwall is one of the northern district of burghs that send a joint 
member to Parliament. 

The police of the place is very defective, owing to the limited 
state of the public funds. For although it possesses an average 
revenue of L. 273, 7s. 2d. Sterling, arising from the superiority of 
certain lands held iji feu of the burgh, — the fishings in the river 
Conan, &amp;c. and the rent of a small residue of the public lands, still 
the interest of debts to a large amount, contracted chiefly in a te - 
dious law-suit with the Honourable Mrs Hay M'Kenzie of Cro- 
marty, regarding possession of part of the Conan fishings, together 
with the payment of public burdens, leave little to meet the ex- 
pense of an efficient system of police, and of cleaning, lighting, or 
improving the town. 

The freedom of the town, which is an indispensable qualifica- 
tion to merchants commencing business here, costs from L. 5 to 
L. 15, according to the probable extent of the business to be car- 
ried on. 

Means of Communication. — Thei'e is the greatest facility of com- 
munication between Dingwall and all parts of the country. The 
roads in all directions are surpassed by none in the kingdom. The 
mail-coach passes and repasses daily through the town, and in 
summer there are two additional daily coaches, one betwixt Ding- 
wall and Inverness by the ferry of Kessock, a distance of thirteen 
miles. And the other twice each day between Dingwall and the 
Strathpeffer spaw, now a place of considerable resort, distant four 
miles and a-half. Weekly steam-boats from Edinburgh, and every 
second week from London, call at Invergordon, in this frith, distant 
only fourteen miles ; and the town furnishes four post-chaises and six 
g'gs. 

There is a tolerably good harbour quite close to the town, con- 
sisting of a canal formed in the years 1815-17, at an expense of 
L. 4365. The management of it is vested by an Act of Parlia- 
ment passed in 1824 in a board of commissioners, a great ma- 
jority of whom consist of the magistrates of the town. The ave- 
rage revenue arising from it is about L. 130, which is not more 
than sufficient to keep it in repair. The advantages resulting from

this canal must be obvious, for by means of it, vessels of con- 
siderable burden are brought into the immediate vicinity of the 
town, which, without it, owing to the shallowness of the frith, must 
have remained at a distance ; and, from the muddy nature of the 
shore, almost inaccessible. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated on the north 
side of the town, and is exceedingly convenient to the whole po- 
pulation, being almost in the centre of the parish. It was built 
in 1801. Although plain in its exterior, within it is remarkably 
neat and commodious, and is in excellent repair. It affords seat- 
room for about 800. From the circumstance, that the Gaehcand 
English portions of the population form two almost distinct con- 
gregations nearly equally numerous, this apparently deficient ac- 
commodation is ample. For the same cause also the poorer clas- 
ses, who belong to the Gaelic congregation, enjoy the privilege of 
church accommodation free of expense ; for the wealthier part of 
the community, by whom seats are rented, attend, with few excep- 
tions, the English service only, and thus all the seats are open to 
the unrestricted access of any who may choose to occupy them 
during the Gaelic service. 

The manse was built in the year 1791, — and had an addition 
made to it in 1825. It is sufficiently commodious, and is at pre- 
sent in good repair. The glebe, which is a mile distant from town, 
consists of about ten acres,— all arable, and of superior quality. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, paid one-half in meal, and the other 
in barley. 

There is a catechist employed in the parish, who receives about 
L. 15 per annum for his services. This sum is paid partly by the 
inhabitants, who subscribe for the purpose, and partly by the 
kirk-session, who allow him L. 5 for visiting the poor. 

There are no Dissenting or Secession places of worship in the 
parish, but there is an Episcopalian chapel, in which service is per- 
formed every alternate Sabbath. 

The whole population of the parish are members of the Esta- 
blished Church, with the exception of from 40 to 50 Episcopa- 
lians, and about a dozen Wesleyian Methodists,— strangers con- 
nected with the staff of the Ross-shire militia, which is stationed 

here. . 

The people are regular in their attendance on divme worship. 

The average number , of communicants is 140. 

The only religious or charitable society established in the pa- 



DINGWALL. 



231 



rish, is " the Dingwall Ladies' Association for Missionary and Re- 
ligious purposes," which meets annually with the view of collect- 
ing funds in aid of the objects of the association. But the north- 
ern Missionary Society holds one of its annual meetings at Ding- 
wall. The average amount collected by these annually is about 
L. 65 ; the receipts of the latter generally amounting to about 
L. 50. 

The yearly average amount of church collections for religious 
and charitable purposes is about L. 60. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish. One of these 
is the parochial school, — none of the others is endowed. One, 
an infant school, was erected in 1832, by private subscription, and 
is still supported by the same means. The other three, of which 
one is a female seminary, are private, — the school fees being the 
sole emolument of the teacher. At these the ordinary branches 
of education are taught, viz. reading, writing, arithmetic, English 
grammar, and geography ; in addition to which, at the parochial 
school, mathematics, the Latin and Greek classics, French, &amp;c. 
are taught. 

Li addition to those mentioned, there is a Sabbath school in 
the parish, at which from 200 to 300 children generally attend. 
•It meets in church, and is taught on Gall's system, by a number 
of benevolent individuals of both sexes, under the superintend- 
ence of the minister. 

The salary of the parochial teacher is the maximum, amounting 
to L. 34, 4s. 4d. The average annual amount of school fees is 
about L. 40. The teacher is provided with a house and garden, 
— that occupied by him at present is rented for that purpose by 
the heritors, — the house appropriated to the schoolmaster having 
fallen into disrepair. 

The general expense of education is as follows ; viz. for Eng- 
lish reading, 6s. per annum ; do. and writing, 8s. ; do. do. and 
arithmetic, 12s. ; Latin or Greek L.l, 4s. &amp;c. 

The people in general are sufficiently alive to the advantages 
of education, and, with few exceptions, avail themselves of the . fa- 
cilities afforded them of giving to their families at least an elemen- 
tary education. The low rate of fees places this within the reach 
of all who exercise ordinary industry and prudence ; and that the 
children of the poorest may not be excluded from its blessings, the 
kirk-session maintain at school twenty of the most destitute chil- 
dren out of the funds at their disposal.

Literature — It is to be regretted that there is no pubHc Hbrary 
or reading-room, nor any Uterary or scientific society in this pa- 
rish. There was a subscription library estabhshed here some time 
ago, but, owing to pubhc indifference, the project failed. The 
reason probably is, that the wealthier and more influential part of 
the community, which comprises almost the whole of its literary 
taste are generally possessed of private libraries, and supply them- 
selves with newspapers and periodicals. Of the former, about forty- 
seven come to the parish, of which about seven are daily papers ; 
and of the latter, the number of copies of the larger magazines and 
reviews which come to the parish is twenty-eight, and of the smal- 
ler class, 136. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of poor re- 
ceiving regular parochial relief is about 100 ; whose allowances 
vary from 5s. to L. 1 yearly. Besides these, a considerable sum 
is annually expended in relieving contingent cases of necessity. 

The average amount of poor's funds is L. 100 ; of which about 
L. 50 are derived from church collections. The remaining L. 50 
consists of the interest of various sums, amounting to L. 1000, mor- 
tified at different periods for the behoof of the poor. Of this, 
L. 700 was left by one of the proprietors of the estate of TuUocb, 
and L. 100 by the late Bailie Murdo Mackenzie of this place. The 
remainder, consisting of cash at the disposal of the kirk-session, 
has been lent out on heritable security, for all which five per cent, 
interest is paid. 

There is no regular assessment here for the poor, but claims for 
parochial relief do occasionally occur which the ordinary resources 
of the parish are incapable of meeting, and which compel recourse 
to a measure which ought always to be resorted to with caution, on 
account of its obvious tendency to encourage idleness, and to de- 
stroy that feeling of independence which shrinks from parochial re- 
lief, which still exists to a considerable degree here, and which is 
one of the strongest stimuli to habits of industry and economy. 

Prisons. — There is a jail in the burgh, which, however, has been 
disused for a year or two past, owing to its great insecurity. It 
has recently undergone a temporary repair, and is about to be 
again employed as a place of confinement. Four-fifths of the pri- 
soners confined in it when in use were committed for offences 
against the excise laws. These, the Highlanders, a simple people, 
unskilled in nice distinctions, were accustomed to view as oppres- 
sive restrictions on a practice to which habit had given them the 



DINGWALL 



233 



feeling of a legal right. The infringement of them they therefore 
did not regard as criminal, and imprisonment, on account of it, 
they considered as rather a misfortune than a disgrace. But 
smuggling is now, happily for the peace and comfort of the people, 
almost wholly at an end ; so that our jail will henceforth, it is 
hoped, be occupied by those only whose offences are of so unequi- 
vocal a criminality as that the severity of their punishment may not 
be aggravated by a doubt of its justice. The government of the 
jail was extremely defective. Indeed, the poverty of accommoda- 
tion, and the character of the building, which permitted the pri- 
soners to hold free and constant intercourse with the public, pre- 
cluded anything like a proper system of discipline, while the damp 
and ill-ventilated cells into which many were necessarily crowded, 
seldom failed in affecting the most robust constitutions. A new 
county jail is at present iu contemplation, of which Dingwall, as 
the county town, and the most centrical situation, is generally ex- 
pected to be the site. 

Fairs. — There are three annual fairs held in the parish, at 
which all sorts of commodities are vended. At these the country 
people assemble in great numbers, partly because they still have 
somewhat of the character of festivals, which the term " feil" in 
Gaelic imports, but chiefly owing to the force of confirmed habit, 
since all that can be purchased at these fairs may be had quite as 
conveniently in town at any time. 

Inns, Sfc. — In addition to the two principal inns, which are com- 
modious and well kept houses, there are in the parish at present 
sixteen licensed public-houses. The number a few years ago was 
considerably greater, but the authorities, sensible of their demo- 
ralizing tendency, have been gradually restricting the number, and 
have done much to counteract their influence, by maintaining 
over them a strict superintendence. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in the parish is chiefly coal, of which 
there is always an abundant supply. Peats are also a good deal 
used. They are brought from the neighbouring parish of Fod- 
derty, in small, rung carts, and sold at a shilling or fifteenpence per 
load. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the time of the last Statistical Account this parish has un- 
dergone considerable change, chiefly in respect of its productive 
capabilities, the condition and appearance of the town, and the 
multiplied facilities of communication with all parts of the king- 



234 



ROSS AND CUOMAUTY. 



dom. Since that period a great part of the parish, formerly waste, 
has been brought into culture, and that previously in cultivation 
greatly improved. At that time the land was principally occupied 
by small farmers and crofters, whose notions of husbandry were ex- 
tremely limited ; now it is laid out in large farms, where the most 
approved theories of farming are practically exemplified. Then 
the implements used were of the most primitive description, Scots 
ploughs, rung carts, kallachies, &amp;c., now these, which are not to be 
seen at all, have been supplanted by metallic ploughs, harrows and 
rollers, frame carts, &amp;c. &amp;c. These changes have not left much 
to be added to the productive capacity of the parish. Still it 
would be too much to say that this had attained its maximum. 
Some land, as has been mentioned, still remains to be reclaimed, 
and farther improvements in agriculture may still do much in de- 
veloping the latent energies of the soil. 

In tliese changes also the town has shared in a similar degree. 
Since that time it has been greatly extended, and the character 
of the buildings, both in respect of size and comfort, very much 
improved. Most of the better sort of houses have been built with- 
in the last twenty years, and several excellent houses are at pre- 
sent in the course of erection. Shops of all kinds have multiplied 
to such a degree as to furnish every kind of goods, and to preclude 
the necessity which existed, even within the last twenty years, of 
sending to Inverness for all but the most common commodities. 
The access to the town has been greatly improved, especially to- 
wards the north, in which direction a new street has been opened. 
A new road has also been made leading eastward to the shore. 
A harbour has been formed, — a bank has been established, — new 
apparatus has been constructed for conveying water into the town, 
— the pavement of the streets has been renewed, and more atten- 
tion than formerly is now paid to keeping them clean. Light is 
still a desideratum. 

Another important change, in the benefits of which this parish 
has participated in common with the district around, is the facili- 
ty of communication with all parts of the country. , Roads of the 
very best description intersect it in all directions, along which 
coaches and carriers are continually passing, affording means of 
conveyance to the places around. A constant communication has 
been opened by steam both with Edinburgh and London ; that 
with the latter place has only been recently established, but has 
already exerted a marked influence on the arrangements of the 



CONTIN. 



235 



farmer, as rendering the feeding of stock, for which this has open- 
ed up the market, to which little attention has been hitherto paid 
here, an object of the first importance. 

With all these changes, the condition of the people has been 
improving. Habits of cleanliness and comfort now more generally 
prevail, and the bulk of the people have been advancing in intelli- 
gence and information ; towards which the facilities of education, 
especially the institution of the Sabbath and Infant Schools, have 
contributed ; and which the establishment of libraries accessible 
to the lower classes would still further promote. A savings bank 
is also very desirable for the encouragement of right management 
and economy. But many of the people are extremely poor, and 
in want of regular employment, — a want which can only be sup- 
plied by the introduction of manufactures, for which the place is 
well situated. There is abundance of people who would be, glad 
of employment. Living is comparatively moderate. The home 
market for several kinds of manufactures would be considerable, 
and conveyance to the foreign markets would always be easy and 
open.

PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOB OF ROSS. 

THE REV. CHARLES DOWNIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parish of Contin is situate in the centre of the 
county of Ross. Its etymology is not easily determined, and there 
are various opinions concerning it. In the former Statistical Ac- 
count, the name is supposed to be derived from the Gaelic words 
Con-tuinn, i. e. the meeting of the waves or waters, with reference 
to the branches of the river Rasay, which form a small island, that 
has been, for time immemorial, the clergyman's possession and 
place of residence. It is also observable that rivers of a consider- 
able size meet at other two points in the parish. This derivation 
is not quite satisfactory ; but we adopt it, in the absence of a 
better. 



236 



llOSS AND CllOMAllTY. 



• Extent — Boundaries. — Contin is 33 miles long, by measure- 
ment of the Parliamentary road that passes through it ; and the 
breadth is believed to be little short of the length. Thus, as re- 
gards extent of surface, it ranks among the largest parishes in Scot- 
land, it is bounded on the west by Gairloch and Lochcarron ; on 
the south by Kilmorack and Urray ; on the east by Urray and 
Fodderty ; and on the north by Lochbroom. The general aspect 
of the parish is mountainous ; and the atmosphere is generally mild 
and dry. 

Hydrogrcqjhy. — The parish is abundantly supplied with peren- 
nial springs of the most wholesome water. On the estate of Hil- 
ton, there are several strongly impregnated with iron. 

Lakes are numerous. Those of sufficient importance to be here 
named, are Loch Chroisg, supposed to be 5 miles long, and 1 
broad ; Loch Fannich, 12 miles in length, and 1 in breadth ; Loch 
Luichart, 6 miles long, and generally half a mile broad ; Loch 
Killin, 2 miles long, and about 1 mile in breadth. In each of 
these, the water is mossy, and of a mild temperature. 

There are likewise the smaller lakes of Achilty and Kinellan, 
which deserve to be noticed separately. The former is about 2 
miles in circumference, and abounds in trout and char. The wa- 
ter is unusually pure,. and very rarely freezes. The scenery all 
around this lake is highly picturesque. It is remarkable that a 
rivulet from an adjoining little lake forms the only visible ingress, 
while there is n6 egress that can be seen, although it is believed 
there is a subterraneous communication from it to the river Rasay, 
which runs within one mile to the north-east. 

Loch Kinellan is also a pleasing object, with its pretty little 
island, for many years a garden ; and the fine arable fields on 
one side contrast strikingly with the wilder scenery on the other. 
There is here a very distinct echo. 

The principal rivers are,— the Connon, which has its origin ui 
Loch Chroisg, in the western extremity of the parish, and is fed 
by tributary streams in its progress to the sea :— Meig, which ori- 
ginates in Glenigag, the most distant point of Contin to the west, 
and receives similar supplies until it joins the Connon at Little 

Scatnell; Rasay, or Black Water, whose source is in Strath- 

Vaich, on the confines of Lochbroom, and which runs parallel to the 
other two, until the three waters unite at Moy, and form one river, 
the Connon, which discharges itself into Cromarty Frith, within ;v 
few miles from the town of Dingwall. 



CONTIN. 



237 



Salmon, pike, and trout are caught in these lakes and rivers. 
Geoloffi/.— The prevailing formation in this parish is gneiss with 
its various subordinate rocks ; the old red sandstone also occurs, 
but only in the lower parts of the parish. 

jYood.— A considerable extent of the lowland district is cover- 
ed with wood, part of which has been planted. At one period, a 
large proportion of the parish must have been wooded ; for many 
roots and trunks of trees are still found imbedded in moss, in si- 
tuations where there is not so much as a shrub now to be seen. 
Even in the recollection of persons still living, there were forests 
of Scots fir, remarkable for the richness and durability of their 
timber. These have been cut down, but there remain some plan- 
tations of larch and fir; and the soil is congenial to oak, ash, elm, 
birch, plane, alder, and beech also. Of the latter, some venerable 
and stately trees at Coul are highly ornamental. 

11. — Civil History. 
Land-oioners. — The number of land-owners is 11, of whom only 
one Sir George Mackenzie resides in the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — With the exception of an old mutilated 
fragment, and one very imperfect register, there is no public re- 
cord of any kind, of a remoter date than 1805. Marriages and 
births were not regularly entered until 1826 ; but since then a re- 
cord of these has been kept in due form. 

Emintnt Men. — Of -iEneas Morison, the last Episcopal minister 
of Contin, many interesting anecdotes are still related, illustrative 
of his wit and benevolence. This excellent man suffered very harsh 
treatment for refusing to conform to presbytery. He was rudely 
ejected from his own church, to which he had fled as a sanctuary ; 
and he closed a long, and honourable, and useful life in great in- 
digence. It may be noticed, also, that Mr Murdo Mackenzie, the 
second Presbyterian minister in the parish, appears to have been a 
man whose, prudence, sagacity, and decision of character fitted him 
.well for the times in which he lived, and the circumstances under 
which he acted. Here, too, the name of the late Rev. Roderick 
Mackenzie, minister of Kilmuir Wester and Suddy, who was for 
sixteen years minister of Contin, is well entitled to a place, for his 
remarkable benevolence of disposition, — his active exertions to pro- 
mote the views of deserving youth, — and the paternal interest he 
ever manifested in all that concerned the welfare of his flock. 

Antiquities. — At the eastern extremity of Loch Achilty, is seen 
one of those circles formed of stone, within which the Druids are 



238 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



supposed to have worshipped. We have heard that an attempt was 
made, some years ago, to ascertain its contents ; but it ended in 
disappointment, as nothing else was found than a few empty earth- 
en jars. 

In Lake Kinellan stands an artificial island, resting upon logs 
of oak, on which the family of Seaforth had at one period an house 
of strength ; and a quarter of a mile eastward, is the place of Blar 
na'n Ceann, or field of heads, — so named, from having been the 
scene of a very sanguinary conflict between the Mackenziesof Sea- 
forth, and Macdonells of Glengarry. The latter, according to 
tradition, came, as was the fashion in those days, to resent an old 
feud by force of arms, but were routed after great slaughter ; and, 
being pursued by the Mackenzies to the confluence of the rivers 
Rasay and Connon at Moy, were there forced into the water, and 
drowned. 

There is still in Loch Achilty a small island, likewise supposed 
to be artificial. It belonged to MacLea Mor, i. e. Great Mac- 
Lea, who possessed, at the same time, a large extent of property 
in the parish ; and who was wont, in seasons of danger, to retire to 
the island as a place of refuge from his enemies. The ruins of the 
buildings which he there occupied may still be traced. A niche 
was long seen in the wall of the church, called Cruist Mhic' a 
Lea, from its having formed part of a vault in which that family 
was buried. 

Modern Buildings. — At Coul, in the eastern part of the parish, 
a new mansion-house was built in 1821, which is handsome and 
commodious. The surrounding grounds have been tastefully laid 
out, and the garden is kept in a superior style. 

Two churches have been, of late years, erected in this parish, 
— one at Keanlochhuchart, in 1825- — and the other in Strathcon- 
non, in 1830, — upon the Government grant for building additional 
places of worship in the Highlands and Islands of Scolland.

The number of males in 1831 was 943, of females 1080. The 
inhabitants, being partial to the place of their nativity, do not re- 
move from it while they can earn a subsistence, until they are swept 
off" to make way for extensive farmers. 

The average of births for the last seven years has been 55 
of marriages, - - -14

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50

Gaelic, being the vernacular tongue, is the language chiefly 
spoken ; but, from the general diffusion of knowledge by means of 
schools, English is acquired by a large portion of the rising gene- 
ration. 

Halits and Character of the People.— Poverty having tended 
greatly to crush the social feelings of the people, they enjoy in a 
very limited degree, the pleasures and advantages of society ; yet 
they are in general not dissatisfied with their condition. The ge- 
neral character of the peasantry merits the most honourable testi- 
mony. It is that of a religious and moral people. Wherever the 
contrary appears, it may be traced to the influence of bad example, 
or to the mismanagement of those into whose hands it has been 
their misfortune to fall. Here, as throughout the Highlands, the 
native inhabitants discover great natural acuteness. Their dispo- 
sition is ingenuous ; and when treated with kindness, they are tract- 
able, and grateful. Sincerity of friendship, ardour of attachment, 
and strict fidelity to those who repose confidence in them, continue 
to characterize them. In their dealings they are just, in their 
callings industrious, in their manners obliging, disinterested in hos- 
pitality, and kind and generous towards their brethren in distress. 
With few exceptions, they are of sober habits, and give regular at- 
tendance upon public worship. 

The Highlanders are grossly calumniated, when represented as 
inactive and indolent. Let the proper encouragement be given to 
them, and it will be found that, however far they may surpass, they 
are certainly not inferior to any of their countrymen, in sagacity, 
abilitv, and inclination to work. It is true that in Contin, as well 
as in various other parishes, the population is seen at present under 
many disadvantages. The few that remain of the old race are 
greatly reduced in circumstances : and those who have known the 
noble-minded people of these districts in better days, — who are 
competent to judge, and who institute a comparison now, will 
readily, yet sorrowfully subscribe to the sentiment of the poet : 

" A bold peasantry, their country's pride, 
vVhen once destroyed can never be supplied. ' 



240 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



To the pleasures of the sportsman, who ranges unmolested over 
moors and mountains, the uihabitants of Contin were long accus- 
tomed, in common with their Highland neighbours. But these 
days are past : and the people are now utter strangers to such 
amusements, for where the game is not let to English sportsmen, 
it is very carefully preserved. Poaching of any kind is therefore 
little practised. Indeed, he who possesses the proper independent 
feeling that animates the breast of a true Highlander, scorns thus 
to take what the lord of the soil denies to him. 

For many years smuggling prevailed to an alarming extent, 
throughout the interior of the parish, and must have been hurtful, 
as it always is, to the morals of the people ; but it has been so com- 
pletely suppressed, that illicit whisky has now become almost as 
rare as foreign spirits. 

In the course of the last three years, there were 4 illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

By last census the number of males employed in agriculture, was 27 1 

in manufactures, 0 
in retail trade or handicraft, 50 

educated men, &amp;c. . 13 

labourers, ... 45 

retired tradesmen not included above, • IG 

female servants, . . 97 

The precise extent of arable and pasture lands it has been im- 
possible to ascertain ; but the want of this information is of less 
consequence, from the greater part of the parish being mountainous, 
and therefore chiefly adapted to pastoral purposes. It may, how- 
ever be remarked, that the arable land in the several valleys is of 
an active and fertile description ; and in the eastern or lowland di- 
vision, there are several farms entirely arable, averaging 140 or 1.50 
acres each, the soil of which is of a superior kind, and farmed after 
the most improved system of modern husbandry. 

Rent of Land— The average rent of arable land per acre is 
L. 1, 10s. ; of grazing an ox or cow, about the same; ofa sheep's 
grass, from Is. 9d., to 2s. per annum. 

• 'Bate of Waffes.—Lahouvers have commonly 1 s. a day in sum- 
mer, and lOd. in winter with victuals, or Is. 6d. and Is. 4d. with- 
out victuals; a fiirm-servant receives from L. 7 to L. 8 of yearly 
wages, besides his victuals. Masons and carpenters earn 2s. 6d. 

and 2s. per day. 

Cattle and Sheep Stock.— Several farms are stocked both with 
Cheviot and black-faced sheep : and those reared on some graz-

ings fetch the highest prices at market. We may particularize 
the farm of Acnashine, belonging to Mr Mackenzie of Kilcoy, 
the stock of which when exhibited at competitions has repeatedly 
obtained premiums ; likewise Leadgowan, the property of Mi" 
Mackenzie of Hilton, and which is also well known as a sheep 
•walk of superior value. 

The few black cattle reared for sale are the remains of the 
old Highland breed, which seems to have degenerated in the same 
ratio in which the circumstances of the people have declined. 

Leases vary in their duration from four to nineteen years ; and 
it naturally follows that the tenants who receive the longest leases 
improve their farms most. All the arable farms are furnished with 
suitable houses and inclosures. 

Recent Improvements. — The principal recent improvement in 
this parish is at Craigdarroch, where Captain James Murray of 
the Royal Navy has erected a beautiful residence within a short walk 
of Loch Achilty. The house is a substantial and comfortable 
building, and stands in a romantic situation, commanding a view 
of the lake and surrounding scenery. The garden and grounds 
have been laid out with great taste; and a track of barren moor 
has been, by persevering industry and judicious outlay, converted 
into productive soil. 

Fishing. — The salmon-fishings of Connon and Rasay are the 
only two in the parish. The quality of the fish caught in each is 
superior ; and both may be worth about L. 40 a-year. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Toion. — Dingwall, which is distant seven miles, is the 
nearest market-town, — none of the villages in the parish being of 
sufficient size to support a market. The Parliamentary road to 
Lochcarron passes through the parish from east to west. There 
are likewise district roads. The post-town is Dingwall. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Contin has always stood 
where it is now, on the minister's glebe, within two miles of the 
eastern extremity of the parish. It would seem to have been ori - 
ginally placed there, from the vicinity being better suited than any 

 Having mentioned tlie honoured name of Alexander Mackenzie, Esq. of Hilton, 
we do no more than discharge a debt to justice, in paying a short but sincere tribute 
to his genuine worth and to his unequalled character as a proprietor. It has been 
uniformly his desire, that his tenants should enjoy comfort and happiness ; and under 
his fostering care they fiiiled not to pros|er. In him too tlie virtuous poor and friend- 
less ever found a benefactor. All who occupied his soil regarded him as a father and 
a friend.

other part to a permanent population ; and for the same reason, we 
may suppose it to have been continued in use during the time of 
Episcopacy. 

Its local situation could never have been convenient to a great 
part of the population ; but the inconvenience arising therefrom 
was remedied latterly by the labours of a missionary minister, who» 
itinerated among the people in the remoter parts, and the people 
have now the benefit of two Parliamentary ministers stationed 
among them. 

At what period the church was erected is not known ; but the 
ancient appearance of the fabric, — several niches in the wall, — and 
the immense number of human bones found strewed within, prior 
to the late repairs, afford a strong presumption that it was built in 
Popish times. There cannot be a doubt that it was used for di- 
vine service while Episcopacy flourished in Scotland. About sixty 
years ago, it was newly roofed and slated : but not having been fi- 
nished within, it was long the most miserable place of worship in 
the shape of a parish church in the kingdom ; nor can much be 
said infavour of it still. A repair was executed upon it last season, 
but of such a nature that it continues confined and comfortless. 

The manse was built in the year 179 ', but was very imperfect- 
ly finished ; and having been found inadequate to the incumbent's 
comfortable accommodation, the Court of Session, with its wonted 
enlightened and impartial liberality, decerned for a repair and im- 
provement of it and of the offices in 1829. 

Twenty-six Scots acres, arable and pasture, constitute the glebe. 
Being encompassed by water, and very flat, it is subject to inundation, 
which greatly deteriorates its value. In 1823, all the heritors 
surrendered their teinds ; the stipend is consequently payable in 
money, and averages the value of 1 6 chalders. For nearly thirty 
years, there has been an itinerating catechist on the establish- 
ment of the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. The 
people being warmly attached to the Established Church, there 
is no chapel or Dissenting meeting-house of any kind in the parish; 
and we are happily free from Papists, voluntaries, and Seceders. 

Divine service is performed every Lord's day both in English 
and Gaelic, and is well attended in each language. The average 
number of communicants is about 100. 

Education. — Besides the parish school, there are other three 
supported by societies, and one by the inhabitants. English, 
Gaelic, writing, book-keeping, and arithmetic are the branches 



CONTIN. 



243 



generally taught in each of the schools ; and in the parish school, 
if desired, instruction may be also had in geography, Latin, Greek, 
and mathematics. 

The parochial schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, and the amount 
of fees vai'ies from L. 8 to L. 10. Probably the other teachers re- 
ceive from L. 15 to L. 20 each, including salary and fees. 

Generally speaking, the people are sensible of the value of edu- 
cation. 

Poor. — The poor are maintained entirely by church collections, 
and the interest of a small fund, amounting to L. 71, 3s. 8d. which 
has been made up out of the remains of an old legacy bequeathed 
to them, and savings added occasionally thereto by the kirk-ses- 
sion. Of persons who receive parochial aid the ordinary number 
is 43, and the average sum allowed to each i-s 8s. Church col- 
lections average L. 7, 9s. a-year. 

The poor in this parish do not apply for relief, until compel- 
led by necessity, — in any other case they regard it as a degradation. 

Markets. — A market, established time out of mind, still conti- 
nues to be held at Contin Inn, twice every year. At one period, 
the site being favourable, the business transacted was considerable. 

Inm. — There are three inns along the line of the Parliament- 
ary road, besides two or three dram-shops, which last are to be 
deprecated for their immoral influence. 

Fuel. — Such as can afford the expense of coals, burn them; but 
the ordinary fuel is peat. 

It does not appear necessary to add any thing further on the 
statistics of the parish ; and the writer regrets that the foregoing 
account contains so little which he can hope to have any interest 
for the general reader. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The increased value of land in the parish is worthy of remark. 

In 1792, the rental amounted at the utmost to L. 1400 only; 
now, after a lapse of forty-two years, it approaches to nearly L. 6000. 
As regards the arable land, the value has arisen from the addi- 
tions made to it, as well as from the improved system of husband- 
ry which has been adopted. The facility of access to market has 
also had an effect : and the high prices of sheep and wool for 
many years sufficiently account for the extraordinary increase in 
the rents of pasture farms. As an instance of the latter, the grazing 
of Fannich, which let fifty years ago at L. 12, brings the present 
proprietor a yearly tent of L. 200. The value of game is no less 



244 



ttOSS AND CROMARTY. 



Striking. In some cases, a larger rent is now paid for the privi- 
lege of shooting alone than was paid forty-five years ago for the 
right of pasturing. 

It is gratifying to observe, that the march of intellect has 
dispelled many of those superstitions that were formerly so com- 
mon in the Highlands ; and there is reason to believe, that, in a 
few years, such as remain shall disappear.

PRESBYTERY OF BINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. JOHN NOBLE, MINISTER. 



L_ Topography and Natural History. 

iVame.— The name of this parish is supposed to be derived from 
two Gaelic words, Foigli and Bitaobh, which signify " a meadow 
along the side of a hill." These terms are descriptive of the val- 
ley of Strathpeflfer, which forms the principal part of the parish, 
and stretches westward from Dingwall to the distance of four miles. 

Extent, 4 c.— The parish has been greatly diminished in extent, 
quoad sacra, since the localities attached to the Parliamentary 
churches were disjoined from it. It measures, at present, from 
east to west 9 miles, and from north to south 11 miles; and is 
bounded by Dingwall on the east; Urray on the south ; Contm 
and Kinlochluichart on the west ; and Kincardine and Kdtearn 
on the north. 

Topographical Appearances, 8fc.—The parish is one of the most 
hilly and mountainous in Scotland. This is its general character, 
with the exception of the valley of Strathpeffer. 

Ben-Wyves or Ben-Uaish rises to the height of 3426 feet, and 
in respect of lateral bulk is the principal hill in the north. It was 
never known to be so free of snow as in the singularly hot summer 
of 1826. Its top is covered with a green soft sward, and when the 
sky is cloudless the extent and grandeur of the view from it amply 
compensate for the labour and fatigue of climbing. The principal 
proprietor, it is said, holds his right of possession from his Majesty, 
op condition of presenting a snow-ball at the court of St James , on 



FODDEUTY. 



245 



any day of the year on which it may be required. At the base, 
there is an extensive peat-moss, part of which is very spongy and 
easily consumed, and a part hard and black ; than which, there is 
scarcely any fuel better fitted for keeping up a mild and gentle 
heat. 

Knock- Farril, situated on the opposite or south side of the val- 
ley, is crowned with one of those vitrified forts which so puzzle and 
interest the antiquary. It is one of the most beautiful and strik- 
ingly marked in the country. Its form is conical, and the ascent 
on the side fronting the valley almost perpendicular. The ruins 
on the top surround a plain of nearly an acre in extent, from which 
Craig-Phadric, near Inverness, and Dun-Skaith, on the northern 
Sutor of Cromarty, are distinctly seen. Most of these hill-forts 
seem, in the first instance, to have been constructed by the ab- 
original inhabitants, for the purpose of defending themselves 
from their enemies. The vitrified appearance which some of 
them present, it is well known, has been the source of much 
controversy. Mr Williams and Dr Anderson supposed that fire 
had been used for cementing the walls, by fusing the materials 
of which they were composed. Mr Tytler the late Lord 
Woodhouselee was of opinion, that the vitrification resulted from 
the destruction of the buildings, of which we now see only the 
ruins. There is a third view, which has been ably advocated by 
Sir George Stewart Mackenzie of Coul, Baronet, viz. that the vi- 
trified appearance was caused by beacon-fires. " The following 
considerations," says he, " seem to support the idea of such high 
situations being chosen exclusively for signal stations. Such hills 
only as command an extensive view of the sea or adjacent country 
have been selected. There is a regular chain from Knock- Farril 
and Craig-Phadfic along the great valley of Lochness to the west 
coast, and others are in sight towards the east, so that on the ap- 
pearance of an enemy on either side of the island, the whole coun- 
try from coast to coast could be informed, perhaps within the short 
space of an hour. And such is the situation of vitrified forts ex- 
clusively ; for they are not seen in any but commanding situations, 
while many spots, more convenient and better adapted in every re- 
spect for defence, are often to be found in their vicinity, or at no 
great distance." 

The origin of beacons is of the highest antiquity. They were 
used among the Jews and Greeks. The Romans, too, were wont 
to light up nocturnal signal fires; and latterly the g-ncient heal 



246 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



fires of Ireland have, in times of excitement, been revived, for a 
similar purpose in that country. 

" To be satisfied," says Sir George, " of the reason why the 
signal fires should be kindled on or beside a heap of stones, we 
have only to imagine a gale of wind to have arisen when a fire was 
kindled on the bare ground. The fuel would be blown about and 
dispersed to the great annoyance of those who attended. The 
plan for obviating the inconvenience thus occasioned, which would 
occur most naturally and readily, would be to raise a heap of stones 
on either side of which the fire might be placed to windward; — and 
to account for the vitrification appearing all round the area, it is 
only necessary to allow the inhabitants of the country to have had 
a system of signals. A fire at one end might denote something 
different from a fire at the other, or in some intermediate part. 
On some occasions, two or more fires might be necessary, and 
sometimes a fire along the whole line. It cannot be doubted," he 
adds, " that the rampart was originally formed with as much re- 
gularity as the nature of the materials would allow, both in order 
to render it more durable, and to make it serve the purposes of 
defence." After combating the other opinions upon the subject, 
he concludes, that these structures may have served as beacons to 
castles in their vicinity, the remains of which are almost in every 
instance to be found, e. g. that Knock-Farril may have been the 
signal-post of the Castle of Dingwall, which formed the principal 
residence of the ancient Earls of Ross. 

Craig-aurFhiach, or Raven's Rock, lies to the westward, and pre- 
sents a bold perpendicular front, from which a loud and distinct 
echo is heard. Near to it, is a very strong chalybeate called Saint's 
Well. Another spring, on the north-east side of Knock-Farril, 
bears the name of John the Baptist's, — the water of which is of 
the purest kind, and till within the last fifty years was supposed to 
possess a miraculous virtue. It used to be resorted to by sick peo- 
ple and maniacs, who always left on a neighbouring bush or tree a 
bit of coloured cloth or thread as a relic 

Loch-Ussie lies to the south of Knock-Farril. It contains se- 
veral small islands, and is surrounded with a young thriving 
plantation. Kenneth Oure, whose sayings are still held in 
great repute by the common people, resided in its neighbourhood. 
He attributed his power of foretelling future events to the posses-

sion of a beautiful white stone resembling a pearl, but much larg- 
er. It is said that, shortly before his death, he threw it into Loch- 
Ussie, predicting that it would be found many years afterwards in 
the stomach of a pike, by one who, in consequence, should be also 
endowed with the gift of prophecy. Above Dunglass, is a low 
mound covered with green sward, and surrounded by a well defin- 
ed circle of forty feet diameter. It seems to be a fairy ring. The 
grass of the circle is greener and fresher than that in the middle, 
— a phenomenon which is supposed to be occasioned either by 
lightning, or by a kind of fungus, which breaks and pulverizes the 
soil. 

The views from all the eminences in the parish are extensive 
and striking, but especially from those to the north. Behind, rises 
the stupendous Ben-Wyves, its top often covered with clouds and 
storm; in front, is Knock-Farril ; and beneath, lies the beautiful 
vale of Strathpeffer, with its gently winding road, its well-cultivated 
fields, its tall ancestral trees, its venerable-looking castle, and its 
neat dwelling-houses. Stretching the eye to the westward, there 
appears nothing but one vast assemblage of conical topped hills of 
the wildest and most rugged description ; while on the east, are to 
be seen the town of Dingwall, part of the Frith of Cromarty, and 
the rich landscape which surrounds the Castle of TuUoch. The 
view, as a whole, is one of the most varied and magnificent, and 
includes the heights of Inverness-shire rising successively one above 
another, until they are lost from sight in the far-distant clouds. 

Meteorology . — Climate, according to Dr Ure, is the prevailing 
constitution of the atmosphere relative to heat, wind, and moisture. 
There is considerable humidity in the high grounds of this parish, 
and the cold at times is very intense. In the lower parts, however, 
the air is mild and genial. Even in winter, this is not unfrequently 
the case in the vicinity of the spa. Hills surround it in all direc- 
tions, the sinuosity of the valley breaks the force of the cold east- 
erly winds,— while those from the west are deprived of much of their 
moisture by the heath-clad hills over which they pass ; and besides, 
the gradual rising slope of this district elevates it into a kind of 
mid-air, which is always pure and invigorating. During the greater 
part of the year, the wind blows from between south-west and 
north-west, and at the time of the equinoxes is generally accom- 
panied with rain. There are occasionally strong gales from the 
east and north-east, but the most violent proceed from the former 
points. Thunder is seldom heard. The temperature in summer 



2\S ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

is often equal to, and at times greater than, that cx|.'rienced in 
England; but in spring and autumn, it is subject to sudden changes, 
which are severely felt. The climate, as a whole, however, is one 
of the purest and most salubrious in great Britain, which accounts 
for the longevity of the people, and the fewness of the diseases 
which prevail among them. The healthiness of the parish has 
been much increased by the general system of drainage begun by 
Major M'Kenzie, Fodderty, in 1811, in consequence of which, 
what was formerly in a state of marsh and meadow now yield lux- 
uriant crops of grain, and the grounds which used often to be cover- 
ed with mildew have been almost, if not entirely, freed from it. 

Hydrography. — The parish is well supplied with water. Besides 
numerous springs which are chiefly perennial, there are also many 
mineral springs — some pure chalybeate, and others strongly impreg- 
nated with hydrogen gas. Of the latter kind, two at the west end of 
the strath have been long known for their medicinal qualities, which 
they seem to derive from the bituminous rocks, mixed with beds 
of shale abounding with pyrites or sidphuret of iron, through which 
the water flows. An imperfect analysis of these springs was given 
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1772. That by Dr Thom- 
son of Glasgow in 1 824 is as follows : 

" There are two wells," says he, " at a httle distance from each 
other. The temperature of the lower well, on the 24th June, was 
39°, and that of the upper 39|°. The day was rainy, and the tem- 
perature of the air rather under 60°. Both had the smelHof sul- 
phuretted hydrogen gas. But the upper spring was obviously 
stronger than the lower. The specific gravity of these wells was as 
follows : 

Upper well, 1.00193 
Lower well, 1.00091 

" An imperial gallon of the upper spring was found to contain 

Sulphuretted hydrogen gas, - - 26.167 cubic inches. 

Sulphate of soda, - - - 67.770 grams. 

Sulphate of lime, . - - - 39.454 do, 

ComiTion salt, - - - 24.728 do. 

Sulphate of magnesia, - - - 6.242 do. 

" An imperial gallon of the water attached to the pump -room 
yielded 

Sulphuretted hydrogen gas, - 13.659 cubic inches. 

" The saline contents were similar to those of the upper spring, 
but in the proportion to them of 7 to 9, 

Sulphate of soda, - - - 52.710 grains. 

Sulphate of lime, . - - - 30.686 do.

J 



FODDERTY. 



249 



" The upper spring is more strongly impregnated with sulphu- 
retted hydrogen gas than Moffat wells ; but the lower spring is 
a good deal weaker." 

Stratlipeffer Spa was brought into great celebrity by Dr Tho- 
mas Morrison of Elsick and Disblair, in Aberdeenshire ; a gentle- 
man who had previously tried almost every other spa in the king- 
dom. He gave it as his opinion, that this was the most valuable 
of the whole, and, in describing the climate, his usual expression 
was, " the balsamic air of Strathpeffer." At his suggestion, the 
proprietor built, in 1819, a handsome pump-room over the lovier 
w ell, 40 feet long by 20 feet broad, in which there is an excellent 
full drawn likeness of Dr Morrison, done by George Watson, 
Edinburgh. It cost L. 125 Sterling, and was paid for in subscrip- 
tions of from one to ten guineas by the visitors, out of grateful re- 
spect to Dr Morrison for his able and gratuitous services. 

The season for drinking the water extends from the beginning 
of May to the middle or end of October. It is found to be high- 
ly beneficial in all cases of ill health which result from a relaxed 
state of the system, especially in the great variety of disorders oc- 
casioned by nervous debility ; in gouty, rheumatic, scrofulous, and 
cutaneous complaints ; in affections of the kidneys and bladder, the 
water being highly diuretic ; in cases of dyspepsia, and for consti- 
tutions which have suffered by long residence in tropical climates. 
It is prejudicial, however, to those whose ailments are attended 
with any degree of inflammation or fever. Its specific gravity ap- 
proximates to that of the mineral waters on the banks of the 
Rhine ; from which circumstance, large quantities of it can be taken 
without oppressing the stomach, or irritating the system. It is 
quickly digested, and works its way gradually yet thoroughly into 
the constitution, on which it acts as a mild alterative. After tak- 
ing a course of the sulphureous water, it is generally of advantage 
to follow it up with a course of chalybeate, of which there is a 
spring close to the pump-room, and many others in the neighbour- 
hood. There is no doubt but the pure dry bracing air which cir- 
culates around this district, and the beauty of the scenery, by 
tempting invalids to walk abroad, contribute in a great measure to 
their restoration to health. 

The regulations are, that all ladies and gentlemen put down 
their name upon arrival, and pay 2s. each week during their at- 
tendance ; that those drinking the water at the upper or lower 
well, but not attending the pump-room, pay Is. as above ; and that 



250 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



all strangers taking only one glass in the pump-room, pay 6d. The 
allowance to the well-keeper is voluntary. On week-days the 
pump-room is open from 6 to 9 a. m., 12 to 2 p. m. and 5 to 7 
in the evening. It is shut on Sabbath days from 9 a. m. to 5 p. 
M. The poor have the water gratis, and are uccommodated with 
a comfortable room attached to the upper well. They receive un- 
remitted and disinterested attention from John M'Kenzie, Esq. 
M. D., Kinellan, who acts in this quarter in his professional capa- 
city of consulting physician. 

The public prints are regularly supplied by the proprietor. 
Within the last four years a penny-post has been established. 
Bread, meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables and fruit are to be got in 
the neighbourhood. During the drinking season, a coach runs twice 
a day to Dingwall, which is connected with another that goes to 
Inverness in the morning and returns in the evening. 

Since the spa has come so much into repute, a number of re- 
spectable-looking buildings have been erected for the accommoda- 
tion of visitors. Through the benevolent exertions of J. E. Gor- 
don, Esq. late Member for Dundalk, an institution has also been 
established for the benefit of the poor who resort thither from a 
distance. It is capable of accommodating fifty at one time, and is 
to be opened in the course of next year. The hotel at Blar-na- 
ceaun, which has been recently built, within half a mile of the pump- 
room, is not surpassed by any in the country ; and there is also a 
comfortable inn on the east side, where strangers receive every 
convenience and attention. 

Geology.— is usually the case, in the high grounds of the pa- 
rish, which present a bold front and outline, only the primary rocks 
are to be met with, and of these the most frequent is gneiss. The 
south side of the valley abounds in red sandstone and conglomerate, 
while on the north, the rock is bluish and slaty, exhibiting in many 
places swinestone of a blackish brown colour, which on being 
rubbed gives out a fetid urinous odour. In the direction of the 
spa, the rock begins to assume the appearance of a dark calcareo- 
bituminous schist, soft and foliated, and mixed with beds of 
shale abounding with pyrites. On the north-west and north, are 
several appearances of coal. Some extracted about seventy years 
ao-o was found to be of a clear black colour, and remarkably in- 
flammable. Neither of these places, the one lying in the vicinity 
of Castle-Leod, and the other near the river Sgiah, at the foot of 
Wyves, have been considered worthy of being worked, as the coal

found in them does not seem to belong to the true coal forma- 
tion.  

The land towards Dingwall is heavy, approaching to clay. To 
the westward, it presents in many places a fine free loam or mould, 
partly black and partly brown, having a swinestone or gravelly 
subsoil. And on the south side of the parish, it is generally black 
with a very retentive bottom, which renders it extremely wet in 
winter. 

Botany. — The less ordinary botanical specimens which have 
been noticed are, the Pinguicula lusitanica and Melampyrum syl- 
vaticum, near Castle Leod, the Linncea borealis, in the woody 
part of the district of Brahan, and the Arbutus alpina, Saxifraga 
oppositifolia, Betula nana, Azalea procumbens, Alopecurus alpi~ 
nus, &amp;c. around Wyves. Both here and along the glens to the 
west of Castle-Leod, mosses, of every shade and colour, and of 
the softest texture, are to be met with in abundance, f 

Zooloyy. — The rarer kind of animals which occur are the deer 
and roe-deer, also the fallow-deer from the policy of Brahan, 
the fox, martin, wild and polecat, stoat or ermine, and weasel. 

The ornithology includes the ordinary sorts of game, together

Black trout, some of which are of considerable size, are often

the strath, and gives to it its distinctive name. And the river Co- 
non, part of which belongs to the Honourable Mrs Hay M'Kenzie, 
and is connected with this parish, abounds in salmon. The quan- 
tity taken, however, has of late years diminished. This was sup- 
posed to be owing to the stake-nets in the Frith, which have been 
recently abolished. But these, if confined within low water mark, 
could rarely intercept either the kelts or fry, as the former, from 
their exhausted state, and the latter from their weakness, suffer

t The Rev. D M'Kenzie, one of the former incumbents of the parish, surrounded 
the lawn in front of the manse with a hedge of the barberry. However desirable 
as a fence, both from its beautiful appearance and its thorny branches this shrub may 
be, it was found necessary to cut it down, as the corn sown near it on the glebe, and 
also to a considerable distance in the adjoining fields, usually proved abortive— the 
ears being in general destitute of grain.

II.CiviL History. 

The ancient history of this parish is involved in much obscurity. 
Though locally situated in the county of Ross, it has belonged to 
that] of Cromarty, since the time of George Viscount of Tarbat. 
The founder of his family was Roderick M'Kenzie, second son to 
Colin of Kintail. Roderick was knighted by James VL, and 
left two sons, John and Kenneth, the former of whom was creat- 
ed a baronet in the following reign, and at his death bequeathed 
his lands to his son George. He was the original purchaser of 
the lands of Cromarty, and in the reign of Queen Anne was made 
Secretary of State and Earl of Cromarty. An act was procured 
by him, in 1698, which annexed the barony of Tarbat and his 
other lands in Ross-shire to the shire of Cromarty " in all time 
coming, and to all effects;" — among these, was a large proportion of 
the parish of Fodderty, whence its anomalous connexion with the 
neighbouring county. 

The parish was formerly divided into three, viz. Foddertj', 
Kinnettas, and Tollie, in Brahan. In the first two, there are bury- 
ing grounds still in use, and in which the older inhabitants re- 
member to have seen the remains of chapels. Traces of a bury- 
ino- o-round are also to be met with on a small island below the 
Castle of Brahan ; to the place of worship in which the Tollie 
district would seem to have been formerly attached. 

Antiquities. — North of the burying-ground at Fodderty, lies 
Croicht-an-Team puil or Temple- croft, in which several stone- 
coffins have been found. One, containing two skeletons, was dug 
up within the last four years. Coffins of the same kind have been 
met with near Keppoch Lodge, and in the heights of the pro- 
perty of Hilton. The name usually given to them is Kistvaen, 
from cist, a chest, and maen changed to vaen, a stone. Sometimes 
an urn has been found in them ; but those discovered in this parish 
contained only bones and ashes. 

Of those sepulchral remains called cairns, there is an excel- 
lent specimen oii the heights of the property of Hilton, which 
measures 260 feet by 20 feet. It is situated on a little rising 
ground, having at the east end a standing-stone. Its height has, 
of late years, been much diminished by the removal of the stones 



FODDERTY.

for the building of enclosures or fences. A number of bones have 
been discovered in it. 

In the same neighbourhood are the remains of two Druidical 
circles. Of the one, which lies due north of the cairn, there are 
only three stones remaining, the rest having been blasted and used 
in building. The other, which is situated in the march line be- 
tween the properties of Cromartie and Hilton, presents a singular 
and interesting appearance. In the centre, the stones are from five 
feet to six feet above ground, one foot apart from each other, and 
inclose a space of nine feet diameter. On each side, are the ap- 
pearances of two spaces of smaller dimensions, one having only 
two stones placed at right angles, and the other only one, which 
measures seven and a-half feet by four and a-half feet, and at the 
height of two-thirds has an indentation slightly angular in the 
centre, and cut more deep towards the edges. Surrounding the 
whole are the appearances of several concentric circles of consi- 
derable dimensions, but most of the stones have been carried away. 
It is proper to notice, that, while the proprietor resided in the 
vicinity, the people were prevented from interfering with these in- 
teresting remains of the religion of our Celtic ancestors, who held 
it as a principle, that no temple or covered building should be 
erected for public worship, but that their devotions should be per- 
formed under the open canopy of Heaven. The object of the 
smaller spaces observed in one of the remains can only be mat- 
ter of conjecture. It is not unlikely that they were a kind of 
Holy of Holies in which the Druids met, apart from the vulgar, 
to perform their more sacred rites, or to sit in Council for the 
purpose of determining controversies. Some assign a Scandina- 
vian origin to these remains, believing that the Druids never vi- 
sited Scotland. However this may have been, previous to the in- 
vasion, it is by no means improbable that after it they were induced 
to flee thither by the system of extermination exercised towards 
them by the Romans. Of their religion, little is known, and their 
circles have long since become a mere theme for the antiquary. 

On each side of the church, are two standing-stones. The vul- 
gar tradition respecting them, is, that Knock- Farril, which lies 
directly opposite, was often resorted to by Fin Mac Coul, the 
Fingal of Ossian ; whence, by his immense strength, he threw them 
down upon his enemies. In confirmation of this, the marks of a 
gigantic finger and thumb are still pointed out on one of them. 
Some are of opinion that they were used for oflering up sacrifices 



254 



ROSS AND CUOMARTY. 



in the time of the Druids, as the larger of the two has the appear- 
ance of beinof burnt from top to bottom ; but others, that they 
were erected as memorials to perpetuate some events which, as the 
stones are in their natural "shape, and without inscription, have not 
been transmitted to posterity ; and a third party, that they were 
intended to mark the neutral ground between the Mackenzies of 
Seaforth, and the Mackenzies of Dochmaluack. 

There is another stone halfway between Castle-Leod and the 
Spa with an eagle cut upon it, and called in Gaelic Clach-an- 
tiom-pan. It stands close to the old line of road, and is supposed 
to mark the place where a number of the Munroes fell in an af- 
fray with the Mackenzies of Seaforth. The tradition is as fol- 
lows : The Lady of Seaforth dwelt at that time in a wicker or 
wattled-house at Kinellan. A party of the Munroes came upon 
her by surprise, and carried off the Lady, house, and all that it 
contained. They were overtaken near Castle-Leod, defeated with 
great slaughter, and the Lady of Seaforth rescued. Clach-an 
tiompan was set up by the Munroes over the remains of their fel- 
low clansmen. Kenneth Oure is said to have prophesied that 
in course of time ships should be seen moored to this stone. 

On the north-west side of Knock-farril is a circular enclosure 
or ring, formed of small stones, having the earth somewhat scoop- 
ed out in the interior. There is a similar one near the march 
line between the properties of Cromartie and Hilton, and within 
sight of the former. They are not unlike the pond-barrows of 
Wales, and are supposed to have been used either for the perfor- 
mance of religious rites around them, or for games and combats 
■which took place within them. The common people call them 
fairy-folds. 

On a small eminence at the west end of Park is a number of 
standing stones, placed in a circular form, and enclosing a space 
of about 15 feet in diameter, from which two rows run eastward, and 
make a rectangle of 9 feet by 6 feet. They are supposed to com- 
memorate a bloody battle which took place towards the end of the 
fifteenth century, between the M'Kenzies and the M'Donalds, 
headed by Gillespie, cousin of the Lord of the Isles. The chief of 
the M'Kenzieshad married a sister of the latter ; but for some slight 
reason repudiated her, and is said to have sent her back, by way 
of insult, with a man and horse, each blind of an eye, as she her- 
self had a similar defect. Some time thereafter, a predecessor of 
the Laird of Brodie happened to be on a visit at Kinellan, and on 

4 



FODDERTY, 



255 



departing received from M'Kenzie a present of several heads of 
cattle. As he and his followers were driving these across the low 
grounds to the west of Druim-chatt, they observed the M'Donalds 
approaching to avenge the insult which had been offered to the 
sister of their lord, and immediately returned to assist the M'Kenzies. 
The remains of the Brodies who fell on the occasion are said to have 
been buried under these stones. Tradition attributes the victory 
which the M'Kenzies gained chiefly to the aid which they received 
from a little man with a red night-cap, who appeared suddenly among 
them. Having knocked down one of the M'Donalds, he sat upon 
the lifeless body, and, when asked the reason, replied, " I have kil- 
led only one man, as I am to get the reward only of one man." 
He was told to kill another, and he would receive double — he did 
so, and sat on him likewise. The chief of the M'Kenzies on learn- 
ing the circumstance came hastily to him, and said, " Na cunnte 
ruim 's cha chunnte mi ruit," meaning. Don't reckon with me, and 
I'll not stint thee — whereupon the little man arose, and with every 
blow knocked down a M'Donald, always saying, " 'O nach cunn- 
tair ruim cha chunnte mi ruit." He helped the M'Kenzies to 
gain a decisive battle, and then disappeared into Loch Kinellan. 
Gillespie lost his head on the occasion, which is said to have roll- 
ed down into a well, where it was afterwards found. This conflict 
is commonly called the battle of Blar-na-pairc, from the district of 
this parish in which it was chiefly fought. The beheading of Gil- 
lespie and many of his followers renders it not improbable that it 
■was the same with that of Blar-na-ceaun, or the battle of the heads. 

Castle-Leod, said to have been built by Sir Roderick M'Kenzie, 
tutor of Kintail, and which was one of the principal seats of the 
ancient Earls of Cromarty, is situated on the west side of Strath- 
peffer, near the base of a beautifully rounded topped hill. It is five 
stories in height, exclusive of the attics. Around the eaves are 
three bartizans, one on the south or front, measuring 42 feet by 
3 feet, and the others on the east and west sides, 18 feet by 3 
feet each. There are four turrets, and numerous loopholes which 
rise from the lowest to six different heights. Over the principal 
entry are two stones -having the arms beautifully cut on them in 
high relief; and above two of the windows to the north, are on one, 
R. M. K. 3. Agus. ; and on the other, M. M. C. 1616. The 
walls in many parts of the building are from seven to eight feet 
thick, and the dining-room or hall, which is of considerable 
height, and measures 32 feet by 21 feet, exclusive of the recesses,

has a fire-place in it upwards of 10 feet long by 5 feet high, with 
stone seats at each end. Below is a cell, which was formerly used 
as a prison, with a strongly chained oaken door. The castle is 
built of red sandstone, and presents a remarkable and truly baro- 
nial appearance. It is surrounded with large parks and tall ances- 
tral trees, among which are the oak, ash, sycamore or plane-tree, 
elm, hme, arbor vitse, laburnum, and chestnut. One of the last 
kind is a splendid tree, measuring in circumference at the ground, 
24 feet, and breast high, 18 feet. Its branches spread to the ex- 
tent of about 90 feet in diameter. 

The land-oioners, none of whom are resident in the parish, are, 
in the order of their valuation, John Hay M'Kenzie, Esq. of Cro- 
martie; James Alexander Stewart M'Kenzie, Esq. of Seaforth, M. 
P. ; Alexander M'Kenzie, Esq. of Hilton; Duncan Davidson, Esq. 
of Tulloch ; The Proprietor of Strathconon ; Sir George Stewart 
Mackenzie of Coul, Bart. ; and Sir Colin M'Kenzie of Kilcoy, 
Bart. 

III. — Population. 

The population of this parish in 1735 was 1483 

1794 1730 
1831 2232 

The last census and those taken formerly included the inhabi- 
tants of the districts which are now connected, quoad sacra, with 
the parishes of Carnoch and Kinlochluichart. Exclusive of these, 
the population at present is upwards of 2300. The increase has 
been, in a great measure, occasioned by the villages of Maryburgh 
and Keithtown, which are of recent formation, and by the heights 
being resorted to from remote districts lately converted into pas- 
turage. 

The number of families in the parish is 492. 

The number below 13 years of age who can read or are learning to read, 

216 males, 162 females. 
The number below 13 years of age who can write or are learning to write, 

74 males, 31 females. 
The number above 13 years of age who cannot read either Gaelic or 

English, 538, 

Illegitimate births in the course of the last three years, 6. 

The greatest part of the parish is occupied by large farmers, who 
have introduced all the modern improvements in agriculture. The 
rest of the people consist of small tenants, crofters, a few mecha- 
nics, and the extremely poor. All belong to the Established 
Church, and seem to be cordially attached to it. The Gaelic is 
crenerally spoken, and is still by far the most prevalent language.

The morals of tlie people have, in several respects, undergone 
improvement. In former times, cases of theft, especially, were by 
no means uncommon. 

Many superstitious notions still prevail among the common peo- 
ple. They are firm believers in dreams and warnings — the taisg 
or 107'aith — and also in a kind of fairies or cursed spirits who resid- 
ed in a small knoll directly opposite Knock- Farril ; by whom chil- 
dren were often stolen or changed, before they were christened. 
Here, the old inhabitants say that, even in their day, unearthly mu- 
sic has been heard and unearthly lights seen ; but that the cursed 
spirits have been, long since, laid under a restraint which prevents 
them from making their appearance, or doing mischief as for- 
merly. There is a small spring which rises in a circular hol- 
low in a solid rock on the west side of Rhoagie, called Tobar-na- 
domhnuich, the water of which is believed to possess the virtue of 
indicating whether a sick person shall survive or not. It is taken 
from the spring before sunrise, and after the patient has been 
bathed or immersed in it, if the water appears of a pure colour, it 
foretells his recovery ; but, if of a brown mossy colour, that he will 
die. About six years ago, a mother brought her sickly child a 
distance of thirty miles, to this spring. On approaching it, she was 
startled by the appearance of an animal with glaring eye-balls 
leaping into it. The poor mother considered this as a fatal omen. 
Her affection for her child, however, overcame her fear. She dis- 
lodged the animal and bathed the child, after which it slept more 
soundly than it had ever done before. This seemed at first to 
confirm the sanitory virtue of the water, but the child has since 
died. Within the same period, two friends of a parishioner whose 
life was despaired of, went to consult the spring in his behalf, and 
to fetch some of the water. On placing the pitcher in it, the water 
assumed a circular motion from south to west. They returned with 
joy, and informed the patient, that there was no cause to fear, as the 
motion of the water, being from south to west, was a sure indica- 
tion that he should recover,_whereas, if it had been from north to

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of the parish was built in 1807, 
and is situated within a mile of the pump-room. It was originally in- 
tended to accommodate 400, but the heritors voluntarily agreed to 
enlarge it to the extent of about 200 additional sittings. This was 
done at considerable expense, three years ago- It is still, however, 
far from sufficient to supply the wants of the parish, and is very in- 
conveniently situated for those who dwell on the south sideof Knock- 
Farril, amounting to between 800 and 900, who in winter are often 
prevented from attending church by the steepness of the hill, 
and the depth of snow which at times lies upon it. There are full 
services, every Lord's day, both in Gaelic and English. There 
are no Dissenting or Seceding families in the parish. 

The manse was built in 1794, and is in excellent repair. It is 
surrounded with a glebe and garden, containing upwards of ten 
acres, the soil of which is, upon the whole, good. The stipend, by 
the last augmentation, obtained in 1824, is 16 chalders, partly 
money, and partly victual, exclusive of the legal allowance of 
L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. The Honourable Mrs Hay 
M'Kenzie of Cromartie is patroness. 

Mr Hector M'Kenzie, the first Presbyterian minister of the pa- 
rish, was inducted in 1728. He was succeeded by Mr Colin 
M'Kenzie in 1734, who died in 1801, at the advanced age of ninety- 



FODDERTY. 259 

four years. His son, Mr Donald M'Kenzie, had been previously 
appointed his assistant and successor, on whose death Mr Charles 
Bayne was inducted in 1826, and after him the present incumbent 
in 1833. 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish. 1. The 
parochial school, which has the maximum salary attached to it, 
exclusive of a dwelling-house, and L. 2, 2s. in lieu of a garden. The 
branches taught are, English reading, grammar,writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, geography, Latin, and Greek. The average attend- 
ance is 63, and the annual amount of school fees paid may be about 
L. 16. 2. The school at ToUie, in the Brahan district, in connexion 
with the Inverness Education Society. The attendance is 70. 
Both Gaelic and English are taught, together with writing and 
arithmetic. 3. The Gaehc school, supported by that excel- 
lent institution, the Gaelic School Society of Edinburgh, in which 
old and young are taught to read the sacred Scriptures in their own 
language, and which is attended during winter by about 60. 
4. The school at Maryburgh, on the scheme of the General 
Assembly's Education Committee. The average attendance is 120. 
And, lastly, a school on the teacher's own adventure, in the heights 
of Auchterneed ; at which the attendance is 84. 

Poor. — There are 96 on the poor's roll, who receive aid annually, 
besides 20 others, who are assisted occasionally. The funds are, 
1. The collections at church, averaging during the last five years 
L. 30, 7s. Id. Sterling, from which, however, the fees of session- 
clerk, precentor, beadle, and catechist are to be deducted. 2. 
A mortification i7i perpetuo by George Earl of Cromartie of 12 
bolls of barley per annum, bearing date 18th September 1686, 
and restricted " for the help, sustenance, and entertainment of 
the poor and indigent living on the lands of Park, Ardvall, Kinet- 
tas, Ulladale, Castle Leod, Auchterneed, Inchreundie, Glen- 
skyth, Garbet, and Bay of Dingwall, Strathpeffer, Inchrory, 
Dochnaclear, Fodderty, Balmulich, Milnain, but with preference 
still to decayed tenants, and their wives when widows." 3. A 
legacy of L. 80, left by Mrs Morrison, daughter of Mr Angus 
Morrison, the last Episcopal minister of Contin, who was ejected 
for non-conformity, and resided afterwards in this parish till the 
time of his death. By additions made to it, the legacy was in- 
creased to upwards of L. 200, and invested in the property of Hil- 
ton at 5 per cent, per annum ; but the interest has not been avail- 
able for the last few years.

THE REV. HECTOR M'LEAN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries. — The name of this parish is supposed to be of 
Danish origin. The parish has for its western boundary the 
Kyle, or narrow sea which separates the adjacent Island of Skye 
from the mainland ; the bays of Lochduich and Lochlong encom- 
pass it on the south ; and that range of high hills which divides 
the east from the west coast of Scotland, bounds it, on the east. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general appearance of the 
country is mountainous ; — but the hills are neither rocky nor co- 
vered with heath, as in the neighbouring country on the north. 
On the declivity of the smaller hills, and in the intermediate 
hollows, the soil is rich. On the top, they are covered with thin 
moss. The whole produces excellent pasture. The climate, as 
may be expected from the height of the hills, is exceedingly moist 
and rainy. 

Zoology. — Red-deer, mountain hares, and ptarmigan, frequent 
the higher hills. In the lower, may be found roes, foxes, black- 
cocks, grouse, plovers, partridges, eagles, and a variety of hawks. 
The migratory birds are the woodcock, lapwing, cuckoo, land- 
rail, swallow, and mountain-finch, or snow-flake. The sea coast 
.j abounds with a variety of water-fowl.f 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owner. — Mrs Lillingstone of Lochalsh is sole proprietrix 
of the parish, — the real rent of which is L. 3280, 12s. 6d. 

Parochial Register. — A register of births and marriages has 
been kept in the parish, since the year 1820. In 1836, the num- 
L ber of births registered was 33 ; of marriages, 7. 

Within the last forty years, very great improvements have taken

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. DAVID GARMENT, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — " The name of this parish," says the writer of the last 
Statistical Account, " seems to be derived from the Gaelic word 
Coinneamh, signifying a meeting or junction ; and Ross-coinneamh 
may denote the place where the districts of Easter and Wester 
Ross join, — which is the western boundary of this parish, and 
where the inhabitants might occasionally assemble." 

Extent and Boundaries. — This parish is situated on the northern 
shore of the Frith of Cromarty. It is supposed to extend in 
length, from south-east to north-west, from 25 to 30 miles; its 
greatest breadth is about 12 miles. It is bounded on the east by 
the parish of Kilmuir ; on the west by Alness ; on the north by 
the parish of Kincardine and Edderton ; and on the south by 
the Frith of Cromarty. 

Topographical Appearances. — That part of the parish which 
lies along the coast, is level. The ground rises from the sea coast 
with a gentle acclivity, for a distance of about four miles; after 
which, it becomes hilly. The hills, however, are not in general 
of remarkable height. The highest is Cairn Coinneag, It is si- 
tuated on the confines of the parish, where it borders on the north- 
west with Kincardine and Alness, and is supposed to be about 

4

3000 feet above the level of the sea. In the interior of the pa- 
rish, at a distance of about seven miles from the coast, there is a 
very extensive strath called Strathrusdale, used chiefly for sheep 
pasturage. 

Meteorology, tc. — The climate is dry, temperate, and salubrious. 
The temperature in summer rarely exceeds 80° Fah. in the shade, 
and in winter it seldom ftills below 14°. The climate sometimes 
varies a little in different parts of the parish, " for all kinds of 
farm-work can be carried on in the lower part of the parish, when 
in the heights the operations are interrupted by hard frost or a 
fall of snow." 

Hydrography. — This parish, as we have already mentioned, is 
situated on the northern shore of the Frith of Cromarty, and is 
bounded by it for a distance of nearly six miles. The frith" finds en- 
trance between the two hills known by the name of the Sutors of 
Cromarty, and runs up into the country a distance of about twenty 
miles, and is almost surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills, be- 
tween which and the shore lies a well-wooded and fertile country. 
The scenery of the frith is remarkably fine. From the Ness of 
Invergordon, the spectator can, on a clear summer evening, obtain 
a view of rarely equalled beauty. Looking to the east, across the 
broad waters of the Moray Frith, " the finest water piece in Bri- 
tain," he can discern in the distance, skirting the horizon, the dis- 
tinctly defined coast of Moray ; nearer, he beholds the Sutors of 
Cromarty, uprearing themselves on either side of the gateway 
through which the waters of the Frith enter, and which, imme- 
diately within these natural barriers, expand into a broad and 
beautiful bay, with the sweetly situated town of Cromarty on the 
south side, and on the north a rich and fertile country, with a mag- 
nificent back-ground of hills. Turning his eyes westward, he sees 
the calm and peaceful frith stretching up farther than the eye can 
well reach, and bordered on the north side by a stripe of richly 
wooded and comparatively level country; in the distance maybe 
perceived the mountain monarch Ben Wyvis, raising high into the 
clear blue air his snowy summit, and surrounded by a hundred 
ancient hills, like so many chiefs round their sovereign ; while to 
the south-west, the view is bounded by the huge and many-peak- 
ed Ben Vaichard. The general depth of the frith is from 15 
to 20 fathoms ; it preserves this depth for 12 or 14 miles ; but after 
that, it shoals considerably. It is navigable, however, at full tide, 
for vessels of considerable size, to its furthest extremity. 



IIOSS AND CROMARTY. 



Lakes. — There are four fresh water lakes in tliis parish, — Loch 
Achnacloich, Patavieg, Coinneag, and Charnac. None of them 
is of any great extent, the hirgest not exceeding half-a-mile in 
length. The only one of them which merits notice on account of 
its scenery, is Achnacloich. It is situated in a -small but beautiful 
and secluded glen. At the lake's eastern extremity, there is a 
lovely sylvan amphitheatre, from whence a view] can be command- 
ed of almost unrivalled majesty. Standing in this sequestered 
spot, surrounded on three sides by wood, the spectator has imme- 
diately before him the quiet lake, bordered by its beautiful fringe 
of birch and alder; while, to the west, may be seen a wilderness of 
hills, stretching to an apparently interminable distance, and heap- 
ed together in seemingly chaotic confusion, Ben Wyvis .with its 
" diadem of snow," proudly towering above them all. 

Rivers. — The only stream of any magnitude connected with 
this parish, is the water of Alness, which forms the boundary be- 
tween this and the neighbouring parish of Alness. It is a wild 
and romantic river, apd will very amply repay the lover of the pic- 
turesque, for his trouble in visiting it. There is one place, in par- 
ticular, on the banks of the river called ToUie, which is of surpas- 
sing beauty, and affords not a few scenes worthy of the painter or 
the poet. 

The river of Balnagown, which falls into the bay of Nigg, has 
its source in this parish. 

Geology and Miner aJocjij. — A large part of the parish is com- 
posed of that red sandstone referred by geologists to the old red 
sandstone formation. In the upper part of the parish, the soil is 
a clayey loam incumbent on the red sandstone, and containing a 
number of rolled blocks of coarse granite, gneiss, &amp;c. In the 
lower part, the soil varies, considerably, " being partly gravelly 
and light, partly loam, and some a deep and strong clay." In the 
middle of the parish, on the property of Culcairn, there is a very 
extensive bed of shell marl, amounting to perhaps from fifty to 
seventy acres. It is, however, little, if at all, used, — as lime, which 
is preferred, can be obtained easily, and at a moderate price. 
There are large tracts of moss in the parish, in which considerable 
quantities of fir and oak are found imbedded. 

Zoology, — Of quadrupeds common to the parish, we may men- 
tion the red-deer {Cervus elaphus, the roe C. capreolus, the fox 
{Canis vidpes, the badger  Ursits meles, the weasel [Mustela vul- 
garis, the marten M./yzno, the polecat {M. putorius, theot-

{Lepus timidus, the alpine hare {L. variabilis, the rabbit [L. 
cunicuhis, the mole {Talpa Europea, the bat Fespertilio. 

Birds. — Of birds which either occasionally visit us, or are na- 
tives to the parish, we may mention the following : The royal or 
golden eagle {Falco chrysaetos, the peregrine or common falcon 
{F. peregrinus, the Iceland falcon {F. islandicus, the sparrow- 
hawk {F. nisus, the glead F.milviis, the hen-harrier {F. cyaneiis, 
and several other varieties. The owl Strix jlammed, the raven 
{Corvus corax, the hooded, royston, or grey -crow C. comix, 
the rook C. fnigilegus, the jackdaw or daw C. monedula, the 
magpie C. pica, the starling {Stiirnus vulgaris, the greater but- 
cher-bird {Lanius excubitor, the throstle or song-thrush {Turdus 
musicus, the fieldfare {T. pilaris, the blackbird {T. merula, the 
stonechat Motacilla rubicola, the water wagtail {M. alba, the 
lark {Alauda arvensis, the bullfinch {Loxia pyrrhida, the chaf- 
finch {Fringilla coelebs, ihe goldfinch {F. carduelis, the cuckoo 
{Cuculus canorus, the kingfisher {Alcedo ispida, the swallow Hi- 
rundo rustica, the goat-sucker, fern-owl, or nightjar {Caprimid- 
gus Furopmis, the wood-pigeon {Columba palumbus, the black- 
cock {Tetrao tetrix, the ptarmigan {T. lagopus, the moorfowl 
T.Scoticus, the partridge T.perdix, the Tp\o\er Charadrius plu- 
vialis, the lapwing Tringa vanellus, the heron {Ardea cinerea, 
the woodcock {Scolopax rusiicola, the curlew S. arquata, the 
snipe S. gallinago, the corncrake {Rallus crex, the sea-gull 
{Lai-vs camis. Large flocks of wild geese and ducks used during 
the winter months to frequent the Frith, but of late years they 
have almost entirely disappeared. To what cause this is to be at- 
tributed we know not. 

Fishes.— In the frith, are found cod, coal-fish, skate, flounders, 
and salmon. Of old, haddocksnd whitings were also found, but 
they have for many years almost totally disappeared. This' has 
led to the conjecture, hat the bed of the frith is becoming gra- 
dually more muddy. Herring used also to enter the frith, but 
they have long ago totally deserted it. Of shell-fish, we may men- 
tion the cockle {Cardium edule, mussel {Mijtilus edulis, limpet 
{Patella vulgaris, razor fish, &amp;c. Very fine oysters {Ostrea edu- 
lis are found by dredging. 

Botany.~T\ie parish possesses few,, if any, rare plants. There 
are very extensive plantations, consisting chiefly of larch and 
Scottish firs ; but the latter greatly predominate. There is alsa

ROSS AND CIIOMARTY. 



a very considerable quantity of hard-wood, elm, beech, ash, oak, 
plane and lime trees, &amp;c. besides natural woods of birch and 
alder. Altogether, there may be in the parish about 3000 acres 
under wood. On the estate of Ardross, the property of the Duke 
of Sutherland, there are some very noble trees.- We may mention 
especially two magnificent oaks. Their dimensions are ; of the one, 
girth at base, 10 feet, — at 5 feet from the ground, 8 feet 4 : it 
rises beautifully straight, for about 25 feet, before it begins to taper 
much, and may be altogether from 50 to 70 feet in height. Of the 
other, girth at base, 11 feet 6; it preserves nearly the same thick- 
ness for 12 or 15 feet, and then branches off into two enormous 
arms. These trees are supposed to be about 300 years old, and 
are, of course, as yet in the prime of their age. We may mention 
also an uncommonly large fir tree, which measures round the base 
about 11 feet. At the height of a few feet from the ground, it 
branches off into a number of arms, each about the size of an or- 
dinary tree. One of these large branches was singularly enough 
broken off a few winters ago, by the weight of a quantity of snow 
which had accumulated upon it. There are several other very 
fine firs, averaging 7 feet in girth, with the main stem rising 60 or 
70 feet in height. 

II. — Civil History. 
Historical Notices. — In September of the year 1675, Mr 

' S/icej Insurrection, 1792 In summer 1792, some slieep-farmers in the parish 

of Ahiess took upon them to poind, for an alleged trespass, the cattle of the Ardrcss 
tenants in this parish. The people collected in a body, in order to release the cattle, 
alleging that they were wrongously poinded, as the hills in question, on which their 
cattle were pasturing, had, from time immemorial, belonged to, and were in possession 
of, the tenantry of Ardross and Strathrusdale. The sheep-farmers rather imprudent- 
ly met the people with fire-arms, supported by their shepherds and servants ; but they 
were instantly disarmed by the people of Ardross. An old man still living, a man 
then in the prime of life, and of great strength and stature, was the principal instru- 
ment in closing instantaneously with, and disarming the shepherds, before they could 
use their fire-arms, even if so inclined. The gentlemen shepherds were thus compelled 
to submit to the people, and to liberate the cattle. In the month of July of that 
year, and soon after the above affray had taken place, at a wedding in Strathrusdale, 
as the people's minds were irritated by the recent occurrence, and as the sheep-farm- 
ing system vas progressing in every corner of the North Highlands, and the people 
driven year after year from the fields of their fathers, — their minds were exasperated 
at what they deemed oppression, and thus were ready to adopt any course, however 
violent, which they foolishly thought would rid tliem of sheep and sheep-farmers. It 
was therefore resolved at this wedding, that messengers should be dispatched to every 
corner of the country, to raise the war-cry against sheep and sheep-farming. The 
people were easily excited in such a case, and they collected in great numlers, and 
were driving the sheep out of the country, when, after reaching the parish of Alness, 
they were met by a party of the 42d Regiment, from Fort George, when Ihcy were 
compelled to disperse and seek safety in flight. Several of the persons concerned 
were apprehended afterwards, and tried before the Circuit Court at Inverness, m 
September 1792. There is one striking feature in this case, characteristic of a High- 
land mob, which strongly exemplifies their high moral principles, even when excited 
and roused by oppression to an illegal act ; no sheep was injured, no lamb was hurt, 
by overdriving.

M'Killigen, formerly minister of Fodderty in Wester Ross, cele- 
brated the communion at Obsdale, in this parish, in the house of 
the Lady Dowag-er of Foulis. " There assisted him," says Wod- 
rovv, " Mr Hugh Anderson, minister of Cromarty, and Mr Alex- 
ander Fraser, minister at Teviot, afterwards at Abbotshall." There 
was, it appears, on this occasion " such a plentiful effusion of the 
spirit, that the eldest Christians there declared they had not been 
witnesses to the like." The ministers engaged in this solemnity 
experienced a remarkable preservation ; for a party of soldiers was 
sent by Sir Roderick M'Kenzie of Findon, to apprehend Mr 
M'Killigen, who had rendered himself particularly obnoxious to 
those in power. " Expecting he would have dispensed the sacra- 
ment at Alness, the place of his residence, the party came thither, 
upon the Lord's day, and missing him, they fell a pillaging his or- 
chard, which kept them so long, that before they could reach Obs- 
dale, the forenoon's work was over, and upon notice given, the 
ministers retired. After the party went off, the ministers and peo- 
ple met again in the afternoon, and had no more disturbance." 
An old natural fir tree still marks the spot, and it is worthy of 
note, that the traditional account preserved in the parish of this 
event, accords in every particular with that given by Wodrow. 

Eminent Mew.— William Macintosh, the aijthor of Travels in 
Europe, Asia, and Africa, and other literary works, was born at 
Newmore, in this parish, in the year 1 738. He was the son of 
Lachlan Macintosh, a descendant of the family of Macintosh of 

Balnespick, in Badenoch, and of Macpherson, of the same 

family as Sir John Macpherson, at one time Governor of India. 
This branch of the family of Macintosh had, however, been for 
some time settled in Ross- shire ; and in Alness church-yard, the 
graves of John Macintosh and Janet Montgomery of Kiltearn his 
spouse, the grandfather and grandmother of William Macintosh, 
are still to be seen. William went, when young, to the West Indies, 
where he realized a considerable property,— but shortly after his re- 
turn to Europe, about 1775, he embarked for the East Indies, where 
he resided for several years. He published a very amusing account " 
of his travels and adventures in the East, which is remarkable as 
.originally propounding, and foretelling the ultimate adoption of, 
almost all the theoretical views and precepts which have subse- 
quently been carried into practice by various British statesmen in 
the administration of our East Indian possessions. This work was 
published in English anonymously, by Mr Macintosh ; and it is 



2G8 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



probably owing to this circumstance, that his name has failed to 
be associated, as it deserves, with the more enlightened views 
which have, from time to time, been adopted in the government of 
our eastern possessions. In the French translation of Mr Macin- 
tosh's Travels, his name, however, appears, and lie is fully recog- 
nized as the author of the work. It is on this circumstance, that 
Mr Macintosh's claims to public notice chiefly rest. On his re- 
turn from the East, Mr Macintosh took up his abode in the south 
of France ; but, on the breaking out of the French Revolution, his 
house was attacked and sacked by the republicans, and the same 
fate awaited him at Avignon, in the Pope's states, where he had 
sought refuge, when the French forces invaded Italy. The cause 
of this hostility is not known ; but it is not a little remarkable, that 
when Napoleon visited Erfurth, in 1808, he found Mr Macintosh, 
then far advanced in years, residing in Eisenach in Saxony; and 
the immediate result was his arrest and incarceration in a dungeon, 
till such time as the Corsican had departed from Germany. Mr 
Macintosh was, however, seized, in consequence, with an illness, 
which terminated his life in 1809. 

George Macintosh, the younger brother of William, who was 
also born at Newmore, was destined by Providence to distinguish 
himself in a different field of exertion. In early life, he settled as 
a merchant in Glasgow, where he married a lady of the name of 
Moore, sister of Dr Moore, the author of Zeluco and other li- 
terary works of eminence, and the aunt of the celebrated General 
Sir John Moore. Mr Macintosh soon became conspicuous for in- 
dustry and intelligence in the line of his business, and zealously 
devoted his talents and exertions to the promotion of those branches 
of manufacture, in which chemical science constitutes a dist.n- 
suishing feature. He established in Glasgow the manufacture of 
a species of orcella or orseille, called cudbear, and introduced into 
Britain the branch of trade known as the Turkey or Adrianople 
red dye, and which has subsequently exerted so powerful an intlu- 
ence on our calico-printing and cotton-spinning establishments. 
■ But in treating of this his native parish, and that, too, a High- 
land parish, it is to Mr Macintosh's devotion to the cause of 
the Highlands and of Highlanders, Avhich continued to animate 
and distinguish him through life, that the mind naturally reverts. 
The introduction of the improved system of farming into the High- 
lands, and in particular the system of sheep farming, soon opened, 
though indirectly, a field for the exercise of Mr Macintosh s be-

Iieficence and philanthropy. It is known that the emigration on 
an extensive scale, which resulted as a natural consequence from 
this change in Highland agriculture, was attended with sufferings, 
on the part of the emigrants, calculated to excite the sympathy 
even of indifferent observers. Numbers of the expatriated High- 
landers flocked to Glasgow, where Mr Macintosh's bountiful as- 
sistance was never denied them, and where his counsel and advice, 
of more value, probably, than mere pecuniary donations, were 
m addition tendered with equal willingness and zeal. In obtain- 
mg for his destitute countrymen, occupation in the walks of com- 
mercial and manufacturing industry, both in his own employment, 
and in other and distant situations, he was equally indefati- 
gable and successful. In the midst of these events, the war re- 
sulting from the French Revolution commenced; and Glasgow, 
under the influence of Mr George Macintosh, became °the 
scene of recruiting for the army on an extensive scale, from 
amongst the numbers of the Highland emigrants. His corre- 
spondence, which is still preserved, indicates no less his kindly 
anxiety for the real welfare of his countrymen, than it does a high 
tone of public spirit and patriotic feeling; but what is perhaps 
equally gratifymg, it demonstrates, aB expressed by many public 
functionaries, and individuals of rank and character, that the go- 
vernment of the day was sensible of the services which he ren- 
dered to his country, and duly appreciated the same. When war 
recommenced in 1803, it was mainly through his exertions that 
the Glasgow Highland Volunteer Regiment was raised and orga- 
nized ; and when, about this time, the regiment of Canadian Fen- 
cibles then stationed in Glasgow, evinced symptoms of mutiny, 
Mr Macmtosh, at the desire of General Wemyss, then command- 
ing the district, hastened to their quarters, and addressed the sol- 
diers in their native tongue ;— the effect was electrical. 

" With such autliority, tlie troubled host he swayed," 

that the corps, in the instant, M-eturned to their duty. In the 
midst of this useful and honourable career, Mr Macintosh was 
snatched from society, in the summer of 1 807. On his return from a 
journey mto England, he was seized with illness at Moffat, where he 
expired in the sixty-ninth year of his age. His ashes repose at a dis- 
tance from those of his fathers, in the cathedral burying-ground at 
Glasgow, m the tomb of the ancient familv of Anderson of Dow- 
hill, trom which his wife was descended. On Sunday, the 9th of 
August 1807, as a tribute of respect to Mr Macintosh's memory,

the gentlemen of the Highland Society, and of the Gaelic Club 
of Glasgow, preceded by the Lord Provost and Magistrates, and 
the boys of the Highland Society, one of the numerous charities 
which had flourished through his bountiful aid and protection, 
walked in procession to St Andrew's Church in Glasgow, where 
an excellent and an appropriate sermon was preached by the Rev. 
Dr Ritchie, from the text, 112th Psalm, verse 2d, "He hath dis- 
persed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness endureth for 
ever, his horn shall be exalted with honour." 

Mr George Macintosh left, with other children, a son Charles 
Macintosh, who still survives. He is also a merchant in Glasgow, 
and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In the walk of 
chemical manufactures, his reputation is perhaps second to no in- 
dividual in Europe. He is the inventor of the process for water- 
proofing fabrics, by the apphcation of Indian rubber. 

Land-owners. — The principal heritors are, the Duke of Su- 
therland ; M'Leod of Cadboll ; M'Leay of Newmore ; Hugh 
Rose Ross of Glastullich and Cromarty; and M'Kenzie of Kin-

Parochial Registers.— The registers of births and marriages 
both commence in 1781, and have been regularly kept. 

Antiquities.~\J nder this head, it may be mentioned, that, in a 
field a little to the west of the church, there is a singular upright 
stone, somewhat in the form of an obelisk, called Clacha Mhear- 
lich, i. e. the thief's stone,— which is evidently of very ancient 
date. Though in the midst of an arable field, it is most religious- 
ly preserved, no attempt being made to remove it, or alter its po- 
sition. None even of the oldest inhabitants are acquainted with 
any distinct tradition, respecting its origin or intention ; but, from 
the name, it is conjectured that some noted robber was buried be- 
neath it. A few years ago, there were found, on the farm of Miln- 
craig, in a bank of red gravel, about eight feet below the surface, 
two stone coffins. They contained, we believe, nothing but a fe\v 
bones.— There are in this parish a number of cairns. Many of 
them have been greatly diminished in size, by the stones of which 
they were composed being taken away, and used in the erection 
of dikes, and other buildings. Some of them have been, by this 
means, gradually removed entirely. There is a very large one in 
the neighbourhood of Loch Achnacloich. It is surrounded by an 
outer circle, composed of stones, a few yards asunder, and mea- 
surin.. in circumference 130 yards. All around, there is a great

number of tumuli; but none of them have, so far as we know, been 
opened. In effecting some improvements, a few years ago, on the 
farm of Ardross, it was found necessary to remove one of these 
cairns; but the people had a tradition that « the plague was buried 
under it," and refused to touch it ; and it was with no small diffi- 
culty, that they were at length induced to assist in its removal. On 
the summit of a wooded hill called Knock Navie, there is a cairn 
named Carna na Croiche, i. e. the cairn of the gallows. The tra- 
dition connected with it is, that some men who were travelling 
being weary and faint with hunger, as they passed Achnacloich, 
stopped and asked the woman who had charge of the laird's dairy 
tor some cheese and milk to allay their hunger, offering at the 
same time to pay for it. She, however, refused to give it • 
upon which, the men took it, laid down money for it, and went 
away. The women immediately informed the laird of the cir- 
cumstance, who being a man of a fierce and savage disposi- 
tion, sent after the travellei's, brought them back and hanged 
them on the spot now marked by the cairn. In some of the cairns 
which were removed, sculls and bones of a very large size were 
tound One of these cairns bears the name of Carna nam Fiann, 
. e. the cairn of the Fingalians. There are, also, several small en- 
closures, which appear to have been places of sepulture. The 
most perfect of these is of an oblong form, about twelve or four- 
teen feet long, and two or three feet in breadth. It consists of a 
large and massive flat stone placed upright at the head,— while on 
either side, there are three or four similar stones placed in a line 
but none at the foot. It was, we believe, originally roofed over,' 
the entrance bemg at the open end ; but it was, several years aao 
cons,dei-a injured by some masons, who wished to obtain t1.e 
stones for bmlding a house in the vicinity. There is no tradition 
connected with it : it is too old for tradition. 

Modern Buildings -e have few, if any, very modern erec 
tions which are worthy of notice. Invergorden Caslle, a fine build- 
ing, was some years ago destroyed by fire. The walls are still 
standing ; but no attempt has been made to repair it, and the fa- 
mily reside m one of the wings. It is surrounded by' very beaul 
ful and extensive pleasure grounds.- There is a new, large, and 
very complete mill at Dalmore,-which contains a flour-mill, bar- 
ley-mil meal-mill, thrashing-mill, and saw-mill. There is also a 
saw-mill on the banks of the river Alness, which cuts annually a 
very considerable quantity of wood.

The population of the parish, as returned to Dr Webster in 175.5, was 1958 souls. 

The population in 1801. 2074 

181 1 2.390 
1821 2581 
18.31 2916 

According to an accurate private census taken a few years ago, 
the population was 3010. The difference between this and the 
Government census is easily accounted for by the fact, that the 
latter included those only who were on the spot, whilst the former 
included all who belonged to the parish, whether present or ab- 
sent, and many of the parishioners go during the summer months 
to other places for work. In the country part of the parish, the 
population has decreased, while in the villages there has been a 
corresponding increase. This is to be attributed to the doing away 
of the middle class of tenants, and merging their small into large 
farms.

There are at present in the parish, insane, 1 ; fatuous, 10 ; blind, 2 ; deaf and 
dumb. 1. 

Clans. — The principal clans in this parish are, the Rosses and 
Munroes. The number of John Rosses and Donald Munroes 
is quite astonishing, and might prove at first not a little perplex- 
ing to a stranger, until he became acquainted with the bynames or 
patronymicks which serve to distinguish them from each other. 

The language generally spoken is the Gaelic, but it has decid- 
edly lost ground within the last forty years. In the villages, es- 
pecially, the English is making rapid progress. 

Habits, Customs, c. of the People. — The people seem to be 
very little addicted to games or amusements of any kind. For- 
merly there used to be a great turn out on new-year's-day, old 
style, for playing at shinty ; but the practice has now almost totally 
died away. 

" Connected with this great Highland game, we may relate the following tradi- 
tional story : Rather more than a century ago, it was the practice for the people to 
meet at Ardross, in the heights of the parish, on Sunday, to play at shinty. When 
Mr Bethune was settled as minister of the parish in 1717, this practice was one of 
the first things which caught his attention, and which he determined to put a stop 
to. The way he managed to do so, was this : Tiicrc was a certain man noted for 
activity and strength, who was the chief and leader of the shinty players. Rlr Be- 
thune sent for this man. and proposed to make him an elder. The man was at first, 
naturally, not a little surprised at this proposition, but after some persuasion con-

It is remarkabla, that the people here seem to have few, if any, bal- 
lads or old Gaelic songs, such as there are in other parts of the 
Highlands. The ordinary food of the peasantry is oatmeal and 
potatoes, chiefly the latter. The people are in general acute and 
intelligent, moral and attentive to the ordinances of religion. The 
Sabbath is well observed.— Smuggling is nearly extinct.— Poach- 
ing does not prevail to any extent. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Econormj.—The number of imperial acres 
in the parish under cultivation, is about 3900. The number 
of acres which never have been cultivated and remain constantly 
waste or in pasture, may be stated at 30,000. The number of 
acres under wood is about 3000. The extent of ground capable 
of improvement, with a profitable application of capital, is very li- 
mited, and is gradually being brought into tillage. 

Rent of Land.— The average rent of arable land per acre, is 
about L.1, 5s.,- though some of it is as high as L.2, 15s. The 
total rental of the parish may be stated at above L. 7000. 

Rate of Day-labourers receive Js. per diem all the 

year round, and women 6d. except in harvest, when men receive 
Is. 6d. and women Is. Farm-servants receive in general per an- 
nuni L.6 m money, and six bolls of meal, besides potatoes and 
fuel. 

Lwe-StocL—Theve are various breeds in the parish of black- 
cattle, chiefly the Highland. Those kept for dairy purposes are, 
m many instances, Ayrshire and Buchan. Teeswater have also 

o nn i"'"' '' """"lly gd in the parish 

about 3500 sheep; of these, 3000 are Cheviot, the remainder black- 
laced. The Leicester breed have also been tried on a small scale 
on one farm, but, owing to the coldness of its soil, they have not 
thriven well. A considerable number of pigs is reared in the pa- 
rish. There are also some goats in the heights. We may men- 
tion that there is a cattle-show, and also an exhibition of grain, 
held annually at Invergordon, when a number of premiums are 
awarded,-at the one, for the best specimens of the different kinds

of Uve-stock, and at the other, for the best samples of the differ- 
ent kinds of grain. These exhibitions cannot fail to be attended 
with the most beneficial effects. 

Husbandry, — The general character of the husbandry pursu- 
ed may be said to be the five years rotation." The land is, in 
general, in a high state of cultivation, and capable of little farther 
improvement. It is said, that about L. 12,000 has been, of late 
years, expended on one farm alone, Ardross, in liming, draining, 
&amp;c. ; and a very fine farm it now is. The general duration of 
leases is nineteen years. The farm buildings are, in most instan- 
ces, of a very superior description. The improvement which the 
parish has undergone, within the last forty years, may be learned 
from the fact, that, according to the last Statistical Account, the 
rental was then only L. 2000, whereas it is now L. 6000 and up- 
wards. 

Quarry. — There is a fine quarry of red sandstone on the banks 
of the water of Alness. 

Fisheries. — There are four stake-nets for the fishing of salmon 
in that part of the frith which bounds the parish ; but, as may be 
guessed from the rent, which is only L.45 per annum, they are 
not very productive. Salmon are also caught by means of cruives 
on the water of Alness, but not in any number. 

Produce. — The gross amount of raw produce raised in the pa- 
rish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, is as follows : 

The wheat, barley, and oats in the following table, it is proper 
to mention, are set down at an average of the fiars prices for the 
last seven years. 

Wheat, 400 acres, at  quarters per acre, at L.  8.s. per quarter, - L. 2400

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, - L, 12,921 

Manufactures. — There are two hemp-manufactories in the pa- 
rish, wliich together give employment to about 70 people, who 
receive each from 9s. to 12s. per week; besides the spinning, 
which occupies a great number of females, in the vicinity of the 
village of Invergorden. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication.— There are, as has been already men- 



KOSSKEEN. 275 

tioned, three villages in this parish, the largest of which, Inver- 
gorden, contains 1000 inhabitants. It is equidistant from the burgh 
towns of Tain and Dingwall, and is altogether most centrically situ- 
ated. Few places, indeed, seem to possess such natural advan- 
tages for becoming a place of trade and commerce. It enjoys 
the most ample means of communication, by means of coaches 
and steamers. The north and south mails pass daily through Inver- 
gorden. The Duchess of Sutherland, a new and magnificent steamer, 
plies once a fortnight to London, and a large sum has been already 
subscribed, for building another for the same station; The Bril- 
liant steam-ship plies regularly, during the summer, once a week, 
between Invergordon and Inverness, Aberdeen and Leith ; and the 
Velocity once a , fortnight. A number of, years ago, a boat-slip 
was erected at Invergordon, and a few years ago, a fine pier for 
large vessels was also erected. A wooden jetty was last year added 
to the pier, with a view to command ten feet water, at ebb-tide ; 
but, from the absurd manner in which it has been constructed, it 
has, since its erection, been found to be of not the smallest use. ' A 
considerable quantity of grain is shipped annually at this port for 
Leith and London ; but we have been informed that, were it not 
that the shore dues are twice as high as at any other port, the amount 
shipped would perhaps be treble what it now is. It would cer- 
tainly be for the benefit, both of the place and of the proprietor, 
were the shore dues reduced to a reasonable rate. We may men- 
tion, that, from the 8th March to I2th August 1836, 150 bul- 
locks, and 746 sheep and lambs were shipped at Invergordon, by 
the London steamer for that port. There is also a harbour at 
Dalmore, at which a very considerable quantity of timber, chiefly 
fir, is annually shipped for the north of England. There are se- 
veral roads of many miles extent, in this parish, all of them in 
excellent condition. 

Ecclesiastical State.~The church is situated in the centre of the 
parish and Its situation is most convenient so far as population is con- 
cerned. The district of Ardross is, indeed, distant from the church • 
but the modern system of large farms has reduced the population 
greatly mthatextensiveHighlanddistrict, so that, where the prayers 
and praises of apious peasantry were once heard echoing through the 
glens of their native hills, now, nothing is heard but the bleating of 
sheeporthebarkof the shepherd's dog. But,of apopulation ofrather 
more than 3000, about 2800 are within three or three and a-half 
miles of the parish church,-which to the hardy Highlander is only

a pleasant walk. The parish church, which is perhaps the most 
comfortable and commodious in the north of Scotland, was built 
in 1832, after a legal contest before the Court of Session for nearly 
two years, arising out of the opposition of a minority of the heritors, 
some of whom have since ceased to be heritors, — the late Duke of 
Sutherland having, a few years ago, purchased the far greater por- 
tion of the inland or Highland districts of the parish. The church 
is seated for 1360 persons, and may contain about 1600, if closely 
occupied. The attendance on the Sabbath may be reckoned at 
from 1200 to 1400. We have no Dissenters of any kind or class, 
if we except three individuals, who occasionally attend church. 
As for voluntaries we know nothing about them ; they cannot 
vegetate here. The Eghland soil does not seem favourable to the 
growth of voluntaryism. We do at times get a solitary importation 
from the south, but they do not thrive, and become quite quiescent 
after a few months residence in the north. We sometimes, too, 
are visited by a kind of itinerant Independents, who baptise the 
children of all and sundry who apply to them, whether the parents 
be church members or not. The population of Ardross, though 
removed, at a distance of from six to twelve miles, from the parish 
church, in general attend regularly, even in winter. The sittings are 
or ought to be free ; but it is believed that the feuars in the diffe- 
rent villages, do pay a small sum annually for their sittings,— which 
is not, however, given to the poor, as it is thought it should be. 
The manse was built in 1 825, and is large and commodious. There 
are two small glebes, one adjoining the manse, of four English 
acres, of good and fertile soil,— the other is contiguous to the ruins 
of an old kirk, called Noinikil, the cell or chapel of St Ninian, 
and consists of about an acre and a-half, in three different divisions, 
which are let by the minister to a tenant in the neighbourhood. 
How this glebe came to be so curtailed, cannot now be ascertained. 
There is no grass glebe, — which is felt to be a serious inconvenience ; 
but the ministers of Rosskeen seem to have disliked litigation, and 
to have submitted to privations, rather than claim, at the risk of 
an expensive law-suit, what was their undoubted right. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, half meal half barley, and L. 10 for 
communion elements. An augmentation was given in 1822, dur- 
ing the life of the late incumbent ; but it was less than it would 
otherwise have been, from the cry of agricultural distress so called, 
which was particularly loud and lugubrious, at the period referred 
to ; whereas, we have thought that a very simple remedy might be

found for that distress, without injuring the tenantry, or curtailing the 
stipends of the clergy, and that is by lowering the rents, as has late- 
ly been done by a Noble proprietor in this parish. But 16 chalders 
in 182'2, and for some years after, were equal to 24 chalders for 
the last two or three years, and we have been simple enough to 
suppose, that the low price of grain furnishes an argument for 
the increase of the number of bolls awarded to the clergy, whose 
stipends have been so greatly reduced of late. Divine service 
is conducted in English and Gaelic. The ministers in this part 
of the country lecture and preach in Gaelic, each Lord's day, 
and also preach regularly an English sermon, that is, three dis- 
courses eaeh Sabbath, except for a part of the winter season ; and 
yet, we have cause to lament that real religion does not flourish, as 
might be expected M'here the truth is preached. The number of 
communicants is about 120. We have thus fewer communicants 
than our southern neighbours ; but we are inclined to believe that 
we have both more religion, and more morality, and are more in- 
clined to fear God, and honour the King, and less disposed to med- 
dle with those who are given to change. But still, we must confess 
that there is a manifest departure, among all ranks, from that strict- 
ness and integrity, and genuine holiness, which in the olden time 
characterized the natives of our northern clime. We would pray 
for a revival of religion in every corner of our land. 

There is an Association for religious purposes in this parish, 
which since its estabUshment, about thirteen years ago, has given 
upwards of L. 500 to various societies, — Bible, Missionary, and 
Educational. 

Succession of Ministers.— It appears from the records of the 
presbytery of Tain, which commence in 1707, that the Episcopal 
incumbent of Rosskeen retained his living through the influence, 
as is supposed, of the Jacobitical gentry in the parish and neigh- 
bourhood. In the presbytery records, there is not even an allusion 
to the parish of Rosskeen, until the death of the Episcopalian in- 
cumbent in J 714 ; and then the parish is noticed, and active exer- 
tions made to secure a pious and efficient minister. The person 
chosen was Mr Daniel Bethune, minister of Ardersier, who was 
inducted into Rosskeen, on the 23d April 1717. He was a man 
eminently pious and successful in winning souls to Christ. He died 
the 16th March 1754. He was succeeded by his son, John Be- 
thune, a man celebrated for his literary attainments, and ho- 
noured with the degree of D. D,, a distinction which seldom falls to

the lot of Highland clergymen, owing, we suppose, to their su- 
perior modesty and self-denial, rather than to their inferior at- 
tainments, or because their metropolitan brethren are more ready 
to monopolize these honours than to bestow them on those who, 
when out of sight, are out of mind, except when a vote to pro- 
mote a party or partial object is required. • We have seen two vo- 
lumes of philosophical essays on various subjects by Dr Bethune. 
He died the 15th April 1774. He was succeeded by Mr John 
Calder, minister at Weem, in Perthshire, who is said to have been 
singularly pious, and possessed of very popular talents. He was 
inducted on the 24th September 1775, and died 1st June 1783. 
Mr Thomas Urquhart was inducted 1st September 1784 ; died 
17th May 1812. He was very much opposed at his induction, 
but is now generally said to have been a good and benevo- 
lent man, and of a meek and quiet disposition. Mr John Ross, 
minister of Logie Easter, was inducted 16th June 1813. He was 
a man of talent and sound evangelical views. He was translated 
to Rosskeen in his old age, much to the dissatisfaction of those he 
left, and of those among whom he was settled. He died 8th Fe- 
bruary 1824. Mr David Garment, the present incumbent, was 
translated from the New Gaelic Chapel, Duke Street, Glasgow, 
and admitted assistant and successor on the 14th March 1822. 

Education. — There are in the parish one parochial school, two 
supported by societies, and three by school fees, which are trifling, 
and also ill paid. The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum 
salary, and perhaps his fees do not exceed L. 3 per annum. There 
are also two Sabbath schools in the parish. 

Library. — A parochial library has been lately established, and 
seems to be already in a flourishing state. It is hoped that it will 
be the means of creating gradually, among the humbler classes of 
our population, a greater taste for reading than at present exists, 
and of thus aiding in the diffusion of useful knowledge. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid, is 140. The annual amount of contributions 
for their relief, arising from church collections, mortcloth money, 
&amp;c. is from L. 50 to L. 60. There is no assessment for the poor 

• It is a curious fact, tiiough sufficiently explained by what has been said above, 
that there is in this parish more than one person, who has seen every Presbyterian 
minister in it since the Revolution, The comfort which the present incumbent, 
wiien in rather a delicate state of health, some years ago, received from one of these 
octogenarians, was, that he had seen six ministers in Rosskeen, and very likely he 
would see the seventh.

in this part of the country, which lays often a heavy tax on the 
minister, especially when the heritors happen to be non-resident. 
Dr Whyte of Bombay, grandson of one of the former ministers 
of Rosskeen, left L. 2000 to the poor of the parish, the interest to 
be given, in certain specified proportions, to the modest poor. 

In general, none except the miserably poor ever think of apply- 
ing for parochial relief. 

Fairs. — There are five fairs, held annually at Invergorden ; in 
. February, April, August, October, and December. 

Inns. — There are no less than 24 inns and alehouses, 15 of 
which, by far too many, are in the village of Invergorden. Drunk- 
enness can, however, by no means be imputed as a general vice, 
to the people. 

Fuel. — The fuel used by the humbler classes is peats, of which 
abundance can be easily procured. By the wealthier inhabitants, 
coals English are used, as they can be obtained here at a very 
moderate price. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In many respects, this parish has been improved within the last 
forty years ; but the depopulation of the country by large farms, is a 
serious evil, and is likely to bring along with it consequences which 
the landed interest seem not to have contemplated. There is no long- 
er an independent peasantry. The morals of the people are deterio- 
rated by the loss of independence, and their spirits embittered by what 
they deem oppression. The ties which united master and tenant are 
severed ; and when the time comes, to which we look forward with 
fearful anticipations, it will, we fear, be found, that an error has 
been committed, by grasping too much, at the risk of sooner or 
later losing all.

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. CHARLES CALDER MACKINTOSH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Boundaries and External Appearance. — The parish of Tain, 
which is of a very irregular oblong figure, measures between 9 and 10 
miles in length from north-east to south-west. Its greatest breadth 
is about 4 miles, inclusive of a peninsula, which juts north-west- 
ward at the Meikle Ferry, above a mile into the sea ; exclusive of 
that peninsula, the breadth averages about 3 miles. On the east- 
ern side, the parish adjoins to those of Tarbat and Fearn ; on the 
west, to Edderton ; and on the south, to Loggie Easter ; while its 
northern boundary is formed by the waters of the Dornoch Frith, 
along which it stretches, with several curvings aud indentations, 
in a direction nearly east and west. The parish, as to its external ap- 
pearance, separates itself into three distinctly marked districts. The 
first is a low sandy plain, of about four or five square miles in extent, 
somewhat resembling in shape a crescent or quarter moon ; the 
lesser or inner curve of which, constituting as it does the present 
coast-line, may be described as an extended variously-broken sand 
bank, rising in several parts above the sea level to a height of about 
15 feet; while the large or outer curve is marked by a sudden ele- 
vation of the land, distinctly traceable almost from end to end of 
the parish, in many places about 30 feet above the flat plain be- 
low, — presenting the appearance of a scarp or slope ; on the ridge 
of which, about a quarter of a mile distant from the sea, and 
overlooking the wide-stretched flat beneath, is situated the royal 
burgh from which the parish is designated. Terrace-like, along 
the top of this escarpment, lies the second and most important di- 
vision of the parish; which, extending back towards the south- 
east, and upwards by a gentle slope towards the south and south- 
west, presents a highly cultivated and richly wooded territory to 
the view : while the third or upland district consists of several low

hills, forming part of a chain which constitutes the proper com- 
mencement of the Highlands, so called in relation to the greater 
part of Easter Ross. The Hill of Tain, the highest summit in 
the parish, has been calculated from barometrical observations to 
be about 780 feet above the level of the sea. 

Of the three districts above described, the first has, for a period 
far beyond the memory of man, been gradually lessening in 
consequence of a very perceptible yearly encroachment of the 
tide, more or less rapid in various parts, according to the nature 
and position of the soils it has had to remove or overflow. The ad- 
vance has been slowest over a portion of the plain situated at from 
two to four miles distance below the town, and known by the name 
of the Morrich mor ; which, accordingly, presents the appearance 
of a low promontory stretching far into the sea, as if to meet a 
somewhat similar headland,— the termination of a gently slopino- 
hill, on the opposite Sutherland coast. On that coast, too, a 
precisely similar process of encroachment has been going on ; so 
that, although the Frith now measures several miles across, the 
remarkable fact has been preserved by tradition, that it was at 
one time possible to effect a passage over it at low water upon 
foot, by means of a plank thrown across the channel, where 
narrowed to a few feet by the above-mentioned promontories, 
which stretch towards one another in the form of a lono- sand- 
bank, broken in a single place, to afford a waterway for the rivers 
of the frith. This bank still remains visible at ebb-tide, extend- 
ing its yellow line amid the blue element around it; and even 
when covered by the sea, it may yet be traced by the difference of 
hue: but when the waters are agitated by the gentlest breeze, or 
when a ground swell, precursive of a storm, rolls in from the Ger- 
man Ocean, then is the ear arrested at the distance of many miles 
by the hoarse dashing of the breakers, as they boil and foam over 
the Gizzen Briggs  in a long white band, amid the comparative 
calm of a shallow inland sea. 

iVam..._The Gaelic names of the burgh and parish are BaUc- 
Dhmch or Duthus' town, and SgircDuich, or Duthus' parish ; 
-so called from the patron saint.  The origin, however, of the

to the oldest orthography, Thayne, has long puzzled local etymo- 
logists. If we suppose it a corruption of a corrector form, Fayne, 
the most probable root would be the same with that of Fendom, 
in Gaelic na fana, the low grounds, being a part of the above- 
mentioned sandy plain in which the town, it is said, was anciently 
situated ; or, if a Scandinavian origin be allowed, the Norse word 
thanid, signifying stretched, extended, compare the Latin tendere, 
tenuis, and our own thin, affords a sufficiently plausible deriva- 
tion. The old Scottish title, Thane, seems an improbable etymon. 

Climate. — The climate of the parish shares the general charac- 
ter of mildness with the greater part of Easter Ross ; the cold of 
winter as well as the heat of summer being less intense than in 
many of the more southern districts of Scotland. The reason may 
perhaps be found partly in the general lie of the country, elevated 
itself but slightly, yet protected by the immediate neighbourhood 
of hills ; and partly in the nature of the soil, which, consisting 
chiefly of a loose alluvial mould, finely divided, we may add, by 
cultivation, seems fitted to resist any very sudden changes of tem- 
perature. The air is pure and salubrious, and the inhabitants in 
general healthy. In consequence, however, of our nearness to the 
coast, the easterly winds — especially prevalent in the end of spring 
—acquire a keenness that renders pulmonary and rheumatic com- 
plaints of rather frequent occurrence ; other endemic diseases 
there are none, and epidemics rarely spread even in the town to 
any considerable d egree. It may be mentioned, that during the 
prevalence of Asiatic cholera in Easter Ross, notwithstanding 
that it raged all around us, and especially in our own village of 
Inver to an unheard of extent, it did not enter the town at all. 

Hydrograjhy. — The Dornoch Frith, which forms the northern 
boundary of the parish, is formed by the river Shin and its tribu- 
taries, of which the channel may be distinctly traced all along to 
the Gizzen Briggs. This bar seems to mark the position of the 
coast line, as it existed ere the tide waves had yet spread them- 
selves over the surrounding plain. The breadth of the frith is 
about five miles immediately below the town ; but to such a 
distance does the sea retire at ebb-tide, that it then probably mea- 
sures scarcely three. The depth of the channel varies from seven 
fathoms, at the entrance, to two at the bridge of Bonar, to which 
point, a distance of fourteen miles, it may at high water be navi- 
gated : the navigation, however, is difficult, in consequence of the 
numerous concealed sand-banks, of which the older inhabitants

remember to have seer some in the form of islands, though they 
are now, except occasionally at low water, entirely covered by the 
encroaching sea ; and our only harbour is that afforded by the le- 
vel sands, left dry by the receding tide. At the north-western 
extremity of the parish, the frith suddenly narrows by the jutting 
forward of the two opposite headlands of the Meikle Ferry ; though 
immediately on, it again finds entrance into this and the adjoining 
parish, in the form of a bay called the Sands of.Edderton. 

We have no rivers, except an inconsiderable trout-stream, which 
we dignify with the name. The springs are numerous, especially in 
the uplands, and in the western part of the terrace district; which 
latter seems to owe its superiority over the eastern, in this respect, 
to the presence of an overlying stratum of gravel, there awanting. 
The water they afford is in general considered excellent, notwith- 
standing that they contain a large proportion of earthy matter in 
solution. Several in the upland district are weakly chalybeate, 
and are generally accounted medicinal, though rarely resorted to 
as such. Perhaps the most remarkable spring in the parish, is 
one called St Mary's Well, which is every day covered for seve- 
ral hours by the salt sea ; on the retiring of which, its refresh- 
ing waters may be procured. It was, of old, reckoned a specific 
remedy for consumption ; though we believe it was essential to its 
efficacy, that it should be drunk early in the morning, and upon the 
spot ; and as its very name sufficiently indicates a Roman Catho- 
lic age, we may probably enough trace in that belief, the/raw5 jomof a 
priesthood, anxious to secure to ecclesiastical benediction the honour 
due to the bracing influence of early rising, pure air, and exercise. 

Geoloffi/.— The oldest geological formations of the parish are 
entirely secondary ; the hills which constitute the upland district 
bemg composed wholly of sandstone, mostly white, though oc- 
casionally red : its strata are in some parts nearly horizontal ; 
but in others, as especially at the quarries on the hill of Tain, 
they dip eastward at an angle varying from 15° to 25°. The 
several hills present nothing remarkable in their external as- 
pect, but slope gradually down, until they blend almost imper- 
ceptibly with the lower or terrace lands ; saving only towards the 
western boundary of the parish, where this terrace formation has 
no existence, and the hill reaches to within a few yards of the 
bay already described under the name of the Edderton sands. 
Here, too, as well as farther east, the sea is at present slowly ad- 
vancing ; but evidently, this advance is not the first that it has made ; 



284

for the magnificent wall of rock, to near the base of which it has now 
attained, is manifestly the result of the action of the waves, at a pe- 
riod whose distance we have no data for calculating, beating, in their 
line of greatest advance, against this farthest projecting portion of 
the sandstone hill. The traveller along the high road westward, 
as he issues from a territory that promises little to excite admiration, 
is suddenly astonished to find himself walled in upon his left, by a 
lofty precipice consisting of immense masses of stratified stone, 
piled one upon another in regular ascent, by the giant hand of na- 
ture,— in one part cleft and scooped away into the form of a ra- 
vine, in another jutting directly out upon his path, and perhaps 
exciting a momentary shudder, as, looking up from beneath the spot, 
he beholds an enormous projecting mass seeming ready to tum- 
ble from its elevation of forty or fifty feet upon his head ; while 
at the same time, the rich clothing afforded by the ornamental trees 
with which nature and art have invested the once naked rocks, the 
ivy mantling, in many a place, over the surface of the steep, and 
everywhere here and there the birches that, rooted in the very edge 
of some beetling fragment, project their slight forms overhead, — 
confer an air of softness that renders it difficult to tell whether 
the prevailing character be the beautiful or the sublime. 

Over the sandstone formation now described, there lies a stra- 
tum of red clay, varying in depth from a few inches near the 
summit of the hill, to at least 50 or 60 feet, as descending sea- 
ward over the gentle slope of the middle district, we reach the 
ridge of the escarpment which separates it from the plain below. In 
this stratum it is, that we find boulders of most frequent occurrence, 
and that in greater abundance always, as we approach nearer the 
sandstone underneath, — whether by digging down to meet it, by 
ascending the hill to where it almost reaches the surface, or, last- 
y proceeding along the shore westward to where the sandy 
and terrace districts gradually dwindle away. These boulders, 
which are composed partly of gneiss, but chietly of a kind 
of granite, of which no rocks are to be found nearer than the 
western coast of Ross-shire, and which often attain a very large 
size, one block, especially, known as the Bit/ Stotie of Morangie 
containing at least 1400 or 1500 cubic feet, seem to have been 
carried hither after the deposition, but before the hardening of the 
clayey stratum. Immediately over it save that, in some places, 
a middle layer of gravel is interposed lies a rich soil, composed 
principally of a mixture of clay and sand, and capable of cultivation.

But, in the extensive low-ground which adjoins the sea, and 
which topographical appearances alone sufficiently indicate as the 
subject of a cyclical overflow and retrocession of the tide, other 
strata have found place. There is first a layer of peat-moss, 
varying from 10 to 18 inches in depth, the result apparently 
of the decomposition of a forest which once occupied the plain ; 
for both at the eastern boundary, where the moss reaches the 
surface, and is dug for fuel, as also along the course of " the river," 
when a freshet has washed away its channel to an unusual depth, 
and even where the tide now ebbs and flows, at low water, the 
roots of large trees, among which, oaks are said to be most fre- 
quent, are occasionally exposed. About the confines of this pa- 
rish with that of Fearn, there was lately found in the moss a 
bronze battle-axe, now in the possession of Mr Mackinlay of the 
Tarn Academy ; and in digging a new channel, a few years since, 
for part of the above-mentioned stream, a branching deer's horn 
of extraordinary size was exhumed. Above the moss, succeeds a 
stratum of fine sand, which constituted the bed of the sea when 
It last- covered this luniform plain, forming by the action of its 
waves the escarpment which bounds it ; thereafter, in the slow 
retiring of the water, the sandy level was left to view, to be 
in time covered by a cultivable alluvial soil ; but the tide is 
again advancing to re-shroud it with its mantle, and to reclaim 
Its own. Some parts, indeed, have been already wrested from 
the use of man, and converted into barren downs, by the sea 
sand with which they have been overblown ; especially the large 
district of the Morrich mor, which the older inhabitants re- 
member to have seen pastured as a common, and which was turn- 
ed it is said in a single night into an arid waste. All along the 
coast, the horizontal layer of shells, which the sea is uncovering 
m Its advance, distinctly marks the level of the bed which it for- 
merly occupied. Walking to the Morrich mor, our steps are on the 
remams of a former age, ground into powder by the tread of men; 
and where in some places the banks have been blown away by the 
wmd, a rich treasure of beautiful shells has been disclosed,— now, 
however, robbed of all its finest specimens, by frequent resort. 

Zoologrj.~li is not known whether any species of animals 
ormerly existing in the parish, have become extinct. At 
east one, however, which did not formerly exist in it, name- 
ly, tlie rat, has been introduced within the last few years, 
and has, to the annoyance of the inhabitants, rapidly multi-

plied. The Frith, properly so called, contains few important 
kinds of fish, with the exception of the salmon which pass up to 
the rivers ; all others, poor and sickly from the freshness of the 
water, are seldom sought for. Beyond the bar of the Gizzen 
Briggs, however, the waters abound with various species, of which 
the most important, in an economical view, are the cod, haddock, 
whiting, flounder, and skate ; to which may be added, the halibut, 
turbot, crowner, dog-fish, and many others, besides some small 
trout to be found in the streamlets of the parish. The principal 
shell-fish in the bay besides many that are less known are mus- 
sels, cockles, whelks, and crabs, all occasionally used as food ; but 
the mussel alone is turned to any great account, existing as it 
does in great abundance upon the sand-banks of the Frith, whence 
it is yearly removed by fishermen, to be employed for bait. While 
on this head, it may be mentioned, that a few years ago there 
were stranded, west of the town, on the grounds of Mr Ross of 
Cromarty, a number of large porpoises, amounting to about a hun- 
dred, which were frightened, it is supposed, into the bay by a 
thunder storm which had occurred the evening before. 

Woods. — Most of the wood grown in the parish is the Scotch 
fir, with occasional beltings of larch, elm, beech, ash, and birch. 
All of these species thrive well, except where exposed to the keen 
sea-breeze. The estate of Tarlogie contains the finest old trees 
in the parish, many of them of a venerable appearance and ma- 
jestic height. ' 

II. — Civil History. 
Ancient State of the Parish. — Tain appears to have been, in an- 
cient times, a place of considerable importance. From a well-authen- 
ticated document immediately to be mentioned, it is found that 
the Burgh dates its constitution from the latter half of the eleventh 
century, having been originally privileged by Malcolm Canmore, 
— a king celebrated as the successor of Macbeth, and son of the 
murdered Duncan ; celebrated, too, as the introducer of several 
new customs and dignities into Scotland ; — and claiming to 
be regarded farther as among the first  European sovereigns 
who adopted the enlightened policy of establishing free mu- 
nicipal corporations. At what period the town became an im- 
portant ecclesiastical seat, we know not, nor whether its connection 
with St Duthus who is said by Sir Robert Gordon, in his History 
of the Family of Sutherland, to have been Bishop of Ross about 

 See Robertson's Charles V. Introductory Treatise, notes 15—18. 



TAIN. 



287 



the year 1209, and to have been " a very godly man," had al- 
ready existed by any special pastoral tie during his own lifetime, 
or whether it was only after his death and canonization that he 
became " patron of St Duthus his chapel, beside the town of 
Tayn." We can only conjecture, therefore, that it may have been 
a chief seat of the Bishoprick of Ross, after its foundation by David 
I., the son of Malcolm, in the twelfth century. At all events, we 
learn from the same document already referred to, that the burgh 
was " under the special protection of the Apostolic See." 

Memorials of St Duthus. — In addition to the Gaelic appella- 
tions of the burgh and parish, several other names with us are 
compounded from that of the Saint. We have St Duthus' Fairs, 
St Duthus' Scalp, namely, the mussel-scalp, St Duthus' Cairn, 
St Duthus' Chapel, and St Duthus' Church ; besides that the 
burgh arms bear upon them the figure, and are inscribed with the 
title of Sanctus Diithacus. St Duthus' Chapel exists now only as 
a ruin, presenting a remarkable example of combined strength 
and simplicity of architecture. The materials of which it was 
built are of the granite blocks, with which the parish abounds, 
and of which our fences are still generally composed, cemented 
unsparingly with lime, which, having acquired a hardness scarcely 
inferior to that of the stone itself, has preserved much of the walls 
in a state of remarkable entireness, notwithstanding that they have 
stood roofless and exposed for full four centuries. How long pre- 
vious to this it had been built, and whether before or after the 
death of its patron saint, we know not. The ruins are situated 
on an eminence in the sandy plain, in which it has been mentioned 
that the town once stood. This edifice was of old a celebrated 
sanctuary, to which it is said that crowds used to resort; but, "as 
it has been remarked, that while " the evil that men do lives 
after them, the good is oft interred with their bones," so of the 
only three instances in which its use as such has been recorded, 
m two its sacred character was violated, and in the third it was 
made the instrument for the accomplishing of an evil design. 

The Jirst of these events was in the year 1306, when King 
Robert Bruce, whose fortunes were at this period reduced to their 
lowest ebb, had sent his queen and daughter for safety to the 
stronghold of Kildrummie in Marr ; whence, dreading a siege, 
they betook themselves by flight to St Duthus' sanctuary : but 
the then all-powerful Earl of Ross, deterred by no feelings of 
honour or of religion, seized their persons, and delivered them to 



288 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



the English. The queen did not recover her liberty until eight 
years thereafter.  

The second, though a less known circumstance in the history of 
our country, was of more importance in relation to our private 
concerns. There is related with great minuieness by Sir Robert 
Gordon, the history of an outrage by M'Niell, laird of Criech in 
Sutherland, who having had a quarrel with Mowat, laird of Freswick 
in Caithness, by chance encountered and defeated him in the 
year 1427 or 1429, and pursuing him to the chapel of St Du- 
thus at Tain, there slew both him and his company, and burnt 
the sanctuary. The popular tradition here is less circumstantial, 
having preserved only an outline of the facts, the atrocity of which 
it has considerably lessened. It states merely that some robbers 
had fled hither from the reach of justice ; and that their pursuers, 
to avoid a direct violation of the sanctuary, instead of forcibly 
dragging them from its covert, adopted the expedient of burning 
it over their heads. The tradition, at all events, accounts for what 
in the historical narrative appears a wanton act of impiety ; while 
the classical reader may be reminded of the somewhat similar 
evasion of direct sacrilege, which attended the death of Pausanias. 
After this disaster, the parish appears to have remained without a 
permanent place of worship for a period of more than forty years ; 
for St Duthus' Church dates from the year 1471. It is situated 
on the brink of the escarpment so often referred to, in the middle 
of the town ; which it would seem, therefore, had already changed 
its site. It is a large handsome building, so strongly constructed, 
that though the roof and interior have undergone many repairs, 
the walls promise to endure far longer than many of the most mo- 
dern erections. The windows are Gothic ; and there is placed 
outside, above one of the doors, a figure of St Duthus sculptured 
on stone in bas-relief; an inscription in church-text borders it all 
round, but is so effaced as to be illegible. 

The third event we have mentioned, was a pilgrimage of King 
James V. to St Duthus' sanctuary about the year 1527, and, 
therefore, a century after the burning of the chapel ; the former 
Statistical Account erroneously places it before it. The royal 
visitant, it appears, travelled barefoot ; and a rough footpath, 
leading across a moor in the upper part of the parish, and known 
by the name of the King's Causeway, — while it remains a proof of 



Il.iiles' Annals of Scotland. 



TAIN. 



289 



the uncivilized state of the country at that period, in that it possessed 
not a single available road in this direction,— remains a proof also 
of the then loyalty of the people, who hastily repaired to construct 
one for the accommodation of their king. Our gratification, 
however, is considerably lessened by knowing that the pilgrimage 
resulted from the instigation of James's Popish advisers, anxiots 
to remove him from the influence of any applications that might 
be made to him for the life of Hamilton, the Scottish proto- 
maj'tyr. 

Historical Documents.—The oldest existing charter of the 
burgh of Tain is one granted by James VI. in the year 1587 
followed by another in 1612. A third was afterwards issued by 
Charles 11. In these we find reference made to former charters 
granted by the ancient Kings of Scotland, which, it is said in the 
hrst of James VI. above-mentioned, " were cruelly burnt by bar- 
barians and cei-tain rebel subjects of Ireland per barbaros et quos- 
dam rebel es subditos HiberniE,J as has been manifestly proved to 
us by authentic documents produced before us;" and on this fact 
are these new grants of confirmation founded. What these an- 
thenttc documents were, we could have no room for conjecturing, 
but for a fortunate discovery made in the year 1826, of a notarial 
copy of what we have every reason to believe must have been one 
ot them, which now lies among the records of the Northern Insti 
tution at Inverness. Its authenticity is unquestionable; for it 
bears every internal mark of it. It is an inquest held «f Th

and prmleges of the burgh; which accordingly is found Thave

suppose that, for security's sake, the sanctuary may have been chos- 
en as the fittest place for the preservation of those documents, 
and that with it they may have perished. The high rank of the 
jurors sufficiently manifests the importance then attached by the 
country round to the full authentication of the burghal rights. 

Parochial Registers. — There are no trustworthy parochial regis- 
ters now extant, of a date beyond 1765 ; at which period we find 
it recorded that general discontent had been raised by the total 
want of any registration for nine years before ; since that time ex- 
cept that there is no record of deaths they have been tolerably 
well kept. The burgh records commence in 1734. 

Antiquities. — Almost the only antiquity worthy of note in the 
parish, besides the chapel and church of St Duthus above-men- 
tioned, is the beautifully carved oaken pulpit of the latter, which 
was gifted by " the good regent" Murray, to the inhabitants of 
Tain, for their zeal in the cause of the Reformation. In what 
this zeal was displayed, we know not ; we have learned only the 
gratifying fact ; and we know that it did not, as in other parts of 
Scotland, lead to the demolition or even to the defacement of 
the ancient church ; on which several Roman Catholic figures are 
still to be seen. We regret to state, however, that after St Du- 
thus' church was vacated, between twenty and thirty years ago, it 
was for a considerable time left in such an exposed state, that boys 
were able to entec, and wantonly to break down the wood-work of 
the interior ; and thus, ere it was observed, the pulpit itself, the 
memorial of our ancestors' piety, received more injury from their 
descendants' negligence, than did the edifice which contains it, 
from the disturbances and shocks of a religious revolution. Expe- 
rience has now taught us better to guard this fine rehc, mutilated 
as it is. 

Modern condition. — Of the more modern history of the parish, 
scarcely a fact worthy of commemoration has been preserved. Of 
its ancient loyalty, and more lately of its Protestantism, proof has 
been given ; both feelings appear to have kept ground. At the 
period of the Restoration, the minister of Tain was one of a noble 
band of four in the synod of Ross, who preferred suffering depo- 
sition and imprisonment to maintaining place with a polluted con- 
science. The example of the shepherd cannot have been lost upon 

annlvine the title to M'NeiU and his followers, who, we know, were actually pro- 
claimed rsftc/.. Besides, James before his accession to the Enghsh throne, had no 
sidijccUm Ireland; nor, if he had, is it conceivable how Ta.n should ha.x become 
the seat of their ravages.

the flock. And ever since the death or displacement of the last 
Episcopalian minister, the church here has been filled by a suc- 
cession of pious clergymen, whose names and characters are 
still held in the affectionate remembrance of many of the peo- 
ple ; the consequence of which has been a zealous attachment 
on their part to the Church of Scotland, and in no slight 
degree, perhaps, from the same cause a disinclination to revolu- 
tionary or republican sentiments. At the time of the Rebellion, 
we find they suffered a little from their loyalty. The burgh records 
inform us, that the inhabitants were greatly distressed by a large 
body of " the rebel army," so it is boldly worded at the very 
time, quartering for several weeks in the town, and exacting 
money and necessaries under all pretences ; and the town-council 
were forced, under pain of military extortion, at a day's warning, to 
muster L. 60 about half their gross revenue for the supply of 
their guests. 

As far as can be traced, there have never been many resident 
large proprietors in the parish, since much of the land belonged to 
the burgh itself, and much to gentlemen possessed of additional pro- 
perty in other parts of the country. Most of the land-owners, and 
in truth most of the people, bore the name of Ross : or, to speak 
more correctly, almost every body possessed two surnames, by 
one of which in general a patronymic beginning with Mac he 
was universally known in conversation, though he deemed himself 
called upon to change it to Ross, or sometimes to Munro, when- 
ever he acquired any status in society, or became able to write his 
name. Easter Ross, it may be observed, was of old divided between 
these two clans ; and their two chiefs are among the names of the 
jurors we have above quoted as present at the inquest in 1437  
From this circumstance of each individual's being furnished with 
two appellations, seems partly to have arisen the remark, which 
has found us way into Encyclopedias, that Tain is famous for nick- 
names ; but, partly, the remark was once true; for, when the by- 
names of those who had risen in society were forgotten, it became 
absolutely necessary to invent others, and those often of the odd- 
est description, to distinguish the multitudes of Rosses and Mun- 
roes. 

Modern Buildings. —The material now employed in every con- 
struction above that of a hut, is the fine white sandstone from the hill.

Scotland ; and is greatly set off by its fine large play-ground, which 
has been of lata tastefully planted, walled in, and railed. The new 
church is a substantial, but rather heavy-looking editice ; a tower 
is its great desideratum. There was erected in 1825, a handsome 
town and county house, close to the antique five- spired prison- 
tower, which forms the most prominent object in the town : unfor- 
tunately, it was not constructed fire-proof; and the upper rooms, 
being appropriated for the confinement of debtors, were, a few years 
ago, by some accident, inflamed. Several lives were lost, and the 
building was almost burnt to the ground. It has not since been re- 
built, and what was once an ornament, is now the greatest defor- 
mity in the place. 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1753 was 1870 
1811 2384 
1821 2861 

1831 . 3078 

1836 2915 ; males, 1299 ; females, 1616. 

The decrease during the last five years may be ascribed in part 
to the ravages of cholera in the village of Inver, where above a 
third of the inhabitants were swept off in a few weeks ; and partly 
to emigration ; while some diminution of trade is thought, besides, 
to have taken place in the town, in consequence of the non-resi- 
dence at present of many of the neighbouring proprietors, and per- 
haps, too, from the number of shops recently opened in the sur- 
rounding villages. However occasioned, it is certain that the value of 
houses in the town has, within the last few years, fallen nearly a half.

the parish ; the blind do not, it is believed, at present exceed 2 in 
number. 

Number of illegitimate births in the parish, during last three 
years, 15; but this includes several cases that were afterwards 
followed by marriage of the parties. 

Land-owners. — Besides the burgh itself, there are twelve land- 
owners possessing property above the yearly value of L. 50, viz. 
Hugh Rose Ross of Cromarty ; R. B. iEneas Macleod of Cad- 



TAIN.

boll ; Hon. Mrs Hay Mackenzie of Cromarty, patroness of the pa- 
rish; the Duchess Countess of Sutherland; Sir Charles Ross of Bal- 
nagown; George Mackenzie Ross of Aldie; Hugh Ross of Knock- 
breck; Fitzgerald Murray of Pitculzean; Daniel Ross of Hartfield; 
Donald Kennedy of Bogbain ; Malcolm Fraser of North Glastul- 
lich ; and George Ross of Moorfarm. Only the two last named 
are permanently resident. 

Languages. — The whole town and parish is at present nearly 
equally divided between the English and Gaelic languages. The 
latter is generally spoken in the country and in Inver village ; but 
the former, by the higher ranks in the country, and by almost every 
one in the town. Gaelic has of late rapidly lost ground ; in fact, it is 
rare to find a native of the town, under twenty or thirty years of age, 
able to speak it with ease; and it is never heard among the children 
on the streets. In the country, the change has not been quite so 
marked. The number of individuals able to speak Gaelic only, 
are, in town, 66 ; in country, 96; English only, in town, 100 ; in 
country, 36. If, however, we reckon those who are unable to 
speak or understand both languages with ease, each of these num- 
bers must be greatly increased. 

Character., 8fc. — .There is nothing very remarkable in the habits 
or character of the people. Their ancient spirit of loyalty has 
not quite died away, and a tendency to insubordination in any shape 
is seldom manifested ; while the general tone of feeling, we may 
add, is decidedly towards religion ; and though much of this is, 
doubtless, a habit of thinking transmitted from the generations 
gone by, yet much, it is believed, may be ascribed to the genuine 
workings of a living power, actuating individual minds, and through 
them leavening society in the mass.

Jgr [culture. — The number of acres in the parish, cultivated or 
uncultivated, has never been ascertained. A great proportion of 
the lands once belonged to the burgh ; most of them have been 
from time to time feued out at a rent of 6d. per acre ; and thus, 
within the last thirty or forty years, much additional ground has 
been brought into actual cultivation, and still more planted with 
thriving fir woods. All these lands were before considered by the in- 
habitants of the burgh as a common right, so that considerable re-' 
sistance was made to the first attempts of the magistrates thus to 
deprive them of their ancient privilege of pasture. For a consider- 
able time back, almost all the available burgh land has in this way 



294 



Ross AND CROMARTY. 



been parcelled out, to the extent of 4325 Scotch acres ; and ex- 
cept the Morrich Mor, which, as already mentioned, has been 
recently overblown with sand, together with the quarries and 
mosses of the hill district, there now remains little or none of 
the burgh property open to the people, thai is not too distant, 
or too barren to be made use of. The rent of arable land ave- 
rages about L. 1, 10s. per acre; in different districts, however, 
varying very considerably. The rate of farm-labour is about Is. 
a-day in winter, and Is. 6d. in summer ; the total expense of a 
farm-servant amounts to about L. 22 per year. The general dura- 
tion of leases is nineteen years ; only that the fields around the 
town, being in general cultivated by townsmen, and bringing 
a higher rent, are let annually, or at very short terms. Agri- 
culture has, of late years, rapidly advanced. The improved sys- 
tems have been almost universally adopted, and crops are raised, 
scarcely if at all surpassed in quality, in any district of Scotland. 
The cultivation of wheat, in particular, has made rapid strides- 
Twenty or even ten years ago, it was dealt in only by a very few of 
the larger farmers ; while now, there is scarcely a cottar who does 
not grow some. It has been found to answer well for the soil ; and, 
in accordance with this, has been the quickness of its reception. 
There have been many improvements of late on the various estates, 
chiefly in the way of reclaiming waste land, draining, fencing, 
planting, &amp;c. ; irrigation has been practised only in one large field 
belonging to Mr Ross of Cromarty, and in it in consequence, it 
is thought, of the over-purity of the water, the experiment has not 
been crowned with success. The same proprietor has contributed 
much to adorn the face of the country, by the tasteful manner in 
which he conducts his operations, so that beauty as well as profit 
may be the result. 

Quarries. — Those at present wrought are the common property 
of the burghers, being situated in the hill of Tain. The procuring 
of the finest white sandstone is attended witli no expense but that 
of quarrying it. 

Fisheries. — The village of Inver, situated at the eastern extre- 
mity of the parish, is the only fishing station, although the town is 
often supplied, besides, from'other quarters. Haddock and flounder 
are the staple kinds of fish ; cod, whiting, skate, are also found in 
abundance, as is herring in its season. Haddocks sell at the rate 
of one or two sometimes evien three or four for Id. according to 
the season of the yea No salmon-fishings are carried on. The 



TAIN. 



295 



proprietor of those farther up the frith purchases the burgh's right 
to those opposite the town, at an annual rent of L. 10. The mus- 
sel-scalp is a more profitable source of income, although the pro- 
per mode of management is by no means well understood. It is 
resorted to, yearly, by great numbers of fishermen from the coast 
of Morayshire, who pay to the burgh at the rate of L. 2 per boat 
for the liberty of removing a cargo of the fish. The revenue hence 
derived is rather unequal, but averages about L. 150. 

Manufactures. — The only manufactories, properly so called, in 
the parish, are an iron-foundry, in which the various descriptions 
of cast-iron ware used in the country round are produced ; and a 
brewery, which supplies the most of the neighbourhood with excel- 
lent ale. The burn of Morangie, beside which it is placed, has 
been remarked by strangers, for the economy of power shewn in the 
various uses to which it is applied. After irrigating the field above- 
mentioned, it is employed to give motion separately to a sawing, a 
carding, a grinding, and a dyeing-mill, besides affording water to 
the brewery ; and all within the space of a few hundred yards. 

Navigation. — There is no navigation carried on in the parish, 
except by ships hired for the purpose of carrying coal and lime, for 
the supply of the inhabitants ; by these, fir wood is frequently ex- 
ported to serve for coal-pit props. All other goods are for the 
most part shipped and landed at Cromarty or Invergorden, so that 
we are exposed to the disadvantage of a land carriage of eleven 
miles. 

V. — Parochial Economv. 
Burgh.— The burgh of Tain serves as a market-town, not only 
for this parish, but for the whole surrounding district, and for a con- 
siderable part of Sutherlandshire ; and to this it seems to owe its ex- 
istence and prosperity,— httle trade being carried on, save for the 
purposes of home consumption. Among the irregularly built 
towns of the north of Scotland, it used to be remarked for irregu- 
larity ; for every man seems to have placed his house, just as hap- 
pened to suit his private convenience. The same character still 
attaches to it, though in a less degree. The streets have been gra- 
dually straightened, and many of the more unsightly edifices pul- 
led down, though a principle of order is by no means even yet pre- 
dominant in the construction of new ones. The town is neither 
lighted, nor supphed with water ; for, though its gross revenue ave- 
rages L, 500, the other claims of expenditure in general exhaust 
the whole. 



296 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



There are no villages in the parish besides Inver, which con- 
tains merely a fishing population. 

Means of Communication. — The parish is well supplied in all 
directions with public roads, which together amount to twenty 
miles in extent- A mail coach passes daily from and to Inverness, 
and proceeds north to the Meikle Ferry; and a mail gig runs daily 
between Tain and Bonar. There has been established lately 
another daily coach to Inverness, which, in consequence of its les- 
sened fares and more convenient hours, has even already increas- 
ed the number of stage travellers, and which accordingly has every 
prospect of success. The bridges, of which there are a consider- 
able number, on account of the numerous streamlets, are general- 
ly kept in good repair ; and so, in general, are our stone fences ; 
there are now almost no hedges, so much has the Scottish taste, 
in this respect, prevailed beyond even what we perceive it to have 
done, of old. 

Ecclesiastical State. — From the charter of Charles II. it appears 
that Tain was formerly a collegiate charge, — though this would 
appear not to have continued beyond the times of Episcopacy. 
It is now, however, anxiously wished by many, that some such 
arrangement should again be brought about ; as the almost equal 
division into Gaelic and English hearers, each class demanding at- 
tention equal to what a single congregation would require, renders 
the field of ministration too arduous for any single clergyman. 
St Duthus' church, though now vacated, might, it is believed, at 
a moderate expense, be rendered a commodious place of worship 
for the Gaelic congregation. The new church was built in 1815, 
and is situated at the eastern extremity of the town, pretty near 
the centre of the parish. It was designed to accommodate 1200; 
and, though not constructed on the best acoustic principles, is, upon 
the whole, tolerably suitable. In St Duthus' church, all the sit- 
tings were free ; in this church none are free. The average rent is 3s. 
The manse, a handsome building, a short distance above the town 
was erected in 1824. The glebe attached s of the legal extent of 
.four acres, worth about L. 1, 10s. per acre yearly. The stipend 
is 18 chalders, half barley and half oatmeal, payable by the fiars 
prices of the county. There is always a catechist in the parish, 
who has L. 3, 10s. of salary from the session-funds with what gra- 
tuities he may receive from the families he visits. The late cate- 
chist who has died since this account has been commenced enjoyed 



TAIN. 297 

in addition, for the last few years of his Hfe, an annuity of L. 7, 10s. 
rom the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge. 

All the femilies in the parish, with the exception of 3 or 4, attend 
the Established Church. There may be, besides, 2 or 3 indivi- 
duals who attend a Secession chapel in a neighbouring parish. 

Religious and Charitable Jssociations.—There are no societies 
for religious purposes belonging exclusively to the parish, though it 
IS a chief seat of several. The Northern Missionary Society, which 
IS intended to embrace in its range the shires of Inverness, Ross, and 
Sutherland, was established in 18Q0, and meets annually at Tain, 
Inverness, and Dingwall, The late Rev. Dr Mackintosh of Tain 
who was, until his death in 1831, its valued secretary, and the late 
Rev. Alexander Fraser of Kirkhill, were the originators of the in- 
stitution. The annual subscription of 10s. 6d. is the condition of 
membership. The yearly contributions from the Tain district ave- 
rage from L. 70 to L. 80: .of which sum, probably more than L.30 
are from the parish itself. The Easter Ross Lad.es' Missionary 
and Bible Society, established in 1818, meets annually at Tain • 
Its collections average near L. 30; half the sum may be consider- 
ate, « -;.bution of this parish. The ladies usually devote 
about L. 6 of It to local objects, such as the education of the chil- 
dren of the poor. There is also a Society for the Relief of the 
Destitute Sick, established about seven years ago ; of which the 
annual subscriptions amount to about L. 12. In addition to all 
he above, and exclusive of the poor funds to be afterwards men- 
oned, the church collections for religious and charitable objects, 
may average L. 50. "ujeiLs, 

tiof tT'r'' parish is supplied with the means of educa- 
tion, to almost as great an extent as could be desired. Besides the 
parochia school, there is an academy, established in 1813 erect, 
ed and hberal y endowed by subscription; two female L and 
boarding schools, one supported by the burgh funds and fhLT 

childr n of both sexes; and a Gaelic Society school; in all eX'

writing and arithmetic, 3s. 6d. ; with book-keeping, 4s. ; and any 
of the above, with the addition of mensuration or the languages, 
7s. The school fees may amount to L. 25 or L. 28 per annum. 
At the academy, there is a rector who teaches arithmetic, geogra- 
phy, mathematics, and natural philosophy ; and, for the last pur- 
pose, he is provided with an excellent philosophical apparatus. 
There is also a teacher of the languages, namely, Latin, Greek, 
and French, and a teacher of English reading, grammar, and writ- 
ing. At the boarding-schools, the usual female accomplishments 
are taught. The Society school has been established chiefly for 
behoof of the village of Inver, which is wholly a Gaelic population, 
and which is, besides, at an impracticable distance from the town. 

The people are in general very anxious to secure for their chil- 
dren the best education their circumstances will permit. It has 
been remarked, that notwithstanding — or perhaps more correctly, 
ill consequence of- — the facility aff'orded by the academy for attain- 
ing what is usually termed a finished education, the number of boys 
from the parish who pursue their studies at the university is not 
increased, but rather diminished. The knowledge acquired here 
is generally deemed sufficient for those who do not intend to em- 
brace a profession demanding a college curriculum. It is not easy 
to tell how much of any improvement in the conduct of the people 
may be owing to the increased facilities of education ; that a higher 
tone of thinking has been communicated seems certain, and the 
degrading vices, such as drunkenness, appear, among the respect- 
able classes, to have much decreased. 

There is a library attached to the academy for the use of the 
pupils. More than one library, parochial and circulating, have 
from time to time been set on foot, but, from bad management, they 
have dwindled away. There is a public reading-room maintained, 
at which several newspapers are received. 

Friendly Societies, — Of these, there are three, namely, the Guild- 
ry Society, the Friendly Society, and the Mason Lodge. The 
first has existed since 1738, and is designed chiefly as a widow's 
fund ; the entry-money is L. 5, the quarterly subscription Is., and 
the annuity granted to the widow or to the children, until the 
youngest reach the age of twelve, L. 5. The second was es- 
tablished about twenty-five years ago, chiefly among the opera- 
tive classes. It assists the impoverished members in sickness and 
old age, and inters them at death. The Mason Lodge, which 
embraces only free-masons, has acted for above seventy years on a 
similar principle. 



TAIN. 299 



Poor Funds — The average number of persons receiving paro- 
chial aid, is about 145, among whom about L. 70 is annually di- 
'ided. In addition to this, the sum of L. 5 is yearly entrusted to 
the kirk-session fixjm the estate of Macleod of Cadboll for behoof 
of the poor; the interest of L. 300 is distributed by the executors 
of the late George Murray, Esq. of Westfield ; and a sum of 
L. 500 has been left by a Mr Robertson, that its interest may be 
yearly applied at Christmas for the relief of reduced householder.. 
Unfortunately, the reception of public charity is by very few con- 
sidered a humiliating circumstance, chiefly, perhaps, in conse- 
quence of a mumficent annual donation which used to be given 
by a benevolent gentleman of the name of Ross, residing in Lon- 
don, to be distributed among his poor namesakes. The result 
was an influx into the parish from every quarter of those not a 
tew who could lay any claim to the title of Ross. 

Prisons.~i:here is one prison in the parish, which serves for the 
whole surrounding district, and has of late been used for the greater 
partof Ross-shire. In 1836, the prisoners for poaching and breach of 
excise laws were 16; for theft, 7; for defrauding of creditors 1 
for assault, 9 ; for homicide, 2 ; in all, 35. Of'these, but 3 b 
long to the parish, viz. two for theft, and 1 for assault; and of these 
3, NOT ONE IS a native. We mention the circumstance particu 
iarly, as showing a moral character rarely to be met with in totons 
of an equal si.e. The walls of the prison are strong, yet it 1 a 
been broken through. The principal insecurity arises from'the wan 
of an nclosng wall. The management of the jail is not very good

The inns and alehouses in the town amount to 16 ; in the rest of 
the parish to 3. Here, as everywhere else, there have been com- 
plaints of the pernicious effects of the large number of these houses 
upon public morals ; and accordingly, they have been of late con- 
siderably restricted by the functionaries. 

Fuel. — That generally used, except by those persons in the 
parish who reside near the peat mosses, is English coal, at the 
rate of about Is. 8d. per barrel; the herring barrel is the mea- 
sure still employed. It is found cheaper than peat used alone, 
though of it, too, a large quantity is almost daily brought into the 
town, for sale, in small carts, chiefly from the neighbouring parish 
of Edderton, and is purchased to be used along with the staple 
fuel. A coal stoi-ehouse is at present in the course of erection. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In comparing the present state of the parish with that which 
existed at the time of the last Statistical Account, a very striking 
advance in almost every department may be perceived. The most 
important change, however, seems to be that of language. That 
from the peculiar situation of the Highlands of Scotland, the 
change is a necessary one, and that by it the avenues of knowledge 
are being opened up, and the power of doing good proportionally 
increased, may readily be allowed ; but no Highlander watching 
the process in its immediate effects can look on it without regret. 
The stream of traditionary wisdom descending from our forefathers 
has been interrupted in its flow ; the feelings and the sentiments 
of a race, distinguished for high feeling and noble sentiment, will not 
transfuse themselves into a foreign tongue ; and the link of connec- 
tion between the present and the past generations has been snapped. 
The prejudices and superstitions of the Highlander are indeed pe- 
rishing along with his better characteristics; but even this will not 
be contemplated with unmixed satisfaction, by those who believe 
that there are prejudices that elevate, more than they darken the 
mind. Before now, the Gael was debarred from fame, because he 
could speak only an uncultivated, though copious and nervous 
tongue ; now, he may chance as effectually to be debarred, because 
the fountain of Highland prejudice and Highland enthusiasm has 
been checked and rendered turbid at its source, and it may be long 
ere its inspiring waters renew their ancient flow. Still the change, 
we have said, is a necessary, and will in the end be a beneficial 
one ; and the sooner, therefore, it be accomplished now, perhaps 
the better.

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. CHARLES R. MATHISON, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 

Name — Boundaries — The original name of this parish signifies 
the grave, or the chapel of Mary. 

The parish Hes partly in the county of Ross, and partly in the 
county of Cromarty, owing to the circumstance of George, the 
tirst Earl of Cromarty, having possessed considerable property in 
it, and his having obtained the privilege of erecting his whole land - 
ed property in Scotland into a separate county, called the county 
of Cromarty. This property forms a part of many parishes in the 
synod of Ross ; and all these parishes are partly connected with 
the counties of Ross and Cromarty. 

Extent, Sfc. — This parish is about 10 miles in its greatest length, 
and 4 miles broad. It is bounded on the west, by the parish of 
Rosskeen ; on the east, by Loggie Easter ; on the north, by Ed- 
derton and Kincardine ; and on the south, by the sands of Nigg, 
and the Frith of Cromarty. The superficial contents of the parish 
may be estimated at 17,000 acres. 

Topographical Appearances.— The soil of the parish is various; 
but of late years, it has been greatly improved, especially in the 
lower parts, which border on the shore of the Frith of Cromarty. 
The whole of this range, including the Mains of New Tarbat, is 
now m a fine state of cultivation, and adorned with plantations. 
The higher grounds contain a great quantity of barren muir, in- 
termixed with natural wood, and fit only for the pasture of sheep. 
The soil IS, in general, of a light gravelly nature in those parts 
which are cultivated; but there is also a considerable quantity of 
inoss. The coast is flat, and composed of red sandstone. At 
the recess of the tide, the sea retires very far, and leaves an al- 
most uninterrupted passage to the opposite parish of Nigg. The 



302 



ROSS AND CROMAKTY. 



sands of Nigg contain a great quantity of cockles, and other shell- 
fish. The parish is in the lower parts very flat and level. The 
temperature of the atmosphere is in general mild and gentle, and 
extremely salubrious ; and the climate is free in a great measure 
from those heavy and noxious vapours which occasion almost inces- 
sant rains in many parts of the Highlands. In summer, there is 
a transparent sky, and unclouded sunshine. This is greatly ow- 
mg to the absence of any mountainous ridges. The hills which 
skirt the parish on the north are of no great elevation, and serve as 
a barrier of defence in that direction. There are no prevalent 
distempers peculiar to the district, though the parish is occasion- 
ally visited with fever. The inhabitants generally enjoy robust 
health, and often live to an extended old age. 

In winter, the sea coast is frequented by barnacles, and different 
species of wild duck. Swans occasionally visit the sands. There is 
abundance of sea-ware at certain seasons of the year, thrown a- 
shore, which the inhabitants collect as manure for their land. 
Westerly winds generally prevail, and blow very severely; but, for 
the last three years, east winds have been most prevalent. The 
whole of the lower district is well cultivated, and appears to reward 
the toil and expense employed in the production of the various 
agricultural crops ; and in summer, the aspect which it assumes is 
most beautiful. Directly opposite to the parish lies the Bay of 
Cromarty, which, together with the fine prospect afforded of the 
Moray Frith by the opening betwixt the Sutors, forms one of the 
most delightful landscapes in Britain. Much of the higher dis- 
trict of the parish still remains uncultivated, and covered with 
heather, amidst which large blocks of granite are thickly scat- 
tered, and great quantities of moss, which afford peats for fuel to 
the inhabitants. 

Hydrograpliy. — There is no river or fresh water lake in the 
parish. The small river of Balnagown bounds the parish on the 
north-east, and runs north and south until it empties itself in the 
Frith of Cromarty. On the south, the parish is bounded by the 
Frith of Cromarty, which is from 6 to 7 miles in breadth. In the 
vicinity of Tarbat House, in a beautiful plantation, and very near 
the shore, there are two chalybeate springs which flow perennially, 
and are strongly impregnated. 

Zoology. — The small river of Balnagown affords abundance of 
trout, and sometimes salmon of a certain growth. Cod, skate, 
flounders, and cuddies, and occasionally herring, arc fished in the 



KILMUIR EASTER. 303 

Frith of Cromarty. In the sands opposite the shore, there are 
considerable beds of cockles, and large mussel scalps, which are 
the source of some annual revenue to the principal proprietor in 
this parish, Mr Hay Mackenzie of Cromarty. There is also an 
oyster scalp, which thrives very well. 

Botany. — There are several superb and very ancient trees in 
the vicinity of Balnagown Castle, consisting of oak, and elm, and 
beech, and chestnut interspersed, and forming a splendid avenue. 
There is likewise, in the vicinity of Tarbat House a fine old grove, 
which contains trees of very ancient growth and large size. Larch 
is now frequently planted in the parish, but the Scotch fir is still 
the tree most commonly grown. 

n. — Civil History. 

Eminent Characters. — Long ere the controversies which have 
lately agitated our church and land were known, and while the 
people, especially in our rural districts, were distinguished by their 
devoted attachment to the clergy of the Establishment, flourished 
the excellent and amiable Mr Porteous. The Rev. John Porteous 
— a name which was never pronounced in Ross-shire without the 
deepest veneration — was minister of the parish of Kilmuir Easter 
for the long period extending between 1732 and 1775. His grand- 
father is said to have come to Inverness in Cromwell's army, and 
after the Restoration he settled in that ancient burgh, of which 
Mr Porteous, the minister of Kilmuir, was a native. During the 
period of his incumbency in this parish, extending to forty-three 
years, he officiated with the highest reputation, adorning his pro- 
fession with all those gifts and graces which serve to remind us of 
the'primitive purity and integrity of apostolic times. Nor did his 
Divine master fail to acknowledge him in his work of faith and la- 
bour of love, for he was favoured with many proofs of an accept- 
ed ministry while living ; and there is abundant reason to believe 
that he will have many as his joy and crown of rejoicing in the 
day of the Lord. 

The distinguishing characteristics of this venerable man, as a 
preacher of the Gospel and a teacher of righteousness, appear to 
have been, sublimity and spirituality of doctrine ; patriarchal sim- 
plicity of diction, and of manner ; a deep insight into the arcana of 
the human constitution, and the power of embodying his concep- 
tions m striking and forcible language, and of carrying irresistible 
demonstration to the conscience. He possessed a brilliant imagina- 
tion, which, though subject to occasional eccentricities, was still so 



304 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



thoroughly imbued with the solemnities of Christian truth, that it al- 
ways ministered instruction, and enabled him to enlighten and to edi- 
fy his hearers. He was " a man on earth devoted to the skies," and, 
from the fulness of a heart overflowing with love to God and to 
his fellow-creatures, he spoke with an unction and a pathos which 
carried captive the understanding and the affections to the obedi- 
ence of the truth. Though now dead upwards of sixty-three years, 
his memory is cherished with the highest veneration, and the re- 
spect and reverence with which his primitive pastoral admonitions, 
and profound doctrinal and experimental observations, have been 
handed down, resemble more the regard with which we may con- 
ceive the Jewish people to have listened to the predictions of their 
prophets, than the attention ordinarily paid to the instructions of 
uninspired men. Whilst minister of this parish, he was pre-emi- 
nently popular ; and the church of Kilmuir constituted a centre of 
attraction to a large surrounding neighbourhood, who hurried eager- 
ly from different and widely distant parishes to hear this man of 
God, and to hang upon his lips. He did the work of an evange- 
list, and made full proof of his ministry. « He watched and pray- 
ed—he wept and felt for all." His mortal remains are deposited 
in the church-yard of Kilmuir, and in the close vicinity of that spot 
in which he so long held forth the word of life, and cheered so of- 
ten the Christian pilgrim in his journey toward Zion. 

How sleep the good who sink to rest i 
By all tlieir country's wishes blest. 
When spring with dewy fingers cold, 
Returns to deck their hallow'd mould, 
She there shall dress a sweeter sod 
Than fancy's feet have ever trod. 
By angels' hands their knell is rung, 
By forms unseen their dirge is sung, 
There virtue comes, a pilgrim gray 
To bless the turf that wraps their clay, 
And piety shall still repair, 
To dwell a weeping hermit there. 

In the autumn of 1833, this parish was deprived of one of its 
most valuable members in the person of Donald Mitchell, who 
died at an advanced age, after having been for upwards of thirty 
years employed iu the office of catechist. Though an illiterate 
man, and not able to read even the Gaelic language until after 
his marriage, his views of divine truth were comprehensive, accu- 
rate, and profound, and for many years he was an able instructor 
to the young and rising generation. Diligent in duty, and clothed 
with the dignity and the moral force of Christian character, he had

try, in which he was familiarly known, as a solid, judicious, and 
deeply experienced disciple of the Lord Jesus. Never was there 
a more striking exemplification of the efficacy of Divine teaching, 
in enlightening the mind with that wisdom which cometh from 
ahove, and which often reveals to babes what is hid from the wise 
and the prudent. The inhabitants of this parish will long remem- 
ber the solemn warnings, the affectionate addresses, and the pa- 
thetic appeals of this man of God — and though dead, he yet 
speaketh. 

Heritors. — There are six land-owners. Mr Hay Mackenzie of 
Cromarty possesses the highest valuation, and is patron of the pa- 
rish. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of births commences in 1738, 
and there are no sessional records of an older date than 1771. 

Antiquities. — In addition to the antiquities so well described in 
the former Statistical Account of this parish, may be mentioned 
a round tower connected with the present church, and used as a 
belfry, which bears date in large figures, 1616, and which, after 
having braved the storms of two centuries, is still in a high state 
of preservation. 

There are still some remains of the ruins of the Castle of New 
Tarbat, once the seat of the Earls of Cromarty, which is said 
to have been the most elegant and highly finished house in the 
three counties. It stood near the site of the present mansion, and 
was allowed to fall into a state of dilapidation during the period of 
forfeiture. It is said to have been a most superb and spacious 
building, and beautifully adorned with turrets. 

On the estate of Kindace, there is a small wooded hillock, on 
the summit of which there was a Druidical circle until within 
the last few years, when the farmer of the place removed the 
stones to build a dike. There is a fine spring of clear water at the 
foot of the hillock ; and on the same property, there is a large cairn 
of stones, the tradition in regard to which is, that in a great battle 
fought there, a king was killed, and his head struck off, and bu- 
ried under this cairn. The hill is now called Kenrive, a corrup- 
tion from the Gaelic of Ceann Righ, or King's-head ; and the 
foundation of a large castle or building can yet be traced close to 
the cairn. 

Modern Buildings.— Balnagown Castle is a beautiful building, 
and splendidly situated. It is partly ancient, and partly modern. 
It boasts a very high antiquity, and was one of the seats of the

llOSS AND CROMAllTY. 



Earl of Ross during the prevalence of the feudal system. Within 
the last two years, an elegant and handsome addition has been 
made to it. There is a spacious lawn in front of the castle, taste- 
fully laid out, and adorned with a variety of trees. Altogether, it 
is one of the most delightful residences in the north of Scotland, 
enjoying a commanding prospect of the finest scenery in the sur- 
rounding country. Within a short distance of Balnagown, and 
near the shore, stands Tarbat House, a highly finished modern 
building, and the chief seat of Mr H. Mackenzie of Cromarty. 
The grounds surrounding it are laid out with great taste, and have 
of late years been highly improved. Kindace House is a coip- 
modious mansion, and very pleasantly situated in the upper part of 
the parish. The house of Milmount is a beautiful residence.

1831 . . 1556 

It will be observed, that the population of this parish has de- 
creased since 1795, that is, in thirty-six years, by 419. This is 
partly owing to emigration, but principally to the system of large 
farm-letting, which has of late years become so general. The 
number of the population residing in villages may be estimated at 
456; the remaining 1100 reside in the country.

Number of families in the parish, _ . . _ . 373

There are three proprietors who generally reside in the parish ; 
Mr Hay Mackenzie of Cromarty, Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, 
and Captain Robertson of Kindace. All the land-owners, of whom 
there are six, possess a yearly rental much greater than L. 50 
Sterling. The language generally spoken by the people is English, 
though there are not a few of the aged who are unable to speak it. 
The Gaelic language has very perceptibly lost ground within the 
last forty years, owing to the desire which is now very prevalent 
among parents of the lower classes to have their children taught 
to read and understand English ; and it would be difficult to meet 
with many of the labouring people who cannot speak English with 
tolerable facility. The English language is daily taught in the 
Society School in the upper district of the parish, and this affords 



KILMUIR EASTER. 



307 



an opportunity of acquiring it to the poorest of the people. Along 
with the improved education of the lower classes, arising from 
their general acquaintance with the English language, there is a 
growing improvement likewise in their customs and habits. Those 
popular amusements which formerly engrosed much of their time, 
and dissipated their means and attention, and were the inlets to 
much low debauchery, are almost entirely given up, and when 
resorted to, occasionally, are not at all so keenly prosecuted as 
they used to be, in former generations. The habits of the people 
are cleanly and respectable. The ordinary food of the. peasantry 
consists of potatoes and meal, with fish and milk occasionally ; and 
in general, they are sober, steady, moral, and disposed to pay a de- 
corous attention and respect to the observances and ordinances of 
religion. Poaching in game is a crime almost unknown, and smug- 
gling seems to have been entirely given up for several years. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Arable land, about - 2,500 acres. 

Natural wood and plantations, 4,500 
Moor, meadow, and pasture, 10,000 

17,000 

Agriculture is well understood, and practised upon the most 
approved and scientific principles. Many of the farmers in 
the parish are connected with the Ross-shire Farming Socie- 
ty for the Improvement of Corn, and of the different Breeds of 
Cattle. The usual five-shift course is adopted : green crop, 
barley or wheat, two years grass, and oats, or beans, or pease. 
Proprietors appear anxious to improve their land, and lime and 
bone manure are generally employed. 

Rent. — Arable land averages from L. 1 to L. 1, 10s. per acre. 
The rent of grazing per ox or cow varies from L. 2 to L. 2, 10s. 
per annum. 

Wages. — The rate of wages for farm-labourers is generally Is. 
per day without victuals; women 6d. per day. Masons and car- 
penters get from Is. 6d. to 2s. per day. Farm-servants who reside ' 
with farmers have an income, including all they receive, of from 
L. 18 to L. 20 per annum, besides a house. 

The Cheviot and black-faced and Leicester sheep are common 
m the parish, and the polled Aberdeen black-cattle are in the 
course of being introduced on several farms. It is thought by com- 
petent judges, that, by a proper application of capital, a consi- 



ROSS AND CROMAiny. 

lerable quantity of waste land might be advantageously reclaimed. 
Kents are considered as generally high, and the ui-ual duration of 
leases is for nineteen years. Farm-buildings and enclosures are, 
upon the whole, in a good state of repair. 

Produce.— The following is an account of the amount and value 
of the raw produce of the parish, so far as they have been ascer- 
tained. 

Oats, 2000 qrs. at L. , 5s. per quarter, . L. 2500 0 0

Total amount, L. 9221 0 0 

Live- Stock— Horses of all sizes, .300 ; black-cattle, of all ages, 
and different kinds, 1000, more or less ; sheep of all kinds, 2000 • 
swine, 300 ; goats, 30. 

There is no land in the parish in a state of undivided common. 
A considerable quantity of butter and cheese is annually made and 
sold, of which it would be difficult to estimate the exact amount and 
value. There are, in all, fourteen farms in the parish, besides a 
number of small holdings, averaging each from 2 to 10 or 12 acres. 
These small holdings are in detached spots, and in general on the 
outskirts of the larger farms. 

Qiiarries. — There is a quarry of fine white freestone at Kinrive, 
on the property of Kindace, resembling the Craigleith stone, ca- 
pable of a high polish, and very durable. There are likewise se- 
veral quarries of red stone, but much inferior in value to that of 
Kinrive. The quarry of Kinrive extends in a continued ridge to 
Camscurrie, to the north of Tain, a distance of ten or twelve miles. 
 Fisheries. — There is no regular fishery of any kind in the pa- 
rish, though there is a village Portlich, the inhabitants of which 
were once almost all fishers. The descendants of these people 
have, in general, betaken themselves to trades, and probably find- 
ing a more certain livelihood by these means, have almost'entirely 
abandoned fishing, though there are occasionally some boats which 
go from this village to the herring fishing. 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 
Villages. — There is a village in the parish, Milntown, in which 
there are four markets held annually. The population of this vil- 



KILMUIR EASTER.

lage amounts to 200. There are other two villages, Bartaraville 
and Portlich. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office at Miln- 
town, and the great county road runs through this village ; 
by which the royal mail-coach travels daily north and south, 
and another coach for the accommodation of passengers, dur- 
ing the summer and harvest months, from Inverness to Tain. 
The roads are excellent. A new road has been lately constructed 
through the most high land part of the parish, which will prove a 
great convenience to the people. There are several other new 
roads in progress, so that the whole parish will soon be intersected 
with excellent means of conveyance. There are two bridges, one 
over the river of Balnagown, and the other at Polio. They are 
both in good condition. There is a harbour at Balintraid, which 
affords accommodation for vessels from Leith and Aberdeen and 
other ports ; and which is very convenient for the people of this, 
and of neighbouring parishes, by the facility with which it enables 
them to procure coal, and various articles of merchandise. A 
considerable quantity of grain from the district of Easter Ross, 
and large quantities of fir wood for the coal-pits and railroads in 
the south, are likewise annually exported from Balintraid pier. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The present church was built in 1798, 
and contains 900 sittings. It is situated in the south-east end of 
the parish, and is distant about five miles from some of the inha- 
bitants. There are from twenty to thirty free-sittings in it. It is at 
present in a good state of repair. The manse was built about 100 
years ago, since which time additions have been made to it, and 
it has been frequently repaired. There are 6 acres of glebe, 
valued at L. 12 per annum. The stipend is 87 bolls, 1 firlot, 1 peck, 
Oji lippies oatmeal, 9 stones, Ross-shire boll, and 68 bolls, 1 firlot, 
1 peck, If lippybarley, 9 stones, Ross-shire boll, and L. 62, Os. 

Sterling. The stipend awarded by the Court of Teinds was 
15 chalders; but the teinds do not pay the stipend, nor the sum 
for communion elements. 

There is no chapel of ease or Dissenting chapel in the parish, 
the people being, with the exception of one or two individuals, all 
members of the Established Church, which, in this parish is well 
attended, and in general crowded. There is a catechist appointed 
by the minister, with the consent of the congregation, and paid by 
the people and minister. There are individuals from 350 families, 
amounting to 800, who regularly attend the parish church. The

ave age number of communicants may be stated at 60. The pro- 
bable average amount of church collections yearly for re 'I" 
objects may be estimated at L. 20. There I a Bib S tietv

jc«eon. There are two schools, the parochial, and one sun 
ported by the Society for Propagating Christian Kn;wledge. The" 
pansh schoolnjaster has the legal accommodation, and a falary of

yearly The salary of the Society teacher is L. 18, with a house 
bu.lt by the parishioners. His school fees may amount to L. 6 
annually. The numbers who attend both schools durinff the veir 
may amount to 160 children. The expense of education, and'the 
blanches of instruction taught at the parochial school, are as fol- 
lows : reading per quarter, 2s.; reading, writing, and arithmetic, 
2s 6d. ; Latm and Greek, 5s. ; book-keeping, 7s. 6d. ; and Eng- 
lish grammar, 3s. In the Society school, English reading, writ 
ing, and arithmetic are regularly taught. The people generally 
are able to read, and appear to .appreciate the benefits of educa- 
tion. There is no additional school necessary in this parish 

Literature.— There is no parochial library, but many of the 
more respectable inhabitants are connected with a district library 
which affords many valuable works. And it would be difficult to 
find a rural parish in the north of Scotland, of the same dimen- 
sions, which contains a greater number of intelligent and well in- 
formed individuals, in the various classes of society. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— There are from 80 to 100 who 
regularly receive parochial aid. Their funds are derived from 
the following sources : mortcloth per annum, L. 2; rent of house 
m Tain belonging to the poor, which averages L. 15 annually; 
collections in church, which amount to L. 22 yearly, making in all 
L. 39. There is likewise a mortification of barley by George, 
Earl of Cromarty, which produces 5 bolls annually, for distribu- 
tion among the poor ; and there are other mortifications, amount- 
mg to L. 1, 3s. lOid. yearly. There is no other mode adopted 
for procuring funds for the poor. An assessment has never been re- 
sorted to. The annual sums distributed to each pauper may ave- 
rage 5.S. or 6s. in the year. None but the extremely necessitous 
receive parochial aid, and others are dissuaded from scekino- it.

and taught to consider it as degrading. Some who receive occa- 
sional assistance are not enrolled in the list of paupers. 

Inns. — There are 2 inns, and 4 public-houses. Intemperance 
is not, however, a prevalent vice in the parish, and it is very rare- 
ly that the people are known to quarrel or fight. 

Fuel. — Coals are generally used in the lower, and peats in the 
higher, district of the parish. Coals generally sell for Is. Id. im- 
perial barrel, and peats for Is. the cart. The coals come from 
Newcastle, and there is abundance of moss in the parish. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Isif, When the last Statistical Account of this parish was written, 
the real rent did not much exceed L.1400 Sterling; nowitisL. 3800 
Sterling. The manufacture of kelp and shell-lime have been al- 
together discontinued, and lime and bone manure are generally in 
use. Within the last eighteen months, a toll-bar has been erect- 
ed at the bridge of Polio. Instead of there being upwards of 30 
tippling -houses in the parish, there are now only 2 inns, and four 
public-houses. All the agricultural implements now used are of 
the most approved kind, and oxen are never employed in plough- 
ing. Wheat is generally grown on all the farms in the parish, 
and is found to afford a good remunerating price. The roads 
which intersect the parish, are kept in good condition. In the up- 
per district, and especially in the environs of Kindace, great im- 
provements have been effected of late years. There are now four 
pubhc roads in the parish, running parallel to each other, includ- 
ing the new road lately constructed along the upper district, and 
reaching from Tain to the policy of Novar, in the parish of Alness. 
The harbour of Balintraid, in the south-west end of the parish, 
has likewise been erected since the last Statistical Account was 
published. 

2d, With respect to the improvements of which the pa- 
rish is susceptible. It has been already observed, that the 
system of husbandry pursued is of the most approved kind, and 
that the means of internal conveyance are excellent. Much, 
however, remains to be done, in this, as in most other pa- 
rishes, to advance the inhabitants to the maximum state of com- 
fort and happiness. We have no desire to advocate any Utopian 
theory on this most important subject, but merely to suggest some 
hints for those substantial and sober improvements which might 
meliorate the condition of the people. If any thing could be 
-done to give employment to the numerous and increasing set- 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

tiers in villages-whether by establishing some branch of manu- 
lacture, or by urging and encouraging able-bodied men to fish re- 
gularly m the Frith of Cromarty, or by allocating certain small por- 
tions of ground to stances for houses, as an inducement to build and 
to permanent residence in the parish ; these expedients, or any one of 
them, if vigorously prosecuted, might increase indefinitely the com- 
tort and happiness of the lower classes. The great evil which re- 
quires to be remedied in some way or other, is the fluctuating state 
ot the population, in consequence of the arable land being in the 
possession of a few,— which, however much it may tend to the agricu 1- 
tural improvement of the parish, certainly is not calculated to improve 
the state of the population. In consequence of this, many of the 
people are always on the wing, and shifting from one parish to an- 
other, in quest of a better place or of more congenial employment; 
thus rendering in a great measure nugatory the instruction which 
they receive, whether in the way of catechizing, or of private pas- 
toral admonition and reproof. 

It is expected that a saving's bank will be soon established in 
this district with a government security, and the sooner this is set 
agoing the better. 

We may observe, as an instructive fact in the philosophy of 
education, that the greatly more intelligent character of the people 
of this parish now, than it was forty years ago, is owing in no small 
degree to their having been taught to read Gaelic as well as 
English, in the school established by the Society. It was this 
which first excited a desire for more information, and roused with- 
in them the latent principal of curiosity, proving that the only ef- 
fectual way to instruct the ignorant is to address them first in the 
language which is most familiar to them, whether our object be 
to win their attention, or to engage their affections. 

If a village or parochial library were established by voluntary 
contributions, consisting of interesting and instructive books in 
Gaelic and English, to which the poor might have free access, it 
might prove an incalculable benefit to many. It would be the 
means of creating a relish for reading, and for intellectual enjoy- 
ment among those who are still destitute of it, and of filling up 
the void of idle hours with profitable and amusing pastime.

PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. THOMAS MUNRO, MINISTER. 



I- — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Kiltearn derives its name from two Gaelic words, 
Kiell Tiffhearn, the burying-place of the laird, though the particu- 
lar circumstance which gave rise to the name is unknown ; for the 
principal family in the district, the Munroes of Fowlis, had their 
burying-place at Chanonry, until the year 1588, 

Extent, Boundaries. — The parish is situated about the middle 
of the county, on the north shore of the Cromarty Frith. Its 
breadth along the shore, from Novar Burn to the rivulet of Altna- 
lait, near Tulloch, is about 6 miles, but, as it extends for about 20 
miles into the hills, its breadth becomes considerably varied. It is 
bounded by Alness on the east ; by Contin and Lochbroom on the 
north ; by Dingwall and Fodderty on the west ; and the Cromarty 
Frith, as already mentioned, forms the southern boundary. 

Topographical Appearances. — The whole of the parish, with the 
exception of a part, varying in breadth from one to two miles along 
the shore, consists of one mass of hills covered with heath, or in 
some places planted with firs. Among these are some of conside- 
rable elevation, particularly Wyvis, which rises to the height of 
3720 feet above the level of the sea. This hill is never without 
some snow even in the hottest summer, and the forest of Wyvis is 
held of the King on the singular condition of paying a snowball 
any day of the year, if required. In the valleys between these hills 
there is a great deal of heath and coarse grass, which at one time 
maintained numbers of cattle from the small farms on the low 
grounds. In one or two of these hollows, too, the mountain streams 
have formed small lakes, which diversify the scenery, and afford ex- 
cellent sport to the angler. 

Hydrography.— The principal of these lakes is Loch Glass, at 
the distance of six miles from the sea, about five miles in length, 
and one in breadth. Its depth has not been ascertained; but 

KOSS and CROMARTY. X

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



from the circumstance that it is seldom known to be covered with 
ice, It must be considerable. Near the south end of it is a small 
island, where the lairds of Fowlis had at one time a summer house. 
The waters of this loch are discharged into the sea by the Ault- 
graad, a stream which, in its course, presents the most singular 
natural curiosity in the north of Scotland. Shortly after quitting 
the loch, it forms ' a succession of very picturesque falls, and, af- 
ter winding for some distance in a valley, enters a deep and nar- 
row chasm in the red sandstone rock, and flows through it for two 
miles. Its course is thus graphically described by the late Dr Ro- 
bertson in the old Statistical Account : " The river continues to 
run with rapidity for about three-quarters of a mile, when it is con- 
fined by a sudden jutting out of the rock. Here, the side view 
from the summit is very striking. The course of the stream being 
thus impeded it whirls and foams, and beats with violence againsl 
the opposing rock, till, collecting strength, it shoots up perpendi- 
cularly with great fury, and forcing its way, darts with the swiftness 
of an arrow through the winding passage on the other side. After 
passing this obstruction, it becomes in many places invisible, owino- 
partly to the increasing depth and narrowness of the chasm, and 
partly to the view being intercepted by the numerous branches of 
trees which grow on each side of the precipice. About a quarter 
of a mile further down, the country people have thrown a shght 
bridge, composed of trunks of trees covered with turf, over the 
rock, where the chasm is about 16 feet wide. Here the observer, 
if he has intrepidity enough to venture himself on such a totter- 
ing support, and can look down on the gulf below without any un- 
easy sensations, will be gratified with a view equally awful and as- 
tonishing. The wildness of the steep and rugged rocks; the gloomy 
horror of the cliff's and caverns, inaccessible to mortal tread, and 
where the genial rays of the sun never yet penetrated ; the water- 
falls, which are heard pouring down in different places of the pre- 
cipice, with sounds various in proportion to their distance ; the 
hoarse and hollow murmuring of the river, which runs at the depth 
of near 130 feet below the surface of the earth, cannot be contem- 
plated without exciting emotions of wonder and admiration in the 
mind of every beholder." From the appearance of the opposite 
sides of this remarkable chasm it seems quite clear that the rock 
must, at some early period, have been rent asunder by volcanic 
agency. Anterior to this period, the hollow above the point where 

 There is at present a ubsfantial wooden one. 



KILTEAllN.

the river enters the rock must have been filled with water, for in 
some places the height at which the water stood is still quite dis- 
tinguishable. 

The only other stream in the parish worth mentioning is the 
Skiack, which is formed by the union of several mountain streams, 
and falls into the sea near the church, about half a mile from the 
mouth of the Aultgraad. In summer, particularly if the season be 
dry, these streams are so small that they can scarcely struggle 
among the stones to reach the shore ; but after heavy rain or the 
melting of the snow in the hills, they swell into impetuous torrents, 
and require to be prevented, by embankments, from injuring the 
cultivated spots on their banks. 

The Cromarty Frith, on the south side of the parish, lies on a 
bed of sandstone covered over with sand and the detritus of the 
different rivers which flow into it. The slime thus deposited covers 
the sand, in many places, to the depth of several inches. The 
water contains httle salt, and the time of high and low water is a 
quarter of an hour later than at Cromarty. 

In the heights of the parish, there are several extensive tracts 
of moss, where the inhabitants cut peats in summer to serve for 
winter fuel. In cutting out these, numbers of fir-trees are dug 
up, which, owing to the antiseptic qualities of the moss water, are 
perfectly sound, and remain so for a very long time when used 
for building. They are also very commonly used by those who 
live near the mosses for light. When split up into small pieces 
and carefully dried, they burn with much clearness, and add greatly 
to the comfort of the poor during the long winter nights. Clay 
and shell marl are found in trifling quantities ; but have not been 
applied in any considerable quantity to the purposes of agriculture. 

Mineralogij.—Theve are indications of the existence of coal indif- 
ferent parts of the parish,- and some attempts were actually made 
many years ago under the direction of the late Sir Harry Munro, to 
discover the most proper situations for Wbrliing a mine, but were un- 
fortunately abandoned. The reason alleged was, that though coal 
was found, it lay so deep, that, unless the bed was considerable, it 
would not pay the expense of working. In a rock on the banks 
of Aultnancaorach, a rivulet that falls into the Altgraad, some 
ore was discovered, which, when smelted, was found to produce 
good lead. The prevalence of chalybeate springs in different 
quarters clearly indicates the existence of iron, though the quan- 
tity is unknown. Some of these were frequented at one time for 
their medicinal virtues.

Climate, &amp;c. — The climate of a district is of course greatly influ- 
enced by its situation and exposure ; and, in a parish like Kiltearn, 
where all varieties exist, from the maritime low grounds to heights 
some thousand feet above the level of the sea, great differences are 
found to exist. During the prevalence of the southerly and westerly 
winds from the Atlantic, the weather, though often rainy, is not 
so cold as when they blow from the east and north-east over the 
frozen countries in the north of Europe. The air on the higher 
grounds is often cold and moist ; but the cultivated district that 
rises gradually from the sea to the hills, enjoys a climate second 
to none in Scotland. A favourable testimony to the healthfulness 
of the climate is afforded by the many instances of longevity which 
have occurred. Persons have been known to attain to the great 
age of 100, 107, and even 117 years. Several live to 80, and 70 
is by no means an uncommon age. The prevalent disorders are 
colds, coughs, influenza, and rheumatism, and these are more 
severe during easterly winds.  

Zoology.— Theve are no rare species of animals in the parish, but 
such as are common throughout the country. Wolves existed in 
former times ; foxes were numerous till lately, and a few are yet 
occasionally seen. Badgers and Polecats are found, though in very 
inconsiderable numbers. Some rabbits were introduced a few 
years ago, and they have since that time multiplied so amazingly 
as to have become a serious annoyance. The hills abound with 
deer and all kinds of moor game, and on Wyvis are found ptar- 
migans and mountain hares. 

Various kinds of shell-fish are found on the shore, as mussels, 
cockles, and welks. There are also some banks where, in the pro- 
per season, and at a certain state of the tide, good oysters may be 
gathered. The salmon tribe enter the streams about the end of 
June, and in the beginning of October ascend for the purpose of 
depositing their spawn. The fry descend to the sea with the floods 
in January and February, and reascend in autumn as salmon trout 
and grilses. In the lochs and streams are found several varieties 
of trouts, in considerable numbers.

 The gradual deterioration of the climate for many years is a subject of universal 
remark. Some seem disposed to regard this as an idle fancy, but it is apprehended 
without any just grounds. It is an undoubted fact, that several years ago, the crops 
were secured much earlier tlian at present ; this is the more remarkable, as the 
system of management was then very defective, and many varieties of early seed 
have been since intioduccd

Malcolm II. feued out the lands of the country to those fami- 
lies who had assisted him in extirpating the Danes, the coun- 
try between the burgh of Dingwall and the water of Alness 
was assigned to Donald Munro, and from that circumstance re- 
ceived the name of Ferindunuil, or Donald's land. Part of 
these lands was afterwards erected into a barony, called the Ba- 
rony of Fowlis. From Donald Munro is lineally descended 
the present Sir Hugh Munro, Bart., who is the twenty-ninth 
baron of Fowlis, and proprietor of about two-thirds of the lands of 
the parish. This family has, at diflFerent times, produced indivi- 
duals whose military talents reflect the highest honour on their 
country and name. In comparatively later times, many of them dis- 
tinguished themselves by their firm adherence to the principles of 
the Reformation, and their devoted attachment to the House of 
Hanover. Buchanan mentions, that, among those who assembled 
at Inverness to assist the unfortunate Queen Mary, were the Frasers 
and Munros, " who were esteemed among the most valiant of the 
clans inhabiting those countries." In the war carried on by Gus- 
tavus Adolphus against Ferdinand II. there were so many of the 
name of Munro, that, among the officers of that name who served in 
that war, there were 3 generals, 8 colonels, 5 Heutenant-colonels, 1 1 
majors, and above 30 captains, besides a great number of subalterns. 
Sir Robert Munro, the grandfather of the present Baronet, was a 
man who would have done honour to any age or country ; beino- 
distinguished alike for the highest military talents and the most 
unaffected piety. When still a very young man, he served for 
several years in Flanders under the Duke of Marlborough,' and 
there formed an intimacy with the celebrated Colonel James 
Gardiner. His father, also called Sir Robert, was still living 
at the breaking out of the Rebellion in 1715; and, though 
quite blind, actively exerted himself to support the Royal cause 
in the north. The Earl of Seaforth sent him word, that " he 
was now designed to execute what he had long determined to 
set King James on the throne," and at the same time demanded 
his arms. Sir Robert returned answer, that « what arms he had 
were for the use and service of King George, whom he would de- 
fend while his blood was warm." Retaining a sufficient number 
to guard his own residence, he sent the rest of his people to unite 
with a body of the Sutherland Royalists at Alness bridge, where 
the whole encamped under the command of his son. They de 
tained the rebels in the north, under Seaforth, from joining the main

army of the insurgents at Perth for two months ; and, as Mar was 
atraid to cross the Frith without this reinforcement, time was given 
tor the adoption of those measures which afterwards frustrated 
that unfortunate attempt. ' Sir Robert served his country in vari- 
ous capacities for many years, and for thirty of them was a member 
of the British ParUament. In 1740, he passed over a second time 
into Flanders; and at the battle of Fontenoy, fully supported the 
character which he and his men had formerly acquired. The 
Elector Palatine, through his envoy at the British Court, tendered 
his thanks to the King for the excellent conduct of this regiment, 
" which," says he, " was owing to the care of Sir Robert Munro, 
their lieutenant-colonel ; for whose sake," he adds, " he should 
always pay a regard to a Scotsman for the future." But it would 
be impossible to do any thing like justice to the character of this 
great man in a short sketch like the present. He ended his life 
at the battle of Falkirk. He had been shortly before promoted to 
the command of a regiment, which, unlike his brave Highlanders 
at Fontenoy, deserted him in the moment of attack, and left him 
enclosed by the enemy. From a letter of his son. Sir Harry, to 
President Forbes, it appears that he, for a while, fought single- 
handed with half-a-dozen of their number, and slew two or three, 
until one of them, seeing no prospect of overcoming the grey- 
headed hero by fair and open means, discharged a pistol-shot into 
his groin, and thus ended the life of a hero and a Christian. It 
is much to be regretted that no one duly qualified, has been found 
to undertake the biography of this eminent man ; for it may be 
safely affirmed, that few ever led a more useful life, or transmitted 
a more unsuUied name to posterity, than the late Sir Robert 
Munro. His son, Sir Harry, was an excellent classical scholar, 
and at his death left ready for publication a large critical work on 
Buchanan's Psalms, which met with the highest approbation from 
the celebrated Ruddiman. Having gone to Edinburgh for the 
recovery of his health, he died in 1781. 

At the west end of the church, is buried the late Sir Hector 
Munro, of Novar, K. B., who, after spending much of his life in 
active military service, and acquiring the highest distinction as a 
brave and intrepid soldier in various parts of the world, passed the 

 " An old companion in arms, one day, when describing the closing scene in the 
life of his almost idolized chief, after pouring out his curse on the dastards who had

evening of his days in improving his estates and ameliorating the 
condition of his tenantry. 

Parochial Ministers. — Besides the Fowlis family, there have been 
several individuals, of considerable eminence in various departments, 
connected with the parish. One Donald Munro, minister of Kil- 
tearn, and contemporary with Buchanan, furnished that historian 
with much information respecting the Highlands and isles, of which 
he was archdeacon, and is characterised by him as a pious and learn- 
ed man. The ministers of the parish, as far back as is known, were 
Messrs T. Hogg, J. Gordon, Hugh Campbell, William Stuart, 
Andrew Robertson, George Watson, Harry Robertson, D.D. The 
present minister is Mr Thomas Munro. Mr Hogg was settled in 
the parish in 1655, but was obliged to leave it at the Restoration to 
make way for an Episcopal minister. He was one of five mini- 
sters in the synod who refused to conform, and was consequently 
subjected to a harassing persecution. After a tedious imprison- 
ment in the Bass, he at length obtained his liberty, and retired to 
• Holland, where his learning and piety acquired for him the greatest 
esteem. He appears to have united the most sincere and" ardent 
piety to a strength of mind which no prospect of suffering could 
daunt. At a period when, to all appearance, his affairs were despe- 
rate, when he was obliged to fly from his parish and people with- 
out any prospect of ever seeing them, he declared, with the most 
assured confidence, that there should be such a revolution as hap- 
pened afterwards, and that he should return to his charge at Kil- 
team. And so it was. In consideration of his eminent worth, and 
as a sort of reparation for his sufferings, King William appointed 
him one of his chaplains for Scotland. He did not, however, live 
long to enjoy his honours and ease ; for, exhausted by a long course 
of fatigue and suffering, he died in 1692. At the entry to the south- 
west door of the church, his grave is marked by a plain stone, which 
bears the following singular inscription : " This stone will witness 
against the people of Kiltearn, if ever they bring in an unffodlv mi- 
nister here."  

No historical events of any importance have, of late years, hap- 
pened in the parish. The feuds which used at one time to cause 
so much bloodshed, are now happily unknown ; and till very lately, 
the communication with the south was so imperfect, that the events

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

xvhich agitated the other parts of the kingdom, had always become 
matters of history, before the natives of the north had received any 
uitelhgence respecting thern. It is only when events immediately 
attect a people's own interests that they fairly excite them ; but 
even m a case of this kind, the inhabitants of a rural district are so 
scattered, that any temporary excitement soon passes away from 
want of the assurance and confidence inspired by numbers and 
union. Towards the end of last century, when sheep began to be 
generally introduced into the north, and numbers of the tenantry 
were ejected to make way for them, the minds of the people were 
so excited by witnessing such frequent instances of what they con- 
ceived to be wanton oppression and cruelty, that numbers of them 
assembled, and collecting together all the sheep in Sutherland and 
the north-eastern parts of Ross-shire, drove them in one mass as far 
as Kiltearn, when they were dispersed by a party of the 42d Regi- 
ment, then stationed at Fort George, under the command of Co- 
lonel Sir Hector Munro. Several of the rioters were apprehend- 
ed and tried at Inverness ; two of them were sentenced to transport- 
ation, but afterwards escaped from jail. 

Land-owners.— The land-owners of the parish are five in num- 
ber; Sir Hugh Munro of Fowlis ; H. A. J. Munro of Novar ; Cap- 
tain E. B. Fraser of Balcony ; Simon Mackenzie of Mountgerald; 
and Duncan Davidson of Tulloch ; all of them, except Captain 
Fraser, non-resident in the parish. Two of them, Novar and Tul- 
loch, though proprietors in this parish, have their residences in the 
neighbouring ones. It is much to be regretted, indeed, that absen- 
teeism is become so very common throughout the whole country. 

Mansions once 

Knew their own masters. 

Now the legitimate and rightful lord 

Is but a transient guest j 

and in too many cases, not even that. The people are remarkably 
sensible to any kindness shewn them, particularly by a countryman; 
and the presence of a landlord, by furnishing a stimulus to good 
conduct and honourable exertions, could not fail to be productive 
of the most beneficial results. 

Antiquities. — In all quarters of the parish were found, at one 
time, numbers of cairns or heaps of stones, usually covering a grave 
rudely formed of large flat stones. It has been conjectured that 
the object in collecting these heaps, was to protect the dead bo- 
dies from wolves, bears, and other ravenous animals which formerly 



KILTEARN. 



321 



infested the country. But this can scarcely be admitted for a 
probable explanation ; for in that case, these cairns would neces- 
sarily be much more numerous than they are, or several bodies 
would be deposited in each. This, however, is not found to be 
the case. There is reason indeed to believe that many of them 
owe their origin to a very different cause. The original cultiva- 
tors of the soil, being ignorant of any better mode of getting rid 
of the stones which impeded their agricultural operations, collected 
them into those heaps, which have since furnished matter for so 
much valuable antiquarian disquisition. To the west of the House 
of Clyne, there was some time ago a very remarkable relic of for- 
mer times, but which has lately been removed in the course of some 
agricultural improvements. Itwas supposed tohave beenat one time 
a Druidical place of worship. The following is Dr Robertson's 
description of it in the old Statistical Account: " It consists 
of a single row of twelve large stones placed upright, and so 
disposed as to form two ovals, which are joined to each other 
The areas of these ovals are equal; they are 13 feet from east 
to west, and 10 feet in the middle from north to south. At the 
west end of one of them is a stone, which rises 8 feet above the 
surface of the earth ; the other stones are from 4 to 6 feet long. 
There is also, in the middle of this oval, a flat stone, which was 
probably the altar ; it seems to have stood formerly at the east 
end, but has been thrown down by some accident. Distant 
about three paces from the eastern oval, is a circular hollow, said 
to have been a well of considerable depth, but it is now filled up ; 
its diameter at top is 8 feet. These ovals are situated on the top 
of an eminence, round which are marked out three concentric 
circles; one at the bottom, another 28 paces above the former, 
and the third 12 paces higher, immediately surrounding the ovals' 
The circumference of the first is 80, of the second, 50, and of 
the third, 35 paces." There are still remaining the ruins of five 
chapels and burying-places ; and in the neighbourhood of one of 
them, near the shore, may be traced the site of the manse or mi- 
nister's house. In some of the graves which have been dug up 
were found small earthen pitchers ; and this circumstance, along 
with the extreme smallness of the graves themselves, appears to 
furnish a strong confirmation of the opinion, that our ancestors were 
in the habit of burning their dead, and depositing their ashes in 
these rude urns.

ROSS AND CIIOMAUTV, 



III.— Population. 
Ihe iollowmg is the population of the parish, at different pe- 
riods, within the last fifty years :— 

In 1791, it amounted to 1616 
1801, . 1525. 

1811, . 1552 

1821, . 1454 

1831, . 1603 

The decrease in the period between 1791 and 1811 was mainly 
owingto the enlistment of numbers of the young men in the 42d Regi- 
ment, under the command of their countryman, the late Sir Hector 
Munro of Novar. Between 1811 and 1821, a new system of farm- 
ing was introduced, which sufficiently accounts for the extraordi- 
nary falling off in the numbers. In 1821, when, according to the 
annual mcrease of 25, the population should have amounted to 
1800, it was found to be only 1434, shewing a faUing off to the 
number of 346 persons. During that period, numbers of small 
tenants were ejected in order to make way for farmers from the 
south, possessed of some capital, who, by their superior manage- 
ment, were able to afford higher rents. The more elevated dis- 
tricts of the parish, which were altogether unsuitable for cultivation, 
were converted into sheep-walks; and numbers were thus deprived 
of all means of subsistence, and driven to seek in a foreign land 
for the shelter and protection which were denied them in their own. 
The right of landlords, however, to manage their properties accord- 
ing to their own pleasure, no one will pretend to doubt. 

As no material changes have occurred since 1831 to affect the 
ordinary increase, the population at present 1839 must amount 
to rather more than 1800. Of these about 500 reside in the vil- 
lage of Evantown, and the rest in the country. The yearly ave- 
rage of births for the last seven years is about 40 ; of deaths, 15 ; 
and of marriages, 9. This last average has continued unaltered 
since 1702. The annual number of deaths should properly be no 
more than 12, but the average for the last seven years has been 
raised to 15, by the great mortality in 1834 and 1837. In the 
former of these years, the number of deaths was 23, and in the 
latter no fewer than 28 died, chiefly old and sickly persons, who 
were cut off by influenza. 

During the last three years, there have been 4 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

Character, c. of the People. — The language generally spoken 
is an impure dialect of the Gaelic ; but it is rapidly losing ground. 
In the more Highland parts, it is better understood than English, 



KILTEAUN. 



323 



but in the low parts and in Evantown, both languages are spoken 
indifferently. The Gaelic School Society, by establishing schools 
throughout the country, have done much to eradicate the language. 
This may appear paradoxical; but it is actually the case. Those 
children that had learned to read Gaelic found no difficulty in 
mastering the English ; and they had a strong inducement to do 
so, because they found in that language more information suited 
to their capacity and taste, than could be found in their own. 
English being the language universally spoken by the higher class- 
es, the mass of the people attach a notion of superior refinement 
to the possession of it, which makes them strain every nerve to ac- 
quire it ; and it is no uncommon thing for those who have lived 
for a short time in the south, to alfect on their return, a total for- 
getfulness of the language which they had so long been in the ha- 
bit of using. The people are very temperate in their habits, and 
as most of the working people receive their wages only twice a 
year, they cannot have that command of money which would al- 
low them any improper indulgence. They are extremely hospita- 
ble. However poor their own fare may be, they are anxious to have 
something good to offer a stranger; and thus a person entering one 
of their houses would scarcely believe that, with such apparent 
plenty, the inmates were probably struggling at the time with ex- 
treme poverty. This feature in the Highland character arises, 
it is to be feared, not so much from a principle of benevolence as 
from a love of ostentation, and a spirit of independence, which has 
sometimes exercised the wit of their more refined neighbours in 
the south, under the name of " Highland pride." Their dress 
differs very little from that of the peasantry throughout the country 
generally. The kilt and trews have been long since laid aside, and 
the south country dress universally adopted. 

Many of the superstitious notions, once so abundant in the High- 
lands, still continue to linger here; but they too, like their expres- 
sive and poetical language, are fast retreating before the tide of 
improvement which has set in from the south. It is only in the 
very remote districts that ghosts are ever seen, and fairies are now 
known only by name. The belief in witchcraft, however, still con- 
tmues deeply rooted. In former times, when families, owing to 
distance and other circumstances, held little intercourse with each 
other through the day, numbers were in the habit of assembling 
together in the evening in one house, and spending the time in re- 
latmg the tales of wonder which had been handed down to them

IV. — Industry. 
Ihe number of acres in the parish, which are either cultivated 
or occasionally in tillage, may be estimated at about 3000 The 
extent under natural pasture is unknown. It is believed that very 
little more could, with any prospect of profit, be added to what is 
already cultivated j and indeed, much of what is now in cultivation 
would turn to more advantage, if kept in pasture. There is an 
undivided common between the properties of Fowlis and Inch 
coulter, containing about 600 acres. A very considerable portion 
of the parish was about the middle of last century planted with 
hrs, larch, ash, elm, oak, and other trees, suited to the climate 
Many of these trees, particularly the fir plantations, were cut down' 
a few years ago on the Fowlis property, and proved a source of 
much profit to the proprietor. Some of the hard-wood had at 
tained to such a growth as to be fit for the purposes of ship-build- 
mg, and two ships were built and launched on the property. In 
other parts of the parish, there are some thriving plantations, which 
have not yet attained their full growth. 

Betit of Land.— The rent of arable land varies, according to 
the quality, from L. 1 to L. 2, 5s. per acre. The average charge 
for summering cattle, one, two, three, and four years old, may be 
stated at 15s., L.l, L.l, 10s,, and L.2; and wintering, from 'l. I 
to L. 1, 10s. ; but this must of course greatly depend on the feeding. 
The charge for grazing a full-grown sheep is from 2s. to 3s. a yean 
The following are the wages usually given to farm la- 
bourers and country artisans : A ploughman for yearly wages 
gets a house, L. 6 in money, 6 imperial bolls of meal, 6 bolls of 
potatoes, 10 barrels of coals, and a pint of milk for one-half of the 
year— in all about L. 18. Maid servants are paid from L.3 to 
L. 4 a year. A mason gets about 2s. 6d., and a cartwright Is. 6d. 
a day. A sawyer gets Is. 8d. for the hundred feet; and a slater 
14s. the rood for laying on slates. An iron plough costs L.3, 
and a coup-cart from L. 8 to L. 10. 

Live-stock. — The common breed of sheep in the parish is the 
black-faced or aboriginal sheep of the country, or sometimes crosses 
from them. In various parts, other kinds from the south, particu- 
larly Cheviots, have been introduced ; but on the hill grazings, the 



KII.TEARN. 



325 



black-faced are found to answer much better. On the low grounds, 
Cheviots are usually fed by gentlemen for their own tables or for 
the butcher. The common breeds of cattle are the Ross-shire 
and Argyleshire. The former are now kept only by some of the 
poorer people, and are usually small in size and very inferior. 
Ayrshire cattle were, for a considerable time, kept by gentlemen 
for their own dairies; but they were nowhere kept for the rearing 
of farm stock. Mr Sim, of Drummond, in this parish, was the 
first to introduce them on a large scale, and they were found to 
answer exceedingly well. This gentleman lately introduced some 
pure short horns, which, when their good quahties are become 
sufficiently known and duly appreciated, may be expected in time 
to be universally adopted through the country. Agriculturists 
are now generally beginning to see that it is more for their advan- 
tage to improve the quality, than to increase the number of their 
cattle. 

Husbandry. — The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. 
This period is considered quite long enough to afford the tenant the 
utmost security of reaping any profit which may arise from his out- 
lays. The system of agriculture which has been pursued for many 
years back is very superior. No pains or expense have been 
spared in doing all manner of justice to the soil ; and the conse- 
quence is, that the crops raised are always equal, and often supe- 
rior to any in the country. The most common crops raised are, 
wheat, barley, oats, and some peas. Turnip husbandry has of late 
years received a great deal of attention ; as the general adoption 
of bone manure enables farmers to sow a greater quantity, which 
are used in winter for feeding hogs or for fattening stock for the 
south country markets. Draining and inclosing have been carried 
on very extensively, and in some cases very judiciously. Large 
embankments were made, some years ago, at Newton and at Bal- 
cony, and a considerable tract of land, formerly quite unprofitable 
was thus redeemed from the sea, and rendered fit for the purposes 
of agriculture. The principal improvements which have been' 
made, were usually at the expense of the tenants, without the pros- 
pect of any remuneration from the proprietors. 

The late Mr Fraser, of Inchcoulter, a gentleman of great taste, 
expended large sums in the improvement of his property. He 
divided It into moderately sized farms, well fenced and enclosed. 
Un all these farms, he erected steadings which are highly orna- 
mental to the country, and very convenient for the tenantry.

KOSS AND CROMARTY. 

Thrashing mills are now erected on most of the farms, and, when 
that IS practicable, they are driven by water. There are, at pre- 
sent, nine of them in the parish, and five of them are driven by 
water. The first flour mill in the country was erected in 1821, by 
Mr Sim. It is driven by the water of the' Skiack. Besides 'the 
flour mill, this water drives one meal, two barley, and three saw 
mills. There are also meal, flour, barley, and carding mills on 
the Aultgraad. 

Produce.~The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as that can be ascertained, may be stated as 
follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for the food of man 

or the domestic animals, ... t aeon n n 

Ofpotatoes, turnips, beet, &amp;c. . . ' 2400 0 n 

Of grass, mcluding natural, pasture, and cultivated grass, . 3600 0 n 

Gardens and orchards, . S » • oouu u U 

Fisheries, . . ,  '  2 n n 

Miscellaneous produce, . . . " _ ' 200 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, . . L. 13090 0 "o 

Of course, this can only be regarded as an approximation ; but 
It is believed to be very near the real amount. It is usually cal- 
culated that the gross produce of a property should be thrice the 
rental ; and it will be seen that the above amount bears very near- 
ly that ratio to the estimated real annual value of the land. 

The valued rent of the whole parish is L.3149, 9s. 6d. Scots. 
The real value in 1791 was estimated at L. 1500 Sterling; in 
1810, at L.3068, 8s. 5d.; and at present, 1839, it is about 
L. 5300. 

There is no manufiicture carried on to any extent. Even the 
home-made stuff's, which the peasantry used to wear, are now near 
ly discontinued, as they find it cheaper to purchase than to manu- 
facture them. In many respects, it is very desirable that a ma- 
nufacture of some kind should be established in the village of 
Evantown, where there are so many unemployed children, who 
might thus be enabled to assist their parents in providing for their 
support. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town, c— There is no market-town in the parish; 
and the nearest is Dingwall, at the distance of six miles. There 
is one village, called Evantown, containing about 100 houses, 
and a population of about 500. This village, which had no 
existence thirty years ago, is built upon a waste piece of land,

and differs from all others in the country, by its regular and neat 
appearance. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs annually held in it, on the first 
Tuesdays of June and December; but, since the general intro- 
duction of shops into all the villages, they are not well attended. 

Means of Communication.— The means tff communication en- 
joyed by the parish are very considerable. Ever since 1819, the 
mail-coach passes north and south through it daily; whilst there 
are, for the greater part of the year, smacks sailing to and from 
Leith, London, and Newcastle, principally in the corn, wood, and 
coal trade. The great line of Parliamentary road runs along the 
shore through the breadth of the parish, and communicates with 
the northern parts by means of excellent county roads. In the more 
remote parts of the mountainous districts, the roads are so wretch- 
edly bad as scarcely to deserve the name. The Parliamentary 
line passes over two neat and substantial bridges, one at the east, 
and the other at the west end of the village of Evantown. There 
are no harbours in the parish ; but there are two or three situations 
where they might very easily be erected, and where vessels of con- 
siderable burden could conveniently load and unload. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is situated on the coast, near 
the south-east end of the parish, and is distant about twenty'miles 
from Its north-west boundaries. The situation is particularly in- 
convenient for the attendance of the people. At the time when 
churches and manses were first built in this country, the small spots 
in cultivation lay principally along the shore, and this may account 
for the inconvenience of situation. At any rate, more attention 
seems to have been paid to the comfort of the minister than to 
the. convenience of the people. Even that, however, has failed to 
be secured; for a clergyman who isin the habit of visiting his na- 
rish will find the labour of that duty greatly increased. The pre- 
sent church was built in 1791, and is a neat and very commodious 
building, quite sufficient for the accommodation of the peonle 
It contains 78 pews, 786 feet in length, which, at the rate 

' to 'Sf M : ""'' accommodation 

to 524. More than 700, however, can find room with comfort, 
If necessary. No rents are taken by the heritors for the seats ; and 
there are some forms exclusively devoted to the use of the poor. 
1 hese can accommodate about 60 persons. 

The manse was originally built in 1762, and was repaired and 
much enlarged in 1806. It is a very commodious building, con-

taining several large and airy rooms, with all the necessary offices 
and out-houses attached in excellent repair. The extent of he 
glebe is about 9 imperial acres arable ; but a considerable portion 
of it consists of land redeemed from the sea by the present incum- 
bent. This part is always subject to encroachments by the sea and 
river ; and the embankments require constant repairs. The grass 
glebe consists of one acre of very little value, separated from the 
rest of the glebe by the Skiack, and of a few detached pieces of 
carse ground covered at high water by the tide. The stipend con- 
sists of 16 chalders or 256 bolls, half oatmeal and half barley, for 
which the heritors pay according to the fiars prices in the county 
of Ross. All the ministers were settled by a popular call until 
1770. Mr George Watson was, soon thereafter, settled by a Crown 
presentation ; as were also his two successors. 

There is one chapel connected with the United Secession in 
the village of Evantown. The minister is one of three paid bv 
that body for preaching in Highland districts, and receives a sa- 
lary of L. 80. Without such aid, no minister could live upon the 
voluntary supportofthe people, their earnings being barely sufficient 
to support their own families. The chapel can contain 400 ; but 
only about 170 attend regularly : and of these only two or three fami- 
lies are really Seceders. The average number of communicants 
in the Established Church is 28 ; and of these 14 are heads of 
families. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish : the parochial 
school at Drummond, and an unendowed school in the village of 
Evantown. In the former, the following are the branches taught, 
and the quarterly fees, as settled by the heritors in May 1838, viz. 
English reading, 2s., with grammar, 2s. 6d., with arithmetic and 
geography, 3s. 6d. ; Latin and Greek, 4s. The schoolmaster's 
salary formerly consisted of 1 chalder barley, 2 bolls meal, and 
100 merks; but in 1828 it was fixed at L. 30, with a garden. 
The yearly amount of the fees is about L. 20. The heritors fur- 
nish the legal accommodations. The number of the young be- 
tween six and fifteen years of age who are unable to read or write, 
cannot be precisely ascertained ; but in the neighbourhood of the 
parish school, they are very few. By far the greater part of the 
people can read the Scriptures, and the few who cannot are aged 
people, who had no opportunity of learning in their youth. Were 
one to form a judgment from the small number attending the 
schools, it might be thought that the people are not in general 



KILTEARN. 329 

alive to the benefits of education; but a closer view of the subject 
will le;id to a very different opinion. Such is the general poverty, 
that the parents find it necessary to employ thoseof their children 
who can do any work, to earn something for their maintenance : 
and it is only in winter, when 'no out-dobr employment is to be 
•had, that the children can attend school at all. Small though the 
expense of education be, it could scarcely be expected that a poor 
man, with L. 6 a-year, could clothe himself, a wife, and perhaps 
half-a-dozen children, and have any surplus to bestow on the edu- 
cation of his family. There are, it is true, some noble instances 
of parents submitting to the greatest sacrifices and privations in 
order to educate their children ; and widows have been known to 
spend the day in hard toil, and the greater part of the night in 
spinning or knitting, with this laudable object in view. Such in- 
stances, however creditable to these individuals, cannot but indi- 
cate some defects in a system which requires such sacrifices, and 
presents such obstacles to the education of the poor. There is at 
least one-half of the population so distant from the school that the 
attendance of the children is rendered quite impossible : and two 
additional schools are in consequence required ; one more, indeed, 
is absolutely necessary. 

Poor mid Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
..receiving parochial aid, for some years back, amounts to 63. At 
present, there are 57 on the roll. This reduction in the number 
has been partly occasioned by the great mortality among the aged 
and poor in the spring of 1837, and partly by a regulatioli adopted 
by the heritors and session in that same year, which has the effect 
. of preventing all who can do anything for their own maintenance 
1 from applying for relief. This regulation requires of all who wish 
1 to be placed on the roll, to sign a disposition in favour of the kirk- 
. session, leaving all their effects to the poor after their lawful debts 
; are paid. When a husband oc wife is admitted, the effects con- 
itinue in the possession of the survivor till death, when they fall to 
1 the session. The poor are divided into three classes, fho.e in 
tthe first class at present containing 14, receive 8s. a-year; the 
.second class of 1.3, receives 6s. ; and the third class, comprisino- 
Chiefly those who can do something for their own support, contains 
• 30 persons, who receive 3s. If any of the funds remain after this, 
Itney are given away in small donations to a few indigent persons 
mho are not on the roll. The money thus distributed arises from 
Tvarious sums mortified, at different periods, by natives of the pa- 

ROSS AND CROMARTY. v

rish for the benefit of the poor, which at present amount to L.400, 
laid out at 5 per cent.; and from the church collections, which for 
the last seven years average L. 4, Us. together with mortcloth 
dues and other small sums, — in all amounting to about L.28. The 
sum at the disposal of the session for distribution, after deducting 
clerk's salary, &amp;c. usually exceeds L.17. The miserable pittance 
thus allowed to each in the year, scarcely exceeding the weekly 
allowance of an able-bodied pauper in England, is totally inade- 
quate to the relief of their distress. The greatest misery and want 
prevail in consequence, to an extent that would seem incredible to 
those who have not actually witnessed them. It is no uncommon 
thing for an unmarried female or lonely widow, who has survived 
all her friends, to live in a wretched hovel, without fire, bed-clothes, 
or food, in the depth of winter. Such a state of things in a country 
abounding with all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of 
life, indicates a defect somewhere. One undoubted cause of the 
evil may be found in the low wages of labourers, which are barely 
sufficient to support a life of drudgery and toil, without enabling 
them, though they were so inclined, to make provision for an old 
ao-e of misery and want. There is no assessment of the parish by 
the session for the relief of the poor ; but some provision is abso- 
lutely necessary. 

Those who can contribute any thing for their own support, ma- . 
nifest the greatest reluctance to receive aid from the parish, and 
regard it as highly degrading ; but it is to be feared that this 
praiseworthy feeling is fast losing ground. It could scarcely be 
expected, indeed, that a spirit of independence could long resist 
the effects of absolute want and misery. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
It now remains only to mention briefly a few of the more strik- 
ing differences betwixt the present state of the parish and that 
which existed at the time of the former Statistical Account. Snice 
1791, when the former Account was written, the face of the parish 
has physically undergone a very striking change. At that period, 
the low grounds were divided into small farms occupied by tenants, 
none of whom paid rent to the amount of L.IOO. There were 
only two, indeed, who reached L. 80. These small farms have now 
been thrown together and improved, so as to afford rents of L.300, 
L. 500, and even L. 700; and the land, instead of presenting a 
few detached spots, occasionally under crop, is now divided into 
large and highly cultivated fields. JBut it will be unnecessary to 



KILTEARN. 



331 



say any more on this subject, as the principal improvements have 
been noticed under the head Industry. 

The houses [of the peasantry, some years ago, were merely 
wretched hovels — themselves, their cattle, pigs, and poultry living 
under the same roof. At present, there are many neat and com- 
fortable cottages in the country, and well built houses in the village. 

It is not in the physical appearance alone of the parish, that a 
change is visible. Those who are old enough to remember the 
former period declare, without exception, that a change for the 
worse has taken place in the moral character of the people. Some 
ascribe this to the increase of villages throughout the country : 
others, laudatores temporis acti, are disposed to ascribe it to the 
gradual deterioration which this world has physically and morally 
undergone since men began to record their opinions of the times 
in which they lived. Whatever discrepancy there may be in the 
causes assigned, there is but one opinion as to the fact, that vice 
and immorality are now more common than formerly. The po- 
verty and degraded state of the lower classes appear to furnish the 
only rational explanation. In the former state of the parish, many 
occupied that respectable rank in society which is now confined to 
a few. These felt an interest in maintaining a good character, 
and their conduct had a beneficial influence on all immediately 
under them. There are, however, few or no breaches of the law 
which require the interference of the magistrate ; and only one 
case of criminal prosecution has been known to occur since the 
beginning of this century, and even that one was not of an aggra- 
vated nature. 

In ancient times, before those useful members of society the le- 
gal functionaries had effected a lodgment in the vicinity, for hap- 
pily none have yet been induced to settle in the parish, it would 
appear that when any misdemeanour was committed, they adopted 
a more expeditious process than the modern one for bringing the 
offender to justice. A dispute having arisen at the beginning of 
the seventeenth century between the Baron of Fowlis and the Laird 
of TuUoch, about the boundaries of their estates at a part where 
they were conterminous, the matter was referred to arbiters, and 
witnesses were called and examined on the disputed ground. There 
was a large stone, which was alleged by the one party to lie in the 

" A very strtking example of the glorious uncertainty of the law was lately fuinisli- 
ed iri this parish ; for n process that commenced in 1 706, about marches between Cro- 
mertie and Fowlis, was carried on with various success, until it was finally settled bv 
judicial arbitration in 1S33.

line of the march. One of the Tulloch witnesses stepped upon the 
disputed ground, and declared that he was ready to swear that the 
ground on which he stood belonged to Tulloch. Either his man- 
ner of expression or his known character excited suspicion. The 
other party seized upon him, pulled off his shoes, and actually 
found that, to avoid all possibility of perjuring himself, he had taken 
- the precaution, before leaving home, to line the soles of his shoes 
with earth from the Tulloch garden. There was no tedious trial 
by jury. The poor wretch was immediately dragged to the stone 
and his ears cut off either upon or beside it ; and from this circum- 
stance, it has ever since borne the name of clachnacluais, or the 
stone of the ear.

PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER FLYTER, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Alness appears to be the only name which has, at any 
period, been given to this parish. It is compounded of two Gaelic 
words, auld, signifying a burn or small river, and neas, a point. 

Extent, Boundaries, Sc. — The extreme length of this parish 
from north to south,, though from the mountainous and unculti- 
vated character of a great part of it, it has not been exactly ascer- 
tained, may be stated at 20 miles. The breadth from east to 
west varies very considerably at different points, and may be con- 
sidered as giving an average of 5 miles throughout the entire 
length. The parish of Alness is bounded on the north by imagi- 
nary lines dividing it from that of Kincardine; and on the south, 
by the shores of the Cromarty Frith. On the east, it is divided 
from the parish of Rosskeen by the river of Alness ; and on the 
west, from that of Kiltearn by the river Auldgrande. 

Topographical Appearances. — The general appearance of the 
parish is pleasing, as it is well wooded, and presents to the eye an 
agreeable variety of moor and cultivated land. The lands lying 

' Drrtwn up by .Tames Flytcr, A. M. Alness. 



ALNESS,

in the southern extremity, and on the shores of the Cromarty 
Frith, are in general flat, and, with very little exception, cultivat- 
ed. Towards the north, however, the character of the country is 
entirely changed, and becomes mountainous and barren. The 
hills, though some of them are of considerable height, do not occur 
in any continuous chain or group, but, like the generality of those 
in this county, present a scattered and straggling appearance. 
There is nothing very remarkable in the structure or composition of 
any of them ; but one, having an elevation of about 1000 feet above 
the level of the sea, may be conjectured, both from its name, Fy- 
rish, and from its proximity to the shores of the frith, to have been 
employed at some remote period as a station for beacon lights. 

Climate. — The climate may be described as dry and salubrious. 
There are no diseases which can be said to be peculiar to, or even 
prevalent in, the parish ; but, on the contrary, the inhabitants gene- 
rally, and those of one of the highland districts in particular, are 
characterized by their health and longevity. It is evident also 
that the climate has undergone a considerable change for the bet- 
ter since the year 1793, when the former Statistical Account was 
written ; for, since that period, the important operation of drainage, 
together with other improvements in agriculture which have been 
introduced, and the immense extent of moorland which has been 
planted, must have greatly modified the general state of the at 
mosphere. 

Hydrography. — The only body of salt water connected vrith the 
district is the Cromarty Frith, which forms the southern bound- 
ary of this parish. The entire length of the frith does not ex 
ceed twenty miles, and at that part which is contiguous to Alness 
its average breadth may be stated at two miles. So great, however, 
is the quantity of fresh water continually flowing into it from the 
rivers and occasional mountain torrents, that the character of the 
water as regards its saltness is greatly modified. The water is ge- 
nerally considered to decrease in strength in proportion to its dis- 
tance inland, and at this point it may be regarded as having lost 
one-half of its saltness, and is therefore, by experiment, only one- 
sixty-fourth part denser than common fresh water. The parish 
is well supplied with fresh water, in all the forms in which it is 
found collected. Many springs are to be met with in the diff'e- 
rent districts, all of them supplying excellent water, and generally 

 Fairc is the Giiulic wjvd for beacon or walch.

of a low temperature. There are none, however, in which the 
water has any peculiar mineral character, except one or two bear- 
ing a small quantity of lime in solution. In the northern dis- 
tricts there are two fresh-water lochs, each of them about three 
miles in length, with an average breadth of one mile. Neither of 
them is destitute of the ordinary beauties of highland scenery ; 
but the more remarkable is the easterly one, which is called Muire 
or Mary, taking its name from a Roman Catholic place of wor- 
ship, built in a romantic glen at one extremity of the loch, and the 
ruins of which still exist. This collection of water is of no great 
extent, yet, from its position, and the immense height of the rocky 
precipices which rise on either side, it affords an excellent speci- 
men of what may be termed the sublime in mountain scenery. 
Another feature in its character, and one which is worthy of no- 
tice, is its great depth, which might be inferred as well from the 
immense height of the rocks on either side, as from the fact, that 
even in the niost severe and protracted frosts, its water has never 
been known to freeze farther than a few yards from the side. 

There is no river which can properly be said to belong to this 
parish, for though both the Alness and Auldgrande take their rise 
within its bounds, they rather bound than intersect it. The for- 
■ mer originates in Loch Muire, which has been already noticed, and 
after flowing for about fifteen miles in a winding direction, falls 
into the Cromarty Frith. Though larger, it is not, however, so in- 
teresting or so worthy of remark as the Auldgrande, which, from 
the singular character of part of its channel, forms one of the most 
striking natural curiosities in the north. Issuing from a small but 
beautifully situated loch, at the foot of Ben Wyvis, it flows for se- 
veral miles, gradually increasing in size, in consequence of the 
number of torrents which pour themselves into it from the neigh- 
bouring hills. When within three miles of the sea, its banks on 
either side suddenly heighten and contract, and the waters be- 
coming invisible, from the depth of the gulf, and the quantity of 
under-wood growing on its sides, their presence is discovered only 
by the hollow roaring within, resembling at times the noise of con- 
tinued thunder. The whole length of the chasm is about a mile 
and a-half ; but so near do the sides approach each other, that boys 
have been known to cross on branches of trees, growing from the 
sides, and stretching acrosp the centre. There is no convenient 
way of crossing the chasni, except at one part where a wooden 
bridge has been thrown across. But even here, from the great 



ALNESS. 



335 



depth and narrov/ness of the opening, an observer, though obtain- 
ing a view directly downwards, can scarcely discern the water, as it 
boils and hisses below. A stone of ordinary density, dropped froni 
the bridge, strikes the surface of the water in three seconds, giving 
a depth of about 140 feet, which may be regarded as the average 
depth of the chasm unoccupied by water. The depth beneath the 
water is not so easily ascertained, and most probably varies consi- 
derably at different points in the length. 

On examining the course of the Auldgrande, two very interest- 
ing subjects of inquiry are naturally suggested : Is, What are the 
causes which have operated in the production of a phenomenon so 
unusual And 2tZ, what are those traditions, which, though now fast 
dying away, the superstitious character of the Highlanders cannot 
have failed to connect with a place of such a description  These 
questions, however, will more properly find a place under the re- 
spective heads of Geology and Antiquities. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — To the researches of the geologist, 
the parish of Alness presents a field of inquiry neither very inte- 
resting nor instructive. The best geological section that can per- 
haps be obtained of the district, is that given by the course of the 
Alness ; and from an examination of the rocks denuded by this 
stream, together with those which appear occasionally on the sides 
of the hills, it may be inferred that the parish rests entirely on the 
old red sandstone formation, leaning to the north on gneiss, and 
some of the other primitive rocks of the Wernerian nomenclature. 
The sandstone strata, as laid bare by the Alness, exhibit great uni- 
formity in texture, composition, and external appearance ; but they 
have yielded no traces of organic remains, either animal or vege- 
table, to any observations as yet made upon them. In ascending 
the stream, the strata are found to dip to the south-east by east, 
at an angle varying from 12° to 20° till the observer arrives at a 
certain point, about two miles from the Frith, when they change 
their direction, and dip at much the same angle to the opposite 
point of the compass. Immediately beneath the sandstone occurs 
a bed of conglomerate, which also belongs to the old red sandstone 
formation. It is chiefly composed of rounded pebbles of quartzite 
or quartz rock, and sometimes of pure quartz. These rounded 
masses vary in size, from a small fraction of an inch to a foot in 
diameter, and are held together by an arenaceous cement. 

Notice has been taken in a former part of this account of the 
extraordinary chasm through which the Auldgrande flows for some 



33G 



IIOSS AND CROMARTY. 



distance. It is not, strictly speaking, within the parish of Alness, 
but, as it forms part of the western boundary to the parish, it ap- 
pears wortlw of notice, especially as it is interesting in a geologi- 
cal point of view. The chasm, as has already been stated, is up- 
wards of 140 feet in depth, and about a niile and a quarter in 
length, occurring in a thick bed of conglomerate, apparently of the 
old red sandstone period. 

In' order to account for its formation, one of two opinions must 
be adopted. The water must either by continual action have 
worn down the channel to the present depth, or the fissure must 
be referred entirely to a fault in the rock, the chasm occasioned by 
the fault having either remained unoccupied, or been filled up with 
loose material, which could offer no great re.sistance to running 
water. The former supposition is rendered more probable, if we 
suppose that when the water first began to flow, the rock was softer 
than it nov,' is. Each of the pebbles which form the conglomerate 
would then, when once set in motion, lend its aid by abrasion in 
deepening the channel. 

The conclusion that such a process gave rise to the chasm, is 
therefore probable at first sight; but on a closer examination, it 
is not found consistent with observation on many streams which 
flow over exactly the same species of rock. On the contrar}', 
where a stream flows over this species of conglomerate, which is 
very frequently the case in this district, the water seldom or never 
finds its way further than a few feet into the rock. From the cir- 
cumstance that the rock in which the fissure has been made is a 
conglomerate, and not a regularly stratified mass, we are deprived 
of the additional confirmation to the supposition of a fault, which 
might be derived from strm and other appearances usually observ- 
ed on the sides of shifted strata. But the single fact of its great 
depth, taken in connection with what is observed in similar streams, 
suflficiently warrants us to conclude, that the chasm has not been 
owing to any abrasive process in the course of the stream, but must 
be referred to a pre-existing fault. 

Ores. — About five miles from the Frith, and on the property of 
Finlay Munro of Lealdie, an iron-ore has been discovered, which, 
from all appearances, may be of considerable extent. Previous to 
the writing of the former Statistical Account, a specimen was sent 
to the Carron Company, at their own desire, which was found to 
Yield 75 lbs. iron per cwt. The rock in which the vein occurs is 
a gneiss, and it is worthy of remark, as confirmatory of an obser- 



ALNESS. 



337. 



vation already made in geology, that the tnelallic vein is injected 
into the primary rock, at a point not many yards distant from its 
junction with the aqueous or sedimentary strata. 

Boulders. — The only remaining feature which is in the least de- 
gree striking in the geology of this parish, is the frequent occur- 
rence throughout its surface of immense boulders or erratic blocks 
of stone. In the more cultivated parts, these obstructions to the 
plough have for the most part been removed, by blasting or other- 
wise : but in the moorland districts, and studding the sides of the 
hills, they are seen in great numbers, and of various shapes and 
sizes. These rounded masses belong entirely to the primary class 
of rocks, being composed either of granite or gneiss ; and as they 
must have been transported from a great distance to occupy their 
present locality, it becomes a problem of considerable interest to 
discover where they occurred in situ. 

Zoology. — The animals to be found in this parish are all of the 
same species as those commonly to be met with throughout the 
country ; and it is therefore unnecessary to notice them particu- 
larly. In the lower parts of the parish, hares, rabbits and par- 
tridges are to be met with in great abundance ; and in the more 
hilly and uncultivated districts are found moorfowlor grouse, black- 
cock and roe. Foxes were very numerous some years ago, but they 
seem now to be totally extirpated. Of the rarer birds existing in 
this country, the eagle, pheasant, and ptarmigan, are occasionally 
to be seen in this parish. The fish commonly taken in the Frith 
are of those kinds which live indifferently in fresh or salt water; 
the water in the Frith having, as has already been stated, not above 
one-half the strength of undiluted salt water. In the rivers and 
lochs, but principally in the latter, are to be found several species 
of black trout, which, in consequence perhaps of their not being 
regularly taken, frequently attain to an immense size. 

The salmon and salmon trout taken in the Frith and rivers are 
of a very superior quality, and would be very numerous, were it not 
for the poaching and fishing during close season, which for many 
years has prevailed to a great extent. It may here be remarked, 
that the salmon-fishing along the shore of the Frith is uncom- 
monly late, no fish being taken, in general, till the month of June. 
The salmon are supposed, by those having charge of the fishing, 
to go up the rivers to spawn during the month of September, and 
not to return again till the beginning of February.

n. — Civil History. 
1 here does not appear to have been any account of this parish 
drawn up, either printed or in manuscript, if we except the former 
Statistical Account, written by the Rev. Angus Bethune, one of 
Its ministers. The session records are, perhaps, the only written 
source from which information can be expected, as to the former 
state of Highland parishes ; but even these, in the present case, 
are wanting, till within a comparatively recent period. The re- 
cords are said to have been regularly kept in former times, but 
seem to have disappeared at or soon after the death.of Mr Fraser, 
one of the ministers of this parish, who died in October 1769. 
The documents in question were most probably carried away 
among the papers of that individual. The minutes of session 
have since that period been regularly entered and preserved ; but, 
not having even the claims of antiquity to recommend them to no- 
tice, they contain nothing interesting or important to the general 
reader. 

The traditional history of the parish appears to have been more 
considerable, if we may judge from the fragments which can still 
be gathered. It is now, however, fast dying away with the language 
originally spoken. One or two circumstances, it may be proper to 
state, which, though they possess no higher authority than that of 
oral tradition, are, nevertheless, founded in fact, and are therefore 
worthy of notice. 

It is said that, soon after the accession of William III., the pa- 
rish was visited by a famine of such severity, that in one district, 
extensive as well as populous, the number of the inhabitants was 
reduced to three. On that occasion, if the accounts of tradition 
can be believed, the people were under the necessity of forming 
common coffins, into which the dead, being thrown promiscuously, 
were committed to the earth, without even the ordinary solemni- 
ties of funeral. 

Connected with another period, equally interesting in the his- 
tory of Scotland, some incidents occurred, which are worthy of no- 
tice. The period to which we allude is that which succeeded the 
restoration of Charles, when an attempt was made to do away with 
the Presbyterian form of worship in Scotland, and to introduce 
Prelacy in its ropm. The minister of Alness at this time was a 
Mr Mackilligen, who, from his conduct, appears to have been a 
man of no ordinary strength of mind. In the year 1662, Paterson 
was ordained Bishop of Ross, and all the clergy throughout the 



ALNESS.

country being commanded by order of council to attend the dio- 
cesan meetings, Macliilligen, together with three others, were the 
only ministers in the diocese of Ross who possessed the inclination, 
together with the strength of principle, to resist the innovations. 
These four individuals were, in consequence of their resistance, 
immediately ejected from their charges, but Mackilligen, possessing 
more boldness than the rest, remained in Alness discharging his 
duties, notwithstanding the threats of bishop and council, which 
had ordained that no nonconforming minister should take up his 
abode within twenty miles of his former church. " Mr Mackil- 
ligen, a faithful and active preacher of the forbidden doctrines," 
says Mr Miller, in his Scenes and Legends, seems to have given 
him the bishop so much trouble, that he even threatened to ex- 
communicate him ; but the minister, regarding his threat in the 
proper light, replied to it by comparing him to Balaam, the wicked 
prophet, who went forth to curse Israel, and to Shimei, the son of 
Gera, who cursed David. The joke spread, for as such was it re- 
garded, and Paterson, who had only the sanctity of his office to 
oppose to the personal sanctity of his opponent, deemed it prudent 
to urge the threat no farther. He had the mortification of being 
laughed at for having urged it so far. There is a little hollow 
among the hills, about three miles from the house of Fowlis, and 
not much farther from Alness, in the gorge of which the eye com- 
mands a wide prospect of the lower lands, and the whole Frith of 
Cromarty. It lies, too, on the extreme edge of the cultivated part 
of the country, for behind there stretches only a brown uninha- 
bited desert ; and in this hollow, the neighbouring Presbyterians 
used to meet for the purpose of religious worship. On some oc- 
casions, they were even bold enough to assemble in the villages. In 
the summer of 1675, Mr Mackilligen, assisted by his brethren of 
Tain and Cromarty, and the Laird of Brea, celebrated the com- 
munion at Obsdale, in the house of the lady-dowager of Fowlis. 
" A party had been despatched at the instance of the bishop," 
continues the same author, « to take Mackilligen prisoner j but 
misinformed regarding the place where the meeting was held, they 
proceeded to his house at Alness, and spent so much time in pil- 
laging his garden, that, before they reached Obsdale, he had got 
out of their way ; but he fell into the hands of his enemy, the bishop, 
the following year, and during his long imprisonment in the Bass, 
for to such was he sentenced, he contracted a disease of which he 
died."

Eminent Characters. — In a parish, where, till within a compara- 
tively recent period, the prevailing, and indeed almost the only lan- 
guage in use was the Gaelic, few instances can be expected of indivi- 
duals rising to literary eminence. Among that class of the people, 
however, which an acquaintance with the English language enabled 
to keep pace with the march of modern improvement, such instances 
have not been wanting. Few names, we believe, connected with this 
part of the country are more deserving of notice, than that of Mr 
James Fraser, oneof the ministers of Alness. Thiseminent individual 
was born in the year 1700, and was the son of the Rev. John Fraser, 
also a minister of the parish, and well known on account of the suf- 
ferings which he endured for his steady adherence to the principles 
and constitution of the Church of Scotland, during the persecu- 
tion of 1679 or 1680. The Rev. James Fraser, in whose history 
we are more immediately interested, was very young when his 
father died, and could not, therefore, be immediately appointed to 
the parish, but on the death of Mr Daniel Mackilligen,"who was 
the immediate successor of his father, he was inducted, being then 
tjventy-six years of age. He appears to have been a man as much 
distinguished for the talents necessary to eminence as a public 
character, as for the virtues which rendered him so much esteem- 
ed as a private Christian. For his literary eminence, he was, how- 
ever, chiefly indebted to his great strength of judgment, and 
acuteness in Biblical criticism. This talent he displayed in a cri- 
tical work on Sanctification ; and in a sketch of his life, prefixed 
to the work, we find him spoken of in the following terms. As it 
will serve in some degree to point out the nature of the work, we 
may quote the words. " His distinguished abihties as a sacred 
critic appear in the following treatise, from the strong and mas- 
terly manner in which he has examined some of the most eminent 
Socinian and Arminian commentators. The judicious reader will 
easily see that the author's understanding was quick, clear, and 
penetrating, his judgment solid, and his learning very extensive. 
His public ministrations were highly edifying, and contained rich 
entertainment for the learned as well as the unlearned." 

The next individual who appears particularly deserving of notice 
in the biographical history of this parish, is General Sir Hector 
Munro, K.B. He was one of the principal proprietors when the 
former Statistical Account was written ; and rendered himself fa- 
mous by his exploits in India during the war which was carried 
on there towards the close of the eighteenth century. 



ALNESS.

From an anecdote which is still current in the family of the 
Munros, it appears that he owed his first commission in the King's 
service, and probably the whole of his after success and military 
glory, to a circumstance in itself trivial. A lady of considerable 
rank, happening to travel alone in a thinly peopled part of the 
country, was left in a helpless and unprotected state, in her car- 
riage, from her postilion getting intoxicated. Sir Hector, then 
quite a youth, finding her in this condition, took the place of the 
drunken coachman, and rendered her considerable service. For 
his activity and gallantry on this occasion, the lady was so grateful, 
that she did not relax her exertions, till, by her influence, she had 
procured him a commission in the army. Without entering mi- 
uutely into the particulars of his life, some idea may be given of his 
eminence as an officer, by quoting shortly from an interesting ac- 
count of the military operations in which he was engaged, written by 
an officer in the same service. The first occasion on which Sir 
Hector Munro signalized himself in India was immediately after 
the hostile intentions of France had become manifest ; when the 
British Parliament and the East India Company boldly determined 
to strike the first blow in the east. Government had at this time 
resolved, as the Mahratta war had already employed so many of the 
Company's troops, to send out a squadron with fresh supplies, and 
1000 Highlanders, composing the seventy-third regiment, to assist 
in the reduction of Pondicherry, and for other services in India. 
" It happened, however," says the officer to whom we are indebted 
for information on the subject, " that intelligence of this resolution 
had no sooner been transmitted overland to India, than the presi- 
dency of Madrass found means to collect force enough themselves 
for that purpose, before the seventy-third could arrive ; with which 
Major General Sir Fleeter Munro quickly laid siege to Pondicherry; 
and, notwithstanding every effort of M. Bellecombe and his officers, 
the garrison was obliged to capitulate in less than six weeks after- 
wards; and, according to orders, the ram]arts of that extensive 
and beautiful city were completely levelled with the ground." 

Passing over several actions on the Coromandel coast, in all of 
which Sir Hector Munro signalized himself more or less, but 
in which he acted either as second in command, or in conjunction 
with other officers, we may notice the taking of Negapatnam, which 
was conducted and finally accomplished under his sole command. 
The garrison had been strongly reinforced by a large detachment of 
Hyder Ally's troops, and consisted, at the time it was besieged, of 



342 



llOSS AND CROMAUTV. 



7000 Sepoys and upwards of 600 Europeans. Sir Hector Munro 
having taken command of the army, sat down before the place on 
the 21st of October, and before the middle of next month, the 
garrison was obliged to capitulate. 

After describing minutely the taking of Negapatnam, the officer 
from whom we have already quoted gives the following testimony 
to his merit, alluding at the same time to his former services at 
Pondicherry. « Thus were two of the most formidable foreign 
garrisons upon the coast of Coromandel razed to the ground, un- 
der the conduct and command of Major- General Sir Hector Miinro ; 
and what to his honour as a man, will equal his reputation as I 
general, was his humane and magnanimous carriage towards those 
whom the fortune of war had placed within his power. The be- 
sieged and captive inhabitants of either place, instead of havino- 
cause to accuse him with the wanton commission of cruelties and 
injustice— an impeachment but too common in this licentious 
country, have echoed throughout the whole tract of Asia, the most 
grateful paneygrics upon his benevolence, humanity, ffenerositv 
and good faith." ' 

Land-owners.~The proprietors of the parish are, H. A. J. 
Munro of Novar, Major- General Munro of Teaninich, and Finlay 
Munro of Lealty. Of these he first mentioned possesses in extent 
more than two-thirds of the parish ; but a great part of the pro- 
perty being either moorland or plantation, is chiefly valuable as 
affording pasturage for sheep and for its game. In order to con- 
trast the present state of the parish as regards the extent and di- 
vision of property, with that which existed at a period considerably 
earlier, it may here be stated, that in the year 1726 there were 
twelve proprietors of land in the parish. These were Munro of 
Novar; M'Kenzie of Assynt; Munro of Fyrish ; M'Intosh of 
Contlich ; M'Leod of Culcragie ; Mackilligen of Balachragan ; 
Munro of Lealty ; Munro of Caul ; Simson of the Quarter ot Al- 
ness ; Munro of Ceanuachdrach : and Fraser of Cromraon. 

J7itiquities.— Under the head Antiquities, there is not much 
that is interesting connected with this parish. At a place called 
Multivie, two cairns were discovered some years ago, buried to a 
considerable depth in the earth. They appear to have been sim- 
ply square enclosures, or boxes, constructed by placing together 
immense flat stones. On being opened, they were found to con- 
tain human bones, which are said to have been of a very large 
size. These extraordinary repositories of the dead, however, 



ALNESS. 



343 



cease to have any peculiar -interest attached to them, as so many 
of a similar description have been discovered throughout the coun- 
try. The custom of burying in this manner appears to have been 
an honour conferred in ancient times, on the chiefs of clans, or 
on individuals distinguished in some other way. In the hill 
ground, and almost on the march line which separates the pro- 
perties of Teaninich and Ardross, there is a stone of remarkable 
size, known by the name of " Clach airidh a Mhinistir." The 
tradition connected with this stone has shared the fate of many 
others, and nothing is now left us but the name. From the name, 
which signifies the minister's shealing, we may infer that there ex- 
isted there a piece of land, which was employed as grazing or 
pasturage ground by one of the ministers of the parish. 

On a bleak and dreary spot, in the moor not far from Gildermorry, 
there is also a stone or rather two immense stones, piled one up- 
on the other, in a very extraordinary manner, and having the ap- 
pearance at first view of being the effect of art rather than of na- 
ture. Among the nearest inhabitants, it is known by the name of 
" Claeh nam ban" which signifies the stone of the toomen. The 
tradition regarding this place must have originated at a remote 
period, and is now very imperfectly related. Several women, it 
appears, were proceeding during the depth of winter to the Ro- 
man Catholic Chapel at Gildermorry, and carrying with them 
bundles of hemp or flax. When near this place, they were over- 
taken by a snow storm, and, in order to escape the rigour of the 
blast, they took shelter under the pile. The storm, however, 
which was of very long continuance, and almost unexampled se- 
verity, was then only in its birth : and not for many weeks could  
any trace be discovered of the women of the stone. When the 
covering of snow had at length been partially removed, some of 
their friends coming to the spot, found their bodies lying at the 
foot of the pile, and beside them was erected a stick, which they 
had probably found at the place, on which was suspended one of 
the bundles of hemp as a memorial of their fate. 

In a glen at one extremity of Loch Muire, which has already 
been noticed under the head Hydrography, there are still to be 
seen the ruins of a Roman Catholic place of worship, from which 
circumstance we may conclude, that that district of the parish 
which is at present inhabited only by a few individuals, was, at a 
former period, at least thinly peopled. The chapel occupies a 
very romantic situation at the head of the loch, and is surrounded 



''' ROSS And cromautv. 

by a burying- ground. It is only 40 feet long by 18 broad in 
tlie ms.de ; but the walls are almost 4 feet in thickness, and so 
indurated has the lime which cements the stones become, that 
It 13 almost mipossible to separate them. There is no date now 
distmgmshable to show at what period it was built. Near the 
chapel, there is a spring called " lUair na Muirer or Mary's 
Well, obviously taking its name from the circumstance of its being 
consecrated to the Virgin Mary. The water of the spring was 
thought by the people to have" the peculiar virtue of healing dis- 
ease either in man or beast, provided they visited the spot and 
under this impression, pieces of coloured cloth were left as ofTer- 
mgs to the numen of the place. The offerings made to the offi- 
ciating priest were probably more substantial and valuable dona- 
tions. 

III. — Population. 
There are now no means of accurately ascertaining the state 
of the population in this parish at a very remote period. From 
all the information that can be gathered on the subject, it appears, 
that, for a long series of years, the population has been increasing' 
though by no means rapidly. Previous to the time at which the 
former Statistical Account was written, the number seems for 
many years to have been almost stationary, but 'since that period, 
and from the commencement of the Parliamentary census taken 
at different periods, there has been a regular increase. In the 
former Account, which was written, we believe, in the year 1793, 
the number of persons then inhabiting the parish is stated at 1 121, 
of whom 800 are stated as having been above seven years of ao-e, 
• The number now living in the parish is 1440. The chief cause, 
apparently, of the low ratio of increase may be traced to a practice 
now becoming too common throughout the country, of convert- 
ing districtsof land which have been formerly tenanted by a num- 
ber of small farmers or crofters into large farms. The tenantry 
thus ejected are obliged either to emigrate to some of the colo- 
nies, or to congregate in the villages at home. 

Language.— TiW the end of the eighteenth century, the prevail- 
ing, and, indeed, almost the only language in use, was the Gaelic. 
Since that |eriod, however, the English has been advancing ra- 
pidly ; chiefly in consequence of the schools which have been 
established in the diflferent districts of the parish, and partly from 
experienced by the Highlanders, speaking the Gaelic 
alone, in transacting business in the more southern parts of the 

o 



ALNESS. 



345 



country. Though there are still some of the older inhabitants, 
who, in consequence of their not being able to read, and from their 
having spent the greater part of their lives in the use of the Gaelic 
language exclusively, have not become acquainted with the English, 
it may be stated generally, that there is now no individual in the 
parish, under twenty years of age, who does not understand the 
more modern language in a greater or less degree. 

Character of the People. — The people of this parish cannot be 
said to differ greatly from the rest of the population of the coun- 
try. They are sober, and, upon the whole, industrious, attending 
strictly to the ordinances of religion. There is a difference, how- 
ever, very strikingly marked, between the village population and 
that of the rural and more northern districts. The character of 
the latter is decidedly the more favourable one. They still pos- 
sess many of the traits peculiar to the character of the ancient 
Highlanders, while among the former, there is scarcely a trace 
left to remind us of the race from which they spruntr. As one 
striking characteristic of the poorer classes in these rural districts, 
it may be remarked, that they have a decided reluctance to apply 
for charitable aid, either public or private. 

Smugglivg and PoacJting.— Some years ago, illicit distillation 
was carried on to 'a considerable extent, especially in the more 
Highland districts. It is now, however, totally abolished. The 
practice of salmon poaching during close season, by means of the 
spear and torch light, is also in a great measure discontinued. 

IV. — Industry. 

Half a century has now nearly elapsed since the former Statis- 
tical Account was written, and in that space of time, changes more 
or less must have taken place in all parts of the country.'' In this 
parish many important improvements have been effected. That 
a great change for the better has taken place in the method of 
cultivating the soil, is sufficiently attested by the fact, that, within 
the period alluded to, it has more than doubled its value. This 
is to be attributed, partly, perhaps, to an improvement in the im- 
plements of husbandry, but principally, we believe, to a better 
and more regular alternation of cropping, to the use of lime, be- 
fore unknown, and to the more general introduction of drainage. 

A change no less marked has also been effected in the means of 
communication throughout the parish ; for where not many years 
ago, there existed only imperfect tracts, impassable in winter, "from, 
their formmg the channel to some mountain torrent, and almost 

ROSS AND CROMARTY. y 



346 



ROSS AND CROMAllTY. 



equally so in summer from the stones left by the winter stream, 
there are now to be found excellent roads, affording an easy pas- 
sage to any species of conveyance. 

The general aspect of the parish has also been greatly im- 
proved, by the cultivation of large tracts of land, and by the plan- 
tation of an immense quantity of wood, principally of the larch 
and Scotch fir species, which are already covering the sides of the 
hills, formerly bleak and rugged, with thick masses of evergreen. 

Plantations. — On the estate of Novar, since the property came 
into the hands of the present proprietor, four million and a half of 
trees have been planted. They are chiefly of the larch and Scotch 
fir species, but comprehend also a number of kinds of forest and 
ornamental wood. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no entire village in this parish. The village of Alness 
is divided nearly equally between this and the neighbouring pa- 
rish of Rosskeen, by the river of the same name, which forms the 
eastern boundary of Alness. In that part of this village which 
belongs to Rosskeen, a market is held monthly, principally for the 
purpose of disposing of cattle. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situated in the southern ex- 
tremity of the parish, being only about a mife distant from the 
shores of the Frith. It thus apparently occupies a situation in- 
convenient for the people, the parish stretching to a great distance 
northward. The individuals who chose the present site were, 
however, justified in so far, in placing it in the district in which it 
stands, as it is by far the most populous one in the parish- The 
present place of worship was built in the year 1780 ; but having 
been repaired at three different periods since then, it is still in pret- 
ty good condition, and is seated for about 800. All the people of 
the parish belong to the Established Church, and are, with scarcely 
a single exception, regular in their attendance on public worship. 
The number of communicants belonging to the parish is about 
80. 

Education. — There are, altogether, four schools within the 
bounds of this parish, which, for the educational wants of a popu- 
lation of little more than 1400, may be considered a very ample 
provision. The principal school is the parochial one, which is 
built quite close to the church, and the teacher of which is quali- 
•fied to instruct the scholars in the higher branches of education 
eommonly taught throughout the country. The number of scholars 



ALNESS. 



347 



attending varies considerably at different periods of the year ; in 
summer, the average number is 40 ; in winter, it is upwards of 60. 
The schoolmaster's salary is the minimum, but, including school- 
fees, and the provision made for the session-clerkship, the yearly 
income may amount to L. 50. Of the other three schools alluded 
to, two are endowed, one of them being supported by the Society 
for Propagating Christian Knowledge, and the other by the Ge- 
neral Assembly's Education Committee. In both these the num- 
bers vary with the different seasons of the year. The average 
number for the whole year may, however, be stated for the for- 
mer at 35, in the latter, it amounts to 50. 

The fourth school is a female one ; it is taught in the village, 
and IS pretty well attended, but has no regular endowment.  

State of the Poor. — The poor of this parish are better provided 
for than those of most of the neighbouring parishes. So much is 
this the case, that many instances have occurred of individuals 
who are obliged to live by the charity of others,— coming to reside 
m this parish the necessary time in order to have their names added 
to the list of recipients. The number at present on the poor's 
roll is about 70. The fund for their partial support and relief 
arises principally from the weekly collections, which now amount 
yearly to the average sum of L. 50, and partly from the interest 
of small sums of money left by various individuals, which, were 
they all paid up, would amount to about L, 400. 

The circumstances of the poor have, moreover, been greatly 
ameliorated of late years, in consequence of the residence in the 
parish of Major-General Munro of Teaninich. The exertions 
of this gentleman in behalf of the poor and afflicted are indefati- 
gable. Not confining himself to mere pecuniary contributions, the 
amount of which, to men of wealth, is in general a thing of very 
little consequence, he administers to their relief by daily personal 
visits, by supplying them with medicines, distributing among them 
meal and other provisions, and by providing them with fuel during 
the rigour of the winter season. The tendency of this mode of 
bestowing charity is to excite in the minds of those benefited a 
sense of gratitude, which is unquestionably conferring a greater 
and more lasting benefit on the poorer classes, than the granting 
of pecuniary aid, to whatever amount, on the mere principle of legal 
assessment or taxation. 

Fnel—TiW of late years, peats and wood were the articles of 
fuel almost exclusively in use; but since trading by means of ves- 



348 



nOSS AND CROMARTY. 



sels in the frith has become common, considerable quantities of 
coals, both English and Scotch, have been imported, and con- 
sumed in the lower parts of the parish. The population of the 
more highland districts, having peat mosses in their immediate 
neighbourhood, still continue to employ that species of fuel.

PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER WOOD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation, Boundaries, Sfc. — The parish of Rosemarkie lies along 
the north side of the Moray Frith, bounded by the parishes of 
Resolis and Cromarty, on the north and north-east, and on the 
west, by the parish of Avoch. Its length from north-east to south- 
west is about 6 miles, and its breadth, from the coast inland, is 
on an average between 2 and 3 miles j comprehending an extent 
of 15 square miles or thereby. 

Name. — The original name of the parish was Rosmarkyn, as 
appears by the seal of the ancient burgh, and many old chartula- 
ries, and is supposed to be of Gaelic etymology — composed of 
Ros, signifying a promontory or headland, and maraichin, seamen. 

Topographical Appearances. — The situation of the parish is very 
pleasant, as rising gradually from the shore to a considerable ele- 
vation, and towards the eastern extremity, the coast presents a 
particularly bold and high outline, commanding a rich and exten- 
sive view over sea and land in all directions. The more inland 
and elevated grounds, which are for the most part arable, extend 
in some places to that continued range of hilly ground, which bi- 
sects the Black Isle district of Ross-shire, stretching nearly from 
Cromarty to Beauly, called the Mulbuie — Maol-Buidhe — or yel- 
low promontory, and otherwise, Ardmeanacli, or middle ridge. 

Bays, Springs, Cascades. — There are no lakes nor rivers in the 

parish. A very beautiful bay is formed by the extensive curvature 

of the shore, sweeping from Fortrose Point towards the north and 

3 



ROSEMARKIE. 



349 



east ; near the middle of which curve Rosemarkie is situated. The 
greater part of the' shore is hned with a smooth surface of fine sand, 
affording deUghtl'ul ground for sea-bathing ; while the bay itself is 
an admirable place of anchorage and shelter for trading vessels, 
during high westerly winds. Indeed the shores on this part of the 
coast are peculiarly favourable for sea-bathing, and are frequently 
resorted to by strangers for this purpose. 

The parish is well supplied with water by means of perennial 
springs, and some small streams or burns. On the burn discharg- 
ing itself into the bay of Rosemarkie, about a mile above the town, 
there is a pretty little fall or cascade. During rainy weather it is 
considerably increased, and from its position and proximity to the 
public road, and situation towards the head of a deep ravine, it can- 
not fail to attract the notice of the traveller, as a pleasing and 
striking object. Another waterfall, of a similar description, is to 
be met with on proceeding along the shore to the east ; and at the 
extreme boundary of the parish, in the direction of Cromarty, runs 
the burn of Ethie, which, with its cascades and high precipitous 
banks, as it approaches the sea, is truly wild and picturesque. 

Soil and Climate. — The nature of the soil is various. In the 
upper parts of the parish, the lands lie generally on a deep clay 
bottom, producing abundant crops of excellent quality : of the 
lower grounds along the coast, where there is an extensive and 
beautiful flat, well cultivated, the soil is a fine black mould upon 
light gravel, which, in moderately rainy seasons, never fails to yield 
a luxuriant crop of all kinds. 

The surface being in general dry, and having the benefit of fine 
sea-breezes, the air is particularly pure and salubrious, so that few 
contagious distempers make their appearance, and when they do, 
their progress is quickly checked. The climate being thus favour- 
able, the inhabitants in general are a robust and healthy race; and 
many of them attain to extreme old age. The most prevailing 
winds are south-west and north-east; and these at times are suffi- 
ciently high and boisterous. 

Zoology. — The zoology of the parish is not distinguished by any 
of the rare species of animals. Under this head, however, the 
writer may take occasion to notice, that along its bold and rocky 
coast, crabs, and sometimes lobsters, are dragged from their fast- 
nesses, by the country people, in the proper season ; and seals are 
often seen and killed along the shores, while they are watching 
their prey. The frith abounds with fish of various kinds, such as

mh IS the old sandstone formation of geologists, which extends also 
to the whole ndge of the Mulbuie, where several quarries have been 
opened and wrought for many years past ; the material being found 
of excellent quahty for buildings of every description. The bold 
and rocky chfFs, overhangmg the sea for more than half the length 
of the parish, are composed of gneiss, traversed by veins of white 
quartz. In some parts, these cliffs rise almost perpendicularly to 
a very considerable height, and they abound in caverns, which add 
much to the wildness of the scenery; while some of them have 
frequently been occupied as temporary dwellings by people of the 
gipsy race. o j t- i- 

„, TL— Civil History. 

1 he town of Rosemarkie, though not large, is of considerable an- 
tiquity. It was erected into a royal burgh by Alexander, Kino- of 
Scotland,-probably Alexander II. About a mile to the west of it 
stands the town of Chanonry, so called from its being the Chanonry 
of Ross, where the bishop formerly had his residence, and which is 
now the Presbytery seat. It is beautifully situated on an elevated 
plain, commandmgan extensive prospect, particularly of the Moray 
h nth. It was united to the burgh of Rosemarkie by a charter granted 
by King James II., anno 1444, under the common name of For- 
tress, now softened into Fortrose ; which charter was ratified by Kin. 
James VL, anno 1592; and confirmed in a still more ample form 
by the same monarch in the year 1612. These charters bear 
that It was to be « entitled to all the privileges, liberties, and im- 
munities granted to the town of Inverness." Fortrose is then 
spoken of as a town flourishing in the arts and sciences, beino- at 
that time the seat of divinity, law, and physic in this corner of'the 
kingdom. The Bishop of Ross was originally styled Episcopus 



ROSEMAUKIE. 



351 



Rosmarkiensis, and the Cathedral church stood in the town of 
Chanonry, in a spacious square, where, together with the bishop, 
resided a number of his clergy ; so that there is scarce a house in 
the burgh but was formerly a manse belonging to some of the 
Chapter, as appears by the ancient charters and infeftments. 

The Episcopal see was founded by David I., King of Scot- 
land; but there is no certain account at what period the Cathe- 
dral was built, though it is said to have been a fine one, with a 
lofty steeple. Bishop Leslie also takes notice of the palace, which 
stood at a little distance from the houses of the canons ; and he 
represents it, in his time, as a splendid and magnificent building. 

This statement was so far confirmed a few years ago, while 
trenching the field called the " Precincts," where it was said to 
have stood, by the foundation walls being discovered considerably 
under the surface, which walls, including the court or area, were 
found to cover about an acre of ground. 

Only a small part of the ancient cathedral now remains. This 
seems to have been a wing that ran from east to west, with an 
arched roof, about 100 feet in length, and .'30 in breadth. • It had 
a communication by entries or porches with the main body of the 
cathedral. It was preserved and repaired by some of the bishops 
since the Restoration, as a place for public worship ; but it has 
long since fallen into a state of decay, and is only now used for 
the purpose of interment. 

It is highly probable that this cathedral, at the Reformation, 
had suffered the fate of many others; though it be a current tra- 
dition in the place, that the greater part of it, together with the 
Bishop's Palace, just mentioned, was pulled down in the time of 
Oliver Cromwell. By his order the stones were carried by sea to 
Inverness, about the distance of eight miles, for erecting a fort 
there, called " Cromwell's Fort," whereof the ditch and traces of 
the ramparts are still discernible. No chartulary belonging to the 
bishopric has been found in Scotland. 

It is probable that Leslie, the last Popish Bishop of Ross, and 
the zealous advocate for the unfortunate Queen Mary, when he 
was forced to go abroad, carried all the records of the diocese with 
him, either to France or to Brussels, where he died, and where 
these parchments may still be mouldering in dust and solitude. 

No inscriptions are to be found about what remains of the ca- 
thedral, worthy of notice, excepting on a large old bell, now hung 
in a small modern spire. It bears the name of Mr Thomas Tul-

of th.s venerable apostle. To perpetuate his memory we have

who, after defeating the English in many battles, and quieting 
the state of the nation, according to Buchanan, having gone 
to the north to take a view of his possessions there, died in 1338 
and was buried at Rosemarkie. 

Eminent Men. — Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, that 
eminent statesman and able lawgiver, passed a part of his time at 
Fortrose. Dr George Mackenzie, too, the laborious compiler of 
the " Lives of the most Eminent Writers of the Scottish Nation,'' 
resided here, in an old castle belonging to the Earl of Seaforth, 
and Ues interred in the tomb of that family in the Cathedral. And 
Dr James Mackenzie, who writes " the Art of preserving Health," 
is said to have been for some time employed in teaching the gram- 
mar school of the burgh. In addition to these, it may be men- 
tioned, that Sir James Mackintosh, so well known to the literary 
world, here received the elements of his education ; and even 
at that early period, his studious habits, and great proficiency, 
gave strong indications of his possessing high intellectual endow- 
ments. 

Chief Land-Oioners. — The principal proprietors are, Roderick 
Mackenzie, Esq. of Flowerburn ; James Fowler, Esq. of Raddery ; 
Evan Baillie, Esq. of Dochfour and Ethies ; Sir James W. 
Mackenzie of Scatwell, Bart.; the Rev. R. M. Millar of Kincurdie ; 
and Malcolm Maclean, Esq. of Hawkhill. There are several other 
smaller heritors, who are possessed. of burgage lands and tenements. 
Only one of the principal heritors resides in the parish, namely, 
James Fowler, Esq. of Raddery. The total valued rent of the 
parish is L. 3725, 3s. 8d. Scots money. 

Parochial Registers. — From the loss of some of the old registers, 
by accident or carelessness, and the negligence of the people in for- 
mer times, in registering the births of their children, these records 
do not extend far back, and are somewhat incomplete, previous to 
the induction of the present incumbent, in the-year 1815. Since 
then, the session records of births, marriages, deaths, and poor's 
funds, have been regularly kept. 

Antiquities. — An ancient shaft of stone, forming the Cross of 
Rosemarkie, and bearing as capital a ducal crown, stands at the 
west end of the street; another of a similar description was 
erected of old in the market-place of Chanonry or Fortrose, and 
a third of an inferior description on the Ness, where, according to 
tradition, the last witch in Scotland was burnt. Immediately above 
the town of Rosemarkie, there is a mound of nearly a circular form, 



"OSS AND CI OM ARTY. 



and level on the top, which seems to be artificial, and has always 

la e where courts were held for the administration of justice- 
Ih.s rather nteresting spot, in all likelihoo.d connected with such 
udjcal proceedings, has of late been injured in its appearance, 
by the erection upon it of some small cottages 

It was already observed that the landward part of the parish 
stretches up towards the summit of the Mulbuie, along the ride 
of which tradition supplies "tales of battles fought," to which 
cairns and tumuli, and the marks of ancient encampments bear 
ample testimony ; and one cairn in particular is distinguished bv 
he designation of the Cats-Cairn_a natural English corruption 
from Cazrn-a.chath, signifying the cairn of the battle. Under 
some of these have been found stone-coffins, and weapons of 
copper and other metals, confirming the tradition that in this 
place a gigantic Danish Chief was killed and buried. Indeed, 
fi-om Its vicinity to the coast, and particularly the inviting landing- 
place at Cromarty, it is easy to conceive this district to have been 
a scene of incessant strife between these northern rovers, and the 
tenacious Gaelic tribes of the country. 

Coins.-In 1 787, several silver coins were found in a small cairn 
of stones near Rosemarkie. They were mostly shillings oT Queen 
Elizabeth, with a mixture of other coins, and particularly some of 
the times of James I. and Charles I. It is probable they were de- 
posited there in the time of the civil war, and may have been 
brought into the country by the gallant Marquis of Montrose, or 
some of his followers. About 200 more silver coins were found 
in a copper jug of an antique form, in digging up the foundation 
of an old house at Chanonry. They were coined in the reign of 
Robert King of Scots. Small copper coins are frequently found 
in labouring the grounds about the place, and more especially in 
the gardens.

Character of the People. — The people in this parish are, gene- 
rally speaking, sober, cleanly, and industrious ; and appear in every 
respect contented with their condition, and the circumstances in 
which Divine Providence has been pleased to place them. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The parish being divided 
among a great many small as well as several principal heritors, 
the number of acres cultivated or occasionally in tillage cannot be 
satisfactorily obtained without actual admeasurement. Neither 
can the number of acres of waste and pasture land with any accu- 
racy be ascertained. It is supposed that the greater part of the 
waste ground might, by the proper application of capital, be kept 
in occasional tillage, or in permanent pasture. There are 
under planted wood about 837 acres imperial measure. The 
application of lime in husbandry, the use of bone manure in 
the raising of turnips, which are generally ate off the ground 
by sheep, and which has been found very much to improve the 
soil, with due attention to a proper rotation of crops, and rest- 
ing the fields in grass, are becoming daily more prevalent here. 
The farmers residing near the shore avail themselves of the advan- 
tage of using sea-ware as often as they can procure it ; which they 
either spread at once upon the lands, or mix in a compost, the lat- 
ter process being found to be the best mode of applying it. 
Some of the tenants keep still a few sheep of the small country 
kind, which are pastured on heath, and among whins and broom. 
Leases of nineteen years endurance are general. 

Eent of Land. — The rents of land in the country part of the pa- 
rish vary from L. 1, 10s. to L.2 per acre; the lands about the 
united burgh draw per acre from L.3 to L.4 and upwards. 

The state of farm-buildings would admit of great improvement ; 
and the subdividing and enclosing with proper fences, the different 
arable fields, hitherto greatly overlooked, would be highly de- 
sirable as well as beneficial. 

Farming Socief.7/. — A society denominated " the Black Isle 
Farming Society," consisting of the proprietors and the more re- 



356 



I103S AND CIlO.VJAin Y. 



spectable farmers in the district, was formed about two years a-o at 
lortrose, where they regularly hold two meetings in -the year the 
one for a competition of the best qualities of grain, and the other 
for an exhibition of live-stock. The members of the society con- 
tribute annually for the formation of a fund, out of which premiums 
are awarded at the said meetings, by competent judges, for the best 
samples of grain, and for superiority in the breed of cattle. The 
object farther is, to excite a spirit of emulation among the practi- 
cal farmers, who have thus an opportunity of communicating to 
each other their observations and experiments, which may be the 
means of introducing valuable improvements. 

Though large tracts of the parish were of old covered with 
wood, it has long since become exhausted. But, in later times, con- 
siderable plantations of Scotch firs have been raised, which are 
very thriving; and as the parish is but poorly supplied with moss, 
these might be a useful fund for fuel. Coals, however, are now so 
readily obtained, and at such a moderate rate, that they are found 
to be the cheapest, as well as the most agreeable fire, so as to su- 
persede, in a great degree, the use of any other article of firing. 
The fir plantations, when cut down, are generally exported to 
England as coal props. In getting these to the shipping-place 
there is every facility, with a commodious harbour at Fortrose for 
trading vessels of moderate size, and where, during any state of the 
weather, they are completely protected. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets. — At Fortrose, which is also the post-town, there are 
three fairs annually held, in the months of April, June, and No- 
vember. 

Means of Communication. — The public roads to the west, lead- 
mg to Inverness and Dingwall, being Parliamentary, are kept in 
excellent repair, — those towards Cromarty and Invergorden are old 
district roads, badly planned at first, and generally in such a state 
as to render travelling in these directions extremely difficult and 
uncomfortable. No mail or stage-coach passes through the pa- 
rish. The steam-vessels plying in the Frith, and passing weekly, 
take in and deliver a Chanonry Point goods of every description. 
These vessels are well fitted up for passengers, and they trade with 
Aberdeen, Leith, and London. By them the salmon taken here, 
and brought and collected from various stations around, are, when 
packed in ice, shipped for the London market, — as also in the sea- 
son, considerable quantities of pork and live pigs.

Ecclesiastical State. — We have already stated the traditional ac- 
count of the origin of the parish church in the ancient town of 
Rosenicirkie, as having been founded by St Boniface. On the 
same site where the church had stood for centuries, was erected 
eighteen years ago a handsome modern edifice. It is large and 
commodious, having been built for at least 800 sitters, affording 
ample church accommodation for the parishioners; in which respect 
not many parishes are so well provided. With few exceptions the 
bulk of the more remote parishioners in the country part, may be 
said to be within three miles of the church. 

The present manse was built in 1833, in the same situation as 
the former, near to the line of road leading from Rosemarkie to 
Fortrose, and at a convenient distance from the church. It com- 
mands a fine extensive prospect of the Moray Frith, and the ad- 
jacent country. The office-houses were also rebuilt some years 
previous; and both these and the manse are finished in a substan- 
tial manner, and afford every necessary comfort and convenience. 

The glebe consists of about four Scots acres. The stipend is 
16 chalders, half meal and half barley, payable according to the 
highest fiars in the county ; with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. The last augmeniation was granted in 1816. 

Besides the parish church, the only other place of public wor- 
ship is an Episcopal chapel, some time since erected in Fortrose, 
standing a mile distant from Rosemarkie. It is a modern, conve- 
nient, and handsome structure of Gothic architecture, and can ac- 
commodate, as presently fitted up, about 300 sitters. The con- 
gregation now assembling there is very limited, there being but few 
families or individuals of the Episcopal persuasion in the place or 
neighbourhood. 

The number of families connected with the Established Church 
is 337 ; of Dissenting or Seceding families, 21, — in several of 
which, however, only the heads of the families are Dissenters, 
while the remaining members attend the Established Church. 

It may be proper here to notice, that it is in contemplation to 
erect, so soon as sufficient funds can be procured by public sub- 
scription, a church, quoad sacra, in Fortrose. With the concur- 
rence of the presbytery of the bounds, a constitution for the same 
has been prepared, and submitted to the Church Courts, and has 
received the sanction of the General Assembly. 

The salary or stipend for the support of the minister is intend- 
ed to be paid out of the annual produce of a fund mortified by a

llOSS AND CROMARTY. 



Mr Thomas Forbes, once a bailie in Fortrose ; and under the ad- 
ministration of the ministers of the parishes of Rosemarkie and 
Avoch ; which fund has now amounted to a sum considered suffi- 
cient for accomphshing the ulterior object contemplated by the 
donor. 

Education. — There are various schools in the parish, but none 
of them strictly parochial. 'J'his arises from the parish school sa- 
lary having been at one time conjoined with the grammar or burgh 
school at Fortrose, and afterwards with the academy there ; but 
since withdrawn from both; and application has been recently made 
to the presbytery to adopt the proper measures for the establish- 
ment of said school. In the meantime, there are at Rosemarkie 
two schools without salary, where the usual elementary branches 
are taught, and which are well attended ; one of these is an infant 
school, at which from 30 to 40 children are instructed. 

At Fortrose there exists what is denominated the burgh or 
grammar school, and a female school for young ladies, supported 
chiefly by subscription. 

The academy of Fortrose was the first seminary of the kind esta- 
blished in the north, and is supported out of a fund formed by do- 
nations and subscriptions. In it are taught all the branches usual- 
ly embraced by such institutions, under the superintendence and in- 
structions of the rector and his assistant. Donors of L. 50 and 
their male representatives become perpetual directors. Those of 
L.21 are directors for life. The many young men this establish- 
ment has sent into the world, who are now filling various respec- 
table situations in life, bear sufficient testimony to its character 
and usefulness for nearly half a century past. 

There are three Sabbath evening schools in the parish, all of 
them well attended ; and which are found to be productive of much 
benefit to the rising generation. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is about 86. In this number, however, are 
included a good many, who, though able to work for themselves, 
receive small annual supplies, especially when they are known to 
have young families. Few or none of them travel about to seek 
charity in other parishes. There is a strong disposition on the part 
of the poor to refrain from asking parochial relief ; but this feeling 
appears to die away soon after they get on the roll. The fund for 
their support arises from the weekly church collections, which may 
amount throughout the year to about L. 17; and the interest of a 



ROSEMARKIE. 



359 



small capital of above L. 200, on which capital the kirk-session 
have always felt a reluctance to encroach, though the pressing cir- 
cumstances of the poor seemed frequently to call for it. Besides 
the above, there are two mortifications for the poor of Chanonry; 
the one by Barbara Mackenzie, Countess of Seaforth, anno 1680, 
of 17 bolls 2 firlots land rent, under the administration of the mi- 
nisters of Rosemarkie and Avoch ; and the other of 27 bolls, from 
some lands disponed by Bishop Paterson, and other lands pur- 
chased with money mortified by Sir Alexander M'Kenzie of Coul ; 
whereof the magistrates are administrators. John Fowler, Esq. a 
native of this place, who died in Jamaica, also bequeathed the sum 
of L. 100 to the poor of Fortrose. 

Friendly Society. — There is a society in the united royal burgh, 
termed " the Fortrose and Rosemarkie Friendly Society," esta- 
blished in January 1831, which promises fair to be of benefit to the 
poorer classes of labourers and mechanics therewith connected. 

Inns. — At Fortrose there is a good inn, and both there and in 
Rosemarkie several smaller inns, where inferior accommodation 
may be had. But it would be highly desirable that the number of 
low tippling-houses should be more limited. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The appearance of the people, as respects their manners, dress, 
and habits of industry, shews, that in these, of late years, there has 
been a great advance. The improvements in agriculture since the 
time of the former Statistical Account, have been very considerable, 
and are daily on the increase. The taste for reading in various depart- 
ments has pervaded all classes of society; so much so, indeed, that 
among tradesmen and the labouring classes, many valuable works 
are now to be met with, particularly of a religious character, 
where in former times such publications were seldom looked for, 
and but rarely found. There can be no doubt that the bulk of the 
people in the towns would be inclined to industrious habits. But 
for want of regular employment, in the absence of manufactories 
of any sort, they are not so well provided for, as where advantages 
of this description are enjoyed.

PRESBYTEllY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. HUGH ROSS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish is the Gaelic word Fearnn, 
signifying the alder tree, — there being many of these trees grow- 
ing at Mid-fearn, in the parish of Eddertown, in this neighbour- 
hood, where the foundation of the abbacy was in the twelfth cen- 
tury first laid. But the churchmen in those days finding the lands 
there confined, and not so fertile as they would have wished, got 
a new bull from the Pope, for building the abbacy where it now 
stands, in a fertile and extensive plain of good land. It was found- 
ed here by Farquhard, or Farquhar, first Earl of Ross, in the 
reiffn of Alexander II. 

Extent, — The parish is of no great extent, being only 2 
English miles in length, and nearly of the same breadth. It is 
bounded on the south, by the parish of Nigg; on the west, by 
Loggie Easter; on the north, by Tain; and on the east and 
south-east, by Tarbat and the Murray Frith. 

The soil is a deep loam, in the centre of the parish, about the 
abbacy church. The loans of Fearn to the south, and the lands 
of Allan to the west, are a deep clay ; the north and east part is 
gravellish ; the south-east and south is light and sandy. The face 
of the parish is nearly flat, with the exception of a few eminences, 
that are generally laboured. About three-fourths are arable, the 
rest partly green, and partly covered with heath. 

The loch of Eye is above two miles long, and about half a mile 
broad. The Murray Frith lies to the south-east of this parish. 
The coast for about a mile is flat and sandy, on which the fishing 
town of Balintore lies, and Hiltown, another fishing town about 
half a mile to the east of it; there, it is rocky and high for about 
a mile more.

Antiquities. — " There are several Druidical temples in this pa- 
rish. The abbacy is one of the most ancient buildings here. It 
is said to have been first made up of mud. It was not only a place 
of worship before the Reformation, but ever since, until October 
1742, when, on a sudden, in time of public worship, the roof fell 
in. There were thirty-six persons killed instantly, by what fell in 
of the roof and slate, on that melancholy occasion; eight more 
died soon after. — The Castle of Lochlin, in the north-east cor- 
ner of the parish, is another remarkable building. It is said to be 
of 500 years standing. It stands upon an eminence, about one 
mile north-east of the loch of Eye, and about six miles east from 
Tain, and is indeed one of the most conspicuous objects in this 
country. It was certainly built as a place of security against sud- 
den incursions in the days of violence. Its shape resembles two 
figures, nearly square, joined together by the corners, in which 
junction there is a staircase to the top. The lesser one, which 
looks towards the west, being about 20, and the greater, which 
looks towards the east, about 38 feet square. The castle is 60 
feet high. It is fortified with three large turrets, of which one 
stands upon the lesser square, and two upon the greater. These 
turrets are each of them capable of holding three or more men 
with ease, and in each of them are five small round holes, of about 
four inches diameter, with three larger above them, of a quadran- 
gular form. The latter, it is imagined, were intended for the sen- 
tries or watchmen to see through, and the others for shooting of 
arrows. The outer door of the kitchen was made of strong bars 
of iron, as thick as an ordinary man's leg, and the windows were 
closed with small grates or twisted stanchions of iron, so that it may 
be readily supposed that it was almost impregnable at the period 
in which it was erected. — There is another very ancient castle, 
that of Cadboll, equally old, if not older than either the abbacy 
or the Castle of Lochlin. There are little remains of it now, but

two or three vaults. There is a very singular and remarkable tra- 
dition concerning this castle, that, though it was inhabited for ages, 
yet never any person died in it; and many of those who lived in 
it, wished to be brought out of it, as they longed for death, espe- 
cially Lady May, who resided there about one hundred years ago; 
being long sick, and longing for death, she desired to be brought 
out of her castle, which at last was accordingly done, and no soon- 
er did she come out of it, than she expired " — Old Statistical Ac-

UNITED PARISHES OF 
<name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7901103">URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTER</name>.</head> 
<p>
PRESBYTERy OF DINGWALL, SYNOB OF ROSS.  

THE REV. JOHN MACDONALD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish, now known by the name of Urquhart, is 
in all church records designated the united parishes of Urquhart 
and Loggie Wester; the former, comprehending the eastern, and 
the latter, the western district of the parish as now constituted. 
As the designation intimates, it was originally two distinct pa- 
rishes ; but at what period the union took place has not been as- 
certained. It seems, however, probable, from a reference made to 
the parishes in an old manuscript in the Advocates' Library, that 
they had been incorporated as early as the year 1490, it being 
therein stated that one Mr Munro was, at that time, vicar of Ur- 
quhart and Loggie- Wester. 

In regard to the designation Urquhart, — it derives its origin, ac- 
cording to a tradition still current in the place, from the first 
church, on the erection of the parish, having been built by a lady 
of eminent piety, by name Sophia Urquhart, in Gaelic, Sitheag 

 Drawn up hy D. Mackenzie, A. M., and revised by the Rev. J. Macdonald, Mi- 
nister of the parish.

Urachdun. This tradition is noticed by the writer of the former 
Statistical Account, who adds, that the lady was of the family of 
Cromarty, whose landed property in this country was anciently of 
vast extent, and that to the lady referred to, the lands of Ur- 
quhart had been allotted as her dowry. He likewise observes, that 
although these lands have long since passed into a difTerent line of 
proprietors, yet still many of the inhabitants of this, and some of 
the heritors of the adjacent parishes, are of the name of Ur- 
quhart. These circumstances, taken together, serve, it is conceiv- 
ed, to render this account of the origin of the name extremely 
probable. 

Perhaps it may not be out of place to observe here, that the same 
tradition also bears that the parish of Urquhart, in Inverness-shire, 
derives its name, in like manner, from the person who first endow- 
ed it, called Crostan-Urquhart. The 'designation is, in Gaelic, 
" Urachdun mu  md  Chrostan" Anglice Urquhart, the be- 
nefit of, or endowed by, Crostan ; the adjunct, ma' Chrostan, being 
intended to distinguish it from other parishes of the name of Ur- 
quhart, of which there are, at least, two more in the north of Scot- 
land. 

Loggie, the name of the other parish, is a Gaelic word {Lag- 
gie, from lag, signifying a hollow, and is descriptive of the situa- 
tion of the old church of that parish, the ruins of which are still 
to be seen in a pleasant valley on the south bank of the river 
Conan ; the grounds contiguous to it receding and rising by a 
gentle acclivity, while the lands on the opposite side of the water 
present a bolder ascent, extending to the foot of the precipitous 
Brahan rock. It is called Loggie Wester, to distinguish it from 
another parish of the name of Loggie, within the bounds of the 
synod. 

Extent and Boundaries. — The length of the parish is about 10 
miles, its breadth, 3i. The form is a pretty exact rectangle ; and 
it lies in a direction nearly south-west and north-east. On the 
east, it is bounded by the parish of Resolis; on the south and 
south-west, by the parishes of Knockbain and Killearnan ; on the 
■west, by the parish of Urray ; on the north, the boundary is form- 
ed by the Cromarty Frith and River Conan, which separate it 
from the parishes of Kiltearn, Dingwall, Fodderty, and part of 
Urray. 

■ Topographical Appearances. — From the shore and the bank of 
the Conan, the ground rises with a gradual and pretty uniform 



URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTEIt. 



365 



slope, to the ridge of hill called the Maolbuie. The surface is 
nearly regular, there being nothing to diversify it, beyond here 
and there a knoll or a hollow. There is no elevation that deserves 
the name of hill, or depression that can be called a valley. In 
short, to an observer situated on the north of the Frith, this pa- 
rish presents the appearance of an inclined plane, having the east 
end somewhat more elevated than tlie west. The lower grounds 
are almost entirely brought into cultivation ; those parts which the 
plough has not yet reached are rapidly diminishing in extent, and 
are generally covered with furze or whin, and broom. But towards 
the Maolbuie, the uncultivated ground produces nothing better 
than stunted heath ; and in that part of the parish which adjoins 
Killearnan, there is a moss of some extent, supplying the inhabi- 
tants with a spongy kind of peat, which is used for fuel. 

Of natural scenery, a surface so uniform can scarcely be ex- 
pected to present much. With the exception of one or two burns 
or ravines of rather a romantic character, there is nothing in the 
parish that merits any notice. One of these, the Findon-burn, 
has a fine cascade of about 20 feet, which, pouring its waters into a 
yawning gorge, formed by a sudden widening of the fissure on each- 
side, the banks above rising boldly, and being covered with oak, 
birch, and hazel, there is nothing wanting to complete the interest 
of the scene, but a sufficient body of water. This gloomy chasm 
was, in the olden times, fully believed by the common people, to 
be the abode of some ideal being, called in Gaelic a Bhanbh, or 
a Bhean Shith. To what class of animals this same Baohh belongs, 
naturalists have not, it is supposed, yet been able to decide. That 
she for a female she was understood to be exercised no slight 
influence over the fears of the superstitious Highlanders, till a 
period not very remote, is well known. Her reign, however, in this 
part of the country terminated long ago, the last of the race who 
figured in the history of this parish having not been heard of for 
100 years. Of this lady a marvellous story used to be related by 
the old people, who have now gone to the silence of the grave. 
They fully believed that she held intercourse with a man whose ' 
name and residence were specified, and that he was repeatedly ab- 
sent months from his own family, being on those occasions in the 
company of his Dulcinea, the Baohh. But happily such silly ideas 
have vanished before the enlightening influence of Christian edu- 
cation. 

But although this parish cannot boast of much sceaei within 



UOSS AND CKOMARTY, 



Itself, yet it commands an excellent view of one of the most beau- 
tiful and magnificent landscapes in the north. Take your stand 
on almost any spot in the parish, look towards the north, and a 
delightful scene every where meets the eye  Jn the foreground, 
the Frith presents itself, with a number of ships lying on the beach 
at various points, or perhaps here and there a sloop sailing down 
with spread canvas, or beating up against the wind. At its ter- 
mination, it receives the waters of the Conan. Directly opposite 
the middle of the parish, lies the town of Dingwall, surrounded by 
rows of trees, and finely situated on a rich carse, formed by the 
abrupt contracting of the Frith to about half its breadth. ' As- 
cending rapidly from the edge of the water, a beautiful slope, all 
the way from Brahan, extends to the east as far as the eye can 
reach, in the highest state of cultivation, adorned with hedges, 
rows of trees, and clumps of wood— interspersed with .neat farm- 
houses, and the splendid mansions of gentlemen. Amono- these 
latter may be enumerated, Brahan Castle, Tulloch Castle, 
Mountgerald House, the princely castle of Fowlis, and Novar 
House. From the eastern parts of the parish, the celebrated vale 
of Strathpeffer, lying north-west, beyond Dingwall, is seen to great 
advantage. On a fine summer evening, when the sun shoots his 
slanting rays through the masses of mist which roll along the 
bosom of Ben Wyvis, or through the fleecy clouds that float" over 
Strathpeffer and Dingwall, down on the still waters of the Frith, 
especially when there happens to be a drizzling rain, the scene, as 
viewed from this side, is highly enchanting. The blaze of the 
light reflected from the water ; the variety of rich tints produced 
by the refraction of the rays in their passage through the clouds ; 
from the softest green to the most brilliant red, conspire to form 
a picture exquisitely beautiful, and gorgeous beyond description. 
In the distance, again, rises to the horizon a range of hills piled on 
one another, extending in the form of a crescent for about twenty- 
five miles, commencing with the hills of Urray on the west, and 
terminating in the hills of Ardross on the east. In the centre of 
this chain, sits in majesty Ben Wyvis, often either capped with 
snow, or enveloped in mist, and erecting its lofty front, as if looking 
down with contempt on every pretender to elevation around it. 

" Veruin hsec tantiim alias inter caput extiilit urbes, 
Quantum Jenta solunt inter viburna cuprnssi." 

Hydrography. — It has already been observed, that the north of 
the parish is in part bounded by the Cromarty Friih, which cx- 



URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTER. 



307 



tends alon it for a about six miles and a-half, terminating about 
a mile to the west of Dingwall. Its breadth at the east end of the 
parish may be about two miles ; towards its extremity, it is less 
than a mile broad. At Dingwall it suddenly contracts by about 
a mile. The average depth, in the middle, may be stated 
at two or three fathoms ; but towards the shore it is very shallow. 
The beach varies, being in some parts sandy, and in others clayey. 
Its water is muddy, and is rather brackish than salt, in conse- 
quence of being mixed with so considerable a body of fresh water 
as is discharged by the Conan. Salmon and grilse are taken in 
two yairs, on the property of Culloden, but, from whatever cause, 
in much smaller numbers than was the case forty or fifty years 
ago. The river Conan, which, as already noticed, pours its wa- 
ters into the Frith at its western extremity, rises in a small lake, 
about thirty miles north-west from its mouth. In its course it is 
augmented by the confluence of several streams, such as the Black 
River, the Meag, the Orrin, &amp;c. Its breadth near its mouth is 
about 50 yards, and its mean depth 2 feet. It abounds with 
salmon of a rich flavour, which is chiefly sent to the London 
market. — The lowest parts of the parish are exceedingly well 
supplied with springs of the finest water. The upper parts, how- 
ever, are not so well provided in that respect — the water be- 
ing inferior in quality, and in dry seasons, deficient in quantity. 
A few of the springs are slightly impregnated with iron, and are 
considered to be in some degree medicinal. 

Geology. — The only kind of rock in the parish is the old red 
sandstone formation of geologists. There are several quarries of 
good freestone, which supply the parish, and from which hewn 
work is sent to Dingwall, and to other places in the vicinity. In 
regard to the soil, there is considerable variety, being in some 
parts light and sharp ; in other parts a rich clayey loam is to be 
found; but the prevailing kind is a quick black mould — the " so- 
lum putre" of Virgil, which is very fertile. Towards the Maol- 
buie, the subsoil is a raw unpropitious gravel, or rather rough sand, 
which being covered only with a thin mossy or spongy layer, the 
land is consequently there considerably less productive. In for- 
mer days, a mischievous custom prevailed, of cutting up the sur- 
face to obtain turf, which supplied a wretched substitute for better 
fuel ; that process necessarily much impoverished the soil. It 
may be observed, in general, that in this parish the subsoil is dry 
and kindly, and that, consequently, tlTe crops are not often mate-

rially injured by changes of weather, which not unfrequently oc- 
casion much damage in many other districts. 

Zoology. — None of the rarer animals are to be fouud among us; 
and even some of the more common species, which, thirty or forty 
years ago, were to be met with in the parish, are now seldom or 
never seen. Reynard himself, who used to make depredations of 
a serious nature among the poultry, has been forced to decamp, 
not for want of provision, but for lack of secure quarters. Of 
breeds of cattle there are various kinds, but it is unnecessary to 
specify them. Rabbits, introduced some years ago, have multi- 
plied prodigiously, and cause a great deal of damage throughout 
the parish. Pheasants are found in the woods about Conan. In • 
winter, the woodcock is to be seen ; and occasionally the black- 
cock shows his rich plumage. The snipe also is to be met with ; 
partridges are numerous ; groups of plovers may be seen ; but 
the moorfowl has found it necessary to resort to higher ground. 
The heron is no stranger among us ; and the swan is sometimes 
seen sailinof in state on the Frith. 

Botany. — There is a considerable variety of plants to be found 
through the parish, especially in the woods ; but it has not been ob- 
served that there are any of the rarer sorts — such as deserve parti- 
cular notice here. The plants used for medicinal purposes are 
chiefly the foxglove  Digitalis J, both the purple and the white; the 
latter is, however, very scarce among us ; the whortleberry, f Arbu- 
tus Uva-Ursi ; the ground-ivy,  Hedera terrestris, considered 
an excellent remedy in cases of dysuria; coltsfoot, Tussilago ; 
trefoil or buckbean,  Menyanthes trifoliata . It may be proper 
to observe, that monkshood  Aconitum Napellus J, though it cannot 
be classed among the indigenous plants, has been found to have an 
excellent effect in discussing indolent tumours. It was applied in 
several cases in the form of a strong tincture, and seemed to act 
more powerfully than the ointment of the hydriodate of potass. 
The trees which are indigenous to the parish are, the oak, the ash, 
birch, quaking-ash, mountain-ash, gean, bird-cherry, holly, &amp;c. 

Plantatio7is. — There are pretty extensive plantations of fir and 
larch on the properties of Ferrintosh and Conan. On the latter, 
there is also a thriving plantation of hard-wood ; and the grounds 
about Conan House, one of the seats of Sir Francis A. Mackenzie 
of Gairloch, are beautifully ornamented with shrubberies, and rows 
of trees of various kinds. On each of the properties of Findon 
and Ferrintosh there is a \ood of natural oak, interspersed with 



URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTER. 



369 



birch, mountain-ash, hazel, bird-cherry, &amp;c. which constitute the 
chief objects of attraction in the aspect of the parish. The oak, 
however, is not allowed to attain to great size. 

II. — Civil History. 

It is believed that there exists no account of the parish either in 
print or manuscript. Neither are there any traditionary sketches 
that are deserving of notice, with the exception of one relating to 
President Forbes, and which forms an interesting episode in the 
history of the Rebellion. So far as has been observed by the writer, 
it has not been noticed- in any of the published accounts of that event- 
ful period. It has been preserved among the old people in these 
bounds, and as of its authenticity there can be no doubt, it may not 
be improper to introduce it here. 

Some time previous to the battle of Culloden, a design had been 
formed by the rebels to surprise President Forbes, Lord Loudon, 
and other friends of the Government, who were then at Culloden 
House, guarded by a party of the Ferrintosh and Culloden tenants. 
To execute this plan, a detachment was sent down with great se- 
crecy from the Aird along the water of Nairn. The officer in 
command, with a view to ensure the accomplishment of the object 
proposed, concealed his party in a wood in the vicinity of Cullo- 
den Plouse, which he intended to surround in the night, after as- 
certaining that the loyal party had not previously departed. In 
this state of things, a woman residing on the mains of Culloden, 
happened, in looking for some sheep, to go near the wood, when, to 
her great consternation, a tall Highlander, completely equipped in 
armour, suddenly presented himself before her, and in a whisper in- 
quired whether she knew the President or not. Instantly suspect- 
ing mischief, she made no reply. But the warrior, assuring her 
that he was no enemy to his Lordship, charged her, if she valued 
his life, without the least delay, to deliver into his own hand a let- 
ter which he pulled out of his sporan, and which he stated contain- 
ed intelligence of the last importance to the President. The woman, 
hastening with the letter as directed, arrived at the castle just after 
the company had taken their seats at the dinner table ; she had ac- 
cordingly great difficulty in obtaining access, but her urgency in- 
duced some of the servants in attendance to mention her earnest 
request to be admitted immediately to his Lordship. She was 
ordered in, and walking up to the head of the table, with a profound 
courtesy, delivered the letter, requesting at the same time that it 
should be forthwith read, as she had reason to believe it related to 



370 



llOSS AND CROMARTY. 



a matter of great moment to all present. The President was not 
the man to act the part of the Theban, to whom a letter, warning 
him of imminent danger, had been brought as he was sitting at a 
feast, and which, instead of reading, he put sealed under his pil- 
low, saying " in crastinum defero res severas." The sagacious pa- 
triot acted differently, and having instantly read the letter, became 
aware of the perilous situation in which he was placed, in time to 
escape with his life. For so seasonable and important informa- 
tion, he was indebted, as was said, to the gratitude of Coll Bain 

Macdonald of , who had sojne years before then, stood 

trial before the Court of Justiciary, on a capital charge, and 
had been, contrary to his own expectations, acquitted through the 
able services of the President, at that time practising as an advo- 
cate in the courts. Coll, aware of the danger that now threaten- 
ed his benefactor, repaid him his important services; enabling him, 
by conveying this timely intelligence, to escape the clutches of his 
mortal foes. In this critical situation, the President's usual pru- 
dence and promptitude did not forsake him. Orders were given 
to treat the men with ample cheer — the bagpipes were blown, and 
dancing was commenced on the lawn. Every thing betokened the 
absence of alarm, till arrangements for a speedy flight were com- 
pleted. Then the whole party darted away towards the Kessock, 
and reached the boats just in time to escape the rebels, who, hav- 
ing observed the movement from the castle, gave chase with the 
swiftness of the mountain stag. As the boats were crossing, some 
bullets whizzed past the ears of the loyalists, but happily no per- 
son received injury. The President and his friends having thus 
narrowly escaped, pursued their flight to the mountains between 
Ross and Sutherland, where they skulked for several weeks, in a 
state of most painful anxiety, enduring the inclemency of the 
weather, and reduced to the greatest extremity of hunger. The 
inhabitants of those districts, being generally in favour of Charlie, 
would afford the fugitives neither shelter nor supply of food ; nay, 
on one occasion, they actually hunted them with dogs. And but 
for the seasonable kindness of some friend of the Government, who 
with great secrecy sent them a present of a few sheep, &amp;c. they 
must have perished of famine. Intelligence of the battle of the 26th 
April, however, released them from these hardships, and was con- 
sidered a rich reward for all their privations and sufferings. So re- 
duced were the men, however, on their return to their homes, that 
their families could scarcely recognize them. A daughter of one of 



URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTER,

the F'errintosh tenants, who formed part of the President's escort on 
this occasion, still survives, and states that she remembers perfectly 
having often heard her mother declare, that the children of the fa- 
mily Hed affrighted from their father when he first presented him- 
self on his own floor after his return, so greatly was his aspect 
changed, like Nebuchadnezzar after his sojourn among the beasts 
of the field. 

Ferrintosh Privilege. — The history of this celebrated privilege 
we transcribe without alteration from the former Statistical Ac- 
count of the parish. — " The lands belonging to Mr Forbes of 
CuUoden, which go by the name of Ferrintosh, and form the cen- 
tral and largest division of the parish, possessed,, from 1690 to 
1786, an exemption from the duties of excise on spirits distilled 
from grain of their own growth. This privilege was originally 
granted to the present proprietor's great-grandfather, Duncan 
Forbes of Culloden, one of those patriots who, at the glorious pe- 
riod of the Revolution, stood up in defence of the religion and li- 
berties of their country. By opposing the disaffected, and sup- 
porting the Joyal subjects in his neighbourhood at much expense, 
he was materially instrumental in quashing a rebellion, which at 
that time threatened the north of Scotland. Going some time 
thereafter to Holland, in prosecution of the same patriotic plan, 
the Popish faction, during his absence, laid waste his estates, par- 
ticularly the barony of Ferrintosh, and destroyed extensive dis- 
tilleries, of which it was the seat at that time, and before the in- 
troduction of the Excise into Scotland. In compensation for the 
losses which he had thus sustained in the service of Government, 
the Parliament of Scotland, by an act passed in 1690, farmed to- 
him and his successors, the yearly excise of the lands of Ferrin- 
tosh, for the sum of 400 merks Scotch, subject, as explained by 
a posterior act, to a proportion of any additional duties of excise 
that might thereafter be imposed by law upon the kingdom. Thi&amp; 
privilege his successors enjoyed without interruption till the year 
1786. As a mark of public favour, it was not more honourably 
acquired at first, than it was amply merited afterwards by a con- 
tmued succession of important services in their country's cause; 
In 1715, the original granter's grantee's son, adhering to the 
principles of the Revolution, raised all the men upon his estates, 
and deeply impaired his private fortune, by keeping them in arms 
at his own expense, till that rebellion was happily quelled. The

ornament of his country, the Honourable Duncan Forbes of Cul- 
loden, President of the Court of Session, are universally known. 
At the breaking out of that Rebellion, he applied himself with 
zeal to nip it in the bud. He successively invited the chieftains 
to Culloden House, and whilst he delighted them by his con- 
versation and winning manners, he so wrought on them by his 
persuasive eloquence, that he was the happy instrument of keep- 
ing thousands from joining the Pretender's standard. His exer- 
tions at that critical conjuncture, whilst they brought his own li- 
berty, and even his life into imminent hazard, involved his family 
in a debt, double to that with which he had found it loaded, from 
his predecessor's zeal in the same cause, and amounting together 
to upwards of L. 30,000 Sterling. About two-thirds of that sum, 
and less than sixteen years' purchase of its proven increasing va- 
lue, was the allowance made by Government to the present pro- 
prietor, on their resumption of this immunity in the year 1786. 
The singularity of this privilege, and its great influence in a sta- 
tistical view, on the condition and number of the inhabitants of 
this parish, have led to this short account of its origin, and of the 
services by which it was earned." 

Eminent Characters. —The most distinguished character ever 
connected with this parish, so far as is known, was President For- 
bes ; but, in consequence of what is stated above regarding him, 
it is unnecessary to take any further notice of him at present. 

We must not under this head pass over General John Mac- 
kenzie, residing at Balevil, in this parish. He is of the family of 
Gairloch, and was born at Conan House. While very young he 
entered the army, and soon distinguished himself as an intrepid 
soldier. He had the reputation of being a kind and generous 
officer, and at the same time an exact and efficient disciplinarian. 
After serving his country in various parts of the globe, such as 
Holland, India, the Peninsula, &amp;c., he now enjoys his " otium 
cum dignitafe," on a farm which he has brought to a high state 
of improvement. 

On this head it will not be improper to enumerate the excellent 
pastors with which this parish has been favoured, in uninterrupted 
succession, since the period of the Revolution. The last Episcopa- 
lian minister, who held the charge, was a Mr Andrew Ross, said to 
have been a very pious man, and popular as a preacher. His 
successor was a Mr Alexander Fraser, who, it appears, was emi- 
nent for both -piety and talent, and was translated to Inverness- 



UllQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTER. 



373 



He was succeeded by Mr Alexander Falconer, admitted in 1729. 
In character he was like his predecessor. After him was Mr 
Donald Fraser, inducted in 1757. He has been represented as 
a man of a vigorous and comprehensive mind, and of extensive 
attainments. As a theologian he was reputed profound ; and in 
expounding the Scriptures few were considered his equals. The 
late eminent Dr Fraser of Kirkhill, known in the theological 
world by his " Key to the Prophecies, and Commentary on Isaiah," 
was a son of this clergyman. Mr Fraser died in 1773. His suc- 
cessor was Mr Charles Calder, who finished his ministry in 1812. 
Of this eminent servant of Christ, it may be said, that perhaps 
no minister ever reigned more in the hearts of his people. As a 
preacher he was solemn, earnest, and affectionate. His discourses 
were fraught with the theme of redeeming love, and were composed 
in chaste and elegant language, evincing, in a high degree, a polish- 
ed mind, and a classical taste. His ministrations were consequently 
peculiarly attractive, and were attended with abundant success. 
The heavenliness of his deportment rendered him an object of 
reverence, — while his-liberality to the poor, — his sympathy with the 
distressed, — his kindness to the young, — and the fatherly interest 
he took in the welfare of all, endeared him to his parishioners. 
His name is fragrant among the religious community of these 
bounds, and is embalmed in the memory of such of them as en- 
joyed his ministry, who still delight in repeating many a striking 
passage of his sermons, which remain as it were stereotyped on 
the tablets of their hearts. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners are, Mr Forbes of Culloden ; 
Sir James Wemyss Mackenzie of Scatwell ; and Sir Francis A. 
Mackenzie of Gairloch. 

The estate of Findon, forming the eastern portion of the parish, 
is the property of Sir James. According to a survey made in 1835, 
it consists of 4214 imperial acres, as follows : — 

A. R. P.

Wood, . - 46 0 9 

Total, 4214 3 16 
The yearly rent is L.1766, Os. 9d. Sterling. It is proper to ob- 
serve, that considerable improvements are in progress on this pro- 
perty — such as adding to the arable, enclosing farms, and laying 
out ground for planting.

The far-lamed barony of Ferrintosh, belonging to Culloden, 
forms the central district of the parish. It contains, as appears 
from a survey made in 1810, 4726 Scotch acres 5960 acres im- 
perial comprising: —

Total, 4726 3 14 

The quantity of arable is now, however, greatly increased, as 
hundreds of acres have been brought into cultivation since the sur- 
vey referred to was taken ; and it may be added that much of the 
reclaimed land is of a superior quality. Improvements on an exten- 
sive scale are rapidly advancing on this estate. The yearly rent 
is about L. 2500 Sterling. 

Of the estate of Conan, comprising the western portion of the 
parish, Sir Francis is proprietor. The extent of this property 
may be estimated at 2400 imperial acres, of which are arable 1500 
acres; in pasture, including moor, 300 acres; and in woods 600 acres. 

It is due to the worthy Baronet to state, that he is distinguished 
for zeal in agricultural improvements, as respects both the reclaim- 
ing of waste ground, and introducing the modern system of hus- 
bandry among his tenants. The annual rent is above L. 1000 



Sterling. 



Parochial Registers. — The oldest register now extant is dat- 
ed in 1715. The writer of the former account of the parish 
makes mention of one commencing in 1709; but if such ever 
existed it must have been lost, as the present incumbent never saw 
it. For the first thirty or forty years the entries seem to have been 
made very irregularly, there being intervals of years, during which 
neither baptism nor marriage was inserted ; and in the case of bap- 
tism, when recorded, the name of the father alone was registered. 
Subsequently, however, more attention was paid to this important 
matter; and for a considerable number of years back, the registers 
have been kept with great care ; baptisms and marriages being 
punctually entered. Of deaths no record is kept, — a circum- 
stance whicli requires reform.

Language. — The language generally spoken by the natives of 
the parish is Gaelic; and though English is daily spreading among 
us, and is now certainly better understood than at any former pe- 
riod ; yet it is believed that the original language of the Highlands 
has not lost ground for the last forty years. This may be easily 
accounted for, from the fact that almost all the youth are now 
taught to read the Scriptures in Gaelic as well as in English in 
the schools. The consequence is, that the Gaelic is not only 
preserved, but actually makes progress among us. 

Character of the People. — 'The cottars, who are still by far the 
more numerous class, cannot be said to enjoy in any considerable 
degree the comforts of life ; but they are in general content with 
their situation. The better sort of tenants are, however, fast ad- 
vancing in intelligence, and consequently in respectability of cha- 
racter and circumstances Since the period of the former Statis- 
tical. Account, the people have made progress in religious know- 
ledge and in moral conduct. Smuggling, which at one time was 
very prevalent, is now happily extinct, A single drop of whisky 
has not been distilled in Ferrintosh for years : What a change  But 
it is all for the advantage of the morality and circumstances of the 
inhabitants. Neither can poaching be said to prevail, though a case 
may now and then occur. 

IV. iNDUSTRy. 

The great majority of the inhabitants of the parish is employed 
in agriculture ; either as occupiers, feed-servants, or day-labourers. 
And of those who have a handicraft, the most hold also a small 
portion of land; so that there are very few who are not, occasionally 
at least, engaged in husbandry. This circumstance, it is obvious, 
renders it extremely difficult to classify the people. The extent 
of the farms varies from 20 to 150 acres, the average being about 
50. The possessions of the cottars are small ; say, at an average, 
4 acres. Of late years, the system of forming large farms out of 
several small ones has become pretty general ; and suitable en- 
couragement is given to the tenantry to build commodious dwel- 
ling-houses and offices, as well as to reclaim waste ground, and to 



376 



UOSS AND CROMARTY. 



Ultroduce the modern improvements in husbandry. Consequently 
a great change in the appearance of the parish has already been 
effected, and a greater is in rapid progress. Several comfortable 
dwelling-houses and convenient farm-steadings have started up ; 
farms have been enclosed and subdivided ; many a valuable acre 
has been brought under the plough ; a regular rotation of crops 
is now pursued] and the most approved farming implements in- 
troduced ; also lime and bone-dust are employed to a considerable 
extent to stimulate and fertilize the soil. The spirit of improve- 
ment has extended to the cottars, who, perceiving the advantages 
of the new system, readily adopted it, and not without success. 
It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the result is a great in- 
crease of produce, amounting to double what it was twenty years 
ago. As further evidence of the rapid march of improvement 
among us, it may be stated that, at the date of the former Statis- 
tical Account, there was not a single thrashing-mill within the 
bounds of the parish; now, however, there are seven, and the 
erection of several more is contemplated. 

The principal crops of grain raised are oats and barley. Wheat 
was a few years ago very generally cultivated ; but though it suc- 
ceeded in point of return and quality remarkably well, yet it was 
found that the growing of this grain considerably injured the land, 
so that it is now not so extensively sown. The soil is well adapt- 
ed to pease, beans, potatoes, and turnips. The cultivation of this 
last-mentioned root is much attended to; and it may be remarked, 
that of all the improvements introduced into this quarterj the plan 
of eating off the turnip by sheep on the field, seems the most be- 
neficial to the farmer, this process being almost in every case fol- 
lowed by splendid white crops. 

Since the possessions of the cottars are too small either to keep 
them in constant employment, or to maintain their families, num- 
bers of them generally go to some of the southern counties, after 
laying down their little crops, in quest of employment as labour- 
ers, and remain at such work as they may find till the beginning 
of winter, when they return with the proceeds of their labour, 
which go to pay the rent, and to the support of the family. This 
practice is pursued also by some of our tradesmen, such as masons 
and carpenters, who visit the large towns of the south with the 
double view of adding to their earnings, and of improving them- 
selves in their respective crafts. In consequence of the recent 
improvements in husbandry, an increased demand for labourers is 



URQUHART AND LOGGIE-WESTRTJ . 



377 



created at home, so that the number of persons who now visit the 
south in quest of employment, especially as reapers, is materially 
on the decrease. 

Leases. — The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. A few 
of what are called improving leases extend to the terp of thirty- 
one years. 

Rent of Land. — The average rate of rent for arable land is about 
L.l, 5s. per acre. 

Wages.' — Ploughmen receive from L.6 to L.6 per annum, toge- 
ther with board. Maid-servants are allowed from L. 3 to L. 4. 
Men employed as day-labourers are paid at from "Is. 3d. to Is. 6d. 
per day. Women for field-work, 6d., and in harvest they are al- 
lowed Is. When day-labourers are provided by their employers 
with board, about one-third of the usual money wages is deducted. 

There is no manufactory in the parish. The machinery of the 
south has almost entirely superseded the spinning-wheel of the in- 
dustrious matron, and the simple loom of the country weaver. 
The good old practice of manufacturing the linen and other ap- 
parel for the use of the family, which at one time formed a prin- 
cipal part of the domestic employment of the female sex, is now 
nearly forgotten. Our young people have accordingly exchanged 
the simple but comfortable woollen stuffs in which their ancestors 
attired their limbs, for the more gaudy but less substantial fabrics 
of Glasgow or Manchester. Whether any benefit accrues to their 
health from the change may be questioned. Is it improbable-that 
the substitution of their cotton for warm woollen raiment in the 
humid climate of Britain is a main cause of the prevalence of con- 
sumption in the present day  

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Towns. — There is no market-town in the parish. The 
nearest is Dingwall, distant from the central parts of the parish, 
round by Conan Bridge, about five miles. But across the frith, by 
a boat, at time of high water, and by the sands during ebb time, 
the distance is not more than two miles. Dingwall is also the 
nearest post-town ; which is obviously an inconvenience to the pa- 
rish at large, but especially to the eastern parts. 

Fairs. — At a small village called Culbokie, four fairs are held 
in the course of the year. 

Villages.- — The village of Conan Bridge, on the line of the great 
northern road, is a thriving place, with a population of upwards of 
300 souls Culbokie, already noticed, is the only other village.

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Means of Communication. — The Bridge thrown over the Conan, 
at the village called by that name, in 1810, consisting of five arches, 
is a handsome solid fabric. It is built of durable freestone, and the 
cost of erection was L. 6000 Sterling. Between it and the Beauly 
Bridge, sulsequently built, a communication is opened by an excel- 
lent turnpike road, along which the mail runs. Another road leads 
from Conan Bridge, across the Maolbine, to the Kessock, sending 
ofT a branch about half-way, in the direction of Fortrose and the fer- 
ry of Fort George. These roads -are kept in excellent repair; 
but the smaller branches which intersect the pari'h are not at all 
attended to as they ought, being often in a very insufficient state. 

The frith is not of sufficient depth, so far- up as this parish, to 
admit of the approach of vessels of considerable burden. A good 
deal of trade goes on, however, by means of sloops, which come 
into a quay erected a few years ago, at a place called Alcaig. 
They bring us coals, lime, &amp;c. ; and receive in return props for 
coal-pits, and timber of larger size for other purposes. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is a plain capacious 
house, situated near the sea-shore, as nearly as possible in the 
middle of the parish. It was built in 1795, and is in a good state 
of repair. The number of sitters intended to be accommodat- 
ed is 1200 ; but from 1 500 to 1800 persons have often been 
crammed within its walls. The manse was built in 1777, and is 
still in good condition. It underwent, of course, repairs several 
times, — the last in 1837, when a complete square of offices was 
erected, one of the best in the county. It was stated in the for- 
mer Statistical Account, that two glebes were attached to the 
church, each of which was at a considerable distance from the 
manse. To obviate this inconvenience, the present incumbent, 
soon after his admission, got both excambed for lands contiguous 
to the manse, and received in lieu of them — arable, 15 acres, and 
moor ground 18 acres. Of the latter, he has since reclaimed to 
the extent of 8 acres ; so that the arable now consists of 23 acres. 
In regard to value, it is equal to the average of the land through- 
out the parish. — The stipend, since the last augmentation in 1834, 
is 18 chalders, Linlithgow measure, half meal, half barley. 

For many years, no fewer than three catechists were employed 
in this parish by the kirk-session ; at present there is only one. To 
compensate, however, for that apparent diminution in the agency 
for communicating religious instruction, it is proper to observe, that 
several Sabbath evening schools to the number of six, have been 



UriQUHART AND LOOGIE-WESTER. 



379 



put into operation in the different districts of the parish, all of 
which are well attended, and are successful in conveying to the 
rising generation, as well as to others, much important Scripture 

knowledge. All these schools are taught without remuneration. 

There is scarcely a Dissenter in the parish. A considerable number 
of the inhabitants of the western districts of the parish were, thirty 
or forty years ago, Episcopalians ; but, of that persuasion, there 
are now very few indeed, — almost all the young people having be- 
come attached to the Established Church. The attendance upon 
divine service is very regular throughout the whole year. The 
number of communicants, at present, exceeds 150. There is a 
penny-a-week society, the average amount of whose annual con- 
tributions to the cause of religion may be stated at L. 10. It 
has been in operation for upwards of twenty years. The amount of 
church collections for religious and charitable objects may ave- 
rage, yearly, L. 20 Sterling. 

Education. — There are 3 schools in the parish, — the parochial 
school, in the centre; a school maintained by the Society in Scot- 
land for Propagating Christian Knowledge, in the east end ; and 
one, established a few years ago by Sir E. A. Mackenzie on his 
own property, in the westend; and to which, besides having provided, 
at his own expense, the whole of the requisite accommodations, he 
very laudably grants a small salary out of his own pocket, and also al- 
lows the master a good garden. All these schools, are, especially 
during the winter and spring months, well attended ; consequently, 
there are but very few, indeed, of the young people who do not 
obtain some share of education, to the extent, at least, of being 
taught to read the Scriptures in both languages. The parochial 
schoolmaster has the legal accommodations ; the salary is the 
maximum; and his fees may amount to L. 12 per annum. The 
emoluments arising to him from the office of session-clerk are from 
L. 4 to L. 5. The average attendance of scholars is about 65. 
The branches taught are, English and Gaelic reading, English 
grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, Latin, geography, and 
mathematics. The rate of fees per quarter is, for reading, 2s. ; 
reading and writing, 2s. 6d. ; arithmetic, 4s, ; Latin, 4s. ; mathe- 
matics or geography, 7s. 6d ; and for three sets of book-keeping, 
L. 1, Is. The salary of the Society schoolmaster is L. 15. In 
addition, the proprietor allows him a small portion of land. 
• Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons at present 
receiving parochial aid is 170. It is necessary to observe, that none 



380 ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

of the poor of this parish depend entirely on the session for main- 
tenance, — the most of them shewing a most laudable desire to do 
all in their power towards their own support ; and in cases of total 
inability through age or sickness, the relatives of the poor are ge- 
nerally ready to extend a helping hand to relieve their wants, and 
to prevent their becoming a burden on the parish. The funds at 
the disposal of the session, arising from church collections, rent of 
land, and interest of invested money, amounting, at an average, 
after deducting the usual burdens, to L. 55 Sterling, are distribut- 
ed annually ; of course, the allowance to each cannot be more 
than a mere trifle ; still it is in almost every case thankfully ac- 
cepted. In cases of sickness and urgent want, occasional relief is 
afforded out of the Sabbath collections, and that sometimes to 
persons not on the poor's roll. When families in indigent circum- 
stances happen to be visited with serious sicknesss, and death 
makes breaches in their numbers, the sympathy of the parishioners 
is promptly manifested in special collections for the relief of the 
distressed. 

Inns. — The only Inn in the parish is one at Conan village, on 
the great northern road, where it is quite necessary, and is very 
well kept. Of dram-shops there are 3, which might be dispensed 
with, without any inconvenience to the public, or detriment to the 
morals of the inhabitants. 

Fuel. — The fuel chiefly used by the principal tenants is coals, 
which is imported from Newcastle or Sunderland, and which can 
be obtained at the average price of 15s. per ton. A considerable 
number of the inhabitants use only a baked kind of peat, which is 
found in a moss in the upper part of the parish. With the addi- 
tion of a little fire-wood, which can be had at a very cheap price, 
this peat makes a pretty good fire ; and to coals, it is a great 
and decided improvement.

PRESBYTERY OF CHANONRY, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. JAMES GIBSON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Boundaries. — Avoch a name which in the opinion of an 
ingenious etymologist, signifies " shallow waters," is bounded on 
the east by the parish of Rosemarkie ; oil the south-east, south, and 
south-west, by the Moray Frith, and that branch of it called Mun- 
lochy Bay; on the west, by the united parishes of Kilmuir Wester 
and Suddie ; on the north-west, by the parish of Urquhart ; and on 
the north, by the united_;parishes of CuUicudden and Kirkmichael. 

Extent. — The greatest length of the parish of Avoch, in a 
straight line from the coast of the Moray Frith to the Folds of 
Auchterflow, is 4; miles ; its greatest breadth along its northern 
boundary, 3 miles. But this measurement, from the irregularity 
of its figure and boundary, would give an area much beyond the 
true one, which is only about 10 square miles. This extent 
may be strictly said to form a portion of the southern side of one 
great hill, called the Milbuy, Maol Buidh, yellow headland, which, 
although only about 500 feet high, extends from the Muir of Ord 
to the town of Cromarty, and divides the two great arms of the 
Moray Frith which wash, the one the shores of Dingwall, and the 
oih th of Beauly. 

Topographical Appearances. — Although, however, this range 
presents in appearance a regular acclivity from the sea to its sum- 
mit, there are several ridges of sandstone and conglomerate over 
the lower half of the parish, running parallel to the main range, 
which occasion an agreeable  iversity of hill and dale. 

The extent of the coast along the Moray Frith, from the Craig- 
land Burn to the Bay of Munlochy, is exactly three miles ; and 
the shore of Munlochy Bay, with which the parish bounds almost 
the whole way, on one side measures one mile and three-quarters 
more. Along the coast, from the east boundary to the village of 
Avoch, there is a steep romantic ridge of conglomerate, covered 



382 



HOSS AND JllO.VlAU'J'V, 



withAvood, and the richest and choicest collection of native plants 
And at the entrance to Munlochy Bay, there is a large mass of 
similar material, which, according to tradition, was once covered 
with stately oak timber, but which now, whatever has been the 
cause of the great change, presents no trace of such a forest, and 
indeed over two-thirds of the mass seems to be completely denud- 
ed of the soil, and presents in its curiously formed circular peaks 
and basons of bare rock,— a very apt miniature resemblance to a 
volcanic range. At these two places there are detached portions 
of rock— but otherwise, the whole shore is sandy and gravelly, 
with here and there an occasional small boulder. The upper 
portion of Munlochy Bay is formed of a deep blue clay, which, if 
reclaimed, and it might be reclaimed at no great expense, would 
form a valuable addition to the agricultural portion of the district. 

Clmmtc— The air is generally dry and healthy. There are 44 
of the inhabitants of this parish above seventy years of age. There 
are no distempers peculiar to this parish ; but it may be here 
mentioned, that in 1833, considerable havoc was made in the vil- 
lage by cholera. 

Hydrograplnj.— Uhe waters of the Moray Frith, and also of 
Munlochy Bay, which bound the southern, and part of the west- 
ern sides of the parish, are dark-coloured, but perfectly salt at 
all times of the tide. The tide recedes one-fourth of a mile op- 
posite the village of Avoch, where the breadth of the Frith is 
about three miles. As the tides come through the Pentland 
Frith, they are always raised by a westerly, and depressed by an 
easterly wind. The highest stream tides rise from sixteen to eighteen 
feet; the highest neap tides from eight to ten feet. The whole of 
the parish, with the exception of the south side of the second 
ridge, called Tourie Lum, is well supplied with excellent water 
from perennial springs. There are two on the north side of the 
village of peculiarly excellent quality, Hainuck and Charles's. But 
the one of great celebrity is Craiguck, on the estate of Bennetsfield, 
which is annually resorted to by numbers of invalids— at any rate 
by numbers who fancy themselves to be invalids,— early on the first 
Sabbath morningof May, old style, from various parts of the country. 
Previous to partaking of it, the propitiatory oblation has sometimes 
been rigidly observed— namely, of spilling a portion of the water 
upon the ground three times, and of affixing an offering of a rag, 

which is suspended upon a bramble bush that overhangs it which, 

from the traditionary antiquity of the custom, might appear to re-

fer to something before the introduction of Christianity ; at the 
same time, there seems a shade of compromise, as they do not 
forget to cross themselves. The amount of benefit, fancied or 
real, derived from the pellucid water of Craiguck, it is impossible 
to ascertain. But of this there can be no doubt, that in favourable 
weather, a morning sail or walk to that most picturesque spot, 
must prove essentially conducive to the health of many an invalid, 
whether the disease be real or imaginary. — The Burn of Avoch, 
which rises principally in this parish, and proves so essentially 
serviceable to four mills — one wool-carding mill, and three corn- 
mills, — after winding beautifully through the estates of Rosehaugh 
and Avoch, discharges its waters into the frith at Henrietta Bridge, 
close to the village. Near to the source is a beautiful pool, cal- 
led Littlemilstick, celebrated as the pool in which, in times past. 
Baptists were immersed. The last immersion was that of a young 
woman, from the parish of Rosemarkie, nearly twenty years ago. 
The only piece of fresh water is Scadden's Loch, which covers 
fourteen imperial acres. 

Geology. — The great peninsula of Ardmeanach, or the Black 
Isle, contained between the Moray and Cromarty Friths, consists 
mainly of a succession of sandstone ridges falling from the high 
sandstone hills, which are abutted in huge conglomerated masses 
on the primitive slates of Ord, Fairburn, and Coul, in the parishes 
of Urray and Contin. None of these ridges seem to be prolon- 
gations of the magnificent cliffs of Brahan, which, however, with 
the neighbouring masses to the south and west of them, undoubt- 
edly belong to the old red sandstone formation. 

To the east and north of the. village of Avoch, a high granitic 
ridge has been upheaved from below the sandstone strata, dis- 
turbing and throwing their beds irregularly in every possible di- 
rection, but which has not to a great extent, or in many places, 
except along the coast, overtopped them. We shall afterwards 
describe the granitic rock, with its associate beds, directing our 
attention, in the first place, to the sandstone ridges, as to which it 
may be remarked, that an examination of them collectively, as 
extending over the whole district of the Black Isle, will prove 
more satisfactory, and save repetition, than if they were noticed 
in detail in the Statistical Account of each parish. 

Commencing, then, with the coast line at Avoch, and proceed- 
ing westward and across the district to the shores of the Cromarty 
Frith, the sandstone ridges are disposed in the following order, 



' ROSS AND GHOMAUTY. 

having extensive plains between them, more or less open, some- 
times inclmed, and sometimes flat or undulating. 

Ut Ridge, Orniondy Hill, or the Lkdy's Hill of Avoch, and 
eastleton Hdl, continued on the south side of Munlochy Bay, 
by the hills of Craigiehow, Pitlundy, and the Ord of Kessock, 
where the ridge is interrupted by the sea, but is prolonged on the 
opposite shore by Craigphadrick and Dunain Hill, to the sides of 
the primitive mountains on Loch Ness. 

The rocks throughout the course of this ridge are simply either 
hard red sandstone, or coarse granitic conglomerate, composed of 
fragments, more or less rounded, of primitive rocks, either imme- 
diately cohering together, or united by a gritty cement, with no 
alternating argillaceous or calcareous beds. The formation, there- 
fore, may be decidedly pronounced as that of the old red sand- 
stone. 

2d Ridge. Hill from which the stones for the garrison of 
Fort George were quarried, on the Bennetsfield estate, prolonged 
from the southern shore of Munlochy Bay, by the ridge of Drum- 
derfit and Knockbain, to Lettoch, Coul, and Redcastle, on Loch 
Beauly. 

This ridge most probably is of the same formation as the first 
or exterior one, its superior beds, however, passing into, and form- 
mg part of the next, or 

3d Ridge. Proceeding at first in a direction rather transverse 
to the former two, by Avoch House and Rosehaugh, this ridge 
afterwards assumes a course more parallel to them, as it proceeds 
past Suddy, AUanbank, Allangrange, and Arperpheilly, to the 
heights behind Redcastle, where it sinks rapidly, and on the 
estate of Tarradale is covered by the gravelly accumulations of 
Muir of Ord. 

4th Ridge. The great central range of the ancient commonty 
called Milbuy, which 'overlooks all the other ridges, its ele- 
vation being 500 feet above the sea, and . whose sides, sloping 
up to It as the great back-bone of the district, are shortest and 
steepest toward the north, but broader and more gentle in their 
southern inclination. Behind Belmaduthy House, this ridge at- 
tains its greatest altitude, but it thence proceeds with no interrup- 
tions or breaks in its outline, and generally of a pretty equal 
height, both towards Cromarty on the east, and by Tore, Kilcoy 
Castle, and Ryefield on the west, to the valley which is watered 
by the rivers Orrin and Conon, which separate it from the sloping 



AVOCH. 



385 



fields and rocky frontlets of Brahan. On the north, the Milbuy 
range subsides by several parallel but lower sandstone ridges, ia- 
to the Dingwall or Cromarty Frith, and on the south it is sepa- 
rated from the third ridge above described, by the moss of Auch- 
terflow, the cultivated grounds below Belmaduthy, and the flat or 
boggy land which separates the property of Tore from that of 
Redcastle. 

The structure of the third and fourth ridges may now be consi- 
dered together, and although between them and the first and second 
ridges above-mentioned, we have discovered no beds of the true 
mountain limestone of the coal measures, nor yet of the bitumi- 
nous shales of Ferrindonald and Strathpeffer, which seem to re- 
present them, yet we have little hesitation in assigning the geolo- 
gical place of these two ridges to the new red or variegated sandstone 
formation. Mr Miller's recent fossil discoveries at Cromarty may, 
however, perhaps determine these ridges to be the upper beds of the 
old ied sandstone deposit. Their strata are softer and finer in tex- 
ture than those of the old red sandstone ridges. They have much 
fewer imbedded masses of conglomerate; they are more argillaceous, 
and abound in steatite and chlorite or green earth. No organic re- 
mains have as yet been seen in these strata, but in very many places 
they present the striped or variegated aspect whence the formation 
has acquired its name ; some of the quarries, as on the estate of 
Rosehaugh and Suddy, exhibiting layers of alternate yellow, 
brown, and red colours, disposed in parallel streaks or ribbons. 
Several of the superior beds are also entirely yellow, or of a dusky 
white colour, whence it is suspected that they might perhaps be 
the outgoings in this direction of some of the oolitic deposits, which 
at one time seem to have been extensively spread around the shores 
of the adjoining frith. The unusual fertility and deepness of soil, 
however, on these ridges prevent the rocks from being frequently 
seen ; and the prolific nature of the materials into which they are 
decomposed, hence affords a farther indication of their belonging 
to the new red sandstone series, which abounds more largely with 
unctuous and clayish substances than such as occur in the older 
sandstone deposit. 

As already stated, the sandstone ridges now enumerated have 
been affected at their eastern termination by a great granitic erup- 
tion or ridge which first appears in the cliffs of the Craigwood be- 
tween Avoch and Fortrose, behind which it is covered with sand- 

• These beds usually intervene between the old luid new red sandstone formations.

stone and gravel-banks, but the granite reappears on the north 
sjde of the burn of Rosemarkie, and thence composes several of 
the hills and chils along the coast, till, at the Sutors of Cromarty 
It IS found completely disencumbered of the secondary deposits' 
The rock, especially at its western boundary, consists"' chiefly of 
a hard, small granular and flesh-coloured granite, through which 
are mterspersed in minute grains and coatings, crystals°of black 
iron ore and lead glance. Numerous and large masses of gneiss 
also occur intermixed with beds of hornblende, actvnolite slate 
and quartz rock, among which garnets are extensively disseminat- 
ed ; while the whole are everywhere charged with granite veins. 
The intrusion of such granitic invasion among the sandstone strata 
could not fail to have greatly affected them, and accordingly, on 
the estates of Avoch and Rosehaugh, the ridge of which seems fo 
have been over a centre of volcanic action, we find the soft new 
red sandstone upheaved into short perpendicular hardened masses, 
the alteration and dislocation of the previously horizontal strata 
being seen to extend from the base to the very summit and crest 
of the ridge. On the opposite sides of the hill, the strata are seen 
thrown off in opposite directions, and even in the plains of Suddy 
the layers of the red sandstone are so irregularly disposed, and 
so often broken and disturbed, that it would be as useless as te- 
dious to attempt to lay down with any degree of precision, the bear- 
ings or dip of the rocks. This confusion is worthy of notice, only 
as demonstrative of the greatness and extent of the granitic influ- 
ence. That rock itself, with its various beds, falls to be more mi- 
nutely described in the reports of the parishes of Rosemarkie and 
Cromarty. It is proper to add, however, that the great elevation 
of the Milbuy sandstones has been most probably occasioned by 
the same subterranean action, although we have not as yet seen 
the granitic rock cropping out on the surface; and in this view, it 
IS likely that the basin of the Cromarty Frith was formed on the 
upheaving of the sandstone ridges along its sides, and that, before 
the invasion of the sea from between the Sutors, it consisted of a 
series of inland lakes or hollows. 

Gravel.—The whole of the parish of Avoch is, like the neigh- 
bouring districts, strewn over with great beds of sand and gravel, 
transported from a distance, as well as resulting from the decom- 
posed materials of its own rocks. In the eastern part of the pa- 
rish, towards Raddery, the gravel beds increase in extent and 
thickness, and on descending the course of the burn of Rosemar- 
kie, which is situated nearly along the junction of the sandstone 



AVOCH. 



387 



and granitic masses, we find that hollow to have been a very ancient 
one, for it appears to have been partially filled with a vast accumu- 
lation of fine sand and communicated gravel, enclosing boulder- 
stones of various sizes, disposed in layers, not horizontal, but in- 
clined towards the centre of the valley. Streams from the adjoin- 
ing hills have since greatly cut up these gravel beds, which, from 
their great depth, present most fantastic forms, many of ihe banks 
being cut into large cones, both acute and truncated, while others 
present sharp ridges, leading up to battlemented impending masses, 
perched like old castles over the deep and winding moats which 
encompass their bases. Some of these gravel beds are, at least, 250 
feet high, and exhibit bare sections most instructive to the geologist. 

Zoology. — In the burn of Avoch, the common trout and eel are 
to be found ; and in the Frith, opposite to Avoch, oysters, cud- 
dies, flounders, and occasionally small herrings, are caught. When 
the small herrings appear, cod generally abounds. Halibut is also 
to be found in the Frith. There are two salmon-fisheries, one on 
the estate of Avoch, the other on the estate of Rosehaugh. In 
Munlochy Bay, mussels are to be found in great profusion. This 
bay is much frequented during winter by swans, the great northern 
diver, and an immense variety of ducks.

tensive flora as that of Avoch. But it will be sufficient to give the

Tlie exposure of the Craigwood, like that of all the cliffs along 
the coast down to the Sutors of Cromarty, and the clayish qualities 
of its decomposing granites, render it extremely prolific in native 
herbaceous plants. In no part of the Highlands are more luxuri- 
ant festoons to be seen of Vicia syhatica, or larger and more showy 
specimens of Geranium sylvaticum, and G. sanguineum, and SaxL 
fraga granuluta. The roses which make such a show in the same 
neighbourhood, and which caused the celebrated courtier. Sir 
George;,Mackenzie, to style his property « Rosehaugh," are of 
the species Rosa canina and R. spinosissima. 

In the above list there will be found several rare plants, and one, 
Pinguicula alpina, recently discovered here in great abundance, 
and not yet found in any other part of Britain. As this discovery 
excited at the time and since, considerable interest in the botani- 
cal circles, and as the particulars of it are variously detailed in se- 
veral publications, it may be interesting to give the following ac- 
count which the writer has received from Campbell Smith, Esq. 
land-surveyor. 

In June 1831, while Mr Smith was engaged in the survey of Sir 
James W. Mackenzie of Scatwell's estate of Rosehaugh, he invited 
his friend, the Rev. G. Gordon of Birnie, to visit him, and make 
a botanical examination of the neighbourhood. Upon Mr Gor- 
don's arrival, Mr Smith presented him with a number of plants 
which he had collected for his examination, he himself having 
only commenced the study lof the science with one of these, viz. 
the new Pinguicula. Mr Gordon was delighted, and next day 
proceeded to the ground to gather fresh specimens of what he had 
hastily, and without examination, denominated P. lusitanica, which 
he had never seen either in a live or dried state ; but which he knew 
was to be found on the west coast of Ross-shire. He traced it in 
great abundance from the bog of Auchterflow to Boggiewell, Rad- 
dery, a distance of more than two miles, and although he, no 
doubt, looked upon it with the eye of an experienced botanist, 
which he is, and observed the difference in the form of the spur, 
the specific character of the genus, yet, never questioning his first 
impression, and far less dreaming of being in possession of a plant 
which had as yet no place in the British Flora, and being content 
with finding a new and extraordinary station for P. Insitanica, 
which had never been found on the east coast of the kingdom, 
and rarely if ever in the interior, he sent specimens of it as such 
to several botanical friends, and among others to Mr H. C. Wat- 



AVOCII. 



389 



son, the author of the Geographical Distribution of British Plants, 
to whom the credit of examining and determining it to be a species 
new to Britain, must be awarded. 

Mr Watson communicated his opinion along with the specimen 
to Dr Graham, who also recognized the plant as P. alpina, and 
was the first to communicate to Mr Gordon the discovery which 
he had been the means of making to the British Flora. Dr 
Graham afterwards described the plant, and got it figured in the 
Botanical Magazine, from live specimens furnished by Mr Gordon. 

This new plant, P. alpina, is confined to the Rosehaugh estate, 
the property of Sir James Weymss Mackenzie of Scatwell, Bart. 
Lord Lieutenant of the county of Ross ; and it is a curious circum- 
stance, that since its discovery, P. lusitanica, which it was at first 
confounded with, has been found by Mr Smith in great abundance, 
on a Highland estate, Kinlochluichart, in the very centre of Ross- 
shire, belonging to the same proprietor. 

IL — Civil History. 

Eminent Characters. — The celebrated Scots historian, priest 
and Lord of Session, Chambers of Ormond, was born in this pa- 
rish about the year 1530. He was proprietor of Castleton and 
Ormond Hill, which gave title to Douglas, Earl of Ormond. 
Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh resided in this parish, and 
had very extensive possessions in it and its vicinity. These are 
now principally the property of the families of Scatwell, and Avoch, 
and Bennetsfield. 

The Chief Land-Oroners. — There are three land-owners : First, 
Sir James W. Mackenzie of Scatwell, Baronet, Lord Lieutenant 
of the county. His seat of Rosehaugh House stands on a beau- 
tiful bank about a mile and a-half from the sea, an elegant modern 
edifice, substantial and commodious. It is surrounded by rich fields 
in high cultivation, well fenced, and skirted with woods of dif- 
ferent kinds. He served for some time as Paymaster of the 55th 
Regiment, in the West Indies. Subsequently, he represented 
the county of Ross in Parliament for three successive Parlia- 
ments, a period of nine years, without opposition. He married 
Henrietta Wharton Mackenzie, sister of the late General John 
Mackenzie of Suddie, who met a death of glory on the field of 
Talavera. An elegant monument is erected in St Paul's, com- 
memorative of his bravery as a soldier, and his high accomplish- 
ments as a gentleman. The second land-owner is Alexander 
Mackenzie, Esq. of Avoch, He is at present qualifying for the

English Bar. He is the son of the late spirited and enter- 
prising Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who, among many other 
important discoveries in North America, discovered the river 
which bears his name. The House of Avoch, whose beautiful 
site was admired by every passer by, was burned in the year 
1833, while it was rented by General Sir Donald Macleod, 
H. E. I. C. S. The third land-owner is John Matheson, Esq. of 
Bennetsfield. He holds the rank of captain in the 78th Regi- 
ment. He long served his King and country in foreign parts. 
He is the chief of the ancient clan Matheson. He is now resi- 
dent on his own estate in this parish — on a beautifully romantic 
spot near Munlochy Bay. 

Parochial Register. — There is a parochial register regularly 
kept. The earliest entry in the oldest register of this parish, which 
was by no means regularly kept, is dated 1727. 

Antiquities. — Almost the only antiquities in this parish are the 
site of the ancient Castle of Avoch, and the ruins of an old tower, 
called Arkendeith. The former occupied a detached rocky knoll — 
about 200 feet above the level of the sea — which juts out from 
the eastern corner of the hill of Castletoun, which forms the north- 
ern promontory of the Bay of Munlochy, and at the distance of 
about a quarter of a mile west from the modern village of Avoch. 
This knoll is now called " Ormond," or the " Lady Hill," and 
its steep sides and smooth summit are bedecked with a green vel- 
vety coat of grass, enriched by the lime and rubbish of the ancient 
buildings, and which marks it out to the eye in the midst of 
the adjoining heathy grounds. The eastern and more accessible 
slope is traversed by three breastworks of earth, with ditches be- 
hind them ; and the summit, which is naturally divided into two 
irregular areas, extending together to about half an acre of ground, 
was covered with buildings formed of stones, cemented by shell- 
lime, exceedingly hiird ; from which encircling walls proceeded 
round the whole upper crest of the rock, and down a slight open- 
ing or ravine orf the south side, along which the principal approach 
was formed, and which, from the accumulation of rubbish at the 
top and bottom, seems to have been guarded by a barbican and 
outer tower, with, in all likelihood, a regular portcullis and gate-way. 

But few historical reminiscences exist of this castle. Mr Eraser 
Tytler, in his History of Scotland, Vol. ii. page 63, mentions that 
Sir Andrew Moray, " a Lord," as described by an ancient chro- 
nicler, "of great bounty, of sober and chaste life, wise and upright 

3 



AVOCII. 



391 



in council, liberal and generous, devout and charitable, stout, 
hardy, and of great courage," sinking under the weight of age, 
and worn out by the constant fatigues of war, retired to his castle 
at Avoch, in Ross, where he soon after died. Winton states that 
he was buried at Rosemarkie, about the year 1338. Subsequent- 
ly the castle passed into the hands of the Earls of Ross ; and on 
the forfeiture of the earldom in 1455, we find among the castles 
then annexed to the patrimony of the Crown, mention made of the 
House of Innerness and Urquhard on Loch Ness, and of " An- 
nache Avoch, Edderdail, callyt Ardmanache." And this annexa- 
tion in the time of James II. was repeated and confirmed by the 
whole Parliament on the 1st July 1476, in favour of James III,, 
who afterwards, on the 29th January 1487, created his second son 
Duke of Ross, Marquis of Ormond, and Earl of Edirdal, otherwise 
called Ardmanache ; from which period the lordship of Ardmana- 
che, or the Black Isle, was generally considered as part of the patri- 
mony of the King's second son. See the Acts of the Parliament 
of Scotland, Thomson's folio edition. Vol. ii. pp. 42, 113, and 181. 

In the annexation in 1455, Redcastle, with the lordship of Ross 
pertaining thereto, is also particularly mentioned. 

Thus the origin of the term Ormond's Mount, as applied to the 
site in question, admits of easy explanation ; that of " the Lady 
Hill" probably results from local tradition having confounded this 
site with that of some religious edifice. Like the Cathedral of 
Fortrose, and many other buildings along the margin of the Mo- 
ray Frith, the Castle of Avoch was most likely razed to the ground 
by the soldiers of Oliver Cromwell, and the stones of it transport- 
ed to form part of his great citadel or fort at' Innerness. 

Of the fortalice or tower of Arkindeith but the lower or dun- 
geon story remains. It is situated close by the farm-house of that 
name, on the hill side, a little way above the offices of Avoch. It 
evidently belonged to a castellated mansion of no great antiquity, 
erected, perhaps, by some of the clergy, who are known to have 
held independent possessions in this parish, exclusive of the glebe 
lands ; or by some of the Bruces of Kinloss, a family who are spe- 
cially mentioned in the printed retours for the seventeenth cen- 
tury, 1611-18, as having held the lands of" Muireal-house and 
Arkindeuch."

Language Sfc. — The English language is spoken by all the fa- 
milies, with the exception of one or two who have recently emi- 
grated from Highland parishes. The game peculiar to the fisher- 
men of this parish is throwing a ball, weighing about four pounds, 
to test their strength and dexterity. It is only practised during 
the new-year holidays, O. S. The competition is often kept up 
with great keenness, and uniformly with good humour. Not un- 
frequently the ardour of the competitors carries them miles along

the tiirupike-road before the jmlm for strength and dexterity is 
yielded. 

Habits and Character of the People.— The ordinary food of the 
peasantry at their meals is oatmeal porridge, and potatoes and fish. 
They are certainly destitute of many comforts ; yet they seem,' 
upon the whole, contented with their situation and circumstances' 
The general character of the people is decidedly moral and religi- 
ous; yet it is remarkable how few in these regions are communicants. 

Superstitions.— Yfheu a fisherman's marriage takes place, there is a 
superstitious practice, which never fails to be observed, even in these 
enlightened days, with the view, it is said, of setting at defiance the 
. power of witchcraft ; and it is this : -When the bridegroom's party 
arrives at the church door, the best man unties the shoe upon the 
eft foot of the bridegroom, and forms a cross with a nail or a 
knife upon the right side post of the door. The shoe of course 
remains untied till next morning. While many admit the absur- 
dity of this rehc of superstition, no one has had the hardihood yet 
to move for its abolition. 

The fishermen here generally marry at an early age, and seldom 
select a bride above nineteen years. The marriage is solemnized 
in the church, on a Friday, but never before 12 o'clock. On one 
occasion there were three marriages to be solemnized on one day. 
I he friends of the parties, as is usual, waited upon me previously 
to engage my services ; I assured them I should be at their com- 
mand ; and requested them to fix upon a convenient hour for the 
three parties to be married at once. The friends of the parties 
looked grave-shook their heads-said nothing. I was entirely at 
a loss to divine what was meant by this sudden gravity of counte- 
nance-the shaking of the head-and the profound silence-and 
begged them to assign me their reason for this mysterious conduct 
After some delay, and hesitation, and reluctance upon their part 
I was given to understand, that if the three parties were to be mar- 
ried at once serious consequences might ensue, for there would be 
a struggle made by each party to get first out of the church ,• be- 
heving as they did, that the party that should get out first would 
carry the blessing. To prevent such serious consequences as might 
ensue, under such circumstances; and these consequences might, 
perchance, prove far more serious than the mere tearing of gowns 
and caps and coats, and these their best of course, I offered to 
marry the parties in succession. But next came the question of pre- 
cedence-a delic.nte and difficult point, at all times to settle, at least 

nOSS AND CROMAIITY.

to settle to every one's satisfaction — a point which they all acknow- 
ledged they were unable to settle — and that is not to be wondered 
at, for they knew that each party wished to be married first. How 
then were we to get out of this second difficulty, became the ques- 
tion. After a cool and deliberate, and I can assure the parties, an 
impartial view of the subject, I thought fit to propose, that the 
party first contracted should be married first. The proposition 
was at once agreed to unanimously. The friends of the parlies to 
be married went home perfectly satisfied with the arrangemenf. 
The three parties were married on the same day in succession. 
But let it be remembered that special care was taken that no party 
should meet any of the other parties either going to or returning 
from the church. Why  Because it would be unlucky. 

IV. — Industry. 

There are in the parish, shoemakers, 26 ; masons, 9 ; boat- 
carpenters, 4; Wrights, 11; tailors, 14; sailors, 5; innkeepers, 5; 
blacksmiths, 5 ; cartwright, 1 ; weavers, 6 ; wheelwrights, 2 ; 
wool-carder, 1 ; pensioners, 5 ; diker, 1 ; gardeners, 3 ; saddler, 
1 ; butcher, 1 ; merchants, 5 ; accoucheur, 1 ; sail-maker, 1 ; ba- 
ker, 1; sawyers, 4; corn-dealer, 1; millers, 2; gamekeeper, 1; 
fiddler, 1 ; piper, 1. 

Fisheries. — At one time there was only one fishing-boat in Avoch, 
the crew of which resided in the country ; now there are nine, 
manned by 10 men each, regularly employed in haddock and whit- 
ing fishing along the Sutherland and Caithness coasts. After sup- 
plying their own families, and the families around Avoch, they take 
the surplus to the Inverness market, a distance of about five miles. 
About the middle of July, Avoch sends forth no less than thirty- 
five boats for the herring-fishing at Caithness, two went last year 
to Aberdeen, for the space of six or eight weeks. Some years 
have crowned our fishermen's perilous labours with great success 
and prosperity; — some of them have returned to their homes with 
L. 20, others with L. 30, others with L. 40, and others with L. 50 
of clear gain. While other years again — such is the uncertainty 
attendant upon all human undertakings — few if any of our fisher- 
men are able to cover the necessary expenses. During this sea- 
son the fishermen and their families have been exposed to no in- 
considerable hardships ; for in consequence of the incessant tem- 
pests, by which so many valuable lives and property on different 
coasts of the empire have been lost, the fishermen were prevented 
from going to the haddock and whiting-fishing for the space of 

4 



AVOCH. 395 

twelve weeks ; and, were it not for the flounders which are caught 
nearly opposite to the village, many families would have been des- 
titute indeed. It is, perhaps, not unworthy of notice, that the first 
fishing after the tempests abated is reported to have been not only 
the most seasonable, but the most successful for the last forty years. 

Agriculture.— V&amp;vt of this parish has not recently been surveyed, 
consequently the exact extent cannot be given : but the following 
will be near the truth : Rosehaugh contains 4929 acres, 26 poles 
imperial, of which 2056 acres, 3 roods is arable; 1344 acres, 20 
poles improveable ; 1340 acres, 3 roods, 24 poles planted or to be 
planted, and 187 acres, 1 rood, 21 poles waste. Avoch contains 
933 acres, and Bennetsfield 336 acres.— Total 6198 acres" 26 
poles. ' 

Rent— The average rent of arable land in this parish may be 
estmiated at L.l, 3s. per imperial acre. 

Improvements.— Thi parish has improved immensely in its agri- 
cultural aspect since the former report of it was published. Then 
the horses and cattle were described as being small, and the imple- 
ments of husbandry scanty and imperfect. Now the horses and cows 
are in general of a very good stamp and breed; and by the art and 
skdl of our handicraftsmen, the implements of husbandry are abun- 
dant and effective. When the last report was drawn up, there was no 
wheat raised m this parish ; but now, it is raised on the three estates- 
and not many years ago a field of wheat on the estate of Rosehaugh 
yielded thirteen returns ; and last year a field of wheat on the 
estate of Avoch might have vied in luxuriance and quality with any • 
field m the Lothians. A regular rotation of croppino-, on the 
most approved of four-shifts system, is almost universally°observed 
Liming IS very generally practised, and in most cases with eminent 
success. It IS not out of place to mention here that turnip= are 
now extensively cultivated; and on several farms they are sown 
with bone manure, and eaten off by sheep; the effects of which 
have been at once profitable to the farmers, and advantageous to 
the sou. ° 

On the estate of Rosehaugh, which comprises more than two- 
thirds of the parish, the leases recently expired, in consequence 
ot which little improvement, comparatively speaking, was effected 
for some years previously. But the proprietor has got a new sur- 
vey and divisions of the lands, by which the possession in " run- 
rig, which was very common, has been abolished, and the extent 
of the -farms regulated and economized to suit one, two, or more

pairs of horse labourings within distinct and convenient boundaries. 
And when granting new leases of nineteen years endurance, over 
the whole lands, the reclaiming and rendering thoroughly arable all 
the improvable waste ground was conditioned for, and the tenantry, 
now secure of their holdings, are going on with spirit and activity. 
And when the belts and clumps of planting which the proprietor 
has reserved, and is now enclosing, are completed, the district will 
assume a different and much more highly improved appearance. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town to Avoch is the roval 
burgh of Fortrose, about a mile and three-quarters distant. 

Means of Comiminication. — There is a turnpike road through the 
southern district of the parish, which leads to Fort- George Ferrv 
on the east, to Kessock Ferry on the south-west, and to the roval 
burgh of Dingwall on the north-west. The toll lets at L. 67 per 
annum. In the year 1829, when such appalling devastations were 
committed by the floods in the north of Scotland, the bridge of 
Avoch was entirely swept away. The burn having for some days 
assumed the appearance and the power of a mighty river. A new 
bridge was speedily erected with a higher arch. It and all the 
other bridges and parapets are kept in good condition. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is very conveniently si- 
tuated, on the southern side of the parish, close to the village, in 
which nearly one-half of the whole population reside. There are 
none of the parishioners residing at a much greater distance from 
it than three miles. It was built in the year 1670, new roofed 
and enlarged in the year 1792, and the ceiling was lathed and 
plastered in the year 1833. It is at present upon the whole in a 
pretty comfortable state of repair, and affords accommodation for 
more than 600 ; some of the seats are the property of private indi- 
viduals. The remainder in general belong to farms on the estates 
of the heritors, for which no payment is exacted. The manse was 
built in 1822, the extent of the glebe in detached parts amounting 
to 5 acres, 3 roods, 16 poles, 2 yards imperial, and may be valued 
at L.2 per acre. The stipend amounts to 93 quarters, 1 boll, 2 
firlots, 3 quarts of barley, and to 159 cwt. 108 lbs. of oatmeal, pay- 
able at the rate of the fiar prices. The average for the last seven 
years is L. 260. The annual allowance for communion elements 
is L.8, 6s. 8d. There is one Dissenting place of worship in the 
village, erected in the year 1819. It is an Independent chapel in 
communion with the Congregational Union of Scotland. The mi- 



AVOCH. 397 

nister is paid by the seat rents and weekly collections at the chapel 
door. The number of families and persons of all ages attending 
the Established Church and the Dissenting chapel is always very 
considerable. The average number of communicants in the Esta- 
blished Church is 93. The number of Dissenting or Seceding 
families is 46. 

Education. — There are two schools in this parish, the parochial 
school and one supported solely by school fees. The branches 
of education taught in the parochial school are, English reading, 
grammar, Latin, Greek, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, and na- 
vigation. In the voluntary school, English reading,' writing, and 
arithmetic are taught. The parochial schoolmaster's salary is 
L. 30, and the school-fees, which, from the poverty of the people, 
are ill paid, may amount to something between L. 20 and L. 30- 
He has the legal accommodations. The general expense of edu- 
cation may be estimated at 6d. or 8d. per month. 

Friendly Society. — There is one Friendly Society in this parish, 
established in the year 1830, the objects of which are, by means 
of assessment and quarterly subscriptions, to form a fund for de- 
fraying the funeral expenses of members and of their wives, and to 
insure a certain allowance to supply the wants of invalid members 
and widows. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number upon the poor's roll 
at present is 100. Two distributions are made from the funds in 
the course of the year, in January and in July. The average sum 
allotted to each at these periods is 3s. But intermediate allow- 
ances are always made, when required, to meet as far as possible 
all pressing exigencies. The annual amount of church collections 
for the relief of the poor averages L. 20 Sterling. The stock at 
present is L. 160. In the year 1728, Sir Kenneth Mackenzie of 
Scatwell, Bart, mortified 900 merks Scots, which sum now yields 
L. 2, lOs. per annum, the annual interest of 600 of which was to 
be distributed among the poor of the parish, and the interest of 
the remaining 300 was to be given to a catechist, in terms of the 
deed of mortification. It may not be out of place— indeed it is 
but an act of justice to the charitable— to record here, that several 
handsome sums have been contributed to said poor's stock at dif- 
ferent periods, from different sources. A legacy of L. 30 was be- 

• As no catechist is required in this parish, tliis sum is given to the parochial 
teacher, to aid in remunerating him for his unwearied exertions in teaching a Sab- 
bath evening scliool—where, to keep up a spirit of enuilallon, a prize is awarded 
every six weeks.

queathed by the late incumbent, the Rev. James Smith, in 1830. 
A donation of L. 50 was made on the 20th June 1835, by Sir 
James W. Mackenzie of Scatwell, Bart., on which day his son 
arrived at majority; and in November 1838," a handsome dona- 
tion was made by James J. R. Mackenzie, Esq. younger of Scat- 
well, on his marriage with the Right Honourable Lady Anne 
Wentworth Fitzwilliam. In addition to all this, the principal 
heritor. Sir James Mackenzie of Scatwell, Bart., makes a present 
to the poor of the parish of six bolls of meal, on the 20th June— 
the birth-day of his son ; and the same quantity in February to 
the poor on Rosehaugh estate. On the 14th February 1839, a 
considerable quantity of coals was distributed among the poor by 
Alexander Mackenzie, Esq. of Avoch, on his arriving at ma- 
jority. 

Inns. — There are six inns in the village, yet such is the tem- 
perate and peaceable deportment of the people, that rarely, in- 
deed, are irregularities or excesses heard of. The proprietors, 
with a real regard for the morals of their tenantry, do not grant 
license even for a single inn or alehouse in the landward part of 
the parish. 

Fuel—This parish is amply supplied with coals from Newcastle, 
which at present are selling at lOd. per cwt. They are delivered 
at the pier of Avoch, which is a most substantial and commodious 
erection, and is not' only of essential benefit to the fishermen, but 
to the district at large, as it facilitates the exportation of grain 
and wood, and the importation of coal, salt, lime, and bone dust. 
The district is indebted for this incalculable advantage to the 
patriotic exertions of the late Sir Alexander Mackenzie of Avoch. 
From the poverty of the inhabitants, however, the fuel principally 
used in the landward district of the parish is turf, and in the vil- 
lage brushwood, which is carried in bundles by the fishermen's 
wives and daughters almost daily from plantations in the neigh- 
bourhood.

PRESBYTERY OF DINGWALL, SYNOD OF UOSS. 

THE REV. JAMES MACDONALD, MINISTER  



• — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, Situation, and Extent. — Urray is composed of the unit- 
ed parishes of Urray and Kilchrist. The former seems to derive 
its name from its local situation. The church and burying-ground 
lie on a large plain, on the banks of the rapid river Orrin, near its 
conflux with the Connon. The Orrin has, in the course of ages, 
evidently shifted its bed, and its passable fords, through every part 
of that plain, and would repeat its ravages almost every season, 
were it not restrained by the annual exertions of the surrounding 
proprietors. Hence it is probable the name is derived from Ur-a, 
the new ford. Kilchrist is evidently Cella Christi, a burying- 
ground consecrated to Christ. — It is situated chiefly in the county 
of Ross : A small part of it lies in Inverness-shire. It extends from 
the Frith of Beauly on the south, to the north side of the river 
Connon, about 7 English miles in a straight line, nearJy from 
south to north. Its breadth on the banks of the Connon, from 
east to west, is about 6 English miles, but does not exceed 3 to- 
wards the southern boundary, along the Frith of Beauly. The 
intermediate space lines the foot of the great chain of mountains 
which extends from thence to the west coast of Scotland. There 
is a davoch of land belonging to this parish in the valley of Strath- 
connon, in the bosom of the western mountains, at the distance of 
10 computed, or 18 English miles. It is surrounded by the pa- 
rish of Contin, and forms a part of the mission in that parish. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate. — The general face of the parish pre- 
sents a picturesque view of corn-fields, intermixed with barren 
moor, clumps of natural wood, rapid streams, large plantations 
around gentlemen's seats, with diff'erent views of the two beautiful 
Friths of Dingwall and Beauly, which, as canals formed by the

band of nature, and penetrating for upwards of twenty miles info 
a populous country, invite the merchant and manufacturer to settle 
on their banks. The soil is as various as the general foce of the 
ground ; but on the whole, is warm, dry, and productive. The 
fields on the slopes of the rising-grounds are comparatively of a 
richer soil than the low-ground, except a part of the estate of Lo- 
vat, which once belonged to the priory of Beauly, and is a deep, 
rich, carse ground. The plains abound with pebbles, from four 
to six or eight pound weight, evidently rounded by friction, and 
intermixed with beds of dry sand and gravel. Hence a consider- 
able part of the low-ground is barren dry moor, producing only a 
short heath ; and the arable land, with a few exceptions, of infe- 
rior quality to that on the high lands. On one estate there are 
several small hollows surrounded by this dry barren soil, which 
seem to have been once small lakes, but are now filled with peat 
moss. On the bottom of several of them some strata of shell marl 
have been found. 

mvers.— The Beauly empties itself into the Frith of that name 
at the south-west point of the parish, and cannot be said to belong 
to It. The Connon intersects the parish near the north end, and 
is composed of four great branches.f The Orrin, running from 
S. W., falls into the Connon below Brahan Castle; a very irregular 
stream, fordable in many places during summer, but sometimes 
rising very suddenly to an alarming height, and proving a very 
unwelcome and destructive visitant to all within its reach. Mr 
Mackenzie of Seaforth generously defrayed the expense of a 
wooden bridge thrown across it some years ago behind the manse 
of Urray ; but this was carried away by the flood of September 
1839. It has been lately repaired at the expense of the county, 
and promises defiance to the violence of the stream. 

About two miles west from Urray, the Garve falls in on the north 
side, which running from W. N. W. rises on the confines of Loch- 
broom. Thence, five miles farther west, is the junction of the other 
two branches, the Meig and the Lichart. The former rises on the 
borders of Lochcarron to the W. S. W. ; and the source of the 
latter is on the confines of Gairioch to the west,— The Connon 

 Old Statistical Account. 

t There is a spring on the bank of the Connon, near the west end of the parisli 
strongly impregnated with sulphur. The water is as clear as any other spring but 
smells like the scourings of a foul gun. It is said to partake of the nature of Har- 
rowgate water, and to be useful in scorbutic complaints and rlieumatism. It is of the 
same kind with the much frequented spring of Strathpcfler, in the noighbourliood

II. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — There is a register of births and marri- 
ages, — the former commencing with the year 1756, and the latter 
with the year 1815. The register of births previous to the year 
1820 was very irregularly kept, a great many names having been 
left out, and those in many cases entered. improperly. The record 
was not even signed by the session-clerk. 

Land-oioners. — In whole, there are eleven land-holders in the 
parish, the principal of whom are the following : —

Education.~There are 4 schools in the parish, two parochial 
schools, one Society school, and one Episcopal school, under the 
patronage of Mr Gillanders, Highfield. There is only one Sab- 
bath school at present, but other two are in contemplation. All 
these schools are within the compass of four miles: and no more 
schools are required. The salary of each of the parochial school- 
masters amounts to L.25 yearly. The probable yearly amount 
of fees actually paid to one of them is not more than L. 6 The 
other school having newly begun, the amount of fees actually re- 
ceived by the teacher cannot be stated. The probable yearly 
amount of the other emoluments belonging to the first parochial 
teacher is L. 7. A Female School of Industry is about to be 
opened under the immediate patronage of Mrs Mackenzie of Ord 
-a lady of exemplary piety, and full of zeal for supplying the 
destitute with useful and scriptural education. 

Poor.The number of persons receiving parochial aid, ave 
rages from 50 to 70. The average sum allowed to each yearly 
IS about 6s. The average annual amount of contributions' for

tions.

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. HECTOR ALLAN, MINISTER.' 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish is of Celtic origin, being de- 
rived from Cinn-na'n-Airdean signifying the extremities of the 
heights : several lofty ranges of hills coming to a termination here. 
The etymology of Kincardine, in the former Statistical Account, 
is said to be Cinn-nd -Chair dean, or the heads of the friends ; the 
reason for giving that derivation being, that " the chief of the clan 
Ross, and his most powerful and confidential friends dwelt here, 
and fixed the name Kincardine to the place where they resided." 
But this is not nearly such a probable etymology as the first. 

Extent, Boundaries, §-c. — The parish extends from east to 
west upwards of 35 miles, and varies in breadth from 5 to 
20. It is bounded by the parishes of Creich, Assynt, and 
Loch broom, on the north and west ; and by Eddertoun, Rosskeen, 
and Fodderty, on the east and south. At the east end, where 
the church and manse are situated, it is very narrow, but it widens 
gradually to the western extremity, where the boundary between 
it and Assynt, and the counties of Ross and Sutherland, is a small 
rivulet called Alltan-ndn-Cealgach, or the burn of the deceitful, 
which flows from a long lake, with low and uninteresting banks, 
called Loch Boarlan. The reason of this rather extraordinary 
name having been given to the burn, was, that, in determining the 
boundary between the parishes of Assynt and Kincardine, the wit- 
nesses encroached considerably on the Assynt side, and made oath 
that they stood on Ross-shire ground, having earth from Kincar- 
dine in their shoes  At this extremity the " forest of Balnagown" 
a leafless one  is situated; it is a hill of great extent, and re- 
markable for the large size of its deer. The parish of Kincardine 
is partly in the county of Ross, and partly in that of Cromarty.

It consists of several straths and glens, and abounds in hills and 
rivers. 

Hydrography.— The division betwixt this parish and the county 
of Sutherland is an arm of the sea, commonly called the Kyle; 
the tide flows twelve miles up this frith from Bonar, and receives 
three rivers, the Oikell, the Cassley, and the Shin in its course. 
These are all excellent angling streams ; and in the Cassley, 
about a mile above Rosehall, there is a very remarkable waterfall, 
forming a salmon leap of great altitude. The lochs in the parish, 
though not of great extent, are very numerous ; and some of them 
contain excellent trout. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The prevailing rocks here belong to 
the granite and sandstone formation. This parish remains hither- 
to unexplored by any who have knowledge of mines. On the 
farm of Dibidale, stands one of our highest mountains, called 
Carnchuinaig, on which stones have been found perfectly simi- 
lar to those known by the name of Cairngorms ; and Knockirny, 
where the parish marches with Assynt, abounds in marble, white 
and party-coloured. On the top of the highest mountain in Bal- 
nagown forest, which is called Sciulm-a-'Charra, and is distant 
many miles from the sea, shells of different sorts offish are found, 
some of them deeply imbedded in the earth. 

Zoology.— In the remote parts, amongst the hills, are red-deer 
{Cervus elephas; and roes C. capreolus also abound. Foxes 
{Canis vulpes are exceedingly numerous, and destroy quantities of 
sheep, notwithstanding all the precautions that can be taken to pre- 
vent them. Badgers  Ursus meles, and wild cats  Pelis catusferis, 
are also found. In the rivers, there are otters {Mustela lutra. 
Hares, rabbits, polecats, and weasels, are very plentiful ; and far- 
mers complain much of the operations of the mole  Talpa Euro- 
pea. Squirrels are also found in the woods of Glen Ainaig. 

Birds.— Be&amp;iAes the several domestic kinds, there are a great 
variety in the fields, woods, hills, and rivers ; such as the wood 
and mountain thrush Turdus, green linnet {Loxia Moris,

Botany. — Among the rarer plants found in this parish, the fol-

a mossy height near the bridge of Oikell ; and amongst the trees 
on the banks of that river, the Hieracium deniiculatum occurs 
in great luxuriance, and sometimes upwards of four feet high. 
Dr Greville found the very rare plant Ribes petrcewn, three miles 
east of Rosehall. Hieracium aJpivum grows on some of the lofty 
hills ; and Isoetes- hicustris, Eleocharis muUicaulis, Juncus balti- 
cus, and Betiila nana, also exist, and the last very abundantly. 

IT. — Civil History. 

The first era to which reference can be made in the history of 
this parish, is the fourteenth century, in which the battle of Tui- 
team-Tarbhach took place. 

This serious conflict arose out of the following circumstances : 
Angus Mackay, the chief of the Mackays, had married a daughter 
of Torquil Macleod of Lewis, by whom he had two sons, Angus 
Dow, so termed from his black hair, and Roderick Gald or 
Lowland. Angus died young, leaving his sons and his lands un- 
der the tutorage and government of his brother, Houcheon Dow 
Mackay; some dispute happeningbetween the tutor, — as Houcheon 
was called — and his sister-in-law, the widow of the late Angus, 
probably regarding the management of the estates and tutory, to 
which she claimed a preferable title, in right of her son, Angus 
Dow, she complained to her brother, Malcolm, the chief of 
Lewis ; who, in consequence, came to the Reay country, accom- 
panied by a number of chosen men, resolving to have his sister re- 
dressed, either by treaty or by .force. He appears, however, not 
to have succeeded in his object, for he returned homeward in great 
displeasure, and in revenge laid waste Strathnaver, and a great 
part of the Breachat in Sutherland, in the Mackay's lands, besides 
driving off a great spoil of cattle. As soon as Houcheon Dow 
and his younger brother Neil Mackay, learnt this intelligence, they 
acquainted Robert, Earl of Sutherland, who immediately dispatched 
Alistair Ne-Shrem-Gor.me Alexander Murray of Cubin, with a 
number of resolute men, to assist the Mackays. They pursued 
the islanders with great haste, and overtook them at a place in the

ZtTT tr. '" --" ' "t this being opposed by 
Macleod and h,s men, a furious battle ensued, in which great va- 
lour was displayed on both sides. It was - long, forious, cruel 
and doubtful," says Sir Robert Gordon in his'" Genealocd 
History of the Earldom of Sutherland," and was « rather despe- 
M l Lewismen, with their leader, 

Malco m Macleod, who was nicknamed Gill- callum-heg-Maclhowan, 
were slam ; one man alone, who was sorely womided, escaping to 
carry home the dismal tidings to Lewis, which he had scarcely 
delivered, when he expired. The place of the fight was thence- 
forward called Tu.team-Tarbhach, which signifies the/.;-e7e fall 
or slaughter. A little to the east of the field of battle, there is a 
lonely unenclosed burial-ground, picturesquely situated on an ele- 
vated bank, where those who fell were interred; its sequestered 
situation. Its grey, moss-covered stones, and its nameless grave., 
all combine in increasing the natural solemnising influence of the 
scene. The period when this conflict occurred has not been ac- 
curately ascertained. Sir Robert Gordon says, In the time of 
Robert, Earl of Sutherland, son of Nicholas, the terrible battle of 
1 uttim-Tarvach was fought ;"— now, as « Robert succeeded to the 
earldom, by the death of his father, in the year 199," accordiuo- 
to Sir Robert, the battle must have taken place either in the end 
of the fourteenth century, or the beginning of the fifteenth; but 
Irom Sir Robert's not always being very particular in his dates, 
the year 1397 may be considered as about the time of this 
event. 

From the fourteenth till the seventeenth century, there is no 
land-mark in the history of this parish. But abouthe middle of 
the latter century, the following incident occurred : In the month 
of April 1650, the celebrated Marquess of Montrose, in prosecu- 
tion of his chivalrous enterprize'for placing Charles II. on the 
throne of his ancestors, arrived in Orkney, and, crossing the Pent- 
land Frith with about 1300 men, landed without opposition at the 
northern extremity of Caithness. He had calculated on collect- 
ing a considerable force in this country, but completely failed ; 
succeeding, however, in securing the passes of the Ord', leading 
into Sutherland, and possessing himself of the castle of Dunbeatb. 
The Earl of Sutherland retired before him as he advanced, and 
Montrose reached Strath Oikell, but with a force of only 1200 men.

Lieutenant- Colonel Strachan, who had hurried forward with a 
party of horse, while General Leslie was pressing on with 3000 
foot. It was resolved that the Earl should cross into Sutherland 
to intercept Montrose's retreat to the north, while Strachan ad- 
vanced with 230 horse, and 170 foot, in search of him. Under 
cover of some broom, they succeeded in surprising him at disad- 
vantage, on level ground, near a pass called Invercharron, on the 
borders of this parish, on Saturday, 27th April 1650, having di- 
verted his attention by the display of merely a small body of horse. 
Montrose immediately endeavoured to reach a wood and craggy 
hill at a short distance in his rear, with his infantry, but they were 
overtaken ; the Orkney men made but little resistance, and the 
Germans surrendered, but the few Scottish soldiers fought bravely, 
though in vain. Many gallant cavaliers were made prisoners ; and 
when the day was irretrievably lost, the Marquess threw oflf his 
doak bearing the star, and afterwards changed clothes with an 
ordinary Highland kern, that he might endeavour to effect his es- 
cape. Having swam across the Kyle, an arm of the sea dividing 
this parish from Sutherland, he directed his flight up Strath 
Oikell, and lay for three days concealed amongst the wilds of 
Assynt ; but at length, exhausted with fatigue and hunger, he was 
discovered and apprehended by a Ross-shire chief— Neil Macleod 
of Assynt, who happened to be out with some of his tenants in 
search of him. Montrose discovered himself to this man, think- 
ing himself secure of protection, since Macleod had been once his 
own follower. His subsequent fate is too well known to require 
being mentioned here : and we shall conclude this article with the 
following extract from a modern historian of celebrity : " James 
Graham, Marquess of Montrose, died at the early age of 38, hav- 
ing acquired, during a short career of military glory, greater repu- 
tation than perhaps ever fell to the lot of any commander in an- 
cient or modern times, within the same compass of time." 

The ground where the battle was fought, and which lies in this 
parish, took its present name, Craigcaoineadhan, which may be 
translated the Rock of Lamentation,— from the event of thatmemo- 
rable day. The ancient name of the place is now lost. 

Eminent Characters. — In a parish comparatively so remote as 
Kincardme, eminent characters can scarcely be expected : yet 
they are not entirely wanting. 

Mr Thomas Ross. — The historian Wodrow remarks, that, sub- 
sequent to the establishment of Episcopacy in 1662, there were 

 



" ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

but few Presbyterian clergymen remaining north of the Tav and 
only two or three who laboured in the work of the ministry/in the 
shires of Ross and Cromarty. Amongst these he places « Mr 
Ihomas Ross, minister at Kincardin," who, he says, « having 
continued at his charge some time after the establishment of Pre- 
lacy, owed his leaving them to a meeting with Mr M'Gilliffen " 
Vol Hi. p. 437, 8vo edit. Mr Ross's name also appears in the 
roll ot ministers who were non-conformists to Prelacy, and were 
banished, turned out from their parishes, or confined," as aiven in 
Wodrow ; Vol. i. p. 329 ; though it is there erroneously placed 
in the presbytery of Dingwall, instead of that of Tain, and with- 
out the name of his parish prefixed. The same historian men- 
tions, that, in the summer of 1675, Mr John M'Gillio-en Mr 
Anderson, of Cromarty, Mr Frazer, of Daviot, or Tevfot, as he 
spells It, and Mr Thomas Ross, " were very frequent, and much 
owned of the Lord in their work." On the 4th of November in 
this year Mr Ross was apprehended for conventicles, as the field- 
meetings of the Covenanters were termed, and imprisoned in 
lam: Here he remained until the 9th of October 1677, when 
the council - appointed Mr Thomas Ross, who is prisoner in the 
tolbooth of Tayn, to be liberate, upon his finding caution to com- 
pear when called, upon the pain of 2000 merks." It would ap- 
pear that Mr Ross died soon after his liberation from the « tol- 
booth of Tayn," as there is no further mention made of him. He 
was minister at Tain for several years, having gone there about 
the year 1664 In the appendix to the " Memoirs of the Rev. 
John Blackader," there is given a list of all the ministers who were 
confined to the Bass; and under the date « 1675" is inserted 
"Thomas Ross, minister of Kincardine Tain, for conventicles.

was ever imprisoned in the Bass; and the reference to Wodrow is 
incorrect, tliere being no mention of Mr Ross in " Vol. ii. 393." 

In the preface to a work pubHshed at Edinburgh in 1738, entitled 
" Memoirs of the Life of the Very Reverend Mr James Fraser of 
Brea, Minister of the Gospel at Culross, dedicated by the au- 
thor to the Very Reverend Mr Thomas Ross, Minister at Kinca'- 
dine in Ross" it is stated that, " by the dedication to Mr Thomas 
Ross, a singularly pious minister in the north, the author gave per- 
mission to him to publish it and that " the reason why Mr Tho- 
mas Ross did not cause publish it, was, that at the time he receiv- 
ed it from Mr Fraser, he was in prison at Tayne, and died there 
in prison or soon thereafter ;" and in the publisher's address to 
the reader, there is the following: — " Our copy, as you'll see by 
the preface" as quoted above " is dedicated to the Reverend 
Mr Thomas Ross, some time minister at Tayne, with a power to 
publish it or not as he pleased." Mr Fraser, in the " dedication 
by the author to Mr Thomas Ross," at p. 6, expresses himself 
towards Mr Ross in language glowing with gratitude and Christian 
friendship, and lets it appear from the terms he uses, that he con- 
sidered himself " much bound unto him," and was anxious to 
" kyth his gratitude" by something of that nature. Now this, 
coming from the pen of so eminent an individual as Fraser of Brea, 
is no small compliment to the worthy " minister of Kincardine 
and shows the high estimation in which he was held by his con- 
temporaries. 

One other notice of Mr Ross : In the Scottish Acts of Par- 
liament, Vol. ix. p. 217, A. D. 1690, there is an " Act in 
favours of Christian Ross, relict of Andrew Fearne of Pitcal- 
lion, anent her damages," which states, inter alia, that " her 
husband in his lifetime helped to entertain Mr Thomas Ross, 
a Godly minister ; and that she entertained him and others 
of that degree, and some other distressed people passing to and 
fro, in her familie; and that she was harassed, and persecuted, 
and informed against, with her twelve fotherless children, by the 
Episcopal minister of her parish, and compelled .to flee in the mid- 
dle of the night during the winter of 1683-4, her property and 
corn seized by the soldiers, and her farailie scattered." Mr Ross, 
it appears, had occasionally preached to a small audience within 
her house ; and for this offence, her parish minister, contrary 
to the remonstrances of Lord Seaforth, obtained from the Privy- 
council a warrant to a military officer to seize all her goods,

attach the rents of her small estate, and imprison herself. The 
two former were executed with the utmost rigour, and herself ob- 
liged to fly, as is mentioned above, in her narrative to the Parlia- 
ment. She continued in concealment in Sutherland until the year 
1686, when, by the interest of friends, the Council allowed her to 
return home to Pitcallion, or Pitculzean, as it is now spelt. 

Dr Robertson oj Kiltearn. — Here, too, the name of the late Rev. 
Harry Robertson, D. D., minister of Kiltearn, is well entitled to a 
place, as connected with this parish by birth. Harry, eldest son 
of the Rev. Gilbert Robertson, minister of Kincardine, and Chris- 
tian Bain, daughter of the Rev. John Bain, minister of Ding- 
wall, 1716-1736, vras born at the manse of Kincardine, on. the 
2d of November 1748. Having been licensed by the presbytery 
of Tain in the year 1770, he was ordained and admitted to the 
parish of Clyne, 8th May 1771 ; and translated thence to Kiltearn, 
on the 9th May 1776. He died at Kiltearn manse, 28th July 1815, 
in the 67th year of his age, and 45th of his ministry. 

Family of Ross.—T\\e clan Ross, as far back as tradition goes, 
were the proprietors and inhabitants of this district. They still re- 
tain three-fourths of the property of the parish, and are by much 
the most prevalent name in it. Vestiges of the ancient resi- 
dence of their chiefs are to be seen in a beautiful field, between 
the church and the sea side. The field terminates in a steep bank 
hanging over the sea, called the Bank of the Gate, and at the bot- 
tom there is a spring of excellent water, which bears the name of 
the Lady's Well. The chief of the clan and his most powerful and 
confidential friends dwelt here ; as pasture for cattle, with fishing 
and hunting, the favourite employment of the Highlanders, could 
be easily had in the greatest variety. The chief of the Rosses 
is-mentioned at a very remote period in the neighbourhood of St 
Duthus. This must have happened when he was invested with the 
power and jurisdiction of Thane, for the town, then a village, close 
by the sanctuary of St Duthus, still retains the name of that 
holy man in Gaelic, {Baile-Dhuthaich, and in English it is cal- 
led Tain. The ancient earldom of Ross was created by King 
Malcolm HL, when he held a Parliament at Forfar about the 
middle of the eleventh century; in the year 1221, Ferquhard 
Ross, who founded the Abbey of Fearn, was possessor of the title, 



' Duthac or DufTus was bishop of Ross temp. Alexander II., .nnd died in 1249 : 
he was of a noble family, and for his great piety was canonized, the 8th of March be- 
ing appointed as a festival day in honour of hiin.

and from his death, in 1251, there is a regular succession of 
that surname till the death of William, Earl of Ross, in 1371, 
without male issue ; after which there were numerous claimants, 
and the title was possessed by individuals of different families, all 
claiming some right to hold it; until finally, in 1478, the earldom 
of Ross was annexed to the Crown ; by whom, at different periods, 
it was conferred on members of the royal family. The present 
representative of this ancient title, and of the chieftainship of the 
clan Ross, is George RossofPitcalnie; whose ancestor, Monroe Ross 
of Pitcalnie, claimed the earldom in 1778, as lineal male descendant 
of Hugh Ross of Rarichies, and first laird of Balnagown, a. d. 1370, 
brother to William, last Earl of Ross. The estates of Amat, where 
there is a dwelling-house, Corrimuillie, and Amatnatua in this pa- 
rish,- belong to Pitcalnie. 

The principal branch of the family of Ross settled at Balnagown. . 
Thechief of the clan about the middle of the seventeenth century 
was David Ross, the lineal descendant and heir of the Earls of 
Ross. He married, in 1666, Lady Anne Stewart, youngest daugh- 
ter of James, third Earl of Moray, but died, without issue,' "l8th 
April 1711, when the chieftainship of the Rosses, in the Balna- 
gown family, became extinct. Lady Anne, who was endowed no 
less with the gifts of nature than with those of grace, survived till 
the 16th of August 1719. She bequeathed the sum of 3000 merk.s 
Scots, for the behoof of some " indigent persons, fearing the Lord, 
in the county of Ross." The estates of Balnagown now descend- 
ed to Charles, second son of George, eleventh Lord Ross, as next 
heir. He was born 8th Februray 1667, and having early embraced 
the military profession, rose to the highest rank in that service. 
He had a principal command, and was particularly instrumental in 
obtaining great honour to his country over the King of France, 
in two bloody wars for the liberty of Europe, during the reign 
of Queen Mary the second, and William of Orange. In the 
reigns of Queen Anne and King George L, he was colonel of a 
regiment of dragoons, and was in five parliaments knight of the 
shire of Ross. In 1721, he was a member of the Secret Committee 
for the affairs of the South Sea Company, and died at Bath, in the 
66th year of his age, 5th August 1732. His remains were brought 
down to Scotland, and interred in a stone coffin within the Abbey of 
Fearn, where there is a neat monument erected to his memory, 
with an inscription in Latin. Having no family himself, the Ho- 
nourable General Ross had entailed his properties upon the children

of his sister, the Honourable Grizel Ross, wife of Sir James Lock- 
hart ofCarstairs, whose second son. Colonel Sir James Ross, accord- 
ingly succeeded. He enjoyed the estate of Balnagown till his death, 
in December 1760, when, by the provisions of his uncle's will, Cap- 
tain John Lockhart, his younger brother, obtained the property, 
and thereupon took the name of Ross in addition to his own. Cap- 
tain Lockhart Ross was the fifth son of Sir James Lockhart of 
Carstairs, Bart, and was born at Lockhart Hall, in the county of 
Lanark, on the 11th November 1721 ; and having manifested a 
predominant inclination for the sea, he entered the naval service 
in his fourteenth year. In 1756, he was posted, and advanced to 
the command of the Tartar frigate of 24 guns, with which, in the 
course of fifteen months, he captured, in the British channel, nine 
of the enemy's ships of war, several of them being of superior force. 
The last step of promotion he lived to attain in the navy was the 
rank of Vice- Admiral of the Blue, to which he was advanced on 
the 24th September 1787. By the death of his brother. Sir 
George Lockhart, in July 1778, the baronetcy of the family de- 
scended to him, and the estate of Carstairs having been sold in 
1762, he adopted the designation of Balnagown. As an instance 
of his amiable character in private life, the following deserves 
particular mention : There being a total failure of all means 
of subsistence, in consequence of a severe frost in summer 
1782, which was a fatal and distressing year to the peasantry 
in Ross-shire, and especially to the inhabitants of this parish, 
Sir John, with a liberality which does him the highest credit, 
understanding the lamentable situation of the poor people, sent 
to be distributed to the sufferers on his own estates,, a season- 
able and bountiful supply of large quantities of pease, barley, flour, 
and potatoes ; to which noble beneficence many hundreds owed 
their lives. He also ordered his factor to give to his Highland 
tenants in Kincardine, who did not save as much as would sow 
their crofts, seed from his farms in the low country, where the 
failure was not nearly so great as in the high grounds and straths; 
and upon his return home at the conclusion of the war, he dis- 
counted one-third of the arrears of rent over the whole of his es- 
tates. Sir John Lockhart Ross, Bart, died at his seat of Balna- 
gown 9th June 1790, in the sixty-ninth year of his age, after a lin- 
gering and painful illness, which he bore with Christian fortitude 
and resignation. He was interred in the Ross aisle, forming the 
east end of the church of Fearn, formerly the first abbacy in the

country, which has been the biirying-place'of all the respectable 
families of the name of Ross for several centuries. By his spouse, 
Miss Elizabeth Baillie of Lammingtoune, eldest daughter of Ro- 
bert Dundas of Arniston, Lord President of the Court of Session, 
1760—1783, to whom he was married on the 6th September 
1762, he left a family of five sons and three daughters ; and was 
succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son, Sir Charles 
Ross, who for many years represented his native county in Parha- 
ment, and died a Lieutenant- General in the army, and Colonel of 
the S6th Regiment of Foot. Sir Charles Ross married, first, 
Matilda- Theresa, a Countess of the Holy Roman Empire, being 
daughter and heir of General Count James Lockhart of Carnwath, 
by whom he had a sou, who died in childhood ; and a daughter, 
Matilda, who married, in 1812, Sir Thomas John Cochrane, Cap- 
tain R. N., and brother of Archibald ninth Earl of Dundonald ; 
she died in 1819, leaving two sons and two daughters. Sir Charles 
married, secondly, 15th April 1799, Lady Mary Fitzgerald, eldest 
daughter of William Robert, second Duke of Leinster, and left, 
with five daughters, an only son, born in January 1812, the pre- 
sent Baronet. Bonninton House, the beautiful residence of his 
amiable widow. Lady Mary Ross, and the home of all hospitable 
kindnesses, is situated in Lanarkshire, 

Janet Macleod, the Fasting Woman. — A remarkable instance of 
abstinence occurred, about the middle of last century, in this pa- 
rish. Janet Macleod, the person alluded to, was born about the 
year 1727 at Croick, in the heights of the parish of Kincardine, 
where her father, Donald Macleod, possessed a small farm. She 
continued healthy till she was fifteen years of age, when she had 
a severe epileptic fit ; after this she had an interval of health for 
four years, and then another fit, which continued a whole day and 
a night: A few days after, she was seized with a fever, which con- 
tinued with violence for several weeks, and from which she did not 
recover for some months. At this time she lost the use of her 
eyelids, so that she was under the necessity of keeping them open 

 The followin"' notice of bis character and death is engrossed in the session-re- 
cords of the parish ;— " General Sir Charles Ross of Balnagowu, Baronet, principal 
heritor in this parish, died on Tuesday, the 8th day of February 1814, suckionly, 
and at Balnagown Castle,— a loss irreparable to the country at large, and to tl"s Pa- 
rish in particular. His many virtues as a husband, a parent, a master, a hindlord, a 
patriot, and a friend, endeared him to all who bad the honour of his acquaintance, 
and will embalm his memory on their hearts to the latest recollection. May the 
Almighty grant consolation to his atllictcd lady, and spare his amiable daughters and 
his infant son to emulate bis virtues."

with her fingers when she wished to look about her. In other re 
spects, she continued in pretty good health, but she often spat 
large quantities of blood, and at the same time it flowed from her 
nose. This continued for several years, bufc at last it ceased • 
and soon after she had another fit, and after that a fever, from' 
which she recovered very slowly. Six weeks after the crisis 
she stole out of the house unknown to her parents, who were 
busy in their harvest-work, and bound the sheaves of a ridge 
before she was observed ; but in the evening of that day, she 
took to bed, complaining much of her head, and from that 
time she never rose for five years, but was occasionally lifted 
out of bed. She seldom spoke a word, and took so little 
tood, that It seemed insufficient to support a sucking infant ; even 
this small quantity was taken by compulsion; and at last, about 
Whitsunday 1763, she totally refused every kind of food or drink 
Her jaws now became so fast locked, that it was with the greatest 
difficulty her teeth could be opened a little, in order to admit a 
small quantity of gruel or whey ; but of this so much generally re- 
turned, that It was not certain that any had been swallowed. About 
this time, some water was given to her from a noted medicinal spring 
at Braemar, some of which it was attempted to make her swallow, 
but without effect; these attempts were continued, however, f5r three 
mornings, her throat being rubbed with the water, which ran from 
the corners of her mouth. On the third morning, during the 
operation, she cried out " give me some more water," and swallow- 
ed with ease all that remained in the bottle : she spoke no more in- 
telligibly for a year, though she continued to mutter some words, 
which her parents only understood, for fourteen days. She continu- 
ed to reject all kinds of food till July 1765. At this time, her sis- 
ter thought, that by some signs she made, she desired her jaws to 
be opened ; and this being done, not without violence, she called 
intelligibly for drink, and drank with ease about an English pint of 
water. Her father asked her why she did not make some sign when 
she wanted drink  To which she answered, " why should I when 
I have no desire " It was now supposed that she had regained 
the faculty of speech, and her jaws were kept open for about three 
weeks, by means of a wedge ; but this was afterwards remov- 
ed. She still, however, continued sensible, and when her eye- 
lids were opened, knew everybody. By continuing attempts to 
force open her jaws, two of her under fore-teeth were driven out : and 
of this opening her parents endeavoured to avail themselves, by

putting some thin nourishing drink into her mouth, but without 
effect, as it always returned by the corners. Sometimes they 
thrust a httle dough of oatmeal through this gap of the teeth ; 
which she would retain a few seconds, and then return with some- 
thing like a straining to vomit, without a single particle being 
swallowed. Nor was the family sensible of anything like swal- 
lowing for four years, except the small draught of Braemar water, 
and the English pint of common water. In this state she was vi- 
sited, in the month of October 1767, by Dr Mackenzie, a physi- 
cian at New Tarbat ; who communicated, through his brother, the 
Right Honourable James Stewart Mackenzie, Lord Privy- Seal of 
Scotland, an account of her remarkable case to the Royal So- 
ciety, in the Journal of whose Transactions it may be found. 
He found her not at all emaciated ; her knees were bent, and 
the hamstrings so tight that her heels almost touched her but- 
tocks. She slept much, and was very quiet, and when awake, 
kept constantly whimpering, hke a new -born weakly infant. She 
never could remain a moment on her back, but always fell to one 
side or the other; and her chin was put close to her breast, nor , 
could it by force be moved backwards. In October 1772, five 
years after his first visit, the doctor was induced to pay her a se- 
cond, by hearing that she was recovering, and had begun to eat 
and drink. The account given him was most extraordinary ; — 
her parents one day returning from their country labour, having 
left their daughter Janet fixed to the bed as usual, were greatly 
surprised to see her sitting on her hams, on the side of the house 
opposite to her bed- place, spinning with her mother's distaff. All 
the food she took at that time was only a little oat or barley cake, 
crumbled in the palm of her hand, as if to feed a chicken ; she 
put little crumbs of this into the gap of her teeth, rolled them 
about for some time in her mouth, and then sucked out of the palm 
of her hand a small quantity of water, whey, or milk. This was 
only once or twice a-day, and even that by compulsion. She 
never attempted to speak ; her jaws were fast locked, and her eyes 
shut. On opening her eyelids, the balls were found to be turned 
up under the edge of the osfrontis ; her countenance was ghastly, 
and her whole person emaciated. She seemed sensible and trac- 
table in everything except taking food. This she did with the ut- 
most reluctance, and even cried before she yielded. The great 
change to the worse in her looks, Dr Mackenzie attributed to her 
spinning flax on the distaff, which exhausted too much of the sa-

liva, and, therefore, he recommended to her parents to confine 
her totally to the spinning of wool. She was visited again, in the 
year 1775, and found to be greatly improved in her looks, as well 
as in strength. Her food was also increased considerably in quan- 
tity, though even then she did not take more than would be suf- 
ficient to sustain an infant of two years of age. 

This extraordinary woman continued to live to an advanced pe- 
riod of life, taking no nourishment except a little of the thinnest 
gruel, which she received through the aperture which had been 
made by breaking two of her fore-teeth for the purpose of feeding 
her. She died in the year 1796, in the seventieth year of her 
age. 

There is a particular description of her case in the Journal of 
Philosophical Transactions, Vol. Ixvii., Gentleman's Magazine 
for 1778, p. 22, Encyclopaedia Britannica, and Pennant's Tour in 
Scotland ; from which, as well as from authentic private sources of 
information, the above account is taken.

Parochial Registers Sc. — The register of baptisms and mar- 
riages commences about forty-three years ago, the date of the ear- 
liest entry being August 21, 1797, since which period it has 
been regularly kept. It consists of two volumes ; the dates of 
births have not been kept in the first, but commence with the se- 
cond volume, in May 1804. The minutes of the kirk-session 
of Kincardine commence on the t21st of May 1804, when the 
late incumbent, Mr Macbean, was admitted, previous to which no 
session records exist. But they have been very irregularly kept ever 
since then ; entries anything but voluminous, being made only 
occasionally,' and at intervals of sometimes two and three years. 
They have been regularly kept only since the induction of the 
present incumbent in 1821. There is no register of deaths or 
burials. The lay members of session are six in number, all regu- 
larly ordained as elders ; and the parochial schoolmaster is at pre- 
.sent session-clerk. 

Antiquities. — There are several of those round towers called 
dunes in this parish ; regarding the origin of which, it were vain to 
inquire, as there have been so many conflicting opinions upon the 
subject, — some considering them the workmanship of Celtic tribes, 
while others maintain that they were erected by the Danes or 
Norwegians ; but, as Dr Macculloch remarks, " it is indifferent 



418 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



whether we ascribe the structures in question to the Picts or the 
Scandinavians, as there seems little reason to doubt that these 
were radically one and the same people." None of these dunes or 
burghs exist in a perfect form, for they offered too tempting a col- 
lection of stones for modern buildings to be left unmolested ; they 
were not always placed on elevated sites, though in general they 
command an extensive view, and were often built in sight of one 
another. 

In the churchyard, there is a stone about five feet in length 
and two in breadth and thickness ; it is hollow, and divided into 
two cells, one considerably larger than the other. The ends 
and one of the sides are covered with carved figures and hierogly- 
phics ; an imperial crown, and a man on horseback in the act of 
darting a lance or javelin, as also what appears to be a camel, are 
still plainly distinguishable. It is probable that it is the half of a 
sarcophagus or stone-coffin ; and tradition describes it as the tomb 
of a prince of Loellin, who died of his wounds in the neighbour- 
hood, and had his remains deposited there. This sculptured stone 
was examined several years ago by that celebrated antiquary, Dr 
Samuel Hibbert, who took a copy of the inscription upon it. 

There are also several of those circles of stone so frequently 
mentioned by Ossian, which were sacred to Loda, the favourite 
deity of the ancient Scandinavians. 

In building a new wall round the church-yard two years ago, 
there was a small coin of the reign of James VI. discovered, which 
is now in the possession of the writer. It is of silver, and about 
the size of a sixpence. The inscription on the obverse, round the 
royal arms of Scotland, is " jacob : 6. d. g. r. sco :" and on the 
reverse, "oppid : edinb :" surrounding a thistle, surmounted by 
a crown. 

The writer also lately found an antique seal, upon which was 
engraved a lion rampant, the arms of the Rosses. From the place 
where it was discovered, it is plain that it must have lain there for 
many years ; and, indeed, the rudeness of its construction testifies 
its antiquity. 

III. POPULATIONT. 

The earliest census of the population of this parish, so far as is 
now known, is that procured by Dr Webster in the year 1755; the 
number then being 1743. In 1 774, according to the author of the 
former Statistical Account, the population was upwards of 2000 
above seven years of age. But by returns made to Sir John Sinclair, 



KINCARDINE. 



410 



in 1790, there were not above 1600 examinable persons in the pa- 
rish. The chief cause of this great decrease in the space of six- 
teen years was, that, in 1782, many were reduced to poverty by 
the loss of their cattle, and the almost total failure of the crop of 
that year, which occasioned such accumulated distress, that they 
were obliged to remove with their famiUes, and settle in the low 
country as day-labourers or domestic servants.

The population of the parish since the last census has increased 
to 2000. 

No nobility reside within the bounds of this parish, but many 
resort thither during the shooting season, and remain for two or 
three months. There are several respectable farmers, with good 
habitable houses and commodious squares ; and also two gentle- 
men who are large sheep-farmers, viz. Donald Macleod, Esq. 
Gladefield House, and Ebenezer Mackay, Esq. Invercarron, 
House, who farms the estate of Invercarron, the proprietor being 
in India. 

As a proof of the healthiness of the climate, it may be men- 
tioned, that there is at present residing at Culrain, in this parish, 
an old pensioner of the name of Donald Ross, who entered the 
21st, or Royal North British Regiment of Fusileers, in the year 
1760, during the reign of King George II., being then twenty 
years of age. Though he completed his hundredth year last 
spring, this hoary veteran still enjoys pretty good health. 

There are 2 insane, 1 occasionally; 2 fatuous, and also deaf 
and dumb, a brother and sister ; 1 blind, a woman ; and 2 deaf 
and dumb, brothers. 

Language. — The language generally spoken and understood is 
the Gaelic; and though most of the rising generation understand 
English also, yet the Gaelic can scarcely be said to have lost 
ground within the last forty years; as a proof of which, it may be 
mentioned, that, during the summer months, while the day is long, 

 The decrease in the population in 1811 was accounted for by the system which 
had been adopted, some lime before, by proprietors, of turning several small farms 
into one, and depopulating whole straths for the purpose of raising sheep. 



420 



llOSS AND CROMARTY. 



there are two Gaelic discourses and one English every Sunday, 
and the Catechumens are always examined in that language. The 
parish is well supplied with Gaelic Bibles and Psalm-books, every 
family in it being possessed of at least one copy. 

Character, c. — The people here are generally moral in their 
lives, and, when occasion requires, of unremitting industry. In 
common with most Highlanders, they are hospitable, of quick, parts, 
great agility, inquisitive and fond of information, and extremely 
patient under hunger, cold, and other distresses from which their 
southern neighbours would shrink. They still retain a sacred re- 
gard for the clan or family they are sprung from ; but it must be al- 
lowed that this feeling is on the decline. The tale, the song, and 
the dance do not, as in days of yore, entertain the dreary winter 
nights. They are regular in their attendance on Divine worship; 
and in many instances, think nothing of coming ten or twelve miles 
to the parish church every .Sabbath. 

Poaching, c. — Poaching and smuggling may be said to be ex- 
tinct in this district ; though these crimes were once very preva- 
lent, and had so corrupted by their influence the moral character 
of the people, that it was almost impossible to persuade them of 
their guilt. 

IV. — Industry. 
Fisheries. — There are considerable salmon-fisheries carried on, 
chiefly with the coble and net, on the rivers Oidkell and Carron. 
They belong to the Duke of Sutherland, who purchased all the 
fishings in this quarter, a few years ago. The Carron is an excel- 
lent river for angling. The smaller streams and lochs, of which 
last there are a great number in the parish, supply beautiful trout; 
one in particular — Loch Chorrh, in a sequestered situation — con- 
tains trouts of six pounds weight. Flounders are caught in abundance 
below the church of Kincardine at ebb-tide. In the former Statis- 
tical Account, it is related that, during the great scarcity of 1783, 
great shoals of that species of fish, known in England by the name 
of white bait, came up ; and in such astonishing quantities, as 
to contribute very much to the support of many families in this 
and the neighbouring county, in that season of distress. There 
was formerly a yair or stake-net, belohging to Balnagown, in 
which prawns, small rock and ware cod, gurnard, turbot, and 
paddles were caught, and occasionally sturgeon ; of which last there 
was one of the enormous size of 13| feet, taken some years ago. 
The country people think sturgeon of service to their cattle, in

certain diseases, and were used to carry it home and preserve 
t in their houses. But there are no yairs allowed m the FrUh 
1 A. -x proof of the antiquity of salmon-fishmg in this pa- 
Z tit f llow ng is deserving of record : There is a charter 
™ted bv " Wilham, Earl of Ross, Lord of Skie, to h,s well-be- 
Wd brother Hugh Ross of Rarichies," who was afterwards 

led B iX-wl being the first laird thereof of that name 
 the lands of Kilmachalmack in Strathockell, and Carbisd.le n 
Strathcarron, reserving the salmon-fishing of the 11  
to the said Erie and his aires," dated before witnesses Att Du g 
vs-el, 4 of Febrie 1370."- Ancient Charter, and Sir Donald Ilis 
of Lochalsh, " disponed on 3 Novemr 1515 to Hector Munro, 
of Foulis, the salmon-fishing of the Kyle of Ockell. _  

Sheep-farming.Shee-iavmmg was introduced into this parish, 
and the neighbouring one of Creich, by Sir John Lockhart Ross 
of Balnagown, in order to employ his Highland tenants; and he 
had the erection of a village in contemplation. But being called 
to stand forth as a defender of his country's rights, and his sheep 
falling under bad management, he sold off his stock; and at his 
return home, finding himself in the decline of hfe, he dropped his 
favourite idea. Since that period, however, sheep have been intrx,- 
duced in large numbers, and there are at present nearly 30,000 
fleeces of wool shorn annually; but the system of turning whole 
straths, where formerly peaceful cottages were to be seen, into 
sheep-walks, is becoming too prevalent ; and is productive of 
the worst consequences, for every succeeding summer sends the 
finest of our peasantry to a foreign shore, there to seek those 
means of subsistence which are denied them in their father-land. 
These evil consequences have not as yet, we are happy to say, 
been much felt in this parish. 

Advantages.— There are few places better adapted for a manu- 
facturing village than Kincardine. Situated in the near neighbour- 
hood of two great corn counties, it has the advantage of water- 
carriage, and a choice of safe harbours for vessels of fifty tons bur- 
then. ° It lies open to several very populous districts, and were 
manufactures once established it would be resorted to by many. 
The Highland boys and girls are, in the summer and harvest sea- 
sons, employed in herding cattle; and as the range of pasture is 
generally extensive, while tending their cattle, they might earn as 
much by knitting stockings as their parents and full-grown sisters 
at home, by the constant turning of the lint-wheel. 



'''■ ROSS AND CROMARTY. 

Naviation.~~No ships or vessels of any description belong to 
the parish ; but several vessels trade to Bonar, of from thirty to 
sixty tons burthen, and occasionally some of a larger size, thougli 
these last cannot come up to the bridge, owing to the shallowness 
ot the channel. They import coals, lime, meal, salt, &amp;c. and ex- 
port wood, oak bark, corn, wool, and salmon. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means of Communication, 4c.— There is no market-town in 
the parish; the nearest is Tain, which is thirteen miles distant 
from the church of Kincardine. But the means of communica- 
tion are ample : there is a post-office at Bonar Bridge in this parish 
and a daily post. The mail is brought from Tain in a commo- 
dious double-seated gig, capable of containing four passenger, 
which arrives at the Balnagown Arms Inn, Ardgay, every morning 
at nine o'clock, and is despatched at five in the afternoon. The 
mail-coach used to drive round by Bonar, but since May 1830 it 
has crossed the frith at the Meikle Ferry, which is three miles on 
this side of Tain. This ferry, from the shoals in the channel, and 
Its exposure to sudden squalls from the hills, is considered one of 
the most dangerous and inconvenient in the north ; and many lives 
have been lost in crossing it. To avoid this ferry, the Parliamen- 
tary Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in the year 
1812, built an iron bridge at Bonar, across a narrow part of the 
Dornoch Frith where previously there had been a ferry, at an 
expense of L. 14,000. Bonar Bridge consists of three arches,— 
one of cast-iron ] 50 feet in span, and two stone arches of 50 and 
60 feet respectively. The iron arch is on the Sutherland side, 
and the stone arches on this side. The fabric is as strong as it 
is beautiful, for the pillars have repeatedly withstood uninjured 
the shocks of united masses of ice and timber, and the collision of 
small vessels driven against them by the tide. 

There is a good stone pier at Bonar, which was erected a few 
years ago by an enterprising individual in the parish, Mr Ross of 
the Balnagown Arms Inn, solely at his own expense. It is chiefly 
used for shipping timber, and landing coals, lime, &amp;c. or whatever 
cargo the few vessels which occasionally come up the Frith may 
contain. A good many fishing-boats come during the summer 



season. 



'J'he parish is not blessed with the convenience of good roads ; 
for, with the exception of the road from the church of Kincardine 
to Ardgay, Bonar, and a few miles to Gladefield and Invercarron 



KINCARDINE.

Houses, as also that which goes to Croick church, thirteen miles 
distant, the rest of the parish, for upwards of thirty miles, is totally 
destitute of what may be called roads ; the only access to these re- 
mote districts, except on Highland ponies, being by the excellent 
county road on the Sutherland side, which skirts the Kyle, the di- 
vision betwixt the counties, to the extremity of Kincardine, where 
it marches with Assynt. The road to Croick winds through a beau- 
tiful vale, along the banks of the river Carron passing Braelangwell 
Lodge, the picturesque summer residence of Sir Charles Ross of 
Balnagown, and Amat Cottage, the residence of Mr Ross of Pil- 
calnie. 

Ecclesiastical State.— T\iQ parish church is situated within a mile 
of the eastern extremity of the parish : its situation is therefore ex- 
ceedingly inconvenient for the bulk of the population, its distance 
from the western extremity being no less than thirty-four miles. 
It was built in 1799, and affords accommodation for 600 persons ; 
but it is too small for the congregation that usually attend. It is in 
contemplation, however, to add a wing : but a new edifice would be 
found cheaper in the end, as the present one is much decayed, and 
the timber becoming rotten. Its length is 68 feet 6 inches, its 
breadth 20 feet, and its height 17 feet. There is a large and 
well-toned bell attached to the church, which was presented to the 
parish by Admiral Sir John Lockhart Ross. It was a good deal 
injured by fire. 

The sittings in the church have been divided by the heritors 
according to their valued rents, and the tenants on their estates 
have free access to them. There are no seat-rents exacted. 

The manse consists of two erections :— the older part was built 
in 1769; and, in 1827, it was repaired and additions made to it, 

• The following inscription, which was written by Mr Gallie, then minister of 
Kincardine, is on a marble tablet, under the belfry, and within the church :— 

" This Bell, captured in a French Ship of War 

Of 74 Guns, was gifted 
By Admiral Sir John Ross of Balnagown, Bart., 
In the year 1778, 
To the Parish of Kincardine." 



" When Britain's navies did a world control, 
And spread her empire to the farthest pole ; 
High stood our hero in the rolls of fame. 
And Lockhart then became a deathliss name. 
This bell no more shall witness blood or gore, 
Nor shall his voice mix with the cannon's roar ; 
But to Kincardine by the hero given, 
Shall call the sinner to the peace of heaven."

part of the former building being thrown down. Its shape is that 
of a cross, the old house being in the centre. 

The minister's glebe contains about 6 Scotch acres, and has 
been valued at L. 15 per annum. 

The stipend is 17 chalders : at least that quantity was awarded 
by the last augmentation, which took place in the year 1825; 
but from the state of the teinds at present there is a very con- 
siderable deficiency in that amount. The stipend of Kincardine, 
in March 1710, was " four chalders victual, and four hundred 
inerks money, yearlie ;" in 1741, during Mr David Ross's incum- 
bency, L.559, 6s 8d. Scots; in 1770, during Mr Gilbert Robertson's 
incumbency, it was augmented to L. 840 Scots, or L.70 Sterling. 
In 1791, Mr Andrew GaUie, minister, received an augmentation of 
4 chalders victual, one -third bear, two-thirds oatmeal, and L.1, 13s. 
4d. Sterling, makingit in all fourchalders, and L.71, 13s.4d. money. 
In 1807, Mr Alexander Macbean, minister, received an additional 
augmentation of 4 chalders victual, and L. 3, 6s. 8d. Sterling, 
making it 8 chalders, and L. 75 Sterling; and, in 1825, the pre- 
sent incumbent had awarded by decreet of Session, 4 chalders 5 
bolls additional, including the sum of L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion 
elements, which made the stipend 17 chalders in all, as already 
stated. 

Kincardine existed as a parish prior to the Reformation ; and 
from that period till the Revolution the Bishop of Ross was pa- 
tron. The patronage is now possessed by Mackenzie of Cro- 
martie, betwixt whom and the Crown it was disputed for many 
years. The first ecclesiastical notice we possess of Kincardine 
occurs in the " Register of Ministers, Exhorters, and Readers, 
and of their Stipends, 1563 — 1576," which was printed for the 
Maitland Club in 1830, and consists of two parts, or rather two 
separate lists, — the one from 1563 to 1572, and the other from 
1572 to 1576, where, under the head " Ministers in Ross," in 
the first list, is the following ; — 

" Kincardine, Farqukar Iteid, exhortar, xl. merkis, and xx. 

Etherthane. J merkis mair sen Lambmes 1569." 

Ministers of Kincardine. — 1. 3fr Hucheoun Hoss was " minister 
at Kinken in Ross," or " Kincairn," as Kincardine was original- 
ly written, from 1578 down to 1607, — how much later has not 
been ascertained; and he was undoubtedly the first Protestant 
minister settled in the parish.

the " Eminent Men" of this parish. He was " minister at Kincar-

in all probability the immediate successor of Mr Hucheoun Ross. 
He was minister here in the year 1655, Presb. Records of Ding- 
wall, Vol. i.; and appears to have been translated to Tain about 
the year 1664, where he died shortly before the Revolution.

was minister at Eddertoun in the year 1637, and his name appears 
in the " List of Members of the General Assembly, which met at 
Glasgow, Nov. 21, 1638," as one of the Commissioners from the 
Presbytery of Tain, thus,—" M. Hector Monro, min. in Nether 
Tayne." Records of Kirk of Scotland. Mr Monro was " Min. 
at Eddertayne" in 1655, Presbytery Records of Dingwall, Vol. i. 
and was transported to Kincardine about the year 1664, where he 
died, 18th March 1670. 

4. Mr George Ross, was the next " minister at Kincarden." 
He died in February 1683, and was buried in Fearn church-yard. 

5. Mr Kenneth Mackenzie, whose name appears in a " mortifi- 
cation be James Bishop of Ross, with the dean and chapter of the 
Cathedrall Kirk thereof, to the school and schoolmaster of Fort- 
rose," dated at " Fortrose, 21st August 1686 ;" for the " Parsonage 
of Kincardin" formed part of the chapter of Ross, during the time 
of Episcopacy. Mr Mackenzie's subscription to the above document 
is " Ken. M'Kenzie, parson of Kincardin." He was translated to 
Fearn about 1686, having been but a short time minister of Kin- 
cardine. He was deposed soon after the Revolution by the united 
Presbytery of Ross and Sutherland. 

6. Mr Walter Ross, who was also " Episcopall incumbent at 
Kinkardin," previous to the Revolution. He " voluntarily dimit- 
ted" his charge in 1695, and seems to have been a peaceable, 
inoffensive man. The next notice we have of him is in 1704, in 
which year, the General Assembly " recommend to all the Pres- 
bytries within the Synods of Lothian and Tweedale, Glasgow 
and Ayr, and Fife, to collect some charitable supply for Mr Walter 
Ross, late Episcopal minister at Kincardine in Ross." Acts of 
Ass. And the Commission of Assembly, in the year 1714," Payed 
to Mr Walter Ross, 100 lib. Scots, by order of the Church ;" after 
which there is no more mention made of him. 

7. Mr Hector Fraser, sixth minister of the parish, and Jirst 
Presbyterian minister after the Revolution, who was admitted 
here in 1699, the parish having been vacant for four years ; in the

Acts of Assembly for that year, we find the foUowhig mention 
made of him, " Reference to the Commission for plantino- vacant 
kirks in the north, anent Mr Hector Fraser, probationer, having 
the Irish language, his going to the bounds of the Presbytery of 
Ross." After being ten years in Kincardine, Mr Fraser was 
transported to the neighbouring parish of Eddertoun, 4th May 
1709, where he died on the 17th May 1729. 

8. Mr Robert Munro, brother to Mr Hugh Munro, successively 
minister of Tarbat 1699—1701, and Tain 1701—1744. He 
had studied at the University of St Andrews, and was licensed to 
preach by the presbytery of Tain, 1st December 1708 ; he was 
ordained and admitted " minister of Kincarden" on the 29th of 
March 171 1, by Mr Daniel MacgiUigin of Kilmuir-Easter. The 
Rev. Joseph Munro, minister of Eddertoun from 1742 to 1785, 
was his son, and was born in the year 1714. Mr Robert Munro 
died, after a ministry of nearly thirty years, on the 10th of February 
1741 ; and was succeeded by 

9. Mr David Ross, nephew to Mr David Ross, minister of Tar- 
bat 1707 — 1748, who was parochial schoolmaster of Kiss and 
Tarbat successively; to the latter of which he was appointed in 
1732. Having received " an unanimous call from the heritors 
and elders of the parish of Kincarden," Mr Ross was ordained and 
admitted minister there on the 7th April 1742; but died on the 
10th of May following. 

10. Mr Gilbert Robertson. — After studying and taking the usual 
degrees at a Scotch University, Mr Robertson became " itinerant 
ttor to Sir Robert Munro of Foulis's eldest son," afterwards Sir 
Harry Munro, and went with him to the academy of the cele- 
brated Dr Philip Doddridge at Northampton in England, where 
he attended the divinity lectures delivered by Dr Doddridge, and 
received license and ordination from a class of English dissenters 
in that town and neighbourhood, Dr Doddridge being moderator. 
On his return home, he resided at Limlair, in the parish of Kiltearn; 
and in 1740, received a presbyterial call to the church and parish of 
Dingwall, which was, however, rejected by the Commission of As- 
sembly, who declared their dissatisfaction with the presbytery, and 
appointed the moderator to write them a letter to- that effect. His 
admission to Kincardine, which took place 31st August 1742, was 
a very harmonious one, — the petition for him having been signed 
by the whole parish. After an eminently useful ministry of thirty- 
one years, Mr Robertson died on the 17th of March 1774. 

1 1. Mr Andreiv Gallic, who succeeded, was ordained at Nigg 



KINCARDINE. 



42T 



by Mr John Sutherland of Tahi, 27th July 1756, to the mission 

of . On the 6th September 1758, he was admitted to the 

parish of Laggan, in the presbytery of Abertarff; and transported 
to Kincardine, 11th October 1774. Mr Gallie died on the 15th 
of May 1803, in the twenty-ninth year of his ministry here. 

12. Mr Alexander Macbean, who was schoolmaster of Cromarty, 
was ordained and admitted to this parish, 25th April 1804. He 
died on the 21st of August 1820 ; his successor was 

13. Mr Hector Allan, the present incumbent, who is the thir- 
teenth " minister of Kincardine" since the Reformation. Mr Allan 
was ordained to the mission of Fort- William, in Lochaber, in June 
1819 ; and, having " received an unanimous call from the heri- 
tors, elders, and heads of families in the parish of Kincardine," was 
admitted minister there on the 12th of April 1821. 

Government Church at Croick. — There is a Government church 
situated at Croick, in this parish. The church and manse of this 
place, which were completed on the 13th June 1 827, are in a seques- 
tered valley, about twelve miles from Bonar Bridge. Lady Mary 
Ross of Balnagown granted ground for a glebe and garden, the 
extent of which is 6 acres, 3 roods, and 39 falls Scotch land mea- 
sure. The garden has been cultivated and neatly laid out, and 
the glebe has also been enclosed and improved. There were two 
places of worship besides the parish church, previous to the erection 
of the Parhamentary church ; these were twelve miles apart, one 
at Ochto, being fourteen miles from the parish church, and the 
other at Amat, twelve miles. A missionary officiated at them 
once a month, or once in six weeks, as circumstances permitted ; 
his residence was, till lately, in this parish. The proportion of the 
population attached to Croick is 458, the average congregation 
200. A fifth part of the inhabitants of the district are shepherds, 
and the remainder small tenants or cottars. They are generally 
a devout people, and there has been only one instance of theft 
known amongst them since the induction of the minister. There 
is one school, supported by the miuister and people. About 35 
children attend this school at present, the greater proportion of 
whom can read English and Gaelic, write and cipher. 

The first minister appointed to the Parliamentary church of 
Croick, was Mr Robert Williamson, who was ordained and admit- 
ted there, on the 25th September 1828; and by act of Assembly 
1833, "anent Parliamentary Churches and Ministers," he became 
a member of the presbytery of Tain, and had his name added to 
the roll on the 25th September 1833. In 1840, Mr Williamson

was appointed minister of St Andrews Church, Pictou, Nova Sco- 
tia. This church is at present vacant. 

Mission in the heights of the Parish.— The mission of Rosehall, 
which is partly situated in this parish and partly in that of Creich, 
was established by the Committee of the General Assembly for 
managing the Royal Bounty, about the middle of last century : 
it extends over a space about twenty-three miles in length, and 
fifteen in breadth, and consists of two glens and a long strath ; the 
glens are in the west part of the mission, and are separated by a 
lofty hill ; the river Oikell runs through the strath, whence it is 
called Strath Oikell. 

The population is about 1100, and is much scattered, particu- 
larly in the glens, which are chiefly inhabited by shepherds ; the 
bulk of the people are located in small hamlets or farms on both 
sides of the strath. They are all of the Established Church. 
Their moral and religious principles are in general excellent, and 
the Sabbath is well- observed ; they labour under great deficiency 
of the means of education — an evil which the people themselves 
strongly feel, and are most anxious to have remedied. 

The missionary possesses a dwelling-house, cow-house, and 
garden ; the people supply him with fuel, and with provender for 
a cow in winter. The salary was originally L. 20 from the Com- 
mittee, and L. 7 additional from the people ; but it is now L. 60 
per annum ; and the Duke of Sutherland gives L. 5 more, as an 
equivalent for the deficiency of accommodation. 

There is a place of worship at Rosehall, which was repaired in 
1832; and the missionary preaches at Ochto, and Bailephuill, 
the hamlet of the pool, in Glen- Oikell, which are both on the 
Kincardine side of the Kyle ; but there is no church at either of 
these places. Before the erection of the Parliamentary Church 
at Croick, there were three regular preaching stations, viz. Amat 
and Ochto in Kincardine, and Innis-na-lin, the island or plain of 
the nets, in Creich, at which the missionary was obliged to offi- 
ciate in regular rotation; his residence was at Achnnhuagh, the 
field of the graves, in this parish. The church at Rosehall can 
accommodate about 300, but is usually attended by 100 more. 
At Ochto nearly the same number attend, but not' so many at 
Bailephuill. The bulk of the people are within six or seven miles 
of the church, and about the same distance from Ochto. Baile- 
phuill is about seven miles west from Rosehall, but even that sta- 
tion is eight or nine miles from the most remote houses in the 



- KINCARDINE. 



429 



west end of the mission. In dry weather the access to public 
worship is easy, but generally very difficult in winter. 

Baptism is regularly sought and administered; and the comt 
munion is held biennially. A shilling for every sitter is the nomi- 
nal rent, and not easily collected. The collections, averaging 
2s. 6d. weekly, are distributed annually among the poor. 

The principal heritor is Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown ; the 
others are Lord Cranstoun, Mr Munro of Novar, and the Duke 
of Sutherland. 

Rosehall mission-house is thirteen miles from the church of 
Kincardine ; Ochto is about the same distance, and Bailephuill 
twenty-one miles.

1 836. 

Caiechist. — There is one catechist in this parish employed by the 
Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, from whom he re- 
ceives a salary of L.7, 10s. per annum. This class of religious 
instructors are well calculated to be useful to the young, as well 
as to the more advanced parishioners, by examinations on the 
questions of the Shorter Catechism, and by their familiar conver- 
sational explanation of the same. The office of catechist has been 
established here for upwards of a century,— for as far back as the 
year 1730, we find " Donald Ross continued catechist in the par- 
rish of Kincardine, with a salary of L.8 Sterling." Presb. Re- 
cords of Tain, Vol. iv. Donald Ross was " catechist of Kincar- 
dine" in 1770. Vol. X. The present catechist is a venerable 
and intelligent man in the seventy-seventh year of his age. 

There is not a Dissenter of any description resident in this pa- 
rish, and Divine service is always very well attended. 

The number of communicants here is from 70 to 80, of whom 
29 are male heads of families. 

The average amount of church collections yearly for religious 
and charitable objects is from L. 30 to L.35. Such collections 
in a parish which has not a single resident proprietor, shows 
what may be done by the influence of a good understanding be- 
tween a philanthropic pastor and his flock. The collections, 
though rather under the usual average this season, " for religious 
and benevolent purposes," are as follows : For the Jews, L.8, 8s. ; 
India mission, L.4, lOs.; Church Extension, L.4, 4s.; Assembly 
schools, L.3, 5s.; Colonial Society, L.3, 15s.; Inverness Infir- 
mary, L.5 ; total, L. 29, 2s. 

Education. — There are eight schools in this parish, which are all 
well attended. The parochial school is situated near the parish 
church, and is a comfortable dwelling-house. Besides the school 
room, it contains four apartments for the accommodation of the 
schoolmaster. The salary is the maximum, which, with an allow- 



KINCARDINE. 



4.31 



ance for garden of L.2, 2s. Od., makes L.36, 7s. l|d. The school- 
fees scarcely amount to L. 5 annually. The average number of 
scholars attending may be about 60, but in winter they exceed 
100. The branches of instruction taught are reading, writing, 
Latin, arithmetic, and mathematics. Amongst those who have 
held the situation of parochial schoolmaster of Kincardine, since 
its establishment, which took place a century ago, the following de- 
serve to be mentioned : James Dallas, minister of Contin 1793— 
1825; David Garment, who was schoolmaster from 1789 to 1790, 
with a salary of L.5, 6s. 8d., present minister of Rosskeen ; George 
Winehouse, from 1803 to 1805, present minister of Auchterhouse, 
in the presbytery of Dundee; Alexander Ross, from 1822 to 
1829, in which latter year he was ordained by the late Dr 
Mackintosh of Tain, to the " Gaelic and English congregation at 
Dundas in Upper Canada," now Aldborough, presbytery of To- 
ronto ; Charles Laing, from 1829, till his death, which took place 
at Aberdeen, while attending the divinity classes there in 1833; 
and the present " schoolmaster of Kincardine," Henry Macleod, 
who was appointed in 1833. 

There is a school at Strathcarron supported by the Society 
for Propagating Christian Knowledge, who give a salary of L. 15 
per annum. There is also a female school taught on the se- 
cond patent of the same society, with a salary of L.5. Besides 
these endowed schools there are five through different parts of the 
parish, which are supported entirely by individual subscription. 
There are five additional schools required besides the above num- 
ber ; as in several populous districts the children are without the 
benefits of any education whatever. 

Literature. — There was a parochial library established here in 
1823, intended principally as a Sabbath school library ; the works 
contained in it are chiefly, Christian biography, accounts of mis- 
sions, and tracts. 

There was a reading-club also established lately, which pro- 
mises to succeed well. The secretary purchases annually works 
of travels, biography, and general literature, and each member has 
them for about three weeks : at the end of the year, they are sold 
amongst the subscribers. The annual subscription is considerably 
less than a guinea ; the number of subscribers at present amounts 
to sixteen. 

Savings Bank.— A Savings Bank was established this year in 
Tain, and is named " the National Security Savings Bank of 



432 



ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



Easter Ross." The minister of Kincardine is one of the mana- 
gers. 'Ihe lowest deposit is fixed at 2s. 6d., and the highest in one 
year at L. 30 ; the rate of interest being L. 3, 6s. 8d, per cent, 
per annum. It is impossible as yet to say how" this useful insti- 
tution will succeed. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.~The number of individuals who re- 
ceive parochial aid is 75, and the average sum allotted to each 
per annum is 5s. 6d. The amount of contributions for their re- 
lief, arising from church collections, for the year ending 24th No- 
vember 1839, was L. 20, 2s. d. There is a sum of L. 6 Ster- 
ling, given annually for the poor of this parish by Lady Mary 
Ross of Balnagown. Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, Mr Mac- 
kenzie of Cromartie, and the Sutherland family are also mind- 
ful of the poor. To the daily and constant liberality and sym- 
pathy ministered to the needy by the benevolent families at 
Invercarron and Gladefield, this extensive parish is under the 
deepest obligations, as well as to other resident farmers and neigh- 
bours; although the evils of non-residence are at the same time 
deeply felt in many of its districts. 

Fair. — There is one pubhc fair held in this parish, which is call- 
ed " Feille-Edeichan ;" or the market of the quartz-stone. It takes 
place in the last week of November, and sometimes on the first 
week of December ; and continues for three days. There is com- 
monly a fine show of Highland cattle ; and quantities of cheese 
and butter, as well as merchandise, are to be had at it 

Inn. — The only licensed inn in the parish is situated at Ardgay, 
and is conducted in an exceedingly orderly and respectable manner. 

Fuel — The principal fuel used by the lower classes is peats, 
turf, and brushwood. English coals are alvays used by the more 
wealthy portion of the inhabitants. They come by sea to Bonar, 
and are sold at 17s. per ton. 

Ml SCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 

The more striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Ac- 
count, consist chiefly in the improved state of agriculture, and the 

 In the '« Scottish Acts of Parliament," folio edit. 1820, Vol. viii. p. 629, a. d. 
1686, there is the following " Ratification in favours of David Ross of Balnagown, 
of the lands and barony of Balnagown, erecting the village Ardgay into a burgh 
of barony, to be called Bona mess ; and to make burgesses, and to build a uKuket 
cross, and ano Tolbooth ; and nominate and appoint baillies yearly, and to keep and 
hold Courts of Justice ; and hold a weekly market on Friday, and two yearly fairs.

increased facilities of internal communication by roads, convey- 
ances, &amp;c. The wages of labourers, and price of cattle, have also 
increased considerably. At present a boU of oatmeal of the same 
measure as then sells for L. 1, 4s. ; a boll of oats, L. 1 ; and of 
barley, L. 1, 10s. Butter, which was formerly 12s. the Scotch 
stone, and cheese 4s., now bring, respectively, L.l, Is. and 8s. for 
the same quantity. A good ploughman gets from L. 6 to L. 9 a- 
year of wages ; a woman from L. 2 to L. 5 for the same period ; 
and a day-labourer, who used to receive 8d. in summer, and 6d. in 
winter, per diem, will now not be content with less than Is. 6d. or 
2s. This rise in the price of provisions and wages is very striking. 
There has also been a great improvement in the comfort of the 
cottages, and in the dress and habits of the people; and the sys- 
tem of farming in this parish is quite changed, as also the manner 
of letting farms.

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. DONALD GORDON, MINISTER, f 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish derives its name from its situation, being 
surrounded on all sides except the north by hills, and those round 
towers called Dunes or Burghs. The Celtic orthography is Eadar- 
Duin, which signifies between hills or dunes, and the word is com- 
pounded of the preposition eadar, between or betwixt, and dliJi, 
the plural of the substantive dun, a hill or fortified house. Ed- 
dertoun has been written at different periods Edirdoun, Edirdo- 
var, Etherthane, Eddirtayn, and sometimes Nether-tayne. 

Extent — Boundaries. — The parish, which is situated in the 
county of Ross, is 10 miles in length, and about 8 in its greatest

breadth. It is bounded on the east and south by the parishes of 
Tain, Logie-Easter, Kilmuir-Easter, and Rosskeen; on the west, 
by the parish of Kincardine ; and the Dornoch Frith washes its 
coast on the north. 

Topographical Appearances. — The principal expanse of the pa- 
rish, containing most of the arable land, consists of three ledges, 
surrounded by hills,— the Hill of Eddertoun or Cambuscurry 
 Camus-Cari, the harbour of Carius, to the east, Cnoc-an-t~sabh- 
al the hill of the barn to the south ; Muidhe-Bhlarie the 
churn of the plains to the south-west ; and the Hill of Struie 
probably from Struidh, wasting or unproductive, which is just the 
character of the soil, to the west. The first of these, which is 
about 600 feet above the level of the sea, and the last, upwards of 
1000 feet, are within this parish; and the other two, the former 
of which is about the height of Struie, and the latter nearly 300 
feet higher, are, « as wind and water fall," boundaries betwixt 
this and the neighbouring parishes. Between these hills there are, 
together with the frith, six passes; by two of them, towards the 
sea, is the Parliamentary road from Bonar Bridge to Tain ; by 
other two, below Muidhe-Bhlairie, the road from Bonar Bridge to 
Dingwall passes ; the remaining two, hdAvg lorg, a footpath, and 
Strath-rory,  Strath-ruaridh or uaradh, Strath of Roderick or Fox, 
or rather of Water- Spouts, have no roads, though the public ad- 
vantage of a road in both, and especially in the former, has been 
much felt, and generally admitted. A committee of the road- 
trustees of Easter- Ross inspected the ground two years ago, and 
the principal hinderance in carrying this public and important im- 
provement into effect is some difference of opinion about the ex- 
act line which ought to be adopted, — a difference which no doubt 
the intelligent individuals concerned will ere long judiciously ad- 
just for the public good. The lower ledge runs along the whole 
length of the parish, including the shore of the Cambuscurry bay 
eastward, and the Fearns Fedrna, the alder-tree, beyond Struie, 
to the boundary towards Kincardine, westward, and bears evident 
marks, from the character of the soil and other circumstances, of 
having been at one period, though, perhaps, a very remote one, 
under the sea ; accordingly the lower parts are rich alluvial soil, 
excepting near the shore, where it becomes sandy. The second 
ledge, especially on the higher side, is shallow and gravelly ; but 
when properly cultivated it yields in average seasons sure and 

remunerating returns. Within this range there are hundreds of

.ores not worth a penny per annum, which if cultivated -would pay 
o he proprietor at least five per cent, immediately, and at no d 
ant period ten per cent., for outlays judicnously made. The third 
rd hS est ledge contains in many parts, -pecmlly a Ramore 
/saK • the great circle or enclosure, and Little Daan, 
the smaller of the two flats or lower grounds, better 
son for cultivation ; but from its altitude there is such a difference 
f chmate, that it is exposed in no ordinary degree to al the evs 
of late springs and uncertain harvests. In the years 1837 and 
1 838 the tenants there lost almost all their potato crop, and their 
oats were unproductive. 

From the summit of each of the hills mentioned above, the View 
in clear weather is very extensive, picturesque, and interesting. 
The hill of Struie being most accessible from the public road is fre- 
quently ascended for this purpose, and from a pinnacle called he 
Lady's Seat, considerable portions of nine counties are withm the 
ran/e of an ordinary telescope. Beyond Struie, towards Kmcar- 
dine, lies the beautiful and romantic valley of the Fearns ; the 
hills of Corryfearn,, iCoire-fedrna, the glen of the alder tree ; 
Cnoclaffan, the hill of ravines or hollows ; and Garvary, {Garhh- 
'AiridhUe coarse hill pasturage, on the summit of which last 
the parish terminates in that direction; and as these hills rise in 
some parts almost abruptly from the road, the effect is more im- 
posing and impressive. ,  • i -n j ;i 

The shore is sandy, excepting where the Struie hill descends to 
the water's edge, and there it is rocky. Cambuscurry Bay, where a 
Danish invading fleet once anchored, is now not above a fathom 
deep at high water ; and possibly the extent of land recoverable 
would compensate for the expense of shutting out the sea altogether. 
An enterprising gentleman, whose improvements in roads, cultiva- 
tions, &amp;c. are well known, and who possesses extensive estates in 
the county— Mr Ross of Cromarty— it is understood, proposed to 
undertake this task, if the other neighbouring proprietors would 
co-operate. 

Meteorologj.-ln summer Fahrenheit's thermometer averages 
from 57° to 70°, and in winter from 36° to 46°; but in frost, t le 
range is from 20° to 32". It has occasionally, though very rarely, 
been as low as 12", and in February 1837, at eleven v. M., it ac- 
tually fell to 6°. The general range of the barometer is be wixt 
28.5 and 30.5, so that the average may be stated at 29.o. It has 



3 HOSS AND CROMARTY. 

been as high as 30.9, and as low as 27.8; but these are extremes 
which it approaches but seldom. 

From the number and heights of the hills, already described as 
bounding the parish towards the east, south, and west, there falls 
a greater quantity of rain, particularly in the heights of the parish, 
than in any similar extent of Easter Ross. The general tempera- 
lure of the atmosphere is, from the same causes, proportionably 
low. From the nature of the soil, however, this is of much ad- 
vantage to the lower ground, which, to be productive, requires fre- 
quent showers ; and the climate, generally speaking, is favourable 
and healthy. 

It is remarkable how seldom storms of thunder and lightning 
occur, and especially when contrasted with the frequency of such 
phenomena in the neighbouring county of Sutherland. The au- 
rora borealis or polar lights, when visible on the coast of the north- 
ern counties, appear to great advantage in most parts of this pa- 
rish. That rare phenomenon, a lunar iris, was visible here about 
six years ago ; and the beautiful colours of the rainbow, though 
subdued and chastened by the pale light of the moon, were dis- 
tinctly seen ; 

For the gay beams of lightsome day, 
Gild, but to float the rainbow's ray. 

The prevailing and most powerful winds are from the west ; a 
fact mdicated by the inclination of the trees eastward, where the 
soil is light and the locality exposed. The hurricane which blew 
on Christmas-day, 1806, forced in, and totally destroyed two win- 
dows in the western gable of the manse, and otherwise damaged 
the roof, though the house had been built but a few years pre- 
viously. The east wind is, however, very prevalent, and is colder 
and more disagreeable than any other, comparatively sheltered 
as the parish is on the eastward. 

The district may be generally stated as healthy ; and the most 
prevalent distempers, as influenza, bronchitis, pulmonary, rheuma- 
tic, and asthmatic complaints, are often aggravated, but seldom 
occasioned by the climate. Strictly speaking, the diseases caused 
by cold and variable climate are anasarca, dyspepsia, paralysis, 
scrofula, acidity, typhoid fevers, and oedematous swellings of the 
legs. Such cases, however, are rare in this parish, excepting 
dyspepsia and acidity, which are occasioned as much by other 
causes as by that of climate.

the northern coast of the parish, and after passing Bonar Bridge is 
commonly termed the Kyle of Sutherland ; the navigation is quite 
safe for vessels not exceeding 1 00 tons burthen. Springs are nu- 
merous, and some break out quite fresh within high water-mark, 
when the tide, recedes : such as appear throughout the interior of 
the parish are excellent for ordinary use. They are perennial, but 
whether of any peculiar quality is not known, as none of them 
have been analysed. 

There are no lakes or lochs here. The rivers are four in num- 
ber, viz. Eddertoun, Daan, Easter Fearn, and Grugaig, the surly 
stream, and are commonly known by the appellation of burns ; 
in dry weather the flow of water is small, but during heavy rains 
they become suddenly swollen, and rush along with great violence 
and impetousity. On Sunday, 15th September 1839, the bridges 
of Easter Fearn and Grugaig were swept away, and the other two 
so much undermined, that they narrowly escaped a similar fate. 
These bridges have since been rebuilt, but it is a remarkable fact, 
that the old bridge at Easter Fearn, which is situated about 500 
vards further up the river, and is at least half-a-century old, with- 
stood the force of the current, while its more modern neighbour 
gave way, and that it was by it that the public road went, while 
the present bridge, which has only been opened the other day, 
was being rebuilt. The bridge of Eddertoun probably owed its 
escape to its having been very carefully built, as its predecessor 
was carried off in the year 1799, by a flood or speat, which 
rose to such a height, as to enter at the windows of the manse, — 
which was then situated on its banks, and close to the church, — 
destroy much of the minister's furniture, and occasion the aban- 
donment of the house, and removal to its present site. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The rock of Cambuscurry presents 
an extended front of considerable height towards the public road. 
It consists chiefly of red conglomerate sandstone, broken into dis- 
tinct, truncated, and somewhat pyramidal masses ; the fissures run 
from east to west, and the blocks lie at an angle of about 12° 
northward. In the hill of Strui, the strata are of various kinds, 
such as old red sandstone, gneiss, quartz, granite, and whinstone ; 
and the dip averages from 15° to 2.5° towards the north. It is re- 
markable that near the foot of 'this hill, and towards the shore, 
the dip is inward to the south, as if the strata in the valley had 
broken down in the centre. Here, too, the secondary stratified de- 
posits of old red sandstone and conglomerate rise high up on

the sides of the neighbouring gneiss hills ; the upper part gradu- 
ating into calcareo-bituminous slates, and the lower part compos- 
ed of the debris of the neighbouring primary rocks, and generally 
resting unconformably upon them. The aggregate thickness of 
these deposits is enormous, and their original extent was probably 
much greater than at present, as it perhaps once filled up a great 
hollow or trough of the primary rocks. At Meikle Daan, and in 
other places, are quarries of freestone, which are neither easily 
hewn nor durable, from being much impregnated with iron ore- 
At Daan there is -also a bed of limestone of a hard kind, which 
has been occasionally burnt for lime, but was found to be rather 
expensive under ordinary management. The whole of the deeper 
mosses, especially in the heights of the parish, contain, as in al- 
most all the Highlands, trunks and roots of trees, chiefly fir, but 
also oak, hazel, birch, &amp;c. Some of these are of immense size, in- 
dicating the existence of an extensive forest at some period, though 
probably a very remote one. 

Soil. — The soil is various, according to locality, as already stated. 
In the division nearer the sea, the higher parts are gravelly ; next 
comes deep alluvial loam ; and the lowest turns quite sandy. The 
middle division is chiefly gravelly and mossy, with a mixture of clay 
and common soil. The highest is also a varied mixture of clay, 
gravel, moss, and common soil, but is deeper and more easily cul- 
tivated than the middle division of the parish. Cultivation has done 
very much for this parish within the last forty years, so that the 
general aspect is quite changed ; much, however, still remains to 
be done. The principal land-owner. Sir Charles Ross of Balna- 
gown, has been liberal and encouraging to the large farmers on 
his estate ; and is giving considerable quantities of lime to the 
smaller tenants, according to the extent and quality of the lands 
they occupy. Such judicious liberality and kindness, benefiting as 
it does all parties, is worthy alike of commendation and imitation.

Besides the above, we have to notice the game birds which 
frequent this parish. This family, which are classed among the 
Rasores or Gallinaceous birds, are known as the Tetraonidce or 
grouses. Of these we possess two genera, 1. Perdix ; common par- 
tridge, fP. cinerea J. '2. Lag opus ; red grouse or moorfowl, L.

Wood. — At Easter Fearn, there once existed an extensive oak 
and birch wood, which extended from the top of Struie Hill to the 
shore. Tradition relates that the whole was purchased, early in the 
seventeenth century, by two brothers from England, who got it cut 
down and manufactured into charcoal. The place still retains the 
name of Meike Wood, and is now covered with brushwood to a 
considerable extent. At Wester Fearn, on the estate of Balna- 
gown, there is a fine plantation of Scotch fir, chiefly old trees, co- 
vering an extent of nearly 100 acres. At Mid- Fearn, on the Su- 
therland estate, there is a natural wood of birch of 60 acres, and a 
planted wood of fir, birch, oak, &amp;c. of the same extent. There 
was also a fir wood of 78 acres on the hill of Eddertoun, which 
was on the estate of Cadboll, and was sold in 1838 for L.680 
Sterling. It is now nearly cut down, but is to be replanted 
whenever the ground is cleared of the old wood. 

The soil here, in its present state, is best adapted for Scotch 
firs and larches, of which there are considerable plantations in the 
parish, as mentioned above, and two on the Balnagown'property.

Icuid from 1165 to 1214, built a castle at Etherdover, Edirdona, 
oc Edirto,, as a curb upon the turbulent inhabitants of Easter 
Itoss. The situation of this castle or " dune" was near the sea : 
and commanded the ferry betwixt the counties of Ross and Sutherl 
nd.  1 here is mention made of it in the chronicle of Melrose, 
liowers Scotichronicon, and in Macpherson's Geographical Illus- 
trations of Scottish History. 

Mbey of Fearn.-The next event of importance in the history 
of this parish, IS the founding of the Monastery or Abbey of Fearn, 
which took place in the thirteenth century. Ferquhard, Earl of 
Ross, having, about the year 1227, accompanied his sovereign, 
K.ng Alexander 11. to London, challenged a renowned French 
champion, then at the English court, to single combat a r««ranc.; 
and made a vow before entering the lists to found a monastery in his 
ownearldom, if he conquered his antagonist. Itwas very commonfor 
men m that dark and superstitious age to make similar vows, imme- 
diately before engaging in battle or any other hazardous enterprize • 
imagining, no doubt, thereby to interest the Almighty in their 
satety. The Earl of Ross, having vanquished and slain his op- 
ponent set about fulfilling his vow ; and accordingly in travelling 
home he brought from the Priory of Whitehorn, or Candida Casa, 
in Galloway, Malcolm and his brother, two canons of the Candidus 
Ur/ofot the rule of St Augustine; and procuring some of St 
JNmian s relics, founded and endowed an Abbey at Fearn, a place 
situated near the western extremity of this parish, and in the earl- 

and SsensZTfn: f him, places this combat in the year 1277,

dom of Ross. Malcolm of Galloway was appointed by the Earl 
first abbot of the new monastery, about the year 1230 ; and " by 
him the affairs of the abbey were conducted with great piety and 
judgment" until his death, which took place after an incumbency of 
fifteen years ; " he was reverenced as a saint" in the monastery, " on 
account of his virtues." 

Malcolm of Nig succeeded as second Abbot of Fearn about the 
year 1246. In his time the devotions of the church meeting with 
frequent interruption from the ferocity and savageness of the neigh- 
bouring inhabitants, and the situation proving otherwise unsuitable 
to the purpose, Ferquhard, Earl of Ross, with consent of the abbot 
and brethren of the convent, transported the abbey, " for the more 
tranquillity, peace, and quiet thereof," to a place about twelve 
miles south-east of the former situation, where it continued ever 
after. Its new site received the name of Fearn, or, as it was styled 
in ancient charters, " Ahbacia de Nova Farina" in allusion to the" 
place where it was originally situated. Its founder and benefac- 
tor, the Earl of Ross, granted many new privileges, and bestowed

of a warrior, with his arms crossed on his breast, is still pointed out as his. An un- 
successful search was made for his remains 17th September 1819, but was given up, 
after digging to the depth of eight feet. _ j i- •

8. Donald Piply, a canon of Fearn, — " Donaldus Abbas de Nova Farnia," is a

9. Adam Monilaw, who died at Fearn in the year 1407. 

10. Thomas Cattanach, presented by the Prior of Whitehorn, who assumed that 
privilege, but rejected by the convent of Fearn. 

11. Finlay Ferrier, " grandson to Sir William Ferrier, vicar of Tayn," died 1440. 

12. Finlay M'Fead, who was held in great respect, so much so that the king com- 
manded that he and his descendants should bear the name of Fearn as their family 
surname, which was accordingly done. This abbot died 17th March 1483, having 
enjoyed his benifice forty-four years, and was interred in St Michael's aisle, where his 
effigy in full pontificals, with the mitre on his head and crosier by his side, still exists 
in tolerable preservation ; and under it is the following inscription in Saxon charac- 
ters,—" Hie Jacet Finlaius M'Fead, Abbas de Fern, qui obiit anno mcccclxxxv.

14. Andrew Stewart of the house of Inntrmcath, haying acquired possession of 
this abbacy, by a pretended bull from Rome, held it till his death, 17th January 1518. 
He was also Bishop of Caithness, 1490-1518, and Commoiulator of the wealthy Abbey 
of Kelso. Rymer, &amp;c.

numerous muniBcent donations upon it; all which were confirmed 
by his son and successor, William, Earl of Ross, in 1-258. The 
period of the removal of the abbey from this parish must have oc- 
curred betwixt the years 1'246 and 1251 ; as Malcolm of Nigg, in 
whose time the transportation took place, became abbot in the for- 
mer year, and Ferquhard, Earl of Ross, whose death occurred 
in the latter, was living at the time, and very instrumental in the 
removal. 

Eminent Characters.— Amongst the eminent characters of this 
parish, the names of the following individuals deserve to be no- 
ticed : 

Mr John Sutherland.— Mr Sutherland was son of Mr Arthur 
Sutherland, Episcopal incumbent or curate of Eddertoun, from 
1679 to 1708; and at the period of his father's death 8th April 
1708 was very young. He early embraced Presbyterianism, and 
having pursued the usual course of study, preparatory to becom- 

15. Patrick Hamilton, a natural son of the Earl of Arran, received this benefice 
when quite a child, and it is probable never resided at Fearn. He was the first called 
in question for religion at the dawning of the Reformation in Scotland, and having 
been found guilty of thirteen different articles of heresy, was burnt at the gate of St 
Salvators College in St Andrew's, 28th February 1327, at the age of twenty-four— 
Spottiswood, Keith, &amp;c. ° 

16. Donald Dunoon, of the family of Dunoon, of Dunoon, in Argyleshire, suc- 
ceeded Abbot Hamilton in J 528; he was a man of great learning, and died 9th Fe- 
bruary 1340. 

17. Robert Cairncross, Bishop of Ross, 13.39-1545, was appointed Abbot of Fearn, 
upon the king's recommendation to the Pope, as the building was out of repair, and 
the Bishop, a wealthy man, and so in a capacity to restore the edifice. He was Provost 

of Corstorphine, Abbot of Holyroodhouse, and chaplain to King James V Holin- 

shed, Keith, &amp;c. He resigned the abbacy., lat April 1543, and died shortly after.— 
Ep. Reg. Scot. 

18. James Cairncross having thus acquired the benefice by Bishop Cairncross's 
resignation, who was probably his brother or some near relation, enjoyed it only a few 
months, having also resigned that same year. 

19. Nicholas Ross, Provost of the Collegiate Church of Tain, was appointed- in 
1 j46 to the Abbey of Fearn ; but seems to have held it as a secular charge ; for in the 
Parliament of 1560, he sat and voted for the abolition of the Roman Catholic religion 
m Scotland, and was an avowed Protestant. He died at Fearn in 1569. 

20. Thomas Ross of Culnahal, Provost of the Collegiate Church of Tain, and vicar 
of Alness.— He was forced, by troubles and oppression by the neighbouring barons, to 
reside for many years in Forres, during which period he received little or no benefit 
from the revenues of his monastery. Abbot Ross married Isobel, daughter of Alex- 
ander Kinnaird of Cowbin, and dying in 1395, was buried in St Michael's aisle at 
Fearn, 

21. Walter Ross of Morangy, and son of the preceding, was the last commend.itor 
of the Abbey of Fearn. It would apjiear that he was little more than titular abbot 
or commendator, as these titul.ars were called, for in 1597. the lands belonin"- to 
the abbey were erected into a temporal lordship called the Barony of Gcani'eSi'and 
granted by James VI. to Sir Patrick .Murray, who was a great favourite of his ; and 
in the year 1607, all the other lands not contained in that barony were, by act of Par- 
liament, annexed to the bishopric of Ross. VVliethcr Abbot Ross, who was not con. 
suited in making these arbitrary grants, was living at that period, or when he died, is 
not known. Thus this venerable institution, after existing nearly four hundred vears, 
became extinct — Forbes 6n Tithes makes 1617 the date of its annexation to the 
Bishoiiric of Ross.

ino- a candidate for the ministry in the Church of Scotland, was 
licensed by the Presbytery of Dornoch, within whose bounds he 
w-i residino- The parish of Eddertoun becommg vacant about 
this time, by the death of Mr Hector Fraser, his father's imme- 
diate successor, on the 17th of May 17-29, and the patron omitting 
to present any person -within the six months specified by law, the 
" right of planting the said parish" fell into the presbyteries hands 
tanquamjure devoluto; and on the day appointed for moderating 
in a call, it appeared that there were three candidates,— Mr Alex- 
ander Rose, a licentiate of the presbytery of Aberdeen ; Mr John 
Sutherland; and Mr Robert Robertson, minister of Loth, in the 
county of Sutherland,— a considerable number of the heritors, el- 
ders, and heads of families in the parish voting for each. After a 
variety of procedure, unnecessary to be recited here, a Presbyterial 
call was given to Mr Robertson, on the 16th April 1730. 

Though Mr Sutherland was not the successful candidate for 
Eddertoun, yet his character as a preacher was so high, that in 
a few months afterwards he received a call to another parish, 
—Golspie in Sutherlandshire,— and was ordained and admit- 
ted there 30th April 1731. That parish was for some time 
before the year 1688 a sanctuary, by means of the family of 
Sutherland's steady adherence to the interests of religion, and re- 
sidence in the parish, to sundry eminent individuals persecuted from 
a neighbouring county, for their non-compliance with the imposi- 
tions of the times. These refugees might with safety have returned 
to their native county immediately after the Revolution, yet such 
was their gratitude to the above-mentioned noble family, that they 
chose rather to spend the remainder of their days in their respec- 
tive callings, under the wings that covered them in their distress. 
During the forty years' ministry of Mr Walter Denune, Mr Su- 
therland's immediate predecessor, religion flourished in the pa- 
rish. Mr Denune had himself, previous to his settlement there,

suffered considerably for non-conformity during the period be- 
twixt the Restoration and Revolution, as related in Wodrow's 
History. At Mr Sutherland's admission to Golspie, in 1731, 
there was a considerable number of devout Christians in the place,' 
some of them being the posterity of these refugees ; but during 
the period betwixt the years 1731 and 1744, nothing remarkable 
occurred under his ministrations, till in November of the latter 
year, when there was a considerable awakening and revival of re- 
ligion, which extended through the parish. There is a full ac- 
count of it given in a letter from Mr Sutherland, dated « Golspy, 
August 8, 1745," and addressed to Mr Robe of Kilsyth, by whom 
it was published in his " Monthly History" for 1745, No. 5, p. 
130, and also in « Gillies's Collections," Vol. ii. p. 387. Afte'r a 
ministry of twenty-one years in Golspie, Mr Sutherland was 
translated to the town and parish of Tain, and admitted there 29th 
July 1752. He died at Tain on the 25th November 1769, in 
the thirty-ninth year of his ministry. Mr Sutherland, who was 
twice married, left a numerous family. His eldest son, William, 
born 27th January 1738, was minister of the parish of Wick, in 

Caithness, for a period of fifty years, 1765 1815, 

Alexander Ross Oag — At the period of Mr Robertson's admis- 
sion to this parish in 1730, there lived an aged Christian, named 
Alexander Ross Oag, or Young a very common patronymic when 
the father and son were of the same name; a man in indigent cir- 
cumstances, and without the advantages of education, but of such- 
uncommon natural talents, combined with fervent piety and Christ- 
ian simplicity, that numerous anecdotes, well authenticated, il- 
lustrative of his eminent character, and the estimation in which he 
was held, especially by the religious public, are still related 
throughout the northern counties. 

One instance may be recorded exemplifying his coniidence in die providential 
government of God. A sturdy beggar, one of a class very numerous at that period, 
came to his house late one evening, and asked for a night's lodging. Alexander met 
the man at the door, and expressed his willingness to receive him, excepting for his 
Ignorance of the man's character for honesty, stating that he was a weaver by trade, 
and must be careful of the property belonging to other people which was urider his 
charge. The gaberlunzie-man" protested in the most solemn manner as to his 
honesty and principles, appealing at the same time to the Divine Omniscience as his 
•witness and surety  " Your surety is accepted, and you are welcome to such enter- 
tamment as I can afford," was the reply. Here the " gudewife," who was of quite a 
different stamp,_being a bold, irreligious, worldly woman,_interfered, upbraid- 
ing her husband for his simplicity, and neglect of his temporal interests, in admitting 
a perfect stranger on such pretences. Here the beggar again protested, to quiet the 
fears and suspicions of his hostess, and the worthy master of the house repeated his 
entire satisfaction with the assurances given. 
The beggar, discovering the character of his host, endeavoured to the best of his

Though this individual, obscure and unnoticed in all worldly 
respectshas entered " the land of forgetfulness" upwards of a cen- 
tury ago, such is the veneration and respect in which his memory is 
still held in this parish, that there are several individuals living who 
were named after him, and even within the last three years there 
has been one added to the number. It was lately proposed to 
erect a monument to Alexander Oag's memory in the churchyard 
here, where a flat stone marks the place of his interment ; but this 
proposal, though not abandoned, has not yet been carried into 

Land-owners.— Charles William Augustus Ross of Balna- 
gown, Bart.; His Grace George Granville Sutherland, Duke of 
Sutherland, K. G. ; and Robert Bruce neas Macleod, Esq. of 
Cadboll, are the land-owners in this parish : all of them being pro- 
prietors of land upwards of the yearly value of L. 50, and non- 
resident. 

The following is the present valuation of their respective estates 
in the parish of Eddertoun : — Balnagown, L.1138; Sutherland, 
L.320 ; Cadboll, L.70, 10s. 

Estate of Balnagown.— The lands of Balnagown in this and the 
neighbouring parish of Kincardine have been in the possession of 

abilities to lead the conversation to religious subjects, and thus occupied the time 
till he retired to rest. The wife, however, less satisfied with the honesty oi her 
ffuest than her unsuspicious husband, rose at an early hour on the following morn- 
ing, and immediately went to her lodger's apartment to see if all was safe; but what 
w£ her alarm on finding the beggar gone, and one of the most valuable webs of cloth 
in the house carried off The first expression of her feelings was to attack.Alexan- 
der, for his imprudence in admitting the beggar contrary to her express desire ; but 
his calm and cool rejoinder was, " I appeal to the sureUj." The beggar, on starting 
from Alexander's house with his ill-gotten booty, at an hour before sunrise, made the 
best of his way towards Alness, over what was then a trackless moor, many miles m 
extent ; but being overtaken by a dense mist, it was a morning in the " soute sea- 
son," he wandered about the whole day, without a glimmer of sunshine, or a path 
which might guide him to a human habitation. At length, soon after nightfall, he 
observed a feeble rush-ligl\t at a short distance, and, overjoyed at the prospect of shel- 
ter, food, and rest, exerted his sinking energies, and reached the door of the cottage, 
at which he knocked several times. A voice which seemed familiar to him inquired 
from within " Who is there " To which the weary traveller replied, " A perishing 
man, who seeks admission in the name of mercy " Upon this the door was opened, 
and the beggar, sinking under fatigue and the weight of his burden, threw himself 
down near the fire, and, with a groan, looked around to see where he was, and what 
reception he was likely to get from the inmates. The " gudemau of the house" now 
came forward, after closing the door, to untie the stranger's burden, which seemecl to 
oppress him with its weight, and administer consolation to his drooping spirits when 
he was startled by the shrill voice of his wife exclaiming, " turn out the thieving 
villain, or he'll be making off with more of your webs, I'se warrant.' -- • JNo, icg- 
gy," was the reply, " our property is sent back by the Surety, and for His sake the 
poor man shall be sheltered and entertained this night too." ... 

Tlie incident was made the occasion of imparting reproof and Christian instruction 
by Alexander Oag to the poor beggar, who was deeply affected, and it is said perma- 
nently benefited under circumstances so remarkable.

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



the family of Ross from remote antiquity, as may be seen I'n 
the account of the Abbey of Fearn in this parish, towards the 
begmning of the thirteenth century. But on the decay of that 
monastic institution after the Reformation, the lairds of Balna- 
govyn seem to have been resuming the grants of land, &amp;c., which 
their ancestors, the Earls of Ross, had been bestowing with so 
liberal a hand upon the abbey ; for we find that in the year 1580, 
on the demission of Robert Colvil, prebendary of Cambuscurry, 
which was in this parish, Alexander Ross of Balnagown got a 
grant from the crown of that prebend for seven years, for the 
maintenance of his son, Malcolm, at school ; and by its becoming 
afterwards the property of another son of Balnagown, it would ap° 
pear that he got a perpetual grant of it. In 1601, a charter was 
granted by Sir Patrick Murray, to George Ross of Balnagown, and 
his heirs and assignees, of " the lands of Wester- Fearn, Downy, 
fishings of Bonar, lands of Easter and Wester Drum of Fearn, 
with the half of the manor-place and gardens of Fearn, commonly 
called the monastery of Fearn," &amp;c.; the other half of the abbey 
lands, possessed by Sir Patrick, fell to the share of Sir William 
Sinclair of Mey, son-in-law to Balnagown. The other lands be- 
longing to the abbey not contained in the above grant were an- 
nexed to the bishopric of Ross, in the year 1607; and in 1609, 
David Lindsay, Bishop of Ross, grants a charter to George Ross, 
of the " Kirkton of Kincardin, lands of Ardgay, Eddertown," &amp;c. 
From this it would appear that the revenues of the monastery were 
very great, when it was in the full possession of the rents of these 
lands; but at the time of the Reformation its revenues musi have 
been considerably diminished; for as early as the time of Abbot 
M'Fead, or, as he was frequently called, Abbot Fearn, who ruled 
the monastery from 1440 to 1485, certain farms belonging to the 
abbey were feued off to the friends and relatives of the abbots 
and commendators as the titular Protestant abbots of monaste- 
ries were commonly called after the Reformation ; and every 
succeeding incumbent appears to have followed the same perni- 
cious example, until the evil became past remedy.f 

In 1597, the Abbacy of Fearn was erected into a barony, called the " Barony 
of Geanies," and given by King .Tames VI. to Sir Patrick as mtntioned in the ac- 
count of the " Abbey of Fearn,"; but this grant did not prove a very advantageous 
one, for the whole of the lands contained in it, having been cither violently or by feus 
from the latter Abbots, kept possession of by the neighbouring gentlemen, he found 
It so difficult to recover them, that he accepted 18,000 merks Scots from the Laird 
of Balnagown, and his son-in-law, Sinclair of Mey, for the whole barony. Ancient 
Charters, &amp;c.

The baronry of Westray is entailed property; but the small es- 
tates of Meikle and Little Daan, which also belong to the Balna- 
gown family, and were acquired by purchase, the former in the 
last century, and the other in the present, are both unentailed. 
Meikle Daan originally belonged to the family of Fodis; a char- 
ter and disposition of those lands having been granted by Hector 
Munro, twenty-second Baron of Foulis, in August 1601, to « An- 
drew Munro, his youngest brother-german," to hold of the said 
Hector Munro of Foulis and his descendants, on payment of a feu- 
duty of " X. merkis Scottis yearlie." 

Estate of Sutherlaiid.— The estates in this parish belonging to 
the Duke of Sutherland were acquired by purchase in 1832, from 
Murdo Mackenzie, Esq. of Ardross, who had inherited them from , 
his maternal ancestors. Easter Frn, which is a part of them, 
was originally in the possession of a family of the name of Ross. 

Estate of Cadboll— The Estate of Upper Eddertoun was ac- 
quired by Roderick Macleod of Cadboll, in the year 1729, on 
the death of neas Macleod of Cambuscurry, without heirs-male, 
as « heir of tailzie of the foresaid lands of Upper Eddertoun." 

The land-owners of this parish were more numerous about a 
century ago than at present. The following are their names, with 
their respective valuations, in the year 1745 : —

Parochial Registers, -c— The register of births, baptisms, and 

facts --The descendants, collaterly, of Abbot Fearn were very numerous, David 
Fearn of Tarlogie, and Andrew Fearn of Pitcallion or Pitculzean, both claimed to 
be related to him, and both their properties having been original y "Abbey. lands, 
Abbot Dunoon 1528-1540, feued off the Barony of Cadboll, in 1534, to his nephew, 
Andrew Dunoon, in whose family it continued till it was lost in supporting the cause 
of the unfortunate King Charles " the martyr." Dunoon of Pitogjirty, and Sir An- 
drew Dunoon were alo of this family. In 1559, Mr Robert Melville, Prebend of 
Tain and Chaplain of Tarlogie, granted a " charter of °f ''"tn 

Tarlogie to George Munro of Dalcastle, with consent of Mr Nicholas Ro s, Com- 
mendator of Fearn." 1346-1569. Abbots Nicholas and Thomas Ross 1569- .95 
were compelled by the powerful neighbouring barons to give grants of the lands be- 
longing to the monastery. This oppression reduced the latter peison.e o grca 
straits as related in the " Catalogue of \bbots." And, to conclude, " Walte Ross 
of Morangy, the last Commcndator of the Abbacy of K;avn, procure, a grant in his

marnages, commences 25th July 1799, and has been regularly 
kept smce that period, previous to which nothing of the kind ex- 
isted. It is contained in one volume. The session records only 
began to be kept by the late incumbent ; the first entry being 
dated 26th September 1821. They consist of minutes of the 
proceedings of the kirk-session, poor'.s funds, &amp;c. There is no 
register of deaths kept. 

The kirk-session of the parish consists of ten members, all re- 
gularly ordained elders. The session-clerk at present is Mr Wat- 
son, the parochial schoolmaster. 

Antiquities.— Dunes.— There is a complete chain of those 
round towers called Dunes surrounding this parish ; none of them, 
however, in a state of even tolerable preservation. One of these, 
situated at Easter Fearn, and known by the name of Dune-Allis- 
caig, from Dun-fair-loisgeadli, or the beacon watch-tower, was 
about fourteen feet in height within the last thirty years, and had 
vaults and a spiral staircase within the wall. This interesting speci- 
men of a Teutonic fortress was entirely destroyed about 1818, by 
the materials of which it consisted being used for building dikes and 
farm-houses at Easter Fearn, so that scarcely a vestige is now to 
be seen. 

Sculptured Stones. —Theve are several of these stones here. 
One behind the school-house, which is ten feet in height above 
ground, and tapers to a point at top, the breadth at the bottom 
being about four feet. This obelisk, which is of rough unhewn 
whinstone, has what seems to be a salmon sculptured very cor- 
rectly on the north side, and below that two concentric circles, 
the one three inches below the other, but joined together and con- 
nected with the fish by a triangle running through this joining. 
These hieroglyphics, which perhaps allude to the circumstance of 
the chief who is interred under the stone, being one of the Vikingr, 
or sea-kings of the middle-ages, are executed with great delicacy 
and beauty. There is a circle surrounding the obelisk, at the 
distance of three yards from it as the radius, and two feet in height 
above the surrounding plain ; and the local tradition is, that a 
battle was fought in this place betwixt the inhabitants of the coun- 
try and a party of invading Norwegian pirates, in which the latter 
were defeated with the loss of their leader. Prince Carius, who 
was interred on this eminence, and the above-mentioned obelisk 
erected over him ; accordingly, the name of the place to this day 
is Carry Blair, or the battle-field of Carius.

There is another sculptured stone in the church-yard, with a 
warrior on horseback in the lower compartment, and a large cross 
engraved above it; on the other side there are a number of cu- 
rious circles and hieroglyphics, arranged in an indescribable manner. 

In the old mansion-house of Meikle Daan, there is, above the 
fire-place of the principal apartment, a yellow stone, 3 feet 4 inches 
long, and 1 foot 7 inches broad, with three circles 16 inches in 
diameter. Above the middle circle, and betwixt it and the others, 
are the following initials, A. M. M". F. 1680 ; and below, the 
motto, Soli • Deo • Gloria . There is in the middle circle a man in 
what seems to be a Geneva hat, cloak, and band, with the long 
peaked beard and mustachios of the seventeenth century, holding 
an open book in his right hand, in which is written " Fear • God • 
in • hairt ■ as • ye ' my • be • bsd." Surrounding this effigy, of 
what is in all probabiUty a clergyman, are the following motto and 
initials, " Servire • Deum • est • regnare • M. H. M. E. R." 
In the circle to the right are three lions rampant in an escutcheon, 
surrounded by the motto, " Nobilis  Est  Ira • Leonis ;" and 
in the left circle an eagle, also in an escutcheon, and " Aquila • 
lion • captat • muscas."

In 1753, the amount of population by return to Dr Webster was 780

Language. — The language generally spoken is Gaelic ; and 
though the inhabitants speak English less or more perfectly, and are 
desirous to give an English education to their children, the Gaelic 
language has lost scarcely any ground within the last forty years. 

Character and Habits of the People. — The habits of the people 
are cleanly, and their style and manner of dress conformable to 
what prevails among people of the same rank, and in the same 
circumstances, in the vicinity. With few exceptions, they retain 
the characteristics of the Gael, being patient under adverse cir- 
cumstances, and, though not disposed to endure constant toil, re- 
solute in every effort to better their condition and maintain their 
independence ; they arc, consequently, industrious, and contented 
under many privations and trials. They are also intelligent,

moral, and religious ; and while the duty of family visitation has 
been observed at stated periods, that of catechising the whole pa- 
rish is performed annually. There is an efficient kirk-session of 
pious and active elders, and the neglect of family worship is 
scarcely known in the parish. That instances of immorality occa- 
sionally occur, does not detract from the general character of the 
people, or sanction the imputation of that which is the very oppo- 
site, though such methods of generalizing have been frequently 
adopted, to the prejudice both of truth and of reputation ; how 
unjust and illogical, for instance, to brand the religion of a whole 
district, as favouring fanciful and perverse views of the holy Scrip- 
tures and sacraments, because certain individuals were justly or 
unjustly charged with such principles and conduct. Or supposing 
cases of petty theft to occur, or instances be known of persons ad- 
mitting the possibility of chasms or superstitious observances hav- 
ing some good or evil effect, — the former, a crime rarely known 
among true Highlanders, and the latter now rapidly disappearing, — 
would it not be gross injustice to distinguish the one people as 
thieves, and the other as grossly superstitious  

Perhaps in no part of Scotland have the ministrations of the 
Gospel been continued in greater purity and faithfulness for the 
last century and a half, than in the county of Ross, and especial- 
ly in the district of East Ross. Still, however, as might be ex- 
pected, the power of vital godliness has not been uniform among 
its inhabitants, either in extent or degree ; moral conduct and the 
decencies of religious habits were always observed, but Christians 
of talent, piety, and influence were becoming gradually few. This 
was for some time past a matter of deep concern to ministers and 
people, when they reflected on the number and eminence of the 
witnesses removed by death, and the comparative fewness of those 
raised up to fill their places. Various means, and especially that 
of prayer-meetings, in parishes and among ministers, were em-" 
ployed, and increasing attention and seriousness were observable, 
particularly on occasions of the celebration of the communion 
sacrament, for the last two or three years ; but nothing remark- 
able occurred till under the evening address of the excellent 
Mr Macdonald of Urquhart, on the communion Sabbath, at 
Tarbat, 3th July 1840, and again on MondJiy following, when 
there was an unusual impression and awakening over the whole 
congregation. The same pervading influence has rapidly ex- 
tended over the neighbouring parishes of Tain, Eddertoun, Lo-

gie-Easter, Kilmiiir-Easter, Alness, Urqubart, Kirkmichael, and 
others. The plainest sermons are often accompanied by the 
most extraordinary effects ; and in all the above-mentioned pa- 
rishes, there are one or more week-day evening sermons and prayer- 
meetings in church ; and the anxiety to attend on every such oc- 
casion continues unabated among the great body of the people. 
Congregations which formerly would appear to great advantage, 
when contrasted with others, throughout any part of the country, 
south or north, in respect to attendance on Divine service, and 
orderly demeanour during public worship, appear now quite altered, 

while many of those once comparatively careless are awakened to 

a deep and abiding concern. It is premature to judge as to the sav- 
ing effects on individual cases; but there can be little doubt, that 
the work is of Divine origin, and of a saving and permanent cha- 
racter already in many instances. 

This parish also shared in the benefits of a revival of religion, 
which took place towards the beginning of last century. 

Poaching, even in olden times, was rare ; and smuggling has 
been extinct since the commencement of this century, to the marked 
benefit, temporal and spiritual, of the inhabitants of this parish. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — It is impossible to give the exact number of acres 
in this parish, as there has been no survey taken of the Balnagown 
estates — the largest in the parish — for inany years, the last being 
in 1 808 ; and the many changes which have taken place since that 
period, especially in cultivation and tillage of the different farms 
on that estate, make it quite unnecessary and useless to give the 
measurement then taken. Even the total number of acres is unat- 
tainable'at present, as large tracts of moor-land and hill pasturage 
■ seem to have been left unsurveyed. 

The rental of the Balnagown estates here is as follows :

ROSS AND CROMARTY 



The present enterprising farmer of the Sutherland estates in 
this parish— Donald Macleod, Esq. Gladefield House, Kincar- 
dine—has greatly improved the property since the year 1835, hav- 
ing added about 60 acres to the arable land, which was then but 
inferior pasturage, covered with broom and whins. He was also 
at the expense of building 8135 yards of substantial stone dikes, 
3310 yards of covered drains in improved land, and of cutting 
12,720 yards of hill or sheep drains. These extensive outlays" 
amounting to some thousand pounds, and which no doubt will be 
suitably remunerated by a landlord of wealth and distinguished 
liberality to his tenants, have, with other improvements, increased 
the annual value at least L.70 beyond what it was when the pro- 
perty was acquired.

cut down, but is to be replanted. 

Balblair Distillery. ~T\\eve is a whisky distillery situated at 
Balblair, in this parish, which was established about forty years 
ago, and was the first in this part of the country. It distils week- 
ly 120 bushels of malt, which should give about two gallons of 
whisky each ; the price averages 9s. 6d. per gallon ; and they are 
permitted to sell at three strengths,— 1 1 under proof, U. P. 
II and 25 over-proof, O. P. but the last is rarely, if ever, re- 
quired or made. 

The flavour and quality of these spirits is pronounced unequal- 
led by connoisseurs in such matters ; perhaps this may arise from 
the use of peats as fuel, and other secrets of distillation acquired 
from the old smugglers. The repute of this distillery has no 
doubt been considerably enhanced by the estimation in which the 
late Mr John Ross, who commenced it, was held by all his nume- 
rous acquaintances. 

He was a man of most benevolent dispositions, Christian prin- 
ciples, and strict attention to business. 

V. — Parochial Economy, 

Means of Communication. — There is no market-town or village 
in the parish ; the post-town, which is five miles from the manse, 



EDDERTOUN. 



being Tain. The mail-gig, which runs betwixt that town and 
Bonar Bridge, passes here at 8 a. m. going to Kincardine, and at 
6 p. M. on its return to Tain. 

There is a good harbour at Ardmore, capable of accommodat- 
ing vessels of 1 50 tons burthen ; and during the summer season, a 
considerable number of schooners and smacks, and sometimes a 
brig, arrive there, with cargoes of coals, lime, &amp;c. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated about a mile 
and a half from the eastern extremity of the parish, and eight 
from the western extremity towards Kincardine, which is marked 
by an immense rock of grey whinstone, extending from the public 
road to the sea, at a place called Ardcronie. It is exactly a mile 
from the manse, and is very inconveniently situated for the inha- 
bitants, on account of the distance the greater part of them have 
to come. There are two dates on the church, " 1743," being that 
on the west, and " 1794," that on the east gable ; the former is 
the date of its original erection, and the other of the last re- 
pair of any consequence which it received. Its length is 55 
feet, breadth 18, and height of ceiling 7 feet from gallery, and 
under gallery, 6 feet 3 inches, — the walls being only 10 feet high 
outside, and passages and floor sunk two feet. All the seats, ex- 
cepting about half-a-dozen, are too narrow from back to front, 
many being only 21 inches, while the legal minimum width is 27 
inches. The roof and galleries are much decayed, the west one 
being supported by props, the front gallery so ill constructed as 
to be but seven feet from the pulpit, and there are several rents in 
the back wall. In conclusion, the church is ill lighted and venti- 
lated, and is situated in such a low damp place, that the floor is 
frequently flooded ; so that, on the whole, it is perhaps the worst 
constructed, and most uncomfortable place of worship in the 
county. 

The church seats are all free, and have never been divided by 
the heritors of the parish. They accommodate from 400 to 
500 persons, though, if the legal seat-room were exacted, the 
number would not exceed 800, — very inadequate accommodation 
for the population. 

The manse, which was originally close to the church, and had 
to be removed on account of a destructive inundation of the river, 
was built in its present situation in the year 1799; and received 
a considerable repair in 1838, — several small additions which con- 
tribute ipuch to the comfort of the house, being then erected. A 
new set ofsoflices was also built at that time.

The glebe was originally designed, as the fixing of its limits is 
technically termed, on 3d July 1729, after a tedious and expen- 
sive process, which cost the incumbent, Mr Hector Fraser, up- 
wards of L, 1000 Scots, a large sum in those days, and the be- 
nefit of which he never reaped, having been removed by death in 
the month of May preceding ; but the situation proved so incon- 
venient by its distance from the manse, that it was never taken 
possession of by the succeeding ministers, and remained in the 
hands of the proprietor, who paid rent for it, and provided them 
with a farm ; until 6th June 1838, when an excambion took place, 
and the former glebe having been perhaps the best land in the pa- 
rish, and the soil of a deep loam, quantity was on this occasion 
given for quality. The extent of the present glebe is as follows, 
being the measurement taken by Gregory Burnett, Esq. land-sur- 
veyor, Ardross:

Total contents of glebe of Eddertoun, 41 acres, 34 falls imperial measure. 

The place where the glebe is now was, at no very distant pe- 
riod, a broom-moor, which its name signified in Gaelic, Fon7i- 
bhealaid/i, or the district of broom ; but it is capable of much im- 
provement, and a consequent increase of value. At present the 
value, including garden, is about L.16 per annum. 

The stipend is fifteen chalders, half meal, half barley, Linlith- 
gow measure, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling for communion elements. 
The last augmentation which raised it to that having been awarded 
in June 1839, the modification took place 20th February previ- 
ously. There is, however, a deficiency of eight bolls in the above 
at present, according to the interim locality. The annual value 
of the stipend of Eddertoun may therefore be estimated at L. 230. 

Before the period of the Reformation, the sub- deanery of Ross 
" consisted of the two kirks of Tayn and Eddertayn, and the rental 
was L. 200, 6s. 8d. Scots," MS. in Advocates' Library, and this 
had probably been the case since Popery became the established 
religion of Scotland. There is a tradition in the parish, that the 
only copy of the Scriptures in use here, during Popish times, was 
a large parchment scroll, which was chained to the pulpit. In the 
list of parsonages in Scotland in 1562, given in he History of 
the Affairs of Church and State in Scotland, by the Right Rev. 
Bishop Keith, the name of " Eddirtoun" occurs.

their Stipends, soon after the Reformation, which exists in ma- 
nuscript in the Advocates' Library, there isthe following notice 
of this and the neighbouring parish of Kincardine : — " Kincardin 
— Etherthane. Farquhar Reid, exhortar, xl merkis, and xx 
merkis mair sen Lambmes 1569." From which it would appear 
that these two parishes were under the ecclesiastical charge and 
inspection of only one exhorter, the difficulty of getting Protestant 
ministers to supply parishes being very great at that remote period, 
when the nation was just emerging from Popery. The next ec- 
clesiastical notice of Eddertoun occurs in the Register of Assig- 
nations of Ministers' Stipends for 1576, MS. in Register Office, 
Edinburgh, as follows : — " Eddirtayn ; Donald Symsoun, reidare 
at Eddertayn, his stipend xx merkis, with the kirk land thairof," 
&amp;c. 

From 1576 to 1638, a period of sixty-two years, there is no- 
thing known regarding the ecclesiastical history of this parish ; 
but since the latter year there is a complete succession of parish 
ministers preserved. 

Ministeis of Eddertoun. — 1. Mr Hector Monro, whose name 
occurs in the list of members of the famous General Assembly 
which met at Glasgow, '21st November 1638, as one of the com- 
missioners from the Presbytery of Tayn ; thus, " M. Hector Mon- 
ro, min. in Nether Taine." Mr Monro was second son of Mr 
William Monro, parson of Coulecudden in Cromartyshire, about 
the end of the sixteenth, or rather beginning of the seventeenth 
century, and was proprietor of the small estate of Daan, in this 
parish, which descended to his son. He was translated to the 
parish of Kincardine about the year 1665, and appears to have 
either conformed, to Episcopacy, or been one of the indulged 
Presbyterian clergymen of that period. 

Mr William Ross, — who succeeded, was Rector of Eddertoun 

• The parson, of Cullicudden was nephew of Mr Donald or John as it occurs in 
some places, Munro, " Hugh Dean of the Isles," or Archdeacon of that diocese, 
" Superintendant of Ross, and minister of Kiltearn," who travelled through the most 
of these districts in the year 1549, and wrote an interesting account of them in the 
Scottish dialect and orthography, the greatest part of which Buchanan adopted in 
his History of Scotland. He was appointed at the Reformation, " Commissioner to 
plant kirkis in Ross, and to assist the Bischope of Cailness Robert Stewart, Earl 
of March, who was, however, not in priest's orders, in semlable planting, to begyn 
at Lambmes 1563, stipend iiijc 400 merkis." The eldest son of the parson of 
Cullicudden was Mr Robert Monro of Coull, tninister of Kiltearn, and thereafter in 
Strathnaver, and by his wife, Isobcll Thorntown, daughter of the Laird of Dalgelly, 
had two other sons and a daughter. The family were cadets of the Munros of Fou- 
lis, being descended from George, thirtecnlli Baron of Koulis, 1425-1452, ;uid 
seem to have always had some of their sons in the church.

about fourteen years. He died in 1679, and a tombstone in this 
churchyard marks the place of his interment. 

Mr Arthur Sutherland,— \\\o was the last Episcopal incumbent 
or curate here, succeeded, and at the Revolution was allowed to 
remam in possession of his church, manse, and stipend, upon tak- 
ing the oath of allegiance to the existing powers. Accordingly, 
he continued to preach, &amp;c. undisturbed, though he never con- 
formed to the Presbyterian form of church-government, until the 
period of his death, which took place 8th April 1708. Mr Su- 
therland having, at his own private expense, laid out considerable 
sums on repairing the manse, " which was in no good case when 
he entered to the place," and which was valued altogether at 
L.481 Scots; and the Presbytery, « finding by a subscribed com- 
priseing of the said manse, at the said Mr Arthur Sutherland, his 
entrie thereto, the old manse was comprised to the .soume of nine- 
ty-seven pounds, Scots money," ordered the heritors of the parish 
to meet at Eddertoun, on the 6th April 1709, and " stent and 
tax themselves, according to their several valuations irithe fors 
paroch, for paying to the heirs and executors of the said Mr Arthur 
Sutherland the soume of L.384 Scots money ;" which was accord- 
ingly paid ; and shows that the heritors at that period considered 
themselves liable to the heirs of a clergyman for expenses neces- 
sarily incurred by him, though not laid out under the sanction of 
the presbytery. Besides his relict Mr Sutherland left a son, John, 
who was minister of Golspie 1731-52, and of Tain 1752-69, 
and of whom there is a sketch amongst the " Eminent Indivi- 
duals" of this parish. 

Mr Hector Fraser, — who seems to have been a probationer of 
the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and was sent north by the Assem- 
bly 1699, to supply vacancies in the bounds of Ross — that year 
he was ordained to Kincardine; and on the 12th September 
1706, an "act of transportability" as the privilege of accepting a 
call to another charge, if such a call should be given, was term- 
ed, having been passed by the united presbyteries of Ross and 
Sutherland in his favour, Mr Fraser accepted " a call from the 
paroch of Eddertown," which was presented to the presbytery 
30th November 1708. He died, after an eminently useful minis- 
try of twenty years, on the 17th of May 1729. 

Mr Robert Robertson succeeded : he was previously minister of

the parish of Loth in Sutherland, to which he had been ordained 
and admitted 10th May J 721. His settlement here was disputed 
for a considerable time ; but at last, as before noticed, Mr Robert- 
son received a Presbyterial call, on the 16th April 1730; and the 
presbytery of Dornoch, in which Loth is, having agreed on the 7th 
May to " transport him to the parish of Eddertoun," he was accord- 
ingly admitted here on the 29th July 1730. From the various steps 
taken previously to Mr Robertson's admission to Eddertoun, it 
will be readily seen, that, though the " act restoring patronage" 
had been passed nearly twenty years before, patrons of parishes 
were in the habit of allowing the people to choose their own mi- 
nisters, without any reference to them whatever, or presentation to 
a particular person being issued. Mr Robertson was minister of 
this parish only ten years, and died 13th December 1740. 

Mr Joseph Munro, son of Mr Robert Munro, minister of Kin- 
cardine, 1711-41, was licensed by the presbytery of Hadding- 
ton, 5th June 1739, and received a presentation to this parish 
from the Right Honourable the Earl of Cromertie, dated 2d June 

1741, which he accepted; but on the day appointed for moderat- 
ing in a call, the presbytery, finding that the heritors were unani- 
mously for Mr Munro, while all the elders and some of the heads 
of famihes there petitioned for another, Mr G. Robertson, then 
a probationer, and afterwards minister of Kincardine, they " re- 
ferred the case simpliciter to the synod." The call to Mr Munro 
was sustained by the synod of Ross, at their meeting in April 

1742, and the presbytery appointed to concur therewith; which 
was accordingly done, and Mr Munro ordained and admitted 
minister of Eddertoun on the 16th of September 1742. He died 
16th March 1785, in the seventy-first year of his age, and forty - 
third of his ministry. 

Mr Alexander Munro was ordained and admitted minister of this 
parish on the 28th September 1785. During the earlier part of 
his ministry here, he had to encounter considerable opposition, 
from his having been settled without the concurrence of the majo- 
rity of the parishioners. His high character, however, for piety, 
amiability, and diligence, secured to him the esteem of the pub- 

• This was the first instance of the patron exercising his right of presentation to 
this parish since the Revolution ; and even at tliis period the presbytery seem to 
have proceeded more on the call of the people than on the presentation. EversincL-, 
however, presentations have been issued by the family of Cromertie, " undoubted 
patrons of the parish of Kddertoun."

lie, and of those who were at first agauist him. Mr Munro died 
on the 30th October 1820, in the thirty-sixth year of his ministry. 

Mr Jlexander Cameron, A. M., Rector of lain Academy, 
was licensed by the Presbytery of Tain 12th August 1818, and 
ordained and admitted to Eddertoun, 13th September 1821. The 
patroness of the parish, Mrs Hay Mackenzie of Cromartie, in this 
instance, as in the general exercise of her patronage, consulted 
the interests and wishes of the people. Mr Cameron, according- 
ly, received a unanimous call, dated 21st July 1821, which con- 
tributed to his usefulness during an efficient ministry of fourteen 
years. He died at the early age of forty-two, 5th September 1835. 

Mr Donald Gordon, M. A., a licentiate of the presbytery of 
Tongue in Sutherland, was ordained assistant-minister of the 
parish of Edderachillis, 20th November 1822; admitted to the 
Parliamentary church of Store, in Assynt, 2d September 1829; 
and translated and admitted to Eddertoun, 7th April 1836;— and 
though then a stranger to the patroness, he was presented, the 
date of presentation being 5th December 1835, in compliance 
with the unanimous petition of the heads of families, communi- 
cants, ui the parish. Mr Gordon is the ninth minister of Edder- 
toun since the Reformation. 

There is no catechist regularly employed in this parish at pre- 
sent, but arrangements are being made for procuring one, who will 
reside permanently. 

There are two individuals belonging to the United Associate 
Synod, a remnant of the secession in Nigg, occasioned by a forced 
settlement there in 1756: they generally attend at a Dissenting 
meeting-house, which was recently erected in Tain. With the ex- 
ception of these, the whole of the parishioners are connected with 
the Established Church, and are very regular church-going people. 

The average number of communicants is 60, of whom 22 are 
male heads of famihes. 

The probable average amount of church collections yearly for 
religious and charitable purposes, is L. 30. 

Education.— There are three schools in the parish, a parochial, 
Gaelic, and female school, on the second patent of the Society for 
Propagating Christian Knowledge. 

The parochial school has been established for upwards of a cen- 
tury, and the salary has been the maximum since 1836. There 
are at present two schoolmasters,— Mr Finlay Matheson, appoint- 
ed in the year 1790, who was superannuated in 1836, with a por-

tion of the salary of L. 16 per annum; and Mr David Watson, 
elected in August 1836, who is the acting parochial teacher. 

There is one additional school required in the heights of the 
parish. 

Savings Bank. — There is one connected with this parish, which 
was established in Tain, January 1840. The minister of the parish 
is one of the directors. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid may be estimated at 60 ; and the ave- 
rage sum allotted to each is 7s. 6d. per week. The annual amount 
of contributions for their rehef is about L. '26 ; of which sum L. 7 
per annum is contributed by Sir Charles Ross of Balnagown, L. 3 
by the Duke of Sutherland, L. 2 by Mr Macleod of Cadboll, and 
the remaining sum of L. 14 which is the average for the last four 
years arises from church collections. 

There is generally a disposition among the poor to refrain from 
seeking parochial aid, as degrading; but the feeling is decreasing, 
from pecuniary distress and want of employment. 

Inn, Sfc. — There is no fair or market of any kind held in this pa- 
rish ; and there is only one small inn, or rather alehouse, which is 
situated on Struy road from Bonar Bridge to Stittenham. 

Puel. — The fuel used by the lower orders is peats, and turf, 
which can be easily procured in the moors, and costs only the 
trouble of cutting, seasoning, and carrying home. Coals are burnt 
by the higher classes, and are sold by the Newcastle vessels, which 
come to the bay of Ardmore, at 16s. 6d. per ton.

PRESBYTERY OF TAIN, SYNOD OF ROSS. 

THE REV. D. CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



T. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, -c.—The parish of Tarbat occupies the eastern 
promontory of the shire of Ross, being bounded on the south and 
east by the Murray Frith, and on the north by the Dornoch 
Frith, and terminating in a narrow point called Tarbat Ness, on 
which an elegant lighthouse has lately been built. 

From the want of woods and enclosures, the parish presents 
rather a naked appearance. 

Soil.~T\ie soil is generally light, a great deal of it being sandy ; 
but a considerable proportion of most of the large farms is a deep 
black loam, capable of bearing all ordinary farm produce; and 
the lighter lands in rainy seasons also give good crops of turnips 
and grass, from sea-ware, which the neighbouring shores supply 
in great abundance. 

A variety of caves occur along the shores of the parish— some 
occupied for many months together by bands of tinkers. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities.— There is, above the village of Portmaholmack, a 
green hill, called Chapel Hill, where there was discovered, on le 
veiling the ground for new buildings, a number of human bones 
deposited within rough flags of freestone. 

There is a beautiful piece of masonic work in the churchyard, 
called the Dingwalls' Tomb. 

On the north side of Tarbat Ness, at a creek called Port Chaistel, 
are the ruins of an old castle, overhanging the sea, and cut off 
from the land by a deep ditch ; and beside it, on the Black Moor, 
is the vestige of a Roman camp. Near the site of the lighthouse 
is the foundation of a monument, built, it is said, by the Romans 
as a land-mark.

The castle of Balone is a most ancient building, and perhaps 
the largest and the most entire now standing in Ross-shire. It is 
said to have been built by the Earls of Ross. But the last inha- 
bitants were the Earls of Cromarty, and Alexander Mackenzie of 
Ardloch Assint, brother to the late Earl George Mackenzie of 
Cromarty. It has not been inhabited by any respectable family 
for 200 years. 

Fragments of what is said to have been a Danish cross are to 
be seen scattered among the graves in the church-yard ; and a 
low green mound, adjoining the eastern gable of the church, is 
still pointed out as the site on which it stood. 

Several chests, composed of rough freestone flags, were dug up a 
few years ago, at a place in the neighbourhood of Portmaholmack, 
by labourers employed in levelling the ground for new buildings. 
Each chest contained an entire skeleton, of a size unusually large, 
and, from the position of the bones, it appeared that the bodies had 
been doubled. A number of small copper coins, all of Charles I., 
together with a lady's ring, encircled with the inscription, Finish my 
desire, rudely executed, were discovered about twenty years ago 
in a garden near Balone Castle. The ring is now in the pos- 
session of George Mackenzie Ross, Esq. of Aldie, and is said to 
be of considerable value. 

Parochial Registers.— The only parochial registers extant are, 
a book in which the minutes of the kirk-session are kept, and 
another in which births and marriages are recorded. The ear- 
liest entry in the first is in the year 1750, and in the second, 1801. 
These books have been regularly kept.

IV. — Industry. 
Plantations. — The plantations in this parish consist of the common 
Scots fir, elm, ash, beech, oak, hornbeam, sycamore, and hawthorn. 
The low grounds are boggy, and, though capable of being ren- 
dered congenial by draining, to the growth of alder, poplar, and 
willow, nothing has as yet been done in that way of improving 
them, excepting on the estates of Geanies and Rockfield ; in con- 
sequence of which, the eastern part of the parish has but a very 
bare and bleak appearance. 

The various sorts of timber of which the plantations consist 
are all planted, and of fifty or sixty years' standing. So dimi- 
nutive are the trees in point of size, in consequence of not having 
been properly attended to, that the average produce of thinning 
and felling for the last four years amounted only to L. 127 per 
annum. The average produce of gardens and orchards may be 
estimated at L. 20 per annum. 

The only kind of insect known here which is not common to 
any other part of the country, is a small insect, particularly 
hurtful to fruit trees. It is covered with a white downy kind 
of moss, and fastens in hordes round the stems, particularly of pear 
and apple trees, causing the leaves attached to the fruit stems, 
which they sometimes ascend to and fasten on, to fall off, and so 
discolouring the bark as to give it a very unhealthy appearance. 

Fisheries. — The herring-fishing commences about the middle 
of July, and continues till September. The fishing ground lies 
off Tarbat Ness, at the distance of about five miles, and is taken 
by certain landmarks. Curers engage their boats during the 
months of November and December, and give a bounty of from 
L. 5, 5s. to L. 8, 8s., varying according to the skill of the fisher- 
men, to each of the different crews at the time of enofaofement ; 
and each boat receives in May an advance of about L. 10, to as- 
sist in making the necessary preparations for sea. The number 
of boats engaged in fishing for the curers at the different stations 
in this parish, last season, was about 100; and the average take 
of each boat was 105 cranes, exclusive of many hundreds of 
barrels carried off, in carts, to various parts of the country. The 
total number of boats employed in fishing on the coast last season, 
is said to have been about 300. The haddock and cod-fishing 
continues from the close to the commencement of the herring- 
fishing season. The number of salmon taken annually is very in- 

confciderable. Lobsters and several other kinds of shell-fish are 

4

found in great numbers from May till August, and sold to vessels 
employed in collecting them for the London market. The fish 
ermen are, in general, industrious and frugal in then- habits. Many 
of them have good houses, and there are a few comparatively 
wealthy. The only vessel belonging to the place is the property 
of a fisherman. She is quite new, and cost L. 700, 

Remarks on the Agricultural state of the Parish since the year 
1798— At the commencement of this period, the parish ot lar- 
bat may be said to have been among the farthest back in the 
county, with respect to modern husbandry. There was neither 
grass, turnips, nor wheat sown in any part of the parish, except 
at the place of Geanies and a little at Bindal. All farming im- 
plements were of the rudest description. The only carts to be 
seen, except at the place above-mentioned, were what are called 
tumblers, or basket carts. The plough had almost no iron about 
if and the usual price for making one was two pecks of oats, the 
materials being always furnished by the farmer. It was generally 
drawn by from ten to fourteen oxen, cows, or horses, with the 
whole family in attendance ; and in the case of small croits, 
with the united cattle, ploughmen, and drivers of two or three 
families, whose deafening clamours may be faintly conceived 
by those who disturb the inhabitants of a well- stocked rookery. 
The corn-stacks were generally three in number; one for the 
laird, one for seed and sale, and one for family use : the barn 
was filled in the first place. In the case of the larger farms, a 
stack sometimes consisted of as much as sixty bolls of bear, with 
twenty of pease on the top, and was never thatched,— the pease 
being considered sufficient protection from all injury. 

There were no roads in the parish, nor any harbour on the 
coast at which grain could be shipped. The village of Portraa- 
holmack, in which there are at present 400 souls, consisted then 
of three houses and two storehouses for receiving rents, which 
were all paid in oatmeal and bear. 

The peasantry were a quiet, decent, industrious people, ready 
to learn, and of exemplary sobriety, honesty, and piety. Then- 
dress, which was very simple, was almost all home-made. In re- 
ference to which, it may be worth while mentioning, that, even at 
church, when, in their best robes, they had among them, except 
those who came from the place of Geanies, only six hats, and an 
equal number of printed gowns ; yet they always appeared clean 
and respectable.

ROSS AND CROMARTY. 



At a later stage in the period above-mentioned, a harbour was 
built at Portraaholmack, and a herring-fishery established there, 
which, though it is to be regretted that they may be justly charg- 
ed with having caused a declension in the morality of many of those 
who are occupied thereabout, are, in other respects, a very consi- 
derable advantage to the parish. The harbour, from its centrical 
position, affords great convenience to farmers shipping grain ; and 
the herring garbage, when mixed with earth, is found an excellent 
manure. 

In the year 1798, the farm of Mickle Tarrel in the parish was 
taken on a nineteen years' lease, by a farmer who had studied the 
most approved system of agriculture in East Lothian. The farm, 
which then consisted of about 250 acres of arable land, was occu- 
pied by several small tenants whose lands were in a state of wretch- 
edness, and their houses afforded accommodation for neither man 
nor beast. 

This farmer brought with him horses and implements of hus- 
bandry of the very best description from the south, as also farm- 
servants of his own training. This was the first introduction of 
modern husbandry to this part of the country, from which the in- 
troducer obtained the name of Farmer George. In bringing his 
system into practice, he had at first to contend with many deep- 
rooted prejudices. Even the proprietor could not then understand 
how his interests were to be promoted by encouraging his tenants. 
In the first place, a dwelling-house was to be built, as also a suit- 
able set of offices, houses, and a thrashing-mill, and a garden, &amp;c. 
enclosed. All this was done at the farmer's expense, without any 
assistance from the proprietor, and at an outlay of L.1500. 

The soil being good, and the new system bringing it into favour- 
able operation, the farmer soon began to reap the reward of his 
expense and labour, and in the seventh year after his entry, he had 
the satisfaction of obtaining for his wheat and oats the highest price 
m Mark Lane,— circumstances which dissipated the opposition of 
prejudice, and raised up a spirit of imitation. 

In the year 1802, Mr Archibald Dudgeon, a native of East Lo- 
thian, took the neighbouring farm of Arboll, which he still occu- 
pies. He likewise brought with him a choice assortment of farm- 
i"g implements from the same county, as also horses and farm- 
servants. The latter did not remain long, though with an excel- 
Jent master, and with whom some of his present servants have been 
for upwards of thirty years. Next, Mr Macleod, the ShcnlTor the

county, seeing the good effects of the new system, got a grieve 
fronti East Lothian, and commenced farming on the same princi- 
ple. About the same time, Mr Mackay purchased the lands of 
Little Tarrel, now Rockfield, and commenced extensive and judi- 
ciously conducted improvements in a very spirited manner. On 
the farm of Wester Geanies, the property of Aldie, a great deal 
was also done. 

The example was followed by several other farmers, and soon 
became general in the country, and the war prices giving encou- 
ragement to the exertions of agriculturists, the spirit of improve- 
ment went on with unabated vigour. 

At the close of the war, Captain Rose returned to the farm of 
Bindhill, in which he succeeded his father, and, converting his 
sword into a ploughshare, commenced farming on the new system 
with great spirit and success, which he has continued to the pre- 
sent date ; and has now the satisfaction of seeing the subject of his 
labours and improvements confirmed in the hands of his son-in- 
law, Mr Chisholm, by a new lease of nineteen years granted at 
this term ; who, it is confidently hoped, will uphold that benevolent 
and highly respectable character which the House of Bindal has 
hitherto maintained. 

The improvements which thus, in all quarters, made such rapid 
progress in regard to the soil, were kept pace with by those which 
respected the external' features of the farms. Taking a view of 
the parish' at the present period, we see the tenantry all live in 
comfortable well-furnished houses, with excellent accommodations 
for their corn and cattle ; and on all the larger farms, thrashing- 
mills, one impelled by wind, another by steam, and others by from 
four to six horses. In short, the parish of Tarbat is as well farmed 
as any part in the north, and the farmers are highly respectable, 
intelligent, and hospitable. 

The largest farms in the parish run from 150 to 350 acres, and 
the rents from L.l, 15s. to L.2 per acre. 

The system pursued here is the five and six course ; the four 
has been tried, and, on the farm of Mickle Tarrel, long practised 
with success. 

The country not being pastoral, the farmers here do not rear many 
cattle or sheep. They keep what is called a flying stock, which, 
after being well wintered on turnips, are sold at the early markets. 

Mr Archibald Dudgeon, at one time, had a stock of excellent 
Highland cows, which he selected from the purest breed in the 



466 



noSS AND CUOMARTV. 



country. He continued them for a good many years, always al- 
lowing them to suckle their calves, and that as long as they chose ; 
by which means, and every other attention to breeding, he raised 
such a stock as have returned him L.20 for three-year-olds. From 
their very high feeding, however, they lost some of those qualities 
which are esteemed in Highland cattle ; yet they still maintained 
their full beauty of symmetry. Mr Dudgeon may be said to be 
the only farmer in the parish who has always on hand a large stock 
of cattle, and these always well selected and high fed. He also 
feeds off a great number of wedders on turnips for the southern 
markets. 

Of late years, the store-farmershave been in the habit of send- 
ing down their hogs to the low-country, where they take turnips 
at from L. 4 to L. 5 per imperial acre, according to the quality. 
Sometimes, they are let at so much per head per week, generally 
seven farthings ; but the former arrangement is preferred by most 
farmers. In regard to the turnips, the ordinary practice \s, that 
one-third is drawn for the cattle in the farm-yard, and the remain- 
der eat off by the sheep. 

That the breeding of stock is comparatively but little followed 
up in this quarter, is owing to its being found less profitable, in 
consequence of the distance from market, &amp;c., not that the climate 
or soil is ungenial, nor the farmer deficient in the art, which has 
been sufficiently proved on the farms of ArboU and Mickle Tarrel. 
Of the former we have already spoken on this head, and of the 
latter we shall only mention that, at a sale there in the year 
1824, there were sold a horse for L. 84, a son of his rising "four 
years old for L. 52, 10s., and a saddle mare for L. 52, lOs.; a 
Highland fat cow for L. 25 ; a Highland bull for L. 50, and an- 
other for L. 40 ; and for an ox, six years old, that had been fed 
three years, L.75 were offered. And on one occasion, the former 
refused L.lOO for his riding pony. 

With regard to farm-servants, the system introduced at the , 
commencement of modern husbandry, and practised ever since, on 
almost all large farms, is what in East Lothian is called the hind 
system, and which, it may be observed, is, in most improved dis- 
tricts in Scotland, considered the best, both as regards the inte- 
rests of the farmer, and the morality and comfort of the servants. 

Mamifactures.— There are two branches of hemp manufacture 
carried on in the parish, viz. weaving and spinning. Weaving by 
6 men and 3 boys, and spinning by 300 women. This factory is

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE 

UNITED COUNTIES OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1586842">ROSS AND CROMARTY</name>.</head> 
<p>


The united counties of Ross and Comarty lie between 57°.8, 
and 58° 10 north latitude, and between 4° and 5°.46 weyt longitude. 
Exclusive of the Island of Lewis, their superficial extent is about 
2424 square miles. Including that island, they form the largest 
county in Scotland. They are bounded on the north by Suther- 
land and the Dornoch Frith ; on the south by Inverness-shire ; 
on the west by the Western Ocean ; and on the east by the Moray 
Frith. The breadth of the county from the extreme east at Tar- 
bat Ness, to the extreme west, is about 85 miles. 

The county of Cromarty is of small extent, consisting only of 
one parish, that of Cromarty, and, including all its scattered pen- 
dicles, containing about 220,800 imperial acres. Towards the 
end of the seventeenth century, several detached additions were 
made to this small county. This was done at the instance of the 
Earl of Cromarty, then Viscount Tarbat, who desired that one 
county might contain all his lands, wherever situate. These audi- 
tions consist of a district surrounding Tarbat House, on the north- 
ern shore of; the bay of Cromarty; of a district running from the 
south side of Dornoch Frith to the Moray Frith ; of two fragments 
of land on the north of the river Carron ; of a portion of land run- 
ning northward from the town of Dingwall, and including Castle 
Leod and part of Ben Wyvis ; of small portions of land to the 
north of Loch Fannich, and to the north of Loch Nid ; of a dis- 
trict stretching along the southern shore of Little Lochbroom ; of 
the large district of Coigeach between the northern shore of Loch- 
broom and Sutherland; also of the Summer Islands in Lochbroom. 
It is understood also that Royston or Caroline Park, about two 
miles from Edinburgh, forms a portion of the county of Cromarty. 

The county of Ross comprises the districts of Ardross, Easter 
Ross, Ardmeanach, or the Black Isle, Kintail, Strathcarron,

and the Island of Lewis. The western coast is indented by many 
lochs and bays of the most picturesque description, and often afford- 
ing excellent havens. 

The sheriffdoms of Ross and Cromarty were united by the 
Jurisdiction Act of 1748j 

The general aspect of the united counties is wild and moun- 
tainous, — but diversified by glens, rivers, and lochs. The western 
part of the county abounds in pasture of the best quah'ty : but the 
agricultural portion of the county is that which extends from Ding- 
wall along the Frith of Cromarty, onwards in a north-eastern di- 
rection along the Friths of Moray and Dornoch : there, agricul- 
ture, having the advantages of a fine climate and fine soil, is of the 
very best description, and is nowhere excelled in any part of Scot- 
land. 

The landed property of the united counties is valued in the 
cess-books at L. 75,043, 10s. 3d. Scots. In 1815, the annual 
value of real property was rated at L. 12 1,557. The Parliament- 
ary constituency in 1839 was 710.
