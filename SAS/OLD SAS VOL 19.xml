ftated parifh, was no parifll at ^ ^ ^ ^.^.^ 
b« that the other part, which was called the panffi of 
Skinnet, was a ftated parim of very early date before that 
period. Halkirk, by all I can, learn or conjefture, was 
originally no more than a chaplainry, occupied by the Bi- 
ihop's chaplain, who alfo ferved the great family, that had 
one of its feats at Brawell, a place very near the chapel, in 
that capacity. Here alfo the Bifliop had one of his feats, 
within a very few yards of the prefenf manfe. Irwas 
here, as I have it from report, that the Bifhop, whofe name 
I do not recoiled, was afTaffinated in a moftlhameful, cruel, 
and barbarous manner, by a fet of ruffians from Harpfdale 
a place belonging to the chaplainry. Thefe favages were 
called the fons of John of Harpfdale, whom the then Earl 
of Caithnefs fuborned, as inftruments very fit for the exe- 
cution of that alarming and horrid deed: The reafon why 
the Earl formed and executed this atrocious defign was, as 
it is reported, to be revenged of the Bifhop for afieffing' his 
lands in the chaplainry with an addition to the chaplain's 
living. This augmentation being very difagreeable to the- 
Earl, and of courfe to his tenants, roufed their refentment, 
and precipitated them into this fhocking deed. A molt ex- 
emplary and extraordinary punifliment was inffifted on the 
inftigators and perpetrators of this murder, at the inftance, 
and by the fpecial direction of King Alexander II. who, to 
his great credit and honour, exerted himfelf in a remark- 
able manner, in the difcovery, condemnation, and pu- 
Jiifhment of thefe prefumptuous culprits. What is record- 
ed in hiftory concerning this affair, feems to corroborate 
what I have from report ; and from the concurrent tefti- 
mony of both, there is reafon to believe, that this was the 
nobleft and moft diftinguilhing action of that King's life. 
But to return to the hiftory of the parifhes : — 

Origin 



of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011584">Halkirk</name>.

Origin of the Names.— The fpot where the chapel for- 
merly flood, and where now .the kirk of the two united 
.parifhes Hands, is a fmall round hill, in the middle of a 
large extenfive plain. From this fpot, as the centre, there 
is a very gentle rife, almoft in every direction, to the fur- 
rounding hills. From .this circumfiance, it is more than 
probable, the parifh derives its name ; for the rifmg ground 
whereon the kirk ftands is. called Tore H-arlogan, and the 
kirk, Teaumpul Harlogan, and fo retain the original Irifh 
names, though the parifh is called by the name of Hacrigg, 
and more frequently of Halkirk, which are manifeftly a 
■corruption of the original name, Tore, olaggan. Now, Lag' 
gan, in Earfe, fignifies a low place, the lowed in the neigh- 
bourhood, and Tore, a mount or fmall hill. Thus the ori- 
ginal name was compounded of Tore and Laggan ; and had 
it not been that the chapel was built on the fmall Tore, or 
hill, that is, in the middle of this low place or Laggan, this 
parifh would have been called parifh of Loggie, or Skit; a- 
laggan, or Laggy, as other parifhes in Scotland are called, 
for the fame reafon, as is evideut, from the'low fituation of 
the place of worfhip, when compared with the reft of the 
parifh •, whence it is very prefumable, that the original 
name of this parifh was, Skira, Thore, o Laggan, but in 
courfe of time was corrupted into the name Hacrigg, which 
has no meaning but analogy of found ; and becaufe the 
found Hacrigg refembles the Englifh word Halkirk, it was 
converted into that name. 

As to the name of the other parifh, it is fometimes pro- 
nounced Skinnet, fometimes Skinite, fometimes Skinilt, 
fometimes Skinnon, fometimes Ski?iinc. Nothing can be 
concluded from this confufed variety of pronunciation ; 
but from the fituation of the kirk, with the aid of thefe 
founds, I have reafon to believe that the real name fliould 
■be Skiea Noylte, the Wing of the Burn ; for that place goes 

off

Statijlical Account 



off from the burn that runs befide it, in the form of a' 
wing *. 

Situation and Extent.^Tht two united parifhes, or what 
is now called by the common name of Halkirk, is in length 
24 miles from N. to S. W. Its breadth is various, being 
m fome places 12, in other places 10, in fomje 8, in others 
"J miles, from the N. E. to the N. W. It is bounded on 
the N. by the pariflb of Thurfo ; on the N. E. by the pa- 
rifhes of Bower and Wattin ; on the S. and S. W. by the 
parifhes of Latheron, Kildonnan, Reay ; on the W. by a 
detached part of the parifh of Thurfo, and on the N. W. 
by the parifh of Reay again. It is fituated in the county 
and prefbytery of Caithnefs, and belongs to the provincial 
Synod of Caithnefs and Sutherland. It is an inland pari/h, 
and the moft centrical" in the county. 

Soil. — The foil is in general very good, though very va- 
rious. In fome parts it confifts of a mixture of clay and 
loam, in fome of a heavy or light kind of clay altogether, 
in many parts of a mixture of clay and a light kind of 

mofs, 

* The river that runs by the kirk is called Amhine Thorfe, i. e. River 
pf Thurfo; whence it may be fuppofable, that the river is called from a 
perfon or place, as rivers conjmonly are. The place or perfon might have 
been termed Thor, or Thorfa, a Danifli word ; now, Thor, or Thorfa, as 
it might have been pronounced in that language, is the name of a north- 
ern deity, from which was derived the name of a day, Thurfday, and of 
perfons, with fome variations and compofitions. Thus, for inftance, 
there were of old of the name OJdin, or O'Doiue, another northern deity, 
from which we have JVoddinf-lay, or Oddinfdny, or O'Doinefday ; and 
there are to this day perfons of a name patronimically derived from it, 
viz,. M:icodoit:e. or Oddin's Son. This may lead to a difcovery of the 
name of this parifh. The pi, ice where the kirk ftands is truly a laggan, 
cr low place, in the ftiidt fenle of the word ; and then, why might it not 
be compounded by the addition of Thor, or Thorfa, and fo called Thor 
G'Laggan, or Thorja 0' Lagg.w, i. c. The low place of Thor, or Thorfa ; 
as Thurfo is in Earfe called 1 Inner Thorfa, i. e. The Mouth of Thorfe. 
Thus Invernefs, UV. From Thor fevcral names are alfo derived, as Tcr 
quil, Mactlorquil, Thorkclin.

jpofc in feveral parts it is gravellHh or fandy, or 
chingily. It is ^ general not deep, rather mallow ; m 
; om e S p arts too mallow and rocky. The furface is rather 
flat • for though there are feveral hills or nfing grounds, 
yet they are of no confidence height, having a very gen- 
tie declivity in general from their fummits to the fubjacent 
plains, efpecially in the lower end of the parifti. 

Bif advantages arifing from the Soil, tf,.-To-the cir- 
cumftances above mentioned relative to the foil may be 
afcribed, in a great meafure, its wetnefs, which prevails 
very much, efpecially in winter, fpring, and latter end of 
harveft-, befides, the fogs, and mills, and rains, which are 
rather too frequent in this country, contribute much to 
this difagreeable quality ; another circumftance which tends 
to its wetnefs, is the kind of ftrata, which, in general, is not, 
in the arable ground, and other places, more than I foot, 
or it, or % feet at the utmoft, below the furface. Thefe 
ftrata in many places confift of a hard, heavy, petrified kind 
of clay, which may properly be called caput mortuum. In 
moft places, efpecially in the lower end of the parifh, they 
confift of flags, as they are here called, or large thin ftones, 
which lie in a horizontal pofition, and run clofe to one an- 
other, without any great interval or interruption. From 
thefe two laft circumftances it happens, that the furface is 
kept perpetually wet, except in the fummer and harveft, 
for neither of thefe ftrata will fuffer the water to fink or 
filtrate through them, therefore it muft remain on the fur- 
face, till it is either exhaled by fun and wind, or runs 
off along thefe ftrata to the adjacent fwamps, lakes, and 
burns, which, by the bye, muft be very flow, the declivity 
to thefe being in many places very inconfiderable. This, 
moreover, occafions, in a great meafure, the great damp- 
nefs or chillinefs of the ground, which are fo inimical to 
vegetation, and peculiarly noxious to the roots of trees,

length of the day, and of the earth being laid on thefe hard 
and unpenetrable llrata, as above obferved, to very near 
the furface; in thefe months, and for thefe reafons I 
fav, our crops make a very rapid progrefs ; nay, I will 
venture to fay, a much greater, than in any part of Great 
Britain or even in more fouthern kingdoms, in that fhort 
period of time. From this circumftance it happens, that 
xve have as good a crop generally, and as early a har veft, 
and oftentimes earlier, than they have in more foutheru 
countnes. But I muft fay, that all our profpecl of a crop 
depends m a very great meafure on the complexion and 
temperature of thefe months. If they are favourable, we 
are fure of a great and good crop ; if not, we,have no great 
reafon to expe£t a fuitable return. 

Another advantage, worthy to be obferved, is, that thefe 
flags, or flat flones, are moll excellently calculated for 
building, and that with £ reat cafe and expedition, and

Mttle expence. They are at hand in many places,, eafily 
worked in the quarry, joined to one another in ftraight 
feams, which makes them eafily. feparable afunder, very 
plain and fmooth on the furface, ftraight and plain on the 
fides, of a hard and elaftic quality, and of a very beau- 
tiful blue colour. They are • generally in the form of a 
fquare or parallelogram, of different areas and thicknefs. 
I have feen fome of them, about 14 feet fquare, and only 
about if inches thick. They anfwer feveral purpofes, fuch. 
as flooring of rooms, whether low or high r roofing of hou- 
fes, partitions,, large cheftsfor meal, bottle- racks ; very few 
of them will ferve moft of the purpofes above mentioned^ 
I have feen houfes made of them altogether, and very few 
of them required to complete the houfe- When properly 
manufactured, they are not much inferior to Eafdale flate, 
as they can be got in feveral places of a proper thinnefs for 
that purpofe ; now, thefe muft be great advantages to a 
country where there is no timber, but what is brought to it 
with much trouble and vaft expence, which makes that ne- 
ceffary article much dearer here, and lefs ufed than almoft 
in any other country. 

Arable Ground, Pajlures, Meadows, li?c, — Befides the 
arable ground, which is very confiderable and extenfive in 
feveral parts, there is a great deal of wafte ground very 
capable of cultivation and improvement to a very great 
degree. What has been done this way during my incum- 
bency, though very fliort of what it might have been, had 
the proprietors confulted their own intereft, and prized 
their advantages, is a plain demonftration what a valuable 
addition might be made to their fields, their purfes, and 
their people ; and a mighty motive and encouragement to 
prompt them to beftow a particular attention on fo good 
and ufeful an object. Failure ground and meadows" are 
alio in great abundance, very fertile and beautiful, produ- 
cing 



^ Statiflical Account 

cing annually large crops of grafs, very fit for hay or pa- 
"urage. Thefe, becaufe of their low fituation, are drenched 
with water moftly all the winter and fpring, which cir- 
cumrtance contributes much to the luxuriancy of their 
crop. Moll of our hills or riling grounds, and alfo of our 
moors, are well adapted for what we call ordinary or High- 
land pafturage, and capable of maintaining a very great 
number of cattle. Thefe circumftances, together with the 
want of inclofures and winter herding, are in a great 
meafure the caufes why the people do not trouble them- 
lelves with railing any crops of clover and rye-grafs. 
Of late years, indeed, feveral attempts have been 
made this way, which have been very fuccefsful ; and 
it is to be hoped, that this ufeful praftice will foon 
become more general. The reft of the parifh confifts 
of fwamps, marines, bogs, or deep mofc, all of great 
extent, but very fit for Highland pafturage for the 
greateft part of the year. When to thefe are added the 
great number of lakes or lochs, fmall and great, which are 
almoft in every quarter of the parifli, there is reafon to be- 
lieve that the fiftieth part of it is not in culture. Yet, after 
all, it will be allowed, that it has the greateft variety, the 
greateft advantages, as well as the moft pleafant and enter- 
taining profpeds, of any parilh in the county. 

Climate^Mutual bifluence of Soil and Climate on one 
another,— Lifadvantage from that Influence—Though the 
climate is not in general very agreeable, yet I am perfua 
ded it is much better than it is repreiented and imagined 
to be by people of other countries. For they who come 
only for a ftart into the country, have no great opportunity 
of knowing it; and they who never were in it, are, from 
the report of thofe who were, prejudiced againft it. R e - 
lides, from its more northern fituation, they are apt to con- 
clude that the difference between this climate and theirs is 



more 



of Halkirk. 0 

more than it aftually is. But I will not hefitate to affirm; 
that, had our climate been equally good with our foil, thd 
Inhabitants of more fouthern counties would covet our 
more northern fituation. However, it muft be acknow- 
ledged, that neither our climate or foil are fo agreeable a* 
could be wimed, and that the refpeaive nature of each, con- 
tributes mutually to this difagreeable circum fiance. They 
have a mutual influence on one another, as may appear 
hereafter in the courfe of thefe obfervations. 

But this difagreeablenefs proceeds not fo much from 
our northern fituation, as from other caufes fuch as the 
fwampnefs and flatnefs of the country; its abounding 
fo much in fens, mvirfhes, lakes, Uc; its being expofed, 
without any interruption, to the baleful influences of the 
N. N. W. and N. E. ; and finally, to the hills and moun- 
tains on the S. and S. W. which inviron it in thefe quar- 
ters, and intercept, in fome degree, the genial and benign 
influences of the S. and S. W. From thefe high hills or 
mountains, which are, as it were, the barriers between this 
country and Sutherland, there is a declivity all along to 
the N. N. W. and N. E. fhores. Thig contributes confi- 
derably to the coldnefs, the inconftancy, and variablenefs 
of our climate, being thereby devoted to all the evils that 
come upon us from thefe quarters^ over an immenfe fracT! 
and body of water to the north pole. But this circum- 
ftance is not more hurtful and difadvantageous to us,- than 
it is beneficial and advantageous to the neighbouring 
county. For thefe mountains fhelter and defend them frorri 
many of thefe evils to which we are expofed ; and I am 
truly of opinion, that had thefe mountains been fituated in 
a contrary direction to us, an-d the declivity of the country 
in a contrary direction alfo, we would have a more agree- 
able climate and foil than we have, though, by the bye, all 
things confidered, we have no great caufe to complain.

confined my thoughts to this parifh in particular; but this" 
make no difference, for almoft every particular that is ap- 
plicable to tins parifc, is in a degree lefs or more applicable 
alfo to the whole country, at large. But to proceed : . 

*rom the mutual influence of the foil and climate on. 
one another, arife the frofts, the noxious winds, the ftorms 
with which we are vifited frequently in April, May,. and 
fometimes in June ; for when the air has a currency from 
the N. N.E. and N.W. it fcours along the country, 
armed and impregnated with all the noxious and nipping 
qualities it gathers or contraas in its progrefs over the 
north feas ; and thefe qualities are again feconded and im- 
proved by what, in its progrefs- over the land, it receives 
from the wetnefs-and dampnefs of the foil, and from- the 
marines, fens, lakes, and deep mofs, with which it abounds ; , 
to this alfo is to be afcribed the frofty and blafting influen. 
ces of the air, fometimes in Auguff and often in Septem- 
ber. Hence the vapours, miffs, and mildews, which are 
fometimes very hurtful in that feafon of the year, to the 
great difappointment of the farmer. Thefe are no lefs ini- 
mical to the crops of trees and tender vegetables ; to the 
bud, the foliage, and the tender part of the branches, that ■ 
was the growth of the immediately preceding year and 
feafon, than the dampnefs and lhallownefs of the foil is to 
the root. But yet I muff fay, that feveral fruit-trees, and 
other kinds of timber, would grow and thrive here pretty 
well, if their crops could be defended and Iheltered from 
thefe influences of the N. N. E. and N. V/. I am warranted 
in this aflertion by obfervations I have made on a fir plant- 
ing in my neighbourhood, belonging to Sir John Sinclair, 
and planted by his father. About 18 years ago the young, 
trees made no unpromiling appearance ; on the contrary, 
I they

,hey continued in ablooming, lively, and thriving ftate until 
by degrees they overtopped the dikes and fences whereby 
they are inclofed. From that date they withered and de- 
caved gradually in their crops-, the baleful infe&amp;on, which 
made an eafy prey of the tender crops of the branches, 
communicating itfelf therefrom downwards to the ftronger 
parts, and from thence to the furface of the ground. The 
whole planting is now decayed to the very root, which full 
retains fome life and vigour, and the branches flioot out 
from it almoft flat on the furface of the ground to fome 
diftance, and wear a green and vivid appearance. From this 
circumftance it is evident, .that though the foil is not the 
inoft favourable to planting, yet if the influences of the 
north could be prevented from the crop, timber of fome 
kinds would thrive here pretty well ; yet I by no means 
think, that the fir is any wife calculated for growing in this 
country. 

To thefe caufes muft alfo be attributed the difficulty of 
making roads in this parifh, and indeed in the country in 
general. By Sir John Sinclair's example, and the encou- 
ragement given by him, the whole country was animated, 
and heartily engaged, in making, repairing, and improving 
roads, which proved to be a great advantage •, but yet, from 
the caufes above mentioned, there is reafon to apprehend, 
that what is already done in this way will foon ferve no 
other purpofe but only a direction to ftrangers, if more labour 
and expence, with more attention, be not beftowed upon it ; 
and we may be thankful, if even after that the roads will 
be tolerable for more than one half of the year. However, 
the country has great credit from the exertions they have 
already made, and flill continues to make, in oppofition to 
thefe difficulties ; and it is to be regretted, that their fuccefs 
-has hitherto been far, very far fhort of their laudable exer- 
tions. At the fame time, it is to be hoped, that by the plan

pow adopted, if executed with perfeverance, every diffi- 
culty wll be Amounted, and the country accommodated 
to their wifh in fufficicnt and durable roads. 

Salubrity of the Climate, Health of the People, Longevity, 
tSWrom the above obfervations on the foil and climate, 
a perfon would be apt to conclude, that they muft be ini- 
mical to health, and very prolific of a variety of diftempers 
which detrad from the comforts of life, and confine it to a 
very contracted period ; more efpeciahy when the extra- 
ordinary inconftancy of the climate is confidered, which 
often goes to extremes in the fpace of 24 hours ; for it is 
not unufual to be vifited here with all the coldnefs and ri- 
gours of winter, and the fervour and heat of a fummer-day, 
in the fpace of 12 hours. But I can fay from experience' 
and observation, as well as from the teftimony of the oldeft 
perfons here, that there is not a more healthy country in 
Britain, efpecially to thofe who are its natives, or are natu- 
ralifed to it. There is no difeafe that can be called pecu- 
liar to it ; neither are the diftempers by which we are vi- 
fited more frequent, or more fatal and violent, than in other 
countries, that are efteemed very healthy and falubrious. 
Hence the natives are in general very healthy, vigorous, 
firm, agile, well proportioned, excellently calculated to un- 
dergo fatjgue and hardfhips; nay, I believe that in thefe 
qualities they excel, and that this, with their active and 
enterprifing fpirit, is the reafon why this country is the 
firft, the readieft, and beft nurfery for the Britifti army. 
There are befides inftances of longevity not a few. In the 
courfe of my incumbency, there have been feveral men 
and women who furvived 100 years and upwards, many 
who exceeded 80, and at prefent there are a fcore who are 
either 90, or ou the confines of that period, and moll of 
h^m perfectly found both in body and mind. Here I

ihduld not omit obferving, that there is a man in my near 
neighbourhood, on the borders of 80 years, who can num- 
ber upwards of 120 perfons of his own progeny, befides 
thofe who have died. The number is flill increafing by 
his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, tff. ; and 
what is worthy of particular remark, he is ftill healthy and 
vigorous, and is as able to add to the number by his own 
perfonal exertions, as he was feveral years ago ; fo that if 
he be fpared but for a few years, I have no doubt but he 
may fee the number doubled. 

Mineral Springs, — Lifcovery of Lime and Marl. — From 
the circumftances above mentioned, relative to the foil and 
climate, it will naturally be concluded that there are a 
great many fprings' in the parifh •, fo there are, in very 
great abundance, and of moft excellent quality in general. 
That fome of thefe fprings are mineral I have no doubt ; 
but of what kind of mineral, and for what particular kind 
of diftempers they may be falutary, I am not naturalift 
enough to enable me to determine. There is only one in 
the parifh that attracted the attention of the people, and to 
which they afcribe falutary efFecls ; it is called the Well of 
Halkirk, fituated in the near neighbourhood of the church ; 
and its water has been ufed for a cure by fick perfons in- 
difcriminately, but not near fo much fo as formerly. "What 
benefit they have derived, or do derive from it, neither 
they nor I can tell, unlefs it nattered and gratified their 
imagination at the time. It is very limpid and clear, of a 
moft pleafant relifh, arid rifes in great abundance with a 
perpendicular force from bottom to top. On its furface 
lies always a thin, beautiful kind of fubftance, that varies 
like the plumage of the peacock, difplayed in all its glory 
to the rays of the fun. What brought this fpring to a parti- 
cular notice beyond other fprings in the parifh, which, for 

aught 



*4 Statijlical Account 

aught I know, may be equally medicinal and falubri- 
ous, was the following circumftance : One of my prede- 
ceflbrs in office, who happened to have fome knowledge of 
.fhyfic, reforted tp it perpetually while he lived, and was 
able to walk to it, and drank of it moft copioufly. In the 
courfe of his reiterated vifits he difcovered a rich kind of 
marl and limeftone round the well. Whether the water 
contributed to his health I know not, but I am fure it con- 
tributed to his pleamre, and that the lime and marl availed 
much to the fertility of his glebe and fmall farm. To this 
iimple incident is to be afcribed the firft ufe of mineral 
water, and the firft ufe and difcovery of lime and marl in 
this part of the country. 

j L a ^s.—Ks the parilh abounds in fprings, fo in propor- 
tion it abounds in lakes. There are no lefs than 24 great 
and fmall. The moft confiderable are the lochs of Cathel, 
of Leurary, Loch more, Lochmeady ; but the largeft is that 
of Cathel ; it is 3 miles long, 2 broad, if not more, very 
deep, and almoft perpetually full to its fartheft banks. 
They all abound with excellent trout, and eel of different 
kinds and fizes ; thefe fifties differ alfo in colour, according 
to the nature of the lake where they were fpawned. In the 
lake of Cathel there aretrouts, which are found no where 
elfe in the country, of a reddifh beautiful colour, a pretty 
ihape, very fat, and moft pleafant eating. I fufpeft they 
are that kind of fifh which naturalifts call frem-water her- 
ring. There are no pike-fifh in any of them, which is an 
advantage, for reafons well known. 

Rivers, their Fijh, and Bridges. — There are feveral wa- 
ters in the parim, which are perpetually fupplied from 
thefe lakes, and fome other lakes in the neighbouring pa- 
rifhej!. In time of fpeat or flood, all thefe waters are both 

dreadful 



of Halkirk. *5 

dreadful and dangerous, and often overflow and inundate 
the vallies and plains through which they run, e fpecially 
k the heights of the parifli, where they are attended with 
fonve damage, yet none of them merits the name of a river, 
but one, which is called the river of ftrti 
originates principally at Lochmore, a very beautiful lake 
in the height of the parilh. In its courfe it receives all 
the other waters and ftreams, which it difcharges at Thur- 
fo into the Pentland frith. They all abound with excellent 
trout and eel • but the river of Thurfo is very diftinguifti- 
able for falmon, many in number,, and excellent in quality. 
It is allowed, that better and more agreeable falmon is not 
to be found any where ; I believe it is alfo the earlieft in 
Britain for furniming that fifh ; nay, it wants not clean 
and frefli falmon every day in the year ; yet the fifhing of 
it is of late years Very much on the decline ; to what caufe 
this is to be attributed, it is not difficult to conjefturc I£ 
this is not feafonably adverted to and obviated, it is to be 
feared that a very fine and ufeful falmon-nlhing may, in a 
few years, be reduced to nothing. From this river the 
town of Thurfo derives its name ;. for the name of the ri- 
ver is Thorfa in Earfe, and of the town Inver of Thorfa. 
Why the river is called Thorfa I cannot tell, unlefs it was 
fo called from Thor, a Scandanavian deity. It runs almoft 
all 'along in a ftoney or fandy channel, is very rapid and 
impetuous in time of fpeat, and in certain feafons of the 
year, proves a great terror to all who inhabit near its banks \. 
for it fometimes happens that it fWeeps away corn and hay 
in harveft from all the plains and vallies through which it 
paffes into the fea, and fometimes the tilled ground, to the 
great lofs and difappointment of the farmer, and detriment of 
the land ; yet few rivers are more beautiful, or run through 
a more pleafant tracT: of country. There is a great variety 
of profpetts along its banks, which are bordered with rich 

meadows. 



16 



Statijiical Account 



meadows, fertile fields, almoft to its fource, Lochmore, 
where the falmon delight to dwell in great abundance, and 
to which they all run, if not prevented in their courfe. 
I here are no bridges worth noticing on any of thefe 
waters, (only one on the laft mentioned), which is the 
occafion of great inconveniency to the inhabitants of this 
parifh in particular, and to the country in general, and no 
lefe fo to Grangers and travellers from other countries. This 
badge is of pretty long ftanding, extremely well built, 
. very ftrong and fufficient } there is none in the north of 
Scotland can excel it in ftrudure and ftrength ; for if it had 
not been wonderfully ftrong, and well adapted to the na- 
ture of the river, and other circumftances too tedious to 
mention, it would have been deftroyed and fweeped away 
many years ago ; it has got very fevere trials during my 
incumbency, which very few bridges could withftand, and 
yet continues as firm and unimpaired as at the beginning, 
and is likely to ftand for ages, if any the leaft attention is 
paid to it, which it well deferves. It is of mighty advan- 
tage to the country ; but yet, before many inconveniencies 
and dangers arifing from the river can be obviated, more 
bridges than one would be neceffary. It was projected by 
Sir George Sinclair of Clyth, one of Sir John Sinclair's 
predeceflors, for the accommodation of his tenants in the 
neighbourhood, (who are numerous), and of the country at 
large, and he left and configned a fum for the execution of 
it. It was accordingly undertaken and executed by John 
Sinclair of Ulbfter, Efq; Sir John Sinclair's grandfather, 
who, to the original fum deftined for that purpofe, added 
liberally out of his own funds. It ftands in the near neigh- 
bourhood of the church, at the diftance of 6 miles from the 
town of Thurfo, and confifts of 3 arches. Before I clofe 
this article, I mould mention another water, which runs only 
through a fmall part of this pari/h, at the extremities of it, 

and 



of Halkirk. 17 

and is next in bignefc to the laft mentioned, I mean the 
water or river of Forfs. It is a very rapid and dangerous 
water, efpecially in time of fpeat, abounds with excellent 
trout, and a confiderable number of falmon are fiflied in it 
every year ; a few years ago there was a very good bridge 
built upon it, at a place in the parifh .of Reay, and very 
few waters in the country need it more. 

Hills and Mountains.— -Having in fome meafure antici- 
pated the article of hills or mountains, in my observations 
on the foil and climate, very little may be faid of them 
here. The only hill that is anywife worthy of notice, is 
that of Spittal. The fummit of it is 4 miles from the 
neareft bank of the river Thurfo, from whence there is 
a very gentle elevation to its bafe. From this to the fum- 
mit the acclivity is very confiderable. It is green all over, 
not very high, though yet I believe it is the higheft in this 
end of the country. It has the command of a very plea- 
fant, grand, and extenfive profpeft, being the moft centri- 
cal in the country. Immediately on a perfon's arrival at 
the top, the Orkney Ifles, the Pentland frith, the ftupendu- 
ous rocks on each fide of the frith, and the furrounding feas, 
burft on his view at once, and overwhelm him with fur- 
prife and tranfport ; nor is he lefs delighted when he be- 
holds the whole country expofed in all its varieties, as it were, 
in a map, to his eye, looking down from this elevated 
centre' on the grand fubjacent and circumjacent objects. It 
is I believe 7 miles diftant from the north fhore, 12 miles 
from the eaft fliore, and 14 from the north -weft more, ha- 
ving a gradual, gentle afcent from thefe Ihores, with the 
interruption of fome fmall hills or riling grounds. Its pre- 
cife height I cannot determine, having neither the opportu- 
nity nor the inftruments proper for taking it. The name

Statiflical Account 

of it is derived from the religious houfe, which was imme- 
diately below it, called the Hofpital, by way of contrac- 
tion, Spittal. 

Another hill fhould not here be omitted; becaufe, 
though it is not in this parifc, it is yet on the near confines 
of it, I mean the hill of Dorrary. Its diftance from the 
bpittal Hill is about 12 or 13 miles due weft. It is of con- 
siderable height, if taken from the more or the church, of this 
parifh. There is a good deal of arable ground about its 
bafe, which yields good crops of corn, a prodigious quantity 
of natural hay, and affords excellent pafture for a great 
number of cattle 5 it is, therefore, efteemed the beft High- 
land farm in the country. It belongs to the parifh of 
Thurfo, though not Within 4 miles' of any part of that pa- 
riflu It is a part of the bi/hop-lands, was a fhieling be- 
longing to the bifhops of this county, and from this cir- 
cumftance it derives its name. It commands the fame 
grand extenfive profpeft with the other hill, though it is 
not fo centrical. 



Marl, Stones, Limejlone, Mines.— There have been dif- 
covered of late figured ftones, having the impreflion of 
plants and fifties. Thefe were found in the courfe of at- 
tempts that were made by the direction and encourage- 
ment of Sir John Sinclair, to difcover mines. I have been 
alfo informed, that ftiells of feveral kinds have been, and 
are ftill to be found in feveral parts of this parifh ; and this 
is not to be doubted, fince great quantities of marl, excel- 
lent in its kind, are found in feveral parts, and applied to 
land with great fuccefs and advantage. 

As to ftones, having anticipated this article, I will only 
further obferve, that there is no freeftone in this parifh ; 
that there are excellent lime-quarries, attended with this 
great advantage, viz. excellent peat-banks clofe by them ; 

and 



of Halkirk. 



19 



and that the lime they produce far excels any we get from 

any other country. 

As to mines, the furface of the ground, the colour of the 
fubftance which covers feveral fprings, the colour with 
which the ftreams of thefe fprings tinge their channels and 
banks, the effays and attempts that have been made for 
difcovery of mines, furnifh every fymptom and appearance 
that mines are not wanting in this parim. But I much 
fufpea, that more labour, expence, and perfeverance is ne- 
ceffary to prove fuccefsful. What kind of mines thefe ap- 
pearances indicate, I will not pretend to determine. But 
this I can fay, that feveral years ago 1 faw the beginning 
of a vein, but very trifling, and faw alfo pure lead extraded 
from the ore. Further, I obferved in this parim, and fe- 
veral parts of the country, a very heavy hard kind of 
brown ftone, in great abundance, on the furface of the earth, 
which I am apt to conclude may be iron ore, but whether 
good or bad of its kind I cannot fay. This depends on 
trial. 

Thunder, TempeJIs, Water-fpouts. — This parim is fome- 
times vifited with thunder, lightning, tempefts, hurricanes, 
water-fpouts, terrible in their appearance, but in general 
attended with no confiderable mifchief. Till about 5 years 
ago, thunder for feveral years was very rare, more efpe- 
cially during the late bad and unfavourable years j fomuch 
fo, that the country rejoiced when they heard on a morn- 
ing repeated claps of thunder in thefe hard times *, flat- 
tering themfelves with the hopes that they were to ufher in. 
a change to the better in the feafons, as they had not heard 
them for a long time before. But they were difappointed 
in their expectations, for the weather immediately after- 
wards became more cold and ftormy. They are consider- 
ably more frequent and loud of late years. Earthquakes, 

which 



20 Statijlical Account 

which commonly happen with fuch ftorms and tempefts 
as we have fometimes here, were never felt or known in 
this parifh or country, fo far as T can learn. Three remark- 
able water-fpouts happened in the courfe of the laft 50 
years, The laft one happened about 13 years ago. It ap- 
pears from the aftonifhing effeds they produced on and 
near the places where they fell, that had they happened in 
any of the inhabited parts of the parifh, the conferences 
would have been lamentable and fatal indeed. They fell 
on the high and remote parts of the parifh, which will bear 
teftimony to thefe events for many ages to come. But, 
after all, I am inclined to fufpeft, though thefe effects are 
afcribed to water-fpouts, that they were produced from an- 
other caufe, v«s. from the irruption of an immenfe collec- 
tion of water, penned up in fome of the prodigioufly deep 
and very extenfive morafies, which are not few in the 
Highland parts of the parifh ; and what gives this the fem- 
blance of probability is, that in many of thefe moraffes, or 
Jiows, as they are here called, when the furface is bored, the 
water iflues out like a torrent with great force. 

Here I mould. not omit a real water-fpout, in the ftrift. 
fenfe of the word, that happened about 200 years ago on 
the loch of Cathel ; a whole family rending on a. very fniall 
ifland in the loch, excepting the youngeft child and his 
nurfe, were deftroyed by it. This awful event was fo far 
from being a caufe of regret to the neighbourhood, that 
they exceedingly rejoiced at it, as thereby they were hap- 
pily delivered from the terror and rapine with which they 
were perpetually annoyed and harafled by that lawlefs and 
plundering family ; for they lived on rapine and - plunder, 
and fortified themfelves on this fmall ifland, to the utter 
defiance and vexation of the opprefled neighbourhood. 
The matter of this family was by name Gaine Kiaricach, 



of Halkirk.

of a certain branch of the Henderfons in this country. 

Quadrupeds. Birds indigenous and migratory. Game.— 
The quadrupeds in this parifh, both domeftic and wild, 
harmlefs and ravenous, are much the fame as in other High- 
land parifties, and notlefs numerous. For the game, there 
are fome deer and roe, alfo otters, foxes, and hares, m 
great abundance. About 60 years ago, no hares were to 
be feen in this parifh. or country ; now they are not plentier 
any where than here. 

The birds that are native or indigenous are the fame 
alfo as in other northern Highland parifhes, and not lefs 
numerous. The migratory birds are the fame alfo ; fuch 
as the feltifer, the green plover or lapwing, the quail or 
corn-crake, the woodcock, the cuckoo, the fnow-fowl. For- 
merly the lapwing vifited this parifh, in multitudes ; now 
we do not fee the hundredth part of what was wont to be 
feen of them ; and very foon, as the number yearly de- 
creafes, we will fee none at all. The fpring feafts in Eng- 
land will foon deftray that delicious bird we were wont to 
rear and feed for their table, and deprive us of their vifita. 
The birds for game are of various kinds, and fome kinds 
very numerous, the moorfowl, the blackcock, the tarma- 
chan, plovers of feveral kinds, fnipes, pigeons, partridges. 
It is only of late years that this laft bird was to be feen 
here. We have alfo fwans, wild-geefe of different kinds in 
vaft numbers, ducks in great variety and numbers alfo, be- 
fides feveral other birds too tedious to mention. On the 
whole I know not any place that can afford better game 
than this parifh. 

Population, its Increafe, Caufes ajjignedfor it, ifc. — The 
number of inhabitants has rather increafed during my in- 
cumbency*

Matijlical Account 
cumbency, which is upwards nf 

reafon to believe from TeT 3 ^ ^ ; ^ 1 haVC 
cueve » »om the concurring report of all the verv 

old people with whom I have been tailing on the f IZI 
ber is at leaf* one fourth more than it was about 7 o years 

Agriculture has made confiderable progrefs during that 
period and m proportion to its progrefs, a greater number 
of hands were needed to carry it on. Induftrv and fruga- 
lity kept pace with this progrefs , as the inhabitants were 
gradual enlightened, fo they were gradually awakened, 
and incited to aftion ; their neceffities and wants grew 
greater as they multiplied; this put their invention to the 
trial, and their wants and invention introduced feveral em- 
ployments, and feveral Ihifts for living, to which they were 
grangers before, and for which they did not care ; for truly 
I believe that they knew no want, and felt no necemty for 
diligence and activity before that period. Thefe circum- 
ftances furnilhed employment, and employment made room 
for hands ; and numbers of hands that could live in idle- 
nefs before, but could not do fo now, were ready to embrace 
and avail themfelves of it. Hence a variety of implements 
and utenfils for hufbandry, y c . which were very few and 
fimple before, were afterwards found necefTary; and of 
courfe and by confequence, artifts and tradefmen, who were 
alfo very fcarce before that period, to make them. Hence 
a fmall farm, that was wont to be worked by very few 
hands, cannot now be wrought to any purpofe, without 
fome additional hands ; for the rent being formerly very 
low, and other neceflaries eafy to be got, very little 
pains was neceflary to live and keep credit by that farm. 
But now the cafe being altered, there is a neceflity for rai- 
ling better crops, and for more labour and induftry, before 
the family can be fnpported, credit kept, and all neceflary 

demands 



of Halkirk. 



demands anfwered. Hence, feveral fpots that have been 
neglected and defpifed before, as there wasnoufe for them, 
are now fufficient to employ feveral hands, and to main- 
tain feveral families. Hence, finally, people are called 
forth much earlier into life, and employed in bufinefs, who 
before that period would be only as playful children at the 
firefide, and quite ufelefe to themfelves and others. 

Thus the number of perfons being increafed, and bufi- 
nefs and wants having enlarged their narrow fphere, and 
taken a wider compafs, trafHck and commerce, arts and 
manufactures ftarted into being. They now begin to creep 
and crawl and I hope they will foon be able to throw 
away their leading-fixings, and to make more ftately mo- 
tions, and more mafculine exertions. 

Another cirenmftance, that contributed confiderably to 
the increafe of population, mould not here be omitted. Be- 
fore the period above mentioned, people in general did 
not enter fo early into the conjugal ftate. The Jlorgea, or 
impetus of nature, was fuperfeded by motives of intereft 
and conveniency. But now, vice verfa. thefe prudential 
confederations are facrificed to the impulfe of nature, which 
is allowed its full fcope ; and very young people ftretch 
and extend their necks for the matrimonial noofe, before 
they look about them, or make any provifion for that ftate. 
Often times, indeed, motives of intereft, and the impulfe 
of nature, combine with united force, and precipitate them 
into that ftate at a very early period of life. Whether this 
practice is favourable to the improvement of the fpecies, I 
much fufpecr. ; but that it is very much fo to population I 
have every reafon to believe. 

It is true, indeed, that population has of late years re- 
ceived no fmall check from the junaion of farms, from 
emigration, and from the vaft numbers that have gone to 
the army during this and the former war. But yet it is oa 
3 the 



24

the increafe, though not fo much fo as it would have been 
without thefe checks. 

Having thus endeavoured to account for the increafe of 
population in the period above mentioned, I now proceed 
to lay down the prefent ftate of it. 

State of Population, how divided, WV— According to the 
belt inquiry and emulation I could make, the prefent ftate 
of population is as follows, (from which it will appear, that

*75 5 , his ftate being then 3075 fouls, is I05 ) families 
530 ; fouls 3180 ; of thefe fouls 1650 are males, 1530 fe- 
males. Below five years of age, 443 j between five and 
ten years, 509 ; between ten and twenty years, 685 ; be- 
tween twenty and fifty, 986 ; between fifty and feventy, 
482; between feventy and eighty, 55; between eighty 
and ninety years, 20. Of this number, there are 380 ba- 
chelors ; maidens, 400; widowers, 40 j widows, 89 ; men- 
fervants, 308; women-fervants, 321; tradefmen, fuch as 
tailors, weavers, flboe or brogue makers, fmiths, wrights, 
coopers, cowans *, 73. There is only one dyer, and two 
gardeners, and three merchants. The number of day-la- 
bourers cannot be afcertained. There are indeed feveral 
who work for daily hire, fometimes in the year ; but they 
are not many who are ftated ones, or make day-labour 
their bufinefs by which they fupport themfelves and fami- 
lies. I would conjecture the number of thofe who live by 
day-labour to be about 50 ; and of thofe who make it only 
a bye-job, or a bufinefs now and then as they are difpofed, 
or find it necefiary, to be about thrice that number. Be- 
lides the above, there is a great number of fpinners for the 
linen-manufa£tures in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. This 
number is as difficult to afcertain as the former, and for the

fame reafon ; I would fuppofe the whole to be about 400. 
All the families above ftated, excepting thofe of tradefmen, 
day-labourers, &amp;c. are farmers, tenants, fubtenants, cotta- 
gers. 

Births, Marriages, Burials. — The annual average of 
births, marriages, burials, cannot be afcertained with any- 
tolerable accuracy. By examining the regifter, I found 
there were 80 baptifms and 24 marriages recorded from 
January 1789 to January 1790-, but I much fufpect their 
number ought to have been more; and I have reafon for 
this fufpicion, becaufe fome few may be baptifed, and fome 
few married by the miftionary in this parifh, and the neigh- 
bouring clergymen, whofe names might have been ne- 
glected to be reported to the feffion-ckrk. This circum- 
stance, together with fome who die unbaptiCed, and who 
are not therefore reported and recorded, may well account 
for this miftake. Indeed, thefe numbers of baptifms and 
marriages exceed what they were in the fame fpace of 
time for feveral years before, according to the regifter. 
From thefe very probable circumftances, I may fafely con- 
clude the annual average of births for a few years paft to 
be about 85, and that of marriages about 28. The number 
of deaths or burials I found on the regifter in the period 
above mentioned to be 24, which is by no means fatisfac- 
tory, and puts it entirely out of my power to afcertain the 
precife average, efpccially when it is confidered, that in 
order to elude payment of the tax, numbers ufe all the mifts 
they can ; befides, there are no lefs than 10 burial places 
in the panib, which gives numbers an ample opportunity 
to efcape from both regifter and tax.

ftafe. Many of thofe that have, were already connderec! 
and anticipated in whole or in part, as they occurred occa- , 
fionally in treating of other articles. Therefore all that is 
neceHary is to give a fhort account of fuch particulars as 
have not been anticipated, and may apply to this parifh. 

Well then, we have no manufactures, no artifts, and but 
few mechanics. All the inhabitants are of the Eftabliihed 
Church, yet many attempts have been made to introduce Se- 
ceffion among them. They are, on the whole, moderate and 
rational in their religious principles, puntfual in their attend- 
ance on divine ordinances, and well difpofed to encourage 
and fupport the means of religious inftruction among them- 
None, for many years pad, have died of famine or want : 
nay, in the late fevere and unfavourable years, when the 
country was threatened with famine, nothing like it was 
feen or heard in this parifh • yet the effefts of thefe unhap- 
py feafons are ftill felt, and will be felt for fome time to- 
come : So fatal a ftroke it then received, that from it we 
may date a kind of revolution in manners and circumftan- 
ces. No murders have been committed for many years 
pad ; yet fecret grudges and animofities ftill prevail, and 
often times break out into quarrels and broils, at markets 
and meetings, which wear a dreadful appearance, and fome- 
times are attended with difagreeable confequences ; but a 
great deal of this is to be imputed to the too free ufe of 
fpiritous liquors on thefe occafions,, which inflames their 
blood, and exafperates their fpirits. As to child-murder, 
in particular, it is fcarcely known in this pariih, and long 
may it be fo. I never heard of any inftance of fuicide but 
one, which happened about 18 years ago, and it is to be 
hoped will not happen fo foon again ; yet I am forry to 
fay, that of late years there were in the country two or 
three inftances of that deteflable and melancholy practice. 
I have no doubt but many leave this pariih and country 

either

either for want of employment, or for the fake of getting 
better. But I am perfuaded, that numbers leave it wan- 
tonly, who, if they were difpofed to exercife fobriety and 
induftry, as they muft do abroad, might find a competency 
of bread and employment at home. It is, however, very 
much to be regretted, to what caufe foever it may be owing, 
that a fpirit of emigration prevails too much of late years 
for the conferences of it are, year after yoar, more and 
more feverely felt by the country at large, but more efpe- 
cially by the farmers and tenants. That ufeful and necef- 
fary clafs of people, had fcarcely thefe two laft years, the 
complement of fervants they would need, becaufe they ei- 
ther could not get them for any wages, or if they could, 
yet their demand was too high, and perhaps their work fo 
little, that they were not able to engage them. I deny 
not, but fervants ought to have all due encouragement 
when they deferve it neither do I think, that in this coun- 
try they have more than they would need : but I affirm, 
that in the prefent ftate of things, the farmer is not able to 
afford it and keep credit. The demands of the landlord, 
which are not leffening, the expence of living, which is a 
third more at leaft than it was 20 years ago, together with 
the other expences that attend the working of his farm, 
which are alfo daily growing more, all thefe are of them- 
felves too heavy for all the produce of the farm, and his 
other fliifts to anfwer them, though he had no other bur- 
den. All thefe things confidered, I believe in my heart, 
that the farmer is the greateft dupe and Have in the coun- 
try ; and while he is fo, the country cannot thrive, efpe- 
cially fince the whole traffick and credit of it is yet found- 
ed on no other bottom but the produce of the field. Let 
all concerned be wife and confider this. 

Yet, after all, I think it very practicable to improve 
farms, to make the circumftances of the farmer comfortable, 

to

o g.ve all due encouragement to fervants, and, in a word, 
to remove aU thefe grievances, without any diminution of 
rents or palling from the value of cuftoms and fervices. 
Thefe are things which the landlord confuiers, though in- 
deed fa fely, as great advantages, and will therefore by no 
means difpenfe with them. Well then, to gratify him, I 
do * ot think that there is any neceffity to cede the value 
. or fervices, Vc. or any advantage he derives at prefent 
from the farmer; all that is required is to pafs from the 
fences, and fome other articles in kind, and to take real 
Value for them by commutation or converfion. This if 
matters were duly coniidered, will be found neceiTary • 
and as rt is neceiTary, fo it could be eafily accomplilhed. 
It may be compenfated in fuch a way, as will redound 
much to the mutual credit and advantage of both landlord 
and tenant. If this were once effected, it would be attended 
with another important advantage. It would make the 
tenants more frugal and induftrious, and improve their fen- 
timents and morals ; and what would greatly contribute to 
this reformation, is the prcfpeft they would have of reap- 
ing and enjoying the fruit of their own labours, more efpe- 
cially if they held their tacks on longer leafes, which would 
be alio neceiTary in ending fo defirable a change. Where- 
as their prefent ftate and circumftances, have a manifeft ten- 
dency to deprefs their fpirits, to check their ardour for di- 
ligence and induflry, to contracT the heart, to cherilh the 
felliih principle in all its meannefs, and of courfe, all man- 
ner of fraud, cunning and diffimulation, which, I am forry 
to fay, have made confiderable progrefs of late years. There 
are no flated or licenfed taverns in the parilh but one, 
which fcarcely deferves the name ; but there are feveral 
families, who retail whilky and ale occafionally. This 
praaice prevails too much, and is attended with many con- 
fluences hurtful to the intereil and morals of the people; 

and 



of Halkirk. 



and it were to be wilhed that it had been fuppreffed. Be- 
fides, of late years, fince diftillation prevailed fo much, the 
ufe of whifky has almoft fuperfeded that of ale, which about 
forty years ago was the ordinary drink, both ' in taverns 
and private houfes, and not near fo hurtful and inconve- 
nient to the people. The heavy duty on malt, contributed 
not a little to this difagreeable circumftance, by which 
means this beverage, fo ufeful and convenient to the coun- 
try people, when ufed in moderation, is in danger of being 
at laft entirely in difufe, and no drink will be relifhed but 
what directly intoxicates the braifi and inflames the blood. 

The ufual hire of a day-labourer is almoft double what 
it was about 20 years ago. This is both natural and rea- 
fonable, becaufe, as has been already obferved, the expence 
of living has greatly increafed in that period. It is various, 
according to the various jobs' in which they are employed. 
The average here, per day, I would eftimate at 9 d. ; and 
the fum necefTary to fupport a family, confifting of man, 
wife, and 4 children, per week, at 3 s. 6 d. Both the hire 
and the expence of living are yearly very much on the in- 
creafe. The farmer is the only man who will fuffer moll 
by this progrefs, if he will not have more advantages than 
he has at prefent to keep pace with it. We have rather 
too many who are idly difpofed, and who will not work, 
unlefs compelled to it by the extremity of the laft necef- 
fity ; for if they happen to have what will enable them to 
hold it out until night, or any profpect of any other fhift, 
though at the expence of their more induftrious neighbours, 
to whom they are no fmall burden, they have no concern 
about their debts, or any provifion for to-morrow. Though 
thefe are a grievance to the country, yet the Britifti army 
is much indebted to them ; and, indeed, if this is a relief 
to themfelves, it is no fmall one to their neighbours, who 
*re glad to be free of fuch idle and ufelefs drones. From 
t tins

this caufe, and the vices to which it is an inlet, as well as 
from other canfes which are more neceffary and unavoid- 
able, it happens that we have a great number of poor. But 
vvhat is much to be regretted is, that a confiderable part of 
this number confifts of tenants who have been reduced, 
either by the late unfavourable feafons, or by the infuffi- 
ciency of their farms, and other Ihifts, with all their in- 
duitry and frugality, to provide for the evil day. The 
number at prefent on the roll is 150; but it ought to have 
been near double that number, were all thofe who are in 
indigent circumftances to be admitted. So very low are 
the fefiion-funds, that none can be admitted on the roll but 
the greateft objects, or fuch as are extremely indigent ; and 
even, m that cafe, they are not in the fmalleft degree ade- 
quate to that number; for the only fources of our funds 
are the Sabbath colle^ons, and the fines arifing from de- 
linquencies. The former is very trifling, more efpecially 
becaufe our men of money are not thofe who moft fre- 
quently come to church. The latter, though more frequent 
than could be wifiied, yet it turns out to no great account, 
becaufe, though they are very fubjeft to thefe delinquencies, 
they are yet on the whole very poor in purfe. They are 
able to fin, but not able, had they been willing, to pay. 
It is a pity that the civil arm does not interpofe its autho- 
rity, and the gentry their influence and example, as could 
be wilhed, to ftrengthen the hands of the clergy in the fup- 
preffion of thefe deftru&amp;ive practices. But to return to the 
poor : At the annual diftribution of the funds, the ftiare of 
each individual poor on the roll, is no more, at an average, 
thr,n 2 s. af the utmoft. This, and the inefficiency of the 
parifli to fupply their needs, is one great caufe why num- 
bers of them wander about, begging that charity which they 
cannot get at home. 

It

It has been already obferved, that the foil and climate of 
this parilh and country, do not feem favourable to the pro- 
duftion of trees. Yet, I believe, if proper methods had 
been ufed, and due attention given to that neceffary article, 
fome kinds of timber might thrive pretty well. But there 
are other kinds, which, in my opinion, will fruftrate every 
attempt to rear them. Of this kind is the fir, as was alfo 
fpecified before. Yet it is certain that there was great 
abundance of that timber once in this parilh. This mani- 
feftly appears from the remains of it that are ftill to be feera 
in feveral parts of the parilh, and indeed of the whole 
country. From this circumftance it would be naturally 
concluded, that where that timber grew fo well, and fo 
ftately of old, without the aid of care or art, it would furely 
grow there now, with the conjoined affiftance of both art 
and nature. This is a paradox I will not pretend to folve, 
though yet I am very much inclined to think, that it is to 
be attributed to fome change or revolution that has taken 
place in the climate, and confequently. in the foil, from, 
their mutual influence on one another. To corroborate 
this opinion I would remark, that about 23 years ago, there 
were two or three fmall woods of birch and mountain afli, 
\§c. in a very blooming and vigorous ftate, in this and a 
neighbouring parifb, which are now almoft wholly decayed 
and withered root and branch. This reverfe is, no doubt, 
in a great meafure to be afcribed to the depredations of the 
country people, who cannot withhold their hands from 
growing timber, wherever their eyes behold it. But from 
this reverfe, in fo Ihort a time, it feems to be principally 
occafioned by the late unfavourable feafons, which have 
proven as noxious to them as to other vegetables, and more 
fo, becanfe, as was before obferved, they are not raifed out 
of the earth, as other vegetables are, at the end of the fea- 
fon. Does not this circumftance render it at leaft probable 

that 



32 Statlflical Account 

^tTT d6Ca r nd t0 &amp;™ fmce, is 

• owing to fuch a revolution of climate and foil as took place 

at that period ? And what makes for this ftiU further, a „d 
add, to the probability of it, is another circumftance, JL 
the feafons are colder, the earth more wet, the crops not 
near fo good, fome animals, fuch as the wild bee, the fwal- 
low, fcarcely to be feen fince that fatal period ; and not 
only fo, fome vegetables that anfwered very well before 
do not grow now at all with the greateft attention and in- 
dultry. 

I would alfo further remark, as it now occurs to me, and 
applies to the prefent purpofe, that when there is a current 
of air from the fea, accompanied with mift and fog, it en- 
velopes all the vegetable creation as far as it advances with 
a flimy, faline kind of dew, which is often from one end 
of the country to the other ; for I believe there is no place 
in this country, that is above 9 miles in a ftraight line from 
the fea, which fufrounds it clofe on every quarter but the 
S. and S. W. This dew, when applied to the tongue and 
palate, has a very faltifh relifh ; fo I have experienced once 
in the centre of the country ; nay, at that time, and in that 
place, I felt the fcent of rotten ware, as fenfibly aim oft as 
if I had been on the more at that time. This circumftance 
muft furely have a confiderable influence on trees, and the 
other produce of the foil, and this is the caufe of my ma- 
king this remark. But before I clofe thefe obfervations, 
I would further remark, that our winters are in proportion 
more temperate than the other feafons of the year. Whe- 
ther this has been the cafe of old I cannot fay. 

Ploughs, Carts, Horjes, Oxen for the Farm.— The plough 
ufed in this parifh, and indeed in all the country, not very 
many years ago, was of very fimple connrudtton, very 
cheap, very eafily and fpeedily made ; it had only one 

rtiltj 



of Halkirk. 33 

ftilt ; by this it was managed and conduced by the plough- 
man, with his right hand only, and clofe at his right thigh; 
it had fcarcely a fide board •, though, for thefe reafons, it 
was very uneafy for the ploughman, yet it was very light 
and eafy for the cattle. It ploughed very well, and eafy, 
as I am informed ; broke the earth as it turned it, ferved 
the purpofe of a firft harrowing as it went along, and good 
crops were raifed after it. For fome time paft there is none 
of them to be feen ; for thofe now ufed are much the fame 
with thofe ufed in the fouth of Scotland. Thefe are, in- 
deed, more eafy for the ploughman, yet not fo for the cat- 
tle, becaufe they are heavier, and plough deeper, Ifc. 

The long yoke, as we call it, or two and two a-breaft, be- 
fore one another, is not ufed but by very few, and that oc- 
cafionally. The old mode of four a-breaft, or (hort yoke, 
as we call it, is ftill the faftiion. This, however, though 
not fo eafy and fafe for the driver, who goes retrograde in 
the furrow, with two on each fide of him, is, I believe, 
more advantageous for the cattle than the other. For, in 
draughts of every kind, it is very much in favour of the 
drawing power to be near the centre of motion. This is 
manifeftly the cafe in the lhort yoke, all the cattle being 
equally near the plough, and having confequently an equal 
lhare of the draught. The only difadvantage arifing from 
it, befides the danger to which the driver is expofed, is, 
that two of the cattle draw on the tilled ground, and there- 
by trample it, which is both uneafy to them, and hurtful 
to the ground ; but thefe are nothing when compared to 
the other advantages. 

It is only of late years alfo that carts began to be ufed. 
Now the great advantage of them is feen and felt, and 
the ufe of them is daily becoming more and more general. 
They are increafing in number every year, efpecially as 
we have the profpeft of good roads. Since carts be-

came 



34 Statijlical Account 

came fo general, I am perfuaded, that one half of the trou- 
ble, of the time, and of the expence, is faved, which was 
formerly bellowed on the article of carriage alone. 

F urther, the cattle ufed not many years ago for the pur- 
pofes of the farm, and carriages of all kinds, were for the 
moft part horfes. This is ftill much the practice ; yet oxen 
are, of late years, more and more ufed for thefe purpofes, 
efpecially lince horfes are become fo expenfive in the rear- 
ing, and fo dear in the purchafe. 

The prefent ftate of thefe articles is as follows :— Ploughs, 
312; carts of different fizes, 220; horfes, 580; of this 
number there are 30 large, or of the Galloway lize ; the 
reft are of different fizes, but in general rather fmall : oxen, 
294 ; of thefe there are 40 of pretty large lize, all the reft 
fmall, or of inferior fizes. 

Produce of the Par{fh, An'wial and Vegetable.-r-Kviwsx'nX 
produce is horfes, black cattle, fheep, goat, fvvine, geefe. 
Moft of the horfes bred here are of the fmall garron kind, 
and many of them fold at 2 or 3 years old. But moft of 
thofe employed in work, &amp;c. are purchafed at a dear rate 
from other places, efpecially from the Orkneys^ where our 
young horfes are bought for the purpofes of rearing and 
fale. Hence it is, that the very fame horfes which were 
fold by us at very low prices, are fometimes, 2 or 3 years 
afterwards, rebought by the fame perfons, who fold them 
before, at three times the original price. This is furely a 
mode of traffick very un frugal, and much againft the inte- 
reft of the country. 

Black Cattle. — There is a great number of thefe reared 
in this parilh, being well calculated for it, as being fur- 
nilhed with good pafture, both lowland and highland. But 
yet I am perfuaded, that the number reared is near one- 
third more than it ought to have been, or the pariih ca,n

well maintain. This is the caufe why our cows do not 
ufually yield fo much milk as might be expected ; why 
that cattle are in general more poor, and of lefs iize than 
they might have been ; and confequently, why they fetch 
fuch low prices at markets. But what is their motive for 
this unfrugal and miftaken plan ? Why, becaufe the com- 
merce in that cattle is a principal and necefiary article of 
credit; and confequently, they calculate their flock, ac- 
cording to their number, and not according to their quality. 
Befides, having no other way fo ready to maintain credit, 
and to anfwer Martinmas demands, they pinch their fami- 
lies in the necefTary food arifing from thefe animals, from 
an overweening expe&amp;ation, and the miltaken idea, that if 
they have plenty of calves, they will be able to anfwer thefe 
demands, which hang a mighty terror over their heads 
every year. Thus it happens, that they themfelves, and 
their cattle, are half ftarved, and their ill-founded expec- 
tations often times fruftrated. Whereas, had they adopted 
another plan, and kept an adequate number of cattle only, 
their families would be better fupported, their cattle better 
in quality and value, and the demands of the landlord 
more readily anfwered. 

Sheep. — By appearance there are excellent fheep-paftures 
in this parifh, efpecially in the Highlands ; but in moft 
parts they do not thrive to any fatisfa&amp;ion. This appears 
both from the fmallnefs of the number they generally have, 
and the number of lambs that are yearly bought from other 
countries, for a continual fupply of their own, which never 
increafes, notwithstanding that annual recruit, but often 
grows lefs and lefs. This failure may be attributed to fe- 
veralcaufes-, to the wetnefs and fwampinefs of the foil; to 
their being fed promifcuoufly with other cattle ; to their 
being, for the mofl part, houfed every night, and often 
with other cattle ; to the want of due fkijl and care in ma- 
naging 



36 



Statiftical Account 



naging them ; and, finally, to their being attended to only 
now and then as a bye job ; all which circumftances are 
very hurtful, and inimical to that ufeful, delicate, and pre- 
carious animal. Yet I am perfuaded, that good fheep-farms 
might be eftablilhed, at leaft in fome parts of the pariih, 
efpecially in the Highlands. They are all of a mixed di- 
minutive kind, but very prolific, and excellent eating. I 
cannot fay that their wool is either good, or plenty of its 
kind, which is the caufe that we jare principally fupplied 
with this neceflary article from other places. 

Goat. — This animal is not fo abundant in this pariih as it 
might have been ; for though we have not many rocks or 
places productive of thofe weeds and herbs, in which they 
moft delight, yet I am informed by thofe who keep them, 
that they thrive very well. 

Swine. — Thefe are very few of late. To what caufe this 
may be owing, I know not; but about 21 years ago this 
end of the pariih fwarmed with them, and they generally 
fold well. They are commonly of a very fmall fize, but 
far better eating, and firmer meat, than a larger kind, and 
by far more ealily reared. There are fome of a large lize, 
but they are very few. 

Geefe. — A conliderable number of this bird was formerly 
reared in this pariih. Now they are but very few in com- 
parifon, which is much to be wondered at, be caufe they 
would fetch now more than double the price they gave 30 
years ? 'ago. 

The prefent ftate of thefe articles, according to the beft 
of my information, is as follows : 

Number of horfes, young and old, including thofe working 



the farms, &amp;c. - 1650- 

Of black cattle, including the work oxen, - 4963 

Of Iheep, - 2890 

Of goats, - - - 13a

Vegetable 



of Halkirk. 37 

Vegetable Produce.— The great, and indeed almoft the 
only vegetable produce, are bear and oats. Thefe are fown 
in continual alternate rotation, without the intervention of 
any other crop. This pradice muft furely be unfavour- 
able to the field, the crop, the quality of the grain, and ex- 
pofe the farmer to more trouble and expence, for reafons 
well known. No great attempts have yet been made to 
raife peafe and green crops, fuch as turnips, ifc. Yet I 
have reafon to think, from the good fuccefs that attended 
the few trials which have been made, that they would 
profper well. It is, indeed, great matter of furprife, that, 
in a parifh where the fupport and credit of the people al- 
moft entirely depends on their cow and their grain, they 
Ibould deny themfelves this great advantage. For, befides 
the benefits that would be derived from thefe crops to 
themfelves and their cattle, they would moreover enable 
them to keep a greater number of cattle, which they would 
like well, and occafion that rotation of crops fo much wanted 
for the benefit of the field, and its produce. Want of inclo- 
fures and winter-herding are, as has been already obferved, 
two great caufes why the people do not avail themfelves of 
this great advantage. Befides, being unaccountably averfe to 
any thing that is ftrange or novel in this way, they cannot 
be perfuaded to truft their credit and their profpe&amp;s to fuch 
crops. Great quantities of potatoes are indeed of late years 
raifed in this parifh, from which they derive very confi- 
derable advantages, efpecially as they contribute much to 
make the living cheaper. 

Oats. — The oats raifed generally is of two kinds, black and 
grey, of a fmall body, very prolific, but not productive of any 
great proportion of meal. In fome parts of the parilh, in good 
years, the proportion is more than 9 ftones of meal out

kinds of black oats are raifed, and a confiderable quantity 
of white kinds. Yet, though thefe yield more meal, they 
are found not t Q be well calculated for this fail, nor fo pro- 
Stable. However, by the bye, I know not but this may 
be as much owing to miftaken notions, and a predileftion 
in favour of old ufages, as to any other caufe. 

Bear—The bear, for the moft part, is in fome degree in- 
fenorm. quality to that of more fouthern counties: Yet, 
in good years, and in the moft fertile fpots of the parifli, it 
weighs between 17 and 18 ftones /*rboll. In any year it 
is reckoned preferable to any that grows almoft in this 
county. The returns of it, in growth, are various, being 
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 at the utmoft. Yet, eftimated at an ave- 
rage, the whole crop, bear and oats, does not much exceed 
4 returns. But, I believe, that with more pains and in- 
duftry, and proper encouragement and example to infufe 
that fpirit into the people, the crop might be confiderably 
meliorated ; however, in good years, the produce is con- 
fiderably more than is necefTary for the fupport of the 
parifti in its prefent ftate. The whole amount in bear and 
oat meal, at an average, according to the beft of my enquiry 
and calculation, is about 15,500 bolls, the boll of meal at 
8f ftones. 

Prices of Vi&amp;ual, and other Neceffaries of Life. — The ave- 
rage price of victual, I mean of bear and meal, for we have 
no other, is, for fome years paft, 13 s. 4 d. per boll ; of 
good beef, 2\ d. per lb. ; of mutton and pork, when good, 
the fame j of geefe, fold at Martinmas, is. 4 d. per goofe ; 
of heris, 6 d. each ; of eggs, 2 d. per dozen ; of Iheep hogs 
or wedders, 7 s. per hog ; of fwine, 12 s. each. There are 
fome of them that fell confiderably below, and fome confi- 
derably above that price, according to their quality and 
fize ; of an ordinary cow or ox, for flaughter, and in flefh,

Commerce and Traffick. — The principal fubjecls of com- 
merce in this parifh, as already obferved, are the articles 
juft now mentioned. As to horfes, very few of them could 
be fpared for fale, if thofe who rear them had patience to 
keep them until they would be fit for work, b'c. There- 
fore they fell them at two years old, as mentioned above, 
at low prices, and buy others, fit for work, at very high 
rates--, fo that there is no gain, but rather great lofs by this 
branch of commerce. As to black cattle, I believe, that, 
communibus annis, about 1000 of them are fold between the 
butcher and the drover. As to victual, I believe they can 
export, at an average, in good years, about i8co bolls, and 
fupport themfelves ; but this export, as I am informed, is 
not fo much as it was in former years. The decline in 
crops, the increafe of people notwithstanding the improve- 
ments made of late years, and the bear confumed by whifky 
and diftillation, may well account for this circumftance. 
As to whifky, 1 believe 2-3ds of it is confumed in the 
country, a great part of thefe 2-3ds in this fame parifh, and 
confequently, that fcarcely i-3d of that liquor is exported. 
Not many years ago, there were no lefs than 13 or 14 fmall 
diftilleries in this parifh, and on the near confines of it ; 
at prefent, fince the late acl;, there are only 4, which I think 
is enough, confidering all the good that is reaped from, 
them.

Heritors and Proprietors.—^* heritors and proprietors 
are not fo many as they were a few years ago. The num. 
ber, at prefent, is 6. Sir John Sinclair of Ulbfter is the 
principal, being proprietor of,much more than one half of the 
parifh, and fuperior of a confiderable part of it befides his 
own property. He is alfo patron of the parifh. 

Ecclejiqftical State. — The prefent incumbent is Mr John 
Cameron, who was admitted in September 1769. He 
married 20th December 1782 •, is a widower from January 
5. 1784 -, has one daughter, an only child, born 5th De- 
cember 1783. His immediate predeceflbrs were Mr Wil- 
liam Abernethy, Mr William Cumming, Mr John Munro, 
who was the firft Prefbyterian Minifter, Mr John Suther- 
land, Mr James Nicolfon. The ftipend, in Mr Cumming's 
time, was fcarcely, at the then viclual-converfion, L. 35 
Sterling. It was augmented in Mr Munro's time to about 
L. 50 Sterling, at the then converfion. He had only 2 
chalders of viflual in his ftipend ; yet fmall as was this fti- 
pend, he lived very comfortably, and made a fuitable pro- 
vifion for his family, which was numerous. His eldeft fon 
was the late Sir George Munro of Pointsfield. His two 
immediate predeceflbrs, who had much fmaller ftipends, 
and families to fupport and provide for, did the fame alfo. 
So great was the value of money, and fo many were the 
advantages of thofe days befides what they are now. The 
prefent ftipend, which was augmented iith December 1776, 
is 2 chalders of meal and 2 chalders of bear, L. 600 Scotch, 
and L. 30 Scotch for communion-elements. 

The manfe and church, during the prefent incumbency, 
have always been in a bad ftate of repair, and extremely 

inconvenient

inconvenient, though repaired four times, and at confider- 
able expence during that period, m%. 23 years. The laft 
of thefe repairs is going on juft now, at the efti mated fum 
of L. 154 Sterling ; and as foon as the undertaker puts them 
off his hands, they will call for another immediate repair, 
whether the minifter calls for it or not. It is to be regretted, 
that heritors, from a miftaken notion of faving their purfes, 
fhould fo unaccountably injure their own intereft, and in- 
commode the minuter, when both might have been avoided 
with little expence. 

The glebe is, on the whole, very good land, but confi- 
derably Abort of the minimum. It only fows 3 bolls bear, 
iuppofing all of it to be fown with that grain, and will not 
graze one cow. There is reafon to believe that it was lar- 
ger, and that it was curtailed by the encroachments or de- 
predations of the conterminous tenants in time of vacancies, 
and never yet enquired into. This is the more credible, 
from the report of a very old member of this prefby tery, 
dead feveral years ago, who informed the prefent incum- 
bent that this was the cafe, for that he faw the decreet of 
designation by Birtjop John Forbes, of this diocefe, in the 
cuilody of Mr Munro above mentioned. 

Miflion and MiJ/lon-hovfe, lifi, — Betides the church, there 
is a meeting or miflion-houfe, in the Highlands of the pa- 
nfh, at the diftance of 9 miles from the church, where the 
minifter of the pariih was wont to preach every 4th Sab- 
bath as a voluntary deed, if not prevented by bad weather, 
or fpeats in the waters, which are too frequent, efpecially 
in winter. The houie is pretty large, was built, and is 
ftill fupported by the. inhabitants of that diftrift of the pa- 
rim, for their own and the minifter's accommodation, at 
very confiderable expence for them. Of late years, they 
have a mi.ffionary fupported at their own expence alfo. It

is true, indeed, that the Committee of the Royal Bounty 
fometimes granted a little for their relief; and the fame j» 
continued juft now, but the further continuance of it is un- 
certain and precarious. The Society for Propagating Chri- 
stian Knowledge,, fince the late increafe of their funds, have 
been often folicited and importuned to extend the benefit 
of their mftitution to that remote corner, that (lands fo much 
m need of it, and fo well deferves it, by the exertions made 
by the people, beyond their abilities, to fupport the means 
of innru£lion among them. But all hitherto has been to no 
purpofe. Yet there are millions eftabli(hedy the faid So- 
ciety in other places, which do. not fo much need them. 
However, it is flill hoped, that this defirable object will be 
obtained, as foon as the Honourable Society will have a 
proper view of the utility and neceffity of it. Here, it 
mould be obferved, that an excellent dwelling-houfe was 
very lately built by fubfcription, in order to encourage the 
miffionary, and to aflift the people, and with the profpeft 
that a perpetual million was to be eftabliftied there *. 

Scbook.— -There are two fchools in the parifti, a parochial 
and a Society one. As to the former, it is always throng 
of fcholars, and is taught by an excellent mafter ; but the 
fmallnefs of the falary, which is but a trifle more than L. 6* 
and the want of proper accommodations for teaching, are. 
mighty hinderances and difcouragements. Thefe grie- 
vances were reprefented, laftyear, to Sir John Sinclair, who 
immediately gave powers to the minifter to get the accom- 
modations of a fchool-houfe and delks as foon as poffihle, in 
the firft place, and that he would pay his quota of the ex- 
pence on demand ; and this he would have done, but fome 
of the heritors refufed to contribute their (hare, wfyich 
would be but very trifling, and fo the matter (lands, which

is a pity ; for next to the boroughs, it is iri the mod cen- 
trical and commodious place for a flouriming fchool in the 
whole county. 

As to the other fchool, it is always full alfo, and am- 
bulatory for the accommodation of this extenfive and po- 
pulous parifh ; yet two-thirds almoft of the parifh reap no 
Taenefit from it, not only becaufe of their diftance from the 
ftatioh, but alfo becaufe it is difficult of accefs to many, who 
may be nearer hand, moft feafons of the year. Thefe cir- 
cumftances render another fchool of the fame kind wecef- 
fary in the Highlands, if it could be obtained. Applica- 
tions are making for it, and it is hoped that they will be 
attended with fuccefs ; for never have the Society applied 
their funds to a more ufeful and neceffary pu'rpofe." 

Antiquities, U'c. — There are feveral veftiges of antiquity 
in this parifh, fome of which are to be feen by the eye, and 
fome to be heard of by the ear, from oral tradition. But 
neither what is to be feen or heard, furnifh a key, whereby 
the truth can be fo inveftigated as to afford any great in- 
ftru&amp;ion or amufement. The remains that are vifible 
make, indeed, awful and pleafant impreffions on the mind 
of the beholder, and fuggeft to him a confufed, but majeftic 
idea of what they once have been : yet they, at the fame 
time, affedl him with pain, becaufe the eagernefs of his cu- 
riofity cannot be gratified. The avenues that lead up to 
the objed of his ardent purfuit and defire are clofed on

A veil of obfcurity intercepts his view, and eclipfes the

%o oral tradition, hoping to find accefs by that quarter. 
Alas ! tradition is too much the work of fancy. Like Ho- 
mer's Iliad, it may amufe as a pleafant dream, but can give 
him as little authenticated information ofthe truth, as that 
poem can give of ancient Troy, and the fiege of it, which 
.Ifuppofe was as confuted a ftory in that poet's time, as 
that of. thefe antiquities, and. gave equal play and fcope to 
the imagination. Where now will the antiquarian turn 
himfelf ? He betakes himfelf to the hiftorical page. There 
he may find fomething like the object of his enquiry and 
tvith; but it is too vague and. general, too much clothed 
with the brilliant drapery of f^cj ; and fo, if he be not a 
dupe to credulity, he muft llili remain dir C ontented and un- 
fatished. This is actually my cafe. How then can I fatif- 
fy others, , when I cannot get myfelf fatisfied ? However, 
I will attempt it, at all adventures, and do what 1 can. 

The fertility and extent of the corn-fields, the richnefs 
and variety of the paflures in this parifh, both highland and 
lowland, the traces of antiquity that Hill remain ; all thefe 
evidently point it out as holding, from early date, a di- 
fiinguifhed rank in this country, in regard of people and 
events, which would amply reward the memory of the hi- 
storian, had they not efcaped his notice. I myfelf, this mo- 
ment, when I am at a lofs for information, could I but find 
a proper hiftorian on the fubject, would have faid, Peace to 
his foul. But fince it is not fo, what I fee and hear other- 
wife tempt me to grop and fearch in the dark, and I Ihall 
be happy if any corredl me with the light of authenticity 
and truth. 

EcchfLaJllcal Antiquities,— cMm my attention, in the 
firft place. Among thefe, the religious houfe that was at 
£pm-il is the moft diftingnifhed. This houle, it is certain, 
Was origira. y ;oundcd ar.d endowed by a St Magnus of 

Orkney, 



of Halkirk. 



45 



Orkney, and dedicated to that Saint, therefore called §t 
Magnus. Who he was, I have not yet been able to learn ; 
but, from feveral circumftances, I have reafon to believe, 
that he was either a Dane or of Danifh extraction ; and 
that he aflumed the name Magnus, on his becoming fo emi- 
nently diftinguimed in the church. Whatever he was, it 
appears that he was a great and a good man, a perfonage 
of great wealth and influence, of no lefs piety and benefi- 
cence, and highly beloved and revered, efpecially in this 
country and in the Orkneys, where he has done fo much good. 
From this circurnftance it is, that there are ftill fo many 
in thefe countries called Magnus. Circumftances alfo lead 
to the belief, that he was one of the Knights Templars, fo 
powerful and affluent in their day, and a capital one too, 
and confeqnently, that the lands in the neighbourhood of 
5pittal Hill, to a confiderable extent in this and the parifti 
of Watten, were the property of that fociety. What 
makes this the more credible is, that there is fcarcely a 
pariih in Scotland wBere that fociety have not had lands, 
and eftablimed religious houfes. Nay, fo much did their 
influence and wealth accumulate, that it was their ruin at 
laft. They were envied and dreaded by both church and 
laity, who coveted their wealth. Hence this order was ex- 
tinguilhed very early in the 14th century, deprived of their 
wealth, and a large mare of it transferred to the order of 
St John of Jerufalem, who alfo were treated in the fame 
manner, as loon as their affluence made them ripe for the 
rapacious hand of covetoufnefs But to return from this 
digreflion, which I could not well avoid. 

Why this religious houfe was called Spittal, Hofpi- 
tal, I cannot learn * ; neither can I find what kind of reli- 
gious 

♦ Some people imagine, that thofe religious buildings were called 
Hofp.Uls, or Spittuls, becaufc they furnifhed fheker and bo/fitalrty to

gious were admitted to it, or what were the particular 
rules and orders obferved by them, or, finally, at what pe- 
riod of time it was founded, or when it was demolilhed. 
But, from the charafter of the original founder, for no doubt 
there were large donations made to it after him, from this 
character, I fay, and from the name of the houfe, vix. Spit- 
tal, it is more than probable that it was ereaed and en- 
dowed principally for the maintenance and inuruclion of 
the poor religious ; or, at leaft, that there was an apartment 
for the reception of mendicants, who were entertained on 
the funds of that boufe, as was ufually the cafe in thefe re- 
ligiouseftablimments. Circumftances alfo render it probable, 
that the houfe was ftripped and demolimed in the reign of 
James VI. or perhaps Mary. That the number admitted to 
it, and retained in it, was great, is very certain ; and it is no 
lefs certain, that the revenues of it were very confiderable 
alfo •, for, befides other circumftances too tedious to men- 
tion, there is one, which feems to me to put this beyond 
all doubt, vix. that the church was very large and capa- 
cious, being fome feet broader, and feveral feet longer than 
theprefent pariah-church, which is among the largeft in 
thefe northern counties • as alfo, that there were feveral 
houfes round it, which furely were the cells or habitations 
of thefe religious, fome of which, as appears from their ve- 
ftiges, were large alfo. Befides thefe, there were other 
houfes of the fame nature, for the accommodation of the 
lame eftablifhmenr, at a further diftance ; more particularly, 
there was a very large one, at a place on a rifing ground to 
the weft of the church, called Auchinarras, that is, the

there is a farm called Achaclioal, or Acha Choirl, (that is, the field of 
the meeting of council, or multer), where the people of Caithnefs, in 
former times, frequently aflembled together.

Field of the Altar. From all which it appears, that the 
revenues of the houfe, and the number of religious retained 
in it, were very confiderable. There is a report prevalent 
in this country, that all the inhabitants of Caithnefs afem- 
bled there periodically, as a place of rendezvous, being the 
mofl elevated and centrical in the county, and that the 
ohurch contained them all. This may feem a hyperbole, 
a figure always attending vulgar report. But, in my opi- 
nion, with a little qualification, it is not altogether irrecon- 
cileable to truth. For, fuppofe the kirk could not hold 
them all, yet it would contain many of them, and the hou- 
fes and cells round it, I am perfuaded, would hold the fur- 
plus ; more efpecially, when it is confidered, that the 
people were then far lefs in number, and that they were 
only perfons above a certain age that mull have affembled, 
there on thefe occafions. 

The lands about that houfe were about 130 years ago in 
the poffeffion of the Murrays of Pennyland in this country, 
which makes me fufpecl that they were derived to that 
family from a Gilbert Murray, Bilhop of Sutherland and 
Caithnefs, who made, in his day, a capital figure in church 
and Mate, and who, it is probable, got thefe lands either by 
purchafe, or by donation from the church, after the extinc- 
tion of that order and that houfe. It was annexed to the 
diocefe of Orkney, and is ftill on the Exchequer books as 
a part of that diocefe. 

The church of Skinnan was a large, coarfe, mafly build- 
ing, as indeed was that of St Magnus, dedicated to a St 
Thomas, therefore called the church of St Thomas. By 
all accounts it was in Mr Abernethy's incumbency, the 
only church in what we now call the parifh of Halkirk. 
Here the faid Abernethy performed the fundions of his 
office, but his dwelling was at Halkirk. Once, in a Sab- 
bath evening, on his return home from church, he was ac- 
ceded i

cofted by one Mahan Ryan, by name, a ruffian, who lay 
in wait for him at the river, below the caftle of Braal, 
when he fo maltreated him by tumbling him off his horfe 
into the river, and then by blows and fuffocation of water, 
that he was carried home as bruifed and fuffocated to death. 
The villain's motive for this favage treatment, was, as it is 
faid, to be revenged of the minilter for interpofing the au- 
thority of his office, and the difcipline of church-laws, to 
check him, in his career of wickednefs: fo untraceable and 
wild were the people in thefe days. 

Not far from this church was another religious houfe, 
called the Abbey. The remains of it fhew, that it has once 
been a large building. Why it was called the Abbey, who 
was the founder of it, what order of religious inhabited it, and 
when it was founded, and when demolimed, 1 cannot find ; 
but I am certain, from what it appears to have been, that 
it was the receptacle of many devotees, and that the funds 
to fupport it could not be fmall. Nigh this houfe are the 
remains of a fine monumental ftone, that was erected there as 
a memorial of fome interefting event. It was 9 feet high 
above ground. I cannot fay nor find what the particular 
event was. But that it was revered, and facredly preferved, 
as a diftinguifhing mark of fomething momentous, appears 
from hence, that in John Sinclair's time, late of Ulbfter, 
proprietor of that land, a fet of ruffians, broke it wantonly, 
who immediately were purfued by the neighbours ; and on 
their being overtaken, a fcuffle enfued, to which numbers, 
reforted, and was the occafion of bloodlhed. The faid John 
Sinclair, heritable Sheriff of the county, decerned the fa- 
crilegious villains in a fine of a cow the piece, which were 
added to the public funds. Soon afterwards the remains of 
the monument were erected, and inclofed with a ftone dike 
at his own expence, both of which are fince entirely demo- 

liihed.

lifted. It is called by the people to this day, St Thomas's 
Chair. 

Befides thefe, there were feveral chapels, or places of wor- 
fhip, in other parts of the parifh, fome of which feem, from 
what yet appears of them, to have been of fome note in thofe 
days. One at Weftfield, called St Troftan ; one at Olgang- 
beg, called St Peter ; one at Deal ; one at Sibfter ; one at 
Bannifkirk, and feveral more. I can fay nothing about 
them but one thing, vi%. That the church had its own lhare 
largely of this pariih, as indeed the bifhop had of this dio- 
cefe, which made it one of the moft lucrative bifhopricks in 
Scotland *. 

Civil 

* Before I difmifs this article, I would clofe it with a remark, and an 
anecdote. Such was the fuperftitious regard the people paid to thefe 
houfes about 80 years ago, that there was fcarcely any who was married, 
or delivered of child, or was fuccefsful in any eriterprife, or refcued from 
any danger, but embraced the firft opportunity,' after fuch events, uf re- 
pairing to one or other of thefe facrcd houfes, with a large gift or offer- 
ing to the tutelar faint of that particular houl'e. Thefe gifts were a great 
lhare of the emoluments of the clergy in the days of Popery ; and fo fond 
were the people of paying them, in the time of reformation, when there 
was no ghoftly pneft to receive them, that they guzzled arid gormandi- 
zed the meat and drink-oriering themfelves, all along drinking the Saint's 
health. Thus they went fober devotees to vifit the dead Saint, but re- 
turned home perfect Bacchanalians and Epicureans. 

Anecdote.— So lightly were clergy and divine vrorfhip efteemed foma 
time after tiie Reformation, that in Mr Cumming's days, the laft Epifco- 
palian rainifter in this parifh, there was no finger of Pfalms in church 
but the lettergae, as they called the precentor, and one Tait, gardener 
in Braal. This Tait lung fo loud, and with fuch a large open mouth, 
that a young fellow, of the name of Iverach, was tempted to throw a 
Imall round ftone into his mouth, whereby his teeth were broke, and his 
fmgin g (topped at once, and he himfelf almoft choaked. Iverach imme- 
diately took to his heels; tbcfjrvice was converted to laughter \ two ot

Civil Antiquities.— Here Braal claims the firft place. It 
is truly a beautiful and princely place, and may with great 
propriety be called the Paradife of Caithnefs. Indeed, it 
would make a figure in any northern county, were it duly 
Improved, for which it is a moft excellent fubjecf in this 
corner of the world. Though very little improvements 
have been made upon it, in comparison of what it deferves, 
yet of old it was a capital feat of the Harolds Earls of 
Caithnefs. The fabric, which is called the Caftle or 
Tower of Braal, Hands on an eminence, at a fin all diftance 
from the river of Thurfo. It is completely fijuare, of a 
very large area, wonderfully thick in the walls, which are 
partly built with clay, partly with clay and mortar mixed, 
and in fome parts with mortar altogether. The ftairs and 
conveyances to the feveral ftories are through the heart of 
the walls. Thefe ftories were all of them floored and 
vaulted with ftones prodigioufly large, as are indeed moft 
of the ftones of the whole fabric. - A great part of it ftill 
remains, is as plumb and firm as ever, and fe ems, from. its 
ftru&amp;ure, to have been very high and ftately ; and what is 
ftrange, the higheft ftones feem to be larger than thofe be- 
low. It furely coft immenfe labour to get fome of them 
up to fuch a height, efpecially in thofe days, when it is to 
be fuppofed, they had no proper machinery for the purpofe. 
The plummet and rule were furely well applied in the pro- 
grefs of the work, but there is not the leaft imprellion of 
block or chififel, which fliews the great antiquity of it. It 
was manifeftly a place of ftrength, as well as of habitation. 

A 



Tait's fons chafed anrl overtook him, and the fcene was clofed with a 
moft defperate fight. This Tait was the progenitor of the Taits in this 
country, and by his hand was planted a very large afh tree in Braal, which 
fell feveral years ago, and there remains, as the fallen monarch of the 
wood, and as a proof how his family would thrive there, if taken care of.

A deep, large, well contrived ditch fecures it on the north; 
and I have reafon to believe, that it was continued down 
to the river, which fecures it on that quarter. It has the 
appearance of being fortified alfo with other outworks, fuch 
as walls, moats, ifc. which have been all demolifhed, when 
the gardens about it were firft planned or enlarged. It is 
not known by whom, or when it was built, though it is 
the current report, that it was built and inhabited by the 
Harolds, who came over here from Denmark, but more 
immediately from Orkney, where they bore a princely 
fway, as well as here. But very ancient as this fabric cer- 
tainly is, there is the remains of another very near it, to 
the fouth, that feems to excel it far in antiquity, and to 
have been not inferior to it in ftrength. Nothing of it re- 
mains, but a huge unfliapely cairn of ltones, which yet in- 
dicate it to have been once a very large and ftrong faftnefs. 
I fufpect that below it are fubterraneous vaults and com- 
munications to other works, necelfary for defence and fecu- 
rity in thofe days of violence and conftant invafion. 

But the beauty of the whole are the remains of a much 
more modern building, which was extremely well begun, 
but never finilhed. It Hands clofe to the bank of the river, 
below the fabrics above mentioned. The delign is cer- 
tainly grand and magnificent, and worthy of its princely 
lite •, and had it been finilhed, it would, in all appearance, 
have been one of the fineft, and molt ftately, and commo- 
dious edifices in the north, according to the ftyle of thofe 
times. The work was carried on a few feet above the 
vaults, which were completely finilhed, and are indica- 
tions of the greatnefs, majefty, and elegance of what was 
to be above them. There, unluckily, the building was 
flopped, and never was refumed or attempted after- 
wards, though what was done already was a very great 
temptation to it,

Though there was abundance of (tones ready at hand, ex- 
cellently calculated for building on any plan, yet to'fuit 
the grandeur and elegance of the defign, vaft numbers of 
large freeftone were brought from the more, at the diftance 
of 8 miles. This carriage was attended with great labour 
and expence, and occafioned the death of feveral men and 
horfes ; and this is very credible, becaufe at that time there 
were no roads ; and if there were, yet there were no carts 
then in ufe, but the tenants behoved to carry them in loads 
on the backs of horfes. In lhort, all things put together, 
fpeedily effe&amp;ed a total mifcarriage of the undertaking, 
and the failure of funds, and left this piece of work as a 
ftanding monument of the undertaker's great fpirit, but of 
his great folly alfo. It was begun by John Sinclair, one of 
the Earls of Caithnefs, diftinguilhed by the mock appel- 
lation of Joh?i the Wajler, but in what year is not known. 

The gardens of Braal mould not here be omitted. They 
have the appearance of antiquity alfo. They are very 
large, very pleafant and beautiful, divided according to the 
variety and tafte required in horticulture, efpecially in this 
country, furrounded with trees,, nurferies, plantations of 
wood, all of them at prefent in a thriving ftate. Very 
confiderable improvements have been, and ftill are made 
upon it by the Ulbfler family, the proprietors, but far lhort 
of what they might have been, and what fo gpod a fubje£t 
deferves. I have it from undoubted authority, that about 
ioo years ago thefe gardens produced a great deal of fruit, 
though of late years that produce has been but trifling. Be- 
fore I clofe this article, I mould obferve, that the fineft and 
earlieft falmon in the kingdom, and in great numbers, could 
be fiflied every feafon of the year, clofe to thefe gardens, 
which would be a great convenience to any family refiding 
there.

Dirlet Cajlle.—Thz next piece of antiquity worthy of 
notice is Dirlet Caftle. It ftands in a very beautiful ro- 
mantic place in the Highlands, called Dirlet, on a round 
high rock, very fteep, almoft perpendicular on all fides. 
The rock and caftle hang over a very deep dark pool, in 
the river Thurfo, which runs clofe by its fide. On each 
fide of the river and the caftle, and very near them, are 
two other rocks much higher, looking down over the caftle, 
with a ftately and lowring majefty, and fencing it on thefe 
fides. By appearance, as well as by accounts, it was a 
place of ftrength in the days of rapine and plunder. For 
further fecurity it had the river on one hand, and a ditch 
on the other, through which the water was conveyed, with 
a draw-bridge. The laft inhabitant was a defcendent of 
the noble family of Sutherland. He was called in Erfe 
the Ruder Dergi that is, the Red Knight. Having been 
denounced a rebel for his oppreffive and violent practices, 
he was apprehended by Mackay of Farr, his own uncle, 
and died on his way to Edinburgh, fome fay to Stirling, to 
be tried for his life. Mackay took pofleflion of his eftate, 
which confided of the lands called the Tenpenny land of 
Braygald, a very fine and lucrative eftate, and his fucceflors 
enjoyed it for a confiderable time. Whether Mackay got 
thefe lands as a reward for his loyalty, and the fervices he 
did his King and country by this adlion, or by what other 
means, I cannot fay. Neither can I fay at what period of 
time this Ruder Derg lived. His name and title, by all 
accounts, was Sir "VVilliam Sutherland of Braygald, that is, 
of the Height of Caithnefs. This eftate has been for many 
years in the pofiefiion of the family of Ulbfter, who acqui- 
red it from the Mackays.

about 8 miles aboye Dirlet. It ftood juft on the bank of

the loch hanging over the firft current of the river out of 
it. In that place the river is very narrow, and very deep 
and withal very current. It is faid, by report, to haTe" 
been built .and inhabited by a perfonage called Morrar, na 
Shean that is, Lord of the Game or Venifon, becaufe he 
delighted in thefe raral fports. It &amp; f aid alfo , th , £ therg 
was a cheftV or feme kind of machine, fixed in the mouth 
of the ftream, below the caftle, for catching falmon in their 
ingrefi into the loch, or their egrefs out of it ; and that, im- 
mediately as the fifo was entangled in the machine, the 
capture was announced to the whole family by the ringing 
of a bell, which the motion and ftruggles of the fifh let a- 
going, by means of a fine cord, that was fixed at one end 
to the bell, in the middle of an upper room, and at the 
other end to the machine in the ftream below. This is by 
no means improbable • for in thefe days, when the falmon 
were more plenty th an they are now, and had a free courfe, 
that ftream and that loch mult have been fwarming with 
that fifh ; and it would be fo ftillj had not our modern in- 
ventions prevented it. 

This Morrar, na Shean, according to report, was very 
anxious and impatient to have a fon to inherit his eftates 
and honours ; but he had only 3 daughters fucceffively, 
at which lie was fo difappointed and enraged, that he mal- 
treated the mother and the daughters ; ^and the mother, 
dreading more and more her hufband's difpleafure and 
ill ufage of herfelf and the infants, detached them pri- 
vately to a place where, without his knowledge, they were 
reared up into very beautiful and accompliflied young la- 
dies, all along amufing the barbarian huiband and parent 
with the laudable pretext that they were dead. Morrar, na 
3 Shean, 



* There is reafon to believe that his name was Cbryne. 



of Halkirk.

Shean, at laft defpairing of having any more children, and 
making a vaft regret that he had no child at all, his lady 
availed herfelf of the favourable opportunity, prefents him 
with his 3 daughters, and thereby converts . his rage and 
difcontentment into a tranfport of joy and furprife. The 
happy fnare difarmed him of his terrors •, the charms of his 
daughters infufed a complacency through his whole frame. 
The interview is a fcene of love, heightened by a happy 
mutual difappointment ; and he thanks God, that his eftates 
would not be under the belt of one man, as he called it. 
They are foon difpofed of in marriage ; the el deft to a Sin- 
clair from the Orkneys, the fecond to a Keith, and the laft 
to one of another name, but of fome rank. 

This ftory is wild and romantic, but it is by no means 
irreconcileable to the favage notions and barbarous ufages 
of thefe dark and fuperftitious times. It may not be alto- 
gether according to the original fact., but is exactly the cur- 
rent tradition of the neighbourhood. It may be too much, 
exaggerated by the embellishments of fancy ; yet, I am 
perfuaded, it is founded on fome event of this nature that 
has taken place in thefe times, otherwife it would not have 
been fo currently and fo facredly tranfmitted from age to 
age by oral tradition. Who this Morrar, na Shean was, I 
cannot find ; but I fufpeft that he was one of the Harolds, 
who had one of his feats at Braal, and retired occasionally 
to his hunting-feat at Lochmore for his amufement ; for 
this reafon he was called by the mock name of Morrar, na 
Shean, i. e. Lord of the Venifon or Game, becaufe he loved 
the one for his table and palate, and the other for his fport 
snd amufement. It cannot be expe&amp;ed that I can afcer- 
tain the era when this wonderful ftory happened, though I 
doubt not, had I accefs to the archives of the old families 
n the country, but I might trace it out, at leaft by way of 

induction. 



^ Statijlical Account 

induction. Suffice it, that it has the appearance of a very 
old ftory, and that it is very probable that thefe marriages 
gave the Sinclairs and the Keiths, who came over here 
more immediately from the Orkneys, the firft footing in 
Caithnefs, where, in a fhort time, they grew fo great and 
powerful ; and to make this ftill the more probable, there 
was a Keith a viceroy, if I recoiled, in the Orkneys, under 
the Danilh monarchy, before any of that name, and per- 
haps of the name of Sinclair, had a footing in this country. 

Next prefents itfelf the awful remains of a very large 
fabric, at a place called Achnavarn, near the loch of Ca- 
thel. It was certainly a building of great ftrength ; and 
feems to have been the habitation of heroes, who delighted 
" in hardy deeds of arms," and who, therefore, were in 
danger, night and day, of being furprifed on all hands by 
enemies of the fame kidney. It was fortified by feveral 
outworks, the remains of which ftrike the beholder with a 
fenfation of terror ; for they bring to his view the violent 
and bloody fcenes that have been there afted, together with 
the dreadful, precarious, and holtile ftate of thefe times. 
By whom or when it was built, or by whom inhabited, I 
cannot find ; but only that current report fays, that it was 
inhabited by a Danifli prince. This is by no means in- 
credible, efpecially when it is confidered, that in thofe days 
this country was perpetually infefted with noble adventu- 
rers from that kingdom, who poffeffed themfelves, by force, 
of the property of the natives, and kept it afterwards by 
the fame holtile and violent means by which they feized 
it, till at length they became as naturalized and fecure as 
the natives themfelves. 

There are other remains of antiquity almoft innumerable. 
Indeed, I know not any parifh that abounds with more. 
What were the particular defign or occafion of them I can-

not precifely fay, neither can I well find. But they {hew, 
in general, that this country was once a theatre of iniquity, 
bloodfhed, and violence ; natives opprefling and plundering 
natives, and foreign rapacious adventurers making a prey 
of them all. There is not one of thefe antiquities that has 
the leaft appearance of being the habitation of peace and 
fecurity. Surely they coft immenfe labour and expence in 
building and defending them, and the people could not be 
weak or few in thofe days. For the manifeft defign of 
them required a great number of hands, and ftrong ones 
too, to accomplifti it ; but how they were fupported and 
maintained, when the moil of their time and labour muft 
have been ingroffed by thefe machinations offenfive and de- 
fenfive, is a myftery which I cannot pretend to folve : for 
in fuch a ftate of affairs, though a great, number of people 
and great expence was neceflarily required for thefe purpo- 
fes, yet very few hands, and very little time and induftry 
could be fpared for the purpofes of life ; and furely, when 
they fought fo well, and fo frequently in thofe days, they 
muft have eat and drank well alfo ; but how or whence 
they got thefe neceflary fupplies is, at this diftance of time, 
hard to account for ; for the people then, as appears by the 
monuments they left behind them, lived more by plunder 
and rapine, than by induftry and cultivating the field. It 
is true, indeed, fiftiing and hunting, and the beafts of pa- 
fture, would furniftx a confiderable fupply, as there was 
better game and fiftiing, and more cattle and pafture than 
are now. It is true alfo, that the foreign adventurers of the 
north would bring fome money and provifions along with 
them. After all, it is ftill a myftery, and fo I leave it. 

Yet fo it is, that the people were then numerous, and. 
very robuft, and well fupported, otherwife they could not 
carry on and atchieve what they did. Their houfes, or

rather faftneffes, feem all of them to have been completely 
circular from bottom to top, prodigiou{ly thick in the walls, 
built with the largeft ftones they could get, without any 
timber at all. Many of them were built on eminences, 
many on plains and low places, according as beft fuited the 
delign, and many furrounded with ditches or ramparts, 
with outpofts or redoubts, in a degree lefs or more. They 
are here called indifcriminately, as is commonly the cafe, 
Pi&amp;ifh Houfes, Druidical Temples, Repofitories of the 
Dead, Cairns, Toulichs. No doubt, they had places and 
houfes for all thefe purpofes, befides their ftrong holds and 
places of ftrength ; yet fecurity and ftrength is the charac- 
teriftic of all their houfes of what kind foever. Thofe of 
them that were on the greateft eminences were evidently 
defigned for watch-towers, whereby any alarm of danger, 
or approach of an enemy, was, quick as lightning, announ- 
ced to the whole country, by the rapid communication of 
light from one watch-tower to another, and all thefe were 
fo ftationed, as molt admirably to accommodate one ano- 
ther, and confequently the whole country, to the remoteft 
corners, as may be feen by any fpe&amp;ator who compares, 
them, their lituations, and diftances to one another. This, 
admirable contrivance was neceffary to a country expofed 
io much- as this was to the frequent invafion of the Danes, 
and the inroads and incurfions of their neighbours. 

With regard to their dwelling houfes, I cannot pafs over 
one or two things I obferved more than- once - T the fame is 
alfo obfervable in what remains of their ftrong towers - r 
thefe were oblong open flits, at certain diftances,. all round 
in the walls -, before each of thefe flits or windows was a 
lodgment, of the dimenfions of a fmall bed. Thefe lodg- 
ments are in the flair, which mounts fpirally through the 
heart of the wall from bottom to top. The defign of this 

is

19 evident. Further, I have feen in them numbers of fmall 
round hard ftones, in the form of a very flat or oblate 
fphere, of *\ inches thick in the centre, and about 4 inches 
in diameter. I have alfo feen other round ftones, perfectly 
circular, very plain and level on one fide, with a fmall rife 
at the circumference, and about a foot in diameter. Now, 
I think the intention of both thefe kinds of ftones is mani- 
feft. It was certainly to break and grind their grain, as 
they had no mills or machines for that purpofe. This they 
did, by breaking the grain on the larger ftone, with the 
fmall round oblate ftone in their hand. 

Befides thefe buildings of ftone, feveral of which were 
prodigious, there are in various parts of the parifti ditches 
or intrenchments no lefs aftoniftiing, edged on the outfide, 
or oppofite parapet, with large mounds of earth and ftone, 
and inclofing a deep hollow in the centre. Thefe were cer- 
tainly encampments, in which they fortified and intrenched 
themfelves in the time of encounter, or when they took 
the field for actual engagement. Pitched battles have 
furely been fought in thefe places; and the remains of 
ftones that have been ere&amp;ed near, and at feveral diftances, 
from thefe intrenchments, were defigned as memorials of 
perfons of note, who have fallen either in clofe battle, or 
in the retreat or purfuit. But what thefe battles were, at 
what time, and by whom they were fought, or who were 
the eminent perfons who fell, and for whom thefe memo- 
rials were erefted, I believe is not to be found. By the 
bye, I have no doubt but fome of thefe ftones would be 
creeled in order to defend a few perfons from the miftlle 
weapons of the enemy, and to give them the advantage of 
difmifling their own miflile weapons at them with the 
greater fuccefs and fecurity, on what fide foever of the ftone 
they made their approach. 

Literary 



6° Statiftical Account 

Literary CharaBer.—l have no account of but one lite- 
rary charader, the Rev. Mr Daniel Campbell, fon to a far- 
mer, commonly called Padric Buy, that is, Yellow Peter, 
who was an Earfe poet, as well as his fon, who compo- 
fed, however, both in Earfe and Englifh. This Daniel 
was, and is ftill called by the old people in this parifli, 
patronimically, Donil Buy, that is, Yellow Donald. He 
was minifter of Kilmichael of Glaflerie in Argylefliire, 
in 1698, as a fragment of one of his books informs me, 
which I have now in my hands. How long he was in 
that parifli before the publication of this book I can- 
not fay. By all accounts he was a man of literature, 
very pious, devout, and fenlible, and withal very gene- 
rous and charitable, very popular, much efteemed, and 
eminently ufeful. He was, in his day, an able member, 
and diftinguiflied character of the church, being alfo an ex- 
cellent orator. This fragment, which is all I have feen of 
hia works, is of a book entitled, Sacramental Meditations 
on the Sufferings and Death of Chrift. A fpirit of rational 
piety and good fenfe breathes through the whole perform- 
ance, and it is reckoned a treafure by all the pious here 
who happen to fall upon it. It was dedicated to the Dut- 
chefs of Argyle. He wrote and publiflied more eflays in 
profe and verfe. Befides, he was a principal hand in tranf- 
lating the Pfalms of David into Irifli verfe, to be fung in 
the church, and fupplied his friends in this country with 
copies of the firft impreffion. He was very generoufly 
mindful of his friends and relations, efpecially in this pa- 
rifli •, for feverals of them being reduced in their circum- 
ftances, by the failure of crops, in confequence of a very 
fevere froft early in harveft, he fent them frequent fupplies 
of money from Argylefliire, particularly, two families in 
Rumfdale, a place in the height of this parifli, whp were en-

tirely fupported by his munificence. In what particular year 
this froft happened I cannot fay ; but it was a memorable 
year, and fatal to many. That it happened in his owa 
and his father's day, appears not only from the circumftance 
above mentioned, but alfo from a paragraph of a letter 
then wrote by the father to the fon :— " All di nues here is, 
" dat di doks got over try on Poul Hacrigg, on di tird of 
" Augt." i. e. " All the news here is, that the dogs got over 
" dry on the Pool of Halkirk." The particular day of the 
week on which it happened was Sunday ; and that it was 
peculiarly fatal to Padric Buy, appears from the following 
poem he made on the occafion : 

Roodh ud'hanic, ar Diadonich, 
Chour, a brone, as moullard orm «

gm of feveral cuttoms, which have prevailed for a W 
time afterwards, and feme of which do Mill prevail is to 
be traced to that period. From this intermixture 'fpring 
many words in their language, efpecially words expreffive 
of the names of perfons, of places, of vefiels, and various 
menuls and inftruments, **4 But a very confiderable 
part of th.s intermixture being Danes and Norwegians, as 
thefe were, by all accounts, fuperior in power and poffef- 
fion, fo their language and ufages would be the moll pre- 
valent alfo ; and among the other effecls of this prevalence, 
-were the names which were given to places, many of which 
are manifeftly of Danim origin. This circumftance, toge- 
ther with the variations they have neceirarily undergone 
in the different ftages of time iince that period, render it 
almoft importable to afcertain, or trace out their real mean- 
ing at this diftance of time. 

At prefent there are two languages fpoken in this parilL, 
the Earfe and the Englifh. The former is much cor- 
rupted, but yet fpoken with great fluency and emphafis, 
and not without harmony of found. The latter has alfo 
many words, which are neither Englifh nor Scotch, yet, ac- 
cording to its idiom, it is fpoken withgreat propriety, and 
the fentiments are expreffed by it, either in narration or 
defcription, as intelligibly and fignificantly, as in any coun- 
ty in Great Britain, nay, I dare fay, more fo than in moll of 
them. Thefe languages are fpoken in various degrees. 
Some fpeak only the Earfe, but do not fpeak or underfland 
the Englifh ; fome underfland the Englifh, but do not 
fpeak it; fome fpeak the Englifh, but do not fpeak or un- 
derftand the Earfe ; fome underfland the Earfe, but do not 
fpeak it ; but the greateft number fpeak and underfland 
both thefe languages equally well. This is their flate with 
regard to language ; but of late years, the Englifh is ma- 
king great progrefs at the expence of the Earfe. 

Farms. 



t 



of Halkirk 



Farms— The farms in this parifh are of great variety 
with refpetf to rent or tack-duty, afcending through vari- 
ous degrees, from L. 2 to L. 200. Thofe of them that fall 
under the defcription of too large tacks or farms, are cer- 
tainly a great bane to induftry and population, and the ne- 
ceffary caufes of many inconveniencies to fubtenants ; and 
it is equally certain, that the advantages arifing from theni 
either to the tackfman or the proprietor, are imaginary and 
' delufive, and terminate in the prejudice of the intereft of 
both. But how happens this ? Why, the tackfman, who is 
not able to labour but a very fmall part of the tack him- 
felf, and founds his credit and fupport on what he can 
make of the fubtenants, this tackfman, in order to keep 
credit with the proprietor, and to fupport" his family, im- 
pofes, and perhaps of neceflity, heavy burdens on the fub- 
tenants, by which they are in the end difabled to keep 
credit with this tackfman. The proprietor, by the rent 
he exafts from the tackfman, will reduce him in the end 
to bankruptcy, if he has no other fhift; and if he fho'uld 
have fuch fhifts, it is odds but he muft pay for thefe alfo, 
as foon as they are perceived. Thus, the great evil origi- 
nates with the proprietor, though perhaps undefignedly- 
Yet I will not {land forth in the vindication of thefe large 
tackfmen. They themfelves are much to blame, either by 
taking tacks, which oblige them to diftrefs others and 
themfelves ; or, if they hold their tacks on reafonable 
terms, by opprefTuig their fubtenants, not from motives of 
neceflity, but from motives of gain, and to make them - 
felves eafy at their expence. 

And, as too large farms are great evils, for the reafous 
above ftated, fo, on the other hand, too fmall ones are no 
lefs fo, for other reafons no lefs important. They are too 
inadequate to the burden they have to fupport. even when 

they 



6 4 



Statijlical Account 



they are held on reafonable terms ; but how much more fo 
when the cafe is often otherwife. What is this burden ? 
Why, thefe tacks fubject their poffeffors to feveral fervi- 
tudes, which ought neceffarily to be beftowed on their fa- 
milies and farms ; to expences in labouring, too difpropor- 
tionate to the profits they can exped. They have rents to 
pay, a family and fervants to fupport, a horfe, an ox, and 
cow to buy, any of which may be more than the rent ; 
and oftentimes their fmall crops are very much curtailed 
by the rapacious hand of the miller, who has every power 
and opportunity in his hands to treat them without mercy. 
Now, thefe are things which too fmall a farm cannot bear, 
even though the tenant held it otherwife on reafonable 
terms. They are, at beft, but a deceitful kind of wretched- 
nefs, amufing them with gilded and fallacious hopes, which 
reconcile them to their prefent ftate, but feduce them into 
complete ruin at laft. The meaneft fervant of fuch a te- 
nant reaps much more from his tack than he does himfelf. 

Another great evil arifing from thefe too fmall farms 
is, that they are a ftrong temptation to tradefmen to take 
them, whenever they have made a few pence by their 
trade, in which they were profperous before they became 
tenants ; now, being entrapped into a farm, their families 
and their trade rum into ruin at once. By this means a 
good and ufeful tradefman is loft to the public, or rather 
becomes a burden to it. 

There is, further, another evil accompanying thefe too 
fmall tacks ; they entice many from the fervice to become 
tenants, who could have lived more comfortably and ufe- 
fully in their former ftate. This is one great reafon why 
fervants are fo dear, and fo difficult to be got by the far- 
mer, or if he gets them, that they are fo uninterefted and 
carelefij in his fervice. From the moment they engage in 



* the 



of Halkirk. H 

the fervice, the only objeft that occupies their attention is 
to gather a few pence, to enable them to marry, and take 
one of thefe fmall farms. Thus they are impatient of the fer- 
vice, and make it only a job of very fecondary confidera- 
tion while they are in it. Hence it is, that they leave the fer- 
vice without any great flock or charader, and reduce them- 
felves to mifery at laft ; whereas, if they had not the temp- 
tation of thefe fmall tacks before them, neceffity and felf- 
« intereft would compel them to make a charafter in the fer- 
vice, becaufe, in this cafe, their future prcfpeds would en- 
tirely depend upon it, having no immediate profpeft of 
being able to take a farm, which would require a great- 
er (lock than fervants ufually can afford. Thus, the pa- 
rim would be better accommodated in fervants j and the 
fervants, on the other hand, would live more comfortably. 
This is by no means meant to limit or circumfcribe the 
chances of fervants. No ; on the contrary, it is their true 
intereft and welfare I aim at. 

There is yet another grievance occurs to me, and of 
which thefe too fmall tacks are the occalion. The conti- 
nual neceflities of their poffefTors put them on fhiftsfor pre- 
fent relief, which come upon them with vengeance at laft. 
They fpend a great part of fummer and harveft in carry- 
ing peats and heather to Thurfo, which would have been 
more ufefully and profitably beftowed on the neceffary 
purpofes of the farm. Had this time and labour they fub- 
tra£t from the farm been in any tolerable degree compen- 
fated by their profits in this bufinefs of carriage, there 
would be lefs to fay. But- this is not the cafe ; for the va- 
lue they get for their time and labour is very inconfider- 
able •, and what makes it more fo. is, that a great part, if 
not the whole of it, is fpent ufelefsly before they return ; 
and their horfes, which are a great part of their ftock, are 
both jaded and .ftarved. Had they been near the town, 

Vol. XIX. I and

and provided in carts, it would have made this bufinefc 
more tolerable and profitable ; but, on the contrary, they 
carry them the diftance of 9 or 10 miles, and in bad roads, 
and on their horfes backs ; and fix horfes will not carry 
what one cart would hold, and one horfe would carry in. 
that cart with eafe ; mere neceffity is the caufe of this 
r/retched bufinefs. 

From the fame caufe it is alfo, that numbers of thefe 
fmall tenants fell, early of the year, ancf at a low price, 
the victual that fliould go to fupport their families, and pay 
the matter. By this means, in order to filence the clamo- 
rous dun of their creditors, who, no ooubt, may avail them- 
felves of their neceffity, little remains for the rent and the 
family ; and if it mould fo happen that they pay the rent, 
yet they are, at the long run, reduced to the neceffity of 
buying victual at a dearer rate than they fold ; and if they 
have no money or credit, as for the moft part they have 
not, the mafter mull interpofe with his purfe or his victual, 
or they muft ftarve. Very often they make whilky of 
their beer, with a pretence to make money for the rent. 
By this bufinefs, whatever profit the diftiller may have, I 
am fure they can have none, but rather lofs, confidering 
the time fpent, the duty paid, the whilky drunk, the pot 
hire, as they call it, and the want of the draff and burnt 
ale, which go to the diftiller. Now, from what I have 
faid about farms, it is not to be underftood that I allude to 
the pofitive dearnefs of tacks. No ; I all along alude to 
their relative dearnels, or as they Hand with refpect to the 
prefent ftate of things in the parifh. 

Services. — I have mentioned fervices more than once as 
a grievance. They are fo, and ought to be aboliflied, if 
for no other reafon, yet for this great one, i/tz. that the te- 
nant might have all his time and labour for the purpofc s 

of 



of Halkirk, 67 



of "his farm and credit. Thefe will neceffarily require the 
whole of his induftry and time, though none of them were 
bellowed to ferve the purpofes of the landlord. Here it 
may be faid, that thefe fervices are abundantly eompen- 
fated by the eafy terms on which they hold their tacks. 
This is mere delufion ; for fcarcely will any confideration 
of this kind, were it true, compenfate the neglect of their 
own neceffary affairs at home. Befides, on the fuppo- 
fition that they have value in their tacks for thefe fervices, 
yet, being always in pinching circumftances, it is with the 
greateft reluctance they perform them. Becaufe they are 
not animated with a prefent meal for their hungry paunch, 
and with the profpedt of payment at night to carry it home 
to a craving family, they confider the whole as loft time 
and labour ; therefore they perform the fervice but very 
heavily and indifferently, and are well pleafed how little the 
work is if the night is come. This being the cafe, what 
they do is far fliort of the work of a day-labourer, who ex- 
pects his hire at night to refrefh and enliven himfelf and 
family on his return. Thus the mafter's work goes on but 
flowly and llightly, and their own work at home ne- 
glected. 

Mills— Mills are, in fome parts at leaft of the parifb, a 
very great and lhameful grievance. The proprietor, for 
an advance of rent, is tempted to give a leafe of the farm 
-and mill upon it, without any reftriaions. The tackfman, 
thinking he pays too dear, falls on fhifts to make reprifals. 
He fubfets the mill to under millers, at a rate which they 
are not able to anfwer. The millers, that they may keep 
credit, of neceffity opprefs the fuckeners. The fucken- 
ers complain to the laird, or his factor. They get no 
hearing or redrefs. They return home, lamenting their 
fate. The millers redouble their oppreffion. The fucken- 
1 

ers 



68 Statijlical Account 



ers go in humble proftration before the matter miller, and 
prefent their petition to his majefty. His intereft is too 
much concerned ; he knows the millers cannot pay him, 
unlefs they are very fevere j he turns his back, bids the di- 
ftreffed fuppliants good day ; he has nothing to do with 
the mill ; it is fubfet ; let them agree with the millers, 
Thus they all fin by proxy, and the poor fuckener is the 
facrifice. Thus the proprietor and tenant pay dearly for 
this additional rent, for more reafons than one, which are 
too obvious to be mentioned. However, it is not amifs to 
produce an inflance. There is a tack in my neighbour- 
hood, the rent of which is L. 46. It is as much a grafs as 
a corn tack. This tapk pays the mill, according to the 
prefent price of victual, L. 8, 10 s. which is very near 1- 
5th of the rent ; and yet the miller is not fatisfied. Not 
many years ago, the multure, i$c. paid out of this farm 
was not near one half of what it is now, neither was the 
produce of it lefs, however more. 

Conclufiofi— Now all thefe evils, and many more, might 
be removed, and many great advantages introduced, if the 
prefent ftate of things were modified, or in fome meafure 
altered. This, I think, might be eafily effected; and the 
parilh is a moft excellent fubje6t for it. I need not 
point out the means whereby this defirable end would 
moft likely be brought about. They are obvious to 
common obfervation. If the heritors had attended more 
to their own true intereft, and confidered that of their 
tenants as their own, for they are infeparable; if they 
had done this, it would naturally and. neceflarily lead 
£hem into this meliorating plan ; but the difficulty is to 
perfuade them that the adoption of fuch a plan would be 
their intereft. The temptation of prefent gain makes 
them blind to what would enlarge their future profpefts, 



of Halkirk. % 

and be forthcoming with double intereft to their advan- 
taw. Bnt what is this plan ? Let them dnly confider the 
prefent Hate of things, and it will fuggeft theplan to them. 
The malady will point out the remedy, if they chafe to 
embrace and apply it.- Without entering deep into this 
affair, which I leave to themfelves and more able hands, 
I would beg leave to fuggeft to them in general the ne- 
ceflity and great advantage of exciting' a fpirit of induftry, 
frugality, and emulation among their tenants, by due en- 
couragement and good example, of putting their traffick 
and commerce into a better channel; of introducing into 
the parilh Tome branches of trade and manufacture, of 
which it is capable; of animating them with the com- 
fortable profped of enjoying the fruit of their labours; 
and finally, and above all, of cherifhing and cultivating- 
their principles, both moral and religious. This would, 
in a ftiort time, bring about better crops, and a greater 
variety of them ; more particularly, it would introduce 
the railing of flax, for which this parifli is well calculated. 
It would further enlarge their commerce and credit, 
would furnifh a more ready market, which they often 
want ; and turn the balance of trade, which at prefent 
is againft them in feveral articles, to be in their favour. 
Finally, it would make cultivation lefs expenfive, andj 
more effectual, efpecially in the articles of fervants and 
labouring cattle, which are juft now a burden ; for near 
one half of both would ferve all the purpofes of the 
farmer, if they were of a better kind, and properly-guided.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q623687">FALKIRK</name>, 



(County of Stirling, Synod of Lothian and Tweed- 
dale, Presbytery of Linlithgow), 



By James Wilson, M. A. Minijler of the Parifh.</head> 



<p>Boundaries, and general Defcription. 

THE parifh of Falkirk is between 7 and 8 miles in 
length from E. to W. and in fome parts more than 
4 miles in breadth. It is bounded on the E. by the frith 
of Forth and the parifh of Polmont; on the S. by the pa- 
xifhes of Polmont and Slamannan ; on the W. by Cumber- 
nauld and Denny ; and on the N. by the river Carron, 
which feparates it from the united parifhes of Larbert and 
Dunipace. By the changes which die courfe of this river 
has undergone, a few houfes belonging to this parifh are 
now on the Larbert fide \ and a few, which are connected 
With that parifh. aire on the Falkirk fide of the river. 

From 



Statijlical Account 



F rom a reference to the parifh of Falkirk, in an action 
with refpeft to the patronage of the church and parifli of 
Oldhamftocks, in the prelbytery of Dunbar, which was 
depending in the year 1748 between the King and Mr 
Hay of Lawfield, it appears that the pariflies of Denny, 
Slamannan, Muiravonfide, and Polmont, conftituted for- 
merly parts of the parfonage of Falkirk. The three fir ft 
of thefe pariflies muft have been very early feparated from 
Falkirk; but it was not till the year 1724 that Polmont 
was formed into a parifli. The minifter of Polmont has 
» not only ftipend from his own parifli, but alfo from thofe 

of Falkirk and Denny. 

The eftate of Callander having been confifcated imme- 
diately after the commotion in the year 1715, it was fold 
about the year 1720 ; and fuch tithes as were not conveyed 
with the eftate, were difpofed of by the commiflioners and 
truftees of the forfeited eftates in Scotland to Mr Hamilton 
of Dichmond, under this exprefs ftipulation, that they fliould 
be fubjecl to the ftipend of a minifter for the new parifli, 
which was to be taken off the parifli of Falkirk. This cir- 
cumftance explains by what means it happened that ftipend 
is paid both out of this parifli and Denny to the minifter of 
Polmont. 

Falkirk is fituated on the north road between Edinburgh 
and Glafgow, and it is nearly at an equal diftance from 
both. The road to Stirling and the North Highlands alfo 
pafies through this town. Falkirk was once denominated 
Ecclejbrae, that is, the Church on the Brow ; and the name 
is truly defcriptive of the fituation, for the town ftands on 
an eminence, which has a declivity on every fide. In the 
Gaelic language it is called an Eglais bhris, but more com- 
monly an Eglais bhrec. The former of thefe phrafes fig- 
'^nifies the Broken Church, which fome think is not impro- 
perly tranflated Falkirk, that is, the Fallen Church. Cer- 
tain 



of Falkirk, 73 

tain it is, that the church of Falkirk, as it now ftands, has 
not all been built at the fame time. In the year 1166, it 
was given * to the monaftery of Holyroodhoufe by the 
Bifhop of St Andrew's ; and as the parifhes belonging to 
thefe religious foundations were often not properly attend- 
ed to with refpedl: to religious inftrucHon and accommoda- 
tion, fo it is not improbable that the church of this parifh 
might have been permitted to fall into ruin, and thence the 
name under confideration might have taken its rife. 

Eglais bbrec, the latter of the Gaelic defignations 
which I mentioned, fignifies the Spotted Church. To this 
name Buchanan, who underftood the Gaelic language, gives 
his fupport, for in his Hiftory of Scotland he calls Falkirk, 
" Varium Sacellum." It is fuppofed by fome, that it got 
that defignation from the party-coloured appearance of the 
ftones in the building. 

As the wall of Antoninus, which will afterwards be de- 
fcribed, paffed very near the churchy and where a part of 
the town is built, fome are of opinion, that the prefent 
name of this place is derived from Vallum and Kirk which 
by an eafy tranfition, became Falkirk, thereby fignifying 
the Church upon the Wall. 

The greater part of this parifh is inclofed and fubdivided, 
as well as enriched by trees, villas, and gentlemens feats. 
The numerous fine trees which are in Callander park and 
its neighbourhood, together with the wood belonging to 
the fame place, add much to the pleafantnefs of the town 
of Falkirk ; as it is fituated in the immediate vicinity of 
thefe rural and enlivening objefts. From the manfe, and 
other places on the north fide of the town, the profpeft is 
delightful, and comprehends a fertile and well-cultivated 
country of 12 or 14 miles fquare, which is bounded by the

Ochil-hills and elevated fixations in the counties of Stir- 
ling, Fife, and Linlithgow. Toward the N. W. the tops 
of fome of the Highland hills are to be feen, involved in 
clouds, and at certain feafons of the year covered with 
fnow, when none of it is to be feen elfewhere within the 
whole compafs of our profpda. A part of the frith of 
Forth, prefenting itfelf to view, and the velfels, paffing on 
the canal, within a mile of Falkirk, enhance confiderably 
the beauty of the fcene. 

When this profpea is involved in the darknefs of night, 
the flalhes of light from the iron-works at Carron, appear 
in awful and fublime majefty. When a fall of rain or 
fnow is foon to happen, the light is refrafted by the thick 
and moift atmofphere, and corifidefable illuminations ap* 
pear in the air above the works. Thefe are feen at a con- 
fiderable diftance, and great flames of light are thrown into 
the houfes in this neighbourhood, which have windows to- 
ward the Carron works. Upon the eminence on the S. 
of Falkirk, the profpe&amp; not only comprehends the whole 
view which I have defcribed, but alfo the fcenery about 
Callander houfe, to which I have already alluded ; the vef- 
fels in the harbour of Grangemouth ; the marts of thofe in 
that of Borrowftounnefs ; the ruins of the palace of Lin- 
lithgow; the fteeples of that town, and thofe of Dun-

are 3892 ; in the village of Camelon there are 568 5 in that

parifh the inhabitants are about 1534 in number * Among 
a people fo numerous, we mud expect to fiftd different fen- 
timents refpefling religion, as well as about every other 
fubjea which comes under their confideration J but it is no 
fmall conization to fee, that the bitterncfs of ill-dirtded 
zeal is fall giving way to charity, and the natural influence 
of progreffive improvements. Nothing will fland the teft 
of time and experience, but that which is founded on truth. 
Error and prejudice will pafs away, and it behoves us to 
rejoice, that amongft the wreck of falfe or unimportant 
fpeculations, virtue, will remain without a blemifti, and 
completely fecure. It is the effence of true religion ; it is 
the point where men of worth meet ; and it is the centre 
from which every ray of excellence proceeds. The jarrings 
of intereft may, on occafions, difturb the calmnefs of hu- 
man life ; but if reafon direct the thoughts, and condud 
the adtions, the effects on the whole muft be harmony and 
peace. • 

In the town of Falkirk, there is one chapel for the 
Burghers, two for the Antiburghers f , and one belonging 
to the Relief intereft. In Laurieftown, there is a chapel 
for the moft ancient Prefbyterian Diflenters in Scotland, 
who are generally known by the name of Macmillanites.

1784 to January 1794, is 272. The annual number of marriages taken in 
the fame manner, for the fame term of years, is 62. But it appears, that 
the population of the parifh is increafing, for the average of marriages 
for the lad eight years is "]%.

Antiburghers in this town, which aroie chiefly from the manner of fetting

compofed of people from this and other parifbes. I„ fcfe 
panfh there are a few of the Epifcopal perfuafion, who 
have an opportunity of attending divine fervice every fort-

number here, and have no place of worfhip in the neigh- 
bourhood. °

a J V hlS Parlftl f ° r ' th0fe Wh ° belon S t0 the religious 
eftabhfhment of Scotland. The building is i a the form 

of a crofs, and far from being, fufficient for the accommoda-

will foon be done to provide a remedy for this inconve- 



nience. 



Before the Reformation, the pariih of Falkirk belonged 
to the fee of St Andrew's. Immediately after that period, 
and before the Prefbyterian mode of worfhip had aflumed 
its prefent form, there were fuperintendents appointed for 
the different diftrids of the country. Falkirk was within 
the bounds of Mr Spottifwood's infpeftion, who was parfon 
of Calder-Comitis*. and father of Spottifwood, who fuc- 
ceeded the fuperintendent in the parfonage of Calder, was 
Archbifhop of Glafgow after Epifcopacy was re-eftablifhed 
in Scotland, wrote a hiftory of the Church, and, after en- 
joying many honours, died Archbifhop of St Andrew's. 

While he prefided over this- fee, that part of the diocefe 
which was fituated on the fouth fide of the frith of Forth 
was ere&amp;ed into a bifhoprick, and called the fee of Edin- 
burgh. St Giles's was the cathedral, and the minifter of 
Falkirk was one of the twelve prebends. His falary for 
this office was L. 80 Scotch, which is L. 6 : 13 : 4 Sterling. 
A perfon of the name of Forbes was the firfl; Bifhop of

this diocefe. He is reprefented as having been a man of 
learning and piety, but rather fufpe&amp;ed of being a friend 
to Popery. His ftudies were chiefly directed toward anti- 
quities ; and being reclufe in his manners, he was little ac- 
quainted with the world. It is faid that it was no uncom. 
mon thing for him to preach five or fix hours at a time *. 

After the benefice of Falkirk was beftowed upon the 
monaftery of Holyroodhoufe, the living of this parilli be- 
came a vicarage. The great tithes, which formerly be- 
longed to the parfon, were then claimed by the religious 
order to which they had been given, and the minifter of 
the parifli was paid with the fmall ; and the parfon of Fal- 
kirk ftill receives fome fmall fums of money as vicarage- 
dues. The ftipend of this parifli confifts at prefent of 32 
bolls of barley, 64 of oat-meal, and about L. 65 : 14 : 2^ 
of money, together with a manfe, garden and glebe. The 
minifter of Falkirk alfo claims a right of getting from the 
eftate of Callander all the coals which are made ufe of by 
his family, without any other expence than that of paying 
for cutting them from the ftratum in the pit, and bringing 
them home. Among feveral donations which King Da- 
vid I. made to the monaftery of Newbottle, was that of 
fuel and pafture for cattle in the wood of Callander + , and 
it was upon this grant, I prefume, that the privilege under 
eonfideration was founded. 

The King is patron of this church, and has the right of 
presenting minifters to all the pariflies of which the Earl 
of Linlithgow and Callander was patron before he was at- 
tainted of high treafon. The patronage of the church of 
Denny appears, by the deed of conveyance, to have been

fold along with the barony of Herbertfhire in the year 
1632. This tranfaftion was fanclioned by charters of con- 
firmation from the King in the years 1654 and 1680. 
However the King, as well as Mr Muirhead, claims the 
right of prefenting, and the matter has not yet been brought 
to a final decifion. 

Schools — The grammar-fchool of Falkirk is juftly held 
in great reputation. Befides the fchool-wages, the mafter 
enjoys a falary and confiderable emoluments as feflion- 
clerk. We have here a fchool for Englilh, to which there 
is alfo a falary annexed, the mafter whereof has no fmall 
degree of merit in the line of his profeffion. There are other 
fchools in Falkirk which do honour to their mafters; and, 
upon the whole, our youths have good opportunities of 
laying the foundation of future ufefulnefs and importance. 

In the village of Camelon there is a dwelling-houfe and 
fchool-room provided for the encouragement of a fchool- 
mafter, but no falary. Lord Dundas of Alke gives to a 
fchoolmafter in Grangemouth a houfe to dwell in, a fchool- 
room, and L. 5 a-year. In Lauriefton he gives a dwelling- 
houfe and fchool-room, but not any falary. One of the 
name of Scott, fome years ago, left a fmall fum of money 
for the encouragement of a fchool at Bonny-bridge, which 
is toward the weft end of this parifh. 

Though populous and flourifhing fituations like Falkirk 
yield a decent competence for the fupport of refpe&amp;able 
fchoolmafters, yet in few fituations are they paid in propor- 
tion to their ufefulnefs in fociety. 

Country fchools, where the inhabitants are neither rich 
nor numerous, require at this time peculiar attention. Pa- 
rilh fchools in general ought to have their falaries increa- 
fed, as every thing neceffary for the comfort and fupport 
of life is riling in value, ■ except money, which muft of

courfe fall in proportion. Parifh fchools have been the great 
nurferies of that general knowledge which is fo commonly 
to be found even among the peafants of Scotland ; and from 
them fome of our moft illuftrious charafters have fprung forth. 
But I am afraid, if additional encouragement be not foon 
given, that thofe fources of improvement and wifdom muft 
foon be abandoned to the direction of the illiterate. Men 
of learning and ability will not chufe to languifli in obfcu- 
rity and indigence, but will feek for employment in fome 
of the more lucrative fituations of civil life ; and then the 
nation will be prevented from being adorned and improved 
by thofe luminaries, which opportunities of education 
would have formed and drawn out to public view. 

Poor. — The number of perfons in this parifh who are at 
one time upon the poors roll, may be eftimated at an ave- 
rage at fomewhat more than 15©. They are fupplied with 
fmall fums of money, according to their circumftances, 
from 1 s. to 5 s. or 6 s. a-month. The money which is. 
thus expended on the indigent of this parifh arifes from 
funds belonging to the poor, from offerings at the church- 
gates on days of divine fervice, from other voluntary con- 
tributions, and from an affeffment which the landholders 
annually lay upon themfelves of L. 1 Sterling for every 
L. loo Scotch of valued rent in the parifh. As many 
perfons, from the nature of their property, are little or in 
no degree expofed to the afieflment, there is an annual, 
voluntary and liberal fubfcription in the town of Falkirk, 
and in the villages of the parifh. 

There is alfo in the town of Falkirk an hofpital for the 
fupport of four aged and infirm perfons. It was founded 
and endowed in 1640 by Lord Livingfton of Almond and 
Callander. This deed was amplified and confirmed by him 
in the year 1668, after he was created Earl of Callander. 

Upon 



8o Statiftical Account 

Upon certain parts of the eftates which then belonged to his 
Lordflup, there is fecurity given for the fulfilment of the 
obligation. Moreover, if his Lordlhip, or any of the fuc- 
ceffors to his eftates, mould negled or refufe to fill up any 
vacancy in this hofpital, it is provided by the forefaid aft 
that, if this neglecl or refufal be perfifted in, after notice 
ihall have been given ia due form to the perfon or perfons 
then poffefling the Callander eftates, then' the minifter of 
Falkirk for the time being is authorifed to prefent a proper 
objea of this charity to fill any vacancy which mall be in 
the circumftances now defcribed. Mr Richard Callander, 
then minifter of Falkirk, and his fucceffors in that office, 
were, in the above fpecified deed, made, conftituted and ap- 
pointed patrons of this hofpital, and were lawfully autho- 
red to nominate and admit proper poor perfons to the 
benefit thereof in all cafes where the faid Earl or his fuc- 
ceffors mould refufe or illegally delay to do their duty. 

There are feveral focieties in this town and neighbour- 
hood for the fupport of the members thereof, when they 
are feized by ficknefs, infirmity or old age ; but it is much 
to be lamented, that inftitutions of this kind are not more 
common and extenfive. When the labourer is in health, 
he finds fufficient demands for his money, and too feldom 
thinks of making a little retrenchment in his expences, in 
order that he may prepare for the evil day. The Legifla- 
ture have turned their attention to thofe ufeful and impor- 
tant focieties, but much ftill remains to be done, in order 
to infure their extenfion and fuccefs. 

Agriculture, and rural Improvements, — The land im- 
mediately about the town of Falkirk is let in fmall pieces, 
and produces a rent of L. 2, 10 s. to L. 3, 5 s. p e r acre, 
Scotch meafure *. The Carfe farms, upon an average, 

may 

* The Scotch acre contains 54,760 {"(pare feet, and the ftatute acie

of Falkirk. 9i 

iriay be ftated at L. 1 an acre ; more or lefs, according to 
circumftances. Good land, which is not of Carfe quality, 
is alfo let at a very high rent ; but in feme parts of the 
parifh, where the foil is poor, wet, and fpungy, the value 
of the acre is very fmall.' 

In the Carfe, the crops of grain and hay are fo luxuriant 
and productive, that the farmers have but a fmall portion 
of their land in pafture ; and of courfe they have no more 
cattle than are neceffavy for the family and the farm. 

The rotation of farming in the Carfe of Falkirk confifts 
in general of fix parts : Firft, the ground is fallowed ; fe- 
condly, it is fown with wheat ; thirdly, with beans and 
peafe ; fourthly, with barley ; fifthly, it produces a crop 
of grafs for hay, the feeds of which had been fown the pre- 
ceding year with the barley ; and fixthly, it is fown with 
oats. 

The valued rent of the parifh, by which the land-tax, 
parifh affeflments, &amp;c. are paid, is L. 13,521': 8 : 6 Scotch 
money *. The rental of the parifli, about fourteen years 
ago, was eftimated at L. 6,277, 9 s. Sterling ; but owing to 
the improvements which have taken place lince that pe- 
riod, the rental cannot now be lefs than L. 9000. Houfe- 
rents are not taken into the account in either of the above 
valuations. , 

Soon after the eftates of the family of Linlithgow and 
Callander were forfeited, they were purchafed by the 
Company which undertook to raife water from the river 
Thames into the York-buildings, for fupplying a part of 
the city of London. The affairs of that Company having 
foon after gone into diforder, their whole eftates were fold 
for the benefit of their creditors by the authority of the 
Court of Seffion ; and thofe of Callander and Almond

were bought by William Forbes, Efq; the prefent proprie- 
tor. 

The whole eftates, together with fome other farms 
which were purchafed by him about the fame time, a- 
mounted to about 8o»o Scotch acres; almoft 7000 of 
thefe, are in this parilh. Excepting about 500 acres, it 
was all arable ; but little more than 200 of it were inclo- 
fed. The whole farms were out of leafe, and the tenants 
were all removed as foon as they could provide themfelves 
with other lituations, in order that there might be no ob- 
ftru&amp;ion to the intended improvements. 

Almoft the whole of thefe eftates is now inclofed and 
fubdivided. The fences are, as much as poffible, drawn at 
right-angles to one another ; the ridges are ftraightened ; 
and the wet parts are drained, or in the train of being 
done with all convenient fpeed. The inclofures which are 
near the town of Falkirk or the villages adjoining, contain 
each from three to four Scotch' acres of land ; but thofe 
which are in different lituations, comprehend from feven to 
eight acres of the fame meafure. 

About 2000 acres, which are near the canal and in the 
vicinity of Falkirk, were limed upon the green fward, and 
let to tenants for the fpace of two years, who were bound 
to lay them down with grafs-feeds in the laft year of their 
leafe. A confiderable part of the land, which was over- 
run by heath, broom and furze, was let to tenants alfo, who 
were to plough it five times. This in like manner was to 
be laid down for grafs ; but in both cafes the grafs-feeds 
were to be provided by the proprietor, and at his cxpence. 

Thefe improvements will not only add much to the 
beauty of a diftricl already delightful ; but when comple- 
ted, will add much to the richnefs of this neighbourhood. 
Jt is one diftinguiftiing feature in the improvements of Mr 
Forbes, that they are intended to be completed before he

let the land in long leafes ; whereas it is common to carry 
on improvements after the farms are in the poffeffion of te- 



nants. 



Of Servants Wages, Prices of Food, Wc.—A good plough- 
man gets about L. 12 a-year, together with his bed and 
board ; and a common female fervant expefts from L. 3, 
10 s. to L. 4 per annum., independent of food and lodging. 
A man who engages to labour by the day, has is. ad. in 
fummer, and 1 s. in winter. During harveft the wages are 
higher. Great quantities of grain, efpecially barley, beans, 
and peafe, are fold in this market. Carfe barley is held in 
fuch high eftimation,that it brings, in general, two or three 
{billings per boll more than barley from other parts of the 
country. During thefe feveral months, the price of grain 
has been extravagant; barley has been fold at L. 1 : 12 s. 
per boll, wheat at L. a : ia :'6, and oat-meal at is. 4 d. 
a-peck. It is worthy of obfervation, that in former 
times of fcarcity, the people of Scotland looked up to 
England, as well as to foreign countries, for fupply ; 
but in the prefent feafon, when the people of England are 
in want, we have not only plenty within our ^borders, but 
have been enabled to relieve them in their neceflity. 



Markets, ^f.— Belides feveral fairs in the year, and 
three tryfts *, there is a market every week on Thurfday. 
At thefe three tryfts there are, at an average, 60,000 black 
cattle. As moft of them are of the fmall Highland breed, 
the medium" price may be fixed at L. 4 each. Thus at 
thefe meetings, it is fuppofed, L. 400,000 Sterling are put 
into circulation. Not a fmall proportion of this money 
pafies through the Falkirk Bank. There are alfo horfes 
and flieep difpofed of at thefe markets. 

By

Our markets are well fupplied with butcher-meat of ex- 
cellent quality. It is fold by the Scotch Trone weight ; 
the pound of which, as it is ufed here, is to that of the A- 
voirdupois, as 7,000 are to 10,450. 

Forty years ago, not more than one heifer, cow, or bul- 
lock, together with a few flieep and lambs, were expofed 
to fale in the weekly market of Falkirk. As to veal, it 
?vas fcarcely to be found, but in the fpring. But I am au- 

thorifed

thorlfed to fay, that there have not been fold in the Gam- 
bles of this town, during the courfe of the laft year, fewer 
than 2000 black cattle, 6boo fheep and lambs, and calves 
in proportion. 

Fort j years ago, few of the common people were in the 
habit of eating butcher-meat, except a little with their 
greens m winter. This fcanty portion they felted about 
Martinmas, and confequently, about that feafon of the year, 
more butcher-meat than common was brought into the 
market. But now all defections of the people are more 
in the praaice of eating animal food. 

It appears from Dalrymple's Annals of Scotland, that 
the price of a hen in 1295 was only one penny ; but now 
one that is well fed will coil fifteen or eighteen pence. 

Forty years ago, the price of butcher meat in this mar- 
ket was only about 2 d. per pound ; but now it is from 4 d. 
to 6d. or 7 d. 

Forty years ago there were but 3 furgeons in the town 
of Falkirk ; but at prefent there is 1 phyfician, 5 furgeons, 
and 2 druggifts. 

About 60 years ago this town and neighbourhood were 
chiefly fupplied with wheaten bread from Edinburgh and 
Linlithgow. There were then only 3 bakers in Falkirk, 
and they were but occafionally employed. Hence it is, 
that the people in the remote parts of the country, when 
they come to procure bread for feafts or funerals, do flill 
enquire of the bakers if their ovens be heated. 

There are now 18 bakers in the town of Falkirk, and 6 
in the different villages within the parifh. They make ex- 
cellent bread, and the price is regulated by the Edinburgh 
affize. 

At the period above alluded to there were not more 
than 200 bolls of wheat per annum reduced into flour for 
the ufe of the Falkirk bakers. It was ground in common 

mills, 



of Falkirk.

mills, and boulted by hand-fieves. Now, about 7000 bolls 
are made ufe of annually ; it is ground in mills, which are 
made for the purpofe of preparing flour ; it is boulted, and 
the different kinds feparated by machinery, which is con- 
ftrudted according to the lateft improvements. Seven of 
thefe mills are within a few miles of the town. 

Forty years ago there were but 2 grocers in Falkirk ; 
they complained of little bufinefs, and one of them was 
alfo a tallow-chandler. They had all their grocery goods 
from Borrowftounnefs, and imported nothing themfelves. 
We have now 22 in that line of bufinefs ; fome of them 
carry on an extenfive trade, both in wholefale and retail, 
and import wine, i$c. from foreign parts. 

It appears, that in the reign of Charlemagne, there was 
but one clock in Europe, and it was fent to him by Ab- 
dalla King of fPerfia *. How different is the fituation of 
arts and improvements now, when there are four clock and 
watchmakers in the town of Falkirk itfelf ! 

There are two lodges of free-mafons in Falkirk. One 
of them is fo ancient, that it is marked No. 18. in the 
books of the Grand Lodge. The lodge of Carron alfo 
meets in a houfe within the precin&amp;s of this parifh. 

Falkirk was formerly a burgh of regality, and I have 
now before me a burgefs-ticket, ligned by one of the Earls 
of Linlithgow and Callander. I find no veftiges of any 
magiftrates which have been inverted with the powers of 
the burgh, except the bailiff of barony, who, in former 
times, before the hereditary jurifdictions were taken away, 
had an extenfive jurifdiclion both in criminal and civil 
cafes. We have ftill a baron-bailie, who is nominated 
by the lord of the manor. But the power of life and death 
is not now attached to any barony. He can, within the 
bounds of his jurifdiclion, enforce the payment of rents to 

any

any amount, and decide in difputes about money affair, 
prov lded the fum do not exceed L. a Sterling' The 
debtors goods may be diftrained for payment, and, if not 
iufhcient, he may be imprifoned for one month. He can, 
or fmall oftences, fine to the amount of 20 s. and put de- 
linquents into the flocks in the day-time for the fpace of 
three hours. 

We ftand much in need of a police-bill for regulating the 
aiairs of the town, and making thofe improvements which 
the ftate of its mcreafed population requires. Much to the 
honour of the' people, it may be mentioned, that though 
there is no place of confinement in the county nearer than 
Stirling, which is eleven miles diftant, yet there are few 
mftances of riot or diforder. It has been obferved, that a 
confiderable part of the buftnefs which comes before the 
Court at the Stirlingihire affizes, Uc. proceeds from this 
quarter of the diftruSt ; but it ought alfo to be attended to, 
that the population of Falkirk, and three or four miles 
round it, bears a great proportion to that of the whole 
county. 

A confiderable rjart of thofe aflonifhing improvements, 
which, within thefe 40 years, have been made in this pa- 
nlh, and in the adjoining country, has been owing to the 
great canal, which is cut from the frith of Forth to the ri- 
ver Clyde. As Scotland is almoft cut into two parts by 
the frith and river, which have juft been mentioned, an 
idea was formed as early as the reign of Charles II. of open- 
ing a communication between the eaft and weft Teas through 
the medium of a canal. In 1723, a furvey of the intended 
track was taken by Mr Gordon, who is well known *s the 
author of the " Itinerarium Septentrionale." In the 
year 1762, Mr Mackell. at the expence of Lord Napier, 
took another furvey of the projected canal, and gave alfo 
an eftimate of the money which would be necc-flary to 

cairj 



of Falkirk.

•carry the defign into execution. Mr Mackell's report at- 
trafted the attention of the Board of Truftees appointed for 
the Encouragement of the Fiflieries and Manufactures of 
Scotland ; and at their requeft, Mr Smeaton in like man- 
ner took the bufinefs under his confideration, and gave in 
an eftimate of the expence. 

After various attempts, a bill was fan&amp;ioned by Parlia- 
ment, which gave powers for raifing a flock of 1500 fliares 
for the purpofe of making a canal between the Forth and 
Clyde. Each mare was to confift of L. 100, and the whole 
capital would thus amount to L. 150,000. 

On the 10th of July 1768 this great work was begun 
under the direction of Mr Smeaton. The operations com- 
menced at the eaft end, and the late Sir Laurence Dundas 
of Kerfe, Baronet, cut and removed the firft fpadeful of 
earth which was taken from the canal. The fpade is yet 
kept in Kerfe houfe in memory of that tranfa&amp;ion, which 
was the beginning of an undertaking, great in the defign, 
and difficult in the execution ; but happy in its effects, and 
likely to be of unfpeakable advantage to fucceeding gene- 
rations. 

On the 10th of July 1775, the canal was fit for naviga- 
tion as far weft as Stockingfield, which is within a few 
miles of Glafgow. About two years afterwards a fide 
branch was cut, by which vefiels could go ft ill nearer Glaf- 
gow, and a bafon, together with granaries, and other build- 
ings, were prepared. By this time the Company's public 
funds were exhaufted ; for the making of canals being then 
in its infancy in Britain, the manner of doing the bufinefs 
an the eafieft way was not underftood, and confequently 
the work was carried on at a much greater expence than it 
could be done for now, although the value of labour is much 
increafed. 

Vol. XIX. M The

Statijlical Account 



The canal remained in this landing and unfinifhed 
forte, till by the afiinance of Government, the managers 
Were enabled to begin their operations again in July I? 86. 
The work was conduced by Mr Robert Whitworth, and 
on the 28th of July 1790, the navigation from fea to fea 
was opened. When, by the intervention of the canal, a 
communication between the eaftern and weftern feas was 
completed, the event was finalized by the charaderiltic 
ceremony of pouring a hogfread full of the water of the 
frith of Forth into the river Clyde *, amidft the -fit outs and 
approbation of an aftonifhed multitude. 

When we confider the novelty of the undertaking, and 
the difficulty of the enterprife, we fhall not be furprifed to 
find, that it was %% years and 18 days in being finiflied. 
The canal in its courfe paffes through marlhes, and over 
livers, rivulets, and roads. There is a confiderable aque- 
,du&amp; bridge, which conveys it over the Glafgow and Stir- 
ling road, a little to the weft ward of Falkirk. But the 
moft magnificent is that having four arches, which conduces 
it over the river Kelvin, where the valley in which it runs 
is 400 feet wide, and the depth from the fummit of the 
middle arches to the channel of the river is more than 65 
feet. 

The fide cut, which has already been mentioned, was 
carried forward to within half a mile of Glafgow. Larger 
and more commodious bafons were made ; necelTary build- 
ings were ere&amp;ed ; there is land to be fold for building a 
village, and the place is called Port Dundas, in honour of 
Lord Dundas. From this port there is a junction made with 
the Monkland Canal, which i. a fmall cut running 1 a 
miles into the country on the eafi of Glafgow, for the pur- 
pofe of conveying coals into that city. 

The

The length of the great eanal is 35 miles ; the collateral 
cut to Glafgow 2$ ; and that from Port Dundas to the 
Monkland Canal, 1 mile ; in whole, 38^ miles. This ex- 
tenfive track of a canal is fupplied with water bj fix refer* 
voirs, which cover about 409 acres of land, and contain 
about 12.679 lock-fulls of water; and the Company have 
it in their power to increafe the number of refervoirs. 

The fummit of the canal is 141 feet above the level of 
the fea *. The number of the locks is 20 on the eaft, and 
19 on the weft. The length of the locks between the gates 
is 74 feet, and the width between the walls 20 feet. The 
medium breadth of the canal at the furface is 56 feet, and 
at the bottom 27. Veflels of 80 or 90 tons, properly 
conftrudted, may be navigated through, and are fit for 

voy ages 

* The fummit of the canal was at firft but 140 feet. One foot in 
height was afterwards added to all the lock-gates, which has made fome 
people conclude, that as 20 locks are on the eaft, the fummit muft jnow 
be 160 feet. But though the water throughout the canal be one foot 
deeper, yet the fummit is only raifed 12 inches. The firft lock from the 
fea does now elevate veflels 8 feet; but the increafed height of this lock 
raifes the water on the next one foot ; thus the upper gate of the ad lock, 
which was 7 feet above the level of the water on the lower fide, is redu- 
ced to 6 feet, and confequenrly, when a foot is added to its height, it only, 
as formerly, raifes the veflel 7 feet. The fame thing happens to the third 
lock, and fo on through the whole ; and when you arrive at the fummit, 
the boat is only one toot higher than it would have been before the addi- 
tion was made to the gates, and this foot was gained at the firft lock. 

The circumftance of there being 20 locks on the eaft fide of the fum- 
mit, and only 19 on the weft, may be accounted for as follows :— *On the 
eaft, the canal terminates in the Grangeburn, where there is fo little 
water, that the veflels are left nearly dry at ebb tide; whereas 011 the 
weft, it ends in the Clyde, where the water is 8 feet deep without the 
help of the tide, and thus one lock is faved. 

'l'he revenue arifing from the canal was annually increafihg from the 
commencement till 1792, when it amounted to about L. 14,000. By the 
ftagnation of trade in I79 3, it did not reach L. 12,000 ; but in 1794, it 
was fomewhat more than L. 12,000.

voyages by fea. The tonnage dues are 2 d. per ton every 
mile, with fome exceptions, refpefting lime, &amp;c. The di- 
rection of the canal is under a Governor, Council in Lon- 
don, and a Committee at Glafgow, who meet monthly. 
They are chofen annually, by a general meeting, which is 
held in London every month of March. 

The extenfive trade carried on through this canal fug 
gefted to Sir Lawrence Dundas the propriety of building a 
village and quay near the eaft enci of it on his own eftate. 
The place which he fixed upon for this purpofe was the 
angle which isformed by the junction of the river Carron 
and the canal. They were begun to be built in the year 
1777 ; the village is now of confiderable extent, and is call- 
ed Grangemouth. 

Veffels bring into this port timber and hemp, deals, flax, 
and iron, from the Baltic, Norway, and Sweden, and grain 
from foreign markets, as well as from the coafts of Scot- 
land and England. The trade to London is carried on by 
the Carron Shipping Company, who in their veffels con* 
vey to that place goods which are made at Carron, together 
with other articles of commerce ; and when they return r 
they bring grocery goods, dye-fluffs, &amp;c. for the fupply of 
Glafgow, Paifley, Greenock, Falkirk, Stirling, and many 
of the inland towns of the weft country. 

The tonnage at this port is, at a medium, nearly as fok 
lows : Veffels belonging to England, which bring cargoes 
from foreign places, about 50Q0 tons annually ; ditto, from 
England, which carry on a coafting trade, about 4000 tons 
annually ; thofe belonging to Scotland, which are employed 
in foreign traffic, about 10,000 tons annually j thofe which- 
carry on the coafting trade are about 9000 tons annually

ally to Grangemouth, may be eftimated in their tonnage

at 2000. Great quantities of herrings made their appear- 
ance laft winter in the frith of Forth, and many of them 
were caught at the very mouth of the river Carron. More 
than ' i ao fail from Greenock, Rothfay, Stranraer, &amp;c 
came through the canal to fifh, and they returned home- 
wards with full cargoes. 

At Grangemouth, there is great need of additional 
warehoufes and ihades. But what is moft of all wanted is 
a cuftomhoufe, or branch thereof. Borrowftounnefs ha. 
ving till of late been the principal place of trade in this 
neighbourhood, a cuftomhoufe was eftabliflied there, and 
fufRcient attention has not yet been paid to the fituation of 
Grangemouth. Thofe at this port, who have bufinefs to* 
do in the cuftomhoufe, are obliged to travel to Borrow- 
ftounnefs, which is eight miles diftant ; and when the river 
Avon is not fordable, they are under the neceffity of going 
round by Linlithgow- bridge, which lengthens the journey 
four miles. 

But the Carron iron-works have in a peculiar manner 
tended to improve this town and neighbourhood. They 
are fituated on the northern banks of the river Carron ; 
and though they are not in this pariih, yet many of the 
workmen live in it, and as they are not two miles from the 
town of Falkirk, the fhops and markets thereof are gene- 
rally reforted to by thofe who are employed in the various 
operations of that extenfive manufacture. 

The Carron Company have a charter for employing a 
capital of L. 150,000. It is divided into 600 lhares, and 
no perfon can have a vote in the management, unlefs he be 
poffeffed of ten fliares. Thefe works were firft projected 
and eftabliflied by Dr Roebuck, and Meflrs Cadell and 
Garbet. They 'were joined by other gentlemen of refpec- 
tability, and the Company are now in a very flouriihing 

condition-

condition. The works are under the immediate direaion 
of Mr Jofeph Stainton, who is alfo a partner. 

They are fupplied with iron-ore from Lancafliire and 
Cumberland ; and with ironftone from Banton, Denny, 
and Bonnyhill, &amp;c. in this vicinity, and from the county 
of Fife, &amp;c. They have limeftone from Burntifland, &amp;c. 
and coals from Kinnaird, Carron-hall, and Shieldhill. All 
the materials, which are made ufe of at thefe works are 
brought to them by water-carriage, except coals, and thefe 
are found in their neighbourhood. At an average they 
ufe 800 tons of coal, 400 tons of iron ftone and ore, and ico 
tons of limeftone per week. The ironftone is firft calcined 
in an open fire ; but the iron-ore needs no preparation in 
Order to be fit for the blaft furnace. 

There are five furnaces of this defcription, which are 
fupplied with ftrong currents of air from caft iron cylinders, 
inftead of bellows. Thefe cylinders are conftru&amp;ed fome- 
what like forcing pumps, and are not only more durable 
than bellows, but have more power, and produce a better 
effe&amp;. They have three cupolas, which receive a proper 
fupply of air by means of pipes connected with the forcing 
cylinders. There are alfo fifteen furnaces, which are kept 
in adlion by the external air, without the aid of any arti- 
ficial blaft. 

At Carron all kinds of caft iron goods are made in the 
belt manner. A fhort kind of cannon called Carronades 
were invented there j and, in certain lituations, they are 
conlidered as of great importance. They are moved in 
grooves; and thus the increafed ' fri&amp;ion more effectually 
pppofes the force of the recoil. The caliber of the cannon is 
bored out of the folid metal, and thus the hole is more 
fmooth and juft in its direction, than when caft with a core, 
and the piece is Iefs ready to burft in time of a&amp;ion. The 

outfide 



of Falkirk. 95 

outlide of the cannon is turned by proper inftruments, and 
the whole is not only neat, but fubftantial. 

At thefe works bar iron is alfo made ; and in accom- • 
pliftiing that bufinefs, the following method is purfued : j 

The pig iron is melted in a finery, where coke is ufed ; 
while hot, it is beaten out into plates about an inch in 
thicknefe. Thefe plates are afterwards broken into pieces 
about two inches fquare, for the convenience of fcouring 
them, &amp;c. They are then fcoured in an iron cylinder, 
which is connected with the water-wheel, and when they 
are properly prepared by this operation, they are put into 
pots, which are made of fire clay, and in an air-furnace 
they are brought to a welding heat •, in this ftate of pre- 
paration they are put under the hammer, and wrought into 
blooms ; the blooms are heated in a chafery, or hollow 
fire, and then drawn into bars for various ufes. In this 
condition the iron is equal in goodnefs to that which is im- 
ported from Ruffia under the name of new fable iron. 

The machinery is moved by the water of the river Car- 
ron, and for a fupply in time of drought, they have a re- 
fervoir to the extent of about 30 acres. But as this pre- 
caution is not enough in very dry feafons, they have more- 
over an engine for throwing back the water that it may be 
ufed again, and this engine raifes 4 tons every ftroke, and 
makes about 7 ftrokes in a minute. If we take into the 
account, along with the people who are direaiy employed 
in the manufacture at Carron, thofe alfo who are engaged 
in the mines and pits, together with thofe who carry mate- 
rials to the works, and goods by fea and otherwife imme- 
diately from them, we may eftimate the whole at 2000 
people. 

Nobody is admitted to view the works on Sundays, ex- 
cept thofe who are properly recommended, or known to 
be worthy of attention. Mr Burns, the Ayrlhire poet,

Remarkable 

* William Fullarton, Efq; of Fullarton, in the county of Ayr, North 
Britain, has obtained a patent for making cad and malleable iron after a 
new method. He calcines the iron ftone or ore, if it be neceffary, redu- 
ces it to powder, bolt* it, feparates the extraneous matter, and then puts 
it into a furnace, along with a fufficient quantity of coke, or charcoal; 
The furnace is intended to a£t as a crucible ; and the metal, when fluid, 
is not to be drawn off, and caft into pigs, but is to remain as a loop at the 
bottom. When it is taken out thence, it does not require to be melted 
again, but after being heated may, without any other procefs, be beate» 
into baxs. 

The principal advantages, which appear to attend the method pro- 
pofed by Mr Fullarton muft arife from his manner of preparing the 
iron ftone or ore, and from ^permitting the metal to cool gradually ia 
the furnace ; to which may be added the removing of the flag, which he 
Cakes care to do while the fufion is going forward. From the fpecifica- 
tion which he has given, it feems as if pulverifing the iron ftone or ore, 
and freeing it of extraneous matter, precludes the neceflity, and faves the 
expence of ufing limeftone as a flax; and cooling the metal gradually, 
prevents that brittlenefs which caft iron and fteel poffefs when they are 
cooled on a ftidden ; and thus the loop is in a better ftate of preparation 
#»r being put under the hammer.

Remarkalle Events.— Margaret, commonly called by hi- 
ftorians the Maiden of Norway, died at Orkney, on her 
way to Britain, where me was to have been crowned fuc- 
ceflbr to her grandfather Alexander III, of Scotland. Upon 
her death there was much agitation in the kingdom, and 
many competitors fprang up for the Crown. But of all 
thofe who laid in their claims, the rights of Robert Bruce 
tind John Balliol * appeared to be moft worthy of invefti- 
gation and mpport. On the fide of one or other of thefe 
opponents were the people of Scotland generally arranged. 
As the conteft was violent, and not likely to be brought to 
a fpeedy iffue, it was refolved to fubmit the whole bufi- 
nefs to the decifion of Edward I. of England. He accept- 
ed of the offer with much pleafure, and took that opportu- 
nity 

But if I fully underftand the fpecificafion, Mr Fullarton's method muft 
%e fubject to feveral inconveniencjes. Either the furnace muft be very 
fmall, or it will be difficult to remove the regulus after it has remained 
there till it be cold, and the work muft fuffer an interruption by waiting 
fo long before a new charge can be put in. In order to obviate thefe 
inconveniencies, it might be proper to draw off the metal in the fluid ftate, 
and having caft it into pigs of the ufual form, put them while hot into a 
furnace, expofed to a well regulated heat, and fuffered gradually to be- 
come cool. 

A gentleman, who was taken by the French during the laft American 
war, having efcaped from prifon, was travelling homeward, and on his 
way, in pafling through a valley among the Pyrenean mountains, came to 
a fmall forge, where fome men were making iron from the ore. They 
fifted it, and having mixed it with charcoal, put it by fmall quantities at 
a time into a furnace. They let it remain till it was duly fufed. Then they 
put a bar of iron among the metal, to which a kno-b adhered, and when 
it had acquired a proper confiftency, they beat it with a hammer, re- 
peating the operation, till, in aftiort time, they had made a bar of consi- 
derable length. This method is recommended by its fimplicity, and per- 
haps it may fuggeft fome-thing for the improvement of making bar-iron 
in this country.

iiity of con fufion, uncertainty, and terror, to have him felf 
proclaimed Lord Paramount of Scotland; and finding Bal- 
liol not unwilling to acknowledge this fupremacy, he de- 
cided the conteft in his favour. But Edward foon hurled 
him from the throne, under the pretence that he had only 
put the fceptre into his hands to be fwayed in truft. The 
troops of the Englifh monarch foon over-ran many of the 
moft important diftritts of this kingdom ; and in triumph 
carried to Weftminfter the ftone of Scone, which was made 
fomewhat in the form of a chair, in which the Kings of 
Scotland had been in ufe to be feated at the time of their 
coronation. 

In this feafon of national dejection and difmay, appeared 
William Wallace, of an ancient, but at that time an ob- 
fcure family *. He lifted up the ftandard of liberty, and 
many flocked around the Jignal. But ftill there were not 
a few, who through envy or fear would not join the pa- 
triots. But Wallace and his adherents prevailed. They 
fought and were fuccefsful. They drove the Englifh be- 
yond the borders, and entered the countries in the north of 
Edward's kingdom. 

When the King of England was informed of thefe events, 
he returned from the continent where he had been with an 
army ; and marching into Scotland, he advanced with vic- 
torious bands through that country, meeting with little re- 
fiftance till he came to Falkirk. 

Having come within view of the Scotch army, they faw 
them drawn up in battle array, fomewhat more than half 
a mile north from Falkirk. Before this time many perfons 
of eminence and power had joined the party of W allace.

under review, the following names are the chief of thofe 
which have been preferved on record : John Corny n, or 
Cuming, of Badenoch, the younger; Sir John Stewart of 
Bonkill, and not of Bute, as tradition has handed it down. 
This gentleman was brother to the Steward of Scotland, 
from whom the firname of Stewart, or Stuart, was taken. 
To thefe we muft add Sir John Graham* of Abercorn ot 
Dundaff; and Macdtiff, the uncle of the Earl of Fife f. 

Wallace had arranged his infantry in four bodies, of a 
circular form, with the convex fide toward the enemy ; the 
archers formed a line between the circles ; and the cavalry- 
were placed at a little diftance in the rear. The ftrength 
of Edward's army confifted of cavalry, which were drawn 
up in three lines ; and the third, which was intended to be 
kept as a corps of referve, was commanded by the king 
himfelf. Nothing being faid of the manner in which the 
Englilh infantry were difpofed, we are naturally led to 
believe, that they were not numerous. 

A morafs, which was in front of the Scotch army, but 
is now drained by the canal, prevented the troops of Ed- 
ward from attacking the Scotch in front; but wheeling to 
the right and left, they flanked them cn both fides, and 
the carnage was dreadful. Struck with a panic by the fall 
of Graham, Stewart, and Macduff, and preffed by 'the well 
appointed cavalry of England, they were compelled, after 
a brave refiftance, to abandon the conflict, and leave the 
victory in the hands of Edward. 

Sir John Graham and Sir John Stewart were both buried 
in the church-yard of Falkirk. The ftone which was laid 
on the grave of Sir John Graham had fome fculpture upon 
it, which the hand of time was faft obliterating. At length

another ftone was erecled with decorations, and an epitaph, 
the whole being fupported by pillars. When the letters 
of the infcription were nearly defaced, another of a fimilar 
kind was put over it ; and when it alfo had fuffered confi. 
derably by the lapfe of time, the late William Graham of 
Airth, Efq; erected a third, after the fame manner as the 
two former. The infcriptions are as follow :

Nor was gude Grame of truth and hardiment. 

Not far from the tomb of Sir John Graham lie the afW 
of Sir John Stewart. The place of his reft is but a few feet 
from the eaft end of the church, and near the fouth corner 
of it. Though Sir John was nearly allied to the progeni- 
tors of the houfe of Stuart, whofe kindred blood flows in 
the veins of many illuftrious families of Great Britain, and 
alfo in not few of the princes and potentates of the earth, 
yet his grave is not marked out, except by a ftone without 
a name, and is the fegment of an o&amp;agon. 

Much has been faid with refped to difcontents, which are 
reprefented as having fu-bfifted among the leaders of the 
Scotch army on the eve of the battle. The peevifh de- 
parture of the well-tried patriots, Wallace and Cuming, 
cannot be received but upon the moft authentic documents. 
Jarrings might have prevailed among a number of leaders, 
where the fubordination of regular government was not 
obferved f but from the character of the men, and the cir- 
oumftances of the cafe, no fault feems to have been com- 
mitted.

mitted, which was cither difgraceful to therafelves, or hurt- 
ful to the iffue of the day *. 

In the reign of Charles I. the Earl of Lanark, who was 
afterwards the ad Duke of Hamilton, together with a per- 
fon of the name of Monro, being friendly to the King, at- 
tacked with their troops, near Stirling, the army which 
had been raifed by the Marquis of Argyle, and the Earls 
of Caffilis, Eglintoun, and Loudon. The former were re- 
pulfed, and fled to Falkirk ; but a temporary accommoda- 
tion ftopt for a time the effufion of human blood. 

In the battle of Dunbar, Cromwell was fuccefsful, anil 
he marched forward to give Charles II. battle, who was 
encamped with his army at the Torwood in this neighbour- 
hood, and had then been proclaimed King of Scotland. On 
his route, Cromwell ftovmed, and took Callander houfej, 
where Charles had a garrifon. 

The Earl of Arran, when Governor of Scotland, did, 
with the confent of his party, agree to give Mary, the 
young Queen of Scots, in marriage to Prince Edward, the 
heir to the Englifb throne. But having at Callander houfe 
met with Cardinal Beaton and the Earl of Murray, leaders 
of the oppofite party, a negociation was entered into, 
which broke the matrimonial treaty. 

It appears, that Mary Queen of Scots vilited Lord Li- 
vingfton at Callander houfe, anno 1565 f. 

In the year 1745, when the troops of Great Britain were 
in Flanders fupporting the houfe of Auftria againft the arms 
of France, the grandfon of James II. who, at the revolution

afferted his father's pretentions to the throne of thefe king- 
doms. This meafure was, without doubt, agreeable to the

French Court, as it would evidently be the mean of with- 
drawing our forces from the continent. Perhaps it was 
even fuggeftedbv them; and we know that they gave a 
imall fupply of money an,d arms. 

Charles, flu/hed with the hopes of power, eminence, and 
royalty, failed from a port in Brittany on the 15th of 
July, and in a fhort time landed in the Highlands of Scot- 
land. There he inftantly drew together a confidence 
number of partisans, and marched direftly to Edinburgh. 
He got pofleffion of the town of Edinburgh, lodged in the 
palace of Holyroodhoufe,. and foon afterwards engaged at 
Preflon, near Muflelburgh, a few of the King's troops, who 
were under the command of Sir John Cope. Here he was 
vidonous ; and in the anxious expedation of future fuccefs 
marched into England, as far as Derby, by the way of 
Carhfle. Though he had many friends near the road by 
which he went, yet prudence permitted but a few of them 
to follow his fortune. 

Difappointed in his views, he returned by Glafgow, 
marched to Stirling, and laid fiege to the caftle. By this 
time a confiderable number of the King's troops were af- 
fembled near Edinburgh, commanded by Lieutenant-Gene- 
ral Ha wley. He marched for the relief of Stirling; and 
having flopped to refrefh the troops at Falkirk, he encamped 
with them between the glebe and the field where Sir John 
Graham fell in defence of liberty and his country. 

On the 17th of January 1746 the alarm was given, that 
the Prince's followers were advancing by the Torwood. 
By different means they attempted to deceive the army of 
the King. They left a ftandard at the place where they 
had halted on their way from Bannockburn, which, being 
feen at Falkirk, would, they fuppofed, hufh their opponents 
into a temporary fecurity. They alfo fent a fmall detach- 
ment by the north fide of the river Carron, that it might

appear, if there was any alarm, that they intended to at- 
tack the King's camp on the left ; but, in the mean time, 
the principal body of their forces were led ftraight for- 
ward, and crofted the ford of Carron, at Dunipace, about 
the diftance of three miles to the weft-ward. 

No fooner was this difcovered than the drums at Fal- 
kirk camp beat to battle. ' But the General not being pre- 
fent, they were detained fo long before his arrival, that the 
enemy had gained an eminence, which is about a mile fouth- 
weft from this town. The way thither being rugged, the 
cannon could not be dragged up time enough for the ac- 
tion ; fwampy ground rendered the cavalry almoft ufelefs, 
and a tremendous ftorm of wind and rain blowing diredtly 
againft the face of the national troops, added to the unfor- 
tunate circumftances of the day. Notwithftanding the 
bravery of Major-General Hufk, and other officers, the 
King's forces were worfted ; many were killed, feveral ta- 
ken prifoners, and the reft fled to Linlithgow. 

Among the perfons of rank who were left dead on the 
field were Sir Robert Monro of Foulis, Bart, and his bro- 
ther Duncan, a phyfician. Sir Robert, in the retreat, was 
furrounded by the enemy, and after a defperate refiftance, 
yielded to the ftroke of death. The phyfician, from the 
affe&amp;ion which he had for his brother, left the peace and 
fweets of retired life, and followed him through the din of 
arms, and the dangers of battle. In the difcharge of this 
amiable office, he fell a viftim to kindnefs and brotherly 
attachment. They were buried befide each other in the 
church-yard of Falkirk ; a fuperb monument was erected 
to their memory ; and the circumftances of their death are 
recorded by fuitable infcriptions. The number of forces 
which were led to adlion that day was about 6000 of the

intcreft of the Prince; but the true amount of his troops has 
not been exactly ascertained. 

Hawley found means to vindicate himfelf to his Sove- 
reign ; but the impreffions of his conduft which remain 
here, are by no means favourable to his character, as a Ge- 
neral entrufted with an important command. If we credit 
report, he was dining that day at Callander houfe with 
Lady Kilmarnock, whofe Lord had then declared himfelf 
in favour of the young adventurer, and was at that time 
actually engaged in his fervices fomewhere in the ifland. 

The action began about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and 
by the evening the Prince's army were in pofleffion of the 
town of Falkirk. One of the fons of Macdonell of Glen- 
gary, when walking in the principal ftreet, foon after he 
had arrived from the field of battle, was fliot from a win- 
dow by a mulket-bullet. He did not inllantly die ; but 
having languiflied a few days, he expired. His death was 
accidental, for it was occafioned by one of his own men, 
whofe gun had miffed fire during the engagement, and not 
being apprifed of this circumftance, while he was cleaning 
his piece, the mot went off at the expence of a life, which 
he would have done much to fave. But fuch was the vio- 
lence, zeal and diftruft which prevailed, that he was found 
guilty, and mot in this neighbourhood. Soon after the 
battle of Falkirk, the Prince's troops were vanquifhed and 
difperfed at Culloden. Thus tranquillity was reftored to 
the nation ; and we truft, that the horrors of civil war will 
never again prevail in the land. 

Eminent and Remarkable CharaBers. — The Livingltons

King Malcolm Canmore, about the year 1075. We find, 
that different branches of this family were employed in 
fome of the raoft important fituations and tranfa&amp;ions of 
this country *. 

In the progrefs of fociety there arofe among them the 
three diftinguifhed families of Linlithgow, Callander, and 
Kilfy th. The Vifcount Kilfy th, and the Earl of Linlith- 
gow and Callander, were found guilty of rebellion in 17 15, 
had their eftates confifcated, and their titles forfeited. The 
titles of Linlithgow and Callander at this time centered in 
the fameperfon, and the Earl found means to efcape to the 
continent, where he died. Sir Thomas Livingfton of Bed- 
lormie and Weftquarter, Baronet, is lineal heir of the fa- 
mily. 

Lady Ann, the only furviving child of the lafl Earl of 
Linlithgow and Callander, was married to the Earl of Kil- 
marnock, who joined the followers of the Prince in the 
year 1745, and was beheaded for treafon on Towerhill, oh 
the 18th of Auguft 1746, in the 42d year of his age. His 
infidelity to the King is the more remarkable, as his family 
had always been loyal, and as he himfelf, at the beginning 
of the commotions in which he afterwards was an abettor, 
had exerted himfelf considerably in behalf of the reigning 
family. 

The truth feems to be, that as he was not in opulent cir- 
cumftances, he was induced to become an adventurer ; and 
from his marriage-conne£tion, he was in hopes that if the 
Prince fucceeded, he would be raifed to the poffemons and 
perhaps to the honours of the forfeited and deceafed Earl 
of Linlithgow and Callander. And this leads me to ob- 
ferve, that it is politio in a Itate to inflict as few permanent 
labilities and punifliments as the nature of government

and good order will permit. If a man falls a juft viclim 
to the law, the galling remembrance js gradually deftroyed 
among his connexions and dependents ; but if an eftate be 
forfeited, or a civil privilege be permanently taken away, 
there is a perpetual brooding over the misfortune, and from 
this fource there often fprings the bitternefs of ftrife. 

Our Government have, with much prudence and huma- 
nity, reftored the eftates which were confiscated in 1746 ; 
and it is much to be lamented, that fomething efFe&amp;ual has 
not been devifed for the heirs of thofe who furfered by the 
forfeitures in the year 17 16. The eftates having been 
otherwife Jong ago difpofed of, could not be reftored; but 
the wifdom of thofe in power, among the many refources 
which they have, might perhaps find out the means of at 
jteaft a fmall compenfation. 

The eftate of Kerfe, in this parifti, once belonged to the 
Hopes, a family of considerable note and antiquity in this 
country. John de Hope was one of the barons who fub- 
jnitted to Edward I. of England in 1296, when he had in- 
vaded Scotland. 

Kerfe, as well as many other eftates in Scotland, were 
purchafed by Sir Thomas Hope, who, as an advocate, 
made a confpicuous figure. 

In the revolutionary period of the Scotch church, fix 
minifters, who had denied that the King had any power in 
Ccclefiaftical affairs, were cpmmitted to the caftle of Black- 
nefs, and for high treafon were brought to trial at Linlith- 
gow, Jan. 10. 1606. No counfellor of eminence, not even 
Sir Thomas Craig, the procurator for the church, could be 
prevailed upon to ftand forward as their advocate at the 
bar of the Court. Mr Thomas Hope, for he was not then 
created a baronet, undertook, though but a young man, to 
plead their caufe. His forcible elocution, his ingenious, 
1 ' ' though 



of Falkirk 



10 7 



though unfuccefsful exertions, procured him admiration, 
and brought him into notice. 

He was not only confulted in all difficult cafes by the 
Prefbyterians, but was efteemed by the Court party, and 
was King's Advocate, both in the reign of James VI. and 
Charles I. He had three fons, who were Lords of Seffion, 
and two of them fat upon the Bench as Judges, while he 
himfelf was at the bar. The Lord Advocate has a right 
to plead with his hat on, and tradition fays, that { this privi- 
lege was introduced in the time of Sir Thomas Hope, as it 
was thought unbecoming the dignity of a father in his fi- 
tuation to plead with his head uncovered before his fons. 
But it is more probable, that the cuftom was introduced 
as a diftinguifliing mark of refpeft to the King's Advocate. 

Sir Thomas, his feeond fon, to whom he gave the eftate 
of Kerfe, was eminent in the law, and, I believe, the only 
commoner who ever has been Lord Juftice-General of 
Scotland ; as his father, Sir Thomas of Craighall in Fife, 
was the only perfon not honoured with a title of nobility, 
who at any time, in the character of Lord High Commif- 
fioner, reprefented his Majefty in the General AlTerably 
of this church. The eftate of Kerfe was fold fometime 
ago to the late Sir Laurence Dundas, Baronet, father of 
Lord Dundas, the prefent proprietor. 

Antiquities. — In the barony of Seabegs, near the canal, 
there is an artificial mound of earth, where courts and de- 
liberative councils were formerly held, as appears by the 
name Mote, which the place yet retains. There is alfo a 
fmall burying ground, where formerly there was a Roman 
Catholic chapel. 

In different parts of this neighbourhood there have been, 
dug up urns, filled with allies, and ftone coffins, containing 
human bones. Somewhat more than twenty years ago, 

there 



Statiftical Account 



there was found, in a hollow of a freeftone quarry near 
Caftlecary, fome wheat, which had become black, and was 
fuppofed to have been there, from the time that the Ro- 
mans poffeffed that ftation. 

The fmall river Bonney, which feparates a part of this 
parifh from Denny and Dunipace, feems to be the Cronan 
of Offian. 

Old. Camelon * not Camehdunum, but probably Bede's 
Guidi, appears to have been formerly a place of confe- 
quence. There are now few veftiges of it remaining ; but 
not long ago, foundations of houfes, and the direction of 
fome of the ftreets, were vifible. Much has been faid about 
the importance which it once had ; we have heard of the 
riches and ornaments of royalty which were found there, 
when it was taken by the Romans. But we have no au- 
thentic documents by which we can decide whether it was 
a habitation of fome of the ancient tribes of North Britain,, 
or whether it was only a Roman ftation. 

It is alfo reported, that Camelon was a fea-port town 
and in confirmation of this we are told, that an anchor 
was formerly dug up f in the ground near it. There are 
circumfiances which authorife us to conclude, not only that 
the river Carron has been navigable farther up than the 
place where Camelon flood, but alfo that the fea came 
very near Falkirk, and covered the whole of that diftrict 
which is now called the Carfe. The name Carfe in Scot- 
land is generally applied to that land which has been form- 
ed by the retreat or exclufion of the fea. Our carfe lands 
are very little raifed above the level of the frith of Forth, 
and in many places are defended by banks %. The Carfe,

of Falkirk. 



which is very valuable in quality, might eafily be enlarged 
by encroaching farther on the fea. Lord Dundas, by this 
method, has lately added about 70 acres to his eftate. 
About the beginning of this century, a Dutchman, who 
was well acquainted with operations like thefe in Holland, 
propofed to the Duke of Hamilton to gain for him acoo 
acres off the fea, adjoining his eft-ate of Kinneal, in the pa- 
rim of Borrowftounnefs, provided he mould be allowed to 
poffefs it rent free for forty years, and be furniftied with 
timber, &amp;c. from the Duke's wood in the neighbourhood. 
The propofal was rejected ; and the fea continues to roll 
its tides over thofe mallows, where fruitful fields might 
now have been yielding an annual income of L. 4000 or 
L. 5000 to the proprietor, and a coniiderable quantity of 
provifions for the fupply of this populous part of the 
country. 

But the mod prominent feature of antiquity in, this pa- 
rifh is the Roman wall, built in the reign ofHhe Emperor 
Antoninus Pius, under the direction of his Lieutenant Lol- 
lius Urbicus. It in general follows the track where Agri- 
cola had previoufly eredfed a chain of forts. It is more 
than 1600 years fince the wall was built, and jet in feve- 
ral parts, both in this parifti and elfewhere, its form and 
courfe are vilible. It extends from the frith of Forth to 
the river Clyde, and was about 40 Roman, or 37 Englifh 
miles in length. Carriden, Kinneal, and Blacknefs, on the 
eaft, Dumglas and Old Kirkpatrick on the weft, have, by 
different people, been fuggefted as its boundaries. Bede 
fays, that it began two miles from the monaftery of Aber- 
corn, and ended at Alcluith, which appears to be the fame 
place which is now called Dumbarton *. If the wall ter- 
minated

Statijiical Account 



mmated at Old Kirkpatrick, Dumbarton was probably a 
fort belonging to the Romans; and we know, that on the 
eaft coaft their forts and ftations were carried far beyond 
the end of the wall *. 

This wall, or rather defenfive work, corififted of a ditch 
on the north, and a wall on the fouth. It varies as to the 
breadth of the ditch ; but is never lefs than 12 or 15 feet 
wide, and the wall was about 12 feet thick at the founda- 
tion +. The ditch was deep in proportion to its breadth ; 
and the wall was high in proportion to its width. Not- 
withftanding what has been faid by fome authors, no part 
of this wall appears to have been built of ftone, except in 
fwampy places, where the nature of the ground required 
it. Forts or ftations, and between thefe, turrets or watch- 
towers, were erected for the accommodation of foldicrs to 
defend it ; and as they were at no great diftance from one 
another, a general alarm could be given at the approach of 
danger.; Hence the vulgar belief that the wall was hollow, 
and that the found of a trumpet which was blown at one 
end could be heard at the other. Cafllecary, Roughcaftle, 
and Camelon, were the moft remarkable f6rts or ftations in 
this neighbourhood. The fite of the two former are ftill to 
be feen. 

Much light has been thrown on the hiflory of this wall 
by (tones with inscriptions, which have been dug up in va- 
rious parts of it. A confiderable number of thefe ftones 
are in the College of Glafgow, &amp;c. ; one in Sir John Clerk's 
collection, and one in Callander houfe, with the following 
infcription :

From 

* Sibbald's Enquiries. 

f The ditch in Callander park is aboye 43 feet wide; in fome other 
places it is not fo much by half. 



of Falkirk. HI 

From thefe different ftones it appears, th at the wall was 
chiefly made by the 2d and aoth legions, and the vexilla- 
tions of the €th and 20th, together with a cohort of auxil- 
liaries * Every ioodth part of a legion was called a cen- 
tury, and had a vexillum, or pair of colours. To guard 
thefe, ten of the beft foldiers were allotted for each vexil- 
lum, and thofe guards, which in every legion amounted to 
1000 men, were called its vexillation. 

This rampart is denominated by Buchanan, in his Hi- 
ftory of Scotland, the wall of Severus. Other writers have 
alfo given it the fame name ; but though it may have been 
repaired by Severus, as it was by different people, yet the 
wall which he built was not in this diftrid of the country, 
but was drawn between the Solway frith and Newcaftle, 
nearly in the fame direction in which Adrian had formerly 
built his. 

The wall of Antoninus is generally known in this coun- 
try by the name of Graham's Dike. Some are of opinion, 
that it derived this name from a powerful leader of that 
name, who broke through this famous line of defence, and 
routed the Britons on the fouth fide of it, who were then 
abandoned by the Romans. Others affirm, that in the 
reign of Malcom II. one Gryme, who was connected with 
the royal family, afpiring to the throne, drew together 
fome followers, and in order to fettle the commotion, the 
pretender got a grant for the tex"m of his life of all that 
part of Malcolm's kingdom which was on the north fide of 
the wall, and that the line of feparation was from this event 
called Gryme's Dike ; hence, by an eafy tranfition, Gra- 
ham's Dike. It has ilfo been fuggefted, that as the build- 
ing of this wall has been attributed to Severus, fo by trans- 
lating Severus into Englifli, you have Grim ; and in a 

country 



• Henry's Hiftory of Great Britain,

Statijllcal Account 



country where the firname of Graham is fo" common as it 
is here, it was very natural to find the appellation Grim's 
Wall, converted into Graham's Dyke *. The name itfelf 
is of little confequence, but the wall is a ftriking monu- 
ment of Roman activity. 

The foldiers of the Roman empire were not allowed to 
be enervated by idlenefs. They were conftantly employed, 
smd often engaged in fevere manual labour. Not only the 
walls which have been taken notice of, but alfo the various 
roads which they made in Great Britain are clear proofs, 
that they were called forth to exertion, and kept in a&amp;ive 
life. Along the foutfi fide of Graham's Dyke, a caufeway 
was formed for the more expeditious and comfortable tra- 
velling of the foldiers from one part of it to another. 

Nearly oppofite to Callander houfe, an earthen wall of 
confiderable height and thicknefs branches off from Gra- 
ham's Dyke, runs through Weft-quarterhoufe garden, and 
reaches the old caftle of Almond. From that toward the 
eaft, there are few or no certain traces of it to be feen ; but 
we may prefume, that it once ended at Linlithgow, where 
there was a Roman camp, on the very place where the 
King's palace was afterwards built. This wall has nofofle, 
and being broad at the top, was probably intended to be a 
road, as well as a line of defence.

*The following correBions and additions to the Statiflical 
Account of the parifb of Polmont (vol. III. p. 344.J are 
here inferted, at the requejl of the Rev. Mr William Finlay ; 

The parifli of Polmont is not interfered, but bounded by the frith of 
Forth, on the north, and by the river Avon on the eaft. A fmall part of it 
is interfered by a fbort cut from Grangemouth, which is now the only 
navigable communication betwixt the great canal and the' Forth. The 
iron ftone is fold by the proprietors of land to the Carron Company, not at 
tenpence per Jlone, but at tenpence per ton. The annual amount of the 
funds for relief of the poor is not L. aS, but about L. 55, and the expendi- 
ture nearly the fame. 'By an interlocutor of the Teind Court, June 1793, 
the ftipend of this parifli is ordained to be iji bolls, 2 firlots, 1 peck, and 
a lippies of bear, 56 bolls of meal, and L. 1 52 : 10 : 10 Scots money, with 
L. to money forefaid for furnifliing the communion-elements. The real

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1714424">ROXBURGH</name>, 



(County of Roxburgh, Synod of Merse and Twee»-

By the Rev. Mr Andrew Bell, Minijler of the Parijh,</head> 



<p>"ORevious to the Union of the Scotch and Englifli Par- 
liaments, this corner of the land was often the feat of 
war, and the unhappy fcene of broils and feuds, which 
ufually ftigmatize the border inhabitants of two hoftile 
kingdoms in a barbarous age. Roxburgh was the refidence 
and rendezvous of fome of the greateft military, political,

and magnificence becoming the dignity of affemblies, in 
whofe decifions many nations felt themfelves highly irtte- 
refted and concerned. Hence this parim affords great 
room for inveftigation, and opens a field, whereon the hi- 
ftoric genius might range with peculiar gratification. The 
following remarks, however, being intended to make part 
of a work, whofe objeft is Jiatijiical rather than hijiorkal 
enquiry, they are chiefly limited to local and exifling cir- 
cumftances. 

Name. — Like all etymological interpretations of the 
names of places, the meaning of this is extremely vague 
and uncertain. Camden calls the caftle of Roxburgh Mar- 
chidun, or the hill on the marches, alluding, not to the al- 
titude or fize, but to the ftrength and importance of that 
fortrefs. Some nomenclators fay, that Roxburgh is a con- 
traction for Rogue's Burgh, referring to the character of its 
ancient inhabitants, when marauding was the trade of all 
the borderers. Others affirm, that Roxburgh is the proper 
name, and derived from a Saxon word, Rox, fignifying 
ftrength : And others infift, that Rofeburgh (as it is vul- 
garly defigned) is the proper appellation of this place, 
being moft expreffive of its beautiful fituation. 

Situation.-~The old city of Roxburgh flood over againft 
Kelfo, on a rifing ground at the weft end of a fertile plain, 
peninfulated by the confluence of the rivers Tweed and 
Teviot. Thefe fong-renowned rivers flow here in all their 
glory •, but the Teviot has decidedly the preference, when 
imagination calls up to view the grand aflemblage of ob- 
jects that formerly lined her banks in this place. On 
-the fouth angle of a beautiful peninfulated tract of land, 
formed by the curvitures of the two rivers, is a rich 

fpot, 



Statiflical Account 



fpot of ground, where David I. built a magnificent 
friary for fome Ciftertian monks, whom he removed 
from Selkirk to Roxburgh ; on the middle flood the town, 
both under cover from the Caftle, which was fituated on a 
large oblong knoll to the weft, and feparated from the city 
by a narrow neck of land, formed by the proximity of the 
rivers. " The fouth walls of the Caftle impended over the 
" Teviot, a part of whofe waters were directed by a dam 
« thrown obliquely acrofs the ftream at the weft end of the 
«' Caftle into a deep foffe, which defended the fortrefs on 
" the weft and north, emptying itfelf into the river, at the 
" eaft end thereof *." Over this moat, at the gateway 
from the town, was thrown a draw-bridge, the remains of 
which were but lately removed. About two miles weft 
from the Caftle ftands the prefent village of Roxburgh, 
pleafantly fituated near the banks of the Teviot, on a de- 
clivity of fouthern expofure. It is divided by a fmall ri- 
vulet into the " Upper and Nether Towns," which had 
formerly been of confiderable extent, though they now con- 
tain only about 2co inhabitants. This village is the feat 
of the parochial church ; is nearly centrical to the whole 
parifh ; lies in the county which bears its name, and within 
the bounds of the Prefby tery of Kelfo, and Synod of Merfe 
and Teviotdale. 

Exte?it, Surface, a?id Boil. — The parifti extends about 
8 miles in length, and 4 in breadth at the extremities, in- 
cluding an area of 7000 acres of land. Its figure is irregular, 
and may be reprefented by a fpread eagle, with his head 
towards the north, his wings fhadowing eaft ward and weft- 
ward. The general appearance of the country is flat and 
floping. The foil is moftly a rich loam, well calculated 
for bearing turnips or wheat : The lands are therefore very 

valuable, 

* Pennant.

valuable, but rather unpleafant to labour, being hanky in 
ferae places. The fcirts of the parifh on the weft and iouth 
are moorifh. A great part of that tract of land which lies 
between the rivers, efpecially about the village, is fo ftony, 
that tradition reports it to have been once all covered with 
houfes. In very few places, however, have the ftones any 
appearance of having ever been ufed in building. 1 he 
orounds on the eaft end of the pariili, and thofe on the fouth 
fide of the Teviot, are inclofed with ditch and hedge. The 
fences, being in general grown up, and ornamented with 
hedge-rows of trees; befides, various woods, and little 
thickets, or clumps of wood, reared upon unarable knolls 
and rocky hillocks in feveral parts, make the country look 
rich and beautiful. The paxifti is- bounded by Maxton, 
Ancrum, and Crailing, on the weft ; by Crailing and Eck- 
ford, on the fouth ; by Kelfo, on the eaft ; by a part of 
Kelfo and Makerfton, on the north. 

Agriculture. — The greateft part of this parifh is in a very 
high ftate of cultivation, and yields an ample reward to the 
occupiers for their noil and expence in labour. Whether 
lying in pafture or in tillage, the fields every where around 
difplay the remarkable activity, agricultural fpirit, and Ikill 
of the farmers. Equal in all kinds of hufbandry within their 
fpheretoany in the kingdom, the landholders and farmers here 
are particularly attentive to the cultivation of potatoes, and, 
being favoured by the nature of the foil, have carried it 
to a very high degree of perfection. Three hundred fir- 
lots per acre is a frequent produce. They are planted in 
drills, the diftance between each plant fometimes about 
three feet, and are completely cleaned of weeds by frequent 
hoeing-, the firft and fecond time very deep, with a (harp 
pointed hoe, afterwards not fo deep, left the root fiiould be 
injured. About the time of their blooming, the earth is laid 

"Pi 



Statijlical Account 



up, fometimes in the form of a molehil-, about each flalk, 
Which is a great improvement. In this way of manage- 
ment the ground is well cleaned, and afterwards yields a 
good crop of wheat or oats. The potatoes are planted on 
light dry land, either naturally rich, or made fo with dun*. 
Lime is found hurtful, by making them grow /cabbed. In 
order to prevent their degeneracy, the feed is carefully 
picked, and fuch as grow curled leaves are kept out if pof- 
fible. Though a rotation of crops is generally obferved 
here, by railing one green and two white, yet fome of the 
farmers, diftinguifhed for Ikill in and attention to bufinefs, 
are often direded by the feafons, and the various foil of 
their lands. 

Hence the number of acres occupied by diflina fpecies 
of crops can ardly be afcertained. It is fuppofed that one 
half of the whole parilh is generally in pafture ; the other 
half in tillage ; and one-third of that laid down annually 
with grafs-feeds, the ground being always firft properly 
cleaned and prepared for them. The parilh rears a great 
deal more grain of all kinds than the inhabitants ufe, and 
the cattle bred or fattened within its bounds are not half, 
fcarcely the third part, confumed there. Upwards of 53 
ploughs are employed in the parilh, and drawn generally 
with two horfes. Oxen are alfo ufed, and found to anfwer 
the purpofes of hulbandry, both in the cart and plough. 

Population. — Veftiges of villages, malt fteeps, cottages, 
and other memorials of inhabitation in various parts of the 
parilh, indicate the population to have been formerly very 
confiderable; but no exacl lift of old date having fallen into 
my hands, the number cannot be afcertained far back. 
Agreeably to a practice recommended and generally ob- 
ferved in the Church of Scotland, the writer, upon his in- 
duction to this cure, vijfited every family within its bounds, 
I and 



of Roxburgh,

of i OjO. 

A very accurate lift was again made out at the defire of 
the Sheriff of the county, in 1782, to affift in providing 
againft a fcarcity, with which this country was then threat- 
ened, and the number of fouls was found to be 110c. 
They do not at prefent exceed 900 *, and may be diftri- 
buted thus :

Theexacl number of births and burials cannot be eafily 
afcertained. F or various reafons many childrens names are 
not regiftered ; and the people in general all over this 
country having an idea of property in their family bury- 
mg place, carry their dead there ; and by negledling to do 
fo, they feem to feel themfelves guilty, not only of viola- 
ting a natural propenfity in men to deep with their fathers, 
but alfo of infringing a facred obligation, as they fay, fane' 
tioned by the example of patriarchs, at the cave in the field 
of Macpelah. In articles of population, an account of tr/e 
ages of different clafles of perfons have been thought ex- 
pedient and ufeful. This the writer has been obliged to 
omit, except with regard to children, who neither fear nor 
blufli to tell their age ; and thofe who glory in " prattling 
" °' er the tales of other years." The children mentioned 
above are under ic years of age; of the other venerable 
clafs, there are 15 upwards of 70, nine upwards of 80, three

including collector and clerk's fees, is L. 6 : 4 : 4, levied, 
one half from the heritors, and the other half from the te-

lives, as to his circumstances. By this means improper ap- 
plications for public charity are checked ; the .truly indi- 
gent furnifhed with a good mode of obtaining relief; and 
to the generous, a plan is opened for giving alms without 
danger of impofition. It is painful, indeed, to fee parents, 
worn out with the toil and care of rearing a family, fome- 
times applying for public aid ; while the very children, 
they have nourished and brought up, will not give a mite 
to relieve their diftrefs. The public, fay they, is obliged 
to do it. This is the apology many make for neglecting 
to obey one of the firft laws of nature, while they frequent- 
ly lavifli away a considerable part of their earnings upon, 
the vanities of life. On this account fome have thought 
there mould be no law to force public charity, unlefs 
to oblige fuch as are in ability to fupport their indi- 
gent relations, especially children their parents. Alas ! if 
filial or brotherly affection cannot melt the heart, a rod of 
iron, it is to be feared, would be ufed in vain to break it.

State of the Church and School. — Five minifters have 
been ordained here lince the Revolution, viz. Meflrs Dal- 
gliefli, Brown, Pollock, Hogg, and the prefent incumbent. 
The firft of thefe was excluded from his charge at the Re- 
volution, and returned to it afterwards ; but the benefice 
being too fmall to fupport his numerous family, he was 
obliged to betake himfelf to fome other employment, and 
leave this cure, much regretted by the people. Mr Brown 
was removed from his kirk in the year 1715 ; and had it 
not been for the compamon and humanity of a Noble 
Courttefs, he had felt all the diftrefs naturally ..befalling 
fuch as are driven from a particular line of life, to which 
alone they have been educated. Though a man of no 
mining abilities, and greatly deficient in that difcernment 
and prudence neceffary to fleer the helm of conduct in a 
politic age, yet we feel for Mr Brown, retiring, in exile, to 
a remote valley, where he lived for years in a cottage on 
the fide of a rivulet, (by Cefsford), tending his milk cow, or 
delving his garden — his only livelihood, and the gift of 
charity. The ground of procefs againft Mr Brown is faid 
to have been a charge of diftoyalty, which arofe chiefly 
from his drinking the Pretender's health at Kelfo, in com- 
pany with the rebel army. This, it is faid, he did with no ill 
intention, but Amply thinking thereby to pleafe Mackintofli, 
the rebel commander, and thus recover a horfe the rebels

had ftolen from him. M?Pollock lived not long to profe- 
cute the remarkable fuccefs with which his miniftry was 
attended in this parifh. Defigned by Providence to in- 
ftrud a rude race of men, he was endowed with many qua- 
lifications requifite for that important talk. A robuft con- 
ftitution, and a bold impetuous temper ; unwearied atten- 
tion to the care of his paftoral office ; and a rigid execu- 
tion of difcipline •, a competent fhare of various erudition, 
and very confiderable powers of addrefs, procured him the 
kiting memorial of having turned many from darknefs to 
light. Scarcely above one in a family, before his days, 
having been taught to read here, under his tuition the 
youths not only obtained the elements of ufeful knowledge 
at fchool, but were obliged to commit the principles of re- 
ligion and morality,- as recommended by the constitution 
of this kingdom, carefully to memory, and repeat them 
publicly at church, which gave early and falutary ideas of 
civil and facred virtues that the lapfe of time has not en- 
tirely wiped away. His few Surviving difciples talk of 
thefe things with delight •, and difcover the mingled fenfa- 
tions of joy and trembling, while (.hey fpeak. of the great 
oaken Jlick wherewith Mr Pollock always walked, over- 
awing the infolent ; or the engaging means by which he

tive of the parifh, and wore out his days in ferving this 
cure with much efteem, refpeft, and ufefulnefs. He died 
on the 3d day of February 1781, in the 46th year of his 
miniftry, and was fucceeded by the prefent incumbent in 
the month of November following. The church was built 
in the year 1752 •, was the firft modern houfe of that kind 
in this corner of the country ; is in good repair, neat and 
commodioufly fitted up for holding the people. Though

differently 



I2 4 Statijlical Account 



differently men in ancient and modern times think of pla- 
ces fkteft for devotional exercifes. Agreeably, as it would 
leem, to the old idea, that the fpirit of devotion likes befl 
to dwell in gloomy retreats, the kirk at Roxburgh was al- 
moft Wholly under ground, roofed with a ftrong arch, and 
totally overgrown with grafs. The people entered to the 
place of public worfliip through an aifle * of the fame con- 
tfruction, and defcended by fix or feven fteps into the body 
of the church, (perhaps the particular conftrudtion of that 
edifice had been intended as a kind of fecurity to the wor- 
Ihippers in times of perfecution and danger). The manfe 
has, been rebuilt during the prefent minifter's incumbency, 
and might be deemed a good one, did not the very damp 
Situation render it both particularly uncomfortable and un- 
healthful to live in. The heritors have already been at 
confiderable expence in repairing it, by renewing the 
ground-floor, throwing drains round the houfe, &amp;c. but all 
feems, as yet, an ineffectual remedy of an evil that might 
eafily have been prevented at firft. It is furely the intereft 
as well as the duty of all who are bound by law to furnilh 
accommodations to persons in public characters, not only 
to contract with tradefmen, but alfo to fee the work done 
in a place and form that may render it molt durably com- 
forcable. The Duke of Roxburgh is the undoubted pa- 
tron of this kirk. The flipend is L. 73 : 3 : 4, including 
communion-elements, and L. 1, 10 s. Sterling in lieu of 
turf-cafting. A decreet of modification paffed the 3d day 
of March 1790, augmented faid ftipend by a grant of four 
chalders of bat- meal, but the locality is not yet fettled. 
Practices of this kind are not only very much againft a irii- 
nillcr's interdl, but often prove alfo extremely hurtful to 

heritors,

heritors, on whom the greater* lhare of ftipends finally falls. 
The law indeed authorifes a minister to uplift his whole 
modified stipend, until localled, from any proprietor, who 
has fufficient teinds within the parifh. This, however, 
though ftriaiy legal, is generally thought an ungracious 
ftep, is difficult to render effectual, and is feldom or never 
followed, unlefs neceffity urges. The glebe is of confider- 
able extent, but not including a grafs-glebe, nor has the 
minifter any thing in lieu thereof that he knows of, has 
been all inclofed and much improven at the prefent incum- 
bent's fole expence. But being naturally of a wet, cold 
bottom, and interfered by a very deftru&amp;ive rivulet, it 
will require conllant attention to keep the fences in re- 
pair, and the land in any tolerable state of culture or fruit - 
fulnefs. The minister's garden is now very good, and his 
office-houfes are fuitable, had their fituation been dry. — The 
number of fcholars attending the parochial fchool is gene- 
rally about 30 in fummer, and 40 in winter. The fchool- 
mafter's falary is L. 100 Scotch, and a darg of turf caft on 
Roxburgh moor, according to ufe and wont. Befides his 
legal falary, he has feveral little perquisites, fuch as 10 s. 
per annum as precentor and feffion-clerk ; 20 s. per annum 
as heritors clerk -, for each proclamation of banns, 1 s. ; for 
every registration of baptifm, 6d. -, and 4ld. for each te- 
ftimonial of moral character •, thefe are here given by the 
authority of the kirk-feffion . The fchool- wages are 1 s. 
per quarter for reading ; 1 s. 6 d. for writing ; and 1 s. for 
arithmetic. Befides the parochial, there are two fchools in 
this parifh, which accommodate children who live at a di- 
ftance from the village. The falary of the matters of thefe 
two fchools is given by their employers. It is much to be 
wished that country fchoolmafters had more liberal appoint- 
ments. The Duke of Roxburgh, whofe attention to all 
&amp;ich public institutions deferves the highest praife, has aug- 
mented 



126 



Statiftical Account 



mented to the legal idtimnm, viz. L. 100 Scotch, the fchool- 
mafler's falary here, and I believe of all the fchoolmafters 
where he has any concern. They are fliU but a poor in- 
ducement for men of genius or learning, in this enterpri- 
sing age, to undergo the drudgery of that moil ufeful office. 
At thefe humble feminaries, the million in this country re- 
ceive the rudiments of civil and moral character ; and the 
principles children imbibe there, often direct the whole te- 
nor of their future life. Unlefs the depravity of the world 
lias rubbed off the virtuous feelings a boy wasinfpired with 
at fchool, we frequently find him in mature age puffied on 
to excellence in laudable purfuits by the fame nerves which 
led him foremoft in the youthful fport, and made him a.- 
fpire at perfonal honour, or his mailer's applaufe, by riling 
Dux in the clafs through merit and induftry. It might, 
therefore, be of great advantage to church and ftate, in a 
land where the road to eminence is open to all who will 
Ihive to attain it, were a man of a liberal and polilhed, 
mind placed at the head of each of thefe nurferies of youth, 
qualified not only to teach children the alphabet, but to im- 
plant in their minds the feeds of virtue, and of that noble 
ambition which leads to preferment in the world, as at 
fchool, by pei-fonal worth and due fubmiffion to fuperiors. 
But this can hardly be expected, while the appointments of 
that office continue fo extremely narrow, as to make every 
well-educated and virtuous man fhrink back from it as a 
place of hopelefs penury, or follow fome other employ- 
ment befides his fchool, in order to gain a decent livelihood 
for his family. It is hoped, however, that fuch arrange- 
ments will be made as may enable prelbyteries (whom the 
wifdom of our anceftors has conlti luted guardians of paro- 
chial fchools) to recommend men every way lit for con- 
ducting that Angular fyftem of education from whence the 
Soottifli people have derived fuch confluence, and on the

proper management of which the welfare of fociety fo 
greatly depends. Over the parochial fchool of this parihY 
a man of great integrity has prefided upwards of 40 years, 
and many have reaped the good fruits of his labours. 

Heritors.— There are ten heritors, or proprietors of land, 
in the parifti, five great and five fmall. The Duke of Rox- 
. burgh is proprietor of one half of the lands in the whole 
parifti, and bears confequently one half of all parochial bur- 
dens, except the minifter's ftipend, of which by law he can 
greatly relieve himfelf, being titular of all the teinds. The 
only great heritor who refides for any length of time is the 
Hon. Baron Rutherford of Fairnington. Of this gentle- 
man's character, fo univerfally and fo juftly efteemed, a 
fmall part only falls within the limits of a Statiftical ac- 
count. The whole eftate is cultivated by the proprietor 
himfelf, and his extenfive improvements have afforded 
bread to artifts and labourers in this part of the country 
for many years. Befides their receiving the ftated price of 
labour, the moft humane and particular attention is paid 
to the comfort and health of the inhabitants ; in fo much, 
that every thing being found them, (even medical affiftance 
when neceflary), they have no need to apply to the public 
funds of the pariih for charity. In a fmall village on this 
eftate, in which there are upwards of 100 fouls, the pro- 
prietor has eftablifhed a fchool with a confiderable falary 
to a teacher properly qualified. The fchoolmafter has an 
additional allowance for keeping a Sunday fchool, where 
all who with to attend are inftru&amp;ed in the principles of re- 
ligion and morality, and proper books on thefe fubje£ts put 
into their hands. — Inoculation of the fmall pox has often 
been fuccefsfully pra&amp;ifed in the bounds of his eftate ; and 
this alfo being afforded gratis, has induced the parents to 
comply with that falutary meafure. Thus both the lpi-

ritual and temporal interefts of the people are carefully at- 
tended to by the Hon. Baron *. 

Of the 22 farmers who occupy the lands in this pariih, 
eight farm pretty extenfively, the reft are fmall tenants. 
Eleven or twelve in the village of Roxburgh are called 
cotlanders, poffeffing from his Grace the Duke of Roxburgh 
about two acres of land each, together with a houfe r yard, 
and liberty of pafturing their cows in an adjacent loaning. 
This, along with their own induftry in fome trade, enables 
them to bring up their families pretty comfortably. They 
have no leafe of their lands, but their rents are feldom rai- 
fed, and they are almoft never turned away, unlefs they be- 
have ill, or prove troublefome neighbours. All of them 
have families, which being, in general, trained up in the 
path of virtue and induftry, promife to be ufeful members 
of fociety. 

Animals. — This parifh contains about 160 work, 9 or 
10 riding horfes, and feveral young ones to preferve the 
ftock, 600 black cattle, and 4000 ftieep, all good of their 
kind, though not diftinguilhed in the neighbourhood either 
for fize or value. Birds of all kinds, ufually met with in 
this country, appear here in their proper feafons. — The 
Tweed and Teviot are the only rivers in the pariih, and 
abound with various kinds of filh, especially falmon, whofe 
prices are generally regulated by the Berwick market. A 
fmall purple-coloured trout prevails much here, very deli- 
cious to eat, and is faid to be peculiar to Teviot. Such 
quadrupeds as generally frequent the fouthern parts of 
Scotland, appear in various corners of this pariih, and af- 
ford the fportfmen plenty of game in the feafon.

Advantages and Difadvantages.— -Though this parifli is 
cot much diftinguifhed from thofe around by any particu- 
lar local advantages, yet its vicinity to a good market at 
Kelfo, its inhabitants being liable to no peculiar difeafe, 
and its very healthful climate, are properties of high efti- 
mation. Spring agues were troublefome in two or three 
places, which lie low and damp; but fince the ground 
about thefe was made dry in the courfe of farming improve- 
ment, by drains and inclofing, the inhabitants have not 
been expofed to that complaint in any remarkable degree. 
Several old people complain much of what they call the 
pains, or rheumatifm, owing probably to the extreme cold 
they are expofed to from their damp houfes,. and great 
fcarcity of firing. Among the principal difadvantages un- 
der which this place and all the neighbourhood labour, is 
the great diftance from coal, and a total want of every 
other fpecies of fuel. This is a real calamity to the poor ; 
and moft heavily felt by them fince they were, fome years 
ago, all prohibited from cafting turf on the moors. Every 
cottar ufed to have liberty from his m after to caft a darg or 
two of turf. — The fine road from Berwick to Carlifle, (fo 
beautifully defcribed in the Statiftical Account of Bedrule), 
paffes through the fouth part of this parifli, and is of exten- 
five fubflantiaJ benefit, as is that likewife which runs along 
the north iide of the parifh from Kelfo to Melrofe. But 
the high road paffing through the village of Roxburgh is 
yet in a natural ftate, and on account of its extreme rug- 
gedntfs is almoft impaffable. In confequence, however, of 
a bridge now building over Teviot, near Kelfo, we hope 
this road will foon be put into a ftate of complete repair, 
being the direft line therefrom up through a rich populous 
country, whofe comforts and improvement are much im- 
peded by the want of it. The bridge above mentioned is 
lemarkably handfome, and will be of vaft utility to all that

populous diflria between Tweed and Teviot ; efpecially 
to the tenants on the eaft end of this parim, whom the ac- 
cidental magnitude of thefe rivers often interrupted in the 
courfe of bulinefs. Another inconvenience arifes to this 
pariih from its intellection by the Teviot. The lands ad- 
jacent to the river are not indeed expofed to much damage 
thereby, and a boat is kept at Roxburgh, both for ferving 
the country, and accommodating the people with accefs to 
the church ; yet the flooding of the river often prevents a 
populous diitricl of the pariili from attending public wor- 
ihip, and totally deprives the children there of the benefit of 
the parochial fchool. As many landward parifties labour 
under fimilar inconveniencies with regard to parochial 
fchools, it is hoped that in thefe arrangements underftood 
to be going on through Scotland for better encouraging the 
education of youth, fome plan will be adopted for provi- 
ding flated fchoolm afters in fuch places as have not accefs 
to the parilh-fdiool. 

Views. — In almoft every corner of this parifh the eye is 
prefented with objects that nature and art feem vying how 
belt to adorn. The beauties of the fcenery which fur- 
rounds the feat of the ancient city of Roxburgh exceeds all 
defcription. A little to the weft of this, the public road 
lies along the top of a precipice lined with trees, through 
which a traveller perceives the Tweed rolling " dark, 
" drumbly and deep," far below him ; at a little diftance, 
on the other hand, he fees the Teviot meandring round a 
large plain, and bounded by a rocky wooded bank. While, 
contemplating thefe rivers, truly beautiful when in low 
•water, and grand when in flood, the fpeclator fuddenly 
lofes fight of them, and every thing elfe but the wood that 
overfhadoWs him in a hollow of the way. In this gloomy 
path he goes only a few paces, until a mcft enchanting 

fcene 



of Roxburgh. 



fcene opens upon him all at once, the prominent features 
whereof are, the Duke of Roxburgh's feat at Fleurs ; Sir 
George Douglas's at Springwoodpark ; the Teviot on the 
right and Tweed on the left hand, two beautiful bridges 
over thefe, and Kelfo, in all its glory, full in the traveller's 
eye, as he paffes eaftward. From a particular fpot in the 
village of Roxburgh there is a very magnificent view. 
Looking eaftward, the fpe&amp;ator fees nothing wild of uncul- 
tivated, andftretches the line of Villon along a valley, appa- 
rently covered with trees, to the diftance of 8 or 10 miles. 
A corn or grafs field, a houfe here and there, and the fmoke 
of various cots and villages curling up from amiclft the fo- 
reft, diverfify and heighten the fcene. A houfe on the top 
of a high hill, with a row of trees on each fide of it, make3 
a fine termination to' the whole. From the fame fpot the 
fpe£rator is amufed with a very different profpeft weft- 
ward, double the length, and bounded by the lofty moun- 
tain Carter, and its adjacent hills. From a riling ground 
on the fouth fide of the parifh, the curious are gratified with 
a romantic view of the Teviot. After being concealed by 
the particular arrangement of its banks, the river appears 
tumbling cafcade-like from the mouth of Sunlaws caves, and. 
inftantly difappears again. The cave-mouths, and the river 
apparently flowing from them, produce a moft. lingular ef- 
feft. A profpecl of the Teviot from Sunlaws hill, wind- 
ing through an extenfive dale, enriched in the higheft de- 
gree both by nature and art, well deferves notice as pecu- 
liarly pleafing and grand. The wideft and moft abundant 
range of view which this parifh affords, is from a riling 
ground or hill called Duns-Law, on the weft angle of Fair- 
nington eftate. Agreeably to the import of its name, this 
eminence is faid to have formerly been a ftation of autho- 
rity and ftrength. An obfervatory, or fummer-houfe, built

a profpea too vaft, and crowded with object, for particu- 
lar or critical remark. From this advantageous" fpot of 
obfervation, the various powers of tafte which adorn the 
mind of man are called forth, and pleafantlj engaged in 
contemplating lofty mountains, verdant hills, fruitful plains* 
beautiful rivers, populous towns, great woods, three re- 
nowned caftles, and a peep of the German Ocean. Under 
the fpeclator's eye from this place the parifli of Roxburgh 
lies fully difphyed, and forms an excellent landfcape, the 
Tweed wafliing its border on the north, and Teviot partly 
on the fouth. A rich, angle, all inclofed * lying on the 
fouth-eaft fide of Teviot, adds much to the beauty of the 
whole. 

Curiojities. — Among the curiofities in this parifli, two 
well-fprings, on the banks of the Tweed, of a petrifying 
quality, are remarkable. One of thefe is but a feeble 
fpring, and being in the midft of marfhy ground, is not very 
.perceptible. The mofs around it, however, is all incrufted 
coniiderably. More plentiful in its fource, the other 
fpring produces a more powerful effecT:. It feems to drip 
through a folid rock ; but upon near infpe&amp;ion, that rock 
appears plainly to be a petrified fubftance. The powers of 
the water are fo ftrong, as to cruft a bit of mofs, or any ca- 
pillary fubftance, within the fpace of three months, and 
render it hard as folid ice in- the courfe of half a year. A 
little below this a ftratum of rock (by miners called a dike) 
runs acrofs the river, and forms a great natural curiofity. 
The rock is divided into four flits, which contain the 
Tweed when not in flood. Two of thefe are about 34 feet 
deep, and fo narrow that one may eafily ftep acrofs them. 
In fummer, people a-foot ufed often to pafs the river here ; 

but

but Sir Henry Hay Macdougal, fome time ago, caufed the 
middle rock to be blown up ; and thus humanely Hopped that 
curious, but dangerous paffage. As the water runs through 
thefe gullets with great velocity, perpetually hurling down 
fmall nones, it emits a loud grumbling noife at all times; 
but at the break of an ice ftorm, it fends forth a tremen- 
dous roar like the raging fea, and is heard a great way off. 
In the time of froft the different ftiapes and hoary appear- 
ance of the ice form a grand fcene in fummer, or when 
the river is low, a diflant view excites pleafant emotions-, 
anearinfpeaion of the deep impetuous ftream raifeth a 
very different feeling. Thefe rocks are frequented by 
great numbers of falmon, and highly valued by fifhers. as. a 
fit place for fetting their nets. Three or four cart-load of 
fifh are fometimes catched there in a morning. Such fifn 
as lodge among thefe rocks a few days, it is faid, turn quite 
black," owing, perhaps, to the effect of copper ore which 
appears on both fides of the river here in confiderable 
quantity. Some of the fmall ftones which halt on thefe 
rocks being kept in a conftant eddy by the current, grind 
out deep round holes verjfoon, which make a curious 
beautiful appearance. 

Antiquities.— Such as are given to that fpecies of inve- 
ftigation might find many memorials of antiquity in this 
parifh. The feat and gardens of the Francifcan monks,

This venerable fabric has once been of great extent and 
magnificence. Old people here remember its having vari- 
ous apartments inhabited, the windows and doors fecured 
by iron bars and gates, and the lintles and door-pofts, espe-

on the ground-floor, lighted by a few rays tranfmitted 
through fome flits in the wall, apparently deiigned for air, 
or for fliooting arrows from in different direcfions. The 
apartments are ilrongly arched above ; the walls are up- 
wards of fix feet thick, and built with fmallftones, cement- 
ed firm as the folid rock. The roof is overgrown with 
grafs, interfperfed by brufti-wood, fprung, feemingly, from 
feed blown thither from a neighbouring afli-tree. Thefe 
bulhes contribute much to the beautifully grotefque figure 
of this ruin. From this tower was carried to the late Lady 
Chatto's (whofe property it was) a ftrong iron gate, two 
fpears, a fteel cap, and a coat of mail very entire. The 
fpears were of fuch lize that a rugg faw was made out of 
each, and ftill to be feen here : the coat of mail was fo 
heavy, that a ftout young man in this village, who tried it on 
and eflayed to walk, was not able to move with it. This 
ruin is called Merlin's Cave, in memory of an ancient in- 
habitant of that name, they fay. It bears alfo the name of 
Wallace's Tower; but whether it obtained that defignation, 
like fome other places in Scotland, merely in honour of 
fuch an illuftrious champion of his country ; or whether, as 
blind Harry fays, Wallace was a&amp;ually in this place, and 
built the tower at Roxburgh, the writer has not been able 
fully to afcertain. A young woman, about 70 or 80 years 
ago, fell from the flair-head, where fiie was fitting fpinning 
one day, and foan after that the place was totally deferted.

death has happened, the people imagining that fuch places 
are haunted by the ghofts of the deceafed ; that gloomy 
fancy was heightened in this inftance by the confideration 
of the poor unfortunate's being a bride the day me died. 
A little to the weft ward of this, on the oppofite fide of the 
river, appear feveral caves cut out of folid rock, in the 
middle of a high precipice, whofe bottom is waflied by the 
Teviot, which flows here broad and deep in a ferpentine 
form. Three of thefe caves have been of large dimenfions. 
One of them was ufed as a hiding place for horfes in 1745, 
when the Pretender to the Crown of Britain went through 
this parifh with his army, and from that circumftance, as 
well as from its having been ufed for a ftable afterwards. 
It is called the Horfe Cave. Another, whofe mouth is al- 
moft quite filled up, and inacceffible now, reaches fo far 
back into the ground, that old people who have been in it 
fay they never got to the fartheft end of it, and fuppole this 
cave had been a fubterraneous pafiage to Sunlaws manfion- 
houfe in times of danger. A third is called the Dove Cave, 
from its having been ufed by Lady Chatto as a pigeon- 
houfe The fides of it are full of fquare holes cut out of 
the folid rock, and faid to have been the pigeon nefts ; 
but fome imagine from this circumftance, that it had been 
originally a concealed cellar, or hiding place for (tores. It 
is probable thefe caves had all been ftieltering holds during 
the border incurlions, which expofed the miserable inhabi- 
tants of this country to perpetual danger and depredation. 
At the mouth of one of thefe caves, in a fine fummer even- 
ing, when the fun has gone " haljlings down the weft," the 
eye is prefented with a view of nature difplayed in fuch 
glory and variety, as fhe feldom aftumes. Many veftiges

veral ftreams iflues out of it, which, from the name f, the 
peculiar falubrity of the water, and the remains of nice 
building, had likely been once of great repute. The great 
Roman road (Watling-ftreet) by Borrowbridge, runs 
through the weft corner of this parifli; and that being

their wonted character of fobriety, kindnefs, liberality, and

inhabitants of Roxburgh parifli lie under peculiar obliga-

ABERDEEN, the metropolis of the northern divifion of 
Scotland, and the capital of the county of Aberdeen, 
is fituared at the influx of the rivers Bon and Dee into the 
German Ocean ; and in 57 0 9' north latitude, as taken at

" and New Aberdeen, with the adjacent country between the rivers Dee 
" and Don." It makes a fingle meet map, and is prefixed to No. III. of 
Bibliotheca Typographica Britannica, 4to. The fecond, publiflied in 1773, 
by Captain Taylor, comprehends Old Aberdeen, and moft of the parifli of 
Old Machar, with all the fields lying between Dee and Don, to about three 
miles from the mouth. The third, on a larger fcale than either of the for- 
mer, publiflied in 1790, by Alexander Milne, is intended chiefly as a map 
of the town and harbour of Aberdeen, with the neareft circumjacent fields. 



of Aberdeen* 



141 



The etymology of Aberdeen, the ancient as well as mo- 
dern name both of the town and parifh, is doubtlefs from 
the ancient Britifh. Aber, according to Cambden, when ap- 
plied to a river or brook, fignifies the mouth, ojiium, the 
place where it falls into the fea, or into any lake or river. 
The earlieft mention, probably, of this place, is in a Roman 
itinerary of the incurfion made by Severus, if we miftake 
not, into the northern parts of the ifland, in the beginning 
of the 3d century. The town is there called Devana, and 
the river Leva. But whether the name Devana was ufed 
by the natives may reafonably be queftioned. It appears 
more likely to have been given it by the Romans from its 
fituation on Deva, the Dee. What ferves to confirm this 
opinion is, that the Dee, a river of the fame name in the 
weft of England, is, .by Ptolemy, alfo called Deva, and 
Cbejlerj the only city of note upon it, is, from that circum- 
ftance, called Devana, a Word which has no affinity to 
Chejler, or to any name by which it feems to have been 
known to the natives. Probably, therefore, Aberdeen is 
the firft name by which this town was diftinguifhed, and 
that before the introduction of Chriftianity into the country. 
It is much more probably derived from the ancient Britijh 
than from the Erfe. To the former, the oldefl names of 
towns, rivers, and mountains in this country have a greater 
affinity than to the latter, which, though but a different 
dialed of the fame language, the Celtic came much later 
than the other into the eaftern parts of the country, from a 
colony of Irijh, whence it has had, time immemorial, the 
name of Erfe. If the Pi£b were, as fome of our antiqua- 
ries iuppofe, a tribe of the ancient Britons, the name is 
doubtlefs to be afcribed to them. But if, as is maintained 
by others, the Pifts were originally Scandinavians or Ger- 
mans, the name Aberdeen, with many others, mufr have had 
its origin before their invafion, and muft be attributed to 

the 



J 4 2 Statijlical Accowit 

Op 

the firft known inhabitants of the whole ifland, the ancient 
Britons. Another argument that it is from the old Britijh 
or Welch, not from the Irijh or Erfe, that Aberdeen is de- 
rived, is, that in no place where the Erfe has been, time 
immemorial, the vernacular tongue, do we find any name 
of fimilar derivation ; whereas We find many in thefe parts 
where the other language was known to have prevailed. 
In Scotland, for example, all the Abers are on the eaft fide. 
There we have Aberdeen, Aberdour, Aberbrothock, Aber- 
lemny, Abernethy. In Wales they abound— Aberavon, 
Aberconway, Aberfraw, Abergely, Abergerlick, and Aber- 
yftwith. In the neighbouring weftern parts of England— 
Aberford and Abergaveny. But not any that we know 
in the eaftern parts of England, none in Ireland, nor on the 
weft of Scotland, the country of the Highlanders, where the 
Erfe has been the language of the people for many ages. 
It may feem ftrange that there fhould be no example of 
this Britifh idiom on the eaft coaft of England, of which 
the Britons were fo long in poffeflion. We know no way 
this can be accounted for, but by pbferving, that when the 
country was fubdued by the Saxons, the old inhabitants, 
were not, as is common, fufFcred to remain and intermingle 
with the conquerors, but were cruelly expelled, and forced 
to take refuge in the, mountains of the weft, a tracT of 
country comparatively barren, and almoft inacceflible. It 
is this total and fudden extermination, by which alone we 
can account for fo ftrange a facl, that few places in the 
eaftern parts of England retain their old Britifh names. 
That the ancient Britons, and the Irifti or Scots (for the 
name Scoti was for ages ufed indifferently of both) were 
originally and equally Gaulifti colonies, there is no room to 
doubt ; but as they have come off at different times, and 
probably from diftant parts of the extenfive countries peo- 
pled by the Gauls, the dialers of thefe different colonies, 

though 



of Aberdeen. 



143 



though refembling, as fprung from a common ftock, are not 
fo far coincident as that the tongue of the one nation mould 
be intelligible to the other. That our Scotch Highlanders 
are originally from Gaul is manifeft from the name Gaelic 
which they have always given to the language they fpeak. 
This is not lefs evident of the ancient Britons, from the 
name univerfally given to the country, to which, after the 
Anglo-Saxon conqueft, they were obliged to confine them- 
felves. It was called Gallia, which in the Saxon idiom is 
Wales; the people Galli, Welchmen. For let it be obfer- 
ved, that thofe who fpoke any of the Teutonic dialecls al- 
ways changed the hard g of the fouthern languages into w. 
Thus, of the French guerre they made war; from their 
guardien, we have warden; their Guillamme'is our William; 
and Gualtere is Walter. And converfely, he who is ill 
Britain Prince of Wales, is in France le Prince de Galles. 
To fay, therefore, that one fpeaks Weljh, muft have denoted 
the fame originally as he fpeaks Gaulijh, or Gaelic, no 
other alteration being made on the word than what the 
adapting of it to the Saxon pronounciation rendered necef- 
fary. It is, therefore, no improvement in moderns to con- 
found with it the dialed of the Highlanders, by giving it 
the name Gaelic ; for though this application may be jufti- 
fied from confidering the origin of the people, yet as the 
more familiar name Erfe ferves both to difcriminate the 
dialed of our Highlanders from the ancient Britifh, and to 
point out its coincidence with the Irifli, it is every way 
preferable. It is not meant to intimate, that thofe names 
which have commonly been confidered as of Irifh extrac- 
tion, are all originally Britifh. Some of them are mani- 
feftly of the former dialed. In Erfe, the word imer, for 
example, correfponds to the Britifli aber. Now we have 
feveral znvers, as Invernefs, Inverury, Inverbervy, all un- 
nueftionably from the Erfe •, only with regard to thefe, we

have reafon to think they are of much later origin than the 
other. Strut, or Strath, in Britifh, denoting a valley en- 
clofed by hills, and lying along the banks of a river or lake. 
Hence Stratbearn, Stratbmore, Strathdon, Strathfpej, &amp;c. 
Nearly equivalent to Strath is Glen in Erfe, and Dale in 
Anglo-Saxon. Thus, what with us is Clydefdale, was by 
the ancient inhabitants called Strut clyde. 

This place is frequently known by the name of the Old 
and New Town of Aberdeen; the former is chiefly fitua- 
ted near the mouth of the Don, the latter near the mouth 
of the Dee. The two rivers, at their influx into the fea, 
are diftant about a mile and a quarter ; but this intervening 
fpace is moflly occupied by regular ftreets and buildings, 
which form the prefent city of Aberdeen. 



<name ref="NA">OLD MACHAR</name>. 

The parifh of jOld Machar was originally a deanry, 
called the Deanry of St Machar, and comprehended the 
parifhes of Old Machar, New Machar, and Newhills. In 
times of Popery, they do not feem to have been divided 
into feparate parifhes, but to have been chapels in the dean- 
ry, at which chapels divine worfhip was regularly perform- 
ed, as the inhabitants of fo extenfive and populous a diftrict 
could not conveniently meet in one place for public worftiip. 
New Machar feems to have been erected into a feparate 
parifti about the time of the Reformation; and Newhills

about the year 1663. This parifh is now called Old Aber- 
deen, or the Old Town parifh, from the city of Old Aber- 
deen, in which the cathedral, now the parifh -church, is 
fkuated.

The extent of this parifh is great, and its form irre- 
gular. Its fouth-eaft corner forms the north and weft 
boundaries of the city of Aberdeen, or parifh of St Nicho- 
las. It extends about three miles up the Dee, by which 
river it is bounded on the fouth, and divided from the pa- 
rifh of Nigg, and county of Kincardine. The weftern 
boundary ftretches in a crooked line from the Dee to the 
Don, at the diftance of about two miles an ! a half from 
the parilh- church. By this line it is divided from the 
parifhes of Nether Banchory and Newhills. Crofting the 
Don, it extends a mile and a half farther up the river, ma- 
king in all four miles from the river's moUth. On this 
part, the Don divides it from the parifhes of Newhills and 
Dyce ; its northern boundary pafles by the parifhes of 
New Machar and Belhelvie, till it joins the fea at the 
Black Dog *, forming a fweep, every part of which is di- 
ftant from the parifh-church at leaft four miles. On the 
eafl it is bounded by the fea from the Black Dog to Aber- 
deen, the extent of coaft being about five miles. Its great- 
eft length from north to fouth may be from feven to eight 
miles, and its greateft breadth about four miles. 

This parifh rifes in a gentle flope from the fea, and though 
there is no eminence in it that defefves the name of a moun- 
tain, its furface is beautifully diverfified by riling grounds. 
The windings of the Dee and the Don, the manufactories, 
and the woods on the banks of the latter, fome detached

and New Aberdeen, and the villages of Gilcomfton an£ 
Hardgate, give a pleafant variety to the general appearance 
of this pariih. The fteep and rugged banks of the Don, 
from the houfe of Seaton till below the bridge, are fo truly 
romantic, that they feldom efcape the granger's notice. 
Thefe rocks, abounding with an irnmenfe variety of herbs, 
covered partly with wood, and partly with furze, afford 
ample gratification both to the botanift and the lover of ru- 
ral beauty. Winding in a femicircular form, as you walk 
along their fummits, you command in one direction, con- 
ftantly varying, views of the fea, and of the old lofty 
Gothic arch which is thrown over the river ; while, onths^ 
oppofite direction, you have as diverfified views of the old 
Cathedral, the fpires of Aberdeen, and the various manu- 
factories on the different meanders of the Don. Thefe 
profpe&amp;s, if you look down, are delightfully varied, by tha 
fifhermen plying their little boats, at the depth of 50 or 60 
feet below. This place has been compared to the beauti- 
ful and wild fcenery in Switzerland. 

On the fouth fide of the parifh, near to Ferryhills, are 
many curious 1 ttle Sandhills, lying in all different direc- 
tions, and moulded into various forms, feemingly by. the 
retiring of fome irnmenfe quantity of water. Among 
thefe one called the round O delerves to be particularly no- 
ticed. It rifes by itfelf in a circular form, from the level 
of a mofs, and has a hollow in it of confiderable depth, like 
an inverted fugar-loaf. This hollow is marfhy in the bot- 
tom. As to its caufe I have heard no conjecture. Abou; 
this place are feveral beautiful villas ; and it affords excel- 
lent fituations for many more. 

The foil in this parifh is in fome places naturally fertile, 
in others barren; and many parts of it have been forced 
into fertility by aftonifhing labour and expence. Where 
it has not been meliorated by art, it is in general fhallow,

fcndy, and full of flones. To this, fome fpots on the mar- 
gin of the Don, and the fields from the eaft fide of the city 
of Old Aberdeen to the fea, form exceptions ; although the 
foil of thefe laft be light, it has for a fubfoil a very deep 
ftratum of excellent clay. In many places to the north of 
the Don, efpecially towards the coaft, a deep mofs of an in- 
different quality is found under the foil ; and in fome places 
immenfe beds of fand. 

The air is generally healthy: and like that of other 
places on the coaft, is neither fo hot in fummer, nor fo cold 
in winter, as in more inland parts of the country. 



<name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6415558">ABERDEEN, or St NICHOLAS</name>. 

The parifh is fometimes called the parifh of St Nicholas, 
the tutelar faint, to whom the great church in the city, 
which was very ancient, but of whofe age we have no re- 
cord, had been dedicated. The church was pulled down 
and rebuilt about the middle of the prefent century, but 
Hill retains the name of St Nicholas from the former dedi- 
cation. As to the origin of this name, it is requifite only 
to obferve, that though there have been in the church many 
Doftors named Nicholas, the Bifhop of Myra in Lycia is 
the only one of the name who has obtained a place in the 
Kalendar, and is therefore to be accounted the tutelar 
faint intended. The name St Nicholas, as given to the 
parifli, cannot be fuppofed to have been from the begin- 
ning. We even fufpeft the faint is younger than the pa- 
rifti. Probably this appellation is no older than the late 
edifice that bore the name. In primitive times it would 

have

have been thought a fpecies of idolatry, to dedicate a church 
to any but God. The origin of this name, therefore, as a 
name of the church or parifh, may not implausibly be at- 
tributed to fome of the dark ages, the tenth, eleventh, or 
twelfth century. 

The extent of the parifli, in point of territory, is not 
great, being confined tp the bounds of the city on every 
fide, except th fi fouth-eaft, where it extends to the mouth 
of the river, and includes a fmall fiftiing village called Fut- 
tie, (or Footdee, as fome of late afFed to fpell it from a mi- 
ftaken etymology), which lies along the river, between 
Aberdeen and the fea, and is the only village in the parifh. 
In other dire&amp;ions, even what may be called the fuburbs 
of the town, are not in the parifli.— As to the form, though 
very irregular, it comes nearer a triangular figure than any 
other we can think of. In this view we reckon the quay, 
and that part of the ftreet which leads from the weft end 
of the quay to the Bow-bridge, (which is the loweft and 
moft foutherly part of the town), the bafe of the triangle : 
the angle fubtended, which makes the top of the triangle, 
and is the higheft part of the town, is at the Gallowgate- 
port, which is in like manner the northern extremity. — The 
length of the pari ft), nckoning from the loweft dwelling- 
houfe upon the Dee, next the block houfe, to the moft 
northern houfe in Caufey-end, is about two Englilh miles. 
The bread'h, reckoning from Sommer's houfe eaftward, 
behind North-ftreet, to the Infirmary, which is in the moft 
weftern part of the town, about one mile. — It is bounded 
on the fouth by the parifh of Nigg, from which it is fepa- 
rated by the river; the only boundary on the eaft is the 
fea ; on the north and w;e^ft, quite round from the fea to the 
river, it is bounded by the parifh of Old Machar, or Old- 
town parifh, as it is here commonly called. — The circum- 
jacent country is hilly, but not mountainous ; end though

jt abounds in ftone-quarries, there are no projecting rocks of 
any magnitude. The town itfelf, which is about a mile 
from the fea, ftands moftly on four little hills, gently riling 
from the river, to wit, Caftlehill, St Catharine's hill, Port- 
hill, and Schoolhill. 

The ground weft ward rifes, for a confiderable way, by a 
very fenfible, though eafy afcent. A great part of the 
Grampian mountains is in view. They run acrofs the 
whole country, their direftion being from north-eaft to 
fouth weft. . The Tulloe-hill, on the fouth fide of the river, 
in the parifh of Nigg, may juftly be confidered as the ter- 
mination of that traft of mountains on the eaft towards the 
German ocean. This hill is covered with Ihort heath and 
loofe ftones •, and has on it an eminence called the Kairn of 
Loarjione, which fronts the town on the fouth. The high- 
er and more diftant Grampians, on fome of which are huge 
rocks, are chiefly covered with heath and moftes. The 
Stocket, or high ground weft of Aberdeen, already men- 
tioned, was, not many years ago, covered with ftones and 
heath, but is now converted into rich fields of grafs and 
corn. 

The foil, in this neighbourhood, is naturally rather bar- 
ren and thin, being moftly gravel and fand ; but by means 
of the manure conftantly furnifhed by fo populous a city, 
is rendered, in a confiderable degree, both deep and fertile. 
Some places abound in clay, and in others there is plenty 
of black earth. — The air is commonly lharp, dry, and 
healthy, as may reasonably be expedted from the expofure 
and fituation of the town. The wind, from whatever quar- 
ter it blows, has a free circulation. There is not, however, 
in this refpeft, a perfect equality in all parts of the town. 
In thofe on the eaft fide, which are moft expofed to the fea 
air, there is greater dampnefs, and a flower vegetation in 
the gardens.

Statijlical Account 



There is a fteel mineral water on the weft fide of the 
town, near the Infirmary, commonly called the Well of Spa 
not fo ftrong as the Peterhead water, which has been thought 
of fervice in thofe cafes wherein recourfe is had to chaly- 
beate fprings. An efiay on the virtues of this water was 
pubhlhed by Dr Barclay, about the beginning of the laft 
century. A mineral fpring in the grounds of Mr Moir of 
Scotftown, in the pariih of Old Machar, was, fome years 
ago, much frequented by the lower claffes of people, partly 
for health and partly for amufemenf ; but it was filled up 
by the proprietor, in the courfe of improving his lands. 
One has, by the tenant, been opened up in the neighbour- 
hood, and feveral people drink the water, although it is not 
thought to be fo good as the former. There is another mi- 
neral well near Gordon's mills. Both are weak chalybeats, 
and may be of fome fervice in all cafes, in which a weak 
folution of iron with fixed air can do good. 

There are no lakes in the parifti. That commonly call- 
ed the Loch, lying weft of the Gallowgate, is no other than 
a mill-dam, where the water of a brook is collected and 
confined for the ufe of a malt and flour mill in the town. 
One or two fmall lochs, on the weft fide of the city of Old 
Aberdeen, have been completely drained, and now produce 
excellent crops of grain. A rivulet, called the Denburn, 
divides, for a ftiort way, this parifli from Old Machar, on 
the fouth-weft, and falls into the river Dee, a little above 
the quay. 

The river Don is navigable to the bridge, but has no 
harbour. It is navigated by one fmall floop, which is em- 
ployed in bringing coals to the brick-kilns that are near 
the water-mouth. Ia a little time there will certainly be 
more. Boats of a very large fize might eafily, at full tide, 
be brought nearly as far as Seaton houfe. This circum- 
flance would be of great importance were there any ma- 
nufactories 



tf Aberdeen. 



nufaclories at Kethock's mills, on the eftatc of Frazerfield, 
which is oppolite to Seaton, and where there is an excellent 
haugh, with a command of water fufficient for driving ma- 
chinery to any extent. Goods might be eafily exported 
direaiy from the manufaftory, and materials imported to 
it, without the trouble and expence of land carriage. 

The Dee, which abounds with excellent falmon and trout, 
is navigable for mips, fo far up only as the harbour of 
Aberdeen, into which (hips of about 200 tons burden, if of 
a proper conftrudlion, or vefiels of io feet draught (as it is 
called) can come, at high water, to the upper quay : and 
this only fince building the north pier, for before that time 
the river was not only much fhallower at the mouth than 
at prefent, but after a ftorm from the eaft or north-eaft, was 
liable to be blown up with fand, which formed a bar at the 
depth of little more than three feet from the furface, and 
proved a great ohftruclion to the entrance of large vefll Is. 
The water is, by means of the north pier, not- only con- 
fined and deepened to 18 feet and upwards, but the harbour 
Iheltered, in a great meafure, from the ftorm. — Btlow the 
town's quay are two harbours, one on the north, and the 
other on the fouth fide of the river, to both of which mips 
of much larger burden than thofe already mentioned have 
accefs ; the one on the fouth fide is the harbour of Tory, a 
filhing-town in the parifli of Nigg. 

Whether the river could be rendered navigable farther 
up than Aberdeen is not certain ; and it is probable that 
any attempt to this purpofe would anfwer no good end. 
The tide feldom or never flows higher up than to the 
bridge, which is little more than two miles from the 
mouth ; and there is not commonly fuch a quantity of wa- 
ter in the river, as, without the aid of the tide, would ferve 
lor any ufeful navigation, efpecially as there is no town or 
village, except Aberdeen, on the river.

The greateft flood in the Dee, within the memory oi 
man, was in the year 1768. But although the river rofe 
to an amazing height, it did not reach any of the houfes, 
even in the ftreet called the Green, which is the loweft and 
only part of the town that appears to be in any danger 
from inundations or land -floods. But the haughs on both 
fides of Don and Dee are fubjeft to them, and have fome- 
times fufFered confiderably. 

Bridges of Hon and Dee. 
In 1281, Henry Cheyne (nephew of John Comyn, who 
was killed by Robert Bruce at Dumfries in 1305) f UC - 
ceeded to the biflioprick of Aberdeen. After Comyn's 
death, Bifliop Cheyne, (from his being fo near a relation to 
Comyn), as well as many others in Scotland, were greatly 
enraged at Robert Bruce, upon account of Comyn's death, 
and openly efpoufed the intereft. and party of the Comyns. 
For this reafon, after Bruce became fettled in the throne 
and government, Bifliop Cheyne was obliged to fly into 
England, and remain there for feveral years, during which 
time the revenues of this biflioprick remained unapplied. 
But King Robert having been afterwards reconciled to Bi- 
fliop Cheyne, was pleafed to allow him to return, and pof- 
fefs the f^e of Aberdeen as formerly. The bifliop was fo 
na PPy upon his being again received into the King's fa- 
vour, that, upon his return home, he, with the concur- 
rence and approbation of his Sovereign, applied the whole 
rents of his biflioprick, which, during his abfence in Eng- 
land, had accumulated to a confiderable fum towards build- 
ing the bridge over Don of one large Gothic arch, where 
it now ftands, upon the great high road leading northward 
from Aberdeen, and it appears to have been built about the 
year 1320. Biihop Cheyne died in 1329.

Bifhop William Elphingfton left a confiderable legacy to 
-build a bridge over the river Dee, near Aberdeen, as well 
as for the erection of an univerfity at Old Aberdeen, where 
the bifhop's cathedral flood, but died in 15 14, before any 
thing was done in the building of the bridge. Gnvin Dun- 
bar, fon of Sir James Dunbar of Cumnock, by Elizabeth 
daughter of the Earl of Sutherland, and uncle to Gavin 
Dunbar, Archbifhop of Glafgow, having fueceeded to the 
bifhoprick of Aberdeen in 1518, he foon thereafter caufed 
colled and receive the money which had been left by Bi- 
fhop Elphingfton for the building of this bridge ; and ha- 
ving alfo contributed himfelf a confiderable fum of money 
to that work, he caufed ereft the greateft part of the bridge 
where it now Hands, of feven arches, about the year 1530, 
although it was not finifhed till after his death. This 
bridge having gone into decay about the year 1720, was 
rebuilt out of the funds belonging to itfelf by the Magi- 
ftrates and Town-council of Aberdeen, from 1720 to 1724, 
and is, at this day, one of the neatefl of any in Scotland. 

Harbour. 

The extent of fea-coaft in the parifhes of Old Machar 
and St Nicholas is about fix miles, and is commonly known 
by the name of the Bay of Aberdeen. The fhore js flat 
and fandy. The harbour at the mouth of the river Dee 
was, till of late, always very much interrupted, and fome- 
times almoft entirely Ihut up by a bar, or large bank of 
fand, upon which, at low tide, there was fometimes not 
above 18 inches or two feet of water, and at the higheft 
tides not more than 13 feet. As this bar was frequently 
flnfting its fituation and varying its form, according as it 
was afted upon by ftorms from the fea, or floods from the 
river, few fhipping were in fafety to take the harbour, un- 
til firft it was founded by a pilot, and the fituation of the

bar, as well as the depth of the water, afcertalned. Thefe 1 
obftacles have in a great meafure been removed by the e- 
redi.ui of a new pier, executed according to a plan fur- 
nifhed by John Smeaton, Efq; engineer. It extends in 
length 1200 feet along the north fide of the river, and a 
confidcrable way into the fea. It was begun to be built in 
June 1775, and 

was finifhed in October 1780. Since which 
time, however, it has received fouie additions, by the ad- 
vice and direction of Mr Smeaton ; particularly a jetty 
for meltering the fhipping within the harbour, from the 
violent inrun of the fea, in ftrong eafterly winds. The cod 
of the whole amounted to about L. 18,000 Sterling. This 
expence has been defrayed, partly by fome fmall funds 
formerly belonging to the harbour, but chiefly will be paid 
by doubling the flbore and habour dues upon the trade and 
fhipping of the place, in conference of an acl of Parlia- 
ment obtained for that purpofe ; but without any public 
aid or contribution whatever. 

By the erection of this pier, although it is 200 feet Ihorter 
than in Mr Smeaton's original plan, the navigation channel 
at the entry of the harbour has been deepened and impro- 
ved to a degree much beyond any thing that was previouf- 
ly expected. Now, fmall veffels, drawing 7 or 8 feet, can 
come into the harbour at low water; and at high water, or 
fpring tides, there is from 18 to 21 feet at the entry, as the 
above mentioned bar, or bank, of fan d, is now, by the con- 
finement of the river, and the increafed velocity of the cur- 
rent, carried out into the fea, at leafl a quarter of a mile 
farther than it formerly was ; fo that we now fee veffels of 
confiderable burden, in the violence of a ftorm blowing 
right upon the land, failing with fafety into the harbour, 
even without the affifiancc of any pilot, which no fliip 
could have attempted before, without the greateft danger 
of being w/epked on the bar, or fome part of the adjacent

erefted zftgnaljlaff, on which, when there is 9 feet water 
on the bar, will be hoifted, in the day time, a pUfttredJkig, 
and in the night a lighted lamp and a rejl Bor. They will 
continue hoifted till high water.— Veffels will have the 
harbour open when the light, or flagftaff bears W. and by 
S. in which direction they will fteer clear of the Shortnefs. 
The beft anchoring ground in Aberdeen Bay is in fix or 
feven fathoms water, with the two town's fteeples in one, 
or the light bearing S. W. by W. f W.—In times of great 
land floods, or in any other circumftance which would make 
it dangerous to approach the harbour, neither the flag nor 
light will be hoifted. 

Natural ProduBions. 
This place affords few examples of uncommon quadru- 
peds, birds, or fifties. The fwallow and martin make their 
appearance about the end of April, and difappear before 
the equinox. Moft of the fowls that commonly frequent a 
low fandy fea-coaft in the northern parts of the ifland, as 
gulls, fea fwallows, fand larks, herons, cormorants, 8tc. 
are found here. 

A confiderable variety of fifh are caught in the vicinity 
of this place, as haddock, whiting, cod, ling, turbot, Ikate, 
flounders of different kinds, halibut, plaife, foal, mackerel, 
dog-fiCh, and occafionally herrings. The fifhermen of Foot- 
dee and Torrie collect, at low water, great quantities of 
fand-eels, on the fliore about the mouth of the Don •, thefe 
are ufed as bait. Some excellent fhrimps are got with 
drag-nets in the fmall lakes or holes which the tide leaves 
in the fand ; they are fold for about 8 d. the pint Scotch. 
The market is well fupplied with fifh upon very reafonable 
terms. This is a great relief to the poor, as lifh makes a 
principal part of their food. The nature of the coaft pre-

vents fea-ware from growing upon it in abundance. The 
quantitj of this marine produdion that may be driven to 
land by fe vere ftorms is not fo great, or of fo good a quality, 
as to be very ferviceable either for manure or the manu- 
iacture of kelp. 

As the parifh contains little arable ground but what is 
occup le d in gardens, and thefe moftly for the fupply of the 
market, few things refpeding agriculture, or the vegetable 
fyftem, are worthy of remark. The gardens have long 
abounded with common pot herbs, as cabbages, carrots, 
turnips, fpinage, cucumbers, Sec. The fruits here are moil- 
ly of common and hardy kinds. It has been found by re- 
peated trials, that the more delicate kinds, as the vine, 
peach, nectarine, &amp;c. do not in general fucceed. Small 
fruit, as goofeberries, currants, and rafps, agree well with 
the climate. The fame may be faid of the moft. of flowers, 
both indigenous and exotic, that are cultivated for orna- 
ment in gardens in the north of Scotland. The gean and 
roddan (mountain am) are here in abundance and perfect 
tion. But the varieties of barren timber are neither very 
numerous nor plenty. They chiefly confift of am, elm, 
beach, maple, birch, lime, willow, and holly, planted in 
hedge rows round inclofures. Gardeners have, for fome 
time part, found their account in laying out a confiderable 
proportion of their ground in nurferies of foreft-trees, as 
oak, elm, pine, Scotch fir, larch, laburnum, and many 
others, with which they fupply not only this country, but 
fend annually many thoufands of their plants to England, 
where they can afford to underfell the Englifh gardeners. 
It is obferved by old people in this place, that notwith- 
standing the great rife of the price of provifions, and of the 
rent of land, the difference of the prices of all the moft ne- 
ceflary pot-herbs and roots is, as far as their memory reach- 
es, but inconliderable. By this obfervation it would ap-

pear, that great improvements have been made here in the 
art of gardening. In the few fields within the limits of 
the parilh are fown oats, bear, or big, rarely wheat, rye, 
peafe or beans ; which, from the general difufe at prefent, it 
may 'be concluded that their culture here has not anfwered 
expedition. Flax is fometimes tried with fuccefs ; clover 
and rye-grafs are frequently fown j and fome fmall fpots of 
ground have been laid down with faintfoin and lucerne, by 
way of experiment. 

In the parilh of Old Machar are two limeftone-quar- 
ries, one at Silverburn, and another about a mile north 
from it on the Old Meldrum road. Neither of them have 
been wrought to any great extent. Nine men will, in ten 
days, quarry and break ftones to fill and fire the kiln at Sil- 
verburn. Each kiln will require 13 bolls Englim coals, 
or 18 bolls Scotch coals under duty. The average pro- 
duce of a kiln is between 150 and ^80 bolls of flacked 
lime, water meafure. Each boll of ihells will yield one 
and a half boll of powdered lime. Such ftones as are not 
burnt are thrown into the next kiln. The quarry at the 
other kiln is in all refpe&amp;s fo fimilar to this, that the fame 
remarks may, with fufficient accuracy, be applied to both. 
The limeftone of thefe quarries is not rich ; it 'does not 
fwell much in burning, and it has in it a conliderable pro- 
portion of fand j it anfwers well in building, but is not fo 
good for manure, efpecially in fandy foil like ours. The 
tackfman of thefe quarries deiilted for fome time from 
working them on account of the rife on labourer's wages, 
and the high price of coals. Since the tax on coals was 
taken off, he has again opened them ; and when his leafe 
expires, which will be foon, they will probably be wrought 
to a greater extent than formerly. 

Granite abounds in the parilh.. There are excellent quar- 
ries of it at Rubiflaw, Loanhead, Pitmuxton, and other

polis, that a ftreet paved with them, will in a few years be 
fo broken as to require great quantities of new pave- 
ment. Some houfes in and about London have alfo been 
built of Aberdeen granite. Our granite is much harder to 
work than freeftone, and is capable by much labour of re 
cemng a very fine polilh. It is generally of a grey colour 
and is mixed with mining talky particles, which give it' 
when well dreffed, a confiderable degree of luftre. About 
12,000 tons of ftone are annually exported from Aberdeen 
and are valued at 14 s. per ton, amounting to L.8400' 
Sometimes, however, the exportation is confidently greater 
Behdes the granite, our land abounds with a coarfe hard 
ftone, which, though it may be broken by the hammer 
cannot be wrought by the pick or the chifTel, and is there- 
fore little ufed in building. Colleded in immenfe quanti- 
ties from the barren fields, which are trenched or drained in 
the courfe of improving the land, it is chiefly employed in 
filling the drains, or in raifing dry ftone fences for inclofing 
and fubdividing thefe fields. Sometimes the quantities of 
thefe whinftones (as they are called) are fo great, that 
they cannot be exhaufted by fencing or draining. In thefe 
cafes they are collected in Cairns, or the fences are made 
immoderately thick. In fome grounds they are fo nume-

improvement, even by planting. Thefe obfervations arc 
not appropriated to this place only, but will too generally 
apply to many places all over the county of Aberdeen, and 
the northern part of the Mearns. 

No mines have as yet been found in this place. We 
have no coals but what are imported from England and 
the frith of Forth. Lately an ore, feemingly rich, has been 
found at the haugh of Grandhome, in digging a lead for 
bringing in water to a manufactory about to be eftablilhed 
there. The ore has been fmelted, and turns out to be 
manganefe, equal, if not fuperior in quality to any imported 
from England. There are feveral veins of it ; one of 
them about four inches thick, and all of them pafling ob- 
liquely between layers of hard and folid rock. John Paton 
of Grandhome is proprietor of the field in which it is 
found. 



CITY OF ABERDEEN. 

All hiftorical accounts agree, that this city was ereded 
into a royal burgh towards the end of the ninth century 
by King Gregory of Scotland, furnamed The Great. But 
the original charter of erection, and all the more ancient 
title-deeds and records of the burgh were, together with 
the town itfelf, burnt and deftroyed by the Englifh, as after 
noticed ; a very few charters, and other grants, however, 
have been faved, the oldeft of which is a charter by King 
William the Lion in favour of the burgefl'es of Aberdeen, 

and

and others benorth the Month*. This charter was granted 
at Perth, there called Pert, but without any date or year, 
though it muft have been towards the end of the twelfth 
century, as that King began to reign in 1165. 

There are other two charters granted by the fame King 
William to the burgeffes of Aberdeen, of the toll of their 
chatties through the whole kingdom, both dated at Aber- 
deen the 28th Auguft, without mentioning the year of God 
or of the King's reign, although, from the writing and feals, 
they appear to be of a later date than the former, and have 
probably been granted during the King's refidence here, as 
he certainly built a palace and remained fome time with his 
Court at Aberdeen. It flood upon the fite of the prefent 
Trinity Church and Trades Hofpital in the Shiprow; and 
upon King William's leaving the country, he founded in 
the fame place a monaftery for the Trinity or Red Friars, 
which was burnt and deftroyed along with the town. It 
was afterwards rebuilt about the year 1633, by Dr Wil- 
liam Guild, minifter in Aberdeen, who bequeathed and 
left it for an hofpital to decayed tradefmen, befides fome 
other fubjefts for burfaries at the Marifchal College, under 
the patronage of the Convener-court. 

About 1306-7, (according to Hector Boece), the citi- 
zens of Aberdeen, who had always fteadily adhered to and

the fame time laid the cafile in ruins, to prevent the Eng- 
lifh from returning. A party of the Englifh, who hap- 
pened to be in the neighbourhood, came immediately to 
revenge the difafter ; but they were met and engaged by 
the Aberdonians and their aflociates, in the church-yard of 
St Nicholas, where the Englifh were totally defeated, with 
great fl.aughter. 

The firft charter now extant, in favour of the burgh it- 
felf, is granted by King Robert Bruce, anno 1320, which 
contains alfo a gift and conveyance to the community of 
the Royal Foreft of the Stocket. Befides this, he granted 
various other privileges and immunities to the citizens and 
burgh of Aberdeen, fundry of which are ftill extant, from 
1314 to 1324. 

In 1333, Edward III. of England having fent a fleet of 
mips to ravage the eaft coaft of Scotland, a body of Englifh. 
landed, and by furprife, attacked the town of Aberdeen, in 
the night time, killed a great number of the inhabitants, 
and burnt and deftroyed the town for fix days together, in 
revenge for the feveral defeats which their countrymen had 
there received. 

Anno 1336, Edward III. invaded Scotland, and marched 
with an army as far north as Invernefs, during which time 
the citizens of Aberdeen went out and attacked a party of 
Englifh forces, who had landed at Dunnoter, and killed 
their general* In revenge of which, Edward, upon his re- 
turn from Invernefs, made a violent attack upon the town 
of Aberdeen, put the greateft part of the inhabitants to the 
fword,and again burnt and deftroyed the town. At which 
time, as well as anno 1333, many of the more ancient char- 
ters and records belonging to the community were loft. 
Some years after the town was rebuilt, and confiderably 
enlarged, particularly towards the hills, upon which the 
principal part of it now (lands, «*. The Woolmanhill, St

CatharineVhill, the Port-hill, and the Caftlehill, (the 613 
town having lain along the Green and Shiprow, &amp; c . eaft- 
wards), and in this the citizens were greatly affifted by 
King David Bruce, for their Heady loyalty and attachment 
both to himfelf and his father. The fame King David re^. 
fided for fome time at Aberdeen, where he erecled a mint, 
as appears from fome pieces of money coined there ; and 
the whole town, after being rebuilt as above, was afterwards- 
called The New Town of Aberdeen, in contradiftinclion to* 
the old, which had been burnt down. 

In September 1644, during the time of the civil wars, 
the Marquis of Montrofe, with an army of about 2000 men, 
having approached the town of Aberdeen, and fummoned 
it to furrender to him, the magiftrates, after advifing 
with Lord Burley, who then commanded in the town a 
force nearly equal in number to the affailants, refuted to 
give up the town ; upon which a battle enfued within half 
an Englifti mile of the Town, at a place called the Crab- 
ftone, near to the Juftice-mills, where Montrofe prevailed, 
and many of the principal inhabitants were killed. An 
account of this engagement is contained in the council-re- 
cords. 

The city of Aberdeen has received various grants from four- 
teen different Sovereigns of Scotland, from King William the 
Lyon, downward to Kingjames Vl.inclufive, all extant in the 
town's chartulary, and, in 1638, the whole of thefe preceding 
charters- and grants were, by a charter from King Charles I. 
not only ratified and confirmed, but alfo the burgh was of 
new eretted ; and by the fame charter the Provoft and 
Bailies are conftituted Sheriffs, Coroners, and Juuices of the 
Peace, within the burgh, and whole bounds of the freedom- 
lands, and falmon-fiftiings on Dee, holden burgage of the 
Crown, the Provoft being named Sheriff and Coroner's

the magiftrates of Aberdeen have been in the conftant prac- 
tice of exercifing to the prefent day, in all caufes coming 
before them in theie capacities, and of holding quarter- 
feffions for the burgh in the fame manner as the juftices of 
the county. The magiftrates have farther granted to them 
by the faid charter the fame powers, jurifdidion, and autho- 
rity within the port, harbour, and flood-mark of Aberdeen, 
and whole bounds thereof, as well as within the rivers Dee 
and Don to the two bridges, as they have within the burgh 
itfelf and liberties, and have always exercifed that jurifdie- 
tion and authority accordingly- 

The Town-council and Dean of Guild of Aberdeen have 
likewife, by the fame charter from King Charles I. full 
power and authority committed to them, of viliting, exa- 
mining and trying all weights and meafures, ufed in buy- 
ing and felling, not only in the town, but alfo through the 
whole county of Aberdeen, which they have been, in like 
manner, in the practice of exercifing, and holding circuit 
and itinerant courts for that purpofe, in the different prin- 
cipal country towns, where any kind of trade or merchan- 
dise is carried on. 

The forefaid charter and confirmation by King Charles I. 
with the whole other writs and title-deeds therein confirm- 
ed, and rights and privileges thereby granted to the burgh, 
were afterwards folemnly ratified by different ads of Par- 
liament of Scotland, particularly by two ads in 1641 and 
1681. 

From the 1336, when the town was laft burnt, to the 
1398, there does not appear to have been any public re- 
cords regularly kept. But from the laft mentioned period 
to the prefent time, (except for about twelve years in the 
beginning of the 15th century), there is a regular and unin-

of the Town-council and Bailie-courts, all in good order 
and condition, confiding, of above 70 volumes, remaining 
in the : town's chartulary, containing in whole a conneded 
period of near 400 years. 

Before the Reformation, there were feveral chapels with- 
in the burgh and royalty, annexed to and dependent upon 
the panfh- church, particularly St Mary's Chapel, under the 
Eaft Church, where the Highland Congregation now meets 
ior worihip j St Catharine's Chapel, which flood upon the 
hill of that name; St Ninian's Chapel at the Caftlehill, 
part of which flill remains, and St Clement's Chapel at 
Futtie, which has been lately rebuilt, and is ftill occupied 
as a place of worfhip under the patronage of the council. 

There were likewife monaiteries of feveral different or- 
ders of friars, eftablifhed in Aberdeen, befide the Trinity 
and Red Friars already mentioned, viz. The Black Friars 
in the Schoplhill, where Gordon's Hofpital and the gram- 
mar-fchool now ftand. The Carmelite, or White Friars, 
along the fouth fide of the Green, and the Gray Friars in 
the Brcadgate, where the Marifchal college and church 
are now fituated. 

The batteries ereded by the town in 1781 and 1782, 
for defence of the fhipping and harbour, have coft about 
L. 1200, and they have mounted upon them ten new iron 
cannon, 12 pounders. The town has likewife two brafs 
field pieces, 3 pounders, with a proportionable quantity of 
fhot and ammunition. They have alfo 400 ftand of fmall 
arms or mufkets depofited in the town's armory, and kept 
always in excellent order by a tradefman, who has a yearly 
falary for that purpofe. 

With refpecl to the prefent municipal conftitution and 
fqrm of government of the burgh of Aberdeen, which has, 
now fubfifted, and been invariably obferved for no lefs than 
two centuries downward to this day. It is founded chiefly 

upon 



of Aberdeen. 



upon the afts of Parliament 1469 and 1474, by which all 
officers and members of the councils of burghs are appointed 
to be annually elected : " That the auld council of the 
" town mail chufe the new, in lie number as accords to it ; 
** and that the new and auld councils together mall chufe 
V all the faid officers : That ilk craft mall chufe a perfon of 
" their number, that lhall alfo have a vote in the election 
" of the officers, »md that four worthy perfons of the auld 
" council for the year before lhall be chofen yearly to fit 
" with the new council." It appears, however, that thefe 
acts of Parliament were not in any part obferved by the 
town-council of Aberdeen for above 120 years after they 
were paffed. On the contrary, they perfifted in following 
what they called the ancient form of government and auld 
confuetude of the burgh, by which it appears, that the num- 
bers of the members of council often fluctuated, and varied 
very much, from 20 to 36, and that, when once they were 
elected or affirmed, they were in general continued during 
their life, or fo long as they did not differ with the perfons 
who had affumed them ; and that the five firft magiftrates 
or officers of the burgh, viz. the Provoft, (^for many years 
ftyled Alderman), and the four Bailies, were alone elected 
annually at head-courts of the citizens, called Curia Capi- 
tals, although fometimes without mentioning by whom 
the election even of thefe officers was made, but for the 
moft part exprefled to be cum communi omnium burgenjium 
confenfu et ajfen/u et voto, which election, however, was 
equally illegal, and againft the directions of the acts of Par- 
liament, as the continuing the members for life. 

This ancient cuftom was at laft, 1590, openly challenged 
and complained of as arbitrary and illegal by a Mr John 
Cheyne, then a member of council, who infilled, that they 
fliould make an annual eleftion, in terms of thefe ftatutes, 
which they not only refufed to comply with, but expelled

him from the council, as a perfon unfit and improper to be 
of their number. He was, however, foon joined by a Mr 
Ewen, and many other burgeffes of equally patriotic pnn- 
ciples, who raifed a profecution againft the magiftrates and 
council before the Courts of Seffion and Exchequer, with 
concurrence of his Majefty's Advocate, for obliging them 
to comply with the terms of the forefaid ftatutes. The 
confequence of which was, that the council at hit, in Oclo, 
ber 1591, (after lamenting the fall of what they declared 
to be the auld confuetude and ancient form of Government 
of the burgh), agreed to follow the directions of the faid fta- 
tutes, and accordingly made an election in the terms there- 
of for the following yeaT, ending at Michaelmas 1592. 

It appears, however, that Mr Cheyne and his aflbciates 
did not get into power, upon the new conftitution, which 
they had the merit to produce, and that at the enfuing Mi- 
chaelmas they afiembled in arms in different parts of the 
town, in purpofe to overawe the proceedings of the council; 
for compofing of which violent animofities, a conference 
enfued betwixt a certain number of the council and the 
leaders of the citizens, the refult whereof happily produced 
a fubmiffion by the feveral parties concerned, of all the 
matters in difpute betwixt them to his Majefty King 
James VI. as overfman, and twelve others as arbitrators ; 
who, by a decreet-arbitral, of date 9th December 1592, 
fubfcribed by them and the parties themfelves, in teftimony 
of their approbation ; fixed and appointed the magiftrates 
and council for that year, ending at Michaelmas 1593 hy 
-•name, confiding of nineteen perfons, w'a. feventeen guild- 
brethren and two craftfmen, and ordained and appointed 
that the acts of Parliament concerning the election of ma- 
giftrates, council, and office-men within the burgh, fhould 
be prccifeJy obferved in all time thereafter.

This decreet-afbitral was, in a few days after its date, 
read to and unanimoufiy ratified by the whole burgeffes 
and citizens of the town, convened together for the pur- 
pofe, who, at the fame time, folemnly fwore to obtemper 
and obey the decreet thereafter in all points ; and which, 
with another decreet-arbitral, pronounced by the commiffion- 
ers of Burghs in July 1596, finding the craftfmen entitled 
to ten votes in the annual eleftion of the magiftrates, dean of 
guild, and treafurer, form together what is now called the Sett, 
or Municipal Conftitution of the burgh, which has been uni- 
formly obfervedas an invariable rule and ftandard in the an- 
nual ele&amp;ion of magiftrates and council to this day. By it the 
conftituent members of the town-council confift of nineteen 
in number, feventeen whereof are guild-brethren, and two 
: of them deacons of craft?. Four of the merchant-council- 
lors only are continued by election for another year, and 
the remaining fifteen members are annually changed and go 
out, and all of them are yearly elected, without any pre- 
ference or difcrimination, from a roll or lift of the whole 
burgeffes of guild in town, and of the fix deacons of trades 
previoufly made up for the purpofe, from which the leets 
of the new council are taken, and determined always ac- 
cording to the majority of votes of the council, upon the 
day of the annual eledlion, which is held upon the Wednef- 
day preceding Michaelmas day. 

After the election of the nineteen members of the new 
council, the magiftrates and office-bearers for the enfuing 
year are elected the fame day out of the feventeen mer- 
chant-councillors by the majority of votes of the new 
and old council together, and fix deacons of crafts, con- 
fiding of forty perfons in whole, viz,, thirty guild-bre- 
thren, and ten craftfmen ; and in cafe of an equality of 
votes in any of the fteps of ele&amp;ion, the Provoft, or fe- 
nior magiftrate prefent, has a decifive or calling vote,

from a comparative examination, that the prefent munici- 
pa conihtution, or fett of this borough, will be found not 
only to be a perfect contrail to its own more arbitrary and 
ancient fyftem of government, but alfo to be much more 
liberal and free than moft of the other royal burghs of 
bcotland ; becaufe, in many of them, feme of the members 
of council, and even magnates, do ftill continue in office 
during hfe, or fo long as they agree with the party in 
power ; and in others, feveral of the members of council 
are entitled to keep their feats without election for a fecond 
year, m confequence of their having enjoyed certain offices 
for the preceding ; whereas, in Aberdeen, every magiftrate 
and member of council, even the old four, mull be annually 
elefted, without regard to any office which they may have 
formerly held, and fifteen of the whole number are yearly 
changed, and go out *. 

The laws refpedting the police of the city are contained 
in an aft of Parliament, granted in 1795. According to 
this ad, thirteen perfons are to be elecfed and appointed 
commiffioners by the inhabitants of the city. None, how- 
ever, can have a vote unlefs he pays at leall L. 5 yearly of 
houfe-rent. The Provoft for the time being prefides at 
the eledion, and has the carting vote. The commiffioners

fliall invariably be of the number of thofe eight commif- 
fioners who were elected two years before, and lhall be 
chofen to continue in office by the collective body of the 
other commiflioners, by figned lifts to be given in by a ma- 
jority of them to their prefes or clerk, fourteen days pre- 
vious to the then next general meeting for election, fo as to 
preferve as nearly as poffible an equal rotation in duty. 
Thefe commiflioners have full power to nominate iand ap- 
point treafurers, clerks, collectors, fcavengers, lighters of 
lamps, and other fervants proper and neceflary under them 
in the execution of their office. This office refpects chiefly 
the paving, lighting, and cleaning the ftreets, and fupply- 
ing the city with water. The money neceflary for de- 
fraying the expence in executing thefe public matters is, 
by the^ct, to be raifed by an affeflment upon the inhabi- 
tants of the city of 1 s. Sterling in the pound yearly for 
every dwelling-houfe, or ftiop, cellar, warehoufe, or other 
building within the city and royalty, aftually occupied and 
poffefled at the time by any one perfon, which fhall be efti- 
mated at or above L. 1, 5 s. Sterling of yearly rent. A 
rent-roll of fuch houfes, &amp;x. is to be annually made up by 
fifteen perfons chofen for that purpofe. This affeflment is 
to be paid by the tenant or occupier of the houfe ; and if 
the money thus raifed is found not to be fufficient for an- 
fwering the purpofes of widening and improving the ftreets, 
and anfwering the other purpofes of the police for which 
the aft was obtained, the commiflioners are authorifed and 
empowered to raife and increafe the faid afleffment of 1 s. 
Sterling in the pound of houfe-rents yearly (for a certain 
number of years then to be fixed by fuch general meeting 
of the inhabitants) to any mm or rate not exceeding 1 s. 6 d.

Population. 

It as not known that there are extant any records which 
contain the flate of the population of this citv at any diitant 
period. The population, however, owing chiefly to the 
rapid progrefs of manufactures, has greatly increafed within 
thefe 40 years. In 1755, according to Dr Webfter's ac- 
count, it was 10,488. It appears, according to lifts taken 
lip by order of the minifters in 17S9, that the number of 
fouls in what is called St Nicholas pariah, amounted to 
J6.386. According to a lift of the inhabitants within the 
iliicl limits of the city, as divided into four quarters, taken 
an the month of July 1795, by a committee appointed by 
an aft palled in the laft fefiion of Parliament, for making up 
the nrft rent-roll, and fuperintending the firft eleftion of 
comniiflioners of police, the population was as follows :

Of the ancient ftate of the population of Old Machar. 
the feffion-records make no mention. It would appear, 
however, from the many houfes that have lately been 
built, and manufactures eftablimed, that the population has 
greatly increafed within the lad 50 years.— The population 
in 1755, according to Dr WebhWs account, was only 4945. 
In the year 1790 it amounted to 8107, of whom 3535 were 
males, and 4572 females; of thefe, there refided in the 
city of Old Aberdeen, including the Spitral, 1713 ; in the 
town of GUcomfton, 2234; and in the country, including 
the villages at Windmillbrae, Hardgate, Bridge of Don, 
and Printfield, 4160. As the numbers in the laft men- 
tioned villages are not, in the minifters lilts, diflinguilhed 
from thofe in the adjacent parts of the country, it is impof- 
iible, with any degree' of accuracy, to feparate them here. 

The number of marriages, baptiims, &amp;c. in the parilb of 
Old Machar will be feen in the following tables :

of Aberdeen. 175 

Though the preceding tables are as accurate as can bo 
made from our regifters, they are by no means perfeftly 
correct. That no perfon may be mined by forming calcu- 
lations from them, I have therefore deemed it expedient to 
fubjoin the following remarks : — From the regifter of mar- 
riages I have given in the firft column of the tables the 
number of marriages in which the man only refided in the 
parifh ; in the fecond column, the number in which the 
woman only refided in the parifh ; and in the third, the 
number in which both parties belonged to the parifh. As 
in mod marriages, in which the parties refide in different 
parifhes, the woman is fuppofed to leave her own, and to go 
to herhufband's parifh, I confider the fourth column, which 
gives the fum of the firft and third, as containing the num- 
ber of marriages which properly belong to this parifh. As, 
however, feveral inftances have occurred, in which the man 
has come to refide in the parifh of the woman, this mode of 
reckoning may not be perfectly accurate ; I have therefore 
chofen to add the fecond and fifth columns, that every per- 
fon may calculate from the table upon any principle he may 
incline to adopt. I muft farther obferve, that the number 
of marriages mentioned in the table, efpecially daring the 
laft ten years, is confiderably fhort of the truth. This is 
owing to many loofe and diforderly perfons, who are an- 
nually fined for irregular marriages by the juftices of peace. 
In fuch inftances the ignorant parties always confider the 
magiftrate, and avowedly fpeak of him as the celebrator of 
the marriage. They are tempted to have recourfe to this 
abfurd and irregular method of obtaining marriage, becaule 
it may be accomplifhed with greater fecrecy and expedi- 
tion than by obferving the legal ceremonies. It is there- 
fore frequently adopted in this place, when the cdnfent of 
parents cannot be obtained, when the woman is pregnant, 
or when prudence, or the laws of the country prefent any 

obftacle 



Statijlical Account 



obftacle that would flop or retard the marriage. I knoW aa 
inftance m a neighbouring parilh in which parties within 
the forbidden degrees of confanguinity were thus married. 
When a young couple meet with any obftacle to their 
umon,-when, from wantonnefs or humour, they fpurn all 
regular forms,_or when they are too impatient to wait for 
proclamations, they apply to the procurator- fifcal to get a 
juftice of peace to marry them. He inftrucls them to tell 
the juftice that they were married at fuch a time, but to re- 
fufe to name the celebrator and witnefies. Whereupon the 
judge firft decerns them to pay the legal fine ; and next, 
upon a reprefentation of their poverty, &amp;c. by virtue of his 
or their power as juftice or juftices of peace, modify this 
fine, fometimes to half a guinea, fometimes to 5 s. and fome- 
times even to much Iefs. They get an extra2 of this fen- 
tence, pay the procurator-fifcal, and the ceremony is over. 
Can any idea be more ridiculous, than that a perfon mould 
apply to a public profecutor, pay him, and be inftrucled to tell 
a lie to the magiftrate, merely to get himfelf punimed for a 
crime, which he is confcious he never committed. Many 
of thefe poor creatures are afterwards fo aftiamed of this 
farce, that they apply to their parifli-minifters to be regu- 
larly married. To what length the abfurd and wanton ir- 
regularity of juftice of peace marriages, as they are called, 
may be carried, and what riiforder they may introduce into 
fociety, if not checked by the Legiflature, it is hard to fay. 
Surely the laws againft irregular marriages were intended 
to prevent, not to encourage fuch pra&amp;ices. While, how. 
ever, they are thus executed, if this can be called executing 
them, they are fo managed as to defeat their own end. I 
know of no claufe in all the atts of Parliament relating to 
fuch marriages' that permits the juftice to mitigate the line. 
On the contrary, they are exprefsly appointed to fubftitute 
certain corporal puniftinients in place of the legal fine, when 

the

the pities are unable to pay it. If they would adhere to 
this alternative, the laws would be reftored to their proper 
efficacy and this branch of their jurifditfion would foon af- 
ford them very little employment. But while they affume 
powers, with which they do not feem to me to be entrufted 
hy the laws of their country, I am under a neceffity of con- 
fidering them as ad.ng in thefe inftances, not as the guar- 
dians of order, but as the perverters of the law, and the 
promoters of confufion. We have here fome jufuces of 
fpeedy growth ; but I would be wanting in candour, if I 
did not acknowlege, that the real gentlemen of this county 
have in general confidered it as beneath the dignity of their 
chancer to take any concern in irregular marriages, that 
they uniformly refufe fuch applications, and that when fuch 
applications have been made to them, their good advice 
has often prevailed with the parties to have recourfe to the 
forms which the laws of the country prefcribe. 

As to the regifter of baptifms, no trouble has been fpared 
to render it correft. The two parochial minifters feldom 
baptife a child, without caufing the parent bring an attefta- 
tion, that he has paid for having his child's name regiftered 
and the minifter of the Chapel of Eafe keeps an accurate 
lift of the children baptifed by him, which he fends annual- 
ly to the feflion-clerk. Several perfons are alfo employed 
to procure information of thofe who are baptifed by differ- 
ing clergymen of different denomination. Notwithftanding 
all this care, feveral baptiims annually occur, which are not 
recorded. Befides, the children of a very few Quakers who 
are never baptifed, and fome who are either born dead, or die 
fo foon after their birth that they cannot be baptifed, can- 
not be mentioned in the regifter of baptifms. The annual 
births in the parifh muft therefore exceed the numbers 
ftated in the tables, I fuppofe, by a dozen at leaft.

the average bunals in the church-yard to that of the Spittal 
burying-ground during the iaft ten years, and in this manner 
the average number of the whole burials in the parifh for 
the firft two periods may be found. In all the regifters of 
burials fome mftances occurred in which the fex of the per- 
fon bttried was not afcertained j in thefe cafes, either the 
iirname only of the perion buried was mentioned, or the 
keeper of the regifter charged.him felf for the burial lair (g^v^

To afcertain with any tolerable degree of accuracy the pro- 
portion of the fexes buried in the parifli, I was therefore 
obliged to infert in the tables of burials, in diftincl: columns, 
the numbers in which the regifters mentioned the fex ; and' 
to ihow the whole number, I have added a third column, 
entitled, Sex unknown. I have only to obferve farther

are brought from other parifhes, efpecially from Aberdeen, 
and buried here. This is owing partly to their forefathers 
having lived, died, and been buried in this parifh-, and 
partly to the burial lairs being much cheaper here than in 
Aberdeen. From the manner in which the regifters are 
kept, it is impoffible to determine how many of the per- 
fons buried belong to the parifh, and how many are ftran- 
gers, otherwife I fhould have marked this diflinclion 
by inferting their refpe&amp;ive numbers in feparate co- 
lumns. By thefe obfervations it will appear, that no cal- 
culations refpe&amp;ing the general population of the pa- 
rifh can be juftly founded on the tables of burials, and 
that the rule of multiplying the burials by 36 would lead 
us greatly to over-rate the population of the place. But as 
by far the greater number of ftrangers buried here are 
brought from Aberdeen, and as the fame caufes render the 
number of females in both places fuperior to that of the 
males, calculations from the deaths, intended to eftablifh, 
not the real number of people, but the proportion of the 
fexes actually living in the parifli, though not accurate, 
will come nearer the truth. 

As the numbers who annually come from other places 
to refide in Old Machar are greater than the numbers who 
emigrate from it, and as the number of baptifms inferted 
in the regifter falls fhort of the real number of births in the 
parifh, the rule of multiplying the number of births by 26 
would lead us to under-rate the population of the place. 
As in this inftance, the errors arifing from this mode of 
calculation are eafily accounted for by the daily influx of 
ftrangers into a large city and its neighbourhood, perhaps 
thefe rules for afcertaining the population of a country 
may be found to hold with fufHcient accuracy, if the births

and burials for Aberdeen, and a large diflrict round it, are 
taken into the account. 

With regard to the population of this parifh, it may be 
proper farther to obferve, that from what is already men- 
tioned, it appears that the females exceed the males by 
1037, which is more than an eighth part of the whole 
number. That this remarkable difparity in the number 
of the different fexes really exifls in this parifh is evident 
from the mini/ter's rolls, which are as accurate as the very 
fluctuating ftate of the people in fo populous a place will 
admit of. It cannot be explained either by the births or 
burials. For from the preceding tables it appears, that du- 
ring three diftinct periods of ten years each, the number of 
males born in the parifli has confiderably exceeded that of 
females. If they all had continued in the parifh, the ba- 
lance ought certainly to have been in favour of the males, 
which is the reverfe of the fact. If this difparity were 
owing to any extraordinary mortality among the males, it 
could only be temporary, and would appear by their form- 
ing a majority in the regifter of burials, which the ta- 
bles fhew to be alfo the reverfe of the fact. It may, 
however, be fatisfactorily explained by the following oh- 
fervations : "Moll of our manufactures, efpecially the bleach- 
ing and thread-making bunnefTes, employ a much greater 
number of women than of men ; and the great manufac- 
ture of the place, the knitting of flockings, is carried on al- 
moft entirely by females. Accordingly, while moll of our 
women remain at home, many of our young men emigrate 
to other places, in queft of more lucrative employment 
than they can find in this part of the country. Befides, the 
temptations of cheap and commodious houfes, of eafy ac- 
cefs to fuel, and to all the neceflaries and comforts of life, 
frQrn our vicinity to the port and market of Aberdeen, and 

Qf.

bf the high probability of finding employment from fome 
of the many manufaftures carried on in the neighbourhood, 
induce many old women, and many of the widows and 
daughters of farmers and tradefmen, to leave the country, 
and refide in this parlfti, while their fons have either fettled 
as farmers in their native place, or gone abroad, or entered' 
into the army or navy. If to thefe obfervations we add, 
that in all paddies, in which there are feVeral large towns 
and villages, moft families need more female than male fer- 
vants, the majority of females in this parifli, great as It is, 
will be fufficiently accounted for. 

The annual average of baptifms for ten years immediately 
after 1722, is 90^; for ten years after the 1752, 89A; 
and for ten years after 1782, 124^. To this average 12 
at leaft mould be annually added to make up for thofe not 
inferted in the regifter. 

The annual average of burials for ten years immediately 
after the 1722 is, in the parifli church -yard, 95^, and in 
the Snow church-yard, 2 ; for ten years after the 1752, m 
the parifli church-yard, 57/^, and in the Snow church-yard, 
2 ; for ten years after the 1782, in the parifli church-yard, 
104^, in the Snow church-yard, 2 ; and in the Spittal 
church-yard, 241-r^ ' in all, 348-^. 

The average number of marriages properly belonging to 
the parifli for eight years immediately after the 1722 is, 
25-jV, for ten years immediately after 1752, it is 33^ j 
and for ten years immediately after the 1782, it is 51. In 
calculating the above average of marriages, thofe in which 
the women only reGded in the parifli are excluded, and no 
allowance is made for the juftice of peace marriages, feveral 
of which annually occur. 

From the above ftatements of the populat'uin of the city 
and parifties of Aberdeen, it appears, that the whole in

Remarks. — The above ftate comprehends the three paftoral charges into 
which the town of Aberdeen is divided. Thefe, together with the village 
of Futtie, which (being under Ihe charge of a diftindt. catechift, who has 
hitherto been ordained, but not reckoned a minifter of Aberdeen) is not 
included in this ftate, make up the parifli ,of St Nicholas. It comprehends 
none of the extenfive fuburbs weft and fouth from the Denburn, they ha- 
ving belonged to the deanry of Aberdeen, and now to the parifli of St Ma- 
char, commonly called Old Machar, or Old Aberdeen. In tiie/'e there has 
been a very great increafe of inhabitants within the laft forty years. 

The above ftate takes in, not the number of fouls, but only of exami- 
nable perfons, as the minifters included not children in their lifts. They 
reckoned them examinable as foon as they had Teamed to read, and could 
anfwer ifome of the common queftions ; fo that their lilts contained 
at leaft all perfons of five years old and upwards. In calculating from 
thefe i die number of fouls, it is to be obferved, that in Aberdeen (and 
perhaps in moil towns) the number of children bears a lefs proportion to 
that of fouls than in country pariflies ; one reafon of which is, that many 
aged perfons, particularly fingle women, retire to towns, and accommodate 
themfelves in fmall rooms. This h found to hold in Aberdeen ; for one of 

the 



of Aberdeen. 



This town and neighbourhood is not remarkable for any 
uncommon or epidemical difeafe. A certain kind of pu 
trid fore throat, however, raged lately, and cut off many of 

the 

the miners, for a few years of the above period, took an account .of the 
whole fouls in the part of the town under his charge, and was furpnfed ha 
thole under the examinable age were fo few in companion. From his bfls 
the number of fouls in the Other charges might have been nearly calculated, 
but he neglected it at the time, and as he has been dead for fome years, we 
do not know whether any of his lifts can be row recovered. 

The increafe of inhabitants during the above period arofe in a good mea. 
fure from the introduction and extenfion of manufactures, and alfo from 
the great demand for ftones for paving the ftreets of London; which 
brought a multitude of labourers from all parts of the country to Aber- 
deen and its neighbourhood-, and after that demand flackened, many of 
thefe remained with their families in Aberdeen, as a proper place for ob- 
taining employment as day-labourers. Many likewife, who have come up 
as patients to the infirmary, have, after being cured, fettled w.th the fame 
view. Thefe circumftances have alfo contributed to a great increafe ot po- 
pulation in the adjacent parts of the parifh of OldMachar. 

For fome vears previous to the above period, there had been a considera- 
ble increafe in the population of Aberdeen, owing chiefly to the introduce 
tion of manufactures, but partly alfo to the extenfive cultivation of land, 
formerly wafte in the environs, which found occupation for many addi- 
tional hands. 

Aberdeen affords a fignal confirmation of the vagueneft of conjectural 
accounts of the number of inhabitants of a town, and of its always far ex- 
ceeding the truth. For, during the above period, the writer of this account 
happened to alk a gentleman who had been in a public ftation for near fifty 
years, and had beftowed fome attention on the ftate of the town, What 
was in his younger days reckoned the number of inhabitants ? And what 
the proportion between Prefbyterians and Epifcopalians ? His anfwer was, 
that the examinable perfons were always reckoned at leaft 10,000 ; and the 
Prefbyterians and Epifcopalians nearly equal in number : But for a few 
years previous to the period of the abuve ftate, there had been a very great 
increafe of population, (in one of the three paftora! charges in one year, no 
lefs than about 500), and yet at the beginning of that period they fell lar fliort 
of the number fpecified ; and through the whole period the Prefbyterians 
were nearly to the Epifcopalians as 3*. to I, and to all Diffenteis together 
(of whom the Seccders were originally Prefbyterians) as 2*. to one.

Aeyonngofbothfexea. lathe ye ar x 7 8 9 , the genuine 
Wmerta broke out m Foottie, and raged with confide- 
rable vmlence. . The only check to it that proved efFeZi 
was by removing the infetfed perfons into a temporary 
hofpxtal, where they received medical aid, and every necefl 
fary accommodation at the public expence, the money 
being raifed by fubfcription. 

The provincial dialed of the Englifh, which is gene- 
rally fpoken here, is not commonly confidered as beimr 
very pure. Owing, however, to a much greater inter- 
courfe with the Englifh than formerly, a fenfible change to 
the better has taken place in the idiom. Some old people 
remember when many broad Scotch words and phrafes 
were current, even in the befl companies, which are now 
fcarcely ever to be heard in the Wfl. The confideration 
alfo that this is a place of education, the feat of an univer- 
iity ofconfiderable eminence, has proved an inducement 
to feveral, efpecially to thofe who have entertained thoughts 
of publifhing in Englifh, to make the proper idiom of the 
language more a matter of fludy than was ever done at any 
former period, a circumflance that has not failed to pro- 
duce good effects. 

Whatever may have been the original language of the 
inhabitants of this place ; and whatever may have been the 
changes which at different periods it has undergone, it is 
undeniable, that for many centuries back the old Scotch 
dialect, whofe affinity to the Englifh is manifeft, has been 
the language, not of this place only, but of all the eaffern 
coafl of Scotland. Now, though the oldeft names, fuch as 
thofe of mountains, rivers, towns of high antiquity, and 
trails of country, are probably, as was already hinted, from 
the ancient Britifh ; and though fome names of a lower 
epoch, from the intercourfe of the inhabitants with High- 
landers, or Irifh Scots, are doubtlefs from the Erfe ; yet by 

far 



of Aberdeen. 



183 



far the gveateft number of names of places are from the old 
Scotch dialed, which has been now for many ages the lan- 
guage of the country. Not any more remarkable inftan- 
ces of fuch derivation in this parifli can be given, than the 
names of the ftreets of the town, the principal of which are 
the Caftlegate, the Braidgate, the Overkirkgate, the Ne- 
therkirkgate, the Gallowgate. Add to thefe, the Gaift- 
raw, the Shipraw, the Rottenraw, the Dubbyraw, the 
Checkeraw, the Narrow-wynd, the Back-wynd, the Cor- 
reftion-wynd. Thefe, with Putachie's-fide, and the Green, 
are almoft all the old names of ftreets and lanes in the 
town. We cannot give a better example than in this very 
thing of the advances noticed in a former article, which we 
are daily making towards Englifti. We almoft never hear 
now of the Braidgate and the Caftlegate. They are become 
univerfally the Broadftreet and the Caftleftreet. The Gal- 
lowgate, for what good reafon we know not, has not yet 
lhared in this reformation, for nobody ventures upon Gal- 
lowjlreet. The Kirkgates too remain the fame as ever. 
They are never called Churchjlreets, though we more com- 
monly fay the Upper than the Over Kirkgate, There is 
little or no change made on the other pafiages called wynds 
and raws. Only it is to be obferved, that in all thofe 
which have been made in the city or fuburbs for at leaft 
fifty years paft, we have neither gates nor ivynds ; they are 
all Jlreets and lanes. Thus we have within that period 
got  §hieen-Jlreet, Marjhal-Jlreet, North-Street, Shoe-lane, 
Jujiice-lane, ifc. i£c. If the fame humour prevails in 
other places of the country, we may conclude, that 
the words gate and wynd, occurring in any compound 
names of the paflages through a city or town in Scotland, 
will ferve as evidences of an antiquity higher at leaft than 
the middle of the 18th century. As to the names of the 
few hills, gentlemen's feats, &amp;c lying near the town, they 

appear.

appear as far as we, can difcover, to be of the fame origin. 
Thus Ferry Inil, Frojler-hll, (the word Frojier probably 
corrupted from ForreferJ, Mlton,' Rolfa^ Kin^Z, 
Qmntefi -wells, Whitemire, Some are more obfcure in 
their -origin, as Fitmuckjlon, Rodrieflon, Tarry , Funic. 13 c. 
Of this laft rt was obferved, that fome refolve it into Foot- 
Dee, the foot of Dee. But this is directly contrary to die 
common rule of analogy in the derivation of words. When 
any thing j, e^preffed by one word in our language, (and 
this holds in both dialects, Englifh and Scotch), reorefent- 
mg H as a part or member of fome other thing, tfrat other 
thing makes the firft part of the compound name, and the 
part or member makes invariably the laft part. Thus the 
mouth of the Wey is Weymouth, not Monthly ; and that 
the Scotch, in this formation of words, is the fame with 
the Enghfh, appears from fome names of places in this 
neighbourhood. Thus we have Loanbead, not Headlong 
for the head of the loan or loaning ; Craighg, not Lugcraig, 
for the lug, that is, the ear of the craig. If, therefore, 
they mean to call the place the foot of the river, it would 
have been unquestionably Deefoot, not Foot-Dee. But we 
are not even certain that the mouth of a river is either in 
Scotch or Engliui ever called the foot. 

Ecclefiajlical State of Aberdeen. 
The two principal churches of this city, which at pre- 
fent are called the Eajl and IVeJl, were formerly called the 
Old and New Churches. The church which ftood where 
the Weft Church now ftands was called the Old, and is fup- 
pofed (though upon what evidence is not certain) to have 
been feveral centuries older than the other. The ftile of 
architecture, though both were Gothic, was very different 
from that of the Eaft (formerly called the New) Church, 
flilHtanding, and which likewife is of an uncertain date. 

The 



of Aberdeen. 



The Old Church was pulled down, and rebuilt, about the 
year 1754.— The College Church belonged to the Grey- 
Friars, and was purchafed by the Magistrates from the 
College. There is no account when it was built. 

In the city of Aberdeen are three parochial charges, 
and one in the village of Futtie. There are two charges 
in Old Machar. The exaft value of the living is L. 126 
Sterling^r annum to each parochial minifter, without any 
manfe or glebe- The patronage is vefted in the Magi- 
ftrates and Town-council for the time being.

State of the Poor. 
The number of poor at prefent in Aberdeen, who re- 
ceive ftated and occafional fupplies from public charitable 
funds, amounts to 481; befides 25 boys, who are main- 
tained in the Poor-houfe. The funds appropriated for their 
ufe are at an average about L. 829 Sterling per annum. 
Of this fum L. 210 Sterling are allowed for the fupport of 
the Poor-houfe, in which are a matter, miftrefs, and fer- 
vants, to fuperintend the education, &amp;c. of the boys. The 
fum of L. 151, 5 s. of the remainder is allotted to the ex- 
clufive management of the kirk-feffion, which, after pay- 
ing the falaries of their officers, they diftribute among poor 
families, who have no ftated fupplies from other funds. 

Hofpituhy Infirmary, bc. 
The inhabitants of Aberdeen feem to have been always 
diftinguifhed for generous and humane actions. Several 
very ample mortifications and donations for pious and cha- 
ritable purpofes were made by different perfons, belonging 
to this place, in the laft century. But as a full and accurate 
account of thefe cannot be given, notice fhall only be taken 
of fome, which have been made fince the beginning of 
this. 

Robert Gordon, merchant in Aberdeen, by deeds of 
mortification, of date 13th December 1729, and the 19th 
September 1730, founded an Hofpital for the maintenance 
and education of indigent boys in Aberdeen, being the fons 
and grandfons of burgeffes of guild, or the fons and grand- 
fons of tradefmen of the faid burgh, being freemen or bur- 
geffes thereof ; and for the purpofes of it he affigned his 
whole eftate, perfonal and real, to the Provoft, Bailies, and 
remanent members of the Council of Aberdeen, and the 
four minifters of Aberdeen, whom he appointed perpetual 
Patrons and Governors of the Hofpital. 

x Mr 



of Aberdeen,

Mr Gordon having died about the year 1731, his affig- 
nees obtained poffeffion of his funds ; and from the produce 
of them purchafed an acre, and built a proper houfe for the 
Hofpital. When the funds had accumulated to a proper 
degree, they took in boys, and the inftitution has gone on 
finee with remarkable fuccefs ; and there are at prefent 
maintained, clothed, and educated in it 60 boys, at the an- 
nual expence of upwards of L. 1000 Sterling, which the 
Governors are now enabled to afford, by the early purchafe 
of lands, and afterwards feuing them out to great advan- 
tage. 

The branches of education taught in this hofpital are, 
reading Englifti, Englifh-grammar, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, the elements of geometry, navigation, geo- 
graphy, French, church-mulic; and fuch of the boys as dis- 
cover a genius for it, are inftrucled in drawing alfo. Thefe 
branches of education, together with a proper inftrudtion 
in the principles of the Chriftian religion, are carried on 
under the direction of three matters, who constantly refide 
in the houfe ; the drawing mailer being only employed 
occafionally, and moftly during the fummer; and the ma- 
iler for church-mufic attending twice or thrice a-week. 

The boys mult not be under nine years of age when ad-i 
mitted into the Hofpital, and muft leave it at 16 years of 
age. They are put to proper trades, under the direction 
of the Governors ; L. 8 : 6 : 8 Sterling are allowed for ap- 
prentice-fee i and, upon finilhing their apprenticelhip, they 
are allowed each L. 5 Sterling to affift them in entering in- 
to bufinefs. 

Anno 1772, the Governors judged it proper, for remo- 
ving objections to their management, to apply to his Ma- 
jeay for a charter of incorporation, and it was obtained, in. 
corporating them under the name and title of, The Prefident 
and Governors of Robert Gordon's Hofpital in Aberdeen.

Statijlical Account 



Anno 1739, the town of Aberdeen formed a r&amp;u 

oZ° " P*™** Ab -deen, for the benefit 

of the difeafed, m all the northern parts of the kingdom. 
Jor carrying this purpofe into execution, fubfcriptions were 
fct on foot, and the well difpofed were fo liberal in pro- 
moting this pious defign, that a part of the houfe for the 
accommodation of patients was finifhed anno 1742, in a 
plam but decent manner. An addition was made to the 
houfe anno 1745, by which they were enabled to admit a 
greater number of patients ; and afterwards, from the great 
Dumber of patients who applied, they were under the ne- 
ceffity of adding another wing in the year 1759. fn the 
year 1772, they applied to the Crown for, and obtained a 
charter of incorporation. 

The number of thofe admitted into the Infirmary annu- 
ally, at an average for three years part, amounts to 1126. 
Out patients receive advice and medicines to the number 
of about 2500. 

The annual expence of the houfe, at an average for fome 
years paft, has amounted to L. 1300 Sterling. Their fixed 
funds are about L. 400 Sterling; and for the other L. 900 
they depend upon collections through different parifhes, 
•and upon donations. 

Anno 1786, Baillie James Cruickfhank, merchant in 
this city, represented to the managers, that fome perfons, 
defirous of promoting the profperify and fuccefs of the In- 
firmary, (but who wifh to remain unknown), had refolved 
to eafe it, in a great meafure, of the debt it then laboured 
under, by paying a fum of L. 500 Sterling for that purpofe. 
He alio informed them, that fome perfons had agreed to 
make a donation of L. 1500 Sterling, to be flocked lor the 
benefit of the Infirmary, and the intereft thereof for ever 
to be applied for the life of the patients in general; and he 

defired 



of Aberdeen,

defired that no public notice fhould be taken of thefe dona- 
tions in the newfpapers. 

A few years ago, a day-labourer, William Muir, who a 
good man}' years ago had been a patient in the Infirmary, 
and received benefit from it, has given to the Infirmary no 
lefs a fum than L. 155 Sterling, as the- beginning of a fund 
for building a fever ward, referving to himfelf, and his 
wife only, if fhe furvive him, the intereft of the above 
fum, and he ftill continues to work for his own and fami- 
ly's fubfiftence. 

Anno 1741, Mr John Richart of Achhecant, by a deed 
of fettlement, of date the 20th of October, ordained, that 
(after the payment of certain legacies, mentioned in faid 
deed) the remainder of his executry mould be paid towards 
endowing an Infirmary and Work-houfe in Aberdeen. Af- 
ter the death of Mr Richart, it was found that the remain- 
der of his eftate, after paying all the legacies mentioned in 
his will, amounted to about L. 4172 Sterling, one half of 
which, vh. L. 2080 Sterling, *was to be applied towards 
endowing a Work-houfe. For this purpofe the Magiftrates 
and Council (the executors of Mr Richart's will) bought 
the ground-right and ruins of an old tenement of houfes 
and a garden, and afterwards repaired faid houfe, and built 
fome additions to it, at a confiderable expence, all of which 
was paid, partly by the Magiftrates, and partly by volun- 
tary contributions from the different corporations, and from 
private individuals in town, without breaking in upon Mr 
Richart's mortification. 

To the above mortification the Magiftrates added a morti- 
fication under their management, legateed by Mr John Kemp, 
of the parifh of St Martin's in the Fields, in the county of 
Middlefex, apothecary, anno 17 13, the annual produce of 
jvhich is about L. 48 Sterling, and deftined by the morti-

fier for maintaining a free-fchool for educating and brW 
wg up poor children. 6 g 

The Poor's Hofpital was opened the laft day of Oaober 
1741, for the reception of fuch idle and ftrolling vagrants 
.» lhould.be found » town, and the poor inhabitants! who 
had no v lfi ble way of earn i„g their bread ; alfo for boys 
and gl rls, the children of poor inhabitants, and for deftitute 
orphans, who had no relations to take care of them. Every 
penon m the houfe was to be employed in work or labour 
of fome kind, according to their ftrength and capacity. 
Ihe children to attend the fchool in the houfe for certain 
hours every day : the boys to be taught reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and inftruaed in the principles of Chriftian 
knowledge, and bound to trades when they came to a cer- 
tain age. The girls to be taught knitting of ftockings, 
and other branches of female education, to qualify them for 
being good fervants. The various kinds of labour carried 
on within the houfe were, picking of oakum, beating hemp, 
carding and fpinning coarfe wool and flax, manufafturing 
coarfe cloth, and knitting ftockings. 

The managers of the Hofpital were the Magistrates and 
Council for the time being, and fome of the moft refpeft- 
able inhabitants chofen annually by the Magittrates and 
Council out of the different focieties and perfuafions. After 
carrying on the inftitution on the above plan for fome 
years, it was thought more proper for the health of the 
poor inhabitants, to allow them, at their own houfes, what 
the charitable funds and contributions could afford. Ac- 
cordingly, the manufacture was difcontinued, and the num. 
ber in the Hofpital is now reftricted to 25 boys, who are 
maintained and educated in the houfe, and are the fons of 
poor inhabitants. The annual expence of the houfe amounts 
to about L. 2 to Sterling, which is paid in part from the 
annual produce of Mr Richart and Mr Kemp's mortifica- 
tions, 



of Aberdeen. 



tions, and the deficiency from other monies belonging to 
the poor. 

Anno 1759. Alexander Michie, wright in Aberdeen, 
difponed a tenement, confifting of two fmall dwelling- houfes 
and a garden, in favour of the Poor's Hofpital, which now 
rent at between L. 11 and L. 12 Sterling annually. 

Mr James Man, rnafter of the Hofpital, who died anno 
1762, after appointing certain legacies to be paid by his 
executors, or to the amount of his effects, ordained the re- 
mainder to be paid to the managers of the Poor's Hofpital, 
to be put out at intereft, and the annual rent to be fpecially 
applied to the paying of apprentice-fees for the boys, who 
Ihould be brought up in the houfe, and bound to trades. 
The amount on Mr Man's effects (after paying all his lega- 
cies, debts, and funeral charges) was L. 95 Sterling. The 
intereft of this fum was allowed to accumulate, till the whole 
amounted to L. 200 Sterling, the annualrent of which is 
now applied to paying apprentice-fees for boys, brought up 
in the Poor's Hofpital, and bound out to trades, at the rate 
of 10 s. annually for each boy during his apprenticefliip, 
which is generally lix years. 

By an account we had from the late clerk of the Poor's 
Hofpital, anno 1784, there were no lefs than 36 charitable 
focieties in this town, befides the corporations ; and then- 
annual difburfements to the poor, amounted to L. 1183 
Sterling. 

Mr John Burnet, late merchant in Aberdeen, did, by a 
deed executed by him, February 1. 1785, difpone to the 
minifters of Aberdeen of the Eftabliflied Church, and the, 
other members of the kirk-feffion of Aberdeen for the 
time-being, and their fucceffors in office, and four other 
truftees named by himfelf, and a delegate to be chofen from 
the Infirmary and Poor's Hofpital annually, two-thirds of 
the yearly free produce of the lands of Klnnadie, and others 

mentioned

mentioned in the deed of mortification, for the relief of 
fuch perfons, living in the town and parilh of Aberdeen 
only, who are unable to fuftain themfelves, and who are 
bedrids, or afflided with bodily difeafes, that are fuppofed 
to be incurable, and failing fuch, for the relief of any other 
fick poor people, and particularly fuch as are amifted with 
lingering difeafes ; and failing fuch, for any other indigent 
and poor people, and particularly the aged, living in the 
town and parilh of Aberdeen. 

Anno 1782, November 2d, a fubfcription was opened 
for obtaining a fupply of grain to the poor of Old and New 
Aberdeen, and, in a few weeks, to the great praife of the 
inhabitants, as well as relief of the poor, the fubfcription 
amounted to no lefs than L. 1728, 13 s. Sterling. Two 
gentlemen were fent to England to purchafe grain : A com- 
mittee was appointed, and met once a- week, for attending 
to and relieving the diftrefs of the poor while it continued : 
To encourage importing meal, peafe, flour, potatoes, boun- 
ties were granted ; the ordinary cuftom on meal was dif- 
penfed with, and the price of the meal lowered from time 
to time, and given out in proportion to the numbers and 
neceflities of the poor families. 

Anno 1787, three fifbermen were drowned in attempting 
to enter the harbour of the Cove. A fubfcription was 
opened for their widows and children, which amounted to 
L. 36 : 17 : 9 Sterling. 

Anno 1790, May 17th, a boat belonging to the Cove, in 
the parifti of Nigg, and neighbourhood of this city, was loft. 
Five of the men in the boat were married, and left widows 
and 25 children; the. fixth man was unmarried, but left an 
aged mother, who, in a great meafure, depended upon him 
for fubfiftence. The Collections and fubferiptions made for 
thqm in Aberdeen amounted to L. 103 ."4:3 Sterling. 

Mr 



of Aberdeen. 



Mr James Thain, merchant in Aberdeen, about three 
years ago, made over to truftees named by him L..400 Ster- 
ling ; the intereft he appoints as a falary for a mailer, who 
ihall teach the children of the poor of this pity reading, 
writing, and arithmetic, and bfedft them in the principles 
of the Chriftian religion, without demanding any fees from 
them. Forty boys and girls are taught at this fchool, 
'and the worthy founder, who is ftill alive, frequently vifits 
it, and is more happy in obferving its continued fuccefs, 
than if he had received a much greater fum to himfelf 
than he has given for this laudable inftitution. 

Difpenfary, 

The Aberdeen Difpenfary was inMtuted in the year 
1781, for the purpofe of attending, at their own houfes, 
fuch patients as could not be admitted into the Infirmary ; 
It is fupported by the bounty of the public, and is under the 
management of contributors. Dr Gordon, the prefent 
phylician, has had the charge of it for ten years. 

The utility of the inftitution to the poor will appear 
from the following abftra&amp;s. 

' But it is calculated to be extremely ufeful in other re- 
fpe&amp;s ; namely, as being an excellent fchool for the educa- 
tion of medical ftudents, and on account of the ample field 
it prefents for obfervation, and the acquifition of pra&amp;ical 
knowledge, affording, of courfe, the beft of opportunities 
for improving the fcience of medicine. To make it ufeful 
in all thefe refpefts has been the ftudy of the prefent in- ' 
cumbent, and the public will judge of his fuccefs from the 
annexed tables. 

His fuccefs is very confpicuous in acute difeafes, but 
efpecially in fevers. What led to this fuccefs was *he fre- 
quent occurrence of that clafs of difeafes •, for other difeafes 
occurred only occafionally, but fevers eonftantly. The 

Vol. XIX. B b human

human body is liable to be affeded with many difeafes only 
once m life, but it may be, and often is, repeatedly affected 
wth fevers. The ftudy of fevers, therefore, engaged Dr 
Gordon's particular attention, and the numerous cafes which 
every day occurred, afforded ample fcope for obfervation. 

He was mortified to find, that the method of treatment 
commonly pradifed, and recommended by the moft cele- 
brated modern profejors, fo frequently failed of fuccefs; 
and that many more recovered, when left to the efforts of 
unallilted nature, than when treated according to the moft 
approved rules of art. He was therefore naturally led to 
entertain Xufpicions with refpeft to the propriety of thofe 
ruies ; and was foon convinced by obfervation and expe- 
riente, that it was impoffible for him to be fuccefsful in the 
treatment of fevers, without imitating the method by which 
nature cured them. For which purpofe he made it his bu- 
fmefs to pay particular attention to nature's operations and 
method of cure, in order that he might make that method 
the model of his pradice. And his practice, when thus re- 
gulated, was attended with great fuccefs, and enabled him 
to make fome very important difcoveries with regard to 
the nature and treatment of fevers. Thefe difcoveries he 
propofes to lay before the public, as foon as he has fulfilled 
his engagement to his pupils, who have urged him to pu- 
felifh a text-book, which he is preparing, and will foon have 
finifhed. 

The method which was found fo efficacious in the cure 
of fevers, was applied to many other acute difeafes upon the 
fame principles, and with fimilar fuccefs, as may be feen 
from a perufal of the tables already referred to. This lhftll 
alfo be laid before the public as fpeedily as poffible. 

At prefent,it mail only be obferved, that the general prin- 
ciple which pervades and guides tiie whole of his practice 
is to imitatp and follow the footfleps of nature, to make art 

fubfcrvient 



of Aberdeen, 



195 



fubfervient to nature, and theory to pra&amp;ice. This method 
is not new, though of late, too much neglected ; for the 
fame principle has been the guide of all great praBical phy- 
Jicians, both of ancient and modern times. And it is by 
this method only that the art of phyfic cam be improved 
and brought to perfeaion. It is not to be improved by hy- 
pothefes and ingenious theories formed in the clofet, but by 
obfervations accurately made in the chambers of the lick. 

The annexed tables are extracted from the records of the 
Difpenfary, which contain every patient's name, date of 
admiffion, age, refidence, difeafe, cure, or death, with the 
names of the recommenders j and all the recommendations 
are numbered, preferved, and prefented, along with the 
books, to a general meeting of the fubfcribers for examina- 
tion, by whofe orders the returns are annually printed, 
and difperfed among the citizens of Aberdeen. The re- 
turns of 1794 afford a melancholy proof of the power of 
.prejudice; for in that year 35, or more than half of the 
deaths were of the natural fmall-pox, notwithstanding Dr 
Gordon had given public notice of his readinefs to inocu- 
late gratis the children of the poor.

ManufaEture*. 

The principal manufacture ' of Aberdeen, prior to the 
year 174-5* was knitted (lockings, which were moftly ex- 
ported to Holland, and from thence difperfed through Ger- 
many. After that period the linen-manufacture was in- 
troduced, and brought to confiderable perfection. 

The fpinning of linen-yarn in this place, for manufac- 
tures, arofe from a fmall beginning. Some patriotic gentle- 
men, a few years after the battle of Culloden, being deli- 
rous to fpread thi3 ufeful art more extenlively in the 
northern diftrict, applied to the Board of Truftees at Edin- 
burgh, who fent a woman here qualified to inftruct others 
o. in

in the art of fpinning. She was accompanied with all the 
implements neceflary for her purpoie. As a proof that 
her exertions were crowned with fuccefs, it may be obfer- 
ved that the fpinning of linen-yarn has ariferi in this town 
to the extent of nearly 100,000 fpindles per a?mum. This 
is accomplilhed moflly by the wives and daughters of me- 
chanics and labourers, and procures them a yearly income of 
about L. 5000 Sterling. Much linen-yarn is beiides brought 
to Aberdeen from the country round to a coniiderable ex- 
tent. The quantity, however, of linen-cloth made here 
and in the neighbourhood is very fmall, owing, it is be- 
lieved, to the lrilh, who have engroffed the greater part of 
that branch of trade, both at the Englifh and foreign mar- 
kets, not on account of the fuperior quality of their goods, 
but of the encouragement given by their Parliament to the 
linen-manufacture, which enables them tounderfell us even 
in our own country. A confiderable quantity of the coar- 
fer kinds of this yarn is exported to Perth, Dunfermline, 
Glafgow, and other manufacturing places to the fouthward. 
Meflrs Collifon, Thomfon and Company, of this place, lately 
began the manufacture of brown meetings, ofnaburghs, and 
fail-cloths, and are the only manufacturers of fuch goods here. 
They have already, by unremitting attention, brought their 
brown, meeting and ofnaburghs, to as great perfection as 
any made in Scotland. Their fail-cloth manufactory only 
commenced in 1795, and what they have yet made has 
been fold to the fail-makers in this place, who acknowledge 
it equal in quality to the beft that comes from the fouth- 
country. The meetings and ofnaburghs are (hipped for 
London, and from thence are chiefly fent to the Weft In- 
dies and America. From the fatisfaaion thefe manufac- 
tures have given, they are greatly on the increafe, and bid 
f,ur to be carried to a coniiderable extent. The flax ufed 
in the linen branches here is chiefly imported from Hoi- 
VoL " XIX ' C c land,

land, and fome from England. But the Baltic flax is ufect 
for brown meetings, ofnaburghs, and other coarfe goods. 

Thread ManufaBure.— -In the article of thread, particu- 
larly white and coloured pound threads, the Scotch ftand 
unrivalled, and they muft maintain their fuperiority by 
local advantages, which no other country at prefent can 
poffefs, and the manufacture is carried on to an extent equal 
to any demand. Aberdeen exceeds in quantity that of any 
other town in Scotland ; and none have furpaffed, if they 
have yet come up to, their fabric in quality. All the 
threads made here are fent to the Engljfh market, and for 
the greateft part direct to London, and from thence to 
many different places abroad. Befides pound thread there 
is made here a confiderable quantity of the finer threads, 
called mnceot nun's thread, from their having been made 
by nuns in France and Flanders before the manufacture 
was introduced into this country. The principal thread- 
manufacturers in Aberdeen are, Milne, Cruden and Com- 
pany, for ftitching and ounce threads ; Leys, Mafibn and 
Company, for ftitching and coloured threads ; and Young 
and Walker, for coloured threads only. 

Thefe, with feveral lefs extenfive adventurers in the fame 
trade, and including a few who manufacture linen-yarn 
only, employ nearly 100 boys under 14 years of age, who 
earn each from is. 8d. to 2 s. 6d. a-week; 600 men, 
earning from 5 s. to 12 s. a-week each ; and not under 
2coo women, who have conftant employment, moftly in 
their own houfes, in fpinning yarn, doubling and twill- 
ing thread, &amp;c. Many women, who work within the ma- 
nufactures, will earn from 5 s. to 6 s. a-week ; but thole 
who work in their own houfes cannot earn nearly fo much, 
a confiderable part of their time being taken up with fa- 
mily matters, and other avocations. But additional to the 

1 perfons 



of Aberdeen. 



203 



perfons juft now mentioned, who dwell in the city andfub- 
urbs, the thread-manufaftures here give occanonally em- 
ployment to at leaft 10,000 women in this and other north- 
ern counties in fpinning linen-yarn. Their employment 
in fpinning for manufactures can only be called occafional, 
becaufe in fummer they are generally employed in pro- 
curing fuel, and fpinning wool and flax for family ufe. 
Their labour is alfo required in the field during harvea. 

Woollen Manufa&amp;ures, l?c.—ln the beginning of this 
century, the woollen manufactures of Aberdeenlhire were 
chiefly coarfe flight cloths, called plaidens and fingroms, 
which were fold from 5 d. to 8 d. per ell, and flockings 
from 8 d. to 3 s. 6 d. per pair. Thefe were manufactured, 
by the farmers and cottagers from the wool of their own 
meep, and by the citizens from the wool brought to the 
market from the higher parts of the country. The goods 
were bought up by the mercnan ts of Aberdeen, at a weekly 
market held in town, and at ftated periodical fairs held 
through the country, and which, in regard to manufac- 
ture, were under the regulation of the Dean of Guild of 
Aberdeen, who regularly attended, and who, being invert- 
ed with legal authority, confifcated fuch goods brought for 
fale, as were deficient in quality, lize, or meafure. The 
chief market for exportation was Hamburgh, from which 
place was brought over, at the public charge, and placed in 
a public warehoufe, a prefs or machine for packing of bale 
goods, by which 400 or 450 dozens of men's flockings may 
be put into a portable package ; but are made feldom to 
contain above 300 dozens, forming, when packed, an ob- 
long fquare, and meafuring about 50 cubic feet, and weigh- 
ing 15 cwt. grofs. 

Soon after the rebellion, anno 1745, a fpirit of agricul- 
tural improvement, as well as of commercial enterprize, 

took 



Statijlical Account 



took place. The firft had one effect, particularly in the 
low country, which will be qtte'frioned as an improvement. 
By obliging the farmer to winter-herding, he was difcou- 
raged from keeping a flock of fheep on his farm, on many 
of which, where large flocks were formerly kept, not one 
is now to be found. 

The fpirit of commerce happily faved the manufactures 
from the coafequential want of the raw material, which 
that fyftem of farming threatened. 

The woollen manufacture is now carried on more imme- 
diately by the merchant, who imports from London and 
Newcafile the raw wool, which he eatifes to be combed, 
and given out to the fpinfters and knitters throughout the 
country, from ftations in every partfh which they regularly 
attend, either weekly or monthly, as fuits belt with the 
circumftances of the place, or convenience of the manufac- 
turer. 

By this revolution in the woollen manufacture, a greater 
variety and better quality of goods are made, particularly 
of ftockings, which is now the principal article of the 
woollen export. 

The plaidens and fingroms, which were formerly the 
great ftaple articles, are now almoft quite out, and no more 
is exported than is fufficient for under-wrappers to the bales 
of ftockings. 

Several manufactures of coarfe cloths are fet on foot, but 
as the quantity made does not much exceed the demand for 
home confumption, a fmall quantity only is exported. 

The ftocking-manufacture is confiderably increafed. It 
is thought rather to exceed L. 100,000 Sterling annually, of 
which about two-thirds are fent to Holland and Germany, 
and one-third to England, Portugal, and America. 

Pne-fourth of the whole value may be reckoned to the 

raw 



of Aberdeen. 



raw material, fo that from L. 70,000 to L. 80,000 Sterling 
is laid out on labour for foreign confumpt. 

About. 400 perfons are employed in wool-combing, and 
3 o,coo occafionally employed in fpinning and knitting. It 
is faid occafionally employed, becaufe a great proportion of 
thefe are frequently otherwife occupied, particularly at har- 
vefl, at mofs, and in the fummer feafon, providing fome 
pieces of clothing for themfelves or families. 

The advantages peculiar to this branch of manufacture 
are, that children at the age of ten, and people very far ad- 
vanced in life, may, and often do, though in a fcanty mea- 
fure, maintain themfelves by their labour at this work, and 
the knitting can be carried on while travelling or watching 
cattle or the like ; nor does it require much, or at leaft not 
conftant light, many carrying on their work throughout 
the winter evening, with the fainteft light iffuing from a 
few turfs, — a circumftance much in favour of a country 
where the nights are long, and the inhabitants poorly fup- 
plied with fuel or light. From thefe circumftances, per- 
haps, it is, that the flocking manufacture finds hands, and 
has its work done at a dower rate than fome other 
branches of manufactures, a good knitter not being able to 
earn more than 2 s. per week, and the average not exceed- 
ing 1 s. 6 d. 

There are a few flocking-frames in Aberdeen, but no- 
thing confiderable is done in that way. 

When fpeaking of the extent of the flocking manufac- 
ture of A berdeenfhire, it mufl be underflood, that what is 
manufactured in the adjacent parts of the fhire of Meams, 
to the diflance of 12 or 15 miles on the coaft, is included, 
as all that trade centers in the city of Aberdeen, and is 
carried on by the merchants and manufacturers refiding 
there. 

The 



2 o6 Statijlical Account 

The wool ufed in the flocking-manufacture is brought 
from London and Newcaftle. The whole quantity of WO ol 
imported annually into Aberdeen is not lefs than 280. 
bags, of 240 lb. each. 

If the value of the ftockings exported is allowed to be 
L. 102,000, and the average price at the rate of 25 s. per 
dozen of mens ftockings, the quantity of wool confumed in 
that article will be 2500 bags : the foap confumed in warn- 
ing the wool and fcouring the ftockings will be about 37 
tons, and about 35 tons of oil ufed in combing the wool : 
So that there is expended in Aberdeenfliire, and part of 
the Mearns adjacent, on the manufacture of ftockings for 
foreign confumpt, yearly,

The fuppofed annual amount of ftockings for 
exportation, - - L. 103,000 o o 

It has been obferved, that 300 dozens of mens ftockings, 
when packed, weigh 1 5 cwt. and meafure about 50 cubic 
feet ; five feet go to a barrel bulk. The quantity manu- 
factured would therefore afford laftage for no more than 
five veffels of a hundred tons burden, and the wool and 
other materials ufed in the manufacture, cargoes for 13 
veffels of ti;e fame tonnage. 

Allowing the linen-yarn manufacture to be of the fame 
amount, it is prefumed the laftage is much the fame with 

the 



of Aberdeen. 



the woollen, but the material of the former would not afford 
laftage for above feven veflels of an hundred tons. Hence 
both thefe branches of manufafture, which form the prin. 
cipal ftaple articles of export from the port of Aberdeen, 
would only employ 30 veflels, or rather afford 30 cargoes 
for a veflel of that tonnage •, and hence it may be accounted 
for why the proportion of {hipping belonging to the port of 
Aberdeen is fo much inferior to places in Scotland of lefs 
trade and population. 

When it is faid above, that the ftocking-manufacture is 
of fuperior quality now to what it was formerly, it is to be 
underftood of the fabric in general : there were much high- 
er priced worfted ftockings made about 50 years ago than 
at prefent. They were the work of women of the better 
fort. We have heard of two or three guineas per pair ha- 
ving been paid; but there were but few of fuch quality 
knitted; and fuch, it is apprehended, were more for curio- 
fity than ufe, and the value more imaginary than real. 
There were, till of late, a good many made, which brought 
from 60 s. to 90 s. per dozen, and were both a neat and 
comfortable wear ; but the filk manufacture has leffened 
the demand for thefe at prefent, and they are only fought 
for by thofe who feek for convenience, rather than follow 
f ami on. 

In the year 1789, a water-mill was find erected near 
Aberdeen, with machinery for tearing, fcrubbling, carding, 
and rowing of wool, and jennies for fpinning the fame to ma- 
nufacture into cloth. Previous to this period the manufac- 
turer was obliged to import his warp-yarns from the north 
of England. The woft was chiefly fpun by old women, 
and that only from backings or nails, as they were not 
able to card the wool. 

While the manufacture of cloth was in this iituation, 

there 



208 



Statijlical Account 



there were not above 1500 ftones of wool manufactured in 
a year. But there has been manufaftured,

From ditto 1793 to ditto 1794, 5l6o 2800 
From ditto 1794 to ditto 1795, 597o 2350 

About half of the above wool comes from Northumber- 
land, a fmall part from London, and the reft is Scotch. 

The decreafe of the manufacturing of backings is owing 
to the ftocking-manufadturers of Aberdeen (from whom 
they were got) doing very little bufinefs fince the French 
over-ran Holland, which was the principal market for the 
woollen ftockings. 

The country people, 10 miles round Aberdeen, manu- 
fafture about 900 ftone a-year of Scotch wool, moftly for 
their own ufe. 

Cloths manufactured from the above wool are fix quar- 
ters broad duffles ; fix quarter broad blue milled cloths, at 
from 4 s. to 10 s. per yard; three quarters to yard broad 
feys, farges, fhafts, plaidings, baizes, linfeywoolfeys, jem- 
mies, and ftripped apron fluffs. The colours are chiefly 
dark and light blues, with a few mixtures and drabs. 

The above cloths are fold along the eaft coaft of Scot- 
land, betwixt Perth and Tain, and 20 miles up the country. 
A few of the broad cloths are fent to London and Ame- 
rica. 

The only inconvenience that the woollen-manufacturers 
in Aberdeen labour under is the want of weavers, particu- 
larly for broad cloths, which indeed is the only bar why 
they do not extend their manufacture of cloths, of the 
quality of the Yorkshire broads and Rachdale baizes, for 
exportation. 

Milling, 



of Aberdeen. 



209 



Milling, dying, and dreffing of cloth, is dene in the fame 
manner as at Leeds. 

At a period when the aids wanted by Government are 
fo confiderable, 'the Legiflature ought to do every thing to 
encourage and ftrengthen the manufaaures of the country. 
In 1782, Parliament granted a drawback of the duty of 
foap ufed in bleaching and cleaning linen and other goods. 
But a farther drawback is yet neceflary with refped to 
ajhes ufed in bleaching, which drawback, although very 
trifling to Government, would be of confequence to manu- 
facturers in many refpe&amp;s. The member of Parliament 
who will give himfejf the trouble to examine into the uti- 
lity of this drawback, and ftep forward to procure it, will 
deferve better of his country, than the man who, by a con- 
tinual oppofition to Government, endeavours to raife a 
» name to himfelf, by pretending to be the people's friend, 
The people's beft friend, is the man who contrives to fe- 
cure their property, and increafe their trade by unfettering

Statyiical Account 



Fijhery. — The falmon-fifhings at Aberdeen employ a 
confiderable number of men, and are attended with no fmall 
profit to the perfons concerned in them. They commence 
annually on .the nth of December, and end on the 19th 
of September. The fifhings on that part of the river Dee 
which belongs to the parifli of Old Machar, confift of feyen 
Cavels :

The other fifhings on the north fide of Dee belong pro- - 
perly to the parifh of St Nicholas, and are of great value. 
Thofe on the fouth fide of that river are in the parifh of 
Nigg, the ftatiftical hiftory of which contains an excellent 
account of the fifheries at this place and neighbourhood. 
The fifhing on the upper part of the north fide of the river 
Don, in Old Machar parifh, belongs to Mr Paton of Grand- 
home, and }s appropriated to the amufement of the pro- 
prietor, and of fuch Gentlemen as, by his permiflion, angle 
on that part of the river. Below that, all the way down 
to Seaton, the river on both fides belongs to the proprie- 
tors of the cruive fifhing. The cruives lie at Gordon's Mills. 
They are put into the river as foon as the weather will 
permit, after the commencement of the fifhing feafon, and 
taken out when it expires, that the falmon may get up the 
river to fpawn. The regulation of the cruives has occa- 
fioned perpetual difputes and law-pleas between the heri- 
tors on the upper parts of the river, and proprietors of that 
fifhing. To put an end to thefe contentions, the parties 
have entered into an agreement, by which the proprietors 



of Aberdeen. 



217 



of the cruive-iiftiing are allowed to regulate their cruives 
as they pleafe, on paying annually a Stipulated indemnity 
to the upper heritors, and this agreement is to laft for nine- 
teen years. Formerly the cruives would have let through 
fome fmall fifties, but now they will confine a trout of 1 lb. 
weight. Formerly they were left open from fix o'clock 
on Saturday night till about fun-riling on Monday morn- 
ing; but now they are kept constantly {hut. — The proprie- 
tors of the cruive-fifhing employ an overfeer, who is allow- 
ed a fuitable falary, and has under him, constantly three 
men, and occafionally feveral more. Their property is 
divided into eight fhares, which may be Separately bought 
or fold, or let. One perfon may hold one or more of thefe 
(hares. Some of them are at prefent let for L. 40 Sterling 
annually. Estimating each fhare at this rate, the annual 
rent of the whole fiftiing will amount to L. 320 Sterling. 
Moft of the fifh are caught, not in the cruives, but with nets 
below the cruive-dikes. The proprietors have a houfe at 
the cruives, in which they cure and keep their Salmon. 
They meet once every month during the fifliing-feafon, to 
■examine their books, to give directions to their Servants, 
and to regulate the other bufioefs of the fiftiing. 

Nearly oppofite to the houfe of Seaton, the Nether Don 
fifhing commences. It includes both fides of the river, and 
extends to the fea, comprehending a fmall part of the coaft 
on each fide of the river. The tide flows up the river 
nearly as far as this fiftiing extends. Some parts of the 
river can therefore be fifhed only in certain States of the 
tide. During feveral hours about the time of ]ow-water, 
while fome are fiftiing in the river, others are fifliing in the 
fea. The boats and nets with which they fifh upon the 
fea-coaft are larger, and require more men to work them, 
than thofe which are ufed on the river. This fiftiing is di- 
vided into two diftina properties, the one called the King's 

Vol. XIX. E e Cavel, 



2l8 



Statiflical Account 



Cavel, and the other the Bifhop's Cavel. In each cave! 
there are fix fhares called, Halfnets, and all the fcares are 
nearly of equal value. The proprietors of each cavel em- 
ploy an overfeer, who, in the beginning of the feafon, has 
eleven men under him, but after the ift of June, twenty 
men, and occafionally a greater number. Both the cavels. 
fifh alternately the fame water. It often happens, indeed, 
that both fifh in different places at the fame time. Very 
curious regulations are adopted by both cavels for fixing the 
periods at which they fucceed one another on the fea, and 
on the different fifhing Rations on the river. Thefe regula- 
tions have no connection with the Rated hours of the day 
and night, but are ingenioufly calculated, according to the 
ebbings and Rowings of the tide, to give both the cavels an 
equal chance for lilh. The produce of both properties 
are accordingly at the end of fome feafons very nearly 
equal. Such is the general principle on which thefe regu- 
lations are founded ; but they cannot be particularly ex- 
plained without an accurate map of the river, accompanied 
with a long and minute detail, which would be very unin- 
terefting to the public. Befides the fifh caught by their 
nets and boats, they fet fhort nets c-AleAfeeths in fome cor- 
ners of the river, and falmon are often found entangled in 
the mafhes of thefe nets. At the fouth end of Don Bridge 
the proprietors have houfes, in which they cure and keep 
their falmon till they are ready for exportation. They 
meet once every fortnight during the fifliing-feafon to fu- 
perintend their bufinefs, and give directions to their fer- 
vants. — None of the fhares of either cavel are let; it is 
therefore impoflible to fay with accuracy what rent this 
fifhing would yield. Its value is very great. A fingle 
fhare fold lately for L. 2500 Sterling. Eflimating each of 
the twelve fhares at this rate, the value of the whole fi fil- 
ing of both cavels would be L. 30,000 Sterling. 



The

The difadvantage by which this, and of confequence the 
cruive-fiftiing, is moft apt to fufter, arifes from the precarious 
ftate of the river's mouth. Many years ago, the liver near 
the fea took a long turn to the fouth, which rendered it fo 
mallow, that often the falmon could with difficulty enter it. 
The proprietors of the fifhings were anxious to deepen the 
mcutlrof the river,by making a ftraight cut through the fand- 
bank, at the turn of the river, between it and the fea. This 
was undertaken for a fmall fum of money by Dr Gregory, 
then one of the profeffors of King's College. He accord- 
ingly built a ftone bulwark, part of which is Rill extant, 
almoft. acrofs the old channel of the river, juft where it 
turned to the fouth. This cauftd the itream to pulh di- 
rectly, and with great force, againft the fand-bank, which 
lay immediately between it and the fea. Embracing an 
opportunity of a great flood in the river, he made a fmall 
cut acrofs the fand-bank, which the flood water foon entering, 
fwept away for itfelf an excellent channel directly into the 
fea. Having effected this important feivice to the Don 
fifhings at an expence confiderably below the flipulated 
fum, the Doctor generoufly gave the remainder of the mo- 
ney as a fund for the fupport of fuperannuated falmon- 
fithers, and fome of them now draw from that fund L. 2 
Sterling annually. — Though there is now little danger of 
the river refuming its old circuitous and lhallow courfe, as 
it ftill enters the fea through a large bed of foft fand, its 
mouth varies almoft every feafon, and often with every 
violent hurricane of wind. It is ftill fometimes fo fhallow 
at low water that no large fifties can enter it. The only 1 
method of deepening it, is by caufing it to run into the 
fea in as ftraight a Itream as poflible. For this purpofe, as 
its tendency is ftill to turn to the fouth, though at a place 
much nearer to the fea than its former winding, the pro- 
prietors of the fiftring have ereded a new bulwark of flakes

and heath, kept down with ftones, in an oblique direftion, on 
the fouth fide of the river, a good way into the channel, 
inis feems already to have good effete, by turning the 
ilream to the north, and deepening the river's mouth. It is 
daily gaining additional ftrength, becaufe the weather is 
driving the fand clofe behind, and thereby fupporting it. 

The falmon in Dee and Don are thought to be in the 
higheft perfeftion in April and May. For feveral years 
pan they have not been fold here at any time under 3 d. 
per pound ; and until the beginning of July, when the an- 
nual contrad of the proprietors of the fifhings with the 
Aberdeen merchants, who fend the falmon to the London 
market, expires, none are to be had under 6 d. per pound. 
To obtain them even at this price we muft fend to the 
boil-houfe in Aberdeen. It is hard, that while our rivers 
abound in fifh, their whole produce mould, for five or fix 
months in the year, be fold to one or two Aberdeen mer- 
chants, at about 4 d. or even under that fum, and that, du- 
ring that period, none of the inhabitants can obtain a fingle 
pound under 6 d. and that only in the way of favour from 
the merchants. LaftVyear our falmon were felling in tha 
London market cheaper than we could buy them at Aber- 
deen. Was not this carrying on a monopoly at once to 
the difadvantage of the merchants and the country ? It has 
been alleged, that the proprietors of the Biftiop's Cave! 
were once obliged to offer their fifh for fale in the market 
of Old Aberdeen. If ever this commendable pra&amp;ice took 
place, it has long ago fallen into difufe. Two thirds of the 
produce go to the London market ; and the catch of July, 
Auguft', and September, is falted, and exported in barrels to 
France and Flanders, where they have a character fuperior 
to the fifh of other rivers, which occafions a difference of 
price at home of ios. to 15 s.pe'r barrel, From 120 to 150

filhermen are employed on the rivers. Their wages, at an 
average, are from L. 5 to L. 15 per annum. 

The grilfes come into our rivers about the middle or end 
of June, and continue till September. Thefe may gene- 
rally be bought at about 2 d. or about 2^d. per pound.— 
The fifh caught in July, Auguft, and September, are faked 
and exported. 

The white trout and finnocks caught in the falmon-fimers 
nets are excellent. They belong as a perquifite to the fiftier- 
men, by whom they are fold at about 2 d. per pound, and 
fometime3 at a lower rate, to the inhabitants of both the 
town and neighbourhood. Many finnocks are caught in 
the Don by fmall feeths, which the fifhermen fet for that 
purpofe after the feafon of the falmon-fifliing is over. It 
is thought that thefe feeths do not tend to prevent the fal- 
mon from coming up the river to fpawn, becaufe they are 
too fmall in the mafhes for entangling large fifties, and be- 
caufe they are never fo far extended into the river as to 
hinder them from palling. 

Nail Manufacture. — The chief branch of the iron manu- 
facture carried on here is the making of nails. This work 
was eftablifhed about the year 1780, and employs from 20 
to 30 hands, who earn very high wages. Other branches 
of the iron manufacture might now, that the coal-duty is 
taken off, be carried on here to advantage. 

Dijlilleries. — The fmall ftills in Aberdeen and its neigh- 
bourhood were lately either given up, or removed to the 
Highland diftri&amp;s. All the whilky made in fuch ftills is 
liable to be Teized as fmuggled goods when brought to 
Aberdeen ; fo that the city depends entirely on the large 
diftilleries in the fouth of Scotland for fupplies of whilky. 

The

Statijlical Account 



The quantity imported before the late prohibitory drilling 
aft was great, and iii general of a very bad quality. 

A diftillery, on a pretty extenfive fcaJe, was lately erect- 
ed near Aberdeen ; it was completed on the 29th Septem- 
ber 1794. It is fituated near Don Bridge. The chief in- 
ducement for ere&amp;ing it there was the command of water, 
38 feet perpendicular upon the banks of a navigable river. 
It was intended to diftil annually the produce of 12,000 
quarters of com* but could do much more. This feafon, 
(1795 ), owing to obftruclions from the feverity of the 
weather during the laft winter and fpring, the embargo, 
and the prohibition, only 8215 quarters were brewed, pay- 
ing upon importation to London L. 26,800 Sterling, with 
about L. 1000 more for duty upon malt. The principal 
part of the corn grevv in Aberdeenfliire ; the reft was im- 
ported from the adjacent diftri&amp;s. The whole was the 
growth of Scotland. 

It would be of great public utility if diftilleries upon a 
moderate fcale were erecled in different counties through- 
out the united kingdoms, inftead of being concentered in 
and near London, in ten great houfes. Moft of the fpent 
wafh or burnt ale, and much of the dung, is thrown into the 
river, which, befides injuring the water, is a lofs to fociety. 
More cattle and hogs would be fed, and all damaged or ill- 
harvefted corn, unfit for exportation, would be turned to 
the utmoft advantage ; the manure would enrich the lands 
contiguous. This diftillery would well keep at the rate of 
400 -cattle, or 1000 hogs, yielding fufricient manure to ferti- 
lize annually from 15 to 20 Scotch acres, of the moft bar- 
ren land ; but call it at a medium 20 Engliih acres, as the 
contents of the wafli-ftill here amounts only to 2650 gal- 
lons, every 100 gallons ought to manure nearly one V ing.- 
lifh acre ; and confequently the London diftilleries, whofc 

wafh 



of Aberdeen, 



wafh-ftills are at leaft 100,000 gallons in contents, ought to 
fertilise 1000 acres per annum. 

Throwing away the bottoms, as they are called, is a great 
public lofs.— Suppofe a houfe to brew daily 100 quarters, 
this would produce about 10,000 gallons of worts or wafh, 
or 100 gallons from a quarter *. When the fermentation 
ceafes, the wafh is fit for diftillation •, about one-tenth, or 
1000 gallons, of which will be a thick fediment or bottom* 
which in England is frequently thrown into the river, in 
the prefence of the officers of excife, thereby faving the 
duty of 9 d. per gallon, and avoiding the danger of burning 
the ftill. In Scotland it is thrown away to avoid the burn- 
ing only. It could eafily be proved how much corn is thus 
totally loft annually ; it is probable full 50,000 quarters. 
This muft be the cafe until the Legislature make it the in- 
tereft of the corn-diftiller to extract all the fpirit in and 
from the corn, without running the rilk of burning the 
ftill. 

In this diftillery, half barley and half bear are made ufe 
of j unquestionably there is more farina, or faccharine mat- 
ter, in barley than in bear, and it is that only which produ- 
ces fpirit. Potatoes are lefs fit for diftillation than barley ; 
the fpirit produced is much fouler ; and it is not believed 
that they would anfwer upon a large fcale. Rye may 
be ufed to advantage with malt and barley, but it muft 
be in a fmall proportion. All barley ufed by diftil- 
lers would be malted if there were no duty upon malt,- be- 

caufe 

* To prevent throwing aivay the bottoms, — two methods only appear 
eligible : Diftillers to be allowed a ftill of fuitable or proportionate gal- 
lons, under proper regulations, for extracting the fpirit from the bottoms, 
without being obliged, as now, either to throw them away, or mix and diftil 
them with the wafh. Or, to be allowed a proper number of hours to 
work their ftills off, lefs rapidly than they are now obliged to do. The 
(fivft appears by far the molt eligible.

caufe ioo grains of malt will yield more faccharine matter 
than ioo grains of barley, but it occupies more fpace; it is 
the intereft of the diftiller at prefent to ufe as much raw 
grain as poffible, faving thereby the duty on the malt ; and 
it is certain, that the grains or refufe for feeding the cattle 
or hogs is the better the lefs fpirit that is taken out of it : 
As the fpirit extracted, however, would be much finer and 
wholefomer, and as it could not poffibly, under proper re- 
gulations, be attended with any lofe to the revenue, it may 
be worthythe consideration of Parliament, whether it would 
not be advifeable to enact, that in future fpirits fhould be 
extracted from malted grain alone. 

Breweries* — The firft public brewery, for brewing ale 
for the confumpt of this town, was ere&amp;ed by Meffrs Wil- 
liam Black and Company about the year 1768. Their 
work is very confidevable, and there is fcarce any thing of 
the kind in Scotland fo complete. They brew table-beer, 
ftrong-ale and porter. Their ftrong-ale is of fuch excellent 
quality, that a great deal of it is fent to London, and feve- 
ral places abroad ; and their porter is generally fuperior in 
quality to the London porter which is brought here for 
fale ; but fuch is the effect of prejudice, that people will 
drink London porter of the worft kind, before good frelh 
porter brewed at home. 

There are now, befides Meffrs William Black and Com- 
pany's brewery, no fewer than fix public breweries in this 
town and parilh of Old Machar. Two of them in town, 
Meffrs George Annand and Company, and Meffrs Brebner, 
Gibbon and Company, do a great deal of bufinefs, and 
they are all in a thriving way. 

Before there were any public breweries in this place, the 
people who kept public- houfes brewed all the ale and beer 
which they fold ; and it ,was then cuftomary for private fa- 
milies 



of Aberdeen, 



225 



in Hies to brew for their own iife, but private, brewing is 
now laid afide. 

Cotton-Cloth Manufacture, ifc— There is carried on by 
fome gentlemen in this town a very eXtenfive manufacture 
in fpinning, weaving, and printing cotton-cloth in the 
greateft variety of patterns. The primfield and work- 
houfes, where this manufacture is principally carried on, 
lie in the parilh of Old Machar. This work has added 
confidcrably to the population of the town and neighbour- 
hood. 

Price 6f Proviftons, i$c — The price of beef and mutton 
about 4 d. per lib. ; veal, 5 d. ; pork, 3^ d. ; geefe, i s. 6 d. 
each ; ducks, is. 8 d. per pair ; butter, 8 d. per lib. or 28 
ounces; cheefe, 5s. per Hone, or 28 pounds; chickens, 
10 d. per pair. 

The wages of a labourer ^er day are from iod. to 1 s. 4 d. ; 
a carpenter, bricklayer, or maibn, has 1 4. 6 d. a-day, and a 
Wright commonly 13.3 d. The wages of a female fervant 
is commonly about L. 1, 10 s. and for a male-fervant from 
L. 4 to L. 5 in the half-year. 

The moft memorable battle in this neighbourhood was 
that which was fought, in the laft century, between Mont- 
rofe arid the Covenanters, on Friday the 13th of Septem- 
ber 1644, in which victory declared for the former, and 
the Later were purf.ed with great (laughter from the field 
of battle, which was about a mile weftward to the town. 
A gentle-man of this place, proprietor of fome giound in 
the Schoolhill, which had been time immemorial employed 
as garden-ground, intending to build on it, dug pretty deep 
for a foundation, when, to his great forpHfc, he came on a 
place in which there were found many human bones, and 
among them 14 or 16 fculls. What is very remarkable is, 
Vol. XIX. Ff ^ 



Statiftical Account 



that on fome of the fculls there was found long yellow 
hair, neatly wrapped round and plaited with an woollen 
fillet or firing in form of a queue, which did not appear to 
be rotten. As there were no remains of any coffin, and in- 
deed no appearance from the pofition of the bones that the 
bodies had been regularly interred, and as this field is at the 
weft end of the town, exaflly in the line of the purfuit from 
the field of battle, it is conjectured, that on that occafion 
the bodies of many, who had fallen near the place, had been 
huddled together, and promifcuoufly thrown into this clay 
pit, for fuch it appeared to have been. It was on that oc- 
cafion that Montrofe gave up the town to the pillage of the 
foldiers, who were moftly Irifh, and cruelly mafTacred many 
of the harmlefs inhabitants, infomuch, that the women only 
durft appear, and take concern in burying the dead. It is 
about twenty years fince the difcovery of thefe fculls and 
other human bones was made. 

Intended Canal. — There are at prefent no navigable ca- 
nals in this place, unlefs the lead at the printfield is confi- 
dered as one^ and it has been ufed as fuch, only for bring- 
ing flones from a quarry to the buildings of the manufac- 
ture. A fubfcription has been raifed to obtain a furvey of 
a canal from Aberdeen, up Don fide to Monymufk, with a 
branch up the water of Ury, through the Garioch, to Infch. 
The furvey is made by Captain George Taylor, and the 
undertaking found to be practicable. A fmall cut, twenty 
feet wide, by three feet and a half deep, is intended to 
carry boats of twenty or thirty tons burden. The locks 
and bridges will be fewer, and lefs expenfive than raoft 
people acquainted with the grounds are apt to fuppofe. The 
expence is within reach of the gentlemen proprietors of 
the lands adjacent. The quantity of goods now carried by 
land is fufficient to pay a reafonable intereft for the money 

required, 



of Aberdeen.

required, at little more than half the expence of land-car- 
riage. So favourable is the fpirit of the people to this un- 
dertaking, and fo evident its advantages to the public, that 
many farmers propofe to fubferibe for fhares. The canal 
will pafs for three miles through the parifh of Old Machar, 
from the harbour of Aberdeen, and communicate with 
Gordon's mills field, the printfield, and Parfley bleachfield, 
the moft extenfive manufadures in this part of the country. 

The benefit which the manufacturers cm the banks of 
Don, both in this parifli and the parifh of Newhills, would 
reap from this canal, muft indeed be great ; both by 
the cheap carriage of coals, and all the heavy and bulky 
articles ufed in their feveral branches, to their manufac- 
tures, and by the eafy conveyance of their goods to Aber- 
deen, on the arrival of which in a given time they might 
fecurely depend. As there are many fine haughs and wa- 
ter-falls along the Don, and adjacent to the courfe of the 
intended canal, it may in time be the means of efta'bliihing 
ufeful manufactures at a confiderable diftance from the 
town, where the immenfe expence of fire and carriage 
renders fuch undertakings at prefent impracticable. But 
its beneficial influence on agriculture will be more inftan- 
taneoufly confpicuous. Almoft the whole labour of the 
farmers, and of their fervants and horfes, from feed-time to 
harvefi, is employed in digging, drying, and carrying home, 
peats and turf for their winter-fuel. This, by difeburaging 
the carriage of lime and other manure, and by putting it 
out of their power to attend properly to green crops and 
fallow, has exceedingly retarded the improvement of the 
lands at a diftance from the town. By means of the canal, 
every farmer along the banks, and to the diftance of two 
or three miles from thefe, might, at a cheap rate, and in a 
few days, lay in his winter-fuel of coals, and have abun- 
dant leifure to attend to thej.mprovement of his land. It 

would 



228 Stati/lical Account 

Would alfo afford him a cheap, eafy, and expeditious con. 
\eyance of li ne and ocher manure from Aberdeen, while a 
fingle fervant could, at comparatively little expence, attend 
his grain, meal, poultry, butter, clieefe, milk, and all the 
produce of his farm, to market, in doing which he mull at 
prefent employ many hories and carts. It would thus re- 
dound to the advantage of the proprietors of the adjacent; 
lands, not only by fertilizing their foil, extending their 
arable lancji, and" increaling their rents; but alfo by en- 
abling them to open with profit many quarries of excellent 
granite, fo.ne of lime and fome of flate, which, on account 
of the expence of the carriage to town, are as yet unwrought. 
Bv furmihing a cheap and expeditious conveyance to mar- 
ket for the wood of many fine and extenfive plantations 
adjacent to its courfe, and which, for want of inch convey- 
ance, cannot now be fold to advantage, it would greatly 
increafe the value of thefe plantations, and encourage their 
owners to extend them over many large tracks of other- 
wife bleak, barren, and unproductive ground. Thus would 
it tend at once to increafe population, to enrich both the 
landholder and the tenant, and to beautify the face of the 
country. 

This place gave birth to Mr George Jamie/on, a portrait- 
palter of the molt dilUnguimed eminence. He was born 
pf rt'lpe&amp;able parents about the end of the 16th century, 
H iving, at an early period of life, difcovered an uncom- 
mon genius for portrait-painting, he went abroad, and flu- 
died under the celebrated Reubens, during which time he 
rnade great progrefs in his profeflion. About he year 
1620 he returned to his native city, waere he let ed ; s a 
portrait-painter, and afterwards married, an Aberdeen lady 
of the name of Ifobel Toafl), by whom e had feveral 
children both fons and d?.ughre It ap .eais that all his 
ions died when young. Kis only d.ug.ter ^hofe defend-

was Mr Burnet of Elrick, in the county of Aberdeen. She 
was afterwards married to Mr James Gregory, the eminent 
mathematician, and profeffor of mathematics in the Uni- 
verfmesofSt Andrew's and Edinburgh, and great grand- 
father of Dr James Gregory, prefent profeffor of medicine, 
Univerfity, Edinburgh. Her third marriage was to Bailie 
George Eddie of Aberdeen. By all of them {he had chil- 
dren. Many of the defcendants of the two firft have nume- 
rous families in this county. She appears to have inherited 
a confiderable portion of her father's genius for portrait-re- 
prefentation, chiefly on tapeftry, many fpecimens of which 
Hill remain, particularly feveral large Scripture pieces, in 
different compartments, which now decorate a part of the 
High Church of Aberdeen. 

Jamiefon's character and ftyle of painting foon became 
generally known and admired all over the kingdom. He 
■ appears (as may be feen in the fubjoined lift) to have paint- 
ed a great number of portraits, among which are King 
James VI. and Charles I. It is faid, that when taking the 
portrait of Charles I. the King ordered him to keep on his 
hat. Owing to this circumftance, or perhaps in imitation of 
Reubens his mafter, in all the pictures of himfelf he is re- 
prefented with his hat on. 

Mr John Alexander, grand-nephew of Mr Jamiefon, 
feems to have been the only one of his defcendants who 
poffeffed his genius for painting. He practifed in Aber- 
deen as a portrait-painter till a confiderable time after the 
year 1730. Many of his paintings alfo are highly efteemed. 

George Jamiefon was a nephew of David Anderfon of 
Finzeauch, merch nt- urgefs of Aberdeen. He was com- 
monly called, Davie do a' thing, on account of his very 
great and extenfiye genius for mechanics, and moft other 
I branches 



23° 



Statiftical Account 



branches of natural philofophj, which he eminently dif- 
played in many different inftances at Aberdeen. 

Mr Anderfon was born about the 1575, and married to- 
wards the end of that century, to Jean Guild, daughter of 
Matthew Guild, burgefs of Aberdeen, by whom he had 
feveral children, particularly three daughters, all married to 
different gentlemen in the town and county of Aberdeen. 

After his death, his widow, Jean Guild, with the con- 
currence and approbation of her daughters and their huf- 
bands, mortified the greateft part of a confiderable property 
of her own, for the maintenance often poor orphans, at the 
rate of 50 merks yearly to each, under the patronage of the 
Magiftrates and Town-council of Aberdeen. Her brother, 
Dr William Guild, Principal of King's College, alfo de- 
fined a confiderable fum of money for the like pious pur- 
pofe, and under the fame patronage ; from the produce of 
which, and the great improvements and attention which 
have been made and bellowed upon them by the patrons, 
about 40 neceffkous orphans are at prefent in a great mea- 
fure fupported in the town of Aberdeen, and which they 
are entitled to enjoy from their earlieft infancy till they 
become 16 years of age.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q582452">ALNESS</name>, 

(County and Synod of Ross, and Presbytery 0* 

Dingwall). 

By the Rev. Mr Angus Bethune, Minifier.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

ALNESS lignifies the Promontory, a headland of the 
brook, or river, being compounded of the words 
Auilt, brook, or Amhain, river, and Nefs, a headland, which 
is the termination of many names of places where there is 
a headland or promontory. The name correfponds with 
the fituation of the parifli, which ftretches along a river, 
formerly called Averon r but now known by the name of 
the Water of Alnefs r and terminates in a narrow point or 
promontory. 

Situation, Extent, Soil and Produce. — The parifli is fitu- 
afed in the county of Rofe, and belongs to the pre/by tery 
of Dingwall and Synod of Rofs. It is of a very irregular 

form* 



of Alnefs.

form ; in fome parts not above two miles, and in others 
more than four miles broad. It is 12 miles long, extending 
from Alnefs point, on the fhore of the frith of Cromarty, 
its fouth-eaft boundary, a confiderable way into the more 
highland parts of the country. In the lower part of the 
parifli, lying contiguous to the fea, and about two miles up- 
wards, the ground is moftly arable, and of various qualities. 
The foil, however, is generally light, and though it feldom 
produces luxuriant crops, yet when the farmers are induf- 
trious, their labour is rewarded by a middling return of 
oats, barley, and peafe, and abundant crops of potatoes ; 
and there can be little doubt, if the farms, which are almoft 
all open-field, were iaclofed, and a different mode of farm- 
ing adopted from that generally prattifed in this part of 
the country, but the foil would produce at leaft a third 
more grain than it does at prefent. The higher parts of 
the parifh, lying beyond a ridge of hills which conceals 
them from the eye of the traveller on the public road, con- 
iift of ftraths or glens, producing fome bear and black, oats, 
but chiefly adapted for pafturage, and in which a confider- 
able number of black cattle, and fome fmall horfes, are 
reared. Adjoining to thefe ftraths are two beautiful frefh- 
water lochs or lakes, which have a pleafant efFe£l to the 
eye, and abound with a variety of trout. Each loch is 
about two miles long, and nearly a mile broad. Higher up 
the country, and beyond thefe lochs, is a very extenlive 
traft of rich heath, affording pafture in the fummer time, 
not only to the graziers in the braes, but for the oxen and 
young {lore of the farmers in the lower part of the parifh 
and neighbourhood, who, not having fufficient pafture of 
their own, muft fend their cattle to feed for the fummer 
months to thefe grazings. 

Sheep-farming has been lately introduced on thefe higher 
grounds, extended heaths, and fome of the glens ; but the 

plan, 



Statijlical Account 



plan, however juftifiable in itfelf, and on the part of th6 
proprietors, was unpopular, becaufe it occafioned the remo- 
val of the native poffeffors of thefe farms and grazings, and 
excited a diforderly and tumultuous fpirit among the cdun- 
try-pecple, which it became neceffary by legal and for- 
cible means to fupprefs. This gave rife and rapid circula- 
tion to a report, as injurious as it was' groundlefs, that the 
proprietors treated thefe poor tenants with oppreffion and 
cruelty. In juftice, however, to the proprietors ot this pa- 
rifh, who have let any part of their eftates for fheep-farm- 
ing, it is proper to allure the public, that fuch tenants as 
had been removed from their poffeffions for that purpofe, 
were otlierwife provided in farms by thefe gentlemen, ei- 
ther on their own eftates, or on fome others in their vici- 
nity ; and that to this humane object they paid every at- 
tention in their power, feeling themfelves particularly inte- 
refted in, and folicitous for, the accommodation of the few 
tenants whom, with a view to encourage the introduction 
of fheep-farming, they had found it neceffary to remove. 

H r ritors of the Pariflj. — The proprietors of the pariih 
are General Sir Hector Munro of Novar, K. B. Captain 
Duncan Munro of Culcairn, Captain Hugh Munro of Tea- 
ninich, Mifs Mackenzie of Inchcoulta, and Andrew Munro 
of Lealdie. Of thefe, ' General Sir He&amp;or Munro and 
Captain Hugh Munro of Teaninich have their family-feats, 
and are refident in the pariih. 

The place and family-feat of Novar has been highly cul- 
tivated and improved by Sir Hector Munro, at a very 
great expence, and with much and approved tafte. It is 
indeed a great and a finiflied place, the moft complete in 
the north, and the admiration of all travellers to this coun- 
try. It is, too, very advantageoufly lituated, conuderably 
elevated above the frith, not a mile diftant from it, and 

commanding

-commanding a full and extenfive view of the neighbouring 
country, and of the bayd headland of Cromarty ,-ob- 
jeds greatly admired for their lingular beauty. 

Valuation and Rent. -The valued rent of the parifh is 
L. 2891 Scots, and the real rent about L. 1200 Sterling. 
The rent has not been much increafed of late, fheep-farms 
excepted, which have been confiderably augmented. No 
additional rent has been laid on the tenants of Novar eftate 
fince it came into the poffemon of Sir Hedor Munro, nor 
for fome time before that period. A laudable example to 
other proprietors, and highly deferving of imitation, and a 
certain method of fecuring the inviolable attachment and 
affection of the tenants. 

Population.— -The number of perfons now living in this 
parifh is 112 1; of thefe, 800 are examinable, or above fe- 
ven years of age.

Previous to the admiffion and fettlement of the prefent 
incumbent, which took place in September 177 », the mi- 
nifters of this parifh fince the Revolution were, Mr John 
Frafer, Mr Daniel Mackilligan, and Mr James Frafer, all 
worthy and excellent men, and fuccefsful preachers of the 
Gofpel. The laft, in particular, was a clergyman of pro-

found erudition as well as piety, and diftingui/hed for great 
ability and acutenefs in facred criticifm. S 

State of tie Church, &amp;_ The church ^ 
jears ago and neatly finilhed. It ffifl continues to be a 
decent and comfortable place of worfhip. A new manfe, 

built two years ago; and fo cordially were the heritors 
difpofed to grant fuch good accommodation, that no appli- 
cation was made to the prefibytery for their interpofidon. 
The fhpend is 128 bolls of vidual, L.36, 10 s. Sterling in 
money, with an allowance of L. S Sterling for communion- 
elements ; and as the minifter feels, fo he cannot help ex . 
preffing, much gratitude to all the heritors, who, far from 
oppofing his getting an augmentation of ftipeud, voluntarily 
concurred in his application t 0 the Court of Teinds. 

State of the Poor.— The number of poor upon the roll 
of the parifli is confiderable, being above 70 perfons. The 
fund for their partial fupport and relief arifes from the 
weekly colleaions, which will amount to about L. 20 Ster- 
lings annum, and the intereft of L. 124, a late donation 
by pious perfons connected with the parifh. Since the 
year 1774, General Sir Hettor Munro of Novar has order- 
ed a very liberal and charitable bounty of 12 bolls oat-meal 
to be annually diftributed among the poor of the parifli, 
which frequently proves a very feafonable fupply * ; and 
it is owing to the Hated and exemplary attendance of the 
refiding heritors on public worlhip, that the weekly col- 
lections amount to the fum already mentioned, which is far 
fuperior to the collections of neighbouring country parilhes. 
One inftance this of the many happy effects, ofVhich the

regular attendance of the higher ranks, on the facred infti- 
tutions of religion, would be produ&amp;ive. 

Schools. — There are three fchools in the parifh. A pa- 
rochial fchool near the church, in which 60 children are 
ufually taught. The fchoolmafter's falary is 200 merks 
Scots; but his income, including his appointments of fef- 
fion -clerk and precentor, together with the emoluments of 
the fchool, will be above L. 20 Sterling. In the higher 
parts of the parifh, there are two fchools eftablimed by the 
Honourable the Society in Scotland for Propagating Chri- 
ftian Knowledge •, one for inflrudting ' children in reading, 
writing, and arithmetic, and another for teaching young 
girls fpinning, fewing, and knitting ftockings. In both, 
there are above 60 boys and girls generally taught. 

Ores. — On the property of Andrew Munro of Lealdie 
has been difcovered an iron ore, which, from appearances, 
feems to be of conliderable extent. It is alfo of a rich qua- 
lity. A fample of it, which has been fent to the Carron 
Company, at their own defire, produced 75 lb. iron per 
cwt. The rock is of eafy accefs, but is three miles diftant 
from the fhore. It may, however, at fome future time, 
become a fource of conliderable benefit to the proprietor. 

Chara&amp;er of the People. — The people are naturally judi- 
cious and acute, poffeffing conliderable vigour of mental 
faculties. They are alfo, on the whole, induftrious and 
fober, and, with a few exceptions, of good morals. They 
abftain carefully from profane fwearing^ and rarely utter 
an oath. To the Sabbath they pay a facred regard ; many 
of them are devoutly difpofed, and feem to feel deep im- 
preflions of religion on their hearts. They all belong to 
the Eftablimed Church, and difcover no particular propen- 
fity to fanatical fe&amp;arifm. It muft be confcffed, however, 

that

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q165845">STORNOWAY</name>, 

(County of Ross, Synod of Glenelg, Presbytery 

of Lewis). 

By the Rev. Mr Colin Mackenzie.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent* 

STornoway, or Stronevaidh, is fo called from its being 
fituated on the nofe or point of a bay. The inhabited 
parts of this parifh may refemble the figure of a triangle, 
one fide of which extends ten miles north-eaft, along the 
north fide of an arm of the fea, called the Broad Bay, and 
another along a neck of land, inhabited on each fide, ex- 
tending feven miles, and fituated betwixt the fouth-eaft fide 
of the Broad Bay and the channel which divides it from 
the continent. It is fituated in the ifland of the Lewis, 
county of Rofs, within the bounds of the Synod of Glen- 
elg, and prefbytery of Lewis. It is bounded on the weft 
by the parifh of Barvas from which it is divided by a tra6t 
of ten computed miles of mofs or wafte moor; on the

on the fou h, by the channel and the river Creed, which 
divides it from the parifh of Lochs. It confifts of three di- 
finds, namely, Stornoway, Ui, and Grefs. At the head 
of this triangle ftands the well-known village of Stornoway, 
^hofc origin is very old, and, like other towns, from a 
mall beginning, is now arrived to fome diftindion and uti- 
lity. On an elevated fituation on the other fide of the bay, 
near and oppofite to the town, is built Seaforth Lodge, for 
the reception and accommodation of Seaforth, the proprie- 
tor of this ifland, when he chofe to come and vifit this part 
pf his eftate, and where the prefent proprietor, Colonel 
Francis Humberftone Mackenzie, a gentleman univerfally 
Jcnown for benevolence and &amp; public fpirit, did refide for 
fome years with his family ; who, with his lady, when here, 
took pleafure in directing and fuperin tending their people 
to habits of induftry and happinefs, until he was called a- 
way, at the commencement of the prefent war, to ferve his 
King and country, by raifing two battalions of infantry for 
Government. This manfion is delightfully fituated, and 
commands an extenfive view both of fea and land. 

Stornoway is furnifhed with an excellent and well-fre- 
quented harbour, where veflels of every defcription may 
anchor with fafety*. The attention and induftry of its prin- 
cipal inhabitants are chiefly direded to fifhing of herrings, 
of which, in fuccefsful years, they take fome thoufand bar- 
rels, and have about thirty-five veflels from 20 to 80 tons 
burden, annually fitted for the bounty at a great expence, 
and by the profits arifing from them they are chiefly fup- 
pprted. Jn fome late years notwithstanding, their utmoft 
endeavours have been almoft wholly fruftrated by the fail- 
ing of the fifliing i of confequence, they mull be great fuf- 
ferers by their adventures in this bufinefs, as the bounty- 
money will not defray their expence. The houfes are built

at a confiderable coft, becaufe all the materials are import- 
ed, the ftones hot excepted, and therefore fuch as we va- 
cant muft be fet to tenants for higher rent than m raoft 
other places. Good houfes are let at from L. 15 to L. 25 
per annum, and rooms and leffer dwellings in like propor- 
tion. Some of the land about the town is let for 36 s. per 
acre yearly. 

Schools — There ate two well-frequehted fchools in the 
town, provided with able teachers, good accommodation, 
and good falaries. The one is parochial, and the other is 
fupported by the Society for Propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge. The yearly falary of the parochial fchool is L. 40, 
of which the mafter has L. 25, and his affiftant L. 15. The 
mafter has, together with the emoluments of his fchool, a 
dwelling-houfe and garden rent-free, and fome land from 
the proprietor. The fees are, per quarter, for Engiifh and 
writing, 2 s. 6 d. ; for arithmetic and Engiifh, 3 s.; for 
Latin, writing, arithmetic together, 4 s. ; for a courfe df 
geography, 1 os. 6d. ; for navigation, L.I, is.; and for 
each fet of book keeping, 10 s. 6 d. The number of fcho- 
lars is 40. The Society fchool mailer's dwelling-houfe and 
fchool-houfe are lately built with ftone and lime, and cover- 1 
ed with Hate at Seaforth's expence. The falary is L. 17 to 
the mafter, and L. 8 to his affiftant. The quarter- fees are, 
for reading, 1 s. 6 d. ; writing, 2 s. •, arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d. -, 
book-keeping, 5 s.; menfuration, 5 s.; navigation, 10 s. 
The number of fcholars is 129. 

Befides thefe, there is a fpinning-fchool eftablifhed by the 
Society ; the accommodation confifting of a garden and a 
flated houfe, with L. 6 falary granted by Seaforth, and L. 4 
falary from the Society, to the miftrefs. To this fchool, 
and two others of the fame kind, ere&amp;ed in this parifh, but

it was found neceffary that it mould fail oftener for , the

new one purchafed, which goes weekly for the mail, the 
expence whereof annually amounts to L. 130, of which L. 7 o

Seaforth, except what is collected by the freights of paffen-

of portages charged from the General Port-office at Edin-

working at road-making, and other labour, at 8 d. a-day. 
By thefe means, and the produce of their lands, they are 
enabled to pay their rents, and procure a tolerable fubfift- 
ence.-The foil is of different kinds, fome fandy, W 
moffy fume black rich foil, and fome light gravel, alllying 
on a hard clay bottom, fo very impenetrable, that a pike 
will fcarcely pierce it. Rain can with difficulty enter into 
it, but remains mixed with the foil, or runs over the fur- 
face till it be dried up in the fpring feafon by the influence 
of the fun and wind. To this caufe, and the frequent hea- 
vy rains, may be attributed the uncommon wetnefs and 
coldnefs of the foil of this ifland, and the late fpring and 
harveft. The plough made ufe of in general is an awk- 
ward mftrument, not unlike the Chinefe plough, and de- 
ferred already in this work by a clergyman in Orkney ; 
but the principal tackfmen ufe the Scotch and Engli/h 
ploughs, of which there will be a dozen in the parifh. 
Horfe-loads are for the molt part carried in fmall creels, 
one on each fide of the horfe, and fixed by a rope to the 
crook-faddie ; but coup-carts, of which there are about 20 
in the parifh, are made ufe of by the gentlemen, and are 
drawn by larger horfes rhan thofe found in the parifh. 
There is a general mode of turning the ground, called 
timidh, or making lazy beds, at which two perfons are 
employed on each fide of the ridge; of thefe, two are cut- 
ting, and two lifting the clods, which, to a frranger, will ap-

pear abfurd, tedious, and laborious, but here is found to be 
neceflary, and productive of the greateft returns, in regard 
that it gathers the ground, and raifes it from the reach of 
the rifing and running water, with coks of which the fields 
abound, and which otherwife would link and deftroy the 
feed. The feed fown is black oats and barley* With the 
utmoft difficulty, about 40 years ago, the people were pre- 
vailed on to plant potatoes, but of which they now plant 
great quantities, by the plough and by the fpade, and find 
them to be the moft ufeful of all crops raifed in the parilh. 
They are fold at from 3 s. to 5 s. per barrel. In no feafon is 
the produce of this parifh fufficient to maintain its inhabi- 
tants, who would often be in danger of fuffering through 
want, were it not for the extenfive importation of meal to 
Stornoway. 

Jzr and Climate.— The air is extremely moift, and the 
climate very rainy. The dampnefs of the air is fo great, 
that polifhed iron, where conftant fire is not kept, will con- 
traft ruft in lefs time than 24 hours. The inhabitants of 
this ifland might live in comfortable ciroumftances, were it 
not for the frequent and heavy rains which fall in it all the 
feafons of the year, and more efpecially in harveft, where- 
by the hopes of the hufbaadmaa are often Mailed, and the 
fruit of his toil and induftry loft. Such a climate may na- 
turally be expeded in a fituation fo far to the north, and 
furrounded by an extenfive traft of deep wet mofs on the 
one fide, and the ocean on the other, though no high hills 
are here to break the clouds, as on the oppofite mainland. 
The oldeft* people affirm, that fince their youth, the cli- 
mate and feafons are greatly changed for worfe. Never- 
tnelefs, the inhabitants are healthy, and live to as great age 
as they do m a better climate, fome living to the age of 00 
or 100 years.

mer ; autumn is rainy •, the winter ufually not fo fevere as 
on the continent, but more open, and free of fnow and froft. 
Our Spring is often wet and cold. Sowing of oats com- 
mences here, in a dry fpring, with fome few individuals, in 
the beginning of March, but not in general till about the 
middle of April. Barley is fowri from the beginning of 
May to the end of June. Potatoes are planted from the 
middle of April to the 20th dwy of May. Harveft gene- 
rally begins about the middle of September, and the crop 
is not totally got into the barns and barn-yards before No- 
vember. 

Difeafes. — The only local and peculiar diftemper preva- 
lent in this parifh, is a ditorder which feizcs new-born in- 
fants about the fifth night after their birth, and carries 
them off by convulfive fits; but this fpecies of ficknefs is 
become lefs frequent than it has been heretofore. Rheu- 
matifm is often complained of. Inoculation is performed 
here with fuccefs by the Jkill and attention of Mi John Mil- 
lar, furgeon. 

Ecclejiajlical State of the Parifh. — The prefent incum- 
bent, Mr Colin Mackenzie, was admitted minifter of Stor- 
noway the a 7th day of Auguft 1789. His predeceflbrs 
Were, Mr Donald Monfon •, Mr John Clark, who was ad- 
mitted the 19th day of February 1747, and died 10th day 
i of Auguft 1772 ; Mr John Downie, now minifter ofUr- 
ray, who was admitted 22d day of July 1773, and tranf- 
lated to his prefent parifh the 25th day of September 1788, 
which laft Mr Mackenzie fucceeded in the charge. He 
h.as been married near two years, and has one fon. By the

lirig, with a manfe, and glebe of eight' acres, valued at L. 5. 
The firft manfe and glebe were at Stornoway ; the prefent 
glebe was defigned here at Tong, on the 5th day of Octo- 
ber 1758, and the manfe built thereon. The manfe was 
built 37 years ago, has often been repaired* and needs now 
to be rebuilt. The fituation is cold and wet. Tht church 
is new built, and elegantly finifhed. No parifh Hands in 
greater want of a miffionary than this, there being upwards 
of 1000 fouls who have not an opportunity of divine wor- 
Ihip, and the benefit of public infti udtion, except on every 
fifth Sabbath. In order to accommodate the other two di- 
Itrifts of the parifh with divine fervice alternately every 
fifth Sabbath, the church at Stornoway muft be vacant on 
that day, which is felt as no fmall grievance and dii id van- 
tage to the interelt of religion among fo numerous a con- 
gregation* 

The Poor. — Whilft Mrs Mackenzie of Seaforth refided ill 
this parilh, the moil indigent and infirm of the poor were 
fupported by a bounty of meal given by her, and diftri- 
buted weekly to them in proportion to their feveral necef- 
lities, in ljeu of which Seaforth gives them an annual dona- 
tion of ten guineas, to be laid out in meal for their ufe ) 
this, with the weekly collection, amounting yearly to about 
L. 20, mulcts, and the annual rent of a fund of L. 100 gra- 
dually made up, is all they have to depend upon from the 
kirk-feffion. Their number is 127, fixty-three of whom 
live about Stornoway. 

Price of Labour, and Wages of Servants — Here, indeed, 
by reafon of the multitudes levied for the army and navy, 
the great number of fub-tenants, and the many hands want- 
ed for the fifhing boats, labourers and farm-fervants are be- 
come very fcawe and difficult to be found. The wages of 

men- 



Statijiical Account 



roen-labodrers are 8d. a-day without meat, and 6' d. with 
two meals of meat and a dram. Women, 6d. a-day, or 
4 d. with two meals of meat. The day- wages of a carpen- 
ter and mafon, is. 6d. with viduals ; fmith, 2 s. j tailor, 

1 s. without, or 6 d. with meat j joiners, is. 6 d. per day j 
lhoemakers, io d. and i s. per day. Men-fervants for farm- 
work from L. 2, to L. 5 per annum, and 2 pair of flioes at 
7 s;; for women-fervants, from 10 s. to 20 s. and 2 pair of 
flioes at 6 s. Herds, for looking after cattle, from 6 merks 
to 8 s. and 2 pair of flioes, with other fmall perquilites. 
The wages of domeftic fervants are nearly the fame with 
thofe of farm-fervants. 

Roads, &amp;c. — Road-making was only begun in this ifland in 
1 791 ; and a road is made, four miles diftance from Stor- 
noway, acrofs a deep mofs of 10 computed miles, to the 
other fide of it. — Near to Stornoway there is an annual 
tryfl; for cattle, where fome hundreds are bought and ex- 
ported, at from L.I, 10 s. to L. 3 a-head. — Beef is fold m 
Stornoway from i£ d. to 3 d. per lib. ; mutton, 5 s. and 6s. 
per wedder ; flieep, 3 s. 4 s. and 4 s. 6 d. each; lambs, 
is. 8 d. and 2 s. each. Butter, 12 s. and 14 s. per ftone^

here are of a fmaller lize than in molt other places. In this 
ifland are found no foxes, badgers, nor hares, till of late 
years five hares were introduced by Seaforth, which are 
now increafed to almoft as many hundreds. Sea-fowls, and 
birds of the fame kind with thofe on the continent, are to 
be met with, except partridges, robin-red-breafts, rooks, 
and magpies.

Remarkable Injlance of Prefervation.-^gU years ago, a 
father and child, (a girl about eight years of age), going 
from Stornoway acrofs the moor, in company with feveral 
others, the father having forgot to execute fome part of his 
bufinefs in the town, haftily returned, and committed the 
care of his child to thofe in company with her, till he would 
overtake them ; the child inadvertently falling behind, was 
not miffed, till the travellers had proceeded far on their 
way, and the father had overtaken them ; who as foon as 
he found that his child was not in company, inftantly 
flew away like one dinged in queft of her, and with all 
the pangs of paternal forrow, returned again to Stornoway, 
late at night, weary and difappointed. Next day, many 
people went far and near in fearch of her, through deep 
fnow, and a tracklefs moor, repeating their diligence and 
minuted fcrutiny for feveral days fucceffively without ef- 
fect. When they had utterly defpaired to find her, (in- 
conceivable to believe it !) on the eighteenth day after fee 
was loft, the helplefs and unwary wanderer was,, by a man 
and dog, found near the fea-fide, alive and in motion, but 
fo faint and exhaufted by cold and hunger, that fee could 
not walk. She was carried to the town, humanely re- 
ceived, and all neceflary means ufed to reftore her almoft 
expiring life to health and ftrength. She was too young to 
give any diftinft account of the manner in which fee was 
enabled to fubfift fo long without food and feelter from the 
cold. She is now in the fervice of Mrs Mackenzie of Sea- 
forth, at Seaforth Lodge, who has been remarkably kind 
to her from the time of the above accident.

large openings or arches, by one of which they enter, and 
walk a long way under, where they meet with large tum- 
bling round nones, furrounded in part with water. As 
they advance further in, they come to a fine pleafant beach, 
where they meet with the feals ; further in Mill, there is a 
fmall chamber, which by the light of the torches appears re- 
markably white, its roof being all covered with white fta- 
Jaaitae, which are hanging from the roof, like to large ici- 
cles ; fome of them put on the figure of hieroglyphics, and 
each of them feems perforated from the bafe to the point

SUPPLEMENT, 

By another Hand. 

Stronoway has its modern name from the fituation of 
the village, which is built on a point jutting into the har- 
bour, and in the language of the country called Stron a 
Bhaigh, or, the Nofe of the Bay, from which, by an eafy 
tranfition, comes Stornoway. Ui was the ancient name of 
the parifh. There is in it a place called Ui, which was of 
old the only place of worfhip in the parifh, and is lituated 
on a narrow neclc of land ; every fuch neck of land, or ifth- 
mus, whether formed by creeks of the fea, or by the appro- 
ximation of frelh-water lakes, is in Lewis called Ui, which, 
in the Danifh language fignifies any fuch neck of land ; 
and the particular Ui already mentioned having been in 
former time the only place devoted to divine worfhip, gave 
its ancient name to the parifh. 

The extent of it is ten computed miles in length, and its 
breadth in fome places feven. It is bounded by the parifh 
of Barvas on the north ; on the north-eaft by the channel 
between Lewis and the main of Scotland; and on the fouth . 
and weft by the parifh of Lochs. The general'appearance 
of it is a flat , moor, of little utility to beafts, and of none to 
man, all covered with heath. The ifland is compared to a 
gold-laced hat ; the internal part of which confifts of this 
foft and ufelefs moor, and the circumference of which is in 
part more or lefs cultivated at the fea-lide. Near the town 
of Stornoway the foil is a light black mould, forced into 
fome culture from mofs ; to the northward, the foil is co- 
vered by drifted fand ; but farther back, of fimilar quality 
to that near the town. Neither of thefe foils, when pro- 
perly drained and manured, can be called unfertile.

The an- ia moift, but agrees well with the natives. The 
prevwhng diftempers are the fame with thofe ftated in the 
account of the pariln of Uig. The moor in this pariftl 
abounds ,n lakes. There are fix fmall rivulets. The frenZ 
water lakes contain great quantities of fmall trout. Three 
of the rivulets produce fome falmon and fea-trour. The 
lalmon is fold frefh at x d. per Englifh pound in Stornoway. 
JTheir fiih IS very poor; they are beft m July and AugufL 
The length of the fea-coaft is 25 computed miles ; the more 
in fome places is rocky, and in fome flat and fandy. 

There is a great quantity of ling on the coaft, and a few 
cods, both of which are well cured and dried by the coun- 
try people ; they fell them at above L. 14 Sterling^ ton 
to the Stornoway merchants, who fend them to foreign 
markets. They are all caught with long lines 5 the hooks 
are baited with pieces of fmaller fifhes. The utmoft quan- 
tity fiflied, one year with another, does not exceed from 20 
to 30 tons. They are moft in feafon in fpring. Herrings 
are caught in Loch Stornoway, fome years in great abun- 
dance, and fome not. The cod and ling are always ftation- 
ary here. There are 30 decked veffels belonging to this 
port, from 20 to So tons burden each, which are employed 
in the fummer feafon in the herring bounty -fifhing, and at 
other times in the coafting trade. They are manned with 
natives of the ifland, and are always viftualled, except as. 
to the article of beef only, in the country.— Common fea- 
weed is always ufed for manure. A few tons of kelp are 
manufactured every third year in the parifh.— The prin- 
cipal Bays are, — Broad Bay, South Bay, Loch Storno- 
way, and Loch Grim/hader ; the laft is a fafe harbour 
for fmall veffels ; the firft but an indifferent one. In 
South Bay veffels fometimes flop for a tide, but it is no 
harbour. Loch Stornoway is a famous harbour for mips 
of any burden j the ground is good, and no weighty fea can

ever come in to it. The four principal headlands are 
Tolfta-head, Seller-head, Tiumpan-nead, and Pebble-head. 

In this parifli there is a remarkable cave, into which the 
fea goes at high water. When it was firft noticed, vaft 
numbers of feals were killed in if, and the prance is ftill 
continued once a-year, about Michaelmas. It is only ac- 
ceffible from fea ; the people land ' from their boat oppofite 
to the cave in time of low water, at fpring-tide ; they walk 
forward, and being furnilhed with fire, they light torches 
at the entry to the cave, which is dark far in, and they 
knock to death all the feals found there with heavy blud- 
geons armed with iron. At firft it was not uncommon to 
fee 50 killed at a time ; but now the number does not ex- 
ceed from 7 to 12. At the fartheft end, there is a fmall 
apartment, the top of which is lined with ftalaftitae, or icicles, 
of a very -firm confiftence ; it is about an eighth part of an 
Englifh mile in length, and its height is variable. — The 
otter, and tighan or foumart, are found in this parifh. Moor- 
fowl, plover, and wild pidgeon, are in great abundance. 

In the country part of the parifh are fpun and woven all 
the cloth neceffary for labourers, and make all the broags 
ufed there. Mrs Mackenzie of Seaforth gives encourage- 
ment in this as well as in the other parifhes of Lewis, to 
induftrious females, in the fpinning of flax, &amp;c. and be- 
ftows L. 10 yearly on the poor. — In this parifti there is one 
attorney, and one folitary Roman Catholic prieft, without 
an individual of a flock. In the town there are many bat- 
chelors among the fuperior rank. The number of inhabit- 
ed flated houfes in this town is 67. They are all made of 
the beft materials ; fome of them large, commodious and 
Well furniihed ; they are generally two ftories high and 
a garret ; there is a cuftomhoufe, with all its proper 
officers, a town-houfe, an afiembly-room, and two fchool- 
houfes; one for the parochial grammar-fchool, and the 
V.OL. XIX. K k other

other for the Society fchool eftabliflied there.-On the 
north-weft fide of the town there are upwards of twenty 
thatched houfes, which have ftrong walls and gables, with 
,glaf S -windows, all in a line, fronting the fide of the bay 
where xt grows narrow. On the north fide of the tow. 
there IS a great number of referable thatched huts, occu- 
pied by faxlors, filhers, and other people, with their fami- 
lies. The poor inhabitants of thofe huts have built more 
commod.ous thatched houfes along the fhore of the bay, eaft 
of the town j and Mr Mackenzie of Seaforth gives every 
head of a family one guinea to encourage them to remove, 
and to help them in defraying the expences incurred on the 
occafion. He gives thofe poor people 20 years leafe of 
their dwelling-places, to each of which a fmaJl garden is 
joined, and they pay three Scotch merks yearly for every 
fuch houfe-room and garden. He gives them full liberty 
to cultivate as much as they can of a neighbouring moor, 
and exads no rent for feven years for fuch parts thereof as 
they bring into culture.— In this, and all the other parifhes 
of the ifland, the women carry on as much at leaft of the 
labours of agriculture as the men ; they carry the manure 
in bafkets on their backs ; they pulverize the ground after 
it is fown, with heavy hand-rakes, (harrows being feldom 
ufed), and labour hard at digging the ground, both with 
crooked and ftraight fpades — The people of the town fel- 
dom have menfervants engaged for the year ; and it is* 
curious circumftance, that, time out of remembrance, their 
maidfervants were in the habit of drinking, every morn- 
ing, a wine glafs full of whiiky, which their miftrefs gave 
them ; this barbarous cuftom became fo well eftabliflied by 
length of time, that if the pradice of it fhould happen to 
be negkcled or forgotten in a family, even once, difcontent 
and idleriefs t' roughout the day, on the part of the maid or 
maids, would be the fure confequence. However, fince thq

itoppage of the diftilleries took place, the people of the 
town found it neceflary to unite in the refolution of abo- 
lifting the practice, by withholding the dear cordial from 
their female domeftics, but not without the precaution of 
making a compenfation to them in money for their griev- 
ous lofs; and it is faid, that even this is not fatisfa&amp;ory, 
and that, in fome families, the dram is ftill given privately, 
to preferve peace and good order. 

About 200 yards from the town, on the oppofite, or 
fouth-weft fide of the bay, and upon an eminence, ftands 
Seaforth Lodge, a neat modern houfe. 

The only crops in this parifh are fmall oats, barley, and 
potatoes. The parifh never fupplies itfelf with fufficieucy 
of provifion, but always imports a great deal from Caith- 
nefs, Berwick, &amp;c and is at this time (1796) in great diftrels, 
without a probability of a fpeedy fupply. — Black cattle 
are bought by dealers from the fouth yearly in this and 
the other parifhes of the ifland, and driven to England, 
where they thrive amazingly, although the breed is but; 
fmall. — A little flax and hemp is raifed here.— They fow 
in April and May, and reap in September and October.— 
There is no wood of any kind. The whole ifland feems, 
in ancient time, to have been covered with wood, as is 
proved by flumps of large trees and hazle-nut fhells being 
found at the fides of rivulets., and in the moor, at the depth of 
14 feet, where the people dig peats. According to tradition, 
the Norwegians fet the whole woods on fire when they 
took poffefijon of the country. — The great difadvantage of 
this and the neighbouring parifhes arifes from the poverty 
of the foil, and the badnefs of the climate, the latter of 
which this ifland experiences in common with all the other 
iflands and Highlands of Scotland, — If the circumflances of 
the people in the country part of this parifh could admit 
of it, they might derive great advantages from the goo^i

nefs of the harbour at Stornoway, as well as from the vici- 
nity of the village. — The Gaelic language is principally 
fpoken, and the names of places are evidently derived from, 
the Danifli and Norwegian. —The value of the living, the 
glebe not included, isL. 86. It is in the gift of the Crown. 
Mr Colin Mackenzie is minifter •, he is a married man, and 
has one fon. — A very elegant church was lately built at 
Stornoway ; the internal ceconomy of it is very nearly ff« 
niflied ; the expence of the whole work is faid to amount 
to L. 900. This fabric does great honour to- the proprietor. 
The manfe is old, but commodious. — Francis Humberfton 
Mackenzie of Seaforth is fole heritor of the landed proper- 
ty in this parifli. — The poor are fupported by the inhabi- 
tants when they come to their houfes in courfe ; the kirk- 
feflion diftributes among them fuch fums of money as arife 
from the collections on Sabbath-days, and fines from irre- 
gular perfons. — The country people commonly fell cattle 
alive to the inhabitants of Stornoway at different prices, 
conformed to their fize and quality, and to the demand for 
fuch in other parts of the kingdom. When they fell them 
by weight, they draw from 2 d. to 3 d. per lib. Small wed- 
ders are fold at 5 s. and 6 s. each; and the common fowls 
a t 6 J. — When the feafon for cutting peats comes on, the 
fervice of the country people cannot be difpenfed with by 
thofe in the town. The former, both males and females, 
come forward in great numbers, and receive from 4 d. to 
6 d. per day, and they muft be feafted on the occafion, 
otherwife the work mall be found very defective. When 
the peats are dry, the people are again called upon to lead 
them home, which work is conducted with equal expence. 
The wages paid to labourers in huibandry is much about 
the fame here as in the neighbouring parifhes. — Few 
ploughs are ufed here. They have, in this country, the 
moft awkward inftrument of tillage ever applied to the

femblance to a plough, having only one Mf the ufe of it 
is productive of great fatigue to men and horfes 5 and after 
all, the ground is wretchedly ill turned. 

On a fmall point near the town, there is a veftige re- 
maining of a caftle built for the proteftion of the place, by 
the Macleods, the ancient poffeffors of the ifland-. Not 
far from it there was another tower, built by Cromwell to 
awe the neighbourhood ; no part of this one remains. 
The people are not fond of a military life ; but early habit 
reconciles them to fea-faring, and from that element they 
derive their chief fubfiftence. 

There is a road begun and carried on for a few miles 
from Stornoway towards the parifh of Barvas, which lies 
in a northern direaion. The moor acrofs the ifland from 
Stornoway to Uig is fo extenfive and foft, that it would re- 
quire the labour of many ages to open a road through it. 

Some years ago, a young girl, in attempting to go from 
©ne part of the country to another, loft her way in the 
pathlefs moor, and could not find it ; when her ftrength 
failed, me dropped down, and notwithftanding the induftry 
of the country people in queft of her, me was not found 
until the eighteenth day after her departure from home. 
To the aftonifliment of all who heard her ftory, life was 
found remaining ; and by the afliduity of the furgeon, me 
was reftored to good health and ftrength. This wonder- 
ful cafe is recorded in the 12th or 14th volume of the 
Medical Efiays. 

The common people of this ifland marry very early, 
and when death feparates them, if the furviving party, 
Whether male or female, finds it convenient to engage a

By the Rev. Mr Donald Macdonald, Minifies</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

THE parifli of Barvas does not furnifh much room for 
ftatiftical inveftigation, and the few obfervations 
which occur refpe&amp;ing it, may be comprehended within 
narrow bounds. As to the origin of its name, little but 
conjecture can be advanced ; it is generally thought to be 
Danifh or Norwegian, as the names of feveral other places 
on this coaft indubitably are. It is fituated in the weftern 
extremity ot the county of Rofs, fynod of Glenelg, and 
prefbytery ot Lewis. It is very extenfive, being in length 
from eaft to weft 24 computed miles, and, upon an average, 
9 miles in breadth j bounded on the weft by a diftricl: of the 

parifli

Statiflical Account 



parifh of Lochs; on the north, by the Atlantic Ocean- en 
the eaft by the Minch ; and on the fouth, by the parifhes 
of Stofnoway and Lochs. 

Surface and Soil.— The furface of the whole parifh is 
pretty plain, except a few hills, at a confiderable diftance 
from the fea, and fome fmall glens or vallies through which 
rivulets run. The foil, as may naturally be fuppofed in 
fuch a vaft track of ground, is various. The diftridt called 
Claddoch is light, thin, fpouty ground, and in many places 
fo full of ftones, that the plough cannot go through it. 
Nefsconfiftsof fine large level fields, compofed of loam*, 
fand, gravel, and deep clay, iwhich, in good feafons, pro- 
duce tolerable crops, and in the hands of more Ikilful and 
fubftantial tenants might be turned to a very good account. 
The fea-coaft, taking in the various points that jut out into 
the fea, may be reckoned about 30 computed miles ; it is 
bold and rugged, having a tremendous furf or fwell upon 
it, when the wind blows from the weft and north-weft. 
There is not a fingle harbour where a veflel can anchor, 
and but a few creeks where boats can land, even in the 
fineft weather. 

Climate and Difeafes. — It is well known, that a great deal 
of rain falls in moft parts of the weft and north-weft of 
Scotland ; there is, however, lefs here than upon the main- 
land coaft, or even in the adjacent parifhes, the high hills 
which collecl the vapours, and break the clouds, being at a 
confiderable diftance. The froft is feldom very intenfe ; 
the fnow, in general, not deep, or of long continuance. The 
air, though moift, is falubrious. Rheumatifm, the general 
complaint of all moift climates, is very common ; it is ra- 
ther matter of furprife that it is not more frequent, confi- 
dering their damp and dirty houfes, how much the inha- 
bitants

bitants are expofed HI rain and cold, and their clothing 
poor. Flannel-fhirts, which are in general worn by the 
common people, may be a good antidote agamft it. Fevers 
and fluxes are not uncommon ; and many infants die ot a 
complaint called the five nights ficknefs, from their dying 
of it upon the fifth or fixth night; there are no mftances 
of any who have been feized with it that efcaped, nor has 
the nature of this uncommon difeafe been as yet fully com- 
prehended by the moft fkilful upon this ifland. 

Rivers, Woods, Wc— There is not a fingle tree, or even 
any brum wood, to be feen in the whole parifti. There are 
feveral fmall lakes or lochs, and fome rivulets, but no ftream 
that deferves the name of a river. In thefe are various 
kinds of trout, and in a few of them fome falmon. Upon 
the minifter's farm is a fmall water, where a few fine fal- 
mon, though of a fmall fize, are caught, from the month of 
May till Auguft. There are a few cod, ling, and haddock, 
taken upon the coaft ; but the principal filhing is that of 
dog-fifh, from the liver of which they extrad a confider- 
able quantity of oil. Upon an average, there are about 8832 
Scotch pints annually manufactured of it, and fold to the 
Stornoway merchants at from 6 d. to 8 d. per pint. Five 
of the annual bounties or premiums given by the Truftees 
for encouraging this trade, are generally gained by boats in 
this parifti. The feafon for it is from the beginning of 
May to the latter end of Auguft, when the weather proves 
favourable ; indeed, it mult be very moderate before they 
can venture to fea, which makes them exceedingly cau- 
tious when the wind blows off the land, left they be driven 
to the northern ocean. It is very aftonifliing how few ac- 
cidents happen, confidering the terrible feas they encoun- 
ter, and the badnefs of the creeks where they land. The 
number of boats employed in this fifliiug is about 42, from

1 6 to 19 feet keel, fome of 8, and others of 6 oars. Their 
only implement is a hand-line, with two large hooks. 

Agriculture, Cattle, &amp;c. -There are in the parifh about 
90 ploughs, and all, except one (ufed by the minifter,) of a 
lingular conftruclion ; they are made of a crooked fmall 
piece of wood, on the top of which is fixed a ftilt or handle ; 
the man who holds it walks by its fide, and direcls it by 
this ftilt. As no. oxen are ufed here, it is drawn by four 
fmall horfes ; the driver, if he can be fo called, goes before 
the horfes, and pulls them on by the halter. In fome pla- 
ces the ground is turned up by two inftruments well known 
in the Highlands, called crooked and even fpades •, in molt 
of thefe parts, the ground is fo rugged, and full of ftones, 
that the plough cannot go through it. There are no carts 
ufed in the parifh, except by the minifter. The manures 
are cow-dung, and tangle or fea-ware ; there i3 another 
kind univerfally ufed here, perhaps not known elfewhere; 
their houfes are thatched with ftubble and heather ropes, 
(ropes made of heath), their roofs are fo low and flat, and 
they burn fuch quantities of peat, their only fuel, that the 
ftubble is abundantly covered over with foot ; in the lat- 
ter end of May, when the barley brard (blade) appears, 
they take this footy ftubble, and ftrew it thinly upon it, 
which fometimes produces a tolerable crop, but muft 
fcourge the ground. The only crops reared here are black 
oats, bear, and potatoes, fown in April and May, and reaped 
in September and October. The returns are in general 
poor/owing to the poverty of the foil, and the cold and 
boifterous gales from the northern ocean, to which the lands 
are much expofed. The parifti abounds in horfes, black- 
cattle, and iheep, perhaps too many for the pafture. There 
is no faying, with minute exactnefs, what the number of 
each may be. Horfes, according to a furvey lately made, 
were calculated at 1050; black-cattle, 2670; fheep, 339a; 

Ihe

The horfcs and cows are of a very fmall fize, partly owing 
to the pafture, but more fo to the little attention paid to 
the proper feleftion of bulls and ftallions, by which they 
are yearly decreafing, and muft continue fo to do till this 

evil be remedied. \ 

AH the flieep, except a few of the black-faced kind in- 
troduced by the minifter, are remarkably fmall. They 
roam at large through the moor, without any herdfman to 
attend them. Though very wild, they are in general, how- 
ever, fo far tame, that they can be driven into fmall inclo- 
fures, where the wool is pulled off, a barbarous cullom, 
which certainly muft be detrimental to the animal and its 
wool, and indeed proves fatal, when the weather happens 
to be fevere immediately after this plucking.— The horfes, 
though fmall, are remarkably hardy and mettled.— The beef 
and mutton fweet and well flavoured.— Horfes, upon an 
average, fell at L. 2, 10 s. ; cows and ftots at L. 2,5 s.; and 
flieep at 3 s. each. 

Population. — It is impoflible to fay what number of fouls 
might have been in the parifli, as.there never were any regi- 
fters kept. Population, however, is allowed to be on the 111- 
creafe, chiefly owing to the farms being much fmaller than 
in former times. There are in the parifli, 439 families, 
2006 fouls, 914 males, 1092 females : Souls under 6 years 
old, 334 ; ditto betwixt 6 and 14 years, 407 ; ditto betwixt 
14 and 60 years, 1067 ; and above 60, 198. In 1755, the 
population, by Dr Webfter's lift, was 1995. There are 14 
weavers, 5 tailors, 7 blackfmiths, 340 fiflaers, and 1 miller. 
There is not one man by profeffion a flioemaker ; the mod 
of the inhabitants fupply themfelves with flioes or brogues; 
nor, indeed, do any of the above tradefmen depend wholly 
upon their occupations, all of them having fmall farms.

Church, Schools, and Stipends.— The Crown is Patron ; 
Colonel Francis Humberflone Mackenzie of Seaforth folc 
heritor. AH the inhabitants are, of the Eftablifhed Church 
of Scotland. There are two places of worlhip in the pa- 
rifli. The church clofe by the manfe is a perfed ruin, and 
is to be rebuilt firft fummer. The one in the diftricl of 
Nefs, about 12 computed miles from the manfe, an old 
Popifli church, called St Peter's, was enlarged and rebuilt 
laft year ; it is thatched with heath. The rent of the pa- 
rifh is about L. 900 Sterling, befides kelp, which was never 
attempted here till within a few years back. It is thought 
the mores will produce 60 tons once in three years.— The 
fhpend, till this year, was only 1000 merks Scots, and 
L. 5 Sterling for a glebe, to which Colonel Mackenzie 
added L. 20 Sterling. The prefent incumbent, Mr Do- 
nald Macdonald, was fettled in 1790. His predecefTors 
were, Meffrs Alexander Mackay, and Murdoch and Do- 
nald Morrifons. The manfe is fmall ; was built about 28 
years ago, and repaired laft year at a confiderable expence ; 
the kitchen, which is the only office-houfe, was repaired 
and flated at the fame time. 

There has not been a parochial fchool here for many 
years back ; but Colonel Mackenzie, who is very defirous 
to have fchools erected, contrafted with an undertaker two 
years ago, to build a fchool-houfe near the manfe, but ow- 
ing to various circumftances, it has not as yet been accom- 
plithed. There has been a cliarity-fchool eftablifhed in 
the diftricl of Nefs by the Honourable Society for many 
years back ; it is to be lamented, that the people in gene- 
ral have as yet fo little tafte for education. There are only 
about 20 fcholars who attend j though, from the compact-

from their parents houfes. The fchoolmafter, however, 
is of great fervice in fuch a remote corner, by his diligence 
in catechifing and reading to the people on every Lord s 
day, when the minifter is not there. * 
Mrs Mackenzie of Seaforth, whofe zeal for the good of 
her people is confpicuous upon all occafions, has eretfed 
two fpinning-fchools, with a falary of L.6 Sterling to each 
of the miftrefies. To aid her in this laudable undertaking, 
the Honourable Society refolved to pay one-half of faid 
falary. The girls are taught gratis, have 10 d. for every 
fpindle they fpin, and to encourage them, they have their 
wheels at a low rate •, many of the pooreft have them gra- 
tis. She allows 1 lb. of coarie lint for themfelves to begin 
with ; befides, as a fpur to induftry and emulation, annual 
competitions are held, when premiums are given to the 
beft fpinners. 

Poor.— There are 80 upon the poor-roll, who are chief- 
ly fupported by the charity of the inhabitants, by begging 
from houfe to houfe •, any fupport they get from the kirk- 
feflion is by no means adequate to their maintenance. 
There is about L. 4 annually distributed amongft them, 
(arifing from the weekly collections and m tufts), together 
with five guineas of a yearly donation from Mrs Macken- 
zie of Seaforth, whofe benevolence and charity have been 
of univerfal good throughout this whole ifland. She has, 
befides, upon her lift, two very great b;e£ts in this parifti, 
to each of whom Ihe allows three bolls of meal annually. 
There is another mode here for fupporting the poor, which 
fhews the charitable difpofition of the inhabitants ; being in 
general fcarce of money for the weekly collections, they, 
every fpring, collect a certain quantity of grain or feed,

which is regularly divided by the kirk-feffion amongft the

Antiquities.— Several ruins of Popifh chapels or churches 
are to be feen in the parifh ; round moft of them are burying- 
grounds, which are to this day ufed for that purpofe. A few 
or them can only be traced by the foundation-ftones ; the 
walls of others are pretty entire. The largeft and moft 
entire is that at Eorapie in Nefs, dedicated to St Mulvay ; 
it feems to have been the principal one, and undoubtedly 
ufed as a place of worfhip. It is 50 feet long, 24 broad, 
and 16 feet in the fide walls ; the people around it, pay it 
as yet a great deal of fuperfiitious veneration, and indeed 
fome of them retain ftill a few of the Popilh fuperftitions, 
A little to the north of it flood St Ronan's, and clofe by it, 
to the fouth, flood a houfe, built by one of the Macleods, 
once the proprietors of this ifland ; there is ftill a piece of 
wall (landing, called by them Macleod's Gate. The flones 
are moflly carried away by the tenants for building their 
houfes. Some hundred yards to the fouth of that is a fmall 
mount, which evidently bears the mark of having" once a 
building upon it, called Caiftel Olgre, ( i. e.) Olaus his 
Caftle. The names of the reft, which are but fmall in 
comparifon to St Mulvay's, are, St Peter's in Haboft, St 
Thomas's in Swainboft, St Clement's in North Dell, Holy 
Crofs at South Galfon, St Bridget in Borve, St Peter's in 
Lower Strather, St Mary's in Upper Barvas, and St John 
the Baptifl's in Bragir. Betwixt Borve and Galfon, upon 
an eminence at a fmall diflance from the fea, may be feen 
the ruins of a pretty large dun, or Danifh fort, of a circular 
form, with pafiages and fmall apartments in the walls ; the 
only entry was from the top. Tradition fays, that there 
■was a fubterraneous communication to it from the fea, of 
which no veftige can now be traced. There is another of

lis behind Strather and Borve, at a confiderable diftance 
from the fea, each of them having a caufe way lead, ng to 
hem which are vifible in dry weather. Betwixt Barvas 
and Strather, in the middle of a deep mofs, where no other 
Tones are to be feen, and at a confiderable diftance from 
the fea, there is a very large none fending upright, called 
Clach i Drujhel, famous for nothing but its fize being 18 
feet above ground, and 14 feet in circumference, having no 
figures upon it, as erroneoufly related. The vulgar trac- 
tion concerning it, is tooabfurd and fuperrtitious to deferve 
any notice. The ifland of Rona, fituate in the northern 
ocean, about 16 leagues diftant from Eorapie Point, or the 
butt of the Lewis, (which is reckoned the furtheft to the 
north-weft of any in Europe), belongs to this panto. It IS 
reckoned a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth % 
there is a temple in it dedicated to St Ronan. It is rented 
by one of the Nefs tackfmen at L. 4 Sterling per annum, 
who regularly, every feafon, fends a large open boat, and 
brings from it fome corn, butter, cheefe, a few flxeep, and 
fometimes a cow, befides fome wild-fowl and feathers. 
There were once five families refiding upon it, but now 
only one, who are employed by the tackfman as fervants. 

The rock Sulifker lies 4 leagues to the eaft of Rona; it 
is a quarter of a mile in circumference, and abounds with a 
great variety of fea-fowl. The boat which goes to Rona, 
generally touches there for fowls and feathers. There is 
in Nefs a moft venturous fet of people, who for a few years 
back, at the hazard of their lives, went there in an open 
fix. oared boat, without even the aid of a compafs. There 
is no place in it where they can draw up their boat ; fome 
of them continue in it, taking fhelter under the lee-fide of 
the rock, whilft the reft are bufy in taking the birds, who

Miffaneom 06/er^ions^There are neither moles 
frogs, foxes, or weafels, in the parilh, nor any hares, till of 
late a few made their appearance from a breed introduced 
into the ,aand by Seaforth. It abounds with pidgeon, plo- 
ver, fnipe, and a vaft variety of wild-geefe and ducks. The 
fwan, woodcock and green plover, appear in their feafon. 
ihe coaft abounds with a variety of fea-fowls. Eagles, 
corbies and crows, are numerous, and often prove deftruc- 
tive to the young lambs. The greateft difadvantage this 
panfti lies under, is, the want of roads and bridges. From 
this fide of the ifland to the village of Stornoway is rec- 
koned from 12 to 18 miles of a broken fwampy moor, 
without fo much as the form of a road acrofs this long and 
fatiguing fpace ; the poor people are under the neceffity of 
carrying every article almoft, to and from Stornoway, upon 
their backs. Colonel Mackenzie, who is very eager to re- 
medy this evil, has, for a few years back, begun a road to 
open a communication betwixt both fides of the ifland, and 
carried it forward about five miles at a great expence. , In 
place of the ftatute labour, every man, from 16 to 60 years 
of age, pays is. 6 d. There is only one annual fair for 
felling cattle held in this whole ifland, confequently the 
fellers are under the neceffity of difpofing of them at that 
time, having no chance of feeing any other buyer during 
that feafon, except for fuch fat cattle as are purchafed by 
the Stornoway merchants. Until there be a comfortable 
communication opened betwixt both fides of the ifland ; 
until the breed of cattle of every kind be improved, and 
fome mode contrived for a better market for them ; this 
parifli muft labour under great difadvantages. On the 
other hand, it is no fmall advantage, in. fuch a high and cold

latitude, to have fuch abundance of very fine peats clofe by 
their houfes in general. The fifh of different kinds are molt 
beneficial, efpecially that of the dog-filh, the oil of which 
brings a confiderable fum of money, and the nib, when 
properly cured, has, by long experience, been found to be 

wholefome food. 

The fnow feldom lies deep or long ; a circumftance 
highly favourable to Iheep and black-cattle. As the lands 
were never meafured, it is impoffible to fay with any cer- 
tainty what the number of acres may be, but the extent, of 
the cultivated land bears no proportion to the uncultivated. 
The common language of the paviih is Gaelic. The names 
of places are derived from the Norwegian language, and by 
thofe who underfland it, are allowed to be very expreffive 
of their lituation.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">LOCHS</name>, 

(County of R 0Ss , Synod of Glenelg, Island and 
Presbytery of Lewis). 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Simson.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, l$c. 

r "T"*HIS parifh derives its name from the numerous har- 
hours which are in it, and which are always in this 
country called Lochs. They are fo well fecured from the 
lea, that many of them are very well adapted for places of 
anchorage to vefiels of confiderable burden, and the whole 
of them for fmall veflels, and are excellent landing-places 
for open boats. The parifti may alio derive its name in 
part from the innumerable bodies (lochs) of frefn water, 
fituated in the moor, all of which abound with fmall 
trout of excellent quality. It is fituated in the county of 
Rofs, within the bounds of the prefoytery of Lewis, and 
2 fynod 



of Lochs. 



fynod of Glenelg- The extent of the parifh in length is 
about 18 computed miles, not including the. feveral femes 
acrofs the forefaid harbours which intervene in that ftraight 
line. The extent of the fea-coaft, following the more in all 
its direftions, is 90 computed miles. In a country fo much 
interfered by numerous arms of the fea, the breadth muft 
be various, but at an average it holds at about 8 or 9 miles. 
It is bounded on the fouth by Loch Seaforth, which fepa- 
rates it from the parifh of Harris ; on the weft, by the pa- 
rifh of Uig ; on the north, by the parifh of Stornoway ; and 
on the eaft, by the channel, which feparates this ifland from 
the continent of Rofs. Along the coaft. it has a bold and 
rocky appearance •, farther back, there is a great extent of 
foft flat moor. There is no foil but what the indefatigable 
induftry of the inhabitants has forced into fome cultivation, 
near the creeks of the fea, with the aid of fea-weed for ma- 
nure. The air is very moift, but not unhealthy. 

Dijiempers. — The rofe or eryfipelas, colds, and rheuma- 
tifms, are the moft common diftempers prevalent in this 
country ; fometimes very infectious and epidemical fevers 
rage here, which terminate the lives of a great many of the 
inhabitants. 

Fijberies.— Cod and ling conftitute the principal {idling 
on the coaft, of which kinds of fifh there are caught annually 
at an average, 24 tons. The ling, when cured, fells at 
L. 15, io s. per ton, and the cod at L. 10 ; it is fold to the 
merchants of Stornoway, who export it to the beft market 
they can find ; both the cod and lirig are in the greateft 
perfection from February to May. All the other kinds of 
fifties, which are commonly met with on the coaft of the 
ifles, and which are fit for immediate family ufe, are caught

here m great abundance. Between 45 and 50 tons of kelp 
are manufactured annually. The flood-tide invariably runs 
from fouth to north, both on the more and at fea, and of 
courfe, the ebb-tide in the contrary direftion. Loch Sea- 
forth, Lochihell,and Locherifort, arc the principal harbours. 
Acrofs the entry of each of the two latter, there is an ifland, 
which makes them fecure retreats for veffels in all kinds of 
weather. In the channel between Lewis and Sky, a third 
of the way nearer the former than the latter, are three 
iflands, named Shaint or Holy Iflands, well known to ma- 
riners i one of them, in particular, feems to have been de- 
dicated to the Virgin Mary ; it is named Moair, or Mary's 
Ifl and ; in it there are the remains of a Popifli chapel. 
Black-cattle are paftured on them all, and they are famous 
for fattening fheep, but particularly fome fmall rocks in 
their neighbourhood, which have grafs on their tops. There 
is one family refiding on the largeft of the iflands, for the 
purpofe of attending the cattle. The head of this family 
has been fo unfortunate as to lofe, at different times, his 
wife, a fon, and a daughter, by falling down great preci- 
pices ; the mother and fon met with this cataftrophe in fol- 
lowing fheep, and the daughter, by going in queft of wild- 
fowl eggs. — Keback-heacl, and the point of Rairnifli, are 
the two principal headlands on thecoaft. Moflof the parifh 
is covered with heath. 

Population. — The whole amount of the population in 
this parifh is 1768 perfons, of which number, 845 are males, 
and 923 arc females. Population in 1755, by Dr Web- 
fter's jifr, appears to have been 1267. Inflances of longe- 
vity occur often ; a woman died a few days ago aged 104. 
The number of families is 566. Moft of the inhabitants 
are fifhers and netmakers. There are 38 kelp-makers, 
iC weavers of coarfe cloth, 2 boat-carpenters, 3 tailors, and 



of Lochs. W1 

, blackfmiths, in the parifh. Every individual here is of 
the Eftablifhed Church. 

Hu/bandry. -The number of black-cattle, not including 
the calves, is 2488 J the number of fheep, 4000 , the num- 
ber of horfes, 348. The different kinds ot cattle are of a 
fmall breed, which adapts them well to the rouga ground 
on which they pafture. There is very little corn railed ui 
this parifh. Their fmall crops are fown in the months of 
April and May, and reaped in September and Goober. 
The inhabitants rely principally on fifh for their iublift- 



ence. 



Languag e .— The Gaelic language is their mother tongue ; 
many of the names of places are derived from the Daniftt 
and Norwegian languages. , 

R ent —The land-rent of the parifh is L. 1020, 5 s. 

Ecclefiajlical State of the Parifh.— The value of the mi- 
nifter's living, including the glebe, is L. 80. The King is 
patron. Alexander Simfon is now minifter of the parifh, 
and was fettled there three years ago. His immediate pre- 
deceffor was John Frazer ; before whom were James Wil- 
fon, Alexander Mackay, and Colin Mackenzie, who was 
the firft minifter of the parifh. The prefent incumbent is 
married, and has 3 boys and a givl. A new manfe, two 
churches, and a parochial fchoolhoufe were built laft year, 
and offices for the manfe are to be built this year ; there 
was a Society fchoolhoufe built three years ago. Colonel 
Francis Humberfton Mackenzie of Seaforth is fole heritor 
of the parifh.

There is no doubt that the condition of the inhabitants of 
this poor parilh might be greatly meliorated by the intro, 
duflion of manufadures. In this particular, Mrs Colonel 
Mackenzie of Seaforth has already made fome confiderable 
advances, by directing theMnduftry of the female inhabitants 
to the ufeful and rational occupation of fpinning flax. Se- 
veral merchants at Aberdeen fend a great quantity of flax 
annually to a truttee at Stornoway, who diftributes it to be 
fpun, not only in this, but in all the parilhes of Lewis. In 
this parilh there are -two fpinning fchools, the miftrefles of 
each of them are paid jointly by Mrs Mackenzie of Sea- 
forth, and the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge. 
The forementioned truftee has a yearly falary paid him by 
Mrs Mackenzie and the faid Society. To encourage the 
young women to 'acquire the perfeft knowledge of fpinning 
there is an annual competition at each of the fchools, and 
premiums given by Mrs Mackenzie to the beft performers, 
for the purpofe of exciting a laudable emulation. The 
premiums are held out to all the taught fpinflers in the

<p>Name and Situation. 

UIG, in the common acceptation of the word, fignifies, 
in many parts of the Highlands, a folitary place, much 
fequeftered from the public eye ; which feems to apply with 
particular propriety to the local fituation of this parifli, it 
being feparated from the parifli of Stornoway and Lochs, 
which lie on the eaft and fouth-eaft coaft of the ifland, by an 
extenfive flat and foft moor, no lefs than 12 computed miles 
in length ; on the fouth weft it is bounded by the moun- 
tains of Harris ; on the weft, by the Atlantic Ocean ; and 
on the north, by a part of the parifli of Lochs, which in 
that place runs acrofs the country from eaft to weft. It is 
fltuated in the county of Rofs, ifland and prclbytery of 

Lewis, 



tffUig. 



and fynod of Gfenelg. The length of the parifh is ten com- 
puted miles, not including the wide entry of Loch Roag, 
which runs into the heart of the parifla from the weftward ; 
its breadth is nine. miles. The interior part of it is hilly, 
much more fo than any of the other parifhes in the ifland, 
and along the more it is almoft flat. In many of the farms 
along the fea-coaft the foil is fandy ; farther back, it is of 
a thin light kind, mixed with a little clay, and a great 
part of it feems to be the laft ftratum , of mois which has 
been cut away for fuel, and which produces forced crops, 
with the affiftance of fea-weed for manure. — The air is moift, 
and healthy to the inhabitants. The moft prevailing diltem- 
pers are rheumatifm, eryfipelas, cholics, andepilepfy among 
infants from the fifth to the eighth day after their birth ; 
if they are not aflxdted with the difeafe before the eighth 
day, they are not afterwards fubjecl: to it. The furgeon in 
this country declares, that the laft-raentioned diftemper 
proved fatal in every cafe which came within the compre- 
henfion of his knowledge, two only excepted, in which 
the furgeon attended. One of the children which efcaped, 
fufFered fo much from the violent exertions of the mufcles, 
during the continuance of the fits, that its arms and legs 
are diftorted, and the whole frame is in a debilitated ftate, 
and likely to continue fo. It is worthy of remark, that 
the infants of fuch parents as come to this ifland from the 
neighbouring continent or iflands, or from any part of Bri- 
tain, are not troubled with this affliction, until fuch partnts 
refide for many years in this country ; and indeed few of 
them are at all troubled with it. This diftemper prevails 
over all the ifland. — This parifh abounds with fmall lakes 
and rivulets ; trouts are to be found in all the lakes, but 
fomewhat inferior in tafte and flavour to thofe on the main- 
land. There are four rivulets in which fulmon are caught 
jn fmall quantities, and ufed by the inhabitants. — The

length of the coaft, following the fhore in all its windings 
around Loch Roag, is 40 computed miles ; the more is 
rocky. Dogfilh, cod, ling, and colefifh are abundant 
here. Great quantities of herrings, of uncommonly large 
iize, have begun to be caught in this loch within thele few 
years. The herrings make their appearance about the 20th 
of December, and remain to the middle of January ; this 
laft year, (1794), upwards of 90 fail came from different 
parts of the kingdom; they both fiftied, and bought the 
herring frefh from the country-people, at the great price of 
from 9 3. to 12 s. per crane, ^which is the full of a barrel 
of green fifh, as taken out of the net). The uncommon 
gales of wind which prevailed this winter, became fatal to 
fome of the fifhers, and rendered their fuccefjs upon the 
whole much lefs than it was any year lince the fifhing laft 
commenced. Forty years back, and long before, there 
was an immenfe herring-fifhing in Loch Roag. Sweden 
was then the only market for the fifh, and the abundance 
was fuch, that the country-people fold them for 1 s. per 
forefaid crane. The cod is yery plentiful in this loch du- 
ring the herring-fifhing, and when the herrings emigrate, 
they foon difappear. The cods are fold frefh by the coun- 
try-people at 2 d. each. Such of the inhabitants as incline 
to take the trouble of curing them, can be fupplied with 
fait for the purpofe from two ftorehoufes erecled there hy 
Mr Mackenzie of Seaforth, in which fait is kept for the 
benefit of the people. Mufcles are found fo plentiful that 
lime is made pf their fhells. Oyflers, clams, and coc- 
kles, are found here, There are about 140 tons of kelp 
annually made at Loch Roag, which is fuperior in quality 
to any other kelp in the Highlands of Scotland ; this is fuf- 
ficiently evinced by its felling for at leaf! a guinea per ton 
more than any other kelp. — Gallan head is one of the 
chief promontories; it lies at the fouth-weft entry to Loch 



Roag. The Flannan Tiles lie in a north-weft direaion from 
GaUan-hcad, about 12 cr 15 miles in the ocean ; they are 
not inhabited, and are famous for fattening iheep, each of 
which have always at a time two lambs every feafon, 1 he 
iuands are feven in number, and are the fame which Bu- 
channan calls Infulse Sacrae, becaufe they teem to have been 
the refidence of ecclefiaftics in time of the druids ; fome 
of their temples, built without any mortar, are (Hll extant. 
Sheep brought from thole ifles do not live for any time on 
the continent of Lewis. The people of the farms to which 
the ifles are conneded, go there once a-year to fleece their 
iheep, and to kill fea-fowls, both for food, and on account 
of their feathers. In the iuands there is to be found, in the 
fummer feafon, a migratory bird, called by Martin colk, 
by others edder duck, famous for its elaftic down, which it 
plucks off its own breaft,and with which it lines the neft. — 
Loch Roag, being the only one worthy of particular notice, 
is two leagues acrofs at" the entry, and runs up in a fouth- 
eaft direction about 12 miles through the ifland. This 
loch is covered with iflands, feveral of them inhabited, and 
one of them is about eight miles long its name is Large 
Bernera. The whole of this curious loch abounds with 
fafe places of anchorage, fufficient to hold the whole Bri- 
tifti navy, nay, I may fay the navy of Europe. The 
whole parilh is covered with heath, except the inhabited 
grounds at the fea-fide.

There are at prefent more inftances of longevity here 
(as is always the cafe) than in any other parifh in the 
ifland ; feverals near 90, artd fome above that age, are at pre- 
fent alive. They marry very young, and barrennefs is 
fcarcely known. — All the people dwell in little farm-villa- 
ges, and they fifh in the fummer-feafon* The women do not 
fifli ; but almoft at all times, when there is occafion to go 
to fea, they never decline that fervice, and row powerfully. 
When they go to the hills with their cattle, all defcriptions 
of fex and age angle on the frefh-water lakes. All the 
woollen and linen cloth ufed for common purpbfes is fpun 
and wove in the parifh. There is only one furgeon in the 
whole ifland. All the inhabitants are of the Eftablifhed 
Church. In the parifh are four or five boat-carpenters, 

and 



ofUig. 

and feveral perfons who make broags of leather tanned by 
the inhabitants with tormentil-root.-There are no m- 
ftances known of fuicide.-Many of the people m the pa- 
rifli are employed in manufacturing kelp, and many ot 
them go for the fame purpofe to Harris and Uift.— There 
are no trees to be feen, nor any kind of bruihwood. 

Agriculture^-Tte parifti never fupplies itfelf. with fuf- 
ficiency of provifion. The people have lately acquired a 
fuperior knowledge and prance of the culture of potatoes 
to what they formerly had, and in proportion to the m- 
creafe of this ufefol root, their buying of provifion dkni- 
nifties, and bears a fmall proportion to their outlays in for- 
mer years. About 15 years ago, the prefent minifter was 
obliged to give over the cultivation of potatoes, except a 
little for his own private domeftic ufe, becaufe prejudices 
hindered the people from eating them ; but his perfeve- 
rance in ufing them in his own family at laft convinced the 
people of their error, and of the vaft utility of that article. 
A fmall quantity of flax and hemp is fown in different 
parts of the parifh, owing to the particular attention of Mrs 
'Mackenzie of Seaforth, who makes exertions to direct the 
induftry of the females of this and the other parilhes of the 
ifland to fuitable objects, and has erefted, at a confiderable 
expence, three fpinning-fchools in this parifti. Here they 
fow fmall or black oats (the only kinds ufed) in the months 
of March and April ; they reap in September and Octo- 
ber ; they fow here a little earlier than in any other part of 
the country, in order to be employed in manufacturing 
kelp as foon as poflible. Barley is fown in May, and reap- 
ed in the latter end of Auguft, and fome of it in Septem- 
ber. The oats are all cut with the fickle, but the barley 
is plucked ; the reafon for their plucking the latter is, that 
the root of it makes good thatch for their houfes ; and al- 
though 



Statiftical Account 



though they pluck it in rain j weather, when they cannot 
carry on any other harveft work, it never heats, and is eaiily 
dried with the firft fair weather. Kail or cabbage of any 
kind is not ufed here ; fince their prejudice againit potatoes 
has been overcome, they chufe to bellow their manure on 
the latter rather than the former. The minifter is in a fi- 
milar predicament. That part of the parifh which lies far- 
theft out to the ocean is very deftitute of fea ware ; the in- 
terior parts are abundantly fupplied with cut ware for ma- 
nure. 

Language — The Gaelic is the only language fpoken, ex- 
cept by a few tackfmen ; but it is to be hoped, that the 
Englifh language, and, of courfe, the knowledge of books, 
fliall become more prevalent, as two fchools were lately 
erected in the parifh— The names of places are derived 
from the Norwegian or Icelandic tongues, fuch as Kenvick, 
Kirkiboft, &amp;c. 

Church.— -The value of the minifler's living, including 
the glebe, and after a late and voluntary augmentation of 
ftipend given by the proprietor, is L. 80. The King is 
patron. Hugh Munro is minifter ; he is the third fince the 
erection of the parifh. Macleod and Normand Morifon 
were his predeceflbrs. The prefent incumbent has been 
fixteen years fettled ; he is a widower, and has three daugh- 
ters and one fon. The manfe was built about fourteen 
years ago. Two kirks were built two years ago. Sea- 
forth is fole proprietor. 

Poor. — There are 50 poor people who afk alms among 
the parifhioners. Mrs Mackenzie of Seaforth gives L.5 
annually to meliorate their condition, and the mulcts of de- 
3 linquents 



ofUig, 287 

Hnquents are laid out to the fame purpofe. All the people 
are remarked for a charitable difpofition. 

Price of Labour A boat-carpenter here gets 1 s. a-day 

and his vi&amp;uals; a mafon the fame; a male-fervant has 
L 2 p er annum, with coarfe fhoes, and his victuals ; a fe- 
male-fervant from 5 s. to 10 s. annually, with ihoes and vic- 
tuals. There is not a plough in the parifh ; all the tillage 

is conducted with crooked and ftraight fpades. No carts 
nor waggons. The fuel is wholly peat. 

Druidical Temple, life. — At a place called Calarnifli, not 
far from Loch Roag, there is an entire druidical place of 
worlhip, of which I fubjoin a Iketch :

At Melifta are the remains of a nunnery, called ftill i n 
the language of the country, T eagh na n cailichan dou, or, 
The houfe of the old black women. At Carlaway there is 
a Danifti fort, or doune, with a double wall of dry ftone ,■ it 
is, perhaps, the moft entire of any of the kind in Scotland ; 
it is very broad at the bafe, and towards the top contracts 
in the form of a pyramid ; the height of the wall is 30 
feet; the fabric is perfectly circular.— In ancient times 
there were many battles fought in this parifh between the 
Macaulays and Morifons, who had perpetual feuds. 

This parifh gave birth to the father of Alderman Mac- 
aulay, now living in London, whofe uncle George Mac- 
aulay is ftill at Calarnifli. The people of this parifh are 
remarked for their cleanlinefs and hofpitality more than 
their equals in any other part of the ifland.-^-The number 
of boats is not below a hundred. — Two or three open boats 
go annually from this parilh to Glafgow with falted beef, 
dry falted fifh, tallow, &amp;c. — The people are very economi- 
cal, and are not fond of a military life. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations. — If manufactures were intro* 
duced here upon a great fcale, they would tend to melio* 
rate the condition of the people, becaufe fuch employment 
would afford bread to the increafe of population which pre- 
vails here, as well as in all the parilhes of the Highlands.— * 
Very near the manfe there live9 a woman, who has four di-» 
ftinct breafts or mammae. She has had feveral flout healthy 
children, and fuckled each of them, and likewife one of the 
minifter's children. She has nipples and milk in each of 
the four breafts ; the two upper are fituated immediately 
under the arm-pits, and by being diftended with milk, are 
very troublefome to her for the firft two or three months 
after her delivery. Such a lufus natures is very uncom- 
mon.

PARISH OF RHYNIE AND ESSIE, 



(County of Aberdeen, Synod of Moray, Presbytery 

of Strathbogie). 



From Communications ly the Rev. Mr James Milne.</head> 



<p>Name, &amp;c. 

r T"HE parifhes of Rhynie and Effie were united at a re- 
mote period. The church of Effie was continued as 
a place of worfhip till about 30 years ago, when it became 
ruinous ; fince that time the parifli has been generally 
known by the name of Rhynie only. It is fituated in the 
county of Aberdeen, Synod of Moray, and Prefbytery of 
Strathbogie. This prefbytery was disjoined from the fy- 
nod of Aberdeen, and annexed to that of Moray in 1700 : 
A disjunction the more remarkable, that feveral of the pa- 
riflies were in the county of Aberdeen, and one of them, 
Mortlich, was originally the feat of the bilhoprick, which 
was afterwards removed to Old Aberdeen.

Boundaries. 



2 9® Btatijim Account 

Boundaries.— The parifh of Rhynie is bounded by the 
panfhes of Cairnie, Cabrach, Auchindore, and Gartly. 

Extent and Contents, Vc.-The figure of the parilh is 
nearly fquare, it being 5 Englifh miles long, and nearly as 
broad. It contains 8 of the 48 davachs or davochs of the 
lordfliip of Strathbogie. A davach contains 32 oxen- 
gates * of 13 acres each, or 416 acres of arable land. At 
this, rate, the whole lordfliip of Strathbogie anciently was 
eftimated at 19,968 acres, or, in round numbers, 20,000 
acres of arable land. About one-third of this is infield or 
croft-land, and two-thirds outfield. 

Lord/hip of Strathbogie.—- As this lordfliip was one of 
the five divifions of the county of Aberdeen, anciently 
called Lordlliips or Thanages, as it included the whole ori- 
ginal eftate which King Robert Bruce gave to the noble 
family of Gordon, and as it has been overlooked by Dr 
Anderfon in his Survey of the County of Aberdeen, the 
writer of this account thinks himfelf bound to take notice 
pf it. The whole lordfliip of Strathbogie comprehends 
120 fquare miles, including both the arable and unculti- 
vated lands. It lies on both fides of the river Bogie, 
which empties itfelf into the Deveron, near Huntly. In 
1424, when the proprietor of it was one of the hoftages for 
the ranfom of King James I. his rental was ftated to be 
L. 400 Scotch money of that age, while the eftates of the 

High 

* By act of federunt, March 11. 1585, an oxengate, or oxgate, contains 
13 acres, 4 oxengate a twenty-fhilling land, 8 oxengate a forty-ftiilling 
land. Some pf the oxengates in the lordfhip of Strathbogie are not 
6 acres; others above jo acres. — The hills are lefs cultivated, and the low 
grounds, formerly in wood, are now more in culture. That has probably 
pecafioned the inequality. Therefore, in the above account, the legal mea- 
fures of a davoch and oxgate are preferred to indefinite meafures. 



of Rhyne and EJfid igi 

High Conftable of Scotland, afterwards Earl of Errol, and 
of the Great Marifchal, afterwards Earl Marifchal, were 
only valued at L. 800 Scotch each. 

The parifh of Rhyme lies in the fouth-weft extremity of 
this lordfhip, and of the ftrath of Strathbogie. The foil 
of the parifh is various ; loamy near the river Bogie ; 
ftonny and gravelly, yet very fertile, near the bottom of 
the hills ; and in fome low grounds a clay, in others a mof- 
fy foil. Agriculture has not yet made great advances, 
there being only about ten acres of turnip, and 40 acres of 
fown grafs, in the whole of this extenfive pariih. Yet the 
farmers are beginning to improve, their lands ; and to en- 
able them to do fo, there is abundance of limeflone in fomd 
of the neighbouring parifhes. 

Mountain. — Though there are feveral hills, there is only 
one of thefe which deferves the name of a mountain. It 
is called the hill of Noth ; and is of a conical fhapej fpring- 
ing from its bafe about 600 feet, and atleaft 1000 feet above 
the level of the fea. The whole parifl? is elevated above 
that level at lealt 400 feet. As a proof of this elevation, 
the river Gady rifes near the borders of this parifh, and 
after falling into the Ury, and along with it into the Don, 
runs into the fea at Aberdeen, after a courfe of 30 miles 
to the fouth-eaft ; and the river Bogie, which runs through 
the parifh, after mixing its waters with the Dcveron, and 
running alfo nearly 30 miles in a north-well dirediotl, falls 
into the Moray Frith at Banff. 

Population, Refit, i?c. — The number of perfohs in this 
parifh is 681 ; but, according to Dr Webfter's lift in 1755, 
it amounted to 836. The number ofhorfes, 172 ; of black- 
cattle, 882 ; and of fheep, 2255.— The rent of the parifh 
is about L. 700. The minifter's ftipend is two chalders of 

meal,

Statijlical Account 



meal, and L. 74 : 8 : io T 8 x . The fehoolmafter's falary is 
7t bolls of meal, which is paid in fmall quantities by the 
tenants. The colledions for the poor, including what is 
made at the communion, amount to about L. 8 yearly, 
which, with the intereft of L.15 of funded money, and 
from L. 3 to L. 4 of feat-rents, has been found adequate to 
their fupply. 

Heritors, \£c. — The whole parifh is now the property of 
the Duke of Gordon, who is patron of Rhynie : But Earl 
Fife, as patron of Effie, has a vice patronage of the united 
parifhes. 

Antiquities. — On the top of Noth are, according to Mr 
Williams, Dr Anderfon, and others, the remains of a vi- 
trified fort. Some, however, are of opinion, that this is 
only the mouth of an extinguifhed volcano. The conical 
lhape of the jhill favours the idea of a volcano ; but the 
Hones and remains of a building are rather favourable to 
the fuppofition of a vitrified fort. — There is a tradition of a 
battle having been fought at a remote period about the 
middle of this parifh. And a large Hone, about five feet 
diameter, on which there are fome hieroglyphical charac- 
ters, and franding on the moor of Rhynie, is faid to have 
been ere&amp;ed in memory of the engagement. Part of this 
{lone has been lately broken : But it is certainly very an- 
cient. 

Eminent Men. — As this was the feat of a great many of 
the Gordons during the feuds of the clans, this parifh gave 
birth to many brave fellows, eminent in days of turbulence, 
but now configned to oblivion. Two anecdotes relative 
to the hiflory of thofe times are, however, worth preferving. 

Huntly's fecond fon got the lands of Scurdarg in this, and 

afterwards 



efRhynie and Effle. 293 



afterwards thofe of Pitlurg in a neighbouring parifti. The 
male heir of the Earl failed in the time of James III. and 
the heirels was married to a younger fon of the Lord 
Seton, afterwards Earl of Winton. Mr Seton was created 
Earl of Huntly, and was a man of great abilities. When 
the Earls of Douglas and Crawford had joined in a league 
which ihook the throne, Lord Huntly, who was Lieutenant 
of the North, led on his troops to the battle of Brechin. 
But in marking out the commanders of the clans, he appoint- 
ed his fecond fon, the laird of Gtght, to head the Gordons. 
According to the ideas of that age, the Earl himfelf was 
only a Seton, and Pitlurg was chief of the Gordons. The 
clan, therefore, infilling that Pitlurg Ihould march at their 
head, he applied to Lord Huntly, and claimed his right. 
Huntly refufed ; and Pitlurg took off his black bonnet *, and 
waving it, cried, " A' that's come o me, follow me;" imme- 
diately the whole clan went off with him, and left Huntly 
alone. The Earl, with admirable prefence of mind, came 
up to them, and faid, " Gentlemen, you have overcome 
«' me ; I yield it to you. Pitlurg, command the Gordons. 
" And now, Gentlemen, that you have got the better of 
" me, let me fee if you will beat Lord Crawford." The 
Gordons, in high agitation of fpirits, attacked the enemy ; 
and Earl Huntly, after a mo ft glorious and important vic- 
tory, got the lands of Badenoch and Lochaber, for hadding 
(holding) the Crown on the King's Head. From that mo- 
ment the family of Huntly became the greateft in the 
north •, and this contention with the clan, by making them 
feel bold, was fuppofed to have contributed not a littfe to 
the vi&amp;ory at Brechin. 

The 



* A black bonnet, anciently the drefs of a Highland Chieftain, is now 
worn by the mooilaud farmers in Mid-Lothian, to diitinguilli them from 
their fervants. 



2 94 Statijlical Account 

The other anecdote regards a fecond fon of PitW who 
got the ands of Cairnborrow. The day before the battle 
of Glenlivet, the Marquis of Huntly came to Cairnborrow 
and applied to his lady, who was fuppofed to rule the roaft' 
for her affiftance. She faid, me had got Ihort warning 
but that her old man, with his eight fons, with a jackman 
and a footman to each, mould attend him immediately. 
Huntly thanked her ; and after fome more convention 
With her, defired Cairnborrow, who had never fpoke a word, 
to ftay at home, telling him, that at his advanced years it 
was not proper to take him along, especially as he had fo 
many of his fons. The old man heard him out, and drug- 
ging up his moulders, faid, " Na, na, my Lord, I'll blend 
" the whelps my fell; they'll bite the better." This was at 
once the reply of a fportfman and a foldier ; and the whole 
family went to battle with the laird at their head. They 
defeated Argyle, and returned all fafe to Cairnborrow *. 
In mountainous diftricls, fentiments of liberty, and of per- 
fonal bravery, are very prevalent. 

Advantages of the Parifh of Rhynie — Thefe are, good 
foil in general, and fhelter from the high hills, which ren- 
ders the greater part of the cultivated lands very warm and 
fertile. 

Difadvantnges. 

* The writer of this 'account has been favoured with a curious manu- 
fcript, in which the names of the father, mother, and eight fons, are all 
mentioned : "John Gorden of Caimborne married Beffiov Gordon, daughter 
" to the Laird of Buckie, with whom he begat eight fons and three daugh- 
« ters. His fons were, ift, John, laird of Caimborne, afterwards of Edin- 
" glaflie; 2. George Gorden of Sorbach ; 3. James Gorden of Fermaghtie; . 
« 4. William, who coft (bought) Cairnborrow; 5. Mr Arthur Gorden; 
« 6. Thomas Gorden of Aitloch ; 7. Robert Gorden of Gollachie; 8. Pa- 
rt trick Gorden of Craigfton in Sutherland. All thefe. with their f.ither, and 
» riine jackmen and as many foot:nen, went to Glenlivet br.tlle." 



ofRhynie and Effte* 395 

Difadvantages.—Thek are, the diftance from market, 
want of capital in many of the farmers, and, in fome cafes, 
mill-multures ; but thefe laft are all, by the Duke of Gor- 
don, to be aboliftied, when the prefent leafes expire ; and 
the carrying up a canal from Aberdeen to the head of the 
Garioch, or from Huntly to Rhynie, will in time render 
the markets more accefiible. 

Chara&amp;er of the People. — They are fober, induftrious, 
peaceable, and contented with their condition. They en-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q323196">ABOYNE</name> AND <name ref="NA">GLENTANAR</name>, 

(County and Synod of Aberdeen, Presbytery of 

Kincardine). 

By a Friend to Statijlical Inquiries.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE origin of the name of Aboyne is unknown. That 
of Gientanar is evidently derived from the rivulet 
Tanar, and fignifies the glen or hollow occafioned by that 
rivulet. 

Gientanar and Infchmarnoch, at a remote period, made 
one parifli j but, from the poornefe of the living, they were 
disjoined, and Infchmarnoch was funk in the united pa- 
rilhes of Glenmuick, Glengorn, and Tullich. Gientanar 
was united to Aboyne •, but after the building of a centrical 
church at Aboyne, the name of Gientanar was alfo funk; 
and the pariih is now generally known by the name of 
Aboyne. 

Situation, 



of Aboyne and Glentanar. 297 



Situation, Extent, ISc. — Thefe parifhes are fituated in 
the county and fynod of Aberdeen, and prefbytery of Kin- 
cardine. The church is 30 Englifti miles fouth-vveft 
ffomi Aberdeen, and nearly the fame diftance north-weft 
from Brechin. The cultivated part of thefe pariihes ex- 
tends four miles from eaft to weft, and three miles from 
north to fouth ; but the hills of Glentanar extend five miles 
farther to the fouth-weft. The river Dee is generally the 
boundary between the two parifhes, Glentanar lying on the 
fouth, and Aboyne on the north of that river. Only the 
lands of Balnacraig, and two infulaced farms in the parifh, 
of Aboyne, furrounded on all fides by the parifh of Birfe, 
are fituated on the fouth bank of the Dee. The pariih of 
Lochlee, in the county of Angus, whofe church is above 16 
miles from that of Aboyne, bounds this parifh on the fouth- 
weft. In the county of Aberdeen it is bounded by the pa- 
rifhes of Glenmuick, Tullich, Coul, Coldftone, Logie, Kin- 
cardine, and Birfe. 

Ancient Divi/ion of the County. — The different hills which 
nature has marked out as barriers, were the ancient boun- 
daries of comities and diftricls. In modern times, the di- 
vifion by rivers has gained ground. But in thefe parifhes 
the county of Aberdeen crofles the river Dee, and follows 
the divifion by hills ; and in this difiric~r., the ideas of a High- 
lander ftill favour the divifion by hills and mountains. The 
people uniformly call all that extent of ground which is 
bounded by the fenfible horizon by the name of a country. 

Mountains. — The parifh of Aboyne has no confiderable 
hills. Glentanar is altogether hilly, and approaches to 
mountainous. The higheft mountain of Glentanar, called 
the Fir Month, is about 2500 feet above the level of the fea j 
and commands a profpeft of Aberdeen, Montrofe, and Ar- 

Vot. XIX. Pp broath.

broath. Another of thefe mountains, Month Kean y is 
feen from the coaft of Buchan, at the diftance of above 40 
miles, and fcrves as a barometer to the interjacent country. 
When the conical top of Month Kean is covered with a 
cloud, the people in the lower parts of the county feldom 
fail to have rain within 24, or at raoft 36 hours. 

Rivers. — The principal river, which runs through the 
whole extent of thefe parifties, is the Dee, which abounds 
in falmon, fea-trout, and burn-trout, or frefh-water trout. 
Thefe are only caught with the rod, and fell at from 3 d. to 
4 d. per lb. according to the feafon of the year. The infe- 
rior rivers are the Feuch, which runs along the lands fur- 
rounded by the parilh of Birfe, and falls into the Dee about 
12 miles below Aboyne; the Tanar, and the Allachy, 
which runs into the Tanar, and along with it falls into the 
Dee about a mile above Aboyne. All thefe rivers are re- 
markably clear, but very rapid, and fwell fuddenly to a 
great degree, which renders them very dangerous. 

Woods. — Befides a considerable quantity of different 
kinds of wood planted in the parifli of Aboyne, there is a 
very large forefl of natural wood in Glentanar, the greateft 
length of which is ten, and the breadth fix Englifli miles. 
This foreft produces Scotch fir (a fpecies of pine) of a very 
good quality, which grows on the fides of the hills ; but 
from the great elevation, no wood grows near the top of the 
higheft mountains. There is a great demand for this wood, 
which brings Lord Aboyne from L.400 to L. 5^0 yearly. 
It was fold, till lately, at 3 d. per cubic foot ; but for fome 
years pad at 4 d. in lots, or prizing*, as they call it, and in 
picked trees at 5 d. per cubic foot; within thefe few weeks 
(in June 1796) it has been raifed to 6 d. the foot. The 
axe-men are particularly alert in picking out and cutting 

down 



of Aboyne and Glentanar. 299 



down the largeft trees. But the expence of getting them 
out of the foreft is very confiderable ; and as the trees are 
always fquared with the axe, the wood is not fo economi- 
cally managed, as if there were a faw-mill, and proper ma- 
chinery for carrying the large logs from the foreft. As a 
proof of the fineneis of the wood, the writer of this account 
numbered 130 concentric circles on a tree of 11 inches 
diameter *. 

A Canal propofed. — If a canal could be made out from 
Aberdeen to Aboyne, this extenfive foreft would produce 
L. 1500 a-year to the proprietor. Perhaps fuch a canal is 
not only practicable, but could be made at much lefs ex- 
pence than might be expected 1 , from the rapidity of the 
rivers, and the great elevation of the parifh of Aboyne j 
but it ftiould not be attempted near the banks oi the Dee. 
The writer of this account believes, that by railing a canal 
from Aberdeen at once to the level of Hazlehead, there 
would be almoft a dead level, and at any rate, no occalion 
for more than one lock, for fix miles above Hazlehead. This 
canal ftiould probably be carried paft Cannieglirach, Hirn, 
Rameir, Glaffel, and Kincardine. A branch of it could 
be conducted paft Skene, Ciuny, Monymulk, and perhaps 
nearly to Alford ; and till the increaling commerce of the 
county enabled the proprietors to make out locks from 
Hazlehead to Aberdeen, a diftance of two miles, a carriage- 
way could be ufed at a moderate expence. With a little 
more public fpirit, and alfo by laying out their money 
with economy, the proprietors of land in Aberdeenlhire 
may make out canals, where they at prefent account them 

impracticable. 

* The foreft of Glentanar has been twice burned ; once, as was fuppo- 
fed, by accident. The young wood fuffercd, but the old wood received no 
hurt, except being a little finged.

imprafticable. And from the great extent of wafte or unr 
improved land, on which a very fmall quantity of lime 
would operate, they would foon be indemnified by the rife 
of their rents for the expence of any canal which was con- 
ducted on rational principles. In the parilh of Aboyne, in 
particular, from the rife of both the rent of the lands, and 
of the price of wood, a canal to Aberdeen would be at- 
tended with molt beneficial efiecTs. 

Soil and Agriculture. — Much cannot be faid in behalf of 
either of thefe. The foil of both parilhes is fandy or gra- 
velly. In fome parts it is loamy, but very little of a clay 
foil is found in either of thefe pariflies. In rainy feafons 
aDundant crops are produced ; but it has long been obfer- 
ved, that Dee fide needs a fiiower every 24 hours, from 
May to Auguft. And in very dry feafons, from the qua- 
lity and thinnefs of the foil, this diftric~t is very deficient 
both in corn and ftraw. Harvefts, of courfe, are earlier 
than in moft parts of the county. When the foil of the 
lands adjacent to the two principal rivers of Aberdeenfliire, 
the Dee and Don, are compared, the latter has manifeftly 
the advantage on the whole. Hence the old rhyme, 

A foot of Don's worth two of Dee, 
Except it be for fifti and tree. 

The inhabitants of this parifh, however, by felling their 
wood, in more diftant parts of the county, at high prices, 
contrive to live comfortably. At the fame time, it muft 
be confeffcd, that this traffic in wood is a lofs to agricul- 
ture ; and fince the introduction of the new hulbandry, this 
diftri£t, which is admirably adapted for raifing barley, tur- 
nips and potatoes, receives yearly a confiderable quantity 
of lime, which goes a great way in the thin foil of this di- 

ftrift.

f A 

ftrict. The application of lime, however, to this foil, fhould 
only be for turnips, potatoes, or bear fown out with gra£s. 
Yet the farmers do fometimes apply it to fucceffive crops 
of oats ; a mode of farming which, if not fpeedily checked, 
muft foon reduce the foil of Dee-fide to a caput mortuum. 
Though, among the farmers in general, there is no rotation 
of crops, nor approved method of hufbandry, yet the Earl 
of Aboyne's perfonal farm is in very high cultivation. It 
confifts of nearly 400 acres, all inclofed by excellent ftone 
fences, lined with hedge -rows, and alternately producing 
white and green crops ; and it proves what can be done, 
even on Dee-fide, by the proper application of foil, manure, 
and good ploughing. 

Population, ifc. — The number of inhabitants is 1050. 
In 1755, by Dr Webfter's account, they were 1695. There 
are four heritors, -viz. The Earl of Aboyne, who is patron, 
and generally refides in the parifh, Mr Jones of Balnacraig, 
Mr Farquharfon of Finzean, and the Earl of Aberdeen, n 
The two laft have only a fmall farm each. The Earl of 
Aboyne is proprietor of five-fixths of the parifh. The 
whole land-rent is about L. 1200. 

Burgh of Barony. — Charleftown of Aboyne is a pleafant 
little town, and a burgh of barony. It had once a weekly 
market. It ftill has four fairs or yearly markets. 

Goat-whey garters. — In the parifh of Glentanar a great 
many goats are kept, and perfons afBicled with confump- 
tions frequently refort to goat-whey quarters in that parifh. 
Goatmilk is fold from 4 d, to 6 d. per pint. It is alfo made 
into cheefe; and is much efteemed by connoiffeurs. 



Antiquities. 



302 



Statiftical Account 



Antiquitzes.-Thzxe is a hill in the parifh of Aboyne 
called Mullach's hill, in which there are a great number of 
cairns, faid to be burial-places, after a great battle, in which 
one Mullach was killed. 

Proprietors of the EJlate of Aboyne.- -This eftate ancient- 
ly belonged to Frafer the thane of C Q wie. The Earl of 
Manfchal married the heirefs of that efiate, and the Mar- 
quis of Huntly her only daughter. Marifchal kept the 
lands of Cowie, and Huntlj got Aboyne, which he gave to 
his fecond fon. That young nobleman was burned to death 
in the houfe of Frendraught, where he and fome of his 
friends were on a vifit. Lady Frendraught was fufpefted 
of having fet fire to that part of the houfe in which he 
lodged ; but it is ftill doubtful whether his death was wil- 
ful or accidental. The eftate and the title of the Earl of 
Aboyne were given to another fon of the family of Hunt- 
]y. But in a few generations, the Earls of Aboyne were 
io much reduced in their circumftances, that the laft Earl 
fent his baggage to Paris, becaufe he faw he could not live 
in Scotland fuitably to his rank. Unwilling, however, to 
abandon his country, he ordered it to be brought back, and 
by attending to the management of his eftate, and the fale 
of his wood, and fele&amp;ing able overfeers for his perfonal 
farm, he foon retrieved his affairs. And after a life, not 
remarkable for its length, but for its activity, intelligence, 
and fteadinefs, he left a clear eftate of L. 6000 a-year to his 
eldeft fon, and another, about the third part of that value, 
to his fecond fon. In an age in which diflipation is fo pre- 
valent, a character of this kind ought to be mentioned with 
refpeft; and in a Statiftical Account, the following parti- 
culars regarding Lord Aboyne's rural economy are worthy 
of notice. — He built eighteen miles of a boundary to his 
farm and plantations. The whole ftone fences, including 

2 fubdivifions, 



of Aboyne and Glentanar. 303 



fubdivifions, mull be at leaft 40 Englifli miles in length, or 
above feventy thoufand yards. The fences are about five 
feet in height, extremely well executed, and were all done 
by days wages, or by men hired by the feafon. He dis- 
approved of building fences by the piece, as they are fel- 
dom durable. He lived in a diftricT" where the price of la- 
bour was low, but where the people were indolent. By 
giving them employment, and introducing overfeers, and a 
few fervants from other places, where agriculture was 
known and induftry pra&amp;ifed, he enabled his people to pay 
the rife of their rents, and taught them how to improve 
their own farms ; and by generally refiding on his eftate, 
his rent was fpent among his tenants, and enabled him to 
command an additional quantity of their labour; at the 
fame time, he was refpe&amp;ed in a much higher degree than 
he would have been, if, in p^ace of fpending his rents in 
ufeful and productive labour, he had either been a prodigal 
abroad, or a mifer who lived at home, but would not part 
with his money to ornament or improve his eftate. It is 
only proper to add, that the writer of this account was un- 
der no obligations to him, and lives 30 miles from Aboyne, 
fo that he can have no motive for ftating thefe fa£fe, but a 
defire to influence our young nobility, and heirs to great 
eftates, to imitate thefe good qualities, and to be at once 
ufeful to themfelves and to fociety. For let it be remem- 
bered, that private vices are not fo great public benefits as 
private virtues are found to be. The eftate of a prodigal 
is often (deftroyed, without employing fo much ufeful la- 
bour, as is exerted in improving the eftate of a man of acti- 
vity, intelligence, and public fpirit. 

Oak Sbip.—lt would be improper to omit mentioning, 
that a ftnp, entirely of oak taken from Lord Aboyne's 

woods, 



3°4 Statijlical Account 



woods, was lately built at Aberdeen. She is called the 
Countefs of Aboyne. It were to be wifhed that more en- 
couragement was given to the raifing of oak than is com- 
monly given in this country. 

CharaEler of the 'People. — They are fober and alert ; but 
not fo patient of labour as the inhabitants of the low coun- 
try. They are generally very decent, and regular in at- 
tending on religious ordinances.

3 oC * Statijlical Account 

Soil and Agriculture.-^ foil of the parifK is various. 
1 he agriculture is, on the whole, pretty well conducted. 
1 hough the parifhjs of fmall extent, yet there are generally 
from 60 to 70 acres of turnips, and 300 acres of fown 
grafs. This parilh was one of the firft in the north of Scot- 
land in which the new hulbandry was attempted, and car- 
ried on with fuccefs. The late Earl of Findlater was the 
author of all thefe early improvements. The farm of 
Craigholes was firft improved by his Lordmip about 1754 ; 
and after improving this farm, to mew what could be done, 
he took every method of exciting his tenants to follow his 
example. He gave them long leafes of 38 years and a life- 
time. A better method could not have been devifed. The 
certain period of 38 years gave his tenants a fecurity for 
carrying on their improvements. The uncertain period at 
which the leafe terminated, naturally deterred them from 
fcourging their farms when once improved, becaufe every 
man flatters himfelf with the hopes of a long life. From the 
example and the encouragement of Lord Findlater, the 
face of this and fome of the neighbouring parifties was 
fpeedily altered. But though turnip and green crops were 
encouraged, and flour- mills were built, yet a regular rota- 
tion of crop has nor been eftablilhed, nor has much wheat 
been raifed in this diftrict. It is probable, however, that 
the high prices of flour will occalion wheat to be raifed in 
greater quantities, though for a light foil a crop of turnips, 
and another of barley, is lefs fcourging, and generally more 
productive than the fouth country practice of fallow and 
wheat. 

Rent. — The rent of the parifli is moftly in victual, and 
varies from L. 1000 to L, 1210. 



Population. 



of Boyndie. 307 

Population. — The number of inhabitants is 126c •, of 
which there are 8co nearly in the country parilh, and 460 
in the fea-town of Whitehills. The population in 1755, is 
Hated by Dr Webfter at 994 fouls. 

Sea-town. — The town of Whitehills is chiefly inhabited 
by fifliers. There are feven boats employed in the filhery ; 
and they are generally very fuccefsful. The kinds of fifth, 
principally caught are cod, ling, and haddocks; and be- 
sides conliderable quantities fold in the town of Banff, and 
in the country around, the fifliers generally carry every 
year to the Frith of Forth cod and ling to the amount of 
L. 500 or L. 600. 

Stipend, ifc— The minifter's ftipend is, in money, L. 39, 
and in visual, 60 bolls. The collections for the poor 
amount to about L. 25 yearly, including the intereft of 
L. 200 of lent money. The fchoolmafter's falary is only 
9 bolls of meal. 

CharaEier of the People.— -They are fober, induftrious, and 
charitable. From the long leafes, and reafonable rents of 
the farms in this parilh, the people have not that fpur to 
exertion which racked rents produce for a feafon. But 
they have every inducement to fteady and regular induftry, 
which improves both their bodies and their minds; and 
they are ftrangers to that defpondency, laffitude, and dif- 
guft, which, after a few years unavailing exertion, take pof- 
feffion of the difpirited, hard-toiling, and difcontented far- 
mer who ,s opprcfled by a rack-rent and fhort leafe, and 
*t aft becomes carelefs of every thing, when he fees, that 
w.th all his induftry, he is unable to pay his landlord and

(County and Synod of Argyle, Presbytery of 

Inverary.) 

From Materials communicated ly fome Gentlemen 
in the Parijh.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, l£c. 

THAT portion of Argylefhire, which is contained be 7 
tween the ifthmi of Crinan and Tarbert, is known 
by the general appellation oiKnapdale, or Cnapadale, a term 
it owes to the ftriking inequality of its furface. It is bound- 
ed on the north by the loch of Crinan, and track of the in- 
tended canal; on the eaft by Lochgilp and Lochfine; on 
the fouth by the iilhmus and lochs of Tarbert ; and on the 
fouth-weft and weft by the Sound of Jura. Its extreme 
length from north to fouth is about 18 miles, and its great- 



of South Knapdaki 



309 



eft breadth from 10 to 12. It is interfefted from the fouth 
by the lochs of Caolifport and Caftlefwen. The firft, and 
moft eafterly, penetrates about four miles into the coun- 
try, -and derives its name from its narrownefs. The fecond 
owes its title to a caftle, fituated near its mouth; which, to- 
gether with others on the weftern coaft, were ereded as 
fortreffes by Swen, the Danifh conqueror. The loch ha- 
ving paffed this place about two miles, fends off a branch 
to the weflward ; and continuing its courfe for two or three 
miles farther, expands fuddenly, and i'plits at once into fe- 
veral branches, refembling the palm, thumb, and fingers of 
the hand. The intervals between thefe branches are finely 
diverfified with woods, rocks, fields, and meets of water, 
which, viewed from the road leading from Inverluffay to 
Glaffory, exhibit an affemblage of contrarieties fo wildly 
grotefque, that fancy can hardly image a landfcape more ex- 
quifitely delightful. The divifion of Knapdale weftward 
of this loch, called Rofs, is of excellent quality. Could the 
foil and roeks, with which it is unfortunately interfperled, be 
feparated, there would not perhaps be a more fertile fpot in 
Scotland. The country to the eaftward, if we except the 
eftates of Caftlefwen and Knap, the low grounds of Inver- 
neil, Ceannlochcaolifport and Ormfary, the extenfive plains 
round Kilberry Caftle, and a. few patches along the fea- 
coafts, forms a counter-part to that of Rofs. It fwells into 
high and rugged mountains, incrufted with mofs, and fhroud- 
ed with heath. The fhore, however, where not arable, 
is generally covered with wood •, which furnifhes excellent 
fhelter, and proves very convenient for the winter-pafture 
of black cattle. 

Knapdale, to the fouth-weft, juts out into three great pro- 
montories or headlands. The moft wefterly is called the 
point of Kilvicoharmaig. Its figure is fomewhat like that 
of a crefcent, between which and the beautiful peninfula of

-Danna lies the harbour of Lochnakille, an anchorage well

ohfport is the centre promontory, or point of Knap- and 
the point of Ardpatrick is formed by a bay to the north- 
weft, and the weft loch of Tarbert to the fouth. 

Eccleftajlical State of the Pari/h.-This country was for- 
rnerly a parfonage dependant upon the abbots of Kilwinning 
When, at the Reformation, that abbacy was converted in- 
to a temporal lordfhip, a large triangle of Knapdale, adja- 
cent to the mouth of Weft Lochtarbert, was annexed to 
Kilcolmonel. The remainder was erefted into a parifh 
confifting of fix feveral places of worflnp, among which 
the paftor performed a fort of conftant itineracy. The 
inconveniency of a charge fo extenhve, and fo interfered 
by arms of the fea, was equally felt by the minifter and 
people ; and, upon application being made about 75 years 
ago, the parifti of Knapdale was divided into the parifties 
of South and North Knapdales, by a line of feparation ori- 
ginating at the more, fouth of Caftlefwen, riling about a 
mile due eaft, and running north along the mountains till 
it terminates in the traft of the canal, a mile eaft of Loch- 
Crinan. By this partition, the whole point of Knap, and 
£len of Caolifport, was included in South Knapdale ; but, 
though it had acquired nearly double the extent, the fu- 
periority of North Knapdale fitted it to fupply the occa- 
fions of a much greater population. 

Ancient Proprietors, l$c. — Power alone, in the ruder 
ages of fociery, conftituted a right. No other title was ne- 
ceffary, either to its acquifition or maintenance. The Mac- 
millans were anciently proprietors of Kilhamacgand Knap. 
The lad of the name, to prevent the proftitution of his 
wife, butchered her admirer, and was himfelf obliged to

abfcond. His charter was infcribed in the Gaelic language 
and character upon a rock at the extremity of his eftate. 
It proved but a feeble fecurity againft the rapacity of a 
barbarous' age. The property was contefted for by the 
Campbells and Macneils, the latter of whom were a power- 
ful clan in North Knapdale, and decided in favour of the 
former by compromife. It continued in the fame family 
till the year 1775, when, after the death of the tenth pof- 
feflbr, the eftate was purchafed by the late Lieutenant-Ge- 
neral Sir Archibald Campbell of Inverneil. The fword of 
Macmillan is faid to be ftill in prefer vation. But it is fin- 
cerely to be regretted, that the infcription was defaced by a 
collateral of the Knap family about 30 years ago. Unlefs 
prompted by the vanity of having his anceftors confidered 
in future as the aborigines of their property, it is difficult 
to affign a probable motive to an aclion fo gothic. Mac- 
millan 's mode of inveftment, in heritable right, is not with- 
out precedent. The Macmurachies, of old, were proprie- 
tors of Terdigan and Kilberrie, lying in that part of Knap- 
dale annexed to Kilcolmonel. Their charter is alfo engra- 
ved, in the fame language and charader, upon a rock near 
the more of thefe lands. From this very ancient family, 
if we may credit the popular legend of the country, is de- 
fended the prefent, but unfortunate, royal line of France". 
Macmafter of Ceannlochcaolifport, Achahoilh, and Ellary, 
became mailers of thefe lands, at a very early period, by the 
murder of Macavern, the ancient proprietor. A pool of 
the river, where he was a-filhing at the time, and cairn 
where he fell, ierve to perpetuate the memory of the fatal

ing depredators. Their eftate was fold by Ronald, the 
laft of the race, to the late Sir James Campbell of Achna- 
breck, and by him conveyed to Campbell of Shirven, in 
the pofleffion of whofe family it now is. The Macneils 
and Macmillans, after having eftablimed themfelves along 
the eaftern coaft of Caolifport, were gradually fupplanted 
by the Campbells. The former found means to preferve 
the property of two or three farms in that part till towards 
the beginning of this century, when they were excambion- 
ed, with the then Argyle, for the illand of Coluflhay. But 
by far the moll confiderable family in South Knapdale was 
the Macalafters of Tarbert. Cantire was at that time held 
by the Macdonalds ; and the Macalafters, who are allowed 
to be a tribe of that clan, poffefled almoft all the lands 
around Tarbert, and along the eoaft of Lochfine and Loch- 
gilp, to the extremity of the parim. They were interrupt- 
ed in the pofleffion of their property by the Macivers, a 
reftlefs tribe of the Campbells, inhabiting a part of Glaflary, 
who effedled a fettlement, and erefted a fort of fort on the 
weft fide of Lochgilp. 

The inroads of thefe invaders were, for fome time, ex- 
tremely vexatious to their fouthern neighbours; till at 
length they were overcome, and almoft extirpated in 
two bloody conflicts; firft with the Macneils, near the 
mouth of Weft Loch-Tarbert, and afterwards with the 
Macalafters on the fhore of Lochfine. The ianguinary po- 
licy which deprived the Macdonalds of Cantire, gradually 
diminifhed the authority of the Macalafters. The Mac- 
alafters became mailers of Dael and Craiglafc, now the pro- 
perty of Macarthur Stewart of Milton-, and a Peter Dow 
Campbell, taking the title of Kildufclan, of all their other 
lands north of Inverneil. Thefe lands, after paffing through 
the hands of the Campbells of Barnicarry and Alkenul, 
were purchafed, about three years ago, by Mr Macnc.I.

late writer at Inverary. Four other farms, belonging to the 
Macalafters, in the vicinity of Tarbert, are now in poffeffion 
of Macfarlan of Muckroy \ and three more in that of 
Campbell of Kintarbert. The remainder of the eftate, with 
the manfipn-houle, burnt down by accident about two years 
fince, was purcbafed by the late Mr Campbell of Stone- 
field. Not a fmgle acre is now in poffeffion of the Mac- 
alafters ; and the ancient Hock of Macneils, once all power- 
ful in North, and numerous in South Knapdale, are matters 
of no more than two farms in the former, and one in the 
latter parifli, — 

Sic tranfit gloria mundi ! 

When northern ferocity had involved the weftern world 
in darknefs, and buried the arts and learning of venerable 
Rome in its ruins, it was the peculiar felicity of the firft 
planters of Chriftianity in Argylelhire to have refcued the 
facred fpark of Science from extinction, and lighted up her 
torch in the diftant ifland of Iona. Benevolence feels the 
generous glow of fatisfaction when it reflects, that, while 
the ambitious priefts of other countries were defolating 
Hates, and dethroning princes, the devout of this were dif- 
feminating, in fequeftered iflands and folitary caves, the ge- 
nuine truths of that religion, which announced peace on 
earth, and good will towards men. The purity of its doc- 
trines, we admit, were at length contaminated by fuperfti- 
tion and legendary fable ; but the gibbet has never been 
erected, nor the faggot lighted up, for the deftru&amp;ion of the 
human race. 

Monuments of primitive Chridianity are numerous in 
Argylefhire, but no where more frequent than in South 
Knapdale. Of thefe pious relicts there are four ancient

chapels, which have fuffered but little from the ruft of time , 
A fifth was removed by the Macalifters of Ceannlochcaolif- 
port, on account of its contiguity to their houfe. A fixth 
at Kilmalifaig, and a feventh at Glenakille, where there 
are burying-grounds, may pofiibly have fliared a fimilar 
fate. Of thefe, the chapels of Cove and IJlaudmore feem 
to bear marks of the greateft antiquity. 

St Columbus and St Patrick, fays tradition, having quar- 
relled about a point of faith, determined to part. The for- 
mer, difgufted with Ireland, fwore never more to fee it, 
and fet fail for Scotland. He landed on the weft coaft of 
Lochcaolifport, where he built the chapel of Cove, the 
walls of which, tilt of late years, had undergone but little 
dilapidation. Near the end of this church is a confecrated 
cave, which gives name to the farm in which it is fituated. 
Its altar and font ftill remain, and over them a crofs, cut 
on the folid rock, by no unmafterly chiffel. Tradition 
adds, that Columbus having difcovered the Irifh coaft from 
an adjoining eminence, deferted the place, and afterwards 
founded the renowned feminary of Icolumkill. 

The following anecdote of the faint, whether authentic 
or not, ferves to prove the precarious tenure of property in 
this country during the middle ages : — A book being ab- 
flra&amp;ed, which the faint particularly valued, he, in the 
overflowing of his refentment, denounced this anathema 
againft the culprit : 

" Fhir a thug nam mo leabhar, 

" Gu m boidheach a bhios do bhean ; 

" Gu ma h ard a bhios do thigh ; 

" Gu ma luath a bhios do threabhadh 

" Agus gu mo deas a bhios do bhaikr"

" and thy houfe lofty ; thy tillage eafy, and thy

Who then, in the exercife of his fober fenfes, would at- 
tempt to break the bonds of civil fociety, when, by intro- 
ducing anarchy, he mult convert the mod darling objects of 
defire into our greateft curfe ? But to return, 

Near the weft coaft of Knap lie a group of fmall iflands, 
the moft confiderable whereof is Ellanmorekilvicoharmaig. 
Carmaig was an ancient proprietor of this ifland. His 
whole family confifted of a grand-daughter, who ufed to 
amufe herfelf by angling on the ftiore, which is furrounded 
with currents, and frequented to this day by vaft crouds of 
fifh. It happened upon an occafion of this kind, that a 
bone, in place of a fifh, came out with her line ; fhe un- 
hooked, and threw it back into the fea. Again and again 
it came out in like manner. Chagrined with difappoint- 
ment, (he carried it home, and put it into the fire. The 
whitenefs of its afhes ftruck her fancy. She endeavoured 
to preferve them ; but, burning her finger in the attempt, 
inftinftively clapt it into her mouth. By this means {he 
became pregnant of the faint, whofe fupernatural gifts were 
fo long to furvive himfelf. He founded Kilvicoharmaig, 
the mother church of Knapdale ; and, after a life fpent in 
acts of piety and devotion, was buried in his native ifland. 
His tomb, a little oblong building, elevated about three 
feet above the ground, remains uninjured by time. The 
faint is faid to refent, with the moft fummary vengeance, 
the leaft indignity offered to this monument. Near his 
tomb is a fmall chapel, built by himfelf. It is arched over, 
and covered with flags. Within, in a recefs of the wall, is 
a ftone coffin, in which the priefts are faid to have been 
depofited. The figure of a naked man is cut on its cover. 

The 



316 



Statijlical Account 



The coffin, alfo, for nges back, has fervecl the faint as a 
treafury ; and this, perhaps, might be the purpofefor which 
it was originally intended. Till of late, not a flranger fet 
foot on the illand, who did not conciliate his favour, by 
dropping a fmall coin into a chink between its cover and 
fide. Upon an eminence, not far off, is a pedeftal with 
3 crofs, and the figure of a naked man ; and near to the 
crofs is a cave, polTeffing the wonderful power of caufing 
fterility in every perfon who dares to enter it. This ma- 
gic ifland, if we may believe the legendary ftory of the 
faint, poffeffed many lingular qualities. Nothing could be 
ftolen from it that did not of itfelf return. The matter of a 
Teffel, conceiving a liking to the crofs, carried it along with 
him ; but, being overtaken by a ftorm at the Mull of Can- 
tire, was obliged to throw it overboard ; it floated back to 
a creek of the ifland, called, from that circumftance, Port* 
nacroi/Jj, u e. the Harbour of the Crofs. Miracles were 
performed by the faint for many ages after his death. At 
Jength a woman, labouring under a dyfentry, addreffed him 
from the oppcfite more, in the following verfes : 

" 'S mife bean bhochd a' Braidealban 
" A m' fheafamh air lie Mhci Charmaig 
f* So naomh ann an Eilean na fairge 
" Thig's tog a bhuineach o m'earbal." 

It was an unlucky bufinefs for the invalids of thofe days. 
The faint granted her requeft but was fo fcandalifed by 
the indelicacy of her language, that he became deaf to the 
prayers of his votaries ever after. 

: The cave preferved its reputation till of late ; and, but 
for the following untoward 'accident, would have remained 
an objeft of terror till this day. A pair, more folicitous

intereft of their country, went into it, with a view to bring 
its influence to the teft of experiment. They were difap- 
pointed. The female became pregnant, and the whole 
neighbourhood fceptics. Though the miraculous excellen- 
cies of this ifland have now ceafed, they are amply com- 
penfated to the proprietor by a natural one. Not a patch 
in the Highlands is fitted to produce beef or mutton of a 
fuperior quality. 

The chapel or church of Kilmory-knap feems to have 
been the moil confiderable in South Knapdale. Its walls 
are almoft entire. A beautiful obilifk, or crofs, ftands on 
the north fide of the burying-ground. It confifts of a lin- 
gle ftone, neatly cut, and twelve feet in height : On one 
fide is reprefented a ftag-chace ; and on the other, the cru- 
cifixion of our Saviour, fufpending a balance. There is 
alfo an infcription, which the compiler of this account had 
not time to examine. It is faid to be in the Hebrew or 
Gallic character. 

Kilduflan is a fmall chapel on the ftiore of Lochgilp. It 
exhibits nothing finking ; and tradition has forgot to inroll 
it in her ample page. 

About 2 3 years ago, the tenants of Ceannlochcaolifport 
difcovered fix or feven ftone coffins in a potato-field, not 
far from the place where the chapei formerly flood. They 
were of different fizes ; but all of them too fhort to contain 
a human body. They were placed in the direction of eaft. 
and weft, and all empty, except one, in which a fmall frag- 
ment of human bone was found. Perhaps the cuftom of 
burying the dead, with the head towards the weft, was an- 
terior to the aera of Chriftianity, and borrowed by the pri- 
mitive Christians from fome pagan fuperftition. Thefe 
coffins may have been placed by the Druids, as receptacles 
for the afties of their dead The bone difcovered may have 
been rendered lefs periikible by a partial calcination. It

muft be confeffed, however, that though the draidical tem- 
ples be frequent in Argylefhire, and commonly met with 
in plains like this, yet not the leaft veftige of any is to be 
feen here. 

The following couplet has been handed down by the ge- 
nealogifts of this place : 

Colmonel, Clan A gorry, Barry, Clan Murachie, 
Mac Charmaig, Clan Neill, Martin, Clan Donachie. 

s 

It is adduced in evidence that Saints Colmonel, Barry, 
Macoharmaig, and Martin, were of the clans therein men- 
tioned. The probability is, that thefe fathers flourifhed at 
a period much anterior to our earlieft accounts of thefe 
clans ; and that, inftead of being of the fame race, they had 
been adopted as their tutilaries. The bell of St Barry's 
Chapel is ftill in prefervation at Kilberry Cattle, and has 
been long proftituted to the ignoble purpofe of fummoning 
the fervants of that family to their meals. It is infcribed 
with the faint's name, in the Latin language and Saxon 
character, but unfortunately without date. The revival of 
bell-founding, if loft in the middle ages, and the period at 
which the Saxon alphabet was introduced, might throw 
light on its antiquity. There are very many Kilmorys, 
and not a few Kilbrides, in this part of the Highlands. The 
former have likely been dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and 
the latter to a faint, whofe fame has reached far and wide, 
fince we find that there are not only farms, but parifhes, of 
this name in the low country. It may reafonably be con- 
cluded, that they are of lefs remote antiquity than fome of 
thofe already mentioned. It was not till the church be- 
came grofsly corrupted, that the Virgin was recognifed in 
an interceffory charafler ; and, as the fame of modeft merit 
rarely extends to a diiUnce, there is caufe to believe that

St Bride might cither be one of thefe miracle-making jug- 
glers, which too often difgraced religion ; or that her me- 
mory has been manufactured by fubfequent prieftcraft, to 
minuter to the occafions of its vanity or its avarice. 

The collifion of oppofite doctrines, and the cruelties in- 
flicted by the orthodox, previous to the Reformation of re- 
ligion, were unknown here. Motives of intereft, as well as 
reafon, induced our chiefs to become of the Pioteftant per- 
fuafion, and their example was readily followed by the po- 
pulace. Common fenfe was infulted by our clergy j but 
in no other relpect had they injured us. The cafe was dif- 
ferent with the reformed of other parts. They had expe- 
rienced the full force of hierarchical tyranny. Their 
wounds were ftill bleeding, and they were hurried by re- 
fentment into excefies, hardly inferior to the abufcs they 
affected to correct. It is to our honour that the fame doc- 
trinal unanimity continues ftill to prevail among us. Of 
the fix parifhes which constitutes the prefbytery of Inve- 
rary, there is hardly a fingle diffenting native, either of the 
Romifh or Seceding church ; and the fum total of ftranger 
Catholics in South Knapdale, amounts to no more than one 
old woman from Perthlhire. 



Extent, &amp;c. — This parifti is in length, from fouth to 
north, about 20 computed miles, and 16 in breadth. It is 
fituated in the county and fynod of Argyle, and prefbytery 
of lnverary. The foil is chiefly of a moffy nature, incum- 
bent on a ftratum of fand ; but in the lower grounds it is 
a good loam. Very little of the parilh, however, is arable ; 
and that which is ploughed or dug with the ipade, produ- 
ces in general fo very light'crops, that it is reckoned more 
profitable to throw it into fheep-walks, or pafiure-land for 
cattle. The grains chiefly fown are oats and bear. Every

where potatoes are cultivated with great care, and of late 
they conftitute the principal food of the inhabitants. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The country being mountainous 
and adjacent to the weftern ocean, heavy rains are fre- 
quent in fpring, fummer, and autumn. The winter is ex- 
tremely ftormy ; fnow is fometimes very deep, and froft is 
generally of fhort duration. The inhabitants are common- 
ly very healthy, and many of them live to a confiderable 
old age. The moll prevalent difeafes are the fmall-pox, 
fevers, and colds. 

Risers. — There are feveral rivers in the parim, all of 
which abound with trout of an excellent flavour. In dry 
•weather all the rivers are fordable ; but, owing to the heavy 
rains that fall on the mountains, they often life very fud- 
denly to a great height, which renders them wholly un- 
payable. 

Roads.— The roads are extremely bad, efpecially in win- 
ter. The beft is a part of the great road on the eaft fide of 
the parilh, which leads from Inverary to Campbelton. It 
was made by the fpirited exertions of the Duke of Argyle, 
affifted by the gentlemen of the county. In fome places 
it is formed on the fea-lhore, through a ridge of ruggid rocks, 
34 feet at leafl perpendicular above the fea. 

Mines and Mineral Springs.-!* that part of the parim 
that belongs to Sir James Campbell of Inverneil, there is a 
lead mine that had been wrought feveral years ago. In 
the neighbourhood of the mine a few mineral fprings 
make their appearance ; but no experiments on the virtue 
of their waters has yet been made.

Moufitains.-*Oi thefe there is no fcarcity. The moft 
remarkable are Cruach Lufacb, i. e. the hill of plants or 
herbage, from the great number of herbs growing on it ; 
and Sliabb Gam'/, (a mountain feparated at both ends). It 
is twelve miltjs long, and eight broad at the bafe ; it be- 
longs to the Duke of Argyle. 

Woods and CVwo.^— Some parts of the parifli abound with 
natural woods, or coppices of oak, afh, birch, and hazel. 
Several of them are well inclofed with proper fences.-— 
Although there are not a few caves in the parilh, yet none 
are of confequence but one, near which is a chapel, with an 
altar and font. The farm in which it is lituated is called 
the Cove,. 

Ecclejiajlical State.— ^ This parifh contains three places 
-of worfhip. One is at Tarbert, thirteen computed miles 
from the church at which the minifter relides. In this 
chapel it was the cuftom, till of late, for the minifter to 
preach every fixth Sabbath : Now a miffionary is eftablifh- 
cd there by the Society for Propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge. There is another chapel about five miles from the 
church. The prefent incumbent, Mr Daniel Hyndman, 
was admitted to the charge in 1771. His predecefioi-s 
were, Mr Patrick Pollock, firft minifter of this parifh, after 
the disjunction from North Knapdale ; and Mr Hugh 
Campbell, now minifter of Kilmartin. The King is pa- 
tron. 

The prefent incumbent, when he came to the parifh, 
found neither a church, or proper place of worfhip, in the 
whole bounds. There was not a glebe nor manfe. The 
itipend was only L. 47, with L. i 16 s. for communion- 
elements. In the year 1772, he was under the neceffity of 
Cuing the heritors at law before he could prevail upon them 

Vol. XIX. • S f to

to build a kirk. He was forced, for the frjace of fix years, 
to preach in the fields. In the year 1772, he entered a 
procefs of augmentation againft them; and in 1775, ob- 
tained a decreet of modification for fixing the ftipend at 
four chalders of visual, one half oat-meal, the other half 
bear, with L. 600 Scots, and" L. 40 Scots for communion- 
elements ; a fum by far too fmall for defraying the expen- 
ces of the communion in fo populous a parifh. As there 
is no man fe, the heritors allow L. 10 Sterling per annum 
until one is built. 

Heritors, tec. — There are eleven proprietors in the pa- 
rifl), of whom two only are reiident. There are four te- 
nants who occupy extenfivc farms. One of them pays of 
rent yearly L. 256, another L. 105, a third L. 103 ; all ex- 
plufive of public burdens. There is a considerable number 
of fmaller tenants. 

Poor. — -The number of poor on the pariih-roll is 15. 
They are fupported by the intereft of L. 20, which was 
mortified by the late Campbell of Stonefield. To this 
very fniall fum is added the collections at the church, which 
are extremely inconfiderable.

Language. — The Gaelic is the prevailing language fpo- 
ken in the parifh. The Englifh has of late fpread consider- 
ably, owing, in a great meafure, to young people travelling 
to the low country, and returning home after they acqui- 
red the language. 

Chara&amp;er of the People. — The inhabitants are in general 
aftive, induftrious, and humane. They are extremely fel- 
dom guilty of any kind of immorality, that can expofe 
them to puniftiment by law. 

Ft/heries. — The herring-fifhing occupies a considerable 
number of people. The fifh annually frequent an arm of 
the fea on the weft of the parim. It is called Loch-caolzf- 
port, which Signifies a fmall loch, with a harbour. • The 
herrings alfo frequent Loch- fine, which bounds the parilh 
on the north-eaft The value of thefe fifhings will, it is

believed, be increafed by the Crinan Canal, a confutable 
part of which runs through the parifh. 

^advantages.— The people here labour under many 
difadvantages, which are great obftacles to their prefent 
happinefs and improvement. The want of proper fchools 
for the education of- youth is none of the Ieaft. There is 
not a parochial fchool • and thofe eftablilhed by the So- 
ciety cannot accommodate all the children, many of whom, 
owing to local filiations, have it not in their power to at- 
tend them — The diftance from market towns, and the bad 
ftate of the roads, are complained of as very great hardmips. 
—The fcarcity of good fuel is feverely felt by all the in- 
habitants ; peat and turf are univerfally ufed ; but when 
the feafon for calling them is wet, which is not unfrequently 
the cafe, the poor people fufFer beyond defcription ; and 
even although the feafon is favourable, fo much of their 
time is neceflarily fpent in preparing the peats, that many 
things of importance in agriculture, &amp;c. muft be omitted.

<p>Situation. 

IN Stormont, a beautiful and fertile fubdivifion of Perth- 
fhire, is pleafantly fituated the pariih of Kinclaven. 
It is under the ecclefiaftical jurifdiction of the prefbyterv of 
Dunkeld, and fynod of Perth and Stirling. The bounda- 
ries are, Cargill on the eaft ; Caputh on the north; and 
AuchtergaverT on the weft and fouth. 

Climate and Soil. — The climate is not greatly expofed to 
the fudden and frequent viciffitudes of heat and cold^ rain 
and drought, which feldom fail to affect, in no fmall degree, 
the agricultural operations, in diftri&amp;s adjacent to the weftern 
coafts of Scotland, or in the immediate vicinity of the high 

mountains

mountains and extenfive ridges of hills in Pcrthfhire. 
C Aing in a great meafure to the mildnefs of the climate, 
and partly perhaps to other caufes, this place is believed not 
to be piodu&amp;ive of, or to fofter, any epidemical diltemper 
amonglt the inhabitants, who are generally ftrong and 
healthy — The foil is moftly light and Iharp, containing 
greKt numbers of water-worn ftones, many of which are, in 
fome places, fo large, as to obltruft the operations of the 
plough. The moorlands, and higher parts of thepu.iih, 
contain in their foils a fmall proportion of mofl'y earth. A 
rich black, loam conftitutes the foil of fome of the grounds 
in the neighbourhood of Arntully. The furface is diver- 
fined with a few niing grounds, all of which are accefiible 
to the plough, and are not elevated to a great height above 
the level of the fea. From fome of them, however, the 
profpedts are diverfified, and very pleafant. 

Agriculture. — Agriculture is here carried on, in feveral 
places, with confiderable knowledge and exertion. A ro- 
tation of crops, fuitable to the foil and climate, is adhered 
to by moft farmers. Farms in general are fmall, being 
from about 20 to 50 acres arable. One of the moft exten- 
five arable farms is Innernytie ; it is rented at about L. 125 
Sterling per annum. Some places are parcelled out into 
fmall paffles, or farms, few of which are above 30 acres 
each. The occupiers of moft of them are under the necef- 
fity of following fome other occupation than that of farm- 
ing. A confiderable number are weavers ; each of whom 
has a loom or two in the corner of the houfe, which is ge- 
nerally low and ill conftrufted. They employ themfeives 
at the weaving bufinefs, chiefly during winter. Their uten- 
fils are far from being always in the beft order, or made 
after the moft approved model. They are, however, good 
enough, for the fabric of the cloth woven, which is moftly 

coarfe

coarfe linens for the Perth market. Several looms are em- 
ployed by manufadurers in Perth, who furnith the yarn, 
and pay a certain price for the yard weaving. Some of 
thefe fmall farmers or pafflers are at times employed with 
their horfes and carts at the roads, &amp;c. By this frugal \ 
fyftem, many numerous families are trained up in habits of 
induftry and economy, though not with that elegance and 
luxury, which, of late, have become the chara&amp;eriftie marks, 
of the ftiie of living, adopted by extenfive farmers. 

Thefe tradefmen, or farmers, or by whatever name they 
may be called, are their own matters, and, of confequence, 
poiTefs an independent fpirit, which is very feldom to be 
found amongft the menial hinds and other fervants of great 
farmers. They pay a rent for their land greater in propor- 
tion, perhaps, than could be got by the landlord, were their 
fmall pofleffions thrown into large farms; and many of 
them are improving their lands with confiderable Ikill and 
activity. — More than the half of the parifli, however, is 
not inclofed, a circumftance not much to the credit or pro- 
fit either of the proprietors or tenants. Many acres of 
moor or wade land yet remain to be improved. Thefe 
neglecled fpots abound at prefent with heath, whins, bent, 
broom, &amp;.c. that afford but a coarfe and fcanty pafture for 
cattle. The foil, in moft parts of the parifh, feems to be 
naturally well adapted for the growth of broom ; in fome 
places that plant rifes to the height of feven or eight feet, 
and makes a kind of flicker as well as fence to corn-fields. 
Arntully moor is the moft extenfive piece of wafte land in 
the parifli. It is chiefly occupied as a common for paftu- 
ring cattle belonging to the neighbouring farmers. A great 
part of the common of Arntully was about 20 years ago 
fubdivided, (glebed, according to the provincial language), 
and convenient farm-houfes and offices built on the fubdi- 
yifions. The foil, in general, will admit of confiderable im-

provement. It is obfervable here, equally as in many 
cxhcrr places of Scotland, that when the moors are pared or 
cut for turf, they naturally produce abundant crops of 
guild, ( cbryfanthemum fegetum), and a few other plants, 
which are not, until the fward is cut away, found growing 
in the place. This is efpecially the cafe in thefe moors 
£hat had anciently been in tillage. It is believed that the 
feeds of the guild will, when buried in the ground, retain 
their vegetative power for a great length of time, but 
when expoied ro the influence of the weather, will readily 
vegetate. This is certainly true, not only with refpeft to 
the feeds of this, but of many other plants. Too much care, 
therefore, cannot be taken to cut down thefe weeds which 
are hurtful to agriculture before the feeds arrive to matu- 
rity. It is grofsly abfurd in farmers to allow thiftlcs, &amp;c. 
to grow without moleftation on way-fides, or other uncul- 
tivated places. The feeds are moftly carried into the ad- 
jacent fields, and occafion much trouble. Many of them 
perifh, but millions are buried in the earth by the plough, 
and afterwards vegetate with great luxuriancy when raifed 
up, even at the diftance of many years, to the influence of 
heat, light, and rain. Farmers in this, and all the neigh- 
bouring parifhes, are reprehenfible for not checking more 
than they do, the progrefs of thefe plants, which, whatever 
their medicinal virtues may be, are very hurtful to agri- 
culture.— -Although much of the foil in Kinclaven is fit for 
the turnip hufbandry, yet a very fmall portion of it is laid 
out for the cultivation of that ufeful root. The grains com- 
monly cultivated are oats, barley, wheat, beans, and peafe. 
The produce is generally good ; barley frequently yields 
eight returns, that commonly gives meal for grain. In 
fome places the old, but abfurd cuftam of fowing peafe, to- 
gether with oats, in the fame field, is, by fome flovenly far- 
mers, ftill continued. It generally happens that the one 

grain 



x 



of Kinclaven. 



grain is ripe fooner than the other. In defence of this 
cuftom it is alleged, that if, owing to the weather, one of 
■the kinds fail, the pther will be tolerably good. Every ex- 
perienced farmer will confider this argument as extremely 
inconclulive. 

Population,— The number of inhabitants in the year 
1755, by Dr Webfter's account, was 993. At preftnt, it 
is about 1 150. 

Church, School.— The parifli kirk is in good repair; the 
manfe not. Drummond of Logie-Almond is patron. The 
Rev. Mr John Scott is the prefent incumbent. The fti- 
pend is 1000 merks with 4 chalders of victual. — A meet- 
ing houfe, belonging to the Antiburgher clafs of Seceders, 
was erected about a mile eaft of Arntully, in the year 1744, 
and is frequented by a numerous congregation from this 
and the neighbouring pariCh.es, who prove themfelves, by 
their laudable behaviour, to .be good members of Society. — 
There are two fchools in the parifli, both of which are well 
frequented. The falary annexed to the parochial fchool is 
L. 80 Scotch. 

Villages.^-The. chief in the parifh is Arntully, commonly 
pronounced as if written Arntilly. It is fituated a few 
miles weft of the church, and confuts of about 60 or 70 
dwelling-houfes, Scattered in every direction, and exhibit- 
ing a ftriking picture of ancient villages in mod parts of 
the kingdom. The roads and paffages amongft the houfes 
are inconceivably bad, especially in wet weather. What 
adds confiderably to their miferable ftate, is the abominable, 
but too general practice, of placing the dunghill (midden- 
hole, vulgarly ) before the doors of the dwelling-houfes, many 
of which, in every point of view, much accords with the

filiation in which they are placed. The county of Perth 
were it poffeffed of no other fpot of a War defection] 
ihould allow Arntully to remain in its prefent ftate, that a 
proper contrail might be drawn, between a neat modern 
village, and one upon the old conftru&amp;ion. Moft of the 
inhabitants, many of whom are weavers, occupy a final! 
bit of ground adjoining to their houfes, which furmflies 
them with garden Huffs, &amp;c. by which many of thern are 
enabled to keep milch-cows. This they very juftly confi- 
der as a great help to their families. They feem to be 
contented with their domeflic condition. Befides Arntully, 
the parifli contains a few very fmall villages, as Knock- 
fhinan, &amp;x. 

W oods. — This diftrict is ornamented with feveral cop- 
pices, or natural woods, chiefly of oak, birch, and hazel. 
They are cut every nineteen or twenty years, for the fake 
of the bark, which at Perth brings a good price. There 
are fome plantations of pines and foreft-trees, generally in a 
thriving ftate. 

Rivers, Fijhings. — The Toy is the only river here that 
merits notice. It runs in winding directions for the fpace 
of feveral miles on the north and eaft ; no where, in its 
whole courfe, has it made fuch ravages on the land as in 
this parilh, chiefly on the eftate of Mr Drummond of Logic 
Almond. It has at feveral times forced its way through 
the banks, and made great excavations in the corn-fields, 
where it has formed fpacious tradls for itfelf. Three or 
four of thefe tra£ls, being now abandoned by the river, re- 
main lafting monuments what the Tay in its fury can do. 
It is probable, that at no great length of time it will make 
flill more extenfive devaftations on the richeft and mod 
beautiful part of the parifli. — The fifhings on the river are 



of Kinclaven. 33;3 

of fome importance. One at the Linn of Campfie, on a 
very fmall extent of the water, brings L. 80 per annum to 
Lord Dunmore the proprietor. The fall of water is not 
high, but the Linn is very deep, and contains great quanti- 
ties of excellent falmon. On the Tay, about a mile from 
the kirk, is Kinclaven ferry, which occupies three ferry 
boats, one for foot-paffengers, one for horfes, and another 
for carriages. At the ferry, is a good and commodious inn, 
on the Kinclaven fide of the river. 

Mills.— -The parifli is furnifhed with feveral corn-mills, 
to which the land in general is thirled or aftriaed. The 
thirlage in fome places is confiderably high. This kind of 
fervitude is here, as well as almoft every where elfe in 
Scotland, confidered as a great hardfhip, and an obftacle to 
agricultural improvements: Thefe thirlages or multures, 
at the firft ereftion of corn-mills, might have been very 
juft and neceffary. Now they are quite the reverfe. Why, 
therefore, lhould an improved fociety fuffer an univerfally 
acknowledged grievance any longer to exift, and impede 
the moft beneficial improvements of the country? 



Cajlle.— Kinclaven Caftle, on the banks of the Tay, re- 
mains in ruin3. The walls are about eight or ten feet 
high ; and unlefs deftroyed by fome modern Goth, will con- 
tinue, for ages, to exhibit, an example of the ancient ftrong- 
holsd in Scotland.

<p>Situation. 

r | ''HIS parifli lies near the eaftern boundary of Perth- 
Ihire. The church Hands in N. lat. 56 0 33'. and 
long. 5 min. of a degree W. from Edinburgh ; being a 
mile and an half N. from Cupar Angus ; 6 miles W. from 
Meigle ; 14 miles N. E. from Perth ; and 17 miles N. W. 
from Dundee. It is fituated on part of the loweft grounds 
of Strathmore, (Great Strath), being that extenfive flat 
which runs almoft in a ftraight line from the fea at Mon- 
trofe, by Forfar, Cupar Angus, Perth, and Stirling, to 
Dunbarton, and the mouth of the frith of Clyde, in a di- 
rection nearly N. E. and S.W. ; and is bounded by the

Grampian mountains * on the N. W.; and by the Sidlawf- 
and Ochil Hills on the S. E. 5 the breadth of the ftrath be- 
tween being generally from 6 to 8 miles. 

River IJla.— The church ftands 200 yards N. from the 
right bank of the river Ma, part of the water of which 
rifes in the loch of Forfar, where is the higheft ground o£ 
the flat between this and Montrofe, (about 200 feet above 
the fea). The courfe of the water from the loch of For- 
far is through Dean, Ifla, and part of Tay, in a line from 
N. E. to S. W. along the middle of Strathmore. The Tay, 
after a gradual winding to the left by Perth, runs by the 
Carfe of Gowrie and Dundee to the German Ocean, in a 
direction nearly parallel to the above portion of the tract 
of the Ifla inverted. The Ifla itfelf rifes in the Gram- 
pian mountains, and runs generally S. E. with a rapid cur- 
rent till it is joined by the Dean, after which it runs S. W. 
(paft the fouth fide of this parifh) into the Tay. At the 
church of Bendothy the Ifla is 75 yards broad, and a yard 
deep at the ford. It is no where deeper than 9 or 10 feet 
in fummer ; and its banks are nearly the fame height abov e 
its ordinary furface. At high floods, it rifes 13 or 14 feet 
above its fummer level \ this is in part owing to the Tay, 
below this, being contracted for four miles by high and 
narrow banks. The Ifla here is 100 or 110 feet above the 

level of the fea. It runs with an infenfible fall.

^f&amp;°f i or Ericht.-Th\s river falls into the right 
ftfe of the Ifla In this parifli. It alfo iffaes from the Grl- 
plans. It is compofed of the united ftreams of Shoe and 
Ardle, which laft feems to be a contraction of Erochdale. 
The Shee, called alfo Blackwater, falls into the left fide of 
the Ardle. Thefe rivers generally run S.E. all of them 
with a rapid current. 

Bivifiom of the Parijh.— The river Eroch divides that 
part of the parifli which is in continuation, nearly into two 
equal parts. One of thefe parts, lying W. of Eroch and 
N. of Ifla, is embraced on other fides by the parifli of Blair- 
gowrie ; and the other of thefe parts, lying E. from Eroch, 
and N. from Ifla, is embraced, on other fides, by the parifli 
of Alyth on the E. and by the parifli of Rattray partly on 
the W. The parifli of Cupar Angus bounds the whole, 
along the Ifla, on the S. That part of the parifli which is 
in continuation, is 6 miles long, and a mile and an half 
acrofs. The church ftands in the middle of the weftera 
divifion. Befides this, there are two other parts of the pa- 
rifli, infulated entirely by other parifhes, and feparated 
from one another. One of thefe parts, compofed of Perfy*, 
on the Shee, and Cally on the Ardle, lies in the angle of 
confluence between the Shee and Ardle, the neareft part 
being 7 miles from the parifli church. The other infulated 
part, Drimmie, lies on the left bank of the Eroch, being a 
mile from the former part, and feven miles from the 
church. Thefe two parts, taken together, are about a 
fourth of the whole parifli. 

Name. — The name of the parifli, in the prefbytery 
books, during the laft century, is written Bennethy or 
Benathy ; the firft of which exprefles the pronounciation at 
the place, and alfo the etymology (Nether-hill) ; on the

fouth declivity of which hill the church ftands. It has 
been fome time written Bendochy, being a corruption of 
the form of writing, which occurs in the prefbytery book, 
the e having been therein written backwards, the end of 
fecond « turned above the line, and the t written very 
fhort. The name infer ibed on the communion cups and 
plates is Bendothy, A. D. 1786. 

Wejlern Divifion. — That part of the parifti which is in 
continuation is almoft all under cultivation. That part in 
which the church ftands, W. of the confluence of Eroch and 
Ifla, is generally eafy level ground. It confifts chiefly of a 
gentle ridge, riling with an almoft infenfible afcent from 
the river Eroch, and running from thence fouth-weftward, 
parallel to the Ifla, having its higheft fummit at Muirhead, 
oppofite the church, from whence it declines again to the 
weftward. The fides of this ridge decline gradually to- 
wards the Ifla upon one fide, and to the Monkmire on the 
other, which feparates it from the parilh of Blairgowrie. 
Its higheft fummit is 80 or 90 feet above the level of the 
Ifla. It is compofed entirely of that red clay fubftance, 
called mortar here, from its ufe as a cement in building. 
Between the above ridge and the Ifla, there is another in- 
ferior ridge, which runs a fmall way parallel to the greater 
one; on the S. fide of which (former) the church ftands. 
The inferior rifes about 60 feet above the Ifla. It is compo- 
fed entirely of gravel, or water-driven ftones and fand. It is 
broken off a fmall way, and then, in the fame parallel line 
to the fouth-weftward, an infulated ridge of the fame ma- 
terials occurs at Couty, which the water of Ifla fometimes 
nearly forms into an ifland. There is befides a good deal 
of perfectly level ground, efpecially near the banks of the 
rivers. This divifion of the parifli weftward ot the Eroch 
is poflefled by three proprietors.

Statiftical Account 



Coupargrange, on the E. is held by the heirs of the late 
Vr Youn s , Profeffor of Midwifery in Edinburgh. R cn  
paid by the tenants is L. 651 Sterling ; and valued rent 
L. 141 1 Scotch. 

Couty and Bendothy, on the W. held by the Honour, 
able James Stewart Mackenzie, Lord Privy Seal. Kent 
paid by the tenants lately, L. 35 8 Sterling; and valued 
rent, L. 958 Scotch. 

Mudhall, in the middle, worth L. 71 Sterling annually ; 
valued rent, L. 125 Scotch. 

Thefe eftates contain about 1500 acres, rented, or 
worth annually, L. 108c Sterling, befides 100 acres of 
fir planting ; they are divided and fubdivided by thorn- 
hedges ; but there are few fencible inclofures. There is a 
great variety of foil. The foil of the beft lands of Couper- 
grange, efpecially the level ground near the confluence of 
the rivers, but now 40 feet at leaft above their floods, is 
compofed of a deep black earth. This black earth, com- 
pofed in a great meafure of the rottings of vegetables, is 
more generally incumbent on fand than on mortar. In the 
grounds of Coupargrange it is above clay ; but there is a 
ftratum of fand between, which drains off the water. The 
lands of Mudhall are compofed of three feet black earth at 
top, and then pure white fand for more than 40 feet down, 
as may be feen at the place where Ifla has puflied in its 
moulder and undermined. There is a black foil fimilar to 
this on fome parts of the Lord Privy Seal's eftate, but it is 
generally on lower ground there, and within flood-mark of 
the Ifla. It is on fuch ground that the feed-oats grow, 
which have got a name through all the country. They 
are called the Coupargrange Oats. They are the common 
oats of the neighbourhood -, but rife cleaner, whiter, and 
more fubftantial, from deep cherilhing foil. 

Where 



cf Bendothy. 339 

Where the mortar * is up permoft, as in feveral places of 
thefe grounds, efpecially fuch as are high-eft, it proves a wet 
poor foil. In fome places, which had formerly been moor, 
there is a thin black fuirface above the mortar, which has 
been produced by rotten fog and mofs ; this proves a very 
wet backward foil. From fin all experiments it appears, 
that fuch foil would be greatly improved by trenching. 
Earth that has once been trenched, will never again acquire 
the impenetrability and folidity which it had retained from 
its firft formation befides, in fuch foil, there is no good 
ground to lofe from the tap, by trenching. The rock be- 
low mortar, which is alfo of a red fubftance, when dug 
from the bottom of wells, moulders in the air, and feems to 
be rock marl. Ground that has a bottom of gravel and 
fand has commonly a very thin foil above. This is the 
only fort of foil that baffles induftry. The Ifla floods be- 
tween 2*00 and 300 acres of thefe eftates. At high flood's 
it covers the breadth of half a mile from one fide of the 
river to the other. Water-made ground is generally dry 
and fertile ; more fo than moll of the other grounds that are 
above the flood-mark of the river. There is no vegetable 
mould under the latter, in general ; the former is in a great 
meafure compofed of vetegable mould ; this is fome eom- 
penfation to the farmer for extraordinary trouble and great 
rilks in harvett, when the watery element threatens to pof- 
fefs his property, Some farmers drag their corns to- higher 
grounds when cut others truft to the feafon, and fome- 

times 

* That red coarfe clay, called mortar, is the bafis of all the grounds 
in this part of Strathmore. Upon digging to a proper depth, it will always 
be found at the bottom, either, in the form of clay or rock. Sand, gravel, 
pure clay, black earth, are always incumbent on it, never otherwile. Gra- 
vel is found on ground near to rivers, (and on flat ground, which, though 
remote from them, is not many dozen of feet above their level), rather 
than elfewhere.

times efcape, but at other times the overflowing ffootj 
fweeps all before it. Two neighbours had taken thefe op- 
pofite methods: One jeered the other for want of faith in 
Providence ; in a few days the rain defcended and the flood 
came, and the provident farmer retorted, Where is your 
faith now, neighbour? It is down the water with your 
corn. In fome inftances, the proprietors of thefe eflates 
have given very liberal benefaftions to their tenants, for 
damage done by the river in harveft ; particularly in har- 
veft 1774, when the river rofe two feet higher than ever 
was known. It was within fix inches of the top of the 
loweft arches of the bridge at Couty. It left the bottom 
of the furrows bare where wheat had been newly fown 
that feafon ; and that place was nine years of recovering its 
foil and vegetable powers. There is a lake of marl on the 
N. W. boundary of thefe eftates, called the Monkmire, 
which is for the prefent exhaufted. The Stormont loch, 
at the W. corner of Lord Privy Seal's eftate, contains marl ; 
this loch is not yet drained. There is an ifland in it, which 
has probably been a place of ftores. The diftri£l called Stor- 
mont lies between that place and Dunkeld. 

Eajiern Divi/ion. — That part of the parilh (in continua-

the N. and N. W. terminating in a riling ground, which 
forms part of a front ridge of the Grampians. The higheft

The eftates of Grange of Aberbothry are all level, ma- 
nageable ground, with a gentle afcent north-eaftward. They 
are all open and uninclofed. Not above 30 years ago the 
houfes were all cluftered in a village, and the eftates were 
in runrig. Moft of the lands of Grange are of clay, of d. 
whitifh nature in the bottom ; but much of it is changed 
above into a darker vegetable mould, alfo famous for pro- 
ducing feed-oats. Some of the grounds, efpecially in the 
haughs, are fandy. The whole haughs here retain the

parts which have the fteepeft afcent have redeft earth, and moft 
of the colour of the bottom. Here and there, efpecially, in 
the fteepeft afcent, appears a red rock, mixed with fmall 
rounded pebles. There are many detached, rounded, whin 
or moor-ftones in thefe grounds, blue and hard, a fort of 
porphyry, from one foot to three or four feet diameter, 
which have no mother rock here. The farms on the eftate' 
Of Blacklaw, are divided from one another by thorn hedges ; 
and there are fome ftone-dike inclofures on Muirtown and 
St Fink. There are not above 100 acres of this di virion 
uncultivated. On thefe grounds, and neighbourhood, efpe- 
cially at St Fink and Chapeltown and Little Drum, there 
are many of thefe lingular ridges of nature, called here 
Drums *(dorfum); perhaps 10 or 12 of them within a 

fmall 

* There are many of thefe drums in the neighbourhood, in the parimes of 
Alyth and Rattray, and in the Stormont, which have the fame parallelifm 
and pofition with the above. The Garrydnims in the Stormont, which are 
delineated by their dales and rills in Stobie's map, are among the moft re- 
markable, being a mile and an half long each, about 100 feet high, and 
600 feet broad at bafe,, and rifing above one another, according to the na- 
tural 



of Bendothy.

fmall fpace of each other. They have all a parallelifm t» 
one another, and decline eaftward. The rills between them 

run 

tural afcent of the ground in the neighbourhood. Indeed, drums occur 
over all this part of Strathmore. On the S. fide of the Ifla, their length is 
N. E. and S.W. parallel to Strathmore. It is evident, that they have not 
been produced by rills, fince their length is not parallel to the line of de- 
fcent of the mountain, on the fide of which they ftand, but generally per- 
pendicular to it : Befides, frequently, though not always, the water runs 
from the dale at both ends. And in level ground, in many cafes, the 
drum raifes its back high above all grounds adjacent. Whatever caufe 
may have produced the mountains therafelves, and the great vale of Strath- 
more between them, thefe drums in Strathmore appear plainly to have been 
produced by the tides of the ocean, of which Strathmore was then a chan- 
nel, and to have been formed (like banks in channels of the fea) by the tide- 
of flood, coming by Forfar from the E. end of Strathmore, and fearching 
partly weftward along the ftrath, and partly fearching diagonally up among 
the Grampians; and again by the tide of ebb returning the fame way by 
which the tide of flood went up. Agreeably to this, not only the rills and 
burns, or brooks, are all parallel to the drums, but the rivers Tay, Eroch, 
and Ifla, as they come out from the Grampians into the ftrath, all point 
eaftward, and even their bendings among the mountains are towards the E. ; 
notwithftanding, that afterwards, in the middle of Strathmore, they run in 
one body fouth-weftward : In coming out from the mountains, the rivers 
run in the direction of the tide of ebb, and after becoming confiderable 
bodies in the middle {of the Strath, they run in the direction of the tide of 
flood ; circumftances which can be eafily apprehended. That the drums 
and courfes of brooks and river? have been formed in this manner, is an, 
•pinion which I have weighed maturely, which has prefled upon my mind 
for feveral years, and which I have feen a good many parts of Scotland t\- 
afcertain the truth of ; which, being an hilly country, full of ftraths, is 
better for determining a point of this nature, than a champain country, like 
mod of England. It is an opinion which I have put to. the left of experi- 
ment, by judging before hand, as the higher grounds of a province opened 
to view what muft be the pofition of the drums between ; • and where the 
premises were right, there was no error in the conclufion. To enlarge 
upon this point would be foreign to the fubje&amp; of § this paper. Suffice it to 
fay, that drums are parallel to the ftraths in which they lie. And whcie 
there are no ftraths, they are parallel to the bafe of the adjacent mountains. 
The drums and riven arc commonly parallel to ea$h other. In this cafe.

which is flatteft ; thofe parts which are fteepeft have them 
more rarely. In the grounds of Polcallc there is a dale

the rivers are flreight. It is always a crooked river that runs acrofs the 
drums ; fometimes following the dale, and foraetimes breaking over the 
drum. And fuffice it farther to obferve, that the centre of gravity of the 
earth, depends on the relative pofition of the materials thereof ; fo that if 
the water enveloping the north pole, were, by fome means, tj anfported t» 
the fouth pole, a new center of gravity would be thereby , formed ; and the 
waters would never return to their old bed, but would adhere to the new 
center. 

I would farther add upon this head, a paffage from Dr Edmund Halley's 
Aftronomyof Comets: — " Hitherto no comet has threatened the earth with 
" a nearer approach than that of 1680, (whole period is 575 years). For 
" by calculation I find, that November nth, ib 6', that comet was not 
" above the femidiameter of the fun to the northward of the way of the 
" earth ; at which time, had the earth been there, the comet would have 
* had a parallax equal to that of the moon ; this is fpoken to altronomers. 
" But what might be the confequence of fo near an appulfe, or of a con- 
" tact, or laftly, of a fliock of the celeftial bodies, (which is by no means 
" impofhble to come to pafs), I leave to be difcufled by the ftudious of 
« phyfical matters" Another return of this comet may clear up itshiftory, 
and that of the changes of the earth. Its 8th bygone vifitation of the earth,

Perfy and Cally, uncultivated, and level at top, being a 
continuation of the hilly ground adjacent, and having nearly 
the fame elevation with other high grounds . in the neigh- 
bourhood. Thefe high grounds feem to have been the 
original furface of the country ; the above cultivated parts 
among the Grampians having been fcooped out by bodies 
of water running in thefe beds. Perfy, Cally, and Drim- 
mie, belonged of old to the monks of Cupar Angus : Cal- 
ly, for this reafon, was named Monk's Cally. The infu-

N. fide of which ridge there is a hollow, and then again a

Runrig formerly.— -There is properly no village in the 
parifh. About 40 years ago, the farm houfes lay together 
in clutters, from the ancient policy of felf-dcfence againft 
depredators, and from the conveniency of keeping the 
cattle on common pafture. The farms lay in runrig, that 
js, each field was divided into as many parts or ridges as 
there were farmers in the village ; by which the good and 
bad land was equally divided among all ; and in winter, or 
when in grafs, all the ground was common pafturage. Dif- 
ferent properties were thus occupied, as well as different 
farms on the fame property. A multiplicity of interfering 
interefts difcouraged any attempt at a change. There was 
not then, nor indeed could there be, any winter turnip, 
fown grafs, or wheat ; neither was there any fallow nor 
potatoes. Lord Privy Seal, whofe property lay by itfelf, 
was the firft that divided and inclofed his farms feparately. 
He was next followed by the owners of Cupar-grange, 
originally diftributed among twelve poffeffors ; but eleven 
parts of the twelve were now become one property. After 
which, the Grange of Aberbothry was divided ; originally 
the equal property of eight, now of fix perfons unequally. 
There were formerly balks between the ridges 5 there was 
no grafs private property but what grew on the balks. 
There are now no balks. Formerly they ploughed with 
eight oxen, or with four oxen and two horfes before them j 
at prefent they plough entirely with horfes, commonly 
two in a plough. What corn they had was not much in- 
ferior to what grows at prefent. They ploughed always 
deep, cleaned the ground in the fpring, and dunged it 
for barley. The whole of the dung was laid on the infield. 
The outfield, which was the greater proportion, never got 
any dung. It yielded a crop now and then, after lying 
feveral years in grafs, or rather in a ftate of nature ; the 
crop was private property, but the grafs was common paf-

turage. Formerly they ufed tumbler fledges for carts ; 
the wheels and axle being all of one piece ; they now ufe 
carts of a proper conftruftion. Almoft all this parifh was 
abbey lands. At the Reformation, the monks fold the lands, 
and the tenants who refided generally became the purchafers. 
The circumftance of their purchafe made little alteration 
on their manner of living. Anciently there was no glafs 
in the windows, but only wooden boards; now every 
window has fome glafs. There are fix gentlemen's houfes, 
and five farm-houfes two {lories high. The inhabitants 
formerly had, and fome ftill have, vile fmoaky houfes for 
want of vents. This has begun to be remedied in fome 
low thatched houfes, by building a three feet wide chimney 
of mafon- work, fix feet high, and fetting a clay and ftake 
vent above it to go out at the top, three feet wide within 
every way ; narrow vents of mafon- work being found to be 
dangerous in thatched houfes. 

'Jacks. — In the low country part of the parifli, the tenants 
have all tacks of 19, or a fmaller number of years ; and 
their rent is paid commonly after the crop is fold and dif- 
pofed of. In the Highland diftri&amp;s they fcarcely have any 
tacks, and as the tenant may go when he pleafes, the rent 
is paid commonly before the crop is off the ground, ac- 
cording to the practice of the neighbouring Highlands. For 
fome time bygone, the tacks of Lord Privy Seal's tenants 
have been renewed two years before their expiration. A 
reafonable rent is fixed on by the heritor, in which the te- 
nant finds it his intereft to concur. The confequence is, they 
are all old tenants on this eflate. One family has feen out 
the century in the fame place. In the eftates of fome 
other proprietors of the parilli, fome farms have been let 
(by nevvfpaper advertifements for private offers) to the 
highefl: bidders ; this makes landed property an.objecl only

of commerce, which is not fo favourable for the folidity of 
fociety, as that mode (refulting from the principles of the 
feudal fyftem) by which the tenant, born at the fame cradle, 
and living on the fame foil, willies to lie in the fame grave 
with his fathers. Whereas a tenant, who has been pre- 
fered becaufe he was the higheft bidder, thinks he owes duty 
to no man afrer he has paid his rent. There is one family 
on the Cupar-grange eftate, which has alfo been there a 
century. The former tenant in that family kept a piper 
to play to his (hearers all the time of harveft, and gave him 
his harveft fee : The floweft fhearer had always the drone 
behind him. In the firft part of this century, the tenants 
• not only lived together in one village, but each village was 
almoft entirely of one family, allied together by marriage 
and blood. 

Rotation of Crops. — Though every perfon purfues a rota- 
tion of crops of his own, there is no rotation common to all. 
The tenants on the eftate of Cupar-grange are bound to 
a rotation of fix years; three to be white crops, viz. 
oats, barley, and wheat ; and three intermediate crops re- 
fpe&amp;ively to be green crops, fuch as grafs, peafe, flax, tur- 
nip, potatoes, or fallow. The tenants on Lord Privy Seal's 
eftate are bound to have no more than two thirds of their 
land in crop, and to have one third in grafs ; the grafs to 
lie four years ; they are alfo bound to have half of their 
ground in grafs during the laft five years of the tack. 

Sowing and Reaping. — Wheat is fuwn in the months of 
October and November, a boll to an acre. It is fown after 
dunged fallow, or after potatoes that have been dunged. 
The quantity of dung to an acre is from 33 to 40 cart- 
loads. Thofe that are near, purchafe fome Cupar Angus 
dung; which, when unmixed with earth, is a valuable ma- 
nure.

nure 



It is purchafed at i s. 6 d. or a s. the cart-load. A. 
load of marl, at four miles diftance, would coft 50 d .con- 
taining c bolls. A load of lime, at fix miles diftance, 
would coft ias.6d. the 5 bolls. There is little or none of 
the two latter at prefent ufed here. Wheat, though lately 
introduced here, is moft congenial to the climate of any 
grain; as it alone, of all of them, (binds the winter, and is 
fooneft ripe, and ready to be removed from the autumnal 
ftorms. It is begun to be cut down about the end of Au- 
guft, or beginning of September. It has not, however, fuc- 
ceeded on high mountainous grounds. Four or five hun- 
dred feet of difference of elevation, makes a very great dif- 
ference of climate; and of grounds of the fame elevation, 
thofe neareft the mountains are the coldeft and dampeft foil. ' 

Oats are fown in the end of March and beginning of 
April, (a boll to an acre), frequently after grafs. They 
never get any dung, as they grow more luxuriantly, with 
lefs fatnefs of foil, than any other crop can do. They are 
reaped, laft of all the crops, about the end of September or 
firft of Oclober. There is almoft no market for oats, ex- 
cepting feed oats, which fell higher than the price of other 
oats ; bu*t oats are firft converted into meal, and then fold. 
The common people live on catmeal pottage twice a-day. 
It is the moft wholefome and palatable of all their food, 
being purely vegetable ; notwithftanding the reflection in 
Johnfon's Dictionary, that " oats are eaten by horfes in 
t* England, and in Scotland by men." Such food makes 
men ftrong like horfes, and purges the brain of pedantry. 
It produces hardy Highlanders, who by their ftrength and 
drefs are fo formidable to their enemies, that they call 
them, " Les diables des Montagnes.'* 

Peafe are fown in the end of April. They are not con- 
sidered as a valuable crop, except on account of the ftraw ; 
they are precarious to win in harveft.

weeks on the grafs. 

Potatoes are planted about the end of April . that mod 
commonly ufed is the kidney, an egg-lhaped white potato. 
There are likewife feveral other forts here. Two or three 
bolls of potatoes are cut and planted on an acre, a yard be- 
tween the rows, and a foot between the fets. They yield 
from 20 to 30 bolls and upwards an acre. The ground is 
tw.ce p oughed at leaft before planting; and they are hoed 
and drilled with the plough two or three times after They 
are, or ought to be, taken up before the end of September 
The rows are taken up by the plough, and gathered with 
children and others ; ploughed again, and harrowed before 
and after ploughing, and gathered at all thefe times. They 
are kept in winter generally under ground, but fometimea 
imperfectly, on account of the moifture getting down among 
them, and caufing them to rot, heat, and moot in thefpring. 
If they were to be kept dry in an ice houfe, they would 
be preferved all the year over from froft, damp, and vege-

Highland Society. But I doubt the Angularity of my pro- 
ject would operate againft my pretentions,— to keep a thing 
from froft in an ice-houfe ! 

The potatoe is the true root of Scarcity, which promifes 
to fet Famine at defiance. The poorer fort of people dine 
and fup chiefly on potatoes, in the feafon of them. But 
thofe that are in a ftate of fervitude, are commonly above 
eating potatoes. Potatoes * are ufeful for hories in the 
fpring -, they eat them raw. 

Turnips are fown the firft week of June in drills, the 
ground having been ploughed (and cleaned) two or three 
times before fowing. There is the fame fpace left between 
the drills and between the plants, as in the cafe of potatoes ; 
and they are cleaned and drefled in the fame manner. Sow 
them when the ground is wet, or prepare your ground, and 
wait for rain, even a fortnight. They are ready to take 
up by the middle of November ; fome of the balls of them 
are a foot diameter, feldom lefs than 6 inches. An acre 
feeds 2 cattle, and puts L. 3 Sterling worth of beef upon 
each. Both turnip and potatoes are dunged. 

Clover and ryegrafs f are often fown out with barley, 

fometimes 

* The fubftance called fhot ftars is nothing elfe than frofted potatoes. 
A night of hard froft, in the end of autumn, in which thofe meteors called 
falling ftars are feen, reduces the potatoe to the confiftence of a jelly, or 
foft pulp, having no refemblance to a potatoe, except when part »f the fldn 
of the potatoe adheres below undiflblved. This pulp remains foft and fluid 
when all things elfe in nature are confolidated by froft ; for which rcafon it 
is greedily taken up by crows and other fowls, when no other fuftcnance is 
to be had, fo that it is often found by man in the adlual^circumftance of 
having fallen from above,, having its parts fcattered and difperfed 0;, the 
fall, according to the law of falling bodies. This has given rife to the 
name and vulgar opinion concerning it.

Quantity and Weight of Grain.— -There are about 1500 
acres to the W. and 1800 acres to the E. of the confluence 
©f Eroch and Ifla ; in all 3300 acres; of which, 
896 acres are fown with oats ;

The eftates of Drimmie, Perfy, and Cally, fow befides 
about 260 bolls of oats, and 150 bolls of bear. The ave- 
rage produce in the low country part, is 5 bolls the acre of

gow meafure ; 20 to 50 bolls potatoes, being 4 heaped bar-

peafe firlot as 3 to 2 nearly ; the ftandard wheat firlot is 
very nearly equal to the Englifh bufhel, being 110th part 
larger. Good oats yield a boll of meal of 8 ftone for a boll 
of oats. Good barley yields a boll and a half of meal, or 
1 2 ftone, for a boll of barley. By the above weights, I

of which are equal to 171b. 6 ounces Englifh avoirdupois. 
The firlot of the parifh is the Dundee barley firlot, which is

firlot. The Perth firlot is a 25 th part larger than the true 
ftandard. Some farmers of late keep two barley firlots, 
one for Dundee and another for Perth. The Perth wheat 
firlot, which is ufed here, is alfo faid to be a 30th part lar- 
ger than the true ftandard*. The prices of victual have 
been fo variable of late, that nothing particular can be faid 
of them. The average of wheat fome years bygone was

be, by wanting the fubftance of the butter. Butter fells at 
10 d. the pound of 20 ounces Scotch, equal to 22 ounces 
Englith avoirdupois. Merchants retail it falted during win- 
ter, giving 16 ounces Englifti for a pound, by which the 
linwa y purchafer lofes 6 ounces. Cheefe is fold by the 
country people (22 lb. Englilh avoirdupois to the ftone) 
at 4 s. 6 d. and is retailed by the merchants at 16 of thefe 
pounds to the ftone. Thefe are grievous evils to the poor, 
and originate from not reftri&amp;ing the inhabitants, effica- 
cioufly, to the ufe oqly of one weight and one meafure. I 
have known an infbnce in churning butter, in which the 
cream, after more than ordinary labour, caft up only one 
pound of butter inftead of four, w hich it ought. By Handing 
a while to cool, and having the labour repeated over a^ain, 
it caft up the other thjee pounds of butter.

Tarn.— There is a good deal of linen yarn fpun in the 
parilb, and fome of it is weaved. The women fpin with 
both hands, 10 hairs a-day. The price of yarn has been as 
variable, of late, as that of victual, from 25 d. to 43 d. the 
fpindle. They fpin 12 hairs, fale yarn, out of the Englifli 
pound avoirdupois.

Mills.— There are two lint-mills in the parifh, and four 
corn-mills, for grinding. There are three mills ereded in 
the pariQi for threfliing corn. Each mill is driven by three 
or four horfes. It threflies a boll in ten more out of heat 
than is done by flails. But the mill breaks the wheat-fli a*f 
much, and unfits it for thatch. The expence of mounuiig 
one is L. 30 or L. 4 c Sterling. One of thefe has about 80 
revolutions of the threfhing-drum for one revolution of the 
horfe's wheel. But as the horfe's traa is eight times lar- 
ger than the circumference of the threming-drum, the 
threlhers move with-only ten times the velocity of the 
horfes. Thefe mills give fatisfaftion. 

Rent and Produce.— The whole rent of the parifh is 
L. 2467 Sterling- The crop and -annual induftry of the 
people is worth about four times that fum, little fhqrt of 
L. 10,000 Sterling. Of this, one-fourth goes to fow the 
ground, and furnifti implements of hufbandry ; one-fourth 
to pay the rent ; one-fourth to pay and maintain the fer- 
vants, (men's wages being from L. 10 to L. 13, and wo- 
men's wages L. 4 Sterling) ; and one-fourth to fupport the 
farmer's family. Before the farms were divided, and the 
late mode of farming adopted, there was only " ane to faw, 
« and ane to gnaw, and ane to pay the Laird witha'." This 
is fometimes the cafe ftrlli The flock and tiend of the 
whole parilh, according to the valuation of the prefbytery 
of Meigle, A. D» 1630, was 84 chalders 3 bolls 2 pecks of 
victual, and L.3I3 I : 4 : 10 Scotch of money ; and turning 
the money into viclual, at L. 100 Scotch the chaider, f  hich

value of the parifh at that time, therefore, was little more 
than half its prefent value. 

Stipend.^-The ftlpend is 6f chalders of victual, two parts 
oatmeal, and third part barley, and L. 33 :6 :&amp; Sterling of 
money. The prefent incumbent, who is a native of the 
parifh, was fettled, A.D. 1785. Mr Alexander Dun was 
minifter for 36 years before that - r and Mr James Ramiay, 
before him, was 47 years minifter of this parifti. He be- 
gan with the eentuiy r and was the firft Prefbyterian mini- 
fter after the Revolution : The people having retained the 
Epifcopal minifter 12 years after the Revolution, and ha- 
ving adhered to him fome time even after the fettlement 
of his fucceflbr. His name was Mr Rankin^ — The age of 
the church is not known r it was newly feated about 20 
years ago. The wood of the roof is 100 y ears old. The 
manfe was repaired five years ago. It is rnoftly all new, 
except the cupples and joifts, and floors, and part of the 
fore and back wall. It has flood about 70 years. The

merks Scotch. Englifh, arithmetic, and writing, are taught

of the parifh who has not been taught to read. 

Chapel, — A chapel of eafe was built about eleven years 
ago at North Perfy, for the accommodation of the people 
in the neighbourhood. It coft L. 150 Sterling, raifed by 
contributions in the country. It is flated, feated, and con- 
tains 400 people. The feat-rents and collections amount 
to about L. 30, which maintains the preacher. Applica- 
tion was made for aid from the Royal bounty, and from 
the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, without 
efte£t. In this laft cafe, the failure was partly owing to the 
want of concurrence on the part of landed gentlemen, to 
9 comply

comply with the rules of the Society, which require half of 
the preacher's falary to be made good by them. There is 
a burial ground at Cally. The chapel at Perfy is nine 
miles from the parifti- church. 

p oor .__There are at prefent 7 poor perfons on the lift, 
who get from 2 s. to 5 s. monthly, in all, L. 1 : 2 : 6, month- 
ly. The monthly collections are 8 s. L. 6 Sterling is raifed 
by an affeffment of 2 s. yearly on the L. 100 Scotch valued 
rent, paid equally by the heritors and tenants. The kirk- 
feflion had lent L. 100 Sterling to Mr Robertfon of Strath- 
loch, alias Baron Reid, which, afterhis failure, lay 25 years 
in captivity in the hands of his truftee, till it amounted to 
L. 147 Sterling, when it was again recovered. Moft part 
of that fum had not been three months in the hands of Ber- 
tram, Gardner, and Company, when it was again unfortu- 
nate. The feffion have L.40 at intereft befides the above. 
The fefiion-clerk's fee is L. 1 yearly. Five millings of 
monthly penfion is only 2 d. a-day ; when the poor people 
have no other fupport, it cannot detain them long from that 
country, where the weary are at reft. 

Wages. — When people are well, and in health, they dcf 
not provide for the days of infirmity, which may be many, 
nor think, of the years of which they {hall fay, they have 
no plealure therein. L. 5 Sterling were great wages ten 
years ago. Twice that fum is the common hire of men 
fervants at prefent ; and fome have the face to afk, and the 
luck to obtain, near three times that fum, befides food. The 
wages of a day-labourer are 8 d. or 10 d. a-day, befides 
food ; of a wright or mafon, 1 s. 8 d. or 1 s. 10 d. without 
meat ; of a man fhearer for the harveft, L. 2 Sterling ; of a 
woman, above L. 1, and meat ; of a man ftiearer for a day,

praftice of farmers to keep cottars, by which means people 
are not raifed on the grounds fufficient to perform the work. 
They think it more profitable to import them from the 
Highlands. A new cart cofts L. 6 Sterling; harneffing for 
it cofts L. 2, io s. An iron-headed plough, and caft metal 
mould-board, cofts L. a. A new harrow cofts 7 s. The 
threfhing a boll of oats cofts the 25th boll. 

Fuel. — Moft of the people bring any peats they ufe from 
the mofs of Cochridge, in the parifti of Kinloch, being feven 
hours in going and returning. Coals from Dundee or Perth 
are the chief fuel ufed by thofe that have carts to drive 
them. 

Bridges. — There was a bridge built over the Ifla, on the 
road from Cupar Angus to Fort George, by Government, 
in 1766. The arches are five. The middle arch is 30 feet 
above the fummer water ; and the road over is 1 5 feet 
wide. The road is fometimes impaflable, on the fouth fide, 
at high floods. The bridge is built nearly over the only 
two natural great ftones in the middle of the river, called 
the riding Jlone and the wading Jlone ; and as works of na- 
ture outlive thofe of art, they may fhew the place where it 
flood after it is gone. There is another bridge over the 
Ardle at Cally, on the fame road, and a bridge at Stron, 
over the Shee, on another road, both of one arch. There 
is a boat over the Eroch at Cupar-grange for foot people. 

Bendothy. — Bendothy was the parifti church of Cupar 
Angus before the abolition of Popery. The church was 
then more centrical for the parifti than it is at prefent. The 
feats of Keithick, in that pari fh, flood in the church here 
before the late' repairs. There is a ftone in this church 
upon Nicol Campbell, proprietor of Keithick, fon of Do- 
nald, abbot of Cupar, and grandfon of the Earl of Argyle,

who died, A. D 1587. aged 70. His brother, D^vid Camp, 
bell, proprietor of Denhead, (in Cupar pari(h), is alfo buried 
here. He died, A. D. 1584, aged 88. There is alfo a (tone on 
Leonard Leflie, (entitled, Dominus de Cupro\ commenda- 
tor of Cupar, who died, A. D, 1605, aged 81. There is a 
figure in the wall of John Cummin, proprietor of Couty, in 
this parifh, drcffed in a coat of mail, A. D. 1606. 

St Fink. There has anciently been a chapel at St Fink, 

dedicated to that faint. That part of the parifh which is 
eaftward of the confluence of h-roch and lfla, would feem, 
from its fituation, to have belonged to this chapel. The 
houfes near to it are called the Chapeltown, and the foun- 
dation of the chapel remains at St Fink. There has an- 
ciently been a burying-ground round the chapel. The pre- 
fent proprietor dug out lbme heads, without a body, (each 
inclofed between four fcjuare (tones, fitted to hold the head") ; 
probably the heads of people who had been (lain at a dif- 
tance in battle. There was a cairn of Hones on his eftate, 
which he alfo opened up, and below the (tones, among the 
loofe earth, which was black with burnt alhes, he found 
human bones, which had undergone fire ; and upon digging 
down into the firm ground below, he found two inverted 
urns, which had been placed in pits dug for them, each urn 
containing human bones ; the bones and urns were in per- 
fect: prefervation. The urns were large enough to hold the 
thigh and leg bones, and other bones, entire. They were 
adorned with rude fculpture, but had no infeription, 

Pittijh buildings. — In digging in the grounds of Mudhall 
feveralfubterraneous buildings were uncovered, which, when 
cleared of the alhes and earth with which they were filled, 
were found to be about 6 feet wide within walls, 5 feet deep, 
and 40 feet long, or more. They were built in the (ides, and 

paved 



Statiflical Account 



paved in the bottom with rough whin-ftones. In their 
length they were not ftraight, but a portion of a circle. 
It would feem that they had been roofed with wood, and 
covered above with earth and turf. They anfwer to Ta- 
citus's defcription of the buildings of the Germans : " They 
" dig caves in the earth, where they lay up their grain, 
" and live in winter. Into thefe theyalfo retire from their 
" enemies, who plunder the open country, but cannot dif- 
" cover thefe fubterraneous receffes." BeMor. Germ.c. 16. 
If people were obliged again to creep into a hole, they 
would know the value of good Government by the want 
of it. Their creft and edifice would not tower fo high as 
they do at prefent. 

Population— There are in the parifh 181 families, con- 
taining 878 fouls. The return to Dr Webfter in 1755, was 
1293 fouls; fo that the population has fuffered a diminu. 
tion of 417.

ted author of the Wealth of Nations obferves, that people 
-who live in the country have more intelligence than thofe 
in towns. Farming does not require many words, but 
much refle&amp;ion and obfervation, and great exertion and in- 
duftry. People that live in retirement are not fo expert 
in the ufe of words as they that live in fociety are ; but 
their tongues are better indexes of their hearts. They do 
not need to live on little traffic, which is a great enemy to 
truth and morals ; and are not always a match for thofe 
arts of trade, by which towns-people fometimes take them 
in. 



Religion, 13 c. — There is more of the external form, and, 
I believe, real fubftance of religion, here in Scotland, at. 
Jeaft on one day of the week, than is to be feen in other 
places out of Scotland. The clergy commonly repeat their 
fermons from memory, that they may avoid the preju- 
dices which would otherwife arife againft them from fuf- 
pecled want of ability and infpiracion, — prejudices, which, 
however groundlefs they may be in their caufe, are real 
in their confequences. Socrates, a wife man in his life, 
was certainly a fool at his death, which was occalioned 
by his defpifing the opinions of the people. Such as are 
difaffetted to the church, are, more commonly than other- 
wife, very indifferent about the ftate. It is Angular to fee 
qi- he^r of them lifting up one hand, in thek own way, to 

implore 



$f Bendothy. 



implore a bleffing 'on the gofpel, and ftretching out the 
other, to the enemy, to help to pull it down. They ftumble 
on that block, which bears the infcription, that the Pope is 
Antichrift. But who is Antichrift now ? He of his ene- 
mies? The Revelation of St John decides it : " He is An- 
« tichrift that denieth the Father and the Son." Why 4 
my friends, you care as little for the gofpel and the Sab- 
bath-day, as you do for the Pope, or the Eif ablifhment \ 
otherwife you would not expofe the lhame of your naked- 
nefs, by joining with Sans Cullotes, to dance with them upon 
the decade. One word more on this fubjeft, and I have 
done. Babylon was a great city, and no better than ic 
fhould be. Rome was a great city, and the whore of Baby- 
lon. Beware of making cities too great. They are ca- 
pable of making fudden tumults. It was not France, but 
Paris, that twice overturned the Government, and left eve- 
ry man to do that which was right in his own eyes. To 
prevent the exorbitant growth of cities may be done by in- 
dividuals, but is not to be attempted by (tatefmen. If the 
property of the nation were fpent by its poffeffors in pro- 
vincial towns, (rather than all collected at the metropolis), 
property would be lefs liable to the effcft of fudden con- 
vulfions. The mod defpotic and cruel of all governor* 
were the mobs of Athens and Rome. From fuch inhu- 
man mailers, Good Lord deliver us ! 

Canal. — A canal would be very beneficial to this, coun- 
try. It could be brought from P rt; , aiong the eaft bank 
of the Tay, as far as the head of the Sturmont-field canal } 
and could from thence be carried on higher grounds to Cupar 
Angus, from whence is level ground all along to the Lc-h

£W.--For two months of fummer there is a ftrong twi- 
light all night, fo that one can read ordinary print by it in 
the open air at midnight; the fun being only I0 degrees 
under the horizon. I n f ummer , in the ^ the thermQ _ 

meter ftands at about 6o on Farenheit's fcale, in warm 
weather above, and in cold weather below that point. 
There is almoft no difference between the Mate of the ther- 
mometer here, and that at Edinburgh, as printed in the 
newfpapers 3 in winter, the thermometer is very variable". 
One night, in December 1794, u was down a 4 ° below 
freezing. This was very uncommon. The W. wind is 
the moil common ; it is a dry wind. The N. wind is alfo 
dry, and blows in winter. The E. wind is accompanied 
with rain ; but in fpring it is fometimes dry. The S. wind 
is a wet wind, and feldom blows. The S. W. wind, which 
blows in the diredion of the ftrath, is the moft common of 
all others. The air is often flill at evening and morning, 
and then the S. W. wind blows at mid-day, and in the af- 
ternoon a good gale. The barometer is high in good wea- 
ther and froft, and falls after wind and rain. 

A great fall of fnow in winter feems to change the cli- 
mate above it from the time of its fall, while it continues 
upon the ground. It prevents the cold of the atmofphere 
from defcending to the earth, and the heat of the earth from 
afcending to the atmofphere. Ground that is not frozen 
when the fnow falls on it, will not freeze after. One day 
a good many years ago, I faw the hoar froft on the ice of 
the river r in the morning, half an inch long. It was fea- 
thered like fern, and had great refemblance to vegetation. 
The icy particles at that time clouded the atmofphere, and 
individually were vifible to the eye. Though the froft in 
December 1794 was the moft fevere ever known, there 
■was a pool of ftill water in Ifla river that did not freeze. 
I think that a complete coat of ice alters the temperature 
o of 



of Bendotby.

of the water under it, and prevents it from being cooled by 
the atmofphere, fo that it has not the fame difpofition to 
freeze as it had before it was covered. If hedges or dikes 
were railed 30 yards from the road fide, that fpace would 
hold all the driven fnow, and the road would be free from 



it. 



The crop 1795, having been a bad crop, and having rai- 
fed the oatmeal to 24 s. and the wheat to 50 s. the boll, a 
fketch of the weather may not be unacceptable. The froft 
began on the 18th December 1794, and continued to the 
4th of January. It began again on the 10th of January; 
mowed on the 19th and 20th, and continued deep fnow. 
March»3- there was fome blacknefs on the ground ; March 1 1, 
the river ice broke, and went down ; March 19. wreaths 
uill in hollows; Sidlaw hills ftill continued white; 
March 23. ploughs going; March 31. rain and flood; 
April 4. fowing; April 15. fnow nearly off Sidlaw hills ; 
May 9. fnowing; thermometer about 48 0 all May; all 
fummer below 60 0 except a day or two. The harveft dry 
till the 9th of Oaober, and wheat and barley partly in ; 
on the 9th of October a flood, wind S. E. ; on 10th, ano- 
ther flood ; barometer about 29^ ; rain continued to the 
18th, wind S. E.; barometer 297; thermometer 50 0 . Oc- 
tober 23, 24. dry, high wind, S.W.; barometer 287; ta-

ing upright in the fields. 

Phenomenon. — One night I obferved in the air a long 
narrow ftripe of a whitifh cloud, one end of which was near 
me ; its pofition was horizontal. The end next to me, as it 
advanced, became more red, bent into a curve ; then re- 
volved upon itfelf with a very quick fpiral motion, and 
the appearance of intenfe fire ; and though it was quite 
calm where I flood, the phenomenon was attended with the 

found 



Statiflical Account 



found of a whirlwind, which I would have perceived it to 
have been, had it been day-light, and a cloud of dull to 
make it vifible. 

Artificial Appearance^! believe much of the corrufca- 
tion of the Aurora Borealh proceeds from reflection in the 
atmofphere. One night I perceived the atmofphere illu- 
mined in quick fucceffion of red flames, like the Aurora, to 
an angle of 20 0 or 30 0 elevation, and found it was done 
by boys, burning pob-tow, about a mile diftant, and that 
the fucceffive corruptions of the atmofphere were occa- 
lioned by the toffings of the tow. 

Conje&amp;ure. — I have fometimes, in very clear nights, per- 
ceived the Milky-way to be a great circle in the heavens, 
palling near Aquila, Cygnus, Sirius ; and I find it goes 
through the fouthern hemifphere in the fame circle conti- 
nued. Its plane, therefore, is a plane which pafles through 
the centre of the earth. The conjecture I have founded on 
this is, that the Milky-way exhibits to us the pofnion of the 
univerfe, which is a plane (of fmall comparative thicknefs) 
lying in the pofition of the Milky-way. What fupports 
this conjecture is, that the fmall motion which the fun hag 
among the fixed ftars, is, in this plane, towards Aquila. 

Difeafes incident to Wheat — are the black and ruft. The 
black is the molt hurtful. The covering of the grain is en- 
tire, but within it is all black powder, which afterwards 
blackens, and hurts the found wheat. If you pull up a 
blacked {talk, all the ftalks that rife with it from the lame 
root are blacked likewife. It is mod common in rainy 
fummers ; no eff't dlual remedy is found. Potatoes are fome- 
times liable to the fcab or curl, elpecially if the ground b*

Maws on the road from the church- of Bendothy to the

Boethius, which came to my hand and knowledge, after I had formerly 
tranfmitted to the editor hereof the fubftance of what follows 
u TaCltUS ' " tHe Life of Ag' -ola, fays, that Agricola « ad montem Gram- 
pian, pervemt, qaem jam hoftes imederant;" arrived at Mount Grampius 
-here the Britons had already fat down ; which muft be fome place on the 
iide or the Gram pi an mountains, where they rife from Strathmore That it 
was beyond the eftuary of the Tay, may be meant by the words of Agricola 
on the occafion, « tranfifie arftaiaria." It was within the province of the Ho 
refti, the boundary or « finis" of which extended to the fhore and the fleet 
(» deduxrtexercitum in fines Horeftorum ;") from which he returned again 
through the territory of the newly conquered people: this cannot accord 
with any other place than Angus, and part of Perthlhire, eaftward of the 
Tay. 

The Buzzart Dikes on Garrydrums, in the parifh of Kinloch, (being 
• earthen dikes of 8 or 10 feet high, inclofing great part of a fquare mile), 
we take to be the place of Mount Grampius where the Britons had already 
fat down, " quem jam hoftes infederant," and which contained the « lsta 
" prasda vidtoribus." This place is near the tumuli, and the appearances of 
the field of adlion, and it is four miles N. from the Roman camp at Mickle- 
hour. As the camp flood on the grounds of the Horefti, the latter part of 
the word, Micklehour is the word aimed at by Tacitus. The Roman camp 
of Micklehour is formed by the confluence of Tay and Ifla ; it ftretches 
two miles along the Tay, two miles along the Ifla, and two miles and a 
half along the dike that inclofes it. It contains a prsetorium on the fide 
r:ext the Ifla. The above-mentioned dike is called Cleaven Dike, (that is, 
the dike of the fork or confluence) ; a mile and a half of it is /till ftanding 
towards the Tay. There is a draught of it in Stobie's map of Perthfliire ; 
but it cannot be traced within half a mile of the praetorium ; die map 
ftretches it out too far on the end next the praetorium. The Tay had for- 
merly run nearer the W. end of the dike than it does at prefent. Cleaven 
Dike is 20 feet broad at prefent, and about 5 feet high, and has been made 
'-'lit of two parallel trenches that arej20 yards from the dike on the oppofite 
fides of it. Cleaven Dike has openings at the W. end, and the middle, for 
the egrefs and ingrefs of an army. The camp has a fmall exploratory for- 
tification within it, on the top of an eminence. It lies in the parifh of Ca- 
puth. Clcnvcn Dike is the " vallum" of Tacitus. His expreflion would

vo the camp. The Roman legions, he fays, were drawn up « pro vallo, 
before the vallum of Cleaven Dike, at fuch diftance behind the battle, that 
they could be of no immediate fervice thefts; and therefore, upon feeing 
the number of the enemy, many advifed to bring up the legions, « plerique 
« admonebantarceflendaslegiones." A mile and a half weft from Mickle- 
hour is another Roman camp at Inchtuthill, a proud inch or lftand within 
the high flood-mark of the Tay ; and which the watch-place (or trenches, 
called the Steed's Stalls, in the parifh of Cluny), was intended to overlook: 
The laid trenches, 8 in number, fit to hold and conceal 100 horfes, being in 
a ftraight line between Buzzart Dikes and Inchtuthill. Another watch- 
place on the fame eminence overlooks the camp at Micklehour. 

The Stour-tnent, or main battle, happened in the heart of the Stormont, 
upon afcending ground, in the parifh.es of Kinloch, Cluny, and Blairgowrie, 
at the places called, Cairns, Upper Balcairn, Nether Er.icaira, Cairnbutts, 
and Craig Roman, on the fide of the Grampian ridge, between 3 and 4 miles 
N. from Micklehour, (Cairn being a common name given to artificial col- 
lections of ftones and earth laid over the dead). The afcent is interfedted 
by many Angular ridges, or drums, that run parallel to the bale of the 
mountain; thefearethe " colles" noticed by Tacitus, " erigere in collesaciem 
" ccepere." The Garrydrams, on which the Caledonian camp of Buzzart Dikes 
lies, are very Angular ground, being feveral high and narrow ridges or 
drums, (of which the farmer that occupies them obferved as follows, " Gen- 
" tlemen that come to fee this place fay, that they never law the like of 
" them in any country.") Thefe drums are mentioned by Tacitus in the 
words following : " Britanni, qui adhuc pugna? expeites fumina collium 
" infederant, degredi paulatim et circumire terga vincentium ccepcratrt." 
The Here Cairns of Gormak, below, and immediately contiguous, lying 
clofe together, about So in number, and about 15 feet each by 5 in height, 
mark the conteft that followed ; " quantoque ferocius accurrerant, tanto 
" acrius pulfos in fugam disjecifiet." 

The flight is ft ill to be traced by numerous tumuli, through Maws, in the 
paridi of Blairgowrie, along the track' that lies between the roofs of Coch- 
ridge on the W. and the river Eroch on the E. ; " grande et atrox ipectacu- 
" lum, — corpora, et laceri artus, et craenta humus." The Great Cairn of 
Maws lies in this tract, not far from the woody banks of the Eroch : " Ira

It was opened, in the centre, by the writer hereof, and found to contain hu- 
man teeth found, and a great quantity of human bones much reduced, which 
were mixed with charcoal, and lodged among loofe earth, having under- 
gone the fire, which contributes to the prefervation both of the bones and 
charcoal. This is the grave of the 340 Romans who fell. The Britons loft 
lo,ooo. I found burned bones alfo in a fmall tumulus adjacent. 

Compare what has been above faid with the words of Boethius the hif- 
torian. " Romani ad Taum haud procul a Caledonia? caftro (Dunkeklen) 
" confedere. Tulinam, ne Romanis dedita, illis refugium foret, concre-

« At ro"v pugna donee fera nox. IVIulta prodigia in Albione, antequam 
" Galdus nun Romanis pugnam iniret. Natum Tulinae monftrum." 

On the year following, he fays, " Romani noclu Tulinam adiere, indc 
" pontem, quern Tao, proximo anno, impofuerant, diruerunt." 

Concerning his authority he fays, " Ex quibus hanc hiftoriam collegi, 
? noftras gentis peculiariter Veremundus Archidiaconus S. Andrew, na- 
tione Hifpanus, qui ab exordio hiitoriam, ufque ad Malcolmi III. tem- 
pera cui opus dicavit, contexuit, (A. D. 1060) ; Turgotus, Campbellus, 
V quos tres, ex Iona infula, ad nos comportandos curavimus." And in 
another place, " Veremundi rude vetuftate hiftoria, abunde omnia com- 
" pleclens, quern anthorem fumus infequuti." ' 

It is unneceflary to obfenx on the above, that Boethius means that Agri- 
cola fought Galgacus in the Storm:nf, near Inchtuthill, and the eaft bank 
of the Tay. It is a pity that Veremund fliould be loft. His book may 
perhaps yet exift in the library of Aberdeen College, of which Boethius 
was Principal. More refpecl is due to Bcethius, as an hiftorian, than is 
commonly granted to him. They are his fadls, and not his prodigies, or 
opinions of the day, by which we are to acquit or condemn an hiftorian.

mentions the fcene near Blairgowrie as the mod likely place where Agri- 
cola fought Galgacus: Publifhecl A. D. 1774, at Perth. 

Fingal, the hero of Offian, is mentioned by Boethius, and his time con- 
jectured to be about tha departure of the Romans from Britain. " Conji- 
" ciunt quidem in hsec tempora Finanum filinm Cceli (Fyn Maccoul, vul- 
" gari vocabulo) virum, uti ferunt immani itatura, Scotici fanguinis vena-

ifland of Staffa, and a celebrated cave there. " We alked the name of it ; 
" the Cave of Fiuhn, faid our guide. . What is Fiuhn t laid we. Fiuhn 
" Maccoul, replied he, whom the tranflator of Cfiian's works has called 
" Fingal. Kow fortunate, that in this cave we lliould meet with the re- 
" membrance of that chief, whofe exiftence, as well as the whole epic 
" poem, is almoit doubted in England !" 

I was fo imprclled with the records of Boethius having a foundation in 
fact, that I fought for Fingal, and found him there ; but was lbmewhat dif- 
appointed to find, that Boethius knew more of him than he chofe to tell ; 
for he alfo is among the crowd of infidels, concerning the marvellous 
achievements of that hero.

(County of Forfar, Synod of Avgus and Mearns, 
Presbytery of Forfar).

<p>Name, Situation, ifc. 

HP HERE is no evidence that the name of this parifh has 
-** been changed. The more ancient orthography is 
*Tannadys or Tannadyfe. This name is moll probably of 
Gaelic origin. 

It needs fcarcely to be obferved, that this parifh is fitu- 
ated in the county of Forfar, in the prefbytery of Forfar, 
and in the fynod of Angus and Mearns. It extends about 
twelve Englifh miles from E. to W. ; in fome places it is 
eight or ten miles broad ; but, at an average, about four. 
It is bounded by the parifh of Cortachie on the W. ; by 
Outhlaw and Aberlemno on the S. ; by Fern and Carrald - 
ftone on the E. ; and by Fern and Lethnot on the N. 

The

The greateft part of the ground Is hilly or mountainous. 
The foil, in the lower parts of the parifh, is in general good. 
It is more inclined to clay than fand, except on the brink 
of the river Eflc. The air is dry, pretty fharp in winter, 
but in general wholefome. In former times the ague 
prevailed much, efpecially in one diftria, called the Glen 
of Ogil. But now the cafe is otherwife. The moft com- 
mon diftemper is the low nervous fever, which may indeed 
be confidered as the chara&amp;eriftic diftemper of this county. 
Twenty or thirty years ago, what is commonly called the 
louping ague greatly prevailed. This difeafe, in its fymp- 
toms, has a confiderable refemblance to St Vitus s dance. 
Thofe affe&amp;ed with it, when in a paroxyfm, often leap or 
fpringin a very furprifing manner, whence the difeafe has 
derived its vulgar name. They frequently leap from the 
floor to what, in cottages, are called the baulks, or thofe 
beams by which the rafters are joined together. Some- 
times they fpring from one to another with the agility of a 
cat, or whirl round one of them with a motion refembling 
the fly of a jack. At other times they run, with aftonifh- 
ing velocity, to forne particular place out of doors, which 
they have fixed on in their minds before, and perhaps men- 
tioned to thofe in company with them, and then drop down 
quite exhaufted. It is faid, that the clattering of tongs, or 
any noife of a iimilar kind, will bring on the fit. This 
melancholy diforder Hill makes its appearance ; but it is 
far from being fo common as formerly. Some confider it 
as entirely a nervous affedtion ; others as the effect of worms. 
In various inftances, the latter opinion has been confirmed 
by facts. 

There arc feveral mineral fprings within the bounds of 
this parifh, but none of any confequence. It contains no 
lake. But the want is amply fupplied by the beautiful 
South Efk, which in fome places forms the boundary of the 

parifh,

pariA, and in others runs through it ; and by the limpid 
JNoran, a ft ream which feeks jtg w&amp;y from ^ ^ E&amp; 

over a very dear and pebbly bed. The name of Elk is 
common- to a number of rivers in Britain; and the reafon 
Mobv,ous, as it literally fignifies bein^ the Celtic 

word Uijt or with very little variation. The manner 
Xfl Wnaeh the people of tftfe country generally fpeak of the 
North Elk evidently refpecls the meaning of the name ; 
for they call it the North Water. It is at leaft highly 
probable that South E&amp; may be viewed as a clafficSl river, 
as the Slejica of the Roman,. In the Itinerary of Richard 
or Cirencefter, ad Acficum is mentioned as one of the Ro- 
man nations in the province of Veipaliana ; and it is mark- 
ed as twenty three miles diilant from ad Tavtim, or one of 
the,r ftations on Tay. Now, although there are remains 
of a Roman camp at Kethick, near North Elk, the diftance 
does not anfwer j whereas there is a Roman camp at Battle- 
dikes, on the other fide of the river from Tannadice 

The banks of Elk prefent a variety of delightful and ro- 
mantic fcettes. By far the greater part of this parifh lies 
on the north fide of the river. Here many falmon and fea- 
trout ufed to be catched ; but of late years their number is 
much diminirned. Thh is greatly owing to the height of 
the dam-dikes erected further down the river. It is alfo a 
general complaint with thofe who are fond of Mining, that, 
■where there are cruives, no regard is paid to the old equi- 
table law concerning the Saturday's S/oppe. 

Here, a good number of years ago, a considerable liming 
was carried on in Elk for the frelh water oyfter, in order to 
procure pearls. Some of thefe were fo valuable, that L. 4 
have been given for one at the firfl market. One was got 

nearly

nearly as large as the ball of a pocket piftol. They were 
generally bought up, from thofe who fifhed for them, by 
people from Brechin ; and it is faid that this trade turned 
out to good account to fome individuals engaged in it. 
More than twenty years ago it was given up ; fome fay, 
that there was not the fame demand for the pearls as for- 
merly. It is aflerted, however, that the fhells were nearly 
exhaufted, by reafon of the great number of hands employ- 
ed in collecting them. 

The only remarkable mountain in this parifh is St Ar- 
nold's feat •, on the top of which there is a large cairn. The 
hills are coveted with heath, but are not rocky. The pa- 
rifh exhibits no appearances which may be called volcanic, 
in the common fenfe of the term. But one natural pheno- 
menon deferves to be mentioned. Near the eaftern extre- 
mity of the parifh is a fpot of ground, commonly called, 
the Deil's Hows, i. e. the Devil's Hollows. It has received 
this name from its being fuppofed that the devil has here 
given fome remarkable difplays of his prefence and power. 
It is a fmall hollow, furrounded with moorifh ground. At 
different times, within the memory of fome alive, pieces of 
earth, of 150 or 160 ftones weight, have been thrown out 
from the adjoining ground, without any vifible caufe. 
Upon examining the fpot, however, and digging to the 
depth of a foot and a half, or two feet, there appears a 
Jlrotum of a yellowilh colour, mixed with fmall ftones, 
thoroughly impregnated in the fame manner. At firft it 
feemed that the occafional eruptions might be partly owing 
to fome fulphureous fubftance confined here. But in con- 
fequence of fubjefting one of the ftones to a chemical pro- 
cefs, it appears to contain no fulphur, nothing but argilla- 
ceous earth and iron. When calcined, the fubftance forms 
a good red ochre. I have been informed by one who has 
refided many years in the neighbourhood, that fuch erup- 
' tions 



Statijlical Account 



tions have taken place in this fpot three or four times with- 
in his recollection, at the diftance of twelve or fifteen years- 
from each other. 

I have heard of no figured flone but one, which was 
lately found in the foundation of an old houfe; the back 
of which houfe formed part of the wall of the church-yard. 
It exhibits the figure of a man, very rudely cut, with his 
head uncovered, and having a loofe garment, like a High- 
land plaid, thrown over his moulders. With the one hand 
he lays hold of the mouth of an animal, which has been 
thought to be a lion, but has more appearance of a wild 
boar. With the other, he brandifhes a fword or dagger, 
with which he threatens deftrudlrion to his prey. There 
has been an infcription over the head of this figure, as 
would feem, in Saxon characters. But only two or three 
of thefe are now difcernible; as the flone has not only been 
broken into two pieces, but has been otherwife mutilated, 
by the unfparing hands of fome workmen employed to 
repair the wall. It is not improbable, that this might be 
an ancient grave-ftone. 

In a rock, at the weftern extremity of the parifh, exactly 
on the north fide of the bridge of Cortachie, a very coarfe 
kind of mai ble is found, in fm&amp;ll veins. Not far from this, 
in the parifh of Cortachie, is a rock, the ftones found in 
which, from the defcription given of them, feem to refera- 
ble quartz. They have fomewhat the appearance of gold, 
raoft probably in confequence of metallic impregnation; 
Whence the rock itfelf is called the Golden Craig. The pa- 
rifh of Tannadice abounds with free-flone and moor-ftone. 
The large ftones found in the field in detached pieces, are 
here generally called outliers, to diftinguilh them from 
thofe found in beds. There is alio abundance of the flone 
vulgarly called fcurdie, the fame which is commonly known 
by the name of whin in the weflern parts of Scotland, and 

ufed 



of Tannadice.

Ufed for paving ftreets. A bed of this kind of ftone is faid 
to extend to this parifli, from the Milntown of Mather, a 
place in the county of Kincardine, between Monnofe and 
John's-haven. Slate, of the grey kind, is found in the Glen 
of Ogil. 

Inundations are not frequent here. About twenty years 
ago, however, all the houfes in the farm-town of Jufting- 
haugh were fwept away by an inundation of the river Elk. 
Since that time a good deal of money has been expended in 
this quarter, in forming what are called heads, or angular 
banks of ftone, for keeping off the water on the north lide 
of the river. 

This parifh boafts of no remarkable quadrupeds. The land 
is infefted with foxes, and the water with otters. Roes 
fometimes come down from the hills, and lodge in the 
woods; they are very common in the higher parts of the 
pariih. There even the red deer abound. Belides par- 
tridge, groufe, the fieldfare, and other common birds, they 
have one called the ofwa/d, ov ofwat, very much reiembhng 
a blackbird. This, I fuppole, is what the Englifh call the 
oufel, and defcribe as the very fame with, the blackbird. 
What is here called the ofwa/d, however, pafles for a dif- 
ferent fpecies. Various birds of paffage make their ap- 
pearance here, as wild-geefe, fwallows, lapwings, woodcocks, 
dottrels, &amp;c. 

Many cattle are bred in this pariih. They are of an or- 
dinary lize. An ox fully grown often weighs 40 or 50 
ftones. 

By reafon of the parifh being vacant, no exa£t account of 
the population can be obtained. By Dr Webfter's account 
in x 755» it amounted to 1470. Fifty of fixty years ago 
there were 400 communicants ; now there are generally 
between 500 and 600, At an average, there are annually 
15 births, and 8 or 9 deaths. In the year 1794, however,

30 died. This was not the confequence of any particulate 
diftemper ; but this year proved fatal to a number of old 
people. Annually there are about 2,0 marriages. None 
have died, for a confiderable time paft, who have exceeded 
86 years of age. But there is one perfon living in the pa- 
rifh, who is above 90. 

As far as I can learn, the only Diffenters are a few of" 
the Epifcopalian communion. The parifh includes about 
106 farms, but not the fame number of farmers, as fome of 
them poffefs more than one farm. There has, it is laid, 
been, of late years, a decreafe as to population, in confe- 
quence of the converfion of fmall farms into larger, and 
the removal of a number of cottagers from their poffef- 
fions. None, indeed, have been under the neceflity of 
leaving the parifli for want of employment. Thofe who 
have left it have generally done fo from the caufes already 
mentioned, whence they have been obliged to remove into 
towns. It is fuppofed, that there may be about 200 ploughs 
in the parifh. In the lower part of it, they are generally 
fuch as are drawn by two horfes* In the higher, four are 
ivfed. The ploughs are moflly of the new conftru&amp;ion, 
with iron heads, and what are called metal boards. There 
are at leaft between 200 and 300 carts. The beft arable 
land is let at L. I, or L. 1, is.; inferior, at from 5 s. to 
15 s.per acre. From what has been already faid, with re- 
fped to the converfion of fmall into large farms, it mult be 
evident that the number of farms is diminifhing. 

There is not much ground inclofed with ftone fences. 
The farmers, indeed, are univerfally convinced of the ad- 
vantages Vifing from proper inclofures. But they are un- 
willing to fubmit to the expence •, and fome, eVen to pay 
the intereft of the money which the proprietors might ex- 
tend for this purpofe. The old plan of inclofing with

arethen fences is generally given up, except for prc-teding 
young trees. 

Not above one half of the land is laboured. The reft 
confifts of mountains, moors, and plantations. The parifh 
not only generally fupplies itfelf with provifions, but {pares 
'a conliderable overplus to other places. * In the years 178a 
and 1783 there was lefs fcarcity than during laft winter. 
The fupply of meal, given by Government a/mo 1783, for 
affifting thofe pariihes which were ftraitened for provifions, 
was found unneceflary here, Notwithstanding the general 
fcarcity this year, tittle grain has been imported into the 
parifh.. 

-No hemp is raifed here. But a conliderable quantity of 
ground is employed in the culture of flax, Although this 
of neceffity varies, it is fuppofed that, at an average, there 
may be 40 or 50 acres annually fown with flax feed. With- 
in die memory of forne ftill living, no grals-leeds of any 
kind were fown, Now, a great deal of land is laid out in 
this manner. 

A fmall quantity of marl was found, fome years ago, in 
a pit on the farm of Deirachie. But it was all expended 
on that farm. Very little lime is ufed, becaufe of the 
great length of carriage ; but a good deal of marl, which is 
brought from the Loch of Kinordie, in the parifti of Kirry- 
muir. Some of the ground is very productive. This year, 
in a haugh on the ellate of John Ogilvy, Efq; of Infhavan, 
I counted ix ftalks of oats growing from one root, the moft 
01 thefe from 5 feet 8 inches, to 6 feet high, and fome of 
them carrying between 140 and 150 grains each. 

A. confiderable part of the parifh is employed in pafture. 
The hills afford excellent pafture for fheep. Wedders are 
fomctimes brought down from the Glen of Ogil in ther 
month of Anguft, which weigh 10 lb. 'quarter, and give 
jo lb. of tallcw.

Tenpence cr i s. with meat, is the ordinary wages for a 
day-labourer in hufbandry, whether male or female, i s. is 
the ufual wages during harveft. A male-fervant in huf- 
bandry, befides board, receives L. 10 or L. 12 per year ; a 
female, between L. 4 and L. 5. Few carpenters, mafons, 
&amp;c. regularly labour in this parifh, A tailor works for 
10 d. a-day, with meat. The people are in general very 
induftrious. There are a few weavers, fome of whom are 
employed in the Ofnaburgh trade; but the generality in 
what i called country work, for the ufe of families. There 
has been a great alteration in drefs wkmn the laft twenty 
years. It is now far more expenfive than formerly. A 
great many articles of drefs are bought, which people ufed 
to manufacture for themfelves. 

The fuel ufed in the higher parts of the parifli confifts of 
peat and turf ; in the lower, of coals, furze, and broom. 
The greateft difad vantage under which this parifh labours, 
the lowe-r part of it at leaft, is the want of fuel. Coals muft 
be brought from Montrofe or Arbroath, both about twenty 
miles dillant. 

The roads are greatly improved of late. This year, 
L. 105 have been expended in making and repairing pri- 
vate roads, leading to the, turnpike-road newly formed be- 
tween Forfar and Brechin, part of which lies in this parifh. 
The general opinion is in favour of the turnpike-roads. 

The prices of provifion correfpond to thofe of the neigh- 
bouring parifhes. Butter, this year, (i79 6 ) fells at Is ' f" r 
lb. The price of cheefe is from 5 s. to 6 s. 8 d. per ftone, 
according to the quality. 

The broad Scotch is the only language fpoken here. Some 
of the names of places are of Gaelic, and others of Gothic 
origin ; although the former feems to abound rooft. To

furrounded with water. Befides the evident tautology of 
fuch a defignation, there is no reafon to fuppofe that it was 
ever defcriptive of the lituation of the place. The mean- 
ing given to Achlouchrie, which, it is faid, means the cow- 
haugh, is more natural, as it correfponds to the local fitua- 
tion ; for a confiderable part of the grounds, which receive 
this name, lies low on the border of Efk. Barn-yard*,

ied anno 1614, they are defigned the ecckfiajlical lands of 
lannadyfe. The tithes are all exhaufted. The old ftipend 
eonfifted of one-third of the value of the tithes, amounts 
ing to 1000 merks Scotch, with 100 for providing ele- 
ments. The ftipend has been lately augmented to L. ioq 
Sterling, exchifive of the glebe. 

The oldeft regifter extant reaches no farther back than to 
the year 1693. Mr George Lyon, who feems to have been 
Epifcopalian minifter here for many years, was allowed to 
continue till the year 1715 ; when, on account of the ftate 
of public matters, many minifters of this perfuafion, who 
had been formerly fuffered to keep pofl'effion of the parifh 
churches, and to enjoy the livings, were turned out. He 
was fucceeded by a Prelbyterian minifter of the name of 
Oliphant; and he, anno 1724, by Mr John Ogilvie, for- 
merly minifter of Cortachie and Clova, Mr John Weath 
was fixed here, a/mo 1743 ; and was fucceeded by Mr John 
Buik, anno 1767. He died in March laft. The church is 
prefently vacant. During Mr Weath's incumbency both 
the church and manfe were repaired. The church is fup- 
pofed to be pretty old ; but it is not known when it was 
built. 

Eleven or twelve perfons ufually receive alms. The 
contributions for the relief of the poor annually amount to 
about L. 30. A fmall fund, which produces L. 1 per year ? 
was left, for their benefit, by Mr Ramfay of Kinaltie. 

This parifli furnilhes very little to pleafe the tafte of an 
antiquary. On the north fide of Elk, very near the place 
where the bridge of Shealhill now ftands, formerly ftood 
the caftle of Quiech, the rcfidence of the Earls of Buchun, 
Who, in ancient times, had an extrnfive property in this 
county. The fituation h romantic; and was ftill more 
adapted for being the Teat of a feudal chiettam, by the fecu~

rity which it promifed, than by its pleafantnefs. The 
cattle was built on a precipitous rock, immediately over- 
hanging the river. This rock appears as if infulated by na- 
ture. A ftream pours down through a deep chafm on each 
fide of it. Thus itfcarcely required any artificial means ol 
defence. No veftiges of this ancient caftle are now -dif- 
cernible. A humble cottage occupies its place. Within 
thefe few years, part of one of the walls of the chapel was 
ftanding. It was neatly built with hewn ftones. But they 
have been lately carried off, and applied fome other way. 

A hill, in the neighbourhood of Achlouchrie, receives 
the name of the Cajllehill. Like the fite of the caftle of. 
Quiech, it,overhangs the river, which here runs in a deep 
bed, by reafon of the high rocks on either fide. A foffe* 
ftill twelve feet deep and thirty wide, forms a femicircle 
round this hill. This, it is fuppofed, had been dug with a 
deficrn to bring in water from the river for defending the, 
place. It Would feem, however, that there never has been 
any building here, as there are no marks of foundations. 

Near the village of Tannadice, there is a place called t/ji 
Cajile of Barnyards. According to the tradition of the 
country, a gentleman of the name of Lindfay began to ere£t 
a caftle here ; but having killed the proprietor of Finhaven. 
in a quarrel, near this place, was obliged to fly. Thus, it is 
faid, the building was never finifhed. Within thefe few 
years, feveral of the vaults were ftahding ; and fom eof the 
walls, from five to feven feet in height. But the ftones 
have been employed for building on the farm. Some cen j 
turies ago, great part of this county was in the poffeffiori 
of the Lindfays, whofe chief, the Earl of Crawford, had his 
refidence at Findhaven, a little way from this, on the other 
fide of the river. The Lindfays, formerly of Glenquiech, 
pretended to be the proper heirs of the lands of Barnyards.

(County of Banff, Synod of Moray, Presbytery 
of Strathbogie). 



"By the Rev. Mr James Simmie.</head> 



<p>Situation, i£c. 

T I 1 HE parifh of Rothiemay is bounded, on the E. and 
N. E. by the parifh of Marnoch ; on the S. and S. E. 
by Inverkeithnie, Forgue,. and Huntly ; on the W. and 
S. W. by Cairny; on the N. and N. W. by Grange. Its 
greateft length is from 7 to 8 miles ; its greateft breadth 
from 5 to 6. 

The northern part of this parifh is inferior to the reft, 
both in fertility and beauty. Befide, fome hilly ground, 
and fome .plantations of fir, it confifts of a large plain, con- 
taining partly arable, partly pafture-ground, and an exten- 
five mofs that fuppli es with fuel, not only the parifhioner 3 ,

but, in a great meafure, the town of Huntly *, which is 
diftant about 6 miles. From this plain is a gentle declivi- 
ty of more than half a mile, on the W. and S. W. to the 
Ifla, and, on the S. to the Devoran ; a river adorned with 
plantations and natural woods on its banks, and abounding 
with common trout, eel, and falmon. About a mile be- 
low its confluence with the Ifla, the Devoran, running eaft- 
ward, divides the parifh into two parts, of which the north- 
ern follows the courfe of the river more than two miles, 
the fouthern near two miles farther. At this point, where 
the Devoran begins to divide the parifh, and on its north- 
ern bank, are the Miiltown, a fmall village containing 
about an hundred fouls; the houfe of R othiemay f ; the 
church and manfe •, and a happy mixture of well-inclofed 

fields 

# When the parifhioners carry peats out of the parifli, they do fo clan- 
deftinely, or merely by indulgence of their landlords, — not by ftipulation 
and right. It is much to be wifhed, that both they, and others whom they 
fupply ivith peats, would ufe fewer peats, and more coal and wood, not 
only becaufe, in wet feafons, peats are a very uncertain fuel, but becaufe 
the preparation of them confumes much of their time, which might be 
more profitably devoted to various agricultural improvements. 

f There is a tradition here, that the unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, 
pafled a night in this houfe, and her bed-room is ftill pointed out. This 
tradition is confirmed by the authority of Buchanan, who, defcribing 
Mary's journey to Invernefs, fays, " Proximo- nox ad Rothimaium, Abre- 
« ncthiorum villain, fatis tranquille tranfaRa ejl :" Hift. Rer. Scot. 
Lib. 17. cap. 36. The Abernethies here mentioned were- Lords Aber- 
nethies, afterwards of Salton. The. tragical fate of one of them is cele- 

' brated in a popular ballad, called Frennet-hall. : Next to the Abernethies, 
a family of Gordons were proprietors of Rothiemay till the end of laft or

fields and woods; which, with woods and corn-fields on 
the oppofite fide of the river, rifing, by a gradual afcent, to 
a great height, form a beautiful rural fcenery, equalled by 
few, and perhaps excelled by none, of equal extent, in the 
kingdom. 

Soil, Produce, ifoz*.— Plantations and natural woods oc- 
cupy a confiderable part of this parifh. They confift 
chiefly of fir, birch, afh, elm, and aller *, which, in confe- 
quence of the fcarcity of thefe in moft of the neighbouring 
pariflies, are fold at high prices, and bring the proprietors 
from L. ico to L. 200 a-year. And it may be prefumed, 
that, fome years hence, they will bring much more, as 
mafiy of them, efpecially firs, now young and thriving, will 
then be ready for fale ; and as the proprietors not only fup- 
ply from their nurferies the places of thofe they fell, but 
are carrying this kind of improvement ftill farther, by 
planting fuch parts of their eftates as are lefs fit for culti- 
vation or pafture. 

The pafture bears only a fmall proportion to the arable 
land of the parifh. It is fuch, however, as renders it pro- 
fitable for fome farmers to rear a few fheep, and all a few 
black cattle, for the market. 

The foil, in general, is rich and fertile. It produces ex- 
cellent oats, bear, peafe, and lint, the common crops of the 
parifh ■, and in fuch abundance, that large quantities, parti- 
cularly of oats, oatmeal, and bear, are exported annually. 
A great part of the bear finds a good market at diftilleries 
m the neighbouring pariihes. Part of it, as well as oats

and oatmeal, is purchafed, by commiffion, for merchants in 
other parts of the kingdom, and fhipped at Portfoj, which 
is 12, Banff, which is 15, or Macduff, which is 16 miles 
diftant. 

Moft farms are fmall, only five or fix being rented above 
L. 40, of which one is rented at L. 110, another at L. 140. 
Few leafes exceed t 9 years. Grqtfums are in ufe. Per- 
fonal fervice * and harveft-labour are no longer exacted. 
Of late, a great part of vi&amp;ual-rents were converted into 
money at the rate of 12 s. 6 d. a boll; and multure-rent, 
formerly every thirteenth peck, is now 3s. 6 d. for every 
pound of farm-rent, Converfions not lefs favourable in 
their confequences to the progrefs of agriculture, than to 
the immediate intereft of the farmer. The miller's fee 
(which remains to be converted into money) is every eigh- 
teenth peck. Aftri&amp;ions to particular mills prevail here, 
as in other parts of Scotland ; and the grain of one of the 
beft diftricls of the parifh is aftricled to a mill in a neigh- 
bouring parifh, and belonging to a different proprietor. 
Would it be any difadvantage to fociety, if mill-afrrictions 
of every kind being abolifhed by a juft compensation, every 
one were at liberty to choofe his miller, as well as his 
fmith, his carpenter, or any other mechanic ? 

The valued rent of the parifh is L. 3170 Scotch. The 
whole parifh is the Earl of Fife's, except about a tenth 
part, the property of Major Alexander Duff of Mayen. 
His Lordfhip occafionally vifits his property here. Major 
Duff f conftantly refides in the parilh.

the fliore is ftill retained ; nor, indeed, could it be conveniently difpenfeel 
with, where viclual-rents are paid, and efpecially where die landlord does 
not refide. 

f The Major, befide fome very laudable improvements of his eftate by 
planting and inclofing, has lately built an elegant and commodious houfc.

Advantages, tfc.—Ouv chief advantage, refpefting agri- 
culture, is the nearnefs of lime. In the neighbouring pa- 
nfh of Grange, it is bought at the quarry for i| d. ; at the 
kiln for 8 d. and fometimes 7 d. a boll * The abundance 
of peat here induces mod farmers to buy it at the quarry, 
and enables fome of them, befide fupplying themfelves, to 
bring a profit by retail. There are about 50 lime-kilns in 
the parifli. 

To this advantage I with I could add good roads ; but 
the proper method of making and repairing thefe is not 
even underftood here. Inftead of ufing for this purpofe 
that abundance of metal and gravel which nature has fup- 
plied, the ftatute-labour is employed in throwing on the 
middle of the roads the contents of the ditches on their 
fides, which, being clay or foft earth, fo far from impro- 
ving them, (unlefs, perhaps, during the heat of fumnier), 
generally makes them worfe than before. Though inclo- 
fing is far advanced in this, compared with neighbouring 
pariflies, ftill there is much room for this kind of improve- 
ment : A proof, among others, that a great part of our 
land has not yet reached half its value. Nor has draining 
by any means obtained that degree of ^attention, which a 
great part of our land evidently requires, though to this 
kind of improvement its natural lituation is, in general, 
very favourable \. 

Population, is'c. — The number of inhabitants is 1 125 ; of 
whom, 481 are males, 644 females. In 1755 it was 119c. 
The average of marriages for the laft 10 years is 10 ; that 
of births, for the fame period, 19 ; of deaths there is no re- 
gifter.

All the men who are not tradefmen and mechanics, are 
employed in agriculture ; and tradefmen and mechanics, 
who are houfekeepers, likewife cultivate a few acres for 
the accommodation of their families. The women, when 
they are not employed in the mofs in fummer, or the field

fervant's yearly wages are from L. 7 to L. 9 ; a maid-fer-

with the kind of his labour ; vi%. for mofs-labour, a man's

1 s. both without victuals ; a tailor's, ^8 d. with vi&amp;uals ; a 
diker's work is hired by the piece. By fpinning linen- 
yarn, a woman earns 3^ d. at moft 4 d. a-day ! A poor pit- 
tance, indeed ! and till manufactures be eftablilhed here, 
(a thing more to be defired than expected), there is little 
reafon to hope that female labour will find a better, at leafl 
an adequate reward. 

Church, School, b'c — The parifh-church, built about 40 
years ago, is commodious and well lighted. The Earl of 
Fife is patron. By a late decree of the Court of Teinds, 
the minifter's ftipend is " 106 bolls 3 firlots of victual, half

The fchoolmafter's falary, which is 200 merks Scotch *,

he d.ed, without having fulfilled his benevolent purpofe, and (fo far as I 
have yet been able to difcover) without leaving the fulfilment of it in truft

Antiquity, an Eminent Char after. — About a furlong 
north from the houfe of Rothiemay is a Druidical temple, 
which, though fituated in the middle of a beautiful and fer- 
tile field, a veneration for antiquity has hitherto preferved 
entire. Mr James Fergufibn, well known, among men of 
fcience, for his publications on aftronomy, was a native of 
this pariih +.

* In 1783 and 1784, the number of poor was 45. In 1783, the kirk- 
feffion expended L. 70 of the poor's fund in purchaling foreign grain. 

f To certify this, it may be proper to fubjoin, that my information of 
Mr Ferguflbn's being a native of this parifli I received from his brother, 
John Fergufibn, who was an elder of this parifli, and died very lately. He 
told me, that his father's name was John Fergufibn, his mother's Elfpet 
Lobban; that they dwelt at the Core of Mayen; that both he and his bro- 
ther James were born there; that he himfelf was born in 1708 ; and that 
his brother James was two years younger. Accordingly the feffion-record, 
which is now before me, confirms this information in every particular. 
James Fergufibn was born April 2 J. 17 10. 

I do not recoiled: every particular related in the Memoirs of Mr Ferguf- 
fon, prefixed to his works, not having feen them for feveral. years; but 
John, his brother, who had read thefe Memoirs, faid, that, though generally 
agreeable to fuel, they were not equally correct in every particular.

the virtues of integrity and friendmip. Of the form of

as candour, forbids me to believe that they are deflitute ef

By the Rev. Mr Liddell, Minifler.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

ORPHIR, or, according to the Icelandic hiftorians, for- 
for, is compounded of the Norwegian words, j'ord, 
land, and for, fire. This etymology is the more probable, 
as the parifh of Orphir ferves the neighbouring towns of 
Kirkwall and Stromnefs with a fpecies of peats, diftinguilh- 
ed by the name of/a/j/o, that is, fire-land, or earth fit for 
burning. And to the prefent day, there is a houfe and 
diflri£t called Tarfo. from its neighbourhood to a large mofs 
of this dcfcription.

Situation and Extent. — This parifh. is fituated in the 
county and fynod of Orkney, and in the prefbytery of Cair- 
fton, and makes a part of the ifle of Pomona, commonly 
called Mainland, from its being the largeft of the Orkney 
iflands. 

It is bounded on the N. W. and N. by the parifhes of 
Sternes and Firth, from which it is divided by a range af 
lofty hills ; by the parifh of Kirkwall on the N. E. ; and 
on the E. S. and W. by the Orkney Mediterranean, gene- 
rally known by the name of Scalpa Flow. 

It is about eight Englifh miles long, and from two to 
three miles in breadth ; lying along the fea-fhore, nearly 
in the direction of N. E. and S. \V, and enjoys a fine ex- 
pofure. 

The face of the parifh is diverfified with hills and dales 
through which many rivulets flow. The foil, in a few 
places near the coaft, is a rich loam, mixed with (tones, 
and tolerably fertile ; but, in general, it is clay or mofs, or 
a mixture of both ; and when well manured, though but 
indifferently Cultivated, is more than fufficient to maintain 
the inhabitants. 

The upper part of the parifh, except a few fmall farms, 
near a lake, called the Loch of Kirbifter, is hilly, and 
chiefly covered with heath, intermixed with coarfe grafs, 
and well adapted for the breeding of fheep and fmall cattle. 
The lower part, toward the S. E. S. and W. and extending 
about a mile from the hills to the fea-fhore, is in general 
plain, and beautifully diverfified with corn-fields, meadows, 
and green pafture. The eaftern diftrift is interfperfed with 
riling grounds, covered with heath, and large peat-moffes, 
which furnifkthe inhabitants with fuel, and- enable then* 
to fupply the neighbouring town of Kirkwall. 



Climatt. 



Stati/lical Account 



Climate.— -From the fituation of thefe iflands, in a north - 
ern latitude, and furrounded by the ocean, the difeafes in - 
cident to a cold and damp climate might naturally be ex- 
pected ; but the revcrfe happens. The ague is net known 
here, and fcorbutic complaints feldom occur j owing, per- 
haps, to the abundance of fuel, to the frequent ufe of vege- 
tables, and of malt liquor ; and above all, to the falubrious 
lea-breezes, which cool the air in fummer, and counteract 
the frofts in winter, and render the climate, upon the whole, 
more temperate, than in many places of a more foutherly 
latitude upon the continent. The fmall-pox was much 
dreaded here previous to the 1757, when inoculation was 
introduced, and has ever fince been attended with uncom- 
mon fuccefs. Confumptions are not frequent. The moil 
prevalent diftempers are fevers, which frequently prove 
fatal, efpecially in years of fterility. Rheumatifms have 
become more frequent of late years, owing ? it is fuppofed, 
to the fubftitution of the linen fhirt for the woolen wailt- 
coat, formerly worn by the common people. 

Mineral Springs — are to be met with in every difliicl: of 
the parifh. But the one moft in vogue is the water of 
Scoridale, which has been famous for time immemorial, and 
is fuppofed to cure all difeafes. It, like all the others, is of 
the chalybeate kind, without any mixture of fulphur. It 
is of a diuretic and antifcorbutic quality, and helps to pro- 
mote digeftion. 

Lakes, Coajls, I/lands, and Fi/heries. — There are in tins 
parifh feveral fmall rivulets, but only one lake, called the 
Loch of Kirbifter. It is between two and three miles in 
circumference, and is well ftored with lea-trout of an ex- 
cellent quality. The fall from this lake is very confider- 
able, and turns one of the finefl mills in the country. Hn e

seas formerly a waukmiil, but it was fufFered to go into de- 
cay, after the introduction of the linen manufacture. There 
are two other mills in the parilh, which go under the name 
of Dubmills. Thefe are of no ufe in the fummer feafon. 

The fea-coaft forms a circuitous courfe of about 12 miles, 
and is finely indented with bays and creeks, where veffels 
may anchor ; one of them in particular, called the Bay of 
Houton, is protected by an ifland at the entrance, and forms 
a fafe harbour for fmall veffels. The fhore, except in the 
bays, is in general bold, confifting of rocks of from 40 to 5* 
feet high ; and compofed partly of whin, but chiefly of « 
freeftone. The water, within a gun-mot of the fliore, is 
from 12 to 20 fathom deep. 

Scalpa Flow. — The fea oppofite to this coaft is a rnoft 
beautiful piece of water, being a fmall mediterranean, of 
about 50 miles in circumference. It is furrounded with. 
12 diffeient iflands, through which are feveral outlets to the 
Pcntland Firth, and German and Atlantic Oceans. This, 
particularly in time of war, is the great thoroughfare for 
Ihips coming north about. It abounds with fafe roadfteads 
and fine hat bout s •, fuch as Holm Sound, Floxa Sound, St 
Margaret's Houp, Pan Houp, and Long Houp in the Ifland 
of Wall? •, where there is good anchorage, and a fufficient 
depth of water for the largeft mip in the Bntifti navy. The 
principal entrance to Scalpa Flow, is through Holm Sound 
on the E. and Hoymouth on the W. ; near which Hands 
the village of Stromnefs, a fea-port, too well known to need 
defcription here, and poffeffed, for its fize, of one of the 
fined natural harbours in the world. 

Two miles diftant from the fouthmoft part of Orphir 
lies the ifland of Cava, a mile long, and about a quarter of 
a mile broad. There are only three families in the ifland, 
confilting at prefent of 19 perfons. The foil is a mixture 
pf clay and mofe, which, as they have plenty of fea-ware, 

feldom

feldom fails to produce a good crop. Befides 9 horfes and 
16 cows with their calves, thej ;have a few rabbits, and 
peats in abundance. The few inhabitants frequent the pa. 
m church, and are very regular in their attendance upon 
divine worlbip. There is a ruinous chapel in the ifland, 
round which is a church-yard, where they formerly ufed to 
bury their dead. 

In this fequeftered fpot, feemingly pointed out by nature 
as a place for religious retirement, in the memory of people 
now alive, have been committed two rapes and one mur- 
der. The murder is faid to have happened in felf-defence. 
The rapes were committed by Gow the pirate's people, 
who carried off two young women from the ifland ; and 
after keeping them for fome days aboard their lhip, re- 
turned them to their friends, loaded with prefents; and 
they both foon afterwards got hufbands. 

There is another fmall ifland in this parifli, fit only for 
fheep-pafture, called the Holm of Houton j a name general- 
ly given to fmall uninhabited iflands 

About a mile E. from the ifland of Cava lies a rock, or 
fkerry, well known to feamen, called the Barrel of Butter ; 
here was formerly a feal-fiihery, for which the neighbour- 
ing farmer paid the proprietor a barrel of oil yearly, until 
the frequency of flapping feared them from the rock ; then 
the proprietor, determined not to lofe his rent, converted 
the tack-duty into a barrel of butter j which is ftill paid by 
the tenant, and thence the rock is faid to derive its name* 
Its ancient name was Carlin Skerry. 

The principal fifliery on the coaft of Orphir is the dog- 
fifliery, which, for the time it lafts, is highly beneficial. 
Thefe fifli arrive, in fucceffive Ihoals, about the time of 
new and full moon, and are obferved to trarel weftwards. 
They make their appearance about the middle of June, and 
continue for a few days only at a time, until the end of 

Auguft,

Auguft. They are taken within half a mile of the more, 
in from 20 to 30 fathoms water, - with a common hand-line 
of half a crown value. One man will fometinaes catch fif- 
teen fcore in a day. They yield a great deal of oil ; and 
when cured and fmoaked, are thought to refemble kipper. 
Their value, per hundred, may amount, at an average, to 
5 s. There are in this fifhery abcut 24 boats employed, 
with 4 or 5 men in each. When the dog-fiftiing fails, 
which fometimes happens, the people are in the utmoft dif. 
trefs for want of oil •, which then rifes from 6 d. or 8 d. per 
Scotch pint, to 1 s. or even is. 6 d. During the reft of 
the year, they feldom catch any thing but a fmall fifh call- 
ed keiths or lillocks. Thefe fifh fmoaked, together with 
the lillocks, conftitute a great part of the food of the inha- 
bitants. 

Scalpa Flow abounds with many other kinds of fifh, 
fuch as fcate, flounders, haddocks, mackrel, and occalionally 
herrings. But the inhabitants are fo much employed in 
making of kelp, which is the great article of Orkney com- 
merce, that they have not leifure to attend to this fifhery. 
The common kinds of Ihell-filh are alfo to be found here, 
fuch as lobfters, partans, fpouts and cockles ; there are like- 
wife a few feals, and otters, whofe Ikins are valuable. 
Sometimes, too, the fmall whales, called the bottle-nofed, 
make their appearance on this coaft, and when embayed, 
are furrounded with boats, and forced on more. 

There are no fewer than fifteen fmacks employed through- 
out the feafon, in fiihing and carrying lobfters to the Lon- 
don market, all of which rendezvous in one or other of 
the harbours of Scalpa Flow. This fiftiery is confidered as 
very beneficial to the inhabitants of the adjacent coaft, who 
are chiefly employed in catching the lobfters, and receive 
from 1 d. to ltd. per piece. The boats fitted out for this 
purpofe meafure 12 feet of keel, and together with the nets, 

coft 



400 Statijiical Account 

coft about L. 6. There are two men in each boat, who 
will clear, at an average, L. 7 Sterling a-piece, during 
the fiftiing-feafon, which, including that of the fpring and 
harveft, does not laft above fix months in the year. 

Kelp. — Of this article, about 50 tons, at an average, are 
fnanufa&amp;ured, and exported yearly. The moll expert 
kelp-burners in Orkney are fuppofed to belong to this pa- 
rim ; the confequenee of which is, that they are univerfally 
employed. One farmer in particular, Nicol Slettar in 
Yarfo, by his fuperior fkill in furveying, and fixing with 
precifion the value of fliores, has deferved well of his 
country, having thereby confiderably augmented the in- 
come of many of the proprietors. This man, by dint of 
experience alone, and natural fagacity, without the aid of 
education, will afcertain, with aftonifhing exattnefs, the 
greateft quantity of kelp to be produced from any diftricl 
of mores, which he is employed to furvey ; but, like moft 
men of merit, he has been poorly rewarded. 

Of this great ftaple of Orkney commerce, much might 
be faid : But, as the fubjeft has been already anticipated in 
former Statistical Accounts, the author of the prefent re- 
port would only wilh to add, for the fake of his country- 
men, and upon the authority of the firft manufacturer in 
Newcaftle * " That, excepting barilla, which is fometimes 
not to be purchafed for any money, the beft crown glafs 
cannot be made without a certain proportion of Orkney 
kelp 1 and that, if the proprietors would be at the pams to 
prepare this article in the beft manner, and to preferve ,t 
pure and unadulterated, the price it would bring at market 
is fcarce'credible. 

The tang, or fea-weed, which grows on this and the 
neighbouring coafts, is found to be fit for burning only once 
in three years-, whereas, in the gu'4 of Sanday, and fome 



ofOrphir. 40 r 

•f the fmaller iflands, the fame kind of fea-weed is burnt 
yearly. This is generally afcribed to their proximity to 
the ocean, and the rapidity of the tides ; but, as there are 
many fimilar fituations, from which the fame effect is not 
produced, it is more reafonable to afcribe this phenomenon, 
either to the peculiar nature of the rocks on which thefe 
weeds grow ; or, with greater probability, to the fituation 
and foil of thofe iflands, which are fo narrow, flat, and fan- 
dy, as hardly ever to attract a cloud, or produce the fmalleft 
rivulet from one end to the other ; by which means the 
fea-weed, being preferved from freih-water, which is its 
greateft enemy, is permitted to grow in its utmoft perfec- 
tion. 

Tides, Bays, Headlands, and Wrecks. — The tide, at its en- 
trance into Scalpa Flow, is uncommonly rapid ; but it gra- 
dually fubfides, until it becomes fcarce perceptible. The 
courfe of the flood, with a little variation, is from W. to E. 
There is one part of the coaft, adjacent to the houfe of Mr 
Honyman of Graemfay, where the current, intercepted by 
a reef of rocks, runs 9 hours in one direction, and 3 in the 
oppofite. 

The principal neffes and headlands are Voenefs, Toi- 
nefs, Bernori, and Houton-head. The bays are, Waukmill 
Bay, Smugro Bay, and the Bay of Houton, all of them 
fronting the S. and S. E. •, in each of which, particularly 
the laft, fmall vefTels may anchor with fafety. 

Only two fhipwrecks have happened here in the me- 
mory of any perfon now alive. The one happened about 
30 years ago, upon the rocks of Hobbifter, where the veffel 
went to pieces, but the people were faved. The other in 
fpnng 1793, on the fand of the Waukmill Bay, where by 
unloading a part of the cargo, which conflfted chiefly of 
flax, the veffel was got off, without receiving any confider-

able damage ; upon which occafion, much to the honour of 
the inhabitants, every afiiftance was given, and not a fingle 
head of flax amiffing. 

Hills. — The principal hill in this parifli is about 700 
feet high. It is called the Wart Hill, as is erroneoufly fup- 
pofed, from a fmall hillock raifed on the top of it by Mr 
Murdoch Mackenzie, when he furveyedjthefe iflands. This 
gentleman, who is ftill alive, is a native of Orkney ; and 
the firft who brought furveying to that degree of accuracy 
which it has of late attained. Sir Robert Strange, the late 
famous engraver, was alfo a native of this country ; and, 
as he told the prefent incumbent, palled fome of the hap- 
picft days of his youth in this parifli ; which, after all his 
travels through France and Italy, he could not help ad- 
miring for the natural beauty of its fcenery. Such is the 
fweet remembrance of youth ! And yet this partiality is 
not altogether without foundation. For from the top of 
a hill, at the foot of which, on a riling ground, Hands the 
manfe of Orphir, are to be feen, at one view, 25 iflands 
and 23 parilh.es, including mod of the Orkney iflands, and 
part of the ifland of Great Britain, with an extenfive view 
of the Atlantic and Germanic Oceans, together with that 
truly fublime objecl:, the ftupenduous mountain of Hoy, 
warned on one fide by the Pentland Firth, and on the other 
by the Orkney Mediterranean, which is as beautiful a piece 
of water as any county in Scotland can boaft of, and much 
frequented by lhipping. The Lord Advocate of Scotland, 
Upon a late vifit to thefe iflands, arriving at this enchanted 
fpot, from whence he firft beheld the Atlantic Ocean, is 
faid to have exclaimed with ecftacy, " Happy is the cler- 
* gyman who inhabits yonder manfion!" " And ftil! 
ft happier would he be," faid the clergyman, " would his 
«1 Lordftiip help him to an augmentation of ftipend." For 

without 



af Orphic 



without thee, fweet Competence I great Nature argues all 
in vain ; and all is Chaos dark again. 

In former times, when thefe iflands were infefted by pi- 
rates, fires were kindled on the tops of the higheft hills, and 
ferved to give warning to the inhabitants of the number 
and approach of the enemy ; and as the people appointed 
to attend thofe light-houfes were to oblerve and repeat the 
fignals, from the fmaller hills and headlands near the coaft, 
thence, from the Norfe word, Warder, to watch, or look 
out, they got the name of Ward, or Wart Hills ; for this 
appellation is not peculiar to Orkney, but is to be found in 
other parts of Scotland, where the Norwegians refided. 

Mr Hume, the hiftorian, in his account of the Marquis 
of Montrofe's expedition, is pleafed to call the Orkney 
men, an un warlike race of men *. But, had he confulted the 
Icelandick hiftorians, he would have learned, that " of old, 
in thefe iflands, when the trumpet founded to battle, when 
the fhell of war was heard through the land, when the fig- 
nal fires were kindled on the hills, in an inftant the young 
men of Orkney flew to arms, and affembled round their 
chiefs, determined to conquer or die. Their wives and 
their parents, inftead of keeping them back from the com- 
bat, helped them on with their armour, and prepared them 
for the battle." — Thofe who diftinguiihed themfelves by 
their valour, were rewarded at their return with the fmiles 
and the charms of the fair ; — of the fair maids of Orkney ! 
for Orkney has always been diftinguifhed for beautiful wo- 
men. Then no woman of beauty, of family, of fortune, of 
of virtue, would deign to give her hand to the youth who 
had either declined or fled from the combat. For well 
they knew, that None but the brave deferve the fair. Such, 
of old, were the men of Orkney, and the ladies too, what- 
ever information Mr Hume may have received to the con- 
trary*

trarj. And for the hardinefs and bravery of the feamen of 
the prefent day, about 2000 of whom have ftept forward to 
ferve their country, in almoft every war fince the Hanove- 
rian fucceflion, his Royal Highnefs Prince William, the fon 
of our gracious Sovereign, can vouch. 

FoJJUs. — There are here a few flates, of an inferior qua- 
lity, and fome excellent flags. Abundance of iron ore is 
found lying on the furface of the ground, but no attempt 
has been made to dig up any. Blue ftone, fit for building, 
and alfo freeftone, are to be had in great abundance. There 
is a curious vein of the latter fort in Houton-head, adjacent 
to the fea, of about 20 feet in height, and 100, or upwards 
in breadth, and confifting of a variety of colours, fome 
white, fome yellow, fome green, and fome of a jet black, 
and fometimes of all of thefe colours beautifully blended 
together. A fmall fragment of this rock was lately pre- 
sented to an eminent feal-cutter in Edinburgh, who pro- 
nounced it to be very valuable, and admirably adapted for 
finilhing fide boards, or the ornamental parts of chimneys, 
provided it could be found hard enough to admit of a po- 
lilh. For the fample prefented to him, as well as all the 
outward furface of this vein, is fo foft and brittle, as to yield 
to the flighted imprelfion : But, if quarrymen were em- 
ployed to penetrate the rock to a fufficient depth, it might 
be difcovered to be adapted for many of the purpofes t» 
which the fineft marble is applied. 

Some coal-fione, iiich as is met with near the furface of 
coal-mines, has been difcovered, among the rocks of Wauk- 
mill Bay, the property of Mr Honyman of Grrernfay ; but 
no trial has been made of it. Some very fine white and 
blue clay is dug up, beneath the flood-mark in Snugro 
Bay, commonly ufcd for colouring chimneys and hearth- 
Hones.

Quadrupeds, Birds, Ifc. — All the different forts of qua- 
drupeds and birds, which are to be met with in the other 
parifhes of this country, are alfo to be found here, the bird 
called the lyre excepted, which is peculiar to the high rocks 
of Walls and Hoy, and the Redhead of Eday. It is re- 
marked of the ifland of Cava, and of fome other fmall 
iflands, that neither rat nor moufe will live in them.

Here are no Seceders nor Diflenters of any kind.— 
Three fuicides have been committed within thefe few 
years : One by a young woman, after a long fit of deep 
melancholy, from what caufe is not known ; another by an 
elderly woman, during a lownefs of fpirits, occafioned by a 
lingering fever ; and the third by a young man, in the 
height of a nervous fever. Hanging was the death thofe 
unfortunate perfons made choice of. 

Emigration. — Many young men emigrate from hence 
yearly ; fome as failors on board merchant vefiels, who ge- 
nerally land in the King's feryice at^laft ; although they ab- 
hor the idea of being prefied in their own country. Others, 
and the greateft number, enter into the fervice of the Hud- 
fon's Bay Company; and, inftead of offering an honour- 
able fervice to their King and country, or flaying at home 
to cultivate their lands, and protect their wives, their chil- 
dren, and their parents, for the fum of L. 6 per annum, hire 
themfelves out for flaves in a favage land, where, in the 
language of Scripture, they are literally employed as hew- 
ers of wood and drawers of water ; or, what is a ftill more 
diftinguiftiing badge of flavery, in dragging along large 
loads of timber, yoked in the team, like beafts of burden. 
My God ! Shall man, formed in the image of his Creator, 
defert the human fpecies; and, for the paltry fum of L. 6 
a-year, affume the manners and the habits of the brutes 
that perilh. Fy be on the man, who would rather be the 
flave of a Company of private merchants, than enter into 
the fleets and armies of Great Britain, and bravely fight 
for his King and country, our religion, our liberties, and 
our laws. Many of thofe men, at their return, after 8 or 
io years exile, bring home with them all the vices, with- 
out any of the virtues of favages ; indolence, diflipation, lr- 
religion, and at the fame time a broken conftitution ; and

the misfortune is, that having earned a little money, (for, 
after a five years refidence, their wages are augmented), 
they are enabled to overbid the honeft induftrious farmer, 
who is incumbered with a number of fmall children, and 
who perhaps may have fallen into a temporary arrear, 
upon whom the unfeeling landlord has no compaffion. But, 
behold the confequence ! in a few years, from ignorance 
and want of induftry, the emigrant, in his turn, is alfo re- 
duced to poverty, and muft give way to another of his own 
tribe. By thefe means, moll of the farms are over-rented ; 
and this fluctuating ftate of things puts an effectual bar to all 
improvement, and furely calls aloud for reformation from 
every virtuous landholder. There are at prefent, from this 
parifh alone, in this infernal fettlement, 43 of our prime 
young men ; and 12 more are juft upon the eve of embark- 
ing : This, added to the number of feamen abroad, fcarce 
leaves hands to cultivate the ground, and muft fooner or 
later depopulate the country. By thofe means there are 
no fpare hands for manufactures; and the fifhery, which, 
next to the kelp, ought to be the great ftaple of Orkney 
commerce, is entirely abandoned ; and befides, the King's 
fervice is deprived of many hardy feamen ; for the moment 
war is proclaimed, for fear of being preffed, they Ikulk 
away to this diftant fettlement. At the fame time it muft 
be acknowledged, for the honour of the Hudfon's Bay Com- 
pany, that no men ever acted with more integrity, or ful- 
filled their agreements more honeftly, than thofe gentle- 
men have uniformly done ; and further, upon a reprefenta- 
tion from the prefent incumbent of this parilh, they have 

e wages to L. 10 ; by which 
means above L. icoc Sterling per annum is added to the in- 
come of Orkney. 

Agriculture. 



Statiftical Account 



Agriculture.— There, are employed in tillage 100 Ork- 
ney ploughs, and two Highland ones. The latter were in- 
troduced by Patrick Honyman of Gramfay ; who alfo in* 
clofed his farm with good ftone dikes. It is the common 
Scotch plough, with two ftilts. The former is of a very 
lingular conftruclion, having only one ftilt, a fmall pointed 
fock, with a coulter, refembling a kail gully ; and inftead 
of a mould-board, two Hicks fattened to the head of the 
plough, in a horizontal direction, which, inftead of levelling 
the fward, ferves only to break it into pieces, leaving one 
half of the furface unturned down. This plough, which is 
very light, is drawn by three horfes a-breaft, with the af- 
fiftance of a driver, who goes before, and pulls them on by 
a halter, fattened to the midmoft horfe ; the ploughman 
carries in his right hand a fmall ftick, called a pattle, with 
which he clears the plough ; it alfo ferves him occafionally 
as a fecond ftilt, when he wants to take more earth ; and 
every now and then, when the horfes are lazy, he throws 
it at them, to quicken their pace. The furrow made by 
this plough is feldom above three inches deep, and thrown 
off in a flanting direction. The harrows, which are alfo 
fmall and light, are of an oblong form, and generally with 
wooden teeth, and are drawn fide foremoft: There is a 
horfe and a driver for each harrow. 

The only crop6 raifed here are fmall black oats, fown in 
April; and bear, or big, fown in May. The harveft ge- 
nerally begins about the end of Auguft, and is over about 
the middle of Oftober. A few potatoes are cultivated 
upon every farm. There is plenty of bog-hay ; and, of 
late, attempts have been made to introduce clover and rye- 
grafs ; but nothing can be done in this way, without fuffi- 
cient inclofures. 

The manure chiefly made ufe of is dung from the cattle, 
mixed up with alhes and turf, and fometimes a little fea- 

ware.

ware. Very good marl has been difcovered, but little ufo 
has been made of it. There can hardly be faid to be any 
rotation of crops, the fame fields having been fown, for 
time immemorial, with bear and oats alternately, and fel- 
lom yield above 3 or 4 of increafe. The grain of this pa- 
rim is efteemed to be of a fuperior quality, and the beft 
malt in Orkney is made here. The bear raifed from fea- 
ware is obferved to be hulky, and fmall bodied. Peafe 
thrive very well ; but, except a few for the table, little at- 
tention is paid to them. Cabbages and garden roots grow 
in great perfedion ; and perhaps the fineft and largeft arti- 
chokes in the world are to be found in this country, in the 
common kail-yards, fpringing up amongft the grafs with- 
out any cultivation. 

Woods.— -There are a few currant or berry bufhes, and a 
few apple trees, trained up along the garden-walls ; but no 
foreft trees ever have been, or perhaps ever will be, raifec? 
in this country. The atmofphere is evidently too much 
impregnated with falt-water ; for, in ftormy weather, the 
fea-fpray flies over the whole country, and frequently ruins 
the crop, particularly if it happens in the firft of Auguft, 
before the corn is greenful. There are a few natural hazles,' 
mountain-am, and willows, in one of the vallies of the hill 
•f Hoy ; and although thefe, owing to the winding of the 
valley, and the height of the furrounding hills, are remark- 
ably well Iheltercd, yet they do not exceed 12 or 14 feet 
in height. A great many roots of fmall trees, feemingly 
fuch as thefe, are alfo dug up in feveral peat-moffes ; but it 
does not appear that there have ever been trees of any foe 
in this country ; and this fadt is incontrovertibly eftablifhed 
by the Icelandick hiftorians, who relate, that Einar, Earl

William Honyman of Graemfay, the principal heritor of 
this parifh, lately planted feveral thoufand trees of different 
kinda, but without effect. The prefent incumbent has alfo 
planted a good many of different forts and fizes, but they no 
fooner get above the wall, than they are immediately blaft- 
ed. A. few afh trees were lately cut down in the Bifliop's 
garden at Kirkwall ; which, in the fpace of 200 years, had 
grown to the height of between 30 and 40 feet ; and even 
thefe were protected by houfes of equal height. Indeed, 
Orkney is not lingular in this particular. We find the fame 
caufes produce the fame effecls in other fituations fimilar to 
theirs, viz- in Caithnefs, Buchannefs, and in all promonto- 
ries, where the fea-air predominates. 

Sheep. — In the hills and dales of Orphir, there is fuffi- 
cient pafture for 3000 or 4000 (beep ; and yet the whole 
number does not exceed 400, owing chiefly to the prefent 
want of police in the country. For, previous to the 1748, 
when the heritable jurifdiftions were abolifhed, there were 
bailies in every pariih, who decided in fmall matters with- 
in their bounds ; and were particularly attentive to the re- 
gulations relating to the folding, fhearing, and marking of 
flieep. Then no one was permitted to take a fheep upon 
any pretence, without the prefence of at leaft two fponfi- 
ble witneffes, called Lawrightroen. But of late, fince thefe 
offices have been abolifhed, every one goes to the hill when 
he pleafes, and either marks and fhears them without any 
witnefs, or-difpofes of them as he thinks proper ; by which 
means thieves abound, and the real proprietors are defraud- 
ed ; and as thefe poor animals are neither houfed nor herded, 
many of them periffa of cold, and many are worried by 
docs. Such is our fituation with regard to this nioft ufe-

ful animal ; chiefly owing to the above caufes, and partly 
to the ill judged preference given to the hnen-manufa&amp;ure, 
in a country where it can never become a ftaple commo- 
dity. 

Number of Acres. — There is no map of the parifli ; but 
as the ploughgangs are much of a fize, e.ich containing 
about 8 acres of arable ground at an average, and the paf- 
ture confifting of about double that number ; and as 3 crofts 
may equal a ploughgoing, then 1 17x8=936 acres of arable, 
and 936X2=1872 acres of pafture ; and the whole parifli 
being computed to contain 20 fquare miles, or 12800 acres, 
then there remain for moffes, braiks, lakes, and hill-pafture, 
9992 acres. The arable being to the whole furface as 1 
to 13! ; and both arable and pafture as 1 to 4$ ; and to the 
wafte land as 1 to 31 nearly. 

Language, and Names of Places. — The language fpoken 
here is much the fame as in the fouth of Scotland, andftran- 
gers remark, with lefs of a provincial accent. The ancient 
names of places are derived from the Norwegian, fuch as 
Tufkibifter, the land of Tulkermen ; Kirbifter, Kirkland ; 
Houton and Hobbifter, Highland; Swambifter, the land of 
Sueno; Orphir, the land of Fire; and Claiftran, Clofe 
Town, from being the weftermoft extremity of the parifli, 
and like a mill cloufe, clofing or fliutting up the fame. It 
is fomething remarkable, that the weftern extremity of the 
neighbouring parilh has a fimilar name, vis. Cloufton, as if 
the original meafurer of thefe pariflies, in laying out their 
different diftrias, had proceeded from E. to W. from a fu- 
perftitious refpeft to the fun's courfe. There are many 
other local names, evidently of fimilar origin ; fuch as, 
Voenefs, a headland dividing two fmall bays ; Heildibrae, 
a place where bonefires ufed to be kindled, from the Ice- 

landick

landick word heild, fignifying fire ; Konger's-knbw, a tu-' 
mulus near the road leading to the King's-ferry. But from 
what circumftance the Mainland came to be honoured 
with the name of Pomona, is difficult now to account for ; 
unlefs its origin be afcribed to an opinion which prevailed 
among the ancients, that Thule was a terreftrial paradife, 
referabling the garden of the Hefperides. Orkney may 
have received its name from the Saxons, its ancient inha- 
bitants, who had emigrated from the Hercynian foreft, 
which, Caefar tells us, Grceci appellant Orcy7iiam y and of 
which Saxony formed a part. 

The ancient proprietors of this pai ifh were the Halcros, 
the Sinclairs, and the Stewarts. The only considerable 
proprietor at prefent is William Honyman, Efq; of Giaem- 
fay, a gentleman poffeffed of the largcft property in this 
county, next to Lord Dundas, and lineally defcended from 
Andrew Honyman, Bifhop of Orkney, whom he has the 
honour to reprefent. Keith, in his Catalogue of the Bi- 
fhops, p. 136. tells us, that Andrew Honyman, Archdeacon 
of St Andrews, author of the Seasonable Cafe and Survey 
of Naphtali, fucceeded Bifhop Sydferf, anno 1664, to the 
fee of Orkney, in the month of July 1668. This prelate 
received, on the llreet of Edinburgh, by one Mitchell, who 
had been at the riling into rebellion at Pentland Hills, afhot 
in his arm, with a poifoned bullet, as he was fteping into 
the Arch bifhop of St Andrew's (Dr Sharp) coach, for 
whom the {hot was intended. He found his health much 
impaired after this difafter. He died in February 1676, 
and was buried in the Cathedral Church of Kirkwall. He 
was a man of Angular piety, and great abilities, 

Hill-dike.— -The towns or diftrias of this parifii are each

Hill-dike; the whole burden of keeping which in repair,

very improperly falls upon thofe whofe farms are contigu- 
ous to it, the reft giving themfelves no concern -, by which 
means it is poorly kept up indeed. 

Rent. — The valued rent is L. 1632 : 18 : iof Scotch mo- 
ney, the real rent, including the feu duties paid for the 
bifhopric, about L. 500 Sterling, befides L. 150, at an ave- 
rage, for kelp. The value p t r acre of arable land may be 
6 s. 8 d. and of pafture is. 8 d. About ice fathoms of 
peat are fent from hence to the towns of Kirkwall and 
Stromnefs yearly, valued at L. 1, 8 s. per fathom ; one half 
of thefe is paid in rent ; the remainder, though purchafed 
with great labour, both of horfes and people, is a fure fund 
to the inhabitants, as their molfes are inexhaudible. 

Weights and Meafures. — The falfe weights and meafures 
of this country have long been a fource of grievance and 
complaint; and in no inftance is the oppreffion more gla- 
ring than in the meafure of peats paid here by the tenants, 
under the denomination of a fathom. This was origi- 
nally a cube of 6 feet fquare, containing 216 folid feet; 
and will it be believed by the generous and free-born Eng- 
lifhman, that, in a feries of years, this meafure has been 
gradually increafed upon the ignorant and unfufpecling in- 
habitant, by his inhuman landlord, from 216 to 1008 folid 
feet ! for the prefent fathom in this parifti meafures no lefe 
than 12 feet fquare by 7 feet high. 

The other weights and meafures of this country, which 
are of Danilh origin, have been alfo increafed in the fame 
proportion, whether by the landholder, or fuperior of the 
feu-duties, or by both in concert, is now uncertain; but 
whoever were the tranfadors of this infamons bufinefs, if 
the cries of an oppreffed people ever reach the Throne of 
Mercy, they have by this time received their juft reward.

Statijlical Account 



To Lord Dundas, who is the prefent fupeiior, and who is 
juflly efteemed to be one of the beft gentlemen in England, 
no blame whatever can attach; his family purchafed the 
eftate long after the date of thofe grievances ; and, fo far 
from meriting the flighteft charge of oppreffion, his Lord- 
Hup, in a year of uncommon fcarcity, upon receiving a lilt 
of thofe grievances, readily offered to accept of the lowed; 
con ver lion the proprietors would name, provided the fame 
benefit were communicated to their fubtenants : And, fy 
be on the man who rejected the equitable and humane 
propofal. 

On the Orkney weight, called the punlar, 24 merks 
make 1 fetting — 32 lb. Dutch, and 6 fettings make 

1 mielmii ftone ditto. This inflrumentis upon the fame 
principle as the Roman fteelyaid, but may be very eafily 

falfified ; for, by making the fmalleft alteration on the 

fliort arm, to which the weight is appended, the receipt 
may be confiderably increafed or diminiflied ; and either 

the payer or receiver greatly injured. A miftaken notion, 
however, prevails in this country : That, fuppoling this in- 
ftrument to be correctly adjutted, and that the weigher were 
an honeft perfon, yet ftill this mode of payment is in favour 
of the receiver. But the cafe is quite the reverfe ; for after 
an exa&amp; furvey of the punlar, upon median cal principles, it 
will be found, that for every ftone weight above two, the 
receiver fuftains a lofs of 21 lb. Dutch. To make this un- 
derftood, it will be ueceilary to explain, that the punlar is a 
lever of 6 feet long, divided, by notches, into 12 equal parts, 
of 6 inches each, one of which conftitutes the fliort arm, 
from the extreme end of which projects a plug of iron, of a 
little more than an inch long, and at the end thereof is in- 
ferted a pivot, round which a hook moves, for ridding up 
the weight. The balance, upon the oppolite arm, is a ftone 
of 32 lb. Dutch, appending from a moveable ring, which 

Aides 



of Orphir. 



Aides from notch to notch as the weigher choofes. Now, it 
13 evident, that this addition to the fhort arm muft uimi- 
nifh the weight; and, that in adjufting the lever, the mea- 
fure of the fhort arm ought to be taken from the pivot of 
the hook to the pivot of the center of motion, and not from 
the end of the beam, as is the practice, which makes a 6th 
part of difference. For, if you fuppofe this arm of the le- 
\ r er, which is precifely the cafe, by the one meafurement 
to be 7 inches, and by the other only 6 ; or, dividing the 
fame, in the one cafe, into 28 parts, or quarters of inches, 
and in the other into 24 of thefe quarters ; then, according 
to the mechanical principles of the lever, the weights will 
be inverfely as their diflances, and 24 merks at the hook 
will balance 28 upon the oppofite arm, and there will be a 
lofs to the receiver of 4 merks upon every fetting, or repe- 
tition of the firft error, occahoned by not making the mea- 
fure from notch to notch on the long arm of the lever of 
the proper length, vix. from the centre of the pivot of the 
hook to the centre of the piv ot of the point of motion ; of 
courfe, the lofs to the receiver, upon the miel, will be 20 
merks; upon the 9 fettings, 32 merks; and upon the 12 
fettings, 44 ; being nearly the 7th part of the whole re- 
ceipt. 

To cure this original defect, a very inadequate remedy 
has been applied, vix. the perfon weighing adds x fetting. 
more to the weight, by Aiding forward the ring to which 
the balance is appended half way to the next notch ; for it 
mutt be obferved, that every notch forms a fetting. Of 
old, they have probably had fome ftandard weight .qual to 
the miel ; and, finding the punlar miel to fall fh rt of it, or 
peihaps nottocorrefpond with its confl tuent parts up m the 
bifmar, another Danifli we ght, weighing one fetting, and 
upon nearly the fame principles, they have thought to rec- 
tify the miftake in this imperfect manner, not having been 

able 



416 Statijlical Accqunt 

* '-4* • J 

able to difcover the original error. And this has alfo bee» 
the reafon why, when the weight exceeded 6 or 8 fettings, 
they have given 6 merles of call, or forefeeling, to make 
up the increafing deficiency. This unfortunate miltake for 
the buyer and receiver may be completely rectified, in the 
manner above mentioned, by taking the meafure from pi- 
vot to pivot, and not from the end of the beam, and then 
every fetting will fall upon its proper notch, without going 
beyond it, and there will be no cafl of the beam, or fore- 
feeling, as it is called, neceffary, which is the fource of great 
fraud. 

Church, Stipend, Poor, is'c. — The church, which was re- 
paired 40 years ago, was built in the year 1707, and the 
manfe in 1789. The flipend, including the glebe, may be 
about L. 80 a-year. The patron is Lord Dundas. The 
prefent incumbent was fettled in 1776, and is as yet un- 
married. 

There is a parochial fchool, where from 30 to 40 boys 
and girls are taught reading, writing, and arithmetic. The 
encouragement given to the matter is extremely fmall ; a 
folitary houfe, without fo much as a kail-yard 100 merks 
of falary, and no emoluments whatever; although it is to 
be hoped the heritors will redrefs this grievance, and ap- 
point fchool-wages to be paid. A Society fchool is much 
wanted here ; and until fuch can be obtained, the inhabi- 
tants, poor as they are, make a fhift to employ private 
teachers occafionally at their own expence. 

The condition of the poor is truly lamentable. The 
number upon the roll fometimes exceeds 10 ; and the an- 
nual amount of contributions for their fupport is only L.4 
at an average. Would the non-refiding heritors, who are 
in affluent circumftances, contribute fomething for their re- 
lief 



of Orphir. 



lief, which hitherto they have not done, it would redound 
much to their honour. 

Antiquities. — In the church -yard are the remains of an 
ancient building, called the Girth-houfe, to which great an- 
tiquity is afcribed. It is a rotundo of 18 feet in diameter, 
and 20 feet high ; open at top ; and on the eaft fide is a 
vaulted concavity, where probably the altar flood, with a 
flit in the wall to admit the light ; two-thirds of it have 
been taken down to repair the parilh church. The walls 
are thick, and confift of ftones, ftrongly cemented with 
lime. From its refemblance to the Pantheon, fome have 
afcribed this building to the Romans ; but, in all probabi- 
lity, it has been a Popilh chapel, dedicated by the piety of 
its founder to fome favourite faint. 

In the dittridr. of Swambifter, or Suenobifter, are the 
ruins of an ancient tower, of a circular form, and about 180 
feet in circumference ; and once, probably, the refidence of 
Sueno Boerftrop, who was killed by the famous Sueno 
Afterifas, during a Chriftmas entertainment in this pariih, 
at the houfe of Paul, one of the Norwegian Counts of Ork- 
ney; of which a very particular account is given by the 
Icelandick hiftorian of Saga Orcadenfis. 

In the diftrid of Tuikibifter, at a place called Obah, re- 
fided feveral of the ancient Counts of Orkney ; particularly 
Harold, who was poifoned by his aunt Fraukark, and the 
aforementioned Paul, who was put to death by his own Af- 
ter, the firft Countefsof Athol. The fituation is fo circumflan- 
tially defcribed by the Icelandick hiftorian, as not to admit 
of a doubt j although, except an ancient, chapel and burying 
ground, alluded to by the hiftorian, fcarce a veftige of the 
ruin remains. Romifti chapels are to be met with in every 
diftnft of the parifh ; alfo a great many barrows or tumuli ; 
but none of them have been opened.

Commerce. — The principal article of commerce is kelp, 
which at prefent fells as high as L. \o per ton. The only 
other articles worth mentioning are, malt, black cattle, 
grenie, butter, and linen-yarn ; for which fo poor a price 
is given by the dealers in that commodity, that the moil ex- 
pert fpinner can hardly earn 2 d. a-day. 

No country in North Britain is better fituated for trade 
than this, and yet nowhere has it been more neglected. 
This is chiefly owing to a low fpirit for fmuggling, which 
has been, the bane of Orkney for half a century paft; and, 
befules perjury, been the introduction of almofl every fpe- 
cies of meannefs and of vice which can degrade the human 
character. The writer of the prefent report, when a very 
young man, infpired with the love of his country, and fired 
ivith indignation at this unhallowed trade, in which, as in 
a vortex, truth, honour, integrity, and every virtue, was 
fwallowed up, refolved, with the fpirit of an ancient Ro- 
man, to attack the hideous monfier ; and accordingly, de- 
fpifing the mifapplied appellation of Informer, in fo glo- 
rious as well as hazardous an attempt, gave in to the col- 
lector of the cufloms, on the public fftreet, an accufation 
againft a noted fmuggler, had his veffel feized, condemned, 
and burnt; demanded and received the informer's fhare, as 
an inducement to others to follow the example, and imme- 
diately bcftowed the fame in erecting a charity fchool in 
the parifti, whereby they have been fince greatly benefited. 
Although it muft be confeffed, that, in this bufinefs, he was 
privately fupported by fome of the firft gentlemen in Ork- 
ney ; whofe reprefentatives, much to their honour, and for 
.the good of their country, have fince completed the bufi- 
nefs:, and it is to be hoped, lefs from political motives, than 
from moral and patriotic principles.

By the Rev. Mr John Cook, Mhiijier.</head> 



<p>Na?ne, Itfc. 

THE parifh of Kilmany has the fame name with that 
by which the moll confiderable village it pofleffes is 
diftinguifhed. From a fmall burying-ground * which fur- 
rounds the church, the name has probably been derived. 

This village, which the name, the number of people it 
contains, and the vicinity of the church, diftinguifh above 
every other in the parifh, is about 5 miles diftant from 

Cupar, 

* Kilmany is, according to common opinion, of Celtic origin. If only 
that part of the word which fignifies a burying-ground be Celtic, it will not 
be a Angular inftance of fuch compofition in our mixed language The 
other villages in the parifh have,' in general, either names defcriptive of their 
fituation, or thofe of former poffeffors.

Cupar, the county town, and the feat of the prefbytery. It 
is fcattered along the lhallow and narrow water of Mo- 
tray *, which unites, in the . weftern extremity of the parifli, 
two fmall ftreams, ilfuing from different fides of Norman's 
Law, and which, after a fhort and gentle courfe, falls into 
the river Eden, not far from the bay of St Andrew's. 
A. little attention to the pleafing irregularities in the ground 
on which Kilmany is fituated, and through which the rivu- 
let flows, might have made it a beautiful pidlure of rural 
fcenery. But how feldom has fuch attention either chofen 
the fituations, or arranged the forms, of the largeft towns! 
Accident, or the idea of conveniency, which can feldom be 
hurt by a regard to beauty, is allowed to have in thefe mat- 
ters too powerful an influence ; and in the pofition of the 
ftraggling huts of this village, as in that of many other 
places, we have to lament the careleffnefs which can build 
in a beautiful place of refidence, and yet neglecl to take 
advantage of the aids which the fcenery at once furnifhes 
and fuggefts, to decorate the dwellings of men, and from 
thefe thus decorated, to derive ornaments in addition to its 
own. 

The church f Hands on a beautiful tank, riling gradually 
from the ftream, which flows part it on the S. ; is fkirted on 
the W. by fome tall allies ; and fronts the hill of Forrit, 
once covered with firs, but now ftript of the whole. No

much retained. It feems ftrange, that there mould have been lb prevalent

from W. to E. about 6 Etiglilh miles, chiefly in that fer- 
tile traft of country, which runs almoft without interrup- 
tion, from the barren plain betwixt the mouths of the 
Eden and the Tay, to the town of Newburgh and Loch 
Lindores. Where the valley is confined, the parifh is 
fcarcely a mile in breadth ; but to the W. beyond the vil- 
lage of Rathillet, it widens with the valley, rifes on each 
hand over the adjacent heights, and gains an extent of about 
four miles. The greateft part of the parifh, however, is 
contained between one continued branch of the Ochil moun- 
tains, and fome hills, of different fizes, and of various forms, 
which are fcattered to the S. 

Kilmany is diftant from the river Tay, and from the 
port of Balmerino, about 3 Englifh miles ; but is feparated 
from them by the branch of the Ochil Hills which ftretcbes 
along the N. ot Fife, and gradually diminishes in fize, till 
it moots down into the river near Scot's-craig. 

Wood and Scenery-— This range of hilly ground, which 
diverfifies in the moft linking manner the fouthern more 
of the Tay, which in fome places fwells in full unbroken 
maffes, with variegated colouring, in others, raifes fud- 
denly upwards rugged fragments of uncovered rock, might, 
were the hand of improvement to perform its office, make 
this part of Fife a fcene of the moft 'luxuriant beauty. 
There are brows on thefe hills which the plough cannot 
reach, or where its labour would not be rewarded } which 
equally by their fituation and their foil are fitted to rear 
timber. This is fo obvioufiy the only ufe to which they 
can be put, that the traveller who takes time to look around

him, mull lament the nakednefs they difplay. He will la- 
ment it the more in a fcene, where the hand of nature, and 
the toils of the hufbandman, have done fo much to admini- 
fter to his delight ; where the contrail: of broken rocks and. 
fwelling hills, with plains in the richer! cultivation; and 
where the cultivation, breaking with irregular fteps the 
bleaknefs of the hills, fometimes left at their bafe, fome- 
times climbing on their fides, concur to form an exquifitely 
varied landfcape. How much would it add to the fcene, 
were the rich corn fields to rife into the bofom of woods 
ftretching with various length down towards the plain ; 
■were fome of the bareft fummits to efcape above their 
verdure ; and were the beautiful waters of the Tay feen 
through openings made thus pi&amp;urefque ? 

Neither would fuch exertions in improving the country 
be unprofitable; nor is the idea of making them vifionary. 
Independently of the value of the wood, (and it is well 
known how foon it does become valuable), it tends, by 
affording a warm fhelcer, to meliorate the adjacent land in 
a ftate of tillage. From every appearance it is alfo pro- 
bable that the foil, which cannot be ploughed, might bear 
a rich covering of wood. From experience, indeed, little 
can be faid, for the parifh can boaft of few attempts to plant 
trees; but where fagacity and tafte have made the attempt, 
and continued the fmall attention neceffary for fuccefs, they 
have been in general re warded with a confiderable recompenfe 
for the labour, and a rich addition to the beauty of the fur 
rounding fcene. The hill of Forrir, in the parifh of Logic, 
was, till fome years ago, covered with firs; 21 acres on "the 
eflate of Lochmalony, bear them in great perfection, and 
we may fee them fcaling fome of the fteepeft hills in the 
neighbourhood*. In as far, indeed, as the beauty of the 

country

country is concerned, it would be rather defirable that in 
fome fpots they ihould fail entirely. The irregularity thus 
produced, the wandering inartificial line in which the foli- 
age would then appear, would give an eafe to the fcenery, 
which the formal fquares and circles, ufed with fuch partia- 
lity by cuftom to bound plantations, effectually deftroy. 

Even were the trees not to rife to a great height, the 
proprietor, though he could not be otherwife enriched by 
them, would be indebted to the fhelter they afforded to his 
arable lands ; and the country would wear almoft as rich an 
afpecT:, with its hills thus covered, as if they were crowned 
with lofty wood. On a rugged country this is peculiarly 
beautiful. A little diftance always gives a fine effect, even 
to the pooreft plantations ; the fhortnefs of the wood the 
eye cannot then accurately meafure ; while, at the fame 
time, the foliage feems deep, and the boldnefs of the 
ground towers above its (hade. 

Antiquities.— -No ruins of any abbey or chapel, not even 
the fragments of any remarkable building, give folemnity 
to the fcenery of the parifh. A few pretty large ftones, 
funk in the top of one of its hills, have excited curiofity ; 
and the genius of antiquarianifm, unaided by the informa- 
tion which the country can afford, would probably find in 
them the remnant of fome camp or caftle. The lefs fplen- 
did, but the more juft account of the inhabitants, makes 
them part of fome common decayed fence. 

Scarcely a mile to the N. of Kilmany, there is a romantic 
rocky den, cut deep in the face of the mountain. It has 
probably been gradually worn down by the fucceffive tor- 
rents, which the heavy rains in winter throw from the 

higher 

intheparifli, and its neighbourhood; and if the exertions are vigoroufly 
continued, in to years' the face of this part of the country will be completely 
clunged.

higher ground, dafhing amongft its rocks. The name it 
has received in the country is, Goule's Den. By thofe who 
live near it, no explanation of the name is given. The 
manner in which it is written here would lead any one, ac- 
quainted with the Arabian Nights Entertainments, to ima- 
gine, that fuperftitious terrors had peopled it with the de- 
ftroying demons mentioned in one of thefe {lories. The 
facl is, that difmal reports, of what had been feen and heard 
there, were in other days circulated ; reports which have had 
often lels to gain them credit, than the difmal gloom which 
the (hades of night mull draw over that rugged unfrequent- 
ed fcene. 

Number" of Acres, and Nature of the Soil. — The irregular 
extent of the lands in the parifli, already mentioned, in- 
cludes, (befides a glebe of 9), 3963 Scotch acres. Of thefe, 
the foil differs according to their local fituation. In fome 
of the acres, which are fartheft fouth, the foil is a ftrong 
clay ; in thofe forming the flat banks of the Motray, which 
runs through the whole length of the parifli, the foil is a 
rich black loam, continued beneath the furface, beyond the 
reach of the plough ; in thofe which are extended on the 
gentle acclivities, it is loam, with a gravelly and fometimes 
a rocky bottom ; and in the reft, the ground is cold moor, 
on fome fpots covered with furze *. 

Agriculture*— K very great proportion of the lands in 
the parifli is in a ftate of high cultivation.— Of 3963 acres, 
3216 are arable, the moft of which commonly produce good 
crops. In raifing thefe crops, there is no particular rotation 
Vo1 ' XIX « 3 H uniformly

fell, which carries broom to the height of 6 or 8 feet; a produce of very 
great beauty, and of fome utility as fuel, but which takes fuch pcffdfion of 
the ground, that to extirpate it is a very difficult talk.

Statiflical Account 



uniformly obferved throughout the pariin ; but the one moll 
approved, is that which the ingenious Lord Kames has re- 
commended. The arable land is laboured by 55 ploughs, 
drawn each by two horfes, which are driven by the plough- 
man. Though the ufe of cattle in tilling the ground, and 
even in dragging carriages, be entirely exploded here, it 
may be computed that 139 are raifed annually within the 
parilh, and fold when from betwixt 3 to 4 years old. There 
are no more horfes bred than what are necefiary for the 
purpofes of hufbandry, and for preventing the places of thofe 
which fail from being fupplied out of the public markets *. 

Of the land which at prefent lies wafte, a considerable 
extent may be brought into a ftate of cultivation. The 
meadows, in particular, on the banks of the Motray, and 
which the water often overflows, might be made the raoft 
productive ground in the parilh. Activity has already 
converted a part of thefe into the moft luxuriant corn-fields ; 
but to the improvement of the whole an obftacle is oppo- 
fed, which perhaps may not fpeedily be removed. The 
water of Motray turns four mills in its courfe through the 
parilh. The accumulation of water which hence muft be 
made at each, renders it impoffible to drain the meadows fo 
thoroughly as otherwife might be done ; and the proprie- 
tors of thefe mills have not as yet been difpofed to give up 
for any equivalent the privilege they poflefs. This privi- 
lege was undoubtedly acquired, when ignorance of agricul- 
ture fuppofed thefe meadows to be ufelefs ; but notwith- 
ftanding this ignorance of the nature of the compact, it was 
fairly acquired, and the enjoyment of it has now become a 
right. Though it would be abfurd to think that it might 
be facrificed to benevolence, it would not be unnatural to 
expect;, that for a proper equivalent it would be yielded to 
promote the public good. But the proprietors of thefe 

mills

mills have a much weightier reafon, in the eftimation of the 
world, to induce them to make fuch a conceffion. Their 
own intereft, independently of all equivalent given them, 
would be thus advanced, for the removal of the mills # 
would make way for the improvement both of the mea- 
dows of their neighbours, and of thofe which belong to 
themfelves. Till this change take place, the rich meadows 
will be overflowed with water, and the country denied the 
corn which in great abundance they would produce +. 

Wood. — Of all the ground which might be planted with 
wood, only about 74 acres bear trees grown to a vifible 
lize. Except a few allies, which clufter in the villages, or 
run out in hedge-rows ; and fome trees of different kinds, 
which are fcattered round the family-feats, on the grounds 
of Rathillet, Lochmalony, and Mountwhannie, the planta- 
tions have, chequered with two or three ftraggling birches,

* Thefe four mills, one of which is ufed for drefiing flax, are all that re- 
main in die parilh of a much greater number. The fmall decreale in the 
confumption of oats, peafe, and barley, (they were corn-mills), can hardly 
be conlldered a reafon of this diminution. A better will be found in the 
fuperior fize and mechanifm of thofe that remain. Thirlage, a fpecies of 
monopoly, which, like all others that are privileged, arofe from a fear, that 
can exift only in the infancy of the arts, impofes here no heavier burden on 
the farmer, than- to make him grind the com ufed in his family at the 
nearelt mill. 

f In eftimating the improvements in agriculture, which have been made 
within the parifli, it will not be fafe to follow as a guide the increafe of 
cultivated land. This increafe has by no means correfponded to the fupe- 
rior order into which greater (kill in huibandry has brought fields which 
have been long under the plough ; and unlefs the quantity of grain now 
raifed could be compared with what was raifed formerly, a comparifon 
which cannot be made, it will not be known what have been the improve- 
ments to agriculture, nor what praife the farmers defcrvs. The amazing 
fife of rents may be fome rule of judging.

the deep gloom of the Scotch, or the gayer verdure of the 
larch-fir. The fmall proportion of wooded ground, in com- 
parifon of what may be wooded, has been in part removed 
by confiderable plantations lately made on the eftates of 
Lochmalony, Mountwhannie, and Myre Cairnie ; and it is 
to be hoped, that a few years will fill the melancholy blank, 
which the eye, in wandering over this parifh *, finds upon 
its mountains. 

Tithes. — The tithes of the parifti, with the right of pre- 
fentation to the living, were given to the College of St Sal- 
vator, in the Univerfity of St Andrews, by Bifliop Kennedy, 
the founder of that college. They were intended to be a 
valuable donation ; and would have' been fo in a high de- 
gree, from a parifh in fuch a Hate of cultivation, had they 
been allowed to keep pace with the progrefs of agriculture 
and the price of corn. This was not allowed ; and they 
have now fhrunk out of all proportion to the real rent. The 
Principal and Profeffors of the United College, fince the 
union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's, have received them, 
and are titulars of the tithes, and patrons of the parifh. 

Fuel, l£c. — In the ordinary articles confumed for the 
fupport, or for the comfort of life, the inhabitants of this 
parifh may be abundantly fupplied. But the fupply cannot 
be procured at low prices. Coals, in particular, muft both 
be purchafed at a high rate, and brought into the parifh by 
tedious or difficult roads. In the county of Fife, no coal 
pits have as yet been opened to the north of the river Eden -, 
hence no coals of any kind can be brought hither over land 
by a fhorter road than fix miles, and none good by one lefs 
than 1 6 • and it is no eafy matter to convey them from the

Tay, by the rugged road which croffes the fteep hills fepa- 
rating Balmerino from Kilmany *. From the vicinity of 
the parifh to the towns of Cupar and Dundee, it feels the 
price of fuch provifions as the country produces in abun- 
dance, affected by the conftant demand of thefe large mar- 
kets. Hence cheefe, butter, fowls, eggs, are bought at a 
higher price at Kilmany, becaufe, from the progrefs of 
luxury, they are fought with greater avidity than beef or 
mutton, and from the wealth of the inhabitants, are pur- 
chafed at an enormous rate at Dundee. Out of the mar- 
kets of the towns juft mentioned, thofe who do not kill their 
own meat are fupplied. It was once eafy to bring, at all 
hours, fuch fupplies to Kilmany ; for the high road betwixt 
Cupar and Dundee run through the village. Some years 
ago, (for it is but of late that Fife can boaft of having a 
turnpike-road), the courfe of this road was turned eaftwards, 
three miles from Kilmany. The public profited by the 
change, for they travel by a fmooth inftead of a hilly road ; 
but the village fuffered ; for it no longer enjoys the wonted 
frequent opportunities of conveyance betwixt Cupar and 
Dundee. 

Population. — The parilh is the refidence of hulbandmen. 
Agriculture is the univerfal employment ; it is the fource 
and the fubftance of its few commercial tranfaclions. It 
gives fubfiftence to almoft every individual in the parifli ; 
to the farmers, to their fervants, to the families of thefe 
fervants, who are the great body of inhabitants ; and to the 
few mechanics, whofe offices are neceflary for carrying on

country affairs, or for promoting the comforts of life*. 
From the occupations of the inhabitants, it is evident that 
they cannot be numerous. Agriculture, however capable 
of affording the means of fubfiftence, never collects within 
the fame bounds fuch numbers, as do the various branches 
of manufactures cultivated throughout the ifland. Fewer 
hands can conduct its operations. One great object, too, 
which in its prefent ftate it feems to have in view, is to take 
from thefe hands as many as poffible. In many places, pro- 
prietor and tenant have united to accomplifti this object. 
To have a large and eafily collected rent is naturally defired 
by the former, and this has effefted the annihilation of the 
little tenants fcattered over the country ; to fave as many 
fervants as poffible in the management of country affairs, 
the latter has imagined it to be important economy, and 
this has often fubftituted unmarried men in the place of nu- 
merous families. The healthieft and the pureft nurfery, of 
the molt vigorous and innocent clafs of our countrymen, ha3 
hence been much depopulated. However true it may ap- 
pear, that a numerous clafs of tenantry are incapable of 
keeping the ground in order, or of paying the proper rent, 
there are bounds, beyond which the idea muft prove fatal 
to the country in which it is put in practice ; and it is evi- 
dently full of danger, whatever elfe it be, to turn away the 
cottagers who have been wont to refide on a farm. The 
natural confluences are, that fervants of that kind are

* There is no baker in the parifli. The greateft part of the bread con- 
fumed is prepared by the families who eat it. Theincreafe in the confump- 
tion of wheaten bread has of late been confiderable, but that it bears no 
proportion to the ufe made of oaten and peafe meal in baking bread, is ap- 
parent, from the circuraftance of the parifli having no baker of its own. 
May it not be inferred from thence, that in times of fcarcity it is no alle- 
viation to the wants of the poor, when the rich give up the ufe of flour. 
The cafe is different in large towns. There is no flour preferred hy bakery 
nor barley by brewers, to that which this parifli raifes.

fcarce, and their wages great ; and that a corn country de- 
pends upon foreign aid for cutting down its crops. So long 
as this aid can be eafily procured, the helpleflhefs of the fi- 
tuation does not appear ; but it would be feverely felt, were 
any happy change to meliorate the condition of thofe re- 
gions of poverty from whence the aid is derived. 

There is no fuch dependence in this parifh. Its popula- 
tion, though from the fituation mentioned it cannot be great, 
has not, as far as can be ascertained, diminilhed within the 
laft 20 years. The number in 1755 was 785 *. There are 
now living in the parifh 396 males, and 473 females ; in 
all, 869 f. 

Poor. — The funds of the feffion, for the affiance of the 
poor, are adequate to afford the common fupplies. They 
confift of the intereft of about L. 200 Sterling ; upon which 
capital no encroachment has been found neceffary ; of the 
money paid for the ufe of the mortcloth ; and of the collec- 
tions at the church-door. 

There are in the parilh no ftated poor, who receive week- 
ly from the feffion. More or lefs is given to them, accord-

pure enjoyment •, while the poor lofe not that withdraw-

affiftance. Of both, fuch is the prefent ftate of feelings and 
manners, there are here frequent inftances. The more 
wealthy (for the parifti may be divided into feveral large 
families under -the immediate care of the different farmers) 
take a kindly charge of thofe who live under them, and 
near them, aflifting them very liberally when ficknefs or 
age has unfitted them for their fervice. On the other 
hand, the reluctance, not merely to folicit, but often even 
to receive aid, mews that delicate fenfe of dignity, which 
poverty may fo keenly feel; of which nothing can diveft a 
man but the meannefs of his own foul ; and which is much 
defiderated amongft the lazy, diflipated, importunate beg- 
gars of large towns. 

Religion, 13 c— It cannot be foreign from the object of a 
Statiftical Account to mention the influence which religious 
principle has within the parifh. Notice of individuals is 
often improper and undignified ; a general ftatement of a 
point, which, whatever public opinion or practice may pro- 
nounce, is of infinite confequence to the liability and to 
the happinefs of fociety, no man, whatever the ftatement 
might be, mould be afhamed or afraid to make. It is 
grateful to give a favourable ftatement. Religion will be 
found here to be much more than mere fpeculation it has 
great influence on the conduft; it concurs, withunfeducing 
Lation, to preferve the manners iimple, and to make the 
morals pure-, and it yields fupport in the hour of d.ftrefs.

fophy might be proud to reach. But it is heroifm, arifing 
from a caufe that well accounts for it, in minds which have 
no incitement, from vanity, of the poor defire of impofing 
on the world, to aflume the appearance of fortitude which 
they do not feel. It is the confequence of religion ; of 
their firm belief of a better ftate of exiftence ; and of their 
hope of what a good man will in that ftate enjoy for ever. 
Patriotifm furely cannot wifti for a more fubftantial trea- 
fure to the country, the intereft of whofe inhabitants Ihe is 
defirous to promote, than that the purifying influence of 
true religion mould prevail amongft them ; nor deprecate a 
greater evil, than the petulant prefumptuous licentioufnefs, 
which tolerates no reafonable, no virtuous reftraints, which 
holds thefe up to ridicule, and labours to make them difre- 
garded.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012257">DUNNING</name>, 

(County of Perth, Synod of Perth and Stirling 1 , 
Presbytery of Aughterarder). 

By a Friend to Statijlical Inquiries</head> 



<p>Situation^ Extent, ls?c. 

THE northern extremity of the Ochil Hills, terminat- 
ing in Strathearn, comprehends a very eonfiderable 
proportion of the parifli of Dunning, which is bounded on 
the E. by the parifli of Forteviot } on the W. by Auchter- 
arder ; on the S. by Foffoway ; and on the N. by Gaflc. 
The higher and muirland parts of the parifli are fituated 
among the Ochil Hills, the declivities of which are in fome 
places gentle, and can admit the plough ; but in other pla- 
ces they are fteep and rocky. The high muirs, fome of 
which are at leafy 1000 feet above the level of the fea, are 
occupied in extenfive flieep-walks, which fuffer confider- 
ably by a cold climate, and a greatly expofed fituation. 
The foil, however, in many places, is dry, and carries a 

good 



of Dunning, 



435 



good fward, abounding with excellent pafture-graffes, which 
retain, even in dry feafons, a beautiful verdure. Some 
patches of heath and bent grafs, here and there, interrupt the 
uniformity of the verdure. The foil is generally not deep, 
and is incumbent on whinftone. Thefe high lands remain, 
moftly uninclofed, except by a few dikes of earth or turf, 
that formerly had, in irregular forms, chiefly circular, been 
drawn round fome fmall parcels of ground, once in tillage. 
Thefe fmall inclofures, if they deferve the name, are now 
very properly left in pafture, except one or two adjoining 
to each dwelling-houfe, and which are cropped moftly with 
oats and potatoes. The produce in thefe high fituations is 
extremely fcanty, and the harveft very late. This muir- 
land diftridt is much interfered by deep and very narrow 
glens ; the verdant fides of which afford not only pafture, 
but fometimes an excellent ftielter for ftieep. Large clumps, 
andftripes of trees, are much defiderated in thefe naked and 
expofed places. There is every reafon to believe, that their 
growth would be fo quick as amply to repay any neceffary 
expences. 

Thefe muirs are paftured moftly with the fpeckled-faced 
fheep, chiefly from the ftieep diftrifts, north of Strathearn, 
as Killin, &amp;c. This variety of ftieep is preferred to the 
black-faced Linton breed, for their weight and hardinefs, 
and being fooner ready for the market. Severe colds, and 
long ftorms in winter, are the greateft evils to which ftieep 
are expofed in this high diftrid. 

Agriculture.— -In the lower and arable parts of the parifti, 
confiderabfe improvements have of late been made in agri- 
! culture. Summer-fallow and green crops are introduced 
into every farm ; and a regular fucceffion of crops is gene- 
rally obferved. Some farmers have adopted what is here 
commonly called the Carfe of Gowrie fyftem, which is, 

I* 



43^ Statijiical Account 

I. Oats ; 2. Summer-fallow ; 3. Wheat ; 4. Peafe ; 5. Bar- 
ley, with grafs-feeds ; 6. Hay. In other farms the follow- 
ing rotation is obferved : 1. Oats ; 2. Turnip ; 3. Oats or 
barley, 4. Peafe; 5. Barley with graffes ; 6. Hay, and 
fometimes pafture the feventh year. Potatoes are planted 
generally in fome corner of a field in grain crops. Ten re- 
turn of oats is not an uncommon produce. The turnip 
crop is found to be precarious, but is believed to be very 
ufeful. In fome portions of ground here the oats do not 
degenerate. Thefe may be called permanent foils; and 
wherever found, ought to be chemically analized, that their 
qualities and proportionable mixtures may be afcertained. 
By arriving at this knowledge, farmers will have it the 
more readily in their power to re&amp;ify their foils, and bring 
them to an high degree of perfection. The Cupar-Grange 
or Angus o«ts are moft commonly fown ; and they not un- 
frequently give meal for corn. The rent of land has rifen 
greatly in the fpace of a few years. In general it is atleaft 
doubled fince the year 1770, Some land is let at L. 3 per 
acre, Scotch, yearly, on a leafe of feven years ; a great deal 
is let at 40 s. or two guineas an acre. Top-drefling on the 
fward, for being ploughed up next fpring, is a very com- 
mon pradice. It is a prevailing maxim here, that land 
top dreffed with lime only, or lime and a mixture of earth, 
fhould not be ploughed until the lime has taken a firm grip 
of the ground. Experience has taught, that by this method 
the lime is not only kept from finking too deep, but is alfo 
mixed more intimately with the foil, than were it ploughed 
in immediately after it is laid on the land. This pariih is 
fupplied with four meal, two lint, and three barley mills. 
Mot of the land was formerly thirled to the mills at acon- 
fiderable high multure. But thefe fervitudes were found to 
be real grievances, and therefore were raoftly bought up bj

the tenants, who now, in confequence of this purchafe, may 
carry their grain to be grinded at what mills they pleafe. 

Population.—The population in 1775, according to Dr 
Webfter's account was 1491. It is now about 1600, which 
makes an increafe of 109. 

Church. — The parifh church was anciently the chapel of 
St Serf. It is fituated in the village of Dunning, and is 
well frequented. The Earl of Kinnoul is patron ; and the 
Rev. John Baird is the prefent incumbent. The ftipend 
lately received an augmentation, and amounts to about a 
thoufand merks in money, and four chalders of viftual. 
Belides the parifh church, there are two places of worfhip ; 
the one belonging to the Burgher, and the other to the An- 
tiburgher Seceders. The Prefbyterian Diffenters of the 
Church of Scotland are, by the general report of the re- 
fpettable writers of the Statiftical Hiftory of this country, 
defcribed as being a peaceable arid well-behaved clafs of the 
community This praife-worthy charader is juftly appli- 
cable to both parties of the Seceders in this place and neigh- 
bourhood. 

School. — The parochial fchool, the prefent matter of 
which is Mr Balmain, is very well attendtd. The falary is 
200 merks. The wages, per quarter, for reading Englifh, 
are 18 d. ; for reading and writing, 2 s. ; arithmetic, 2 s. 6 d. 
Latin, 3 s. The Rev. Mr Baird, much to his honour, pays 
particular attention to the ftate of the fchool, efpecially with 
refpett to the mode of teaching, the attendance and beha- 
viour of the fcholars, and the progrefs they make from 
time to time in their education. The proper and regular 
iqflruaion of youth ought to be particularly attended to by 
ajl who have any regard to the good, not only of indivi- 
duals*

duals, but of fociety at large. The fureli part of the foun- 
dation of private and public happinefs is laid in an early 
education, as it is generally conducted in the parochial 
fchools of Scotland. Habits of attention, application, and 
cleanlinefs are acquired ; the faculties of the foul are gra- 
dually enlarged and ftrengthened ; the youth are trained up 
to fill with propriety any ftation of life to which they may 
afterwards be raifed ; and the principles of the Chriftian 
religion, the teaching of which is the moft prominent fea- 
ture of education in parochial fchools, are fo deeply rooted 
in the foul, that they become the means of preferving thou- 
sands from infidelity, and a life of immorality and wretch- 
ednefs. The General Affembly of the Church of Scotland, 
fenfible that the invaluable bleflings of a religious life, and 
the happinefs and permanent fecurity of every well regu- 
lated government, are chiefly founded in the early educa- 
tion of every clafs of the community, have wifely appoint- 
ed a Prefbyterial vifitation and examination, yearly, of all 
the fchools in Scotland. By means of this, no fmall en- 
couragement is given to teachers and fcholars, and the exer- 
tions of both are called forth. From the ftate of the fchool, 
it is prefumed that the youth of the parifh of Dunning will 
be found to make confiderable progrefs in any part of edu- 
cation to which they may apply themfelves, and that their 
after life will be a ftrong proof, that the attention of their 
teacher and minifter to their literary, moral, and religious 
improvement, has not been loft. 

p oor .__About ten paupers are ufually on the poor-lift. 
They are fupported by the weekly collections at the church, 
and the intereft of a fmall fum formerly accumulated. 
Their ufual fupply is from 9 d. to 18 d. a-week each ; but 
upon extraordinary occafions they receive half-a-crown a- 
week. None of them are permitted to beg. The chief 

landed 



of Dunning, 



landed proprietors in this parilh do not commonly attend 
on divine fervice in the parochial church ; fo that (the 
poor here, as in moft other places of Scotland, are fupported 
by the commonality. — Two friendly focieties, or boxes, as 
they are ufually called, are eftabliftied in the parifli, and 
from which the members belonging to them who fall into 
want, receive a ready fupply. One belongs to the weavers, 
and the other to the mafons, in the parilh and neighbour- 
hood. Both are thriving. Part of the ftock is at times laid 
out in purchafing meal, and felling it a little under market 
price to the members of the focieties, and to the poor of the 
parilh. Too much cannot be faid in praife of thefe friendly 
or charitable focieties, as they are conducted in all the ma- 
nufacturing diftrifts in Scotland. 

Villages — The principal village in the parilh is Dunning. 
It confifts of a conliderable number of houfes, many of 
which have been lately built, and are two ftories high; of 
alhlar work, and covered with flate, moftly from Glen- 
Almond, about 20 miles diftant. Some of the houfes are 
elegant and commodious, exhibiting fpecimens of tafte not 
commonly to be met with in country villages. In the im- 
mediate neighbourhood of Dunning is the village of New 
Pitcairn, or Dragon's Den, as it is ufually called. It is but 
of recent origin; and confifts of about thirty tenements or 
dwelling-houfes, all of which, except a very few, contains 
two families, and fome of them four. The ground on 
which this village is built is feued from Mr Graham of 
Orchil. The lots are moftly an hundred ells fquare, for 
which is paid L.i Sterling of purchafe-money, and yd. 
a-year of feu-duty. The houfes here are neat and [clean, 
and are moftly conftrufted for weavers. They are built fof 
a guinea per rood, (mafon's meafure), with fervice, or 20 s. 
without fervice. Freeftone is got every where at hand j not

Unfrequently out of the areas on which the houfes are built* 
Mortar of earth is in many cafes the cement, except for the 
corners and the hewn work. They are, however, cany or 
harletl with lime, both without and within. Houfe-rents, 
equally here with the reft of the parifh, are very low. A 
dwelling-houfe and room, with a four-loom {hop, is let from 
40s. to 50s, a-year; a labourer's houfe, well finifhed, is 
about 25 s. at an average. — The inhabitants of thefe villa- 
ges, and of the moft part of the parifli, are fupplied with 
coal from the coal-works at Blairingone, in the parifh of 
FofToway. The diftance from the village of Dunning about 
12 miles. 

Trade/men. — The only manufacture carried on here is the 
making a few coarfe linens for the Glafgowand Perth mar- 
kets. Weavers in the parifh, 63, about 40 of whom are 

employed in factory work; Wrights, 28; mafons, 27} 
blackfmiths, 4; fhoemakers, 7 ; tailors, 12. The parifh is 
accommodated with eight inns or public houfes, of which 
number fix are in the village of Dunning.— The inhabi- 
tants are not diftinguifhed on account of any peculiarities 
in their drefs, cuftoms, or manners. They are generally of 
an open and communicative difpofition, induftrious in their 
labours, and generous in their intercourfe with fociety. The 
blue bonnet is not altogether out of fafhion in this part of 
the country.— A confiderable quantity of coarfe linen-yarn 
is fpun by the women in the parifh, not a few of whom 
fpin on the two-handed wheel, which a good many years 
ago was introduced from Fife. 

Places of Note.— Duncruib, the property and refidence of 
Lord Rollo, holds a diftinguifhed place in the parifh : " As 
« for the antiquity of this family, John Rollo got a grant 
« of the lands of Duncruib, and other lands, from David 



of Dunning J 441 

** Earl of Strathern, with the confent of King Robert, his 
u father, of the date 13th February 1380. From the lands 
" of Duncruib the family was deligned ; and thefe lands, 
" with others, were ere&amp;ed into a free barony by King 
" James IV. in favours of William Rollo of Duncruib, as 
" the charter bears, of the date 26th October 15 12. From 
" this William was lineally defcended Sir Andrew Rollo of 
" Duncruib, who was knighted by King James VI. and 
" afterwards was by King Charles I. raifed to the dignity 
" of Lord Rollo of Duncruib, in the year 165 1." (Nif- 
Bet's Hera/dry, vol, i. p. 324. 

The houfe of Ke/tze, the property of the Drummonds of 
Keltie, is not of a recent date, and is defervedly far-famed 
for the genuine hofpitality of an open and generous-hearted 
family. 

It is believed by many of the inhabitants of this place, 
that the river Earn was anciently navigable a confiderable 
way above the village of Dunning ; and fome old people 
affirm, that they have feen iron rings fixed in a perpendi- 
cular rock., clofe to the bottom of which the level land of 
the Strath of Earn now comes. It is faid, by tradition in 
the country, that to thefe rings the veflels which navigated 
the river were occafionally faftened. That a great part of 
the haugh or low ground, in the lower diftricl: of this parifti, 
was formerly depofited by the water of the Earn, there can 
be- no doubt ; but that the river was navigable to the above 
mentioned rock is extremely uncertain. 

Terrnave is the moft remarkable fpot in this parifli or 
neighbourhood. It is a hill, or mound of earth, resembling 
a flnp with the keel uppermoft. It occupies many acres of 
ground; is covered with a fine fward of grafs, and ftrikes 
the eye at the diftance of feveral miles. The name is evi- 
dently a corruption of Terror navis; but whether given it

To this place a fuperftitious regard is attached by the vul-

the ground with the fpade, than the form of an o}d man, 
fuppofed to have been the fpirit of the mountain, made its 
appearance from the opening, and with an angry counte- 
nance and tone of voice, aflced the countryman why he was 
tirring (uncovering) his houfe over his head ? On faying 
this, the apparition inllantly difappeared. The man, it is 
reported, was fo terribly frightened, that he immediately 
left off the operation; and none has fince ventured to di-

HpHEparifh of Tondergarth, or Tundergarth, h abou 1 ; 

14 miles iu length, and about i£ miles in breadth. Ic 
comprehends the declivities of a range of hills which lie 
along the river Milk. It is furrounded by the contiguous* 
parifhes of St Mungo's, Dryfefdale, Hottofi, Elkdale -muir, 
Middlebie, and Hoddam. Its furface is, in level, unequal, 
and beautifully diverfified; is in many places green and 
arable, in others, covered with heath', and not yet reduced 
under tillage. It is riot without woods, both natural and 1 
plarited. Some marl pits have been opened in it. 

Population and Employments.— On the 17th of Novem- 
ber 1791, the whole population was found, upon a careful 

enumeration,

Statijlical Accowrt 



enumeration, to amount to 510 fouls. The heritors are in 
number 27. Earl Mansfield is fuperior of the greater part 
of the parifh. Mr Johnltone of Grange, Mr Brown of Weft- 
wood, Mr Richardfon of Piercbyhall, are the principal heri- 
tors ordinarily refident in the parifh. The moft confider- 
able non-refiding heritor is Mr Beattie of Crieve. The in- 
ferior inhabitants are chiefly farmers and farm-labourers. 
Here are, of artifans, 2 blackfmiths, 1 joiner, 1 ftioemaker, 
5 weavers, 2 tailors. The people are in general fober, in- 
duftrious and healthy ; in longevity, fome of them have 
lived to the ages of 84, and even of 90 years. 

Hujbandry. — The hulbandry which occupies the farmers 
is partly that of the fhepherd-life ; in part that of agricul- 
ture. It is the Cheviot breed of fheep which is here culti- 
vated : And of this breed there may be between 3000 and 
4000 Ibeep on the farms in the parifh. The black cattle 
are of a race allied to that of Galloway \ are reared from 
calves not bought in ; and may be in number about 4000. 
The foil is for the moft part gravelly, or of the nature of a 
morafs. Oats, bear, and barley, are the grains here culti- 
vated. Lime, and dung, with fome little marl, arc the or- 
dinary articles of manure. The medium extent of the 
farms is from 100 to 200 acres. The lands are tolerably 
inclofed with ftone dikes, and here and there with ditches 
and hedges. Lint, or flax, is raifed in fmall quantuies 
Green crops, for fallowing and forage, have been tried with 
a fuccefc which has not failed to recommend the example to 
general imitation. In the harveft of 1795, the mimfter had, 
on a field before his door, one of the fineft crops of turnips 
that have ever been any where produced. Potatoes are alfo 
raifed in very great abundance. The horfes ufed for the 
draught are commonly, in value, fuch as would fell « ue 
market from L. 12 to L. 15 Sterling each.

Roads and Markets. — The roads are made and repaired 
by the money-converfion of 12 s. on every 100 merks, in- 
ftead of the ftatute-labour. From Scroggs to Debate, a dis- 
tance of about 5 or 6 miles, there is an excellent road. The 
market-towns to which the inhabitants of this parifli ufually 
refort are, Lockerby, Annan, Dumfries. The black cattle 
are fold at Dumfries, and at Lockerby, but more efpecially 
into England. Linen and woollen cloths are, for the greater 
part, not imported, but manufactured by the people for 
themfelves, in the family-way. 

Rents and Valuation. — The valuation of the parifli is 
about 1900 merks Scotch. The real rents are probably 
between L. 1700 and L. 1800 Sterling. 

Poor's Funds.-— The poor are fupported from the intereft 
of a mortified fund of L. 66 Sterling, and out of the Sunday's 
collections in the church ; which are, at ordinary times, 
about 1 s. 6 d. or a s. ; but at the annual difpenfing of the Sa- 
crament of the Lord's Supper, arife even to L. 3 Sterling. 

Minijier, Benefice, School— The prefent minifter is the 
Reverend Mr Paxton, a batchelor. His three laft prede- 
ceffors were, MefTrs Clarke, Jeffrey, Fergufion. The Im- 
pend confifts of L. 800 Scots in money, and two chalders of 
victual. There was in the year 1795 no parifli-fchool in 
Tondergarth ; but application had begun to be made for 
the eftablifhment of one. Among the inhabitants of the 
parifli are fome few Burgher and Antiburgher Seceders, 
and fome Relief people ; but none of thefe fe6ts have a 
meeting-houfe here.

this parifh ; and the old caftle of Tondergarth was once the

principal feat of the Johnfto'nes. The language of this pak 
rifh has always been a purely Saxon dialed! of the old Low« 
land Scottilh. 'tondergarth is a compound Saxon word, 
fignifying the Cdflle of the Garden^ or rather, perhaps, the 
Cajlle of the San&amp;uarjr. 

Brunfwark. — At its weftern border, this parifh almofl 
touches the bafe of the famous hill of Brunfwark. That 
hill owes its celebrity to the remains of two Roman encamp- 
ments, which appear on the eaftern and on the weftern fide 
6f its declivity. The remains of thefe encampments are 
{till exceedingly diftinft. It feems highly probable that 
they were at firft formed by the Romans befieging a body of 
the ancient Britons, who had occupied the fummit of the hill. 
It was fo remarkable a ftation, that it could not fail to be con- 
tinually occupied in all fubfequent wars among the inhabi- 
tants of thefe regions, whether contending among themfelves, 
or oppofing ilranger-invaders. The Anglo-Saxons, the 
Scotch, and Englifli, in all their border-wars, naturally port- 
ed themfelves often on the fummit of Brunfwark,fas a place, 
by its elevation above the furrounding country, admirably 
fitted at once for an impregnable poft, and for a ftation of 
profpeft, from which all the movements of furrounding 
enemies might be fpied.

<p>Situation, Extent, l#c. 

^pHE parifli of Annan lies almoft immediately upon the 
neareft Scottifh Ihore of the Solway Frith. It is 
bounded on the E. by the parifhes of Dorrock and Kirk- 
patrick-Fleming j on the N. by Middlebj and Hoddam ; 
on the W. by Cummertrees } at its fouthern extremity 
it extends, for its greateft breadth, 3 miles along the coaft ; 
its greateft length j? 8 miles. 

Soil, Surface, Coaft, River,, fcf,.— The river Annan in-

the frith, the port of Annan, an excellent natural harbour. 
There are alfo fome few brooks. The higheft tides rife

face is generally low and flat. "Woodcock- Airhill, however, 
rifes to fomcthing of elevation. The foil is clay, fandy, 
peat-earth, or a mixture of thefe. There are fome tradls of 
heath-covered muir. Woodcock- Airhill has been planted 
with wood ; and on the banks of the river Annan are alfo 
fome ftripes of planting. It was once tried to prepare kelp 
from the fea-weeds growing on the coaft, but the fea-weeds 
were found not fufHciently plentiful to encourage the conti- 
nued profecution of this undertaking. Here are excellent 
freeftone quarries, limeftone, and granite. 

Population, Heritors, Farmers, ifc. — The population of 
the whole parifti may amount to about 2500 fouls. The 
heritors paying ftipend are 60 in number of whom the 
moft confiderable are, the Earl of Hopetoun, Mr Irvin of 
Bonfhaw, Colonel Dirom of Mount-Annan, the Earl of 
Mansfield, Mr Carruthers of Warmanby, Mr Sharp of Hod- 
dam, Sir Charles Douglas, Mr John Macmurdo. There 
are about 97 or 100 farmers families ; but few hinds or cot- 
tagers. 

The To uwi.— -The town of Annan, one of the moft ancient 
burghs in Scotland, and which, in conjunaion with Loch- 
maben, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Sanquhar, fends a 
member to the Britifh Parliament, contains within the 
town, and upon the burgh-roods, 1620 fouls out of the 
whole population of the parifti. It poffefles very extenfive 
burgh-roods, which are, in great part, very -imper&amp;ffly cul- 
tivated. There is a vaft common, open to all the xnhabi- 
tants for pafture, peats, and divots; of which the divifion 
and appropriation, although repeatedly propofed, have ftiU 
been ftrenuoufly refilled. The revenue of the town is about 
L aco Sterling a-year, arifing from tolls, fifoenes, and fen- 
ces. Its houfes are in general decent and well-built 



of Annan. 



449 



A few failors belong to it ; and there are 5 floops, the property 
of inhabitants of the town or burgh-roods. There are like- 
wife two ferry-boats employed for paffage to and from the 
coaft of Cumberland. The burgh, not long fince, fupplied, 
as its proportion, two failors to the royal navy. It has in 
it four writers ; one furgeon ; a fchoolmafter, whofe emolu- 
ments are, of falary and fubfcription, L. 40, of wages, L. 25. 
The port is comprehended within the diftricl: of the cuftom- 
houfe of Dumfries. Day-labourers are fupplied from the 
town, for moft of the farm-work in the country part of the 
parifh. The occupations of its other inhabitants are thofe 
of merchant and fhopkeeper, weaver, blackfmith, tailor, 
joiner, fhoemaker, tanner, currier, clog-maker. 

Fijberies.— The fifhery, on the coaft and in the river, af- 
fords employment and fubfiftence to many of the inhabi- 
tants of this parifh. The fifheries are let at the annual rent 
of L. 210 Sterling. A curious fpecies of net is ufed here 
for taking falmon, both at the flowing and during the ebb- 
ing of the tides. Befide falmons, which are plentiful and 
excellent, hirlings, muffels, flounders, cod, whitings, prawns, 
fcate, and fometimes turbot, are found oii this coaft.

Exports and Imports — The articles of export are, pota- 
toes and grain to Liverpool, Whitehaven, and the Frith of 
Clyde; freeftone to Ireland; black-cattle, cotton-yarn, 
fhoes, and clogs, to the contiguous inland parts of England. 
In return are imported, merchants goods in general from 
Liverpool; London goods by the way of Newcaftle and 
Carlifle; iron and timber in deals from Gottenburah. 

Roads.— This parifh is interfered by great roads palling 
between Dumfries and Catlifle, between Annan and Edin- 
burgh by Moffat, between Annan and Edinburgh by Lang-

holm. On the great roads are toll-bars. The crofs roads 
are made and repaired by the converfion-money for the 
ftatute-labour, which is at the rate of 3 d. for every pound 
Sterling of real rent, from the inhabitants of the burgh •, and 
12 s. on each 100 merk.s of valuation, from the landward 
part of the parilh. 

Agriculture, Cattle, Servants, fac— -The farms are of 
fmall extent : One only pays fit? large a rent as L. 100 a- 
year. The average rent from the land-ward part of the 
parilh runs from 3 s. to 25 s. an acre : The average rent of 
the burgh-roods is from 10 s. 6 d. to 50s. an acre. The wages 
of fervants are, tp men-fervants, with their boarding, from, 
L 6 to L. 10 a-year ; to maid-fervants, equally with their 
board, from i». 3 to L. 5 a-year. Day-labourers receive, 
with their vi&amp;uals, lpd. a-day ; and for fevere labour, 
without victuals, is. 6 d. Black cattle are the chief ani- 
mal (lock of the farms \ are reared generally from calves 
within the parilh ; and have been multiplied in their num- 
bers lince green crops and fown graffes came into ufe here. 
Horfes are ufed here, as in other places, for work and ri- 
ding ; fame few are bred and reared from foals within the 
parilh. Barley is the chief article of white crop; oats 
come next in quantity after barley ; here is alfo a little 
wheat raifed and exported. Potatoes are produced in great 
quantities. Many hogs are fed, killed, cured for bacon, 
and in this ftate exported. Here are but few fheep. 

Rotation of Crops.— Peafe, beans, and turnips, are the ar- 
ticles of fallowing green crop. Lime, dung, fome little 
marl, and fleech from the fea more, are the ufual articles of 
manure, The rotation of culture is, 1. Potatoes, turnips,

manure ; 5. From 3 to 5 years, pafture ; 6. Two fucceffive^ 
white crops, commonly oats ; 7. Return to the commence- 
ment of the fame rotation. It is a comport which is ufed 
for the top-dreffing. Inclofures have become general, al- 
though but lately ; they are made with ditches and hedges; 
and in fome places with dry ftone walls. 

Houfes, Mode of Livings fcfc— Such farm houfes as have 
been lately built are good and commodious, and of one or 
two ftories. The office-houfes are arranged in fquares, 
with large open fheds for black cattle. Servants and mat- 
ter eat commonly at the fame table. The farmer's Sun- 
day clothes are of Englifh cloth. Peats and coal are both 
commonly ufed for fuel. The coal is fold at 7 s. 6d. for 
the ton of cwt. The climate and fituation are reckon- 
ed healthy. Epidemical fevers are unknown. Coni'umption 
and ague are rare. The harveft is generally early. In the 
year 1782, the crops were plentiful. There is on the river 
a cotton-work, about which from loo to 130 men, women, 
and children, are commonly employed. One or two wea- 
vers in the town manufacture fome checks. 

Antiquities and Hiflory.— Annan, the name of this town 
and parifh, feems to have been primarily the name of the 
nver only. Its radical fyllable is one of thofe words which 
were ufed in the ancient Britifh tongue to fignify limply 
'water, or a river, Annan was probably a Roman ftation, 
^ Veromum of the anonymous geographer of Ravenna, 
it feems to have been ftill occupied by the Britons of the 
vveft after the departure of the Romans, till they were fub- 
dued by the Anglo-Saxons of Northumberland. When 
the kmgdom of Northumberland was overthrown, Anna* 
fell into the poffeffion of the Scotch. While Cumberland, 
and the greater p art of Northumberland, were poflVffed by

Malcom Canmore, and his fucceflbrs, to William the Lion, 
Annan was, as well as Carlifle, one of their principal ports* 
It was foon after obtained in fief, with the whole territory 
of Annandale, and the port of Lochmaben, by the anceftor 
of King Robert Bruce. The Bruces built here a flately 
caftle, of which the ruins (till remain. By the fucceffion of 
the Bruces to the Scottifh throne, Annan became a royal 
bur^h, obtaining then thofe privileges which it has ever 
iince retained. Edward Balliol, during his attempts to 
wreft the kingdom from young David Bruce, was furprifed 
at the Caftle of Annan by a fudden expedition of the Dou- 
glafles from Moffat, and with difficulty made his efcape out 
of their hands, flying naked and alone into England. While 
the Douglaffes were wardens of thefe marches, all Annan- 
dale was theirs; and Annan, although a royal burgh, could 
not refill their authority. After their forfeiture, it became 
fubjedt chiefly to the Johnftones, with whom it has, in a 
great meafure, ever fince remained. And yet the exten- 
five burgh domains render the burgefles of Annan almoft 
independent of the landlords of the furrounding country. 
Many remarkable military tran factions of the border-war- 
fare between the Scotch and Englifh took place at Annan, 
and in its vicinity. Annan was one principal refidence of 
thofe bold men of Annandale, famous in the Scottifh hif- 
tory for exercifing fuch conftant warfare with the Englifh 
borderers, that they became, even in refpecl: to their Sv;ot- 
tifk neighbours, incapable of the order, the moderation, the 
civil fubmiffion of peace.

<p>Situation and Extent, ifc. 

Hp HE parifh of Tarbolton, fituated in Kyle, the middle 
-■- diftrift of Ayrfhire, furrounded by the parifties of 
Craigie, Mauchlin, Stair, Coylton, St Quivox, and Monk- 
ton, is a high-lying traft of ground, of between feven and 
eight miles in length, and about fix in breadth. It is about 
five miles from the fea-coaft ; and its elevation above the 
level of the fea, feems to exceed the middle height between 
the higheft and the loweft parts of the county. Its ancient 
and natural afpeft has evidently been fufficiently rude and 
*ild } bare and unfheltered ; varied with frequent inequa- 
lities of furface j marihy in the hollows, on the heights

overgrown with heath. But the rude afpe£t of nature featf 
here, long fince, given place to the beauties and the wealth 
of induftrious cultivation. 

Number of the Inhabitants, IS c — The number of the in- 
habitants of this parifh was, in the year 1755, about 1365, 
It has been fince rather diininifhed than augmented, and 
may be at prefent calculated not greatly to exceed 1200 ; 
of whom about 450 are inhabitants of the village of Tar- 
bolton. The heritors are 19; and of thefe the principal 
are, the Earl of Eglinton, lately Colonel Montgomery of 
Coilsfield, Mr Cunningham of Enterkine, the Marquis of 
Titchfield, Mr Cooper of Smithftone, the heirs of Colonel 
Hunter, Dr Hunter of Park, Captain Davidfon of Drum- 
ley, Mr Neill of Schaw. The farmers are in number 
about 130. In the village are feveral Jlocking-makers. 
Around it are the pofleflions of feveral of thofe fmall pro- 
prietors, who are ufually diftinguifhed by the appellation 
of portioners. Here is a farmer fociety, for the purpofes of 
the friendly focieties now common in Scotland ; as alfo a 
farmer club, for the ends of agricultural improvement. In 
the village are two mafon lodges, 

Animal Stock and Valuation. — The animal (lock on the 
lands in the parifh has been reckoned at about 3-86 horfes, 
1800 cows, and 500 fheep. The valued rent is between 
L. 7000 and L. 8000 Scotch. 

Dairies. —The capital fpecies of induftfy followed by the 
farmers, is, the management of cattle for the tifes of the 
dairy. The leafes are commonly for nineteen years, and 
reftrift the tenants to the generally received modes of cul- 
tivation. The cows are of a race famous for the abund- 
ance of their milk. They are frequently brindled, and 

have

hare fliort heads, ftraight backs, and fquare ribs. A prodi- 
gious quantity of butter and cheefe is annually made here 
for fale : And in the preparation of thefe articles, the peo- 
ple of this parifh, as well as the other inhabitants of this 
middle diftricl: of Ayrfhire, are well known to excel the 
farmers of every other part of Scotland. 

Agriculture. -—Barley and oats are the prevalent articles 
pf grain-crop. The lands are carefully fubdivided and in- 
clofed, here and there with hedge rows of trees and belts of 
planting. Potatoes are the principal article of green crop j 
among other varieties of the potatoe, there is particularly 
a beautiful long white one, very advantageoufly in ufehere. 
The gardens afford abundance of pulfe and pot-herbs. The 
climate is here, as around this weftern coaft in general, moift, 
and fubjeft to frequent rains. Yet it is fufficiently genial; 
for in the middle of September in the year 1795, the har- 
veft was more than one half advanced. The foil is a red- 
dim loam ; and here and there are confiderable ftrata of 
/.d earth. The culture of turnips, as a crop for forage 
and for fallowing, is not yet fully eftablifhed in this parifh; 
but begins to be continually more and more adopted. 

Houfes, Fuel, ciV._The farm-houfes and office-houfes are 
commodioufly arranged in a fquare, open in front ; and ha- 
ving, on this fide, before the door of the dwelling-houfe, a 
fmooth green, a pond of water, and the dunghill. They 
are covered with thatching, and are ufually a n€ ftory i n 
height. Sown graffes are univerfally in ufe throughout 
this parifh. The common proportion between the grafs 
and the corn in the agriculture of a farm, gives one-third 
or the arable ground to the latter ; to the former two-thirds. 
imt % far manure, is not indeed found within the parifh ; 

but

but is obtained in great abundance, and at a reafonable price, 
in its immediate neighbourhood. Peats and pit-coal are 
the common fuel ; the latter is obtained in plenty from no 
great diftance. It is in one quarter only of the parifti that 
barley has been found to anfwer as an article of crop. The 
inhabitants are, in general, a flout, healthy, cleanly, good- 
looking people, not ill educated, and ftill impreffed with a 
great and ferious refpecl: for the ordinances of religion. 

Markets and Roads. — The neareft market towns are, Ayr, 
Irvine, Kilmarnock, and Mauchlin. The crofs roads are 
numerous, well laid, and kept in good condition ; but with 
this difadvantage, that they are condu&amp;ed without any dif- 
tin&amp;ion, indifferently up heights, and down into hollows. 
Ayrftiire, abounding in coal and limeftone, demanded for 
the conveyance of thefe, good roads, at a time when, in other 
parts of Scotland, roads were not thought to be worthy of 
great attention in parifti-police ; and when fuch attention 
had not yet been paid to them in this country, as was ne- 
ceffary to difcover how much better it is to conduct a road 
round the bafe of a hill, than over its fummit. 

Minifler and School, The prefent parifh minifter of 

Tarbolton is the Reverend Mr Ritchie. The church is in 
a decent condition. A new manfe has juft been built for 
the prefent incumbent. The value of the benefice does 
not exceed L. 150 a-year, nor yet fall greatly fhort of it. 
The parifhioners, from the higheft to the loweft, give a 
decent and diligent attendance at church. The parifh 
fchool matter's emoluments may be about L. 50 a-year. 
Latin, arithmetic, writing, the reading of Englifh, are taught 
in the fchool. 



CoUeclions 



of Tarbolton. 



Collections for the Poor — The average Sunday collec- 
tions for the poor are from 12 s. to 15 s. jn amount. At 
the difpenfation of the Sacrament, and upon other extraor- 
dinary occafions, the collection arifes to from L. 2 to L. 5. 

Antiquities.— Tarholton was mod probably a ftation of 
the Danes, at that remote period of our ancient hiftory, 
when thefe people poffeffed all the northern and weftern 
ifles adjacent to Scotland, and even confiderable polls and 
poffeflions upon the fliores of the mainland. Clofely con- 
tiguous to the village is a mount, now named Flood's Hill, 
which ftrikingly exhibits the appearance of an old Danifh 
encampment and fortification. Adjacent, at no great dif- 
tance, within the beautifully ornamented grounds which 
furround the houfe of Coilsfield, are a fcene, which the tra- 
dition of the country relates to have been a field of battle • 
and a none held in veneration as the monument of old King 
Coil. It may more probably have been the fcene of a bat- 
tle between the Danifh invaders, and the old Gaelic inha- 
bitants ctf the country. The rude flone may have been 
originally placed to cover the body of iome chieftain, al-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1009662">LONGFORGAN</name>, 

(County of Perth, Synod of Angus and Mearns, 
Presbytery of Dundee.) 

By a Proprietor in the Pari/h, a Friend to Statijlical 

Inquiries.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parifh of Longforgan lies on the fouth-eaft corner 
of the county of Perth, in the prefbytery of Dundee^ 
and fynod of Angus and Mearns. It is bounded on the S. 
by the river Tay, on the W. by the united parifhes of lnch- 
ture and Roffie, and the parifh of Abernyte ; on the N. by 
the parifh of Kittens ; and on the E. by the united parifhes 
of Fowlis Eafter and Lundie, and of Liff and Benvy. Its 
lhape is irregular. Its greateft. length 7 miles, and its 
greateft breadth about 3^ miles ; but in fome places it is fo 
narrow, that the whole parifh does not contain above 7000 
acres. 

Name* 



4^6 Statiflkal Account 



Name.— -The derivation of the name Forgan is unknown, 
but it muft be very ancient, and appears to have been ori- 
ginally called Forgund, from a grant of the lands and baro- 
ny of Longforgund to Sir Andrew Gray of Broxmouth, by 
King Robert Bruce, in the year 13 15. The epithet Long, 
probably, is applicable to the village only, to diftmgtnfli it 
from others of the fame name. 

Contents. — It contains the eftates of Caftle Huntly and: 
Monorgan, Drimmie, Millhill, Knap, Dron, and Littleton, 
Mylnefield, Laurifton, Lochton, two Ballos, two Newtons, 
and Temple Hall. 

Rent and Heritors. — The valued rent is L. 7254 : 6 : 8 
Scotch. The real rent would be difficult to afcertain, but 
it may be about L. 7000 Sterling per annum, which will 
moft probably be confiderably increafed when the prefent 
kafes are expired. There are eleven heritors, fix of whom 
refide, the reft do not. 

Climate — The climate, in the lower part of this parilh k 
mild, fnow feldom lying above a week at a time ; but in 
tho hilly part it is lefs fo. There, the fnow lies much 
longer in winter, and there is at leaft three weeks differ- 
ence between the ripening of the crops above and below 
the hills. All over the parifli, however, the weather is 
various, and frequently changes very confiderably two or 
three times in a day. The winters are neither long nor 
feverc. The fprings are fhort. In the month of May, and 
beginning of June, cold eafterly winds prevail; but in 
general the weft and fouth-weft winds are the moll preva- 
lent through the year. In June and July, the weather is 
warm and fine. About the beginning of Auguft rains are 
frequent ; but the autums are fine, and frofts feldom fet in 
very fevere till after Chriftmas

Surface, Hills. — The furface of the parifh is very irrege* 
lar. Its fouthern boundary upon the Tay to the eaftward, 
is bold and fteep, which ends in the rocky promontory of 
Kingoody. From that point a beautiful bank rifes, and as 
it proceeds north and weft, it takes the fhape of a crefcent, 
and ends in a bluff point, at a place called the Snabs of 
Drimmie, about 3 miles from its beginning, below; which, 
and between it and the river Tay, the furface is a perfect 
plain, its loweft part upwards of 2,0 feet above the bed of 
the river, and forms the eaftermoft part of that fertile vale, 
well known by the name of the Carfe of Gowrie. About 
half a mile north from the village of Longforgan, this bank 
finks into a narrow vale, which runs acrofs the parifh, and 
from which rifes a range of hills, which may be confidered 
as part of the Sidlaws. Thefe divide Strathmore from the 
Carfe of Gowrie, and end at Perth. There are three re- 
markable hills in this parifh, Dron, Ballo, and Lochtown. 
The firft is 667 feet ; the fecond, 992 feet ; and the laft, 
1 1 72. feet above the level of the fea. 

Rivers, Fijbings, and Rivulets.^-There is no river con- 
nefted with this parifh but the Tay, which bounds it on 
the fouth for nearly three miles. It is here between two 
and three miles broad, and when the tide ebbs, it leaves 
near a mile of dry fand between its bank and the ftream or 
current of the river. At prefent, the river Tay is famous 
for its excellent falmon, from Enrol upwards ; and again, 
W here it narrows near the Caftle of Broughty, about three 
miles below Dundee; but none are caught now where it 
bounds this parifb ; although formerly there might have 
been fome, a* the right of fifhing for falmon is attached by

take their rife in this parifh f« 

Minerals. Hitherto nothing has been extra&amp;ed from the 

bowels of the earth in this parifli but (tone and fhell marl; 
but there are feveral mineral fprings, particularly about 
Caftle Huntly, which are ftrongly impregnated with iron; 
and from the red colour of the foil in many parts, and from 
the weight and appearance of ftones found very near the 
furface, there is every reafon to believe that the bank of 
Forgan .abounds with iron ore. 

Stone 

* If ever falmon were caught in that part of the river which bounds this 
parifli, it muft have been at a very remote poriod, probably before the Tay 
formed its junction with the Erne at Inchyra, and when the Carfe land ex- 
tended much farther fouth, and occupied a great part of what now forms 
the bed of the river Tay, 

f Two of thefe rivulets rife from one point, directly north from Long- 
forgan, in that vale which runs acrofs the parifli. One, taking an eaftem 
direction, unites with the burn of Benvy, ibuth of Gray, turns two corn- 
mills, a fulling-mill, and one flour-mill ; and after ferving as a boundary 
between the counties of Perth and Forfar, for a great part of its courfe, it 
empties itfelf into the Tay at Invergowrie Bay. The other, running weft- 
ward, enters Lord Kinnaird's park in the parifli of Roflie, where it falls im- 
mediately into a larger ftreara, which takes its rife in the upper part of this 
parifli, and which, in its courfe, before the junction, turns five corn-mills, 
four lintrmills, one barley-mill in this parifli, and one threfliing-mill in the 
parifli of Rpflie. After they are united, they continue in a weftern direc- 
tion as far as the Old Caftle of Moncur, and are there joined by the burn 
of Balledgarno. This united ftream there takes a foutherly direction, and 
for a confiderable way divides the two parifhes of Inchture and Longforgan. 
It agai* enters this parifli, and proceeding eaftward, panes through the 
parks of Caflle Huntly, turns a corn-mill at Monorgan, after which, its 
ftream, being guided by a canal, dug within flood-mark, at a confiderable 
expence, within thefe few years, it wafhes the harbour of Kingoody, and 
empties itfelf into the Tay fouth of Mylnefield, under the name of the Burn 
of Monorgan, but in the charters and old writings it is called the Burn of 
Mountain. This burn, through its whole courfe, abounds with excellent 
ff»mt.

Stone Quarries.— The ftone quarries in this parifli are 
many and various, but the principal is at Kingoody, upon 
the eftate of Mylnefield, which is perhaps one of the beft in 
Great Britain *. 

There 

* The Kingoody ftone is of a greyifii colour, called by minerologifts 
Gmn-flone; it is difficult to work; hard and durable to an uncommon 
degree; fo much fo, that the fine old tower the fteeple of Dundee, which 
was built of it in King David the Second's time, has mown fcarce any fymp- 
toms of decay, except where the influence of the town atmofphere reaches 
Caftle Huntly, fuppofed to be built jn 1452, has fcarce a ftone in it which 
has yielded to the influence of the weather; and a gate at that place built 
of Kingoody ftone, by Earl Patrick of Strathmore, 130 years ago, is crowned 
with four pyramids, the points of which appear perfectly entire at this day, 
(1797), not meafuring more in diameter than r-i6th of an inch. Thefe 
are only a few amongft many inftances of its durability. It produces ftone 
of all ffees, and for every purpofe of building, as it affords blocks of 50 feet 
in length by 16 in breadth ; afro ftone for pavements, millftones, iktes, &amp;c. 
In this quarry fome ftone is railed of a bluifli caft, of an exceeding fine 
grain, and capable of a polifh, little-fhort of fome marble. The deeper in 
the quarry the ftone is the better; it is foft below watermark, and it is 
eafier worked, but hardens in the common air. 

The beft ftone in this quarry feems to lie in a north-eafterly direction, but 
as its bed proceeds north and weft, it degenerates, at Ieaft it appears lb, as 
far as it has yet been traced. About a mile weftward below Longforgan, 
it has the appearance of reddifh granite ; but it is foft, and feems to yield to 
the hammer, and diffolves fo entirely with friction and moifture, that it has 
been found totally unfit for metalling roads, but, it has been ufed, and does 
very well for building common village-houfes ; farther weft it has more of 
that red colour, and becomes heavy, as if it tended to iron ore. 

Mr Mylne, the proprietor, employs from fifty to fixty hands in the quarry 
of Kingoody ; four boats for tranfporting ftone, which are navigated by 
nine hands, and not only fends ftones to the whole extent from Montrofe to 
Perth by water, but like wife for 15 or 16 miles of country round by land- 
carriage. He alfo fends confiderable quantities to England ; and lately 
undertook, by contract, to fumifti ftones from this quarry tp two navigable 
canals, the one called the Gippon's Navigation, near Ipfwich; the other, 
the Chelmesford Canal, near Maldon, in Effex. He has built a confiderable 
village upon the fpot for the labourers, the inhabitapts of which at prefent 
^piount to 116 of all ages. 

Althpugh 



of Lonforgan. 



^here are alfo in this parifh feveral other (lone-quarries. 
Upon the eftates of Dron and Ballo, the ftone is good, du- 
rable, and excellent for every purpofe of building. At 
Millhiil, the ftone is foft, and of a bluifh caft, which does 
not ftand the weather, but fplits into fmall lamella upon 
being expofed. However, it ahfwers very well for infide 
walls, andj if under cover, will laft many years. At L u- 
rifton, the ftone inclines to a dufky black, is much harder, 
and, when polifned, has the appearance of marble. It is a 
real limeftone, but not very ftrong ; however, were coals, 
or proper fuel near enough to bring the burning within a 
reafonable expence, it might anfwer very well Below the 
Bank of Forgan there are feveral rocky protuberances, all 
of them a very hard bluifh whin, very difficult to raife ; 
and although fome of them have been ufed for village hou- 
fes, yet, as there is no working them either with the ham- 
mer or the chiffel, they have been principally ufed for the 
turnpike, and other public roads. Caftle-Huntly is built 
upon one of thefe rocky eminences.

Although it does not properly belong to this paper to interfere with the

aft of Parliament, for impoiing a duty upon ftone lea- borne, by the re- 
venue officers, the exportation of ftone from this quarry, ih all probability 
will foon be at an end. For, although the whole revenue arifmg to Go- 
vernment, betwixt the 5 th day of July , 794 and the 5 th day of July 1795 
from this duty, was only L. 16 : 18 : 3f , yet, from the diftance between 
Kingoody and the ports of Perth and Dundee, fuch is the difficulty of pro- 
curing coaft-difpatches for a cargo of ftone, worth only r 7 s. and not ex- 
ceeding 10 d per ton in value, as to prolong a voyage, performed, before 
the commencement of this aft, in twelve hours, to three days, Whatever

iay of work equal to twenty times the value of the duty paid.

Marl. — There has been found in this parifli a confidef- 
able quantity of fhell-marl, very pure and white. The 
prefent proprietor of CalUe-Huntly has fold near 60,000 
bolls, at 8 d. and 9 d. per boll, (a cube of two feet), fince 
the year 1779 ; but it is now exhaufted, or lies fo deep, it 
is not worth the working. In the bed containing this marl, 
fome red deers horns were found fome years ago, uncom- 
monly large. 

Coal. — There is alfo a tradition, that there are coals at 
Myrefide in this parilh, and that fome attempts to difcover 
them were begun in 17 15, but failed from fome caufe, now 
unknown. However, a very ingenious chymift, lately, 
was fo fully perfuaded that coals might be found in the le- 
vel grounds below Forgan, that he made fome propofals to 
work them at his own expence, but certain reafons made 
the proprietors drop any attempt for the time. 

Growing Timber. — Upon every eftate in this parifli there 
are great plenty of fine growing timber, of all ages, and va- 
rious kinds, fuch as oak, am, elm, plane, poplar, lime r 
horfe-chefnute, walnute, beech, fir, larix, mountain-am, ly- 
bernum, See many of them from too- to 150 years of age, 
particularly at Longforgan, Mylnefield, Caftle-Huntly, and 
at thehoufe of Drimmie; and alfo in hedge-rows all over 
the parifli, befides about 600 acres of fine thriving young, 
plantations, from 20 to 40 years old *. 

Marjlj 

* In the year 1743, a furvcy was taken of the growing timber on the eftate 
of Caftle-Huntly, then Caftle-Lyon. It was found to contain 8557 trees of 
all forts, valued at L. 2813 : 5 : a. Amongft thefe were a great number of 
fweet chefnut trees, which were fold fome time afterwards, and were 
bought up by fhip carpenters, who confidered them as good, if not better, 
for the pnrpofe of fhip-building than oak. There are a much greater num-

Marfh Reed. — A fpecies of the arundo, called phragmites y 
or common marlh-reed, and whicTi grows by the fides of 
rivers, or in ftanding waters, is found in great abundance 
here. Of late years it has been propagated upon the banks 
of the river Tay with great fuccefs, particularly at Errol 
and Seafide ; and ever fince the threfhing-mills have been 
eftablifhed, which totally difqualify the wheat-ltraw for 
thatch, the propagation of reeds has been an objedt of confi- 
derable importance to proprietors, for they are fold at a 
guinea for one hundred bunches, each meafuring one yard 
round, and they are fure of a ready market for as many as 
they can raife j and the introduction of reeds for thatch is 
attended with this advantage to farmers, that the wheat- 
ftraw is now condemned to the dung-court, and is applied 
where it ought to be, to increafe the manure of the farm *.

ber of trees upon the fame eftate now, but they have not been valued. 
Amongft others, there are fome very remarkable, fuch as an afh, called 
Glamifs tree, which meafures 27 feet round, near the root, and 17 feet a 
yard high ; another alh, 19 feet round near the root, and 14 a yard high ; 
elms, 11 feet; horfe-chefnuts, 10 feet; poplars, 10 feet; firs, 9 feet; 
planes, 9 feet; yews, 6 feet ; lime, 7 feet three inches; thorns, 6 feet ; one 
thorn, 6 feet 10 inches ; all taken at about 3 feet from the ground. One 
fir, at a yard from the ground, 13 feet 6 inches ; clofe to the ground, 19 
feet ; and the diameter of the top is %i yards. And, within thefe few 
years, planes have been fold for L. 13 and L. 14 each; and firs cut down 
containing 90, and a beech blown down this year (1796), containing 127 
cubic feet of mealurable wood in their trunks. 

The oaks, in general, are young ; none, or very few, above 50 or 60 
years old : but they thrive remarkably well, particularly in the clay ; as a 
proof of which, there are many upon the eftate of Caftle-Huntly, planted 
from the nurfery in 1761, which mcafure from 4 to 5 feet round. The 
larix is but lately introduced here ; but it thrives well, and upon every kind 
of foil. There are great plenty of walnuts, the fruit of which ripens well 
in general. 

* About 20 years ago, the late Mr Henry Crawford of Monorgan made 
the firft attempt to plant reeds upon the fides of the Tay, which bounds this 

parifli,

Orchards — There are five orchards in the parifh, all in 
a thriving condition, particularly at Monorgan, which is 
reckoned the bell in the Carfe of Gowrie, and has been 
famous thefe many years for yielding fine fruit. 

Horticulture. — The only gardens in this parifh worthy of 
notice are at Cattle Huntly. There are above 300 feet of 
glafs; a melon-pit, of 20 feet by 12, worked by it earn 
alone, without dung, and plenty of peaches, ne&amp;arins, apri-' 
cots, tigs, almonds, and oiher fruits, which ripen on the 
open wali. 

Steam Melon-pit. — As the fleam melon-pit is rather new, 
it may be an uieful information to fay, that the pit is 20 

feet; 

parifh., but without fuccefs ; and although he planted many acres, a very 
i'mall ipot only, upon the we.ierniolt point of the eilate has produced any 
thing like a crop. To make reeds thrive, two things are necefiary; \Jl, A 
certain depth of that kind of foil which rivers deppiit ; and,2f, Aiufhcient 
fence, to protect both the toil itlelf, and the new planted reeds, from the 
violence of the flux and reflux of the tide. Mr Crawford thought it would 
be fufficient to carry out into the river fences made of the weedings of 
young firs, cut into flakes, and driven deep into the foil, (or fleet, as it is 
called here), and wattled with the fmaller wood, which anfwered very well, 
for Ibme time ; the foil increafed in bulk ; the reeds were planted, and ap- 
peared to thrive ; but the v.olence of the tide foon carried fences, reeds, 
and foil before it; and now, fcarce a veftige of any thing remains. Some 
mounds, however, a coniidcrable way within water-mark, are forming of 
themfelves, and in feyeral places fhowing a kind of lower grafs ; and when- 
ever it gathers fuel; a firmnefs, reeds, if planted, will probably thrive. If 
once fairly eltabliflied, they propagate themfelves without trouble, and give 
a crop every year. The fame kind of reed ihews itfelf in conliderable quan- 
tities, in feveral fields next die river, and through the Carie, which it is im- 
poihble to get rid of, as they rife from roots exceedingly deep, fome of 
■which have been traced . 8 feet below die furface. Hence they cannot be 
fuppofed to rob the prolific (urface of any nounfliment ; but as they ripen

feet by 12, and is fo conftru&amp;ed as to receive the fteam 
from a boiler of caft-iron, containing ten Englifh gallons, 
placed over a furnace, built about the middle of the back- 
wall, into a chamber, occupying the whole fpace below the 
melon-earth, which is fupported by an arch of brick, fo 
built, that the ends of the bricks leave about an inch open 
fpace for the fteam to pafs, while the fides are cemented 
with lime, over which is placed a layer of wheai-ftraw, 
about an inch thick, and then the melon-mould. The pit 
is about four feet deep behind, and two and a half or three 
before. A pit, of the above dimenlions, will require two 
longitudinal arches, the one next the iorepart of the pit, 
lower than the one parallel to the back part, lb as to give a 
proper declivity to the furface of the melon-earth ; and the 
mid wall, which fupports the arches, is full of openings, to. 
let the fleam p 1 is freely ; care alfo muft be taken, to to con* 
flrudl the funnel for dividing the fteam, that it may bear 
equally upon all parts of the frame. Melons raifed in this 
way are thought to be thinner fkinned, and rather higher 
flavoured than thofe produced in the common way. 

Pine Stoves. — No doubt, fleam might be applied to pine 
ftoves with equal advantage ; and it is probable, that the 
pit above defcribed, or one upon the fame principles, would 
anfwer every purpofe of railing pines, 

Vinery. — At Caflle Huntly fleam is introduced into a 
vinery, and it is propofed to be tried in peach-houfes alfo ; 
but in thefe laft, the fleam is guided by pipes of tinned 
copper, i\ inch in diameter, conducted from the boiler, pla- 
ced over the fame furnace which heats the houfe, and car- 
ried round about half a foot above the back flue, and 14, 
foot above the front flue, but in a contrary direction, with 
yocks opening at different places, fo as ta divide the fleam,

tremity of the fleam pipe, a a, is conduced to the outride

tributes very much to preferve the trees from fufFering by 
various infecls. 

Fruits ripen. — Fruits ripen upon the common wall as 
under. Cherries about the laft week of June and beginning 
of July ; apricots the firft and fecond week in Auguft ; 
pears from the end of July to October ; jarganells the firft 
week in September ; peaches, in fine feafons, in Auguft, 
and continue through September and October; but all of 
them ripen fooner or later, according to their various fpe- 
cies, and the difference of the feafons. 

Village of Longforgun.-~'Y\iZ village of Longforgan, which 
gives name to the pariih, occupies 23 Scotch acres, and is 
beautifully fituated upon the creft of thatrifing'ground, which 
runs between Kingoody and Drimmie, and bounds the 
eaftmofl corner of the Carfe of Gowrie on that fide, and 
from which it commands a fine view of the river Tay, for 
above 20 miles. Its longitude weft from Greenwich is 3° 
16/ 45", and its latitude 56 0 2f 48". 



Origin 



of Long/organ* 



Origin.-*-The origin of this village moil probably had 
been for the accommodation of the retainers, and the more 
immediate dependents of the Baron of the Caftle ; and mod 
probably all ancient villages owed their origin to the fame 
eaufe. For they paid little or no rent, but what they did. 
pay was moftly in kind. The reft was made up in a variety 
of fervices ; fo that their whole time, almoft, was at the 
command of thoir fuperior ; and alfo their perfonal attend- 
ance on their fuperior in the field was an effential and indif- 
penfible condition of their poffefiions; and except this laft, 
fuch was the exadl lituation of the villagers of Longforgart 
not 50 years ago. They were bound to plough the ground 
of the mains or family-farm, to fow, reap, carry it into the 
barn-yard, threfh it out, and take it to market ; to fetch 
lime, ftone, flates, and fand, or any thing elfe wanting for 
the caftle or demefnes ; to plant all the trees upon the eftate ; 
to give fo many days labour in the gardens or fields ; to be 
ready at all times to go meffages, either on foot or on horfe- 
back, to any diftance ; and, in ftiort, there was fcarce any 
kind of fervitude about the place they were not bound to 
perform, many of which continued till the prefent proprie- 
tor came in poffeflion. 

Inhabitants. — The village belongs entirely to the eftate 
of Caftle-Huntly ; confifts of one principal ftreet, which is 
now a turnpike-road, and feveral lanes. It contains 126 
families, which, at 5 for each family, makes 630 inhabi- 
tants of all ages. Of thefe, 3 are confiderable farmers from 
L. 60 to L. 150 per annum ; 36 are fmall farmers or acre- 
men, paying from L.5 rent to L. 16 per annum. Of this laft 
clafs almoft every one has a trade or occupation ; fo that 
the management of his little farm is the employment of his 
leifure hours only, which improves his health, and gives 
him many little comforts, which he could not expefr. other- 
wife.

wife. Befides thefe, there are alfo manufacturers, trades- 
men, and labourers, who have ho land, but all of them have 
yards (garden*) attached to their houfes. 

Burgh of Barony. — Tn the year 1672, Longforgan was 
erefted into a free burgh of barony, by a charter of King 
Charles II. in favour of Patrick Earl of Strathmore, there- 
in defigned Earl of Kinghorn ; with power to ereft and 
conftitute bailies, burgeffes, clerks, officers, fergeants, &amp;c. 
and to admit all kinds of trades to a variety of privileges ; 
to have a weekly market within the burgh, and to have 
two free yearly fairs ; one on the firft Tuefday of the month 
of July ; and the other, the firft Tuefday of Oftober ; and 
each to laft three days ; the duties and cuftoms of which to 
be levied by and applied to the fole ufe of the proprietor. 

Markets. — Thofe yearly fairs, however, are now held, 
one on the third Wednefday of June, and the other on 
the third Wednefday of Oclober, and continue each only 
one day. They are principally cattle markets, but are fre- 
quented by a number of travelling merchants, and a variety 
of articles, ufually expofed to fale in other country fairs, are 
to be found here. At the fummer market of Longforgart, 
all the farm-fervants for the whole Carfe are ufually hired 
for the enfuing year. This cuftom, although of long {land- 
ing, is by no means a good one, as the fervant, if hired to 
another, remains with his prefent matter from June to the 
Martinmas following, perhaps very much againft the inte- 
reft of the one, and the moral reftitude or good conduct of 
the other. The cuftoms belong to Caftle-Huntly, and for 
both fairs are generally from L. 6 to L. 7, 10 s. 

Inns.— There are two inns in the village, one at the weft 
end very convenient for the accommodation of country 

paffengers;

paflengers ; and another about the middle of the town, upon 
a much larger fcale, with a brew-houfe, malt-barn, bake- 
houfe, and good ftabling attached to it *. 

Villages. 

* There are ftill remaining a few of the old houfes in Longforgan, which 
fhew what they were 20 years ago. They are very bad, narrow, low roofed, 
and inconvenient ; they are built with turf and ftone, or with clay for mor- 
tar, and all thatched with turf and ftraw ; not a veftige of lime was then 
to be feen in the village. Since that time, all the houfes capable of being 
made habitable have been repaired ; between 50 and 60 new houfes have 
been built by the prefent proprietor, belides two fets of farm offices for lar- 
ger farmers, feveral barns and byres, and two fmithies, all within the village; 
The new houfes are generally z$ or 30 feet by 15 within walls, and the 
door in the middle; they are divided into two good apartments upon the 
ground-floor, with a window to each to the ftreet, and a frrialler room iu 
the middle, with a window backwards, which ferves as a ftore-room to the 
family. In general, weavers have their houfes fitted for their particular 
convenience ; but almoft every one has a fmall apartment, neatly plaftered 
with lime, and fitted up according to the tafte of the pofieflbr. They are 
built with ftone and lime. The floors are of earth or clay. The garrets 
above are laid with deal, and they are covered either with fewed thatch of 
wheat-ftraw, tiles, or flares, with fky-lights, Thefe houfes, when built, 
eoft from L. 30 to L. 50, according to the fize, materials, &amp;c. The fame 
defection may ferve- both for the . old and the new houfes all over the 
parifh. 

In the middle of the village there was a Ci ofs,. confifting of a pillar of 
sne ftone, wish a lion on the top of it, ftanding upon a pedeftal of mafonry 
of feveral fteps ; the whole height of the ftone pillar is 11 feet. This had 
been eredted by one of the Earls of Strathmore, probably Earl Patrick, as 
there is another built by him exactly refembling it at Glammis. This Crofs 
was taken down fome years ago, and is now fee up upon a rocky eminence 
within the park of Caftle-Huntly, called Cromwell's Knowe (Knoll). 

This village is'fituated upon the ridge of a bank, through the middle of 
wh,ch the turnpike.road between Perth and Dundee runs from weft to eaft; 
and it lS remarkable, that on the north fide of the road, no water nor fpring 
B to be found, in pits funk (as fome fay) S o or 60 feet deep ; while, on the 
fouth fide, there are many wells very well fupplied with water.

Villages. — There are only two other places in this parifh 
which have the leaft claim to be called villages ; Kingoody, 
which belongs to Mr Mylne of Mylnefield, already men-, 
tioned ; and Lochtown, a fmall village belonging to Mr 
Haldane of Airthry. The reft can only be called hamlets., 
but they are numerous. 

Farm Houfes. — The farm houfes are very good ; many 
of them new within thefe twenty years. In general they 
are handfome ; two (lories high, with two fire rooms, a large 
light clofet, and other conveniences, on each floor, and 
covered with blue or grey ilate. The dwelling-houfe is a 
little detached from, and advanced before the offices, form- 
ing one fide of a fquare ; the other three fides of which con- 
fift of offices. The barns forming the fide oppofite to the 
houfe, with a threfhing-mill behind ; and the other two 
iides are frables, byres, cart-fhades, granaries, bothie, &amp;c. ; 
and the dung-court }s in the centre of the fquare. The 
bothie is the apartment of the farm-fervants, where they 
fleep, drefs their ri&amp;uals and eat. 

Cajile-Huntly. — The moft remarkable building in the 
parifta is Caftle-Huntly. It ftands upon the point of a very 
lingular rock, which rifes in the middle of the plain, quite 
perpendicular towards the fouth-weft, and gradually Hoping 
to the eaftward. When it was originally built, as there is 
no date upon any part of the old caftle, is unknown ; but 
there is a charter in poffeffion of the family of Gray, to 
whom this eftate then belonged, and which made a part of 
very extenfive pcvTeffions in this country, which belonged 
to that family at the time •, which charter is from James II. 
in 1452, to Andrew the 2d Lord Gray of Foulis, giving 
him leave to build a fortalice upon any of his eftates, which 
were then very extenfive. In confequence of which, he 



of Longf organ. 

is {aid " to have built this caftle upon a very remarkable 
" rock, a little to the fouth-weft of Forgund, and called it 
** Huntly." It does not appear why he gave it that name; 
but there is an adjoining field, and a bridge acrofs the rivu- 
let which runs through the park, both of which bear the 
name of Huntly. It is faid, that having married a daughter 
of the Earl of Huntly, he named his caftle in honour of his 
lady. It is entirely built of Kingoody Hone ; and the 
country people have a tradition, that the materials were all 
brought by water to the fpbt* Be that as it may, there is 
every appearance of this rock, at fome very diftant period, 
being warned, if not furrounded by water ; for river fand is 
found in great abundance all round it ; and if there be any 
foundation for this tradition, it is probable that there was a 
place of ftrength upon this rock many years before the 

There is another circumftance which adds weight to this 
conjecture. The fouth-weft face of the rock had been fo 
much wafted by the weather, or fome other more powerful 
caufe, that fometime between the year 1660 and 1670, or 
thereabouts* Earl Patrick had judged it neceffary to build a 
facing, or mafly buttrefs, to cover the rock to the weft- 
ward, to protect that fide of the caftle. This buttrefs is 
very diftinguiftiable from the reft of the building of the 
caftle, and is eafily known to be Earl Patrick's, from the 
correfponding ftyle of building with his other works : Now, 
it is hardly probable, that from the year 1452 to 1660, a 
diftance only of 208 years, fo great a wafte could have been, 
made upon the face of a whin rock, by the common opera- 
tion of wind and weather, as to make fuch a facing necef- 
fary •, and if fo, efpecially as the eftate had been long in the 
family before, the probability is, that the original building 
had been much mo're ancient, and that it had only been re- 
paired,- 



476 Statijlical Account 

paired, perhaps enlarged, and its name changed, by theLorcf 
Gray, who obtained the charter from James II. * 

Sold 

* The molt ancient part of this caftle had been an oblong fquare, built 
upon the moft projecting part of the rock, in fuch fajhion, that the firft fet 
of apartments, confuting of three vaults, all arched with ftrong mafonry, 
had one end folid rock, and the other a wall of 14 feet thick, with a win- 
■ do-wto each, about 6 inches wide and 4 feet high. In the middle vault 
there had been a well, which is now filled up. 

Oppofite to the fouthermoft vault, the rock projects a little farther to the 
weftward, and is lower than the reft, upon which the pit or prifon was 
built; alfo T4 feet thick walls, and a narrow flit of a window; no paflage 
to the pit but by a trap door, and over it, a fquare apartment of 20 feet 
high,- arched at top, with a window of 4 feet fquare, and 38 feet from the 
ground, which is fuppofed to have been the guard-room, the only door of 
which is arched ; and there was not the ieaft veftige of any other way to 
get accefs to the caftle, even for one man at a time, but over the flielving 
rock on the fouth-weft, and- clofe by the two windows in the other two 
arched apartments, one of which is exactly upon the door, calculated, as it 
would appear, for the ufe of fpears, or other offenfive weapons, to prevent 
the entrance of an enemy. From all which, it would appear to have been 
as fecure a retreat, in thofe days, as nature and art could make it. This 
door had been built up, probably when Earl Patrick repaired the caftle, 
and another, on the north -eaft fide, had been ftruck out at that time, to 
make the accefs more convenient. On opening that old door in 1777, a very 
large iron-gate was found inclofed in a 10 feet wall, built of folid mafonry. 
To make the caftle ltill more fecure, it appears, that the original builders 
had left no other way of getting to the apartments above, after pafling the 
flielving rock, clofe by the two narrow windows of the lower vaults, but 
through the guard-room ; and then, by a hole of about 3 feet fquare in the 
top of one of the arches, to which they muft mount by a ladder, which, 
though built up, is perfectly diftinct at this day. It is probable, that after 
mounting, the Ladder was drawn up, and the Lord of the caftle flept in fe- 
turity. 

It would alfo appear, that fome time or other there had been fome kind 
of xcavations round part of the caftle, probably to lerve as a ditch for de- 
fence ; for, in 1780, when finking a foundation for fome addition to tl e 
prefent building, for about 12 feet deej) and upwards, it appeared to have 
b«cn filled up with wood allies, and rubbifli of various materials ; fo that, 

finding

Soldr/t 1615 to the Family of Lyon. — In 1 61 5, this caftle, 
with the eftate belonging to it, palled from the family of 
Gray to the family of Lyon, then Earls of Kinghorn, and 
Earl Patrick fucceeding fometime about the year 1660, it 
became a favourite reiidence of his. Whether any altera- 
tions had been made upon the caftle before his time, doe* 
not appear. But many alterations and additions were made 
by him, all of which bore his initials, and the date 1667. 
One very remarkable alteration made by him was enlar- 
ging the dining-room, by digging four feet out of the front 
wall for its whole length of 34 feet ; fo that, while the wall 
of the rooms, both above and below, are 10 feet thick, the 
front wall of this room is only 6 feet thick ; and when the 
caftle was repairing in 1778, the upper part of this exca- 
vation was found to project and. hang over, like a folid im- 
penetrable rock. 

Name changed to Lyon in 1672. — By the fame charter, 
which Earl Patrick obtained from Charles II. 1672, in 

favour 

finding no proper bed to found upon, arches were thrown from point to point 
of the rock for that purpofe. As no coal-afhes were found, may not this be 
an additional proof of its great antiquity ? 

The molt ancient part of the building is very diftinguifhable from the reft, 
as all the ftones are placed on the fame bed as they lay in the quarry ; and 
it would appear from the openings made on the walls,- for different pur- 
pofcs, by the prefent proprietor, that the old caftle had been built of two 
walls, one outride, of very large maffy ftones, tolerably well dreffed; and an 
inner wall, not quite fo well drefled : That the middle fpace between 
thefe had then been filled up with immenfe large whin-ftones, gathered 
from the fields, with fmaller ftones thrown in loofely round them, and then 
filled up with grouted lime, that is,.limc mixed with a proper proportion of 
fand, and made fo thin with water, as to admit of being poured in, and to 
fill up all the cavities between the ftones. This cement is now'fo very hard, 
that it is much more difficult to work than any quarry ; fo much fo, that in 
1793, when making an opening for a window of 9$ feet by 4* and only 
6 feet thick, as the wall had been thinned before, it was hard work to four 
ltout men for nine days.

favour of Longforgan, the barony was ere&amp;ed into a Lord- 
fliip, to be called the Lordlhip of Lyon ; and it is mod pro- 
bable that this was the sera of its change of name from 
Caftle-Huntly to Caftle Lyon. 

He alfd planted a great number of trees of all forts, many 
of which now remain, and the whole grounds were dreffed 
up in all the grandeur of fummer houfes, ftatues, avenues, 
gates, ornamented with various orders of architecture, &amp;.c. 
&amp;c. agreeable to the tafte of the times. 

Sold again in 1 777. — Nothing feems to have been done 
to this place fince Earl Patrick's time, until the prefent pro- 
prietor purchafed the eftate in 1777. The whole has now 
aflumed a new face. The grounds are laid out as much in 
the modern tafte as their lituation will admit; many trees 
are taken down, but many more have been planted, and 
great numbers of fine old horfe ehefnuts, planes, limes, and 
afh, &amp;c. in ftraight avenues, ftill remain, fo as to preferve 
the unity of ftyle between the place and the caftle. 

The caftle alfo, although completely modernifed within, 
has aflumed even a more caftellated appearance outwardly 
than formerly. The wingsy embattled walls, round tower, 
and corner turrets, have been given it by the prefent pro- 
prietor ; who has reftored the ancient name of Huntly, by 
which it Was fo long known While in poffeffion of the fami- 
ly of Gray. Its greateft height is 116 feet from the 
ground. 

View. — The view from the top of Caftle-Huntly is per- 
haps one of the fineft in Great Britain. Situated in the 
middle, and riling 116 feet above the level of one of the 
richeft and moft fertile plains in the ifland, it commands a 
view of the river Tay for above 20 miles, which, in many 
places is two miles broad and upwards, and which is fre- 
quently

quently covered with a great number of veffels of various 
burdens. On the fouth, the hills of Fife bound the profped, 
now in moft places highly cultivated ; and on the north, a 
continuation of the Sidlaws, covered with rich corn-fields to 
their fummits ; and the whole well wooded, and interfperfed 
with gentlemens feats, villages, hamlets, and farm-houfes, 
for above 30 miles; and in the back ground are feen diftant 
hills for 60 mijes and upwards. 

Gate.- —The gate is very remarkable, and had originally 
been built by Earl Patrick, at the weft end of Longforgan, 
which he named Port-Patrick, after himfelf ; but which, 
from a vulgar corruption, was always called Port-Patience 
It was one of fix, which he built in a ftraight line, upon the 
approach between Longforgan and the caftle. It confifts 
of a middle fpace of 16 feet wide, and an arch on each fide 
of 7 feet. The whole length 72 feet 6 inches. It is orna- 
mented on both fides with Tufcan femicolumns, and crown- 
ed with four pyramids, It was taken down about twelve 
years ago, andxebuilt, with great care, where it now ftands, 
as a lafting monument of the tafte of the Noble Earl by 
whom it was originally built. 

Brimmie. — In this parifh, alfo, there is a feat belonging 
to Lord Kinnaird, called Drimmie, which became the refi- 
dence of the family, in confequence of the caftle of Moncur 
having been burnt down in the beginning of this century. 
It originally confifted of a lodge built as a banqueting- 
room, in order to facilitate conviviality with the then pro- 
prietors of the eftate of Caftle-Huntly ; and to this lodge 
additions have been made from time to time, as neceflity 
diftated ; but its fituation is fo little calculated for becom- 
ing a fit refidence for the family, that no regular plan ap- 
pear? ever to have been adopted for beautifying, or laying 

out

out the grounds, confequently there is nothing about it 
worth notice. 

The prefent proprietor has this year, 1795, made fome 
confiderable repairs about the houfe, for the pur.pofe of ren- 
dering it a more comfortable abode, until a. fit and fuitable 
family refidence mail be built, in a park not far diftant, in 
the adjoining parilh of Rome, which ;his Lordfhip has inclo- 
fed at a great expence, and is of confiderable extent, con- 
taining in it great variety of ground, plantations, water, &amp;c. 
all of which have been improved with, much coff and tafte ; 
thus that which requires the hand of time to render perfedt, 
being fo far completed, a houfe fit for fo fine a fituation and 
place may be ere&amp;ed, whenever it may fuit the inclination 
or convenience of the family. — The eftate of^Drimmie has 
been in the poffeflion of the family of Kinnaird for many 
centuries.

Mylnefield. — The houfe of Mylnefield is beautiful! v fi- 
tuated, eaft from Longforgan, and.fouth of the turnpike- 
road leading to Dundee, upon the rifing ground on the eaft 
corner of the parifh. The grounds are laid out in great 
tafte by Mr White. It has a great deal of planting, both 
old and young, about it, and commands a moft delig'itful 
profpect of the river Tay, the diftant hills of File, and 
beautiful rich bank of Gray, Lundie, &amp;.c. in the county of 
Forfar. It is furrounded with fine grafs parks, from which 
the Dundee market is fupplied with excellent mutton. 

Old Church. — The parifh church, manfe, and fchool- 
houfe, are in the village of Longforgan. 

The church was taken down 1794. It was an old, long, 
narrow, and inconvenient building, confifting of two parts, 
and evidently built at very different periods. The eaft- 
rnoft, which belonged entirely to the eftate of Caftle-Hunt- 



of Longf organ. 4 3r 

ly, was a fubftantial building, all of afhlar Kingoody ftone ; 
and from a very handfome crols on the eaft gavel, and feve- 
ral receffes of hewn ftone within, probably for altars, or 
fhrines of fome favourite faints, it had every appearance of 
having been the original church when the Roman Catholic 
religion prevailed ; and from uniformity of building with 
the church of Fowlis Eafter, it is probable that both were 
built fometime in the twelfth century, by the fame Lady 
tJray, to whom bbth eftates then belonged* The weft end 
of the church, although apparently older, muft have been 
of a much later date. It was a very infufiicient building, 
of bad materials, and had every appearance of that ill- 
judged parfimonious fimplicity, fo much afFe&amp;ed by the en* 
thufiaftic firft reformers'. This, therefore, would appear to 
have been added to it at the Reformation. 

Steeple.— Upon the weft end of the church is the fteeple, 
which was built by Earl Patrick of Strathmore about 130 
years ago. It has three bells and a clock, which laft is the 
property of the inhabitants of the village ; but it is not well 
kept. On the eaft end is a fquare building, alfo built by 
his Lordfhip. It ftands diagonally, and was formerly joined 
to the church, but they are now diftinft buildings. The 
lower part is the Caftle-Huntly burylng-place, and over it 
is a room, to which the family ufed to retire during the in- 
terval ot dxvine fervice. This room the proprietor has rf.

4^2 Statiftical Account 

Manfe. — The manfe was built 1753, and has been twic« 
repaired within thefe 15 years. In 1795, it got a thorough 
repair for the third time, and is now a mod excellent con- 
venient houfe ; it has very good offices, all lately repaired, 
a good garden, and is beautifully fituated, commanding a 
moil exceniive view of the river Tay, and the rich grounds 
beiow. 

Stipend. — The ftipend is 11 bolls of wheat, ^6 bolls of 
barley, 57 bolls of oats, 2 bolls of meal, and 20 Sterling, 
befides a good glebe, worth L. 10 Sterling per annum at 
leaft •, fo that, with the houfe, garden, and offices, it is worth 
about L. 150 per annum, taken at a medium of 10 years 
back •, but from an old practice, the vi&amp;ual part of mini- 
fter's ftipends is valued fo low, it makes them appear much 
lefs than they are in facT: ; although, were they ftated as 
they really are, the livings of the clergy in Scotland are in 
general fufficiently moderate, and many of them much lower 
than they ought to be. 

Plan for improving Minijlers Stipends. — It would be a 
good plan, were Government to make an offer to proprie- 
tors to purchafe their teinds, which, it is believed, moft 
would do. This would raife a very large capital ; and were 
the produce put in the hands of truftees, under the diredion 
of the Church, to be lent out by them to the beft advantage, 
and to empower them to buy land if they thought proper, 
to be applied folely and entirely to pay the minifters fti- 
pends, and to uphold the church and manfe, a permanent 
fund would be eftabliflied immediately, to accommodate 
the parifhes with more becoming places of worQiip, to lodge 
the minifters more commodiouuy, and alfo, to make many 
livings much better 5 and might, in time, be the means of 
making ftipends keep pace with the value of money. This 



of Long f organ. 483 

is but the outlines of a plan, which may, indeed, be liable 
to objections ; but the advantages would be fo great, it feems 
to merit confideration. The ftipends would ftill be unequal, 
according to circumftances ; but, by proper regulation, all 
of them might be better : The clergy would then be raifed 
to that rank and confideration in fociety to which they are 
well entitled; and men of learning and abilities would con- 
fider the Church as an objedr. of honourable ambition : He- 
ritors would no longer have caufe of difputes wirh their 
paftors ; and the Court of Teinds, with a thoufand &amp;.cs. 
might be fet afide for ever. 

Schoolhoufe, Schoolmajler' s Salary, ifc. and School. — The 
fchoolhoufe is very tolerable, with a houfe for the mailer 
attached to it. The fixed falary for the fchoolmaflcr is 
L. 7, 5 s. per annum; but that the parifh might be well fup- 
plied, the heritors, at the fettlement of the prefent teacher, 
raifed the falary, by fubfcription, to about L. 20 per annu?n y 
to continue during his incumbency. The average number 
of fcholars' are about 80 or 90 ; and the fees for teaching 
Latin are 2 s. 6 d. ; writing and arithmetic, 2 s. •, and 1 s. 6 d. 
for teaching to read Englifh, per quarter ; which, with fome 
fmall fees as feflion-clerk, and Mr Paterfon's yearly allow- 
ance for poor fcholars, makes thefplace worth more than 
L. 50 per annum. 

The fchool may be confidered to be more immediately 
under the patronage of Mr Paterfon, the principal heritor; 
who, befides taking a very active part, and fubfcribing very 
liberally himfelf, he pays for teaching twelve fcholars, chil- 
dren of fuch poor as cannot pay the ufual fees ; and every 
year, upon the examination of the fchool by the prefbytery 
of Dundee, he attends himfelf, when in the country, and 
gives premiums of Bibles, New Teftaments, Collections, 
account-books, pens, and paper, to be diftributed by the 

examiners

examiners to fuch of the fcholars of each clafs, as they may 
think molt deferving ; and as all the fcholars know this to 
be an annual eftablifhed practice, it has had an exceeding 
good efFfft, and has raifed a fpiritof emulation, and that de- 
gree of application amongft the children, which cannot fail 
of giving great pleafure to all concerned. 

State of the Poor. — The ftate of the poor in Scotland is, 
in every refpedt, quite different from what it is in England. 
There is a kind of very commendable pride, which pre- 
vents many of the labouring poor in this country from ac- 
cepting parifh charity, as long as by their own induftry, or 
by the bounty of their friends, they can get a morfel of 
bread. In moft pariflies, the ordinary funds are fufficient 
to fupply the wants of their poor : Thefe are principally 
Under the management of the minifter and the kirk-feffion, 
who muff, be well acquainted with the circumftances of every 
one ; but mould the ordinary funds prove infufficient, the 
care of the poor falls to the heritors. This has happened in 
fome parifhes ; and hence, fomething like a rate, or pro- 
portional afleflment, has taken place ; but in this parifh 
there is nq fuch thing. 

jFunds. — The funds are, L. 230, at intereft at 5 per 

cent. — — ' L. 11 10 a

ding what is given at the Sacrament, may

and- 80 fitters, to the kirk-feffion, for the benefit of the 
poor*. 

Number of Poor. — There are only ia perfons who are 
upon the feffion-Iift, (November 1795), and who receive 
about L. 2, 8 s. per month 5 fo that the funds of the parifli 
are quite fufficient for fuch ordinary fupplies ; but at pre- 
fent, the feffion have to pay L. 6 per annum + to the Lunatic 
I$ofpital at Moutrofe, for a poor woman difordered in mind ; 
and in the year 1795, as there was an appearance of fcarcity, 
from the deficiency of the crop, the feffion came to a refo- 
lution to give all their refident poor meal inltead of money 5 
and to every perfon entitled to 1 s. to give in its place one 
peck of good oatmeal. 

Extraordinary Supply 1795. — However, crop 1795 was 
found to be fo very deficient, particularly in the Carfe of 
Gowrie, that before February 1796, there was every ap- 
pearance, not only of fcarcity, but of want, and which would 
probably have been the cafe in this parilh, had not the he- 
ritors exerted themfelves in an extraordinary degree ; Mr 
Mylne of Mylnefield, and Mr Wemyfs of Lauriefton, who 
had oats, took charge of their own tenants ; but as Lord; 
Kinnaird and Mr Paterfon had neither oats nor meal of 

their 

* The leaft reflection ought to convince every one, that it is of the utmofr. 
confequence to fociety to keep off a rate as long as poflible; for although 
there are many who will exert themfelves to the utmoft, rather than accept 
of parifli charity, yet, when they know that a fund is eftabliflied for their 
aid, they are inclined, from that moment, to confider it as their right: fliame 
is entirely laid afide ; their jnduftriuus endeavours to fupport themfelves are 
at an end 5 and they become burden upon the parifli at a much earlier pe- 
riod than they are entitled to in the true fpirit of charity^

their own, they fent from London 400 quarters of the heft 
meahng Englifh oats, which they diretfed to be ground into 
meal, to be fold at the Dundee market price to all of their 
tenants who wanted, and who could afford to pay ; and to 
thofe, whofe daily earning were not fufficient to maintain 
themfelves and family, they ordered the meal to be given 
out weekly at a reduced price, I e . at 1 s. per peck, and to 
continue till next harveft ; and to the poor for nothing. 

Fw Poor.— It may feem extraordinary, that in a parifh 
confifting of 1500 fouls and upwards, and in which there is 
a village of nearly half the number, principally labourers 
and manufacturers, there are fo few who receive chari- 
ty; and Hill more extraordinary that there is but one 
travelling beggar in the whole parifh ; even lhe receives 
parochial fupplies, but fhe has got fuch a habit of begging, 
nothing can refhain her. Of that clafs, many pafs through 
the parifh, but they come from the neighbouring towns, and 
many from the Highlands. This may be* accounted for as 
follows : 

Reafotis vuhy. — Every native of this parifh, who is in real 
want, upon proper application, gets a fupply as far as the 
funds will admit, and according to his or her neceffities. 

If they be totally unable to do any thing for their own 
maintenance, or if they have a family to provide for, which 
they are unable to do, they get more ; if they be fingie, or if 
they have friends or relations who can help them, they get teis. 
For it is the leading feature of this charity, that the poor are 
to be fupplied with the necefTaries of life, and not with the 
fuperfluities, and in fuch a manner as to be a fpur to the in- 
duftxy of all, efprcially of the rifing generation, and not to 
encourage floth, and fupport idlenefs and extravagance. 

As

As this is a corn country ; as improvements in agriculture, 
to an immenfe extent, have been carrying on within thefe 
30 years ; as there is one of the belt ft one-quarries in Great 
Britain in this parifh, which employs a great number of 
hands ; as numbers of buildings have been going on ; and 
turnpike -roads, with many other public works, there is, of 
courfe, a great demand for labourers of every defcription , and 
of all ages; even women and children get conftant employ- 
ment in the field for near 3-4ths of the year, befides what are 
required for the manufactures and different trades* It is in the 
winter months only, that the labouring and induftrious poor 
run the greateft rifle of want. At that period, therefore, 
the heritors are Very attentive to the wants of the '•poor J 
and as the village of Longforgan belongs entirely to Caftle- 
Huntly, during the three winter months, i.e. December, 
January, and February, or longer, if the feafon be fevere, „ 
Mr Paterfon orders meal to' be diftributed to the poor on his 
eftate, one or two pecks per week, or more, according to 
their neceffities. or as the number and helplefs condition of 
their families may require. By fuch means the parifh of 
Longrorgan has hitherto been able to fupport its own poor, 
w hout a rate upon thernfelves, or a tax upon the benevo* 
lence of their neighbours. 

Population. — The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, amount- 
ed only to i 285 and as the number at prelent is 1526, con- 
iequently there is an increafe of 241 ; of thefe, 778 are

Salubrity. — This parifh is in general healthy, nor is there 
any difeafe endemical to the diftricl:. Formerly, in the low 
carfe, agues prevailed, Now, fince the ditches have been 
deepened, and the lands fo completely drained of water, the 
difeafe is fcarcely known. Fevers are not frequent, which 
may be owing to the regular diet of the inhabitants : 
While young, the ploughmen and labourers are fubject to 
colds, which, in ftrong conftitutions, and in a more advanced 
age, generally terminate in rheumatifms, and gouty pains* 
as the country people call them ; but, in others, it falls 
upont their breafts ; their lungs become affe&amp;ed, and, in gene- 
ral, fuch complaints end fatally. This termination general- 
ly happens in fcrophulous habits, which are very prevalent, 
particularly amongft the weavers and common people of 
this neighbourhood. "Within thefe 20 years, one iftftance 
has happened, of a hydrops pectoris, in a ftrong healthy 
man above jo, who caught cold from geting wet fowing 
his corn in the fpring, which was followed with a flriclure 
in his bread, and difficulty of breathing : Soon after his 
legs fwelled, which gradually rofe upwards, evidently drop- 
fical and in a fhort time ; after every medical help had fail- 
ed, it proved fatal. A healthy young woman, who had 
never been farther out of the parifh than Dundee, was 
feized with an inflammation of the liver : The difeafe was

For many years paft, difeafes have been more frequent 
in the hilly part of the parifh than in the Carfe. This had

many fubmitted to it thankfully, when ftrongly recommend- 
ed to them fome years ago •, but for fome time paft it feems 
to have been forgotten. 

Mode of Living.- The Inhabitants of this parifli are in gene- 
ral induftrious, quiet and fober ; fome of them very intelligent 
in their profeffions ; many of the better fort live exceeding- 
ly well ; their tables are abundantly fupplied with every ne- 
ceffary, and fome with the luxuries of life. In general, 
the farmers are well lodged, and both they and their fami- 
lieb are well dreffed. The leffer farmers and manufacturers 
alfo live well, and have plenty of good wholefome food ; 
many of them are fupplied with butcher-meat at times ; and 
both they and the labourers, not only ufe oat-meal and po- 
tatoes, with the produce of their yards or gardens, but they 
frequently ufe wheaten bread, the confumption of which 
has increafed much within thefe few years, and there are 
very few who have families, - who do not ufe tea and its 
accompanyments. 

Farm Servants. — The farm fervants formerly lived with 
the family ; and their ufual food was broth made of kail 
and barley, or grotts, (unhulked oats), without meat, and 
bannocks made of peafe and bean meal. Now they live 
apart from the family in their bothie, and get what is call- 
ed livery meal, i. e. 2 pecks of oat-meal per week, and 
3 choppins (quarts) of lkimmed milk per day.

Some attempts have lately been made to introduce Jaco- 
bine principles into this parifti ; but by care, attention, and 
proper exertion of the heritors, in fupport of the country 
police, it is hoped that the idle, the unprincipled, and ill- 
difpofed, will be effe&amp;ually prevented from difturbing the 
public peace ; and that the good fenfe of the inhabitants in 
general, who are loyal and well-difpofed, will teach others 
to put a proper value upon that moll excellent Conftitution, 
under which all enjoy fo many bleflings. 

Increafe of Population. — That the inhabitants of the pa- 
rifli are in general upon the increafe, when compared with 
Dr Webfter's return, has been already obferved, notwith- 
ftanding that feveral cottages, and one confiderable village, 
have been removed, to make room for larger farms. It is 
in the villages, however, that the addition has principally 
taken place. Bv a furvey taken of the village of Long- 
forgan in 1775, there were then only 105 families in it; 
there are now 126. Twenty-one families make 105 per- 
fons at five a family, equal to nearly one-fixth of the whole 
number. 

Fuel. — The fuel Gommonly ufed by the inhabitants of 
this parifh is coal, brought by water-carriage from the Frith 
of Forth, and landed at Dundee, the burn-mouth of Inver- 
gourie, or at Polgavie \ the medium price ufed to be 4 s. per 
boll, of 56 (lone Amflerdam weight, that is, about 6 d. per 
cwt.; but within thefe few years the price has rifen to 
5 s. and upwards. This has introduced the ufe of Englifli 
coal from Newcaftle and Sunderland, which are now 
much liked, and by many thought better, and in the 
end cheaper. They alfo burn whins, (furz), and weedings 
of firs, but their dependence is upon coal. 



Horfes.

Statistical Account 



Horfes. — There are in this parifti about 347 horfes; of which 
ten or twelve at moft are riding or carriage horfes ; the reft 
are all for the purpofes of agriculture. There are fomc 
few brood mares, but not one ftallion ; and although fome 
few horfes are bred here, yet the principal fupply is from 
the weft country markets. 

Cattle. — There are about 900 cows and black cattle in 
this parifti. The cows are of various breeds, and of all 
fiz.es; and although many calves are brought up, yet there 
is perhaps too little attention fliown to this fpecies of farm- 
ing- 

It has been a practice here with many farmers to take in 
black-cattle from the higher lands, about the end of the 
year, /. e. after Martinmas, and put them in their ftraw- 
yard, where they continued, and got nothing but ftraw 
through the winter, thefe were called winterens, and ufually 
paid from 6s. to 10 s. per head, according to the fize. It 
was formerly a practice in this parifti to ufe oxen in the 
plough ; but now there is no fuch thing in the whole pa- 
rilh, except on the eftate of Littletown ; and though they 
may be bred to go well either in the plough or cart, per- 
haps to as good purpofe as horfes, are much more eafily 
kept up, and when unfit for the farm can be fed to great 
advantage, and will fetch a good price from the butcher ; 
yet it is found, that they are not fo fit for the purpofes of 
farming in this country, as their feet are too tender, even 
when well £hod, for much work ; and much carting upon 
hard roads lays them up entirely. 

Sheep. — There are no fheep in this parifti, but fuch as 
are kept for the ufe of families, except upon the eftate of 
Mylnefield. Mr Mylne keeps about 400 of the Bakewell 
breed, and as near the original ftock as he can procure. 

Thefc

Thefe he prefers to every other kind. He thinks that 
they fatten much fooner than the black-faced. He is much 
inclined to think that the fame field will fatten as many of 
the one kind as of the other ; and he is convinced, that the 
quantity of mutton produced on the acre is certainly at lead 
25 per cent, in favour of the poled flieep. Belides, as his 
farm is partly corn, and partly grafs, the poled flieep are 
fo quiet, and fo little difpofed to ramble, that they are in. 
every refpect. preferable for fuch farms to the black-faced, 
who are fo wild that no fence can keep them within bounds; 
confequently, the lofs which may be fuftained, from their ' 
rambling difpofition upon fuch a farm, is beyond all calcu- 
lation. But the Iheep kept for gentlemens families are the 
black- faced wedders, brought from the Highlands at four 
years old, if they can be had. They thrive well ; and, 
when fed, weigh from 16 to 20 lb. per quarter, and are ex- 
cellent mutton. There are alfo fome Dorfetfliire ewes for 
early lambs, which have been fold in the Dundee market, 
in January and February, at a guinea and 20 s. each. 

Calves. — Calves are fed in this parifh, and particularly 
at CafllcHuntly, for veal, fully as good as any in England, 
They are fed in a box, which is made of any coarfe boards, 
4t or 5 feet long, 4 or 44 high, and about 2 feet wide, in 
proportion to the breed to be fed. The boards of which 
the box is made, are to be put fo clofe to one another, as to 
let m fufficient air, but no more, as the exclufion of 
light may be one effential part of the procefs. It ftands up- 
on 4 feet ; at one end about 4 inches high ; and the other 2 
inches ; which, with fmall holes in the bottom, drains it of 
all wetnefs. But, to make it ftill more comfortable, the 
bottom mould be covered with ftraw or hay, which lhould 
be changed at leaft twice a week. The calf is put into this 
box when new dropped, or as foon alter as poffible ; and 

for 



49^ Statiflical Account 



for the firft week milk mould be given it cautioufly ; after 
which it may be given more freely ; and when about ten 
days old it mould be bled. It may then get as much fweet 
milk, frefh from the cow, as it can take, three times a-day ; 
and a large piece of chalk mould be hung in the box, 
which it will lick occafionally. The bleeding mould be re- 
peated once a week, and it will be fine veal in ten weeks. 
It mould never be killed fooner, but three months, or 
even older, the veal will be excellent, and will weigh 
from 10 to ii ftone, of 16 lb. each. The frequent bleed- 
ing prevents difeafes from plethora, which calves are fub- 
je£l to, even when not fo high fed; and ftill more when 
they are. And the chalk contributes nothing to the 
whitenefs of the veal, but it amufes the animal, and it cor- 
rects the acidity in the ftomach, which might otherwife 
happen, and which frequently does happen. At all times 
when they loath the milk, and do not feed well, let them 
be bled. A cow calf is the beft for veal. If a bull calf, 
he mould be cut at about a week old, otherwife the real 
will neither be fo good nor fo white. 

Pigs. — Pigs are in general to be found in the farm-yards 
of proprietors only. Thofe in this parifh are moftly, if not 
all, of the Chinefe breed, which are never meafly ; but 
fometimes they lofe the ufe of their feet, of which they 
feldom recover. They are very prolific, and eafily brought 
up ; they pick up their food in a ftraw-yard, or about the 
doors, and live upon what otherwife would be loft. They 
may be fed upon clover, yams, potatoes, or the refufe of the 
kitchen, and will fatten upon damaged corn; but if Ihut 
up for eight or ten days, and fed upon ground peafe or 
beans, at a very fmall expence, they become excellent 
meat at all ages ; indeed all their corn mould be ground ; 
very fine is not neceffary 5 but if well bruifed between

jroliers, or broken in a mill, it will be found by experience, 
that much lefs will nourifli, and even fatten pigs, as well as 
all animals of every fpecies ufually fed upon corn. There- 
fore, to breed pigs about a farm, and to feed all beftial upon 
bruifed grain, inftead of whole corn, are really great im- 
provements in agricultural economy but the practice is 
not general here ; and the country people ftill retain fome 
prejudice againfl: pork ; but it is wearing out gradually. 

Poultry.— -Poultry of all kinds are bred in this parilhj 
turkeys, geefej ducks, hens, &amp;cc. ; but the fowls are certainly 
much fewer in number lince the practice of letting large 
farms began. All the fmall farmers, acre-men, and every 
village-houfe, formerly paid fo many fowls (kain) as a part 
of their rent, which was a mean of keeping up the breed, 
not only for the fupply of the country round, but alfo to 
anfwer the demand of the market-towns in the neighbour- 
hood. Now, the villagers pay none, as it was a conftant 
caufe of difpute with the farmers, and evert amongft them- 
felves. However, mofl of the great farmers pay kain, al- 
though they are very averfe to the practice. But the land- 
lords infill upon it, as the only means of preferving the 
breed from total extinction \ at the fame time, many far- 
mers throw the burden upon their cottars, artd make therii 
pay the kain as part of their houfe-rent. In all old leafes it 
made a part of the agreement, that fo many capons mould 
be paid annually, as part of the kain, and then they were in 
plenty; but as they have not been exacted for fome time, 
now there is fcarce a capon to be found in the country. 

Pigeons. — There are eight dove-cots, or pigeon-houfes, in 
the parilh. The pigeons are exceedingly fine ; but they are 
a very expenfive delicacy to the farmer; yet they are of 
fome advantage, for their dung, either mixed with chaff, or 
not, and fown upon the furface, and either harrowed in with

the feed, or fuffered to lie, efpecially if the weather be moift 
and wet, makes a moft excellent top-dreffing for any crop. 

Game. — There are plenty of hares, partridges, plovers, 
and fnipes. The two laft are much diminished in number, 
imce the marfhy grounds were drained fo completely. The 
land-rail is often heard, but feldom feen. Wuodcocks alfo 
take this parifh in their rout, and are exceeding fine. Some 
years ago there was a confiderable colony of herons in this 
parifh : They occupied a circle of fir-trees which furrounded 
an old building, near a piece of marfhy ground, upon the 
eftate of Caftle-Huntly ; but when the grounds were drain- 
ed, and the trees cut down, the herons hovered about the 
place a year or two, and then emigrated entirely. There 
are a great number of crows, (rooks), particularly about 
Caltle-Huntly, where they have fpoiled the beautiful tops 
of many full grown trees. They are alfo very deftru&amp;ive 
to young plantations, to potatoes, peafe, and beans, when 
they firft b*Sgin to fhew themfelves above ground, and per- 
haps to other grain alfo ; but as they devour grubs, and 
other pernicious infefts, it is not improbable but they do 
more real good than ill to the farmer. There are alfo car- 
rion crows, (hoddies, as they are called here), and hawks, 
but not very numerous. There are great numbers of hedge- 
hogs found in this parifh. 

Foxes. — Foxes alfo fometimes come down from the plant- 
ings upon the hills, and pay unwelcome vifits to the poultry- 
yards ; and fome winters, a ftrolling red-deer has now artd 
then made its appearance, even iii the low grounds of this 
parifh. 

The furface of this parifh is various ; what lies next the 
river is car fa * clay ; the fouthern declivities of the hills con-

fill, for the mod part, of rich black loam. Some parts 
are covered with a foil of a particular reddifh colour, but 
very prolific when well dreffed ; the country people call it 
mortar, u e. a kind of clay mixed with gravel, and very dif- 
ferent from carfe clay. The upper part of the parifti is of 
a very inferior quality. 

About 40 years ago, not half the clay grounds in this 
parifh were fubjeft to the plough ; the ridges were broad, 
unequal and crooked, and their crowns only were arable, 
between which a broad fpace, which they called a hauh y 
and which confided of half of each ridge at leafl, was left in 
natural grafa, upon which the farmers paftured cattle, and 
which, in winter, was generally covered with water ; even 
the furface of thefe bauks was pared off, and Ibid for build- 
ing and covering houfes ; and the farmer confidered his di- 
vots, i. e. the pared furface, as an article of profit. Clover 
and fallow were then unknown ; and the clay between For- 
gan and the river, which is now the richeft part of the pa- 
riih, was then fo poor, and fo unproductive, that tenants 
could fcarce be got upon any terms ; the befl of it fcarcely 
yielding double feed. Every encouragement therefore was 
given ; the grounds were drained and fenced at the land- 
lords expence, who alfo gave lime, on leafes for 38 years, to 
enable the tenants to improve the land, and indemnify 
themfelves for -labour and expence. At prefent, the 
ridges in the clay are ftill in moft places unequal and crook- 
ed, as it is exceedingly difficult to change their direction, 
without very materially injuring the land, and not poffible 
but at a great expence ; but the whole furface is quite dry, 
and the water effectually carried off by means of deep 
ditches round and through every farm. There are no 
bauks ; but the whole is highly cultivated, well limed, and 
i?.ept in good heart by proper management and a regular 

rotation

rotation of cropping ; of which clover and fallow always 
make a part. 

General Imfir.ovemcnts.-ln 1760, a piece of uncultivated 
moor ran acrofs the whole parifh from weft to eaft, confid- 
ing of between 500 and 600 acres, and yielding nothing but 
heath, broom or whin (furze). In 1761, it was divided by fub- 
rmffio n amqngft the adjoining proprietors, and now no part of 
it is uncultivated. About 200 acres of it are covered with fine 
thriving plantations of fir and lark, from 30 years old and 
upwards 5 about as much is under the plough, and the reft 
laid out in beautiful grafs parks, and makes part of the eftate 
of Mylnefield, improved by the prefent proprietor at a very 
great expence, almoft equal to a purchafe of the ground, but 
which is worth now from 40 s. to 45 s. per annum. 

That part of it which fell to the eftate of Caftle-Huntly, 
was either planted with fir, larix, and other trees, or let to 
tenants ; to fome of whom lime was given by the proprie- 
tor, at the rate of 45 bolls per acre *, and to others marl, at 
the rate of 50 bolls per acre f , to enable them to improve the 
ground. So that what was fcarce worth any thing before 
the divifion, twenty years ago, was let at 5 s. per acre, and 
now gives 20 s. and 25 s. and upwards. But the rife of 
sent was gradual, as the improvement of the land enabled 
the tenant to pay. 

Formerly the hills, and all the upper part of the parifh, 
were one continued uninclofed moorland furface, with 
fcarce a habitable houfe upon them. The proprietors then 
were either unable or unwilling to lay out money upon 
their eftates 4 , and were happy to get tenants who had mo- 
ney to fpend and a fpirit to improve ; therefore, to fuch, 
they were willing to give long leafes, as the only means, 
without expence to themfelves, of reimburfing the tenant 
for his time, trouble, and expence, while their eftates were 

improving

improving at the fame time. Several of thefe leafes are 
(1796) unexpired at this day. In 1767 two eftates were 
let in this parifli for three nineteen years, (57). They 
were at the time perfe&amp;ly open, uninclofed, and almoft un- 
cultivated, and the whole buildings upon both of little or 
no value. The tenant built new houfes, repaired the old 
ones, particularly a manfion-houfe on each, inclofed a great 
part with fubftantial ftone-dikes, (walls of dry ftone about 
4 or 5 feet high), and the reft with thorn-hedges, planted 
about 60 acres of trees of all forts, limed and marled and 
drained the whole grounds, which were then fpouty and 
wet, and by that means greatly improved the eftates ; fo 
that what was let, in 1767, at L. 152, 10 s. in 1784 was va- 
lued at L. 300 ; and now (1796) they yield a rent of L.360 
per annum and upwards. But thefe improvements were 
done at a very great expence by a fldlful farmer, who ap- 
plied the money with judgment. 

Another eftate, of about 300 acres, in 1777, brought a 
rent of L. 65, which now pays L. 305, befides 75 acres of 
very thriving plantations, which were at that time not 
worth more than 2 s. per acre on an average. They were 
valued lately by a nurferyman at L. 3375 Sterling. Their 
weedings yield about 10 s. per acre per annum ; and if they 
continue to thrive equally well, may, when fifty years old, 
be worth four times the fum. 

The eftate has alfo been improved at a great expence, by 
drefling the fields, inclofing them with good fences, build- 
ing mills upon the burn, (a fmall rivulet), which run* 
through the eftate, and alfo farm and cot-houfes. 

Another eftate in this parifli, purchafed within thefe few 
years, which was then perfectly open, and in very bad or- 
der, is now inclofed, with good ftone and thorn fences, well 
divided in handfome fields, and about 200 acres planted 
with all kinds o£ trees, which are in a very thriving condi- 
tion v

tion; fo that, now, its value is already doubled, if not 
more. 

About eighteen yeirs ago, in the Intermediate fpace be- 
tween the bank of Forgan and the clay, there were about 
20 acres of moraffy ground, called the Latch, fo much im- 
pregnated with water, that in many places it could not 
carry a horfe. To improve this, and render it arable, a 
deep ditch was dug along the bottom of the brae-land, (ri- 
fing ground), to cut off the fprings from above, and the 
fpace divided by crofs ditches, with another between it and 
the clay to carry off the water ; and now the whole is fine 
arable land, as *good as any clay foil in the carfe. It was 
let then at 5s. per acre; it is now worth from 50s. to 
L. 3 per acre. 

Embanking. — The cncroachmentsmade by the river Tay 
upon the Carfe, part of its boundaries, having made the pro- 
prietors of thefe lands think of embanking for their defence ; 
thelate Mr Crawford of Monorgan, who was the only heritor: 
in this parilh whofe lands were in danger, began to 1 n- 
bank about thirty years ago, and built ftjne-fences ac a ery 
great expence ; but being injudicioufly conftruct.d, and 
built of bad materials, they have required repair almoft e- 
very year. Now, fince Monorgan has been annexed to the 
eftate of Caftle-Huntly, the proprietor has begun to em- 
bank upon a new plan. He has cut the earth into Hoping 
banks, falling to its greateft height at an angle, everywhere 
much above 45 °, and paving the whole extent of the Hope 
as far as .the tide reaches, with good long ftones, with their 
ends inwards, and towards the land; fo that the waves 
Wafh over it, and, as they meet with no refinance, they do 
no injury. The expence of * this is no doubt considerable, 
but perhaps not much, if any thing, more than what has 
been dcie by other carfe proprietors along the banks of the 
liver, and bids fair to be infinitely more durable. However 

he 



of "Longf organ. 



he has this year tried to fence after another manner. He 
ha c drawn a line, within water-mark, at a confiderable di- 
fta.ice from the beach, and upon it laid down {tones, not 
built, nor very regular, but in fuch fort as to form a broad 
bafe, «nd to narrow gradually towards the top, and about 
5 6 feet high. This bulwark of ftones is expected to 
break the force of the flood-tide, even in ftormy weather, 
fo that it may beat with lefs violence againft the land ; and 
as in the reflux it will certainly caufe a confiderable fpace 
of dead water, a greater quantity of mud or fediment will 
be left behind, which, in time, will probably increafe fo 
much in bulk, and alfo in firmnefs, that reeds may be plant- 
ed with a probability of fuccefc ; and if they once are efta- 
bliihed, the fence will bid fair to be durable : Alfo at ano- 
ther place, where the river approaches nearer to the braes 
(high banks), he has dug a trench of about 3 feet deep, and 
as broad, the outfide nearly perpendicular, but perfectly co- 
vered with the beach ; the infide Hoping upwards to hu- 
mour the acclevity of the bank. In this trerich are 
thrown (tones, as regularly as it can be done by a common 
labourer, and, when the trench is full, more ftones are laid 
up, fo a3 to cover the face of the bank higher up than any 
tide flows. From the folidity of the foundation, and the 
gentlenefs of the acclivity, this alfo is expected to anfwer. 
If either of thefe do, they will fave much expence ; but of 
that experience mult judge. 

Levelling in Clay. — The ridges upon the clay part of the 
Mains of Caftle-Huntly were crooked, unequal, irregular, 
and liable in rainy feafons to be drenched with water, when 
M Paterfon got poflefllon of it in 1779. But he has levelled 
the whole, except one field, which does not require it fo 
much ; ftraighted all the ridges, roundtd them fufficiently 

to 



5°4 Statijlical Account 



to carry off the water, and no more, and made them all of 
18 feet broad. 

He made the firft attempt to level in a manner recom- 
mended by Dr Anderfon ; but he found it too difficult to 
execute, perhaps from not clearly undemanding the Doc 
tor's method, He therefore did the whole with the fpade- 
He firft opened a trench of about 10 feet wide, and extend- 
ing from end to end of the field, in the fame direction he 
meant to lay the ridges, laid up the upper furface of the 
lo feet trench upon the fide of the ditch, to be removed 
afterwards ; then made up all the low fpaces, or former fur- 
rows, with the underfoil, from the crowns or rifing grounds, 
with fpade-and wheel-barrow, if near, and if at a diftance] 
with carts. He raifed this trench with the underfoil, alfo 
brought from both ends, towards the middle of the field, in 
fuch fort as to form an inclined plain, falling off at both 
ends, and to drain it completely by its own furrows, which 
were to run into the ditches on each fide of the field. When 
this underfoil had got its proper Ihape, he marked off an- 
other 10 feet trench, and, with the fpade alone, threw the 
upper foil of the fecond trench upon the new formed under 
foil of the firft, fo as to cover it completely with the fame 
cultivated earth uppermoft, which had been the upper fur- 
face before ; and fo on through the Whole field, until he 
came to the laft trench, upon which, when the proper ftiape 
was given with the under foil, the upper foil, which had 
been laid up upon the edge of the firft trench, was carted 
round and laid on, which completed the operation. The 
appearance of the field then was uniform and regular, rifing 
in the middle, and falling off at both ends towards the 
ditches which receives the furface water. It was then di- 
vided into 18 feet ridges, and continues fo ; and by this 
means the whole field was levelled, without burying any 
part of the original furface^ The expence of this, upon a 

ten 



of Long/organ, 505 

ten acre field, which was the laft done, was nearly about 
L. 6 per acre for labourers alone, exclufive of carts, hories, 
and farm-fervants. But the whole might very probably 
have been done at about L. 8 per acre, including every ex- 
pence* The fame year, that field was well dunged and 
limed, and fown with wheat, and yielded very near 14 
bolls per Scotch acre, near 7-i quarters Whinchefter meafure. 
Wages are higher now; but ftill he thinks it would be 
well worth while to drefs many fields in the Carle in the 
fame manner. It is alfo worthy of remark, that the field 
above mentioned had originally been a meadow, with a 
great part of it mofs, and before it was levelled and drefled, 
the middle of it was fo low and wet, it fcarce ever bore a 
crop worth reaping. 

Surface-draining on Clay. — As clay is perfectly imper- 
vious to water, furface-draining is the only means by which 
this fpecies of improvement can be accompliilied ; and all 
over the Carfe of Gowrie, this operation is extremely 
fimple. There are certain large common drains, which, 
pafs through the diftrift in different direftions, fufficiently 
capacious to receive the water drained from the fields by 
the ditches which furround them, and of fuch a level as to 
carry it clear off, and to empty their contents into the river 
Tay. There are alfo ditches which furround every farm, 
or pafs through them, as their fixations may require, but 
in fuch manner as to communicate with every field upon 
the farm. Thefe ditches are made from 2 to 4 feet wide 
at top, and from 1*. to 1 foot at bottom ; a fliape which 
prevents their fides from falling in ; but even then they 
muft be cleanfed and fcoured every year at a confutable 
expence. If the fields be of an uniform level furface, the 
common furrows between the ridges, provided they be 
fufficiently deepened at their .extremities, will ferve to lav

the grounds dry ; but as it feldom happens that any field uft 
the Carfe is fo completely free of inequalities, the laft ope- 
ration, after it is fown and harrowed in, is to draw a furrow 
with the plough through every hollow in the field, which 
lies in fuch a direction that it can be guided through them, 
as at a a a, and fo as to make a free communication with 
any of the furrounding ditches, or with any of the furrows 

between the ridges, as at 
b b b b, which may ferve as 
a conductor to carry the 
water off to the ditches up- 
on the extremities ccce. 
When this track, is once 
opened with the plough, it 
is widened, cleared out, and 
fo fhaped with the fpade r 
that it may run no riik 
of filling up. Its width

breadth of a fpade at 
bottom is a good gene- 
ral rule. It frequently 
happens, that there are 
inequalities in feveral 
parts of the fame field, 
which do not extend 
wholly acrofs it, or 
which do not pafs 
through it, in any direction that a plough can follow; but 
which may extend over two ridges, d d, or one ridge, e, or 
even part of a ridge ; fuch require an open communication-

to be made with any conducting furrow, to carry off the 
water, which are always made with the fpade. All thefe 
open communications are here called gaas ; and to keep 
them perfectly clear is a very eflential part of every Carfe 
farmer's attention. It is as yet a general practice in the 
Carfe to have head-ridges, as they are called, at the two ex- 
tremities of each field ; i. e. the ground upon which the 
plough turns is laid up in the fhape of a tranfverfe ridge, 
higher in the middle, and falling off at each fide •, fo that a 
gaa is made in the courfe of the inner furrow, as at f f f f, 
with which the whole furrows between the longitudi- 
nal ridges communicate, and into which they pour all 
their furface water, which is carried off by fimilar gaas, or 
openings, cut through the head-ridges, at convenient diftan- 
ces, as at g g g g, and by which the whole is emptied into 
the adjoining ditches, c c c c, and by them into the main 
drain. 

It is fuppofed that it would be a much better plan, in- 
fiead of forming head ridges, as above defcribed, to lay the 
earth up to the ends of the longitudinal ridges uniformly, 
which could eafily be done with a little more trouble, by 
returning with an empty plough. There would then be no 
depreffion between the longitudinal and tranfverfe ridges, 
of courfe, no occafion for a gaa; and by cutting fairly 
through the head ridges oppofite to every longitudinal fur- 
vow, a freer paflage would be given to the furface-water 
from the whole field to the adjoining ditch, and, of courfe, 
the draining be more complete. This method Mr Paterfon 
ha3 followed upon all the fields which he has levelled, and 
which is reprefented by the Fig. a. 

Befides all thefe, an experienced Carfe farmer will take 
care that his ground is carefully ploughed ; that the land is 
laid up equally ; that no inequalities are left, fo as to hold 
water; that the ridges are properly rounded, neither too 

high

Statijlical Account 



high nor too low, but as near as poffible to the fe&amp;ion of a 
large circle : By which the furface-water will eafily drain 
off, without lodging; and while the crowns are not too 
much enriched, nor the furrows impoverifhed, the whole 
will be made equally fertile, dry, and prolific, and not un- 
frequently be acceffible to the plough earlier in the fpring 
than the fields upon the declivities of the furrounding hills . 
and the reafon is obvious, becaufe there is no fpouts, no un- 
der-ground water to get rid of ; nothing but Superficial 
moilture alone. 

Braining in Locwi and inclining Fields. — The fouthern 
declivities of the hills in this parilh, in general, confifl: of rich 
loam, which is exceedingly prolific. But as the furface is 
irregular, and as the fubftrata confift of rocky protuberances, 
veins of fand, and, in fome places, impervious till or fchif- 
tus-, while, in a natural ftate, they are fpouty, and until they 
are droned, in many places they are totally incapable of 
any agricultural improvement. The manner of draining 
thefe is various, according to the ftiape and lie of the field, 
and alfo of the different places where the water Ihows itfelf. 
If from one fpring only, and if that can be cut off from the 
grounds above, the talk is eafy ; but if the fpouts or fprings 
are many, or if the appearance happens in feyeral places, 
and no original fpring be difcovered, the drains muft be 
carried through the field, in fuch a manner as to communi- 
cate with every place where the water appears, and this is 
in general done according to the (kill, experience, or fome.. 
times the caprice of the farmer ; fometimes zig-zag r

fometimes in this fafhion^ 

and fome- 
times, e- 
fpecially if 

the field will admit of it, a main drain is carried diagonally 
from corner to corner of the field, with other drains, leading 
either through, or from every fpouty part of the field, thus* 

which is called feathering ; but if 
there happens to be rocky protu- 
berances, the drains muft be care- 
fully guided round them. Thefe 
drains are formed thus : A ditch 
is dug, in any direction the far- 
mer may think proper, at leaft 
three feet deep and two feet broad, 
(narrower may do if the ftones be 
fcarce), and the whole mould be left open till it mould be 
feen whether thofe made are fufficient to drain off the water 
from all the fpouty parts of the field. 

The next thing to be attended to, is to take care that 
the bottom of the ditch be lower than any vein of fand 
which touches it, or which communicates with it* Other- 
wife the drain will be of no ufe ; as the fandy veins will 
conduft the water wherever they reach, which will burfl; 
out at the firft. obftruction. Satisfied in thefe particulars, 
the ditches may be filled, from one foot to 18 inches as the 
quantity of water may require, with fmall ftones, broken 
on purpofe, and laid in as irregularly as poffible. Over 

thefe 




5 i ® Statiftical Account 

thefe, a Soat of fix inches of ftraw, furze, or broom is laid, 
to keep the earth which is now filled in over it, from trind- 
ling through, and which in time forms a matted coat, and 
leaves about a foot or 14 inches of furface above. The 
furze or broom is better than the ftraw, but good gravel, 
free of earth, if it can be had, is better than either. If that 
lhould not be judged of fufficient depth for the plough, the 
ditch may be made deeper at fxrfl. Thefe under-ground 
drains are called here livers, and, if carefully conftru&amp;ed at 
firft, may remain in good order, and anfwer every purpofe 
expected from them for many years, while the whole field 
appears one uniform furface. Mr Paterfon drained a field, 
£0 full of rocky protuberances that he was obliged to feel 
his way with an iron rod, to know where there was fpace 
enough between the rocks to guide the drain to be made. 

Injlruments of Husbandry. — The inftruments of hulban- 
dry commonly ufed in this parifh, differ very little from 
what is ufed in the neighbourhood. 

There are 12a ploughs, all of which, at leaft fuch as good 
farmers ufe, are of Small's conftru&amp;ion, with iron mould- 
boards, or generally fo. Some fmaller farmers indeed ufe one, 
which partakes of the old Scots plough, and which they call 
a mongrel-, but it is a very inferior inftmment. About 
twenty years ago, and even lefs, four horfes, two and two 
abreaft, were frequently feen in the plough, with one man 
holding and another driving; fometimes with three horfes 
and two men: But now, ploughing is entirely performed 
witli two horfes abreaft, with one man who holds a-.d 
drives, except upon very particular occafions, when hard 
ground muft be raifed by main force ; and which requires 
, the exertion of four horfes. 

There

There are other ploughs ufed for drilled crops, fuch as 
potatoes, turnips, and beans. One called, a fcraper, with a 
broad flat fock, made to cut a fpace of about 6 inches, and 
from each wing of the plough a thin plate of iron runs 
down to the level of the fock, with a cutting edge in the 
direction of the drill, and its point turned inwards, and fo 
contrived, that thefe three, i. e. the fock and two wing*, 
lhallcut or brum along the whole ipace between the drills, 
and cut up every weed at about 2 or 3 inches deep. This 
operation is fucceeded by another, with a double-headed 
plough, the heads of which are fmaller than the common 
plough, and fo contrived, with the flat fide of each head 
outwards, as to cut clofe to the edge of each drill ; and as 
the mould-boarls of each are of courfe upon its infide, it 
turns the mould inwards, leaving a ridge of earth and col- 
lected weeds in the middle of the fpace between the drills. 
The whole drilling operation is finifhed with the double 
mould-board plough : AH thefe are tempered with a rack 
and pin. 

There is alfo a very ingenious inftrument ufed in this 
parifh for fowing turnip. It is conftru&amp;ed thus: Two 
wooden rollers, of about 8 inches diameter, placed on end 
upon one axle, for convenience of turning, both together 
occupying a fpace of 6 feet, fo as to ftretch over two drills 
at a time, are fixed by a frame to lhafts for one horfe ; and 
behind this another frame of light wood is attached to it by 
a rope or chain from its middle, in which laft frame is pla- 
ced an iron axle, with a light iron wheel of \% inches dia- 
meter at each end, and to which axle are fitted two boxes 
with covers for fowing turnip, with conductors, to which 
are fitted iron points, moveable, fo as to open the earth and 
drop the feed deeper or fhallower at pleafure. The boxes, 
alfo are moveable upon the axle, to be fitted to any di- 
ftance of drills ; and behind each conductor a fmall roller of 
24 inches wide, and 4 inches diameter, moves in flieers to

roll in the feed. With this inftrument one man may, with 
great eafe, fow ten acres in a day. 

Harrows, l$c.— -The harrows ufed here are of the com- 
mon kind, with very little difference, only fome lighter 
and fome heavier, but all of them have a crofs fpar fixed 
upon otie fide, about 3 feet long, and about 6 or 8 inches 
high, which they call a rider, and which prevents the har- 
rows from overtoping one another, efpecially in turning. Mr 
Paterfon, fome years ago, when the wheat feed time was very 
rainy, got a beam 18 feet long, made to the breadth of the 
ridges ; upon each extremity of which he fixed an old fore- 
wheel of a coach, and hung a fet of harrows to the beam, 
fo as to take in the whole ridge at once ; and to each end of 
the beam attached 3 or 4 horfes, to go in the furrows in a 
line, by which the ground was completely harrowed, and 
none of the feed trampled down with the horfes feet* This 
he has ufed ever fince, when a wet feafon makes it neceflary, 
and with great advantage, and feveral farmers have follow- 
ed the example. He alfo ufes another harrow for his drill- 
crops alone, and only when the ground is exceedingly foul 
with couch grafs. It is about 2 feet wide, and 5 feet long, 
with teeth fet in diagonal lines, but fo as to leave no part 
of the furface over which it goes untouched. On its fore- 
part is a ftaple of iron, to which a fwingle-tree and traces 
are fixed for the horfe ; and to its hinder part a handle of 
wood, about 4 or 5 feet long, rifes up, and inclining a little 
backwards ; from the middle of which a light fpur of iron 
runs forwards, and is inferted into the harrow about its 
middle. The whole fo contrived, that the man who drives 
can eafily guide it, prefs it down into the earth, or raife it 
up, and leave the accumulated couch or weeds behind, at 
pleafure.

Carts. — The carts formerly ufed in this parifb, and which 
are ft 5 11 generally in ufe, meafure, in length, over the top of 
the coop, (box), 6 feet ; in breadth, 3 feet 8 inches ; in 
depth, 1 foot 3 inches ; and narrowing a little towards the 
bottom, fo as to contain about 26 cubic feet. But the coops 
now introduced meafure, in length, 5 feet 3 inches, and 
narrowing at the bottom to 4 feet 8 inches ; and in breadfh, 
over the top, 4 feet 8 inches, narrowing to 3 feet 7 inches 
at bottom, and 1 foot 3 inches in depth. They contain 
nearly the fame cubic meafure of 26 feet ; but from their 
fhape, and being placed more forward upon the axle, they 
are much lighter upon the horfe, and an eafier draught. 
They anfwer very well with one horfe for moft pnrpofes; 
but with two they fatigue the horfes much lefs, even with 
a much greater load. 

Tbrajhing-mill.—ln the year 1788, Mr Paterfon fet up 
the firft thrafhing-mill in this part of the country ; and now, 
(1796), there are builc, and building, fifteen in this parifh. 
alone. This powerful machine is, perhaps, one of the great- 
eft improvements in farming which the age has produced ; 
but it is now fo well known, a defcription is fcarce necef- 
fary, and not eafy to be underftood without a drawing*. 
Vol. XIX. -3 T Machine 

* The thralhing-mill at Caftle-Huntly was built at firft by one James Mor- 
ris, an inhabitant of Longforgan, taken from one which had been fet up for 
fome time before, at Mr Mains of Pous in Stirlingfhire, and btult by William 
Jaffray, a mill-wright in Alloa, who finifhed the machine at Caftle-Himtlv 
himfelf. If confifted then limply of a horizontal wheel over the horfes 
heads, placed in a made, and adjoining to the barn, with two levers of about 
14 feet long, with a horfe to each, which turned a lying fhaft by a pinion, 
upon the other end of which was placed a vertical wheel, which turned a 
cylinder, or drum, of about 4 feet diameter, and 5 feet long ; upon which 
was fixed fix thrafhers, and to which the corn was conducted, after being laid 
upon a breaft of wood, by two fluted rollers, which were made to prefs

lying fhaft. 

Upon the fuppofition that the mill thus conftrucled had not fufficient velo- 
city to threih the corn perfectly clean, it was altered fome time after by Mt 
Miekle, alfo of Alloa, who added fanners, or a winnowing machine, to fepa- 
tate the corn from the chaff; and multiplying wheels, which increafed the 
velocity fo much, that with four threfhers only upon the drum, if the hori- 
zontal or liorfe-wbeel went twice round in a minute, which horfes can eafily 
do * at their ufual pace, the drum will move through a fpace of 1496 feet, 
and the corn patting through the mill will receive 832 ftrokes in the fame 
time : But this machine requires 7 or 8 men, and 4 horfes at leaft ; even 
6 or 8 horfes maybe put to, which makes the work much eafier. This mill 
has threfhed and winnowed o-§ bolls of wheat Linlithgow meafure, = to 
j quarters 4 pecks Winchefter meafure, in 27 minutes: but this was in 1793 
for feed, when the crop was rich, and the ftraw fhort ; for it is to be obferved, 
that the power and execution of thrafliing-mills are various according to cir- 
cumftances, independent of the machine itfelf ; fuch as, the richnefs of the 
crop, and the length of the ftraw : If the crop be rich, and the ftraw fhort, 
the mill will thrafh more in a given time ; and, vice vcrfa. Mr Mickle alfo 
reverfed the motion of the drum, and made it give the ftroke upwards inftead 
of downwards, as formerly, which was found to be a very great improvement, 
and has been univerfally adopted ever fince. 

Since that time, the threfhing mill has been ftill farther improved, by add- 
ing to it a rake with four wings, which is turned by a ftrap from the lying 
axle, and moves over a concave grating, through which the corn falls into 
the hopper of the fanners, while the fhaker (as it is called) turns out the 
ftraw upon a Hoping rack, perfectly clean, and by that means faves the labour 
of two men at leaft. And what is very remarkable, the moft approved milts 
now, after many experiments have been made, are built exadlly upon the 
fame principles with that built by William Jaffray in 17 88, with the hori- 
zontal or horfe wheel 16 feet in diameter, and the fpear-wheel 4$ feet, and 
the drum from 3 to 4 feet, which is calculated to Imake nearly about 90 re- 
volutions for once of the horfe wheel. This goes with great eafe with four 
horfes; threfhes the corn perfectly clean as far as nearly 10 bolls in the hour. 
One of the belt in the Carfe is lately built by William Dick, wright in Dun- 
dee, at BaUendean, and farther imprpvemeuts are ftill going on. Very good

every other fpecies of beftial upon the farm, it may be proper 
to mention, that, for horfes, it is necefiary to clean them per- 
fectly from all earthy particles which may adhere to them. 
For this purpofe every farmer fliould have a machine for 
warning them, to fhorten labour. A fquare trough of Wood,

according to the quan- 
tity, provided with birch brooms, rinfes and cleans the yams,

and by drawing the plug, e , the whole earth and water 
may be let out at once, while the yams remain in the up- 
per apartment quite clean and free of earth ; but if not 
io well cleaned, or if the earth be hardened about them, 
by putting in the plug at bottom, the trough may be «. 
ed again with wfer, either that the yams may be rinfed 
agam, or remain covered with the water as long as may 
be fufficient to foften the adhering earth, which will then 
feparate with the birch broom from the yams with great 
eafe. 

Stacking Grain.— When the corn is cut down, the next 
important operation in huibandfy is to get it in fafe, and to 
preferve it found, and alto to proteft it from plunder by 
animals of every defeription, whether wild or domeftic. 
The general method of building ftacks in this parifh is up- 
on the ground, and, if the corn be win in the field, no 
precaution whatever is thought neceffary ; fo that, although 
it be preferved found, it becomes a prey to rats and mice, 
and to every animal which can get in to the corn-yard.' 
A better method is to build the Hacks upon what is called 
Statholls, which are conftrufited as under ; A number of 
pillars of {tone or wood, eight or ten or more, may be pla- 
ced in a circular form, according to the diameter of the in- 
tended flack, and one in the middle of the circle ; all thefe 
are covered with caps of round ltones, projecting, fo far that 
no rat or any fuch animal can get up from the ground ; and 
the pillars are made about 2 feet high at leaft, to prevent 
geefe or turkeys from drawing the corn at bottom. Upon 
thefe ftones, a frame of wood is laid, and from the middle 
of this frame a cone of wooden fpars is raifed, of about 4 or 

5 feet diameter at bottom, and ending in a point at about 

6 or 8 feet high, according to the height of the ftack, of 
; which the cones muft not be higher than the intake at far- 
theft 



of Long/organ.

theft. From this cone, wooden pipes are laid acrofs the 
ftack when building, and are cut to its fhape. Thefe are 
made of three rough fir boards, very partially fitted to each 
other, fo as to let the air pafs in all directions amongft the 
•{heaves of corn. But the principal ufe is to draw the air 
up through the cone in the centre, and guide it through 
every part of the ftack. By which means, corn may fafe- 
ly be taken much fooner in, ; than when no fuch precau- 
tion is ufed *. 

Formerly the fmall farmers and acremen had no tacks, 
(leafes), but were tenants at will, and were alfo bound down 
to all the fevere conditions, as already mentioned ; and fo 
little was the interefl of the landlord underftood, or the te- 
nant regarded, that fo lately, as between the year 1750 and 
1760, it was an eftablifhed cufrom, that the Earl of Strath- 
more's officers, (who was the proprietor at that time), ac- 
tually 

* There is ftill another method, lately introduced by a very refpectable, 
gentleman f, not far from hence, but not in this pariili, which is probably the 
beft means of preferring and taking in corn ever thought of; which is, by- 
building frames of wood to any extent, upon which the corn is laid, 
the breadth of two flieaves only, and a binding one in the middle, as upon a 
flielf, with the heads inwards and for a depth of about 3 feet: Another flielf 
of wooden fpars is laid and fixed into the perpendicular iloops (uprights) irv 
fuch falhion as to prevent any prerRire from the fuperincumbent flieaves. 
Upon this lhclf or frame the com is again placed, iu the fame manner, and 
over that another, and fo on, as high as you pleaie ; fo that the flieaves be 
looleiy laid, and receive from all quarters fuch a body of air as to dry and 
wm the corn completely, even if taken in immediately from the hook, (fickle), 
provided it be cut down dry. Whether this be a new thought or not is of no- 
cemfequence. The gentleman who has introduced it has great merit- and 
although die e:pence of budding the apparatus may prevent the method from 
becommg general loon, Specially as in thofe fixations where the climate is 
favourable, or the feafoti dry, it is by no. means fo neceflary, yet there arc 
many p aces m this country, where lome fuch plan of preferring the -corns 
vvou d be always uieful; and there are Jbmetimcs feafons fo unfavourable, as 
would make fuch a refource a very fortunate circumftance for all concerned-,

tually feized upon one tenth of the crop yearly, upon the 
lands of Longforgan, as part rent, and carried it, corn and 
fodder, off the field ; and not one dared to lead a fiieaf of 
corn till that was done. Some time after, new tacks (leafes) 
were entered into, more favourable to the tenant; but, in all, 
ftill fuch a number of feudal fervices were required, as to 
ihow the practice of former times, and how unwilling they 
were to give them up ; and, what is very extraordinary, it 
was not the landlords alone who were unwilling to give 
them up : for ift the year 178a, when the prefent proprie- 
tor of Caftle-Huntly propofed to convert all the feudal 
bondages into a very moderate money-rent, fome very in- 
telligent tenants were averfe to convert even the harveft- 
bondage, which of all others was the molt oppreflive, al- 
though at the moderate computation of lod. per day per 
ihearer. 

State in 1 777. — In all the leafes delivered to the prefent 
proprietor of Longforgan in 1777, there was very little dif- 
ference from former cuftoms ; only, formerly, they were 
bound to all fervices, and at all times. In thefe tacks, the 
number and kind of fervices were exprefled. They were 
all thirled to a particular mill, i. e. they were bound to 
grind all their corns at the baron's mill : For the mill of 
Millhill, to which Longforgan and all the eftate of Caftle- 
Huntly were then thirled, although feparated from that ba- 
rony, originally belonged to it; and although the eftate of 
Millhill had been fold out of the family, by one of the 
Earls of Strathmore, yet fo little was the intereft either of 
proprietor or tenant attended to or underftood, that he fuf- 
fered his tenants upon the eftate of Caftle-Huntly, (then 
Lyon), to remain bound to grind their corns at the mill, no 
fonger his own.

Hand Mills. — Formerly hand mills or querns (as they are 
called), were the only inftruments ufed in this country for 
grinding corn ; but it is probable, that when thofe were 
found unequal to the demand, mills were built by the 
landlord who had water at his command, as a benefit to his 
tenants and retainers ; and that the miller became bound 
not only to grind all the corns ufed by the tenants upon the 
eftate, but alfo to fend for them and return them in meal ; 
for which certain multures in kind, that is certain quantities 
of the corns (millers tolls) were allowed, which was called 
thirlage. The tenants were alfo obliged to give their help 
in preparing the corn for grinding, and cleaning the mill- 
lead, 1. e. the tra&amp; which conduces the water for the mill 
wheel, ifc. 

In thofe days, when mills were but few in number, the 
privilege of getting their corns ground might be a great 
convenience at any price 5 but afterwards, when their num- 
bers encreafed, and the millers became rivals for employ- 
ment, what was originally meant as an ufeful convenience 
became a very great hardfhip. The baron, to keep up the 
rent of his mill, obliged his tenants to grind all their corns 
there as formerly, although they could have got their crops 
manufactured cheaper at other mills, where, naturally, the 
rates were lowered to thofe -who were not obliged to fre- 
quent rhem, in order to invite cuftomers ; while the millers 
became inattentive, negligent, and fometimes infolent and 
overbearing, to thofe who were bound to their mill. Hence 
the grievance of thirlage, which is fo much complained of. 

Tach or Leafes formerly — The tacks (leafes) entered 
into, between 1760 and 1770, with the greater tenants in 
this pan/h, were in general for 38 years, to themfelves, 
heirs, executors and affignees, with power to fubfet. They 
Were all thirled to a particular mill ; their reftriftions were

Joofe and unguarded j fubjeft. to bondage in harveft and a 
certain number of carriages ; and, as the clay of this parifh 
was then in exceeding bad order, lime was given by the 
proprietor to moft of them, and a fmall rent in mo- 
ney required for fome years ; after which their rent was 
partly in wheat, barley and meal, deliverable between 
ChrilUmas and Candlemas; partly -in money, either pay- 
able at Whitfunday, or one-half then and one-half at Lam- 
Ynas or at Martinmas. Liferent tacks were then not un- 
common ; and they fometimes extended to two or three 
lives. In fome tacks (leafes) a very extraordinary claufe 
was introduced ; the tenant had leave to name any life he 
pleafed during his tack (leafe), upon" which his poffeflion 
was to continue. 

Tacks or Leafes now. — At this day, there is no thirlage ; 
there is no bondage in harveft ; nor are the tenants bound to 
days work in planting, &amp;.c. They pay their rents in mo- 
ney and victual only. They are not bound to go meflages ; 
and they only are bound to carry with their horfes and 
carts, a certain proportion of coals for the proprietors family, 
if they refide ; which is exceedingly moderate, and fome 
carts for lime, &amp;c. which is feldom demanded ; but it is ex'- 
"prefsly provided, that they mall not be demanded either in 
feed- time, or harveft. 

■ Divijions into Sixes. — In 1775, or thereabouts, the prac- 
tice of dividing the carfe farms into fixes, became pretty ge- 
neral ; and it became -a claufe in moft tacks (leales), to have 
i-6;h of the farm m fallow, i-6th in wheat, i-6th in beans 
or peafe, i-6th in barley, i-6th in clover, and i-6th in oats; 
which practice is faid to have been introduced by the late 
Henry Crawford of Monorgan, Efq-, and it has been conti- 
nued in the clay by the belt farmers ever fiuce. • Sometime

autumn, after oats or wheat, and again in the fpring ; they 
may then be planted in drills, either with dung or Without 
it, according to the Mate of the field, or the crop which is to 
follow. If they be planted after dunged wheat, and to be 
followed with barley, dung is unnecefTary. If after oats, as 
a cleaning crop, and to be followed by wheat, it is a good 
practice to dung them well. This enfures a great crop of 
yams ; prevents carting upon and poaching the ground as 
much as poffible ; and if the field be in proper order, may 
be followed by wheat, without any more dung. However, 
this is not recommended as the bell preparation for wheat* 

jt)riils.— In planting yams, the drills may be drawn from 
Hi to i\ feet diftant, according to the judgment of the far- 
mer. If the ground be very rich, and if the principal ob- 
ject be to clean it properly for a crop of wheat to follow, 
and, if well dunged, a very great crop may be expected at 
44- feet diftant, and there will be ample room to work it as 
perfectly as if it was fallow. The ftems will cover the 
whole completely, and with eafe. Every extraneous plant 
may be deftroyed. The fets mould be large, about i-4th of a 
large yam, dropped at about one foot or nine inches afunder. 
Small fets do not anfwer fo well. 

A great Crop. — In 1794, upon the Mains of Caftle-Hunt- 
ly, a field of yams was dreffed in this manner, and yielded 
110 bolls per Scotch acre, which weighed, when cleaned of 
earth, 5 ftone 5 pounds Dutch per firiot, or 2,3 ftone Eng- 
lifti per boll, at 16 pounds each ftone, or 40,480 pounds per 
acre. It was well dunged to the yams ; and the wheat 
crop that followed looked remarkably well, Auguft 1795, 
but did not turn out fo well as was expected. This, how- 
ever, is no rule, as the wheat crop in general, and particu- 
larly through the Carfe, was light that year. A Scotch

acre is to an Engliih acre nearly as 1 25 to 100. If the foil 
be ofan inferior quality, the drills mould be nearer, that 
the ftems may cover the ground completely. 

Management. —Before the plants appear above ground, 
they mould be well harrowed, which deftroys all annuals 
that may have appeared, and opens the foil. As foon as 
they are well above ground, the ufual praftice is to take 
away the earth from the drills on each fide with a common 
plough. The earlier this is done the better, as it not only 
deftroys the frefli crop of weeds, but it foftens the earth, 
and approximates to the warmth of the fun the young 
fibres, beginning to moot ; and if this operation be too long 
delayed, thefe tender fibres, which, in procefs of time, are 
to be loaded with an abundant crop, run a rifle of being cut 
off by the plough, and their progeny totally deftroyed. This 
operation may be performed in half the time with the fcra- 
per and double-headed plough, already defcribed for drilled 
crops ; i, e. the fcraper goes firft, and cuts up all the weeds, 
and is immediately followed by the double-headed plough, 
which takes away earth and weeds from the drills, and 
ridges them in the middle fpace between. Each of thefe 
initruments, by a particular conftrudrion, can be made wider 
or narrower, fo as to fit itfelf to any diftance of drills, and 
are eafily drawn by one horfe. They can be ufed to ad- 
vantage in light foils only ; for if the foil be ftrong, it is not 
poflible to get them deep enough in the ground, fo as to 
root out every weed ; nor can they be made to loofen the 
earth fufficiently for the young fibres to ftioot; and if fo, a 
prolific crop is not to be expected. In fuch foils, a com- 
mon plough, upon the principle of Small's, but made light 
on purpofe, is certainly beft. The next operation is hand- 
hoeing, which can now eafily be done, and which anfwers a 
triple purpofe, as it deftroys all the luxuriant weeds which 

the

531 



the plough could not reach, loofens the earth about the 
roots of the ftem, and covers with a frefh mould thofe fibres, 
now making quick progrefs from the parent root. 

After this, efpecially if the field be foul, the fpaces be- 
tween the drills fliould be well harrowed with a fmall har- 
row, of a particular conftruction, already defcribed for drill 
crops. One horfe draws it along, and the man who drives 
the horfe can eafily guide it by the handle, and prefs the 
whole harrow fufficiently into the earth, fo as to pick up 
every particle of couch-grafs, or any other fibrous weed ; 
and when the harrow is fo loaded as not to be able to carry 
any more along, the driver, with great eafe, lifts it up, 
leaves the colle&amp;ed weeds or couch-grafs behind, to be car- 
ried out of the field afterwards, and panes on with his har- 
row. After this operation, the ground is left, until the an- 
nual weeds have lhewn themfelves in full vegetation ; but 
before the fteras of the yams are too luxuriant, and then 
with the common plough, if the drills be wide, the earth is 
laid up with one or two furrows, according to the diftance 
between each, or as the farmer's judgment mall direct; and 
afterwards, the whole is finiftied with a double mould-board 
plough palling between each drill : But if the drills be nar- 
row, it generally lays up the whole earth at once, without 
any afliftance from the common plough. 

When the yams are fully ripe, which will probably hap- 
pen fometime in Odtober, and which is known by the de- 
cay of the Items and the ripening apples, they are to be ta- 
ken up either with the fpade or with the plough, and gathered; 
but it is a good praftice to cut the ftems firft with a fcvthe, and 
carry them off the field, which makes an excellent bedding 
in the dung court for a fucceeding year ; and if the farmer 
keeps pigs nothing will be loll, as they will pick up all the 
apples, and every yam which may adhere to the ftems. It 
has alfo been remarked by experienced farmers, that if the 

potatoes 



53* 



Statijlkal Account 



potatoes or yams are fuflered to remain in the ground until 
their feeds are fully ripe, they exhauft it exceedingly ; and 
hence, even on this account, a crop of potatoes, thus mana- 
ged, is a very bad preparation for wheat. They mould be 
taken up earlier, or they mould be followed by fome other 
fpecies of grain. Yams and potatoes are by no means 
meliorating crops *. 

Potatoes. 

* If poffible, yams mould be taken up in dry weather, free of earth, and be- 
fore froft. The floor of the houfe, in which they are meant to be ftewed, 
fhould be laid with ftraw, and all the fides nest to the walls, and the whole 
well covered ; and' if carefully managed in this manner, they will keep welL 
till midfummer or longer, and ftill be firm and juicy ; this is much better 
than any method whatever of preferring them out of doors. 

Horfes are very fond of them ; but one half peck is quite enough to give 
at a time in the beginning, and never more than one peck fhould be givei: 
in the day ; with thefe and ftraw alone, horfes maybe very well kept 
through the winter, if not very hard worked ; and if it fhould be judged 
neceffary to giye them any corn, it mould he bruifed, or given in meal, and 
very little at a time ; for as the yams generally keep the belly open, if corn 
be given at the fame time, it will be found to pafs perfectly whole and un- 
digefted. Cattle may be indulged with more, if agreeable to them.'as the ob- 
ject with them is different ; but with them, alfo, they fhould be given in 
fmall quantities at firft, and then to be regulated by the effect, as they are 
very apt to fcour and not to feed, if given in fo large quantities, efpecially 
at firft. 

The yam does not boil as the common potatoes/ but they foften a little ; 
and when boiled with chaff or bran, they make a moll excellent feed for 
milch-cows in the winter, and if attended to, they will give butter equal, 
or not much inferior, to what they give when fed on clover. They may be 
alfo given raw to cows with advantage, which fome experienced farmers 
prefer to boiling. 

If horfes are to be fed with yams, ift, It is of the utmoft confequeuce 
to clean them moft perfectly, as any fand or earthy matter adhering to 
them may be of the moft dangerous confequences, from the particular 
itrudture of the horfe's bowels. 2d, In winter particularly, (but it is at 
all times a good pra&amp;ice), the yams fnould be waflied this day, which 
are to be ufed the day following. Immediately after wafhing, they flioulij 
eith«r be carried into the liable in wheel-barrows, or troughs, with holes in 
the bottom, to draw off the moifture ; or thrown into an empty Hall for

Potatoes.— Potatoes may in every refpea be treated 
nearly in the fame manner with advantage. The ground 
prepared in the fame way ; the crop will certainly be im- 
proved in quantity by dunging well in the dnlls, perhaps 
not in quality. As the Items of the potatoes are not fo lux- 
uriant, for the purpofe of improving a fucceeding crop, the 
drills may be nearer, perhaps about a* f eet, for it is of the 
utmoft confequence to the ground, to prepare it for a 
fucceeding crop, that the whole mould be completely co- 
vered with the items of the potatoes, or with the green crop 
of whatever kind. The potatoes ripen fooner than the 
yams, and the manner of preferving them is the fame ; but 
they do not keep juicy fo long ; and while the one is moft 
excellent food for man, the other is equally, perhaps more, 
beneficial for cattle. 

Potatoes have been long an object of particular attention 
to the villagers of Longforgan, as well of thofe who have 
fmall farms as of thofe who have none ; and the practice is 
promoted by the matter farmers who occupy the rich 
brae land in the neighbourhood, letting out fmall portions 
of it which they mean to be wheat, at perhaps the , rate of 
four guineas or more per acre. The farmer ploughs and 
prepares the land, and each man plants or dibbles his mea- 
fured portion with potatoes. Sometime after this, and be- 
fore the plant appears above ground, they loofen all the 

ground 

that purpofe ; by which means the cold chillinefs from warning will he ta- 
ken off, which is much more dangerous to horfes, and is much oftener the 
caufe of difeafes in the bowels than is generally thought. But if, notwith- 
ftanding all this care, fymptoms of cholic appear, let a drink be prepared 
confifting of an Englifli quart of fmall beer warmed, with a table fpoonful 
of ground pepper, and near an Englifli pint of malt fpirit (whiflty), and 
given immediately, which feldom fails to cure. If the complaint does not 
yield to this, and if it be entirely from food, from one-half to an ounce of 
laudanum fhould be given in a warm drink ; and at any rate, if the horfe con- 
fiuues in pain, it is always fafe to let blood.

ground completely with a hack, an inftrument with a ban. 
die of about 4 or 5 feet long, and two iron prongs like a 
iork : but turned inwards. This makes the plants rife 
itronger and gives the roots room to fpread, fo as to yield 
perhaps a hundred bolls per acre j and during the whole 
progrefc of the plants coming forward, they make it their 
bufinefc to clean the ground perfedly by hand-hoeing, which 
prepares it for the fucceeding crop. 

When houfes cannot be had, both yams and potatoes 
may be kept in temporary fhades made on purpofe, Hoping 
liketheroofofahoufe, which maybe built at fmall ex- 
pence, of young firs and thatched, the bottom and fides well 
lined with ftraw, and a deep trench drawn round them to 
keep them dry, with a door or opening at one end, from 
which they may be taken at pleafure ; but always kept 
well covered to prevent accefs to froft. * 

The 

* The curl is a difeafe to which potatoes are exceedingly fubject, and 
which, it is believed, is as yet but little underftood. A notion feems to pre- 
vail that it is infectious, and that it will propagate both by roots and Items. 
This year (1795) there feemed to have been, in many places, more of this 
difeafe all over the country than had appeared for many years ; and it is ob- 
fervable, that Jfrom the fame feed, planted in different fields, the one has 
abounded with cujl, while the other was perfectly free: Alfo, in the fame 
field, fome fpots have been difeafed, and others not ; but the found potatoes 
always were upon the drieft part of the field. From the idea of its being 
infectious, directions have been given, that as foon as the curl appeared, the 
difeafed root fhould be immediately dug up and thrown away. But, to 
prove this, as foon as the curl ^appeared in a field belonging to the author 
of this paper, he placed marks in the ground between the difeafed and the 
found : and there did not appear, through the whole feafon, the leaft fymp- 
tom of the difeafe increafing ; that is, thofe which were not difeafed when 
the marks were put in, remained fo to the end of the feafon perfectly found. 
And while the curl was prevalent in the fields, not one potatoe, planted in 
the garden, had the leaft appearance of difeafe. Mentioning thefe circum- 
itances to a very ingenious gentlemen, he gave it as his opinion, that this 
4ifeafe doe? not proceed from the feed, and that it is not infectious ; but 
that it is owing principally to wet foil, rainy feafon?, or an error in cultiva- 
tion ;

Lint.—* The inhabitants of Longforgan have been remark- 
ably fuccefsful for many years in railing great crops of lint. 
Their practice in this particular, is well worth imitation. 
They water their lint grounds with their dung- water and 
eow wafh ; but it muft be done in rainy weather, to prevent 
this eflence of dung from burning up the crop. This mode 
may be ufed to great advantage upon grafs-grounds and has 
been tried this year by a farmer in this parifh, upon four 
acres of wheat, and upon as much lint, and the appearance 
between the acres fo watered, and the reft of the fame field, is 
moft remarkably in favour of the former ; and Mr Paterfon. 
is fo convinced of the advantage of this practice, that he has 
conftrucled a cart for this purpofe, upon the fame principle 
with thofe carts ufed in watering the ftreets of London. 

A large calk (a butt) is fixed upon ihafts, with a fet of 
low wheels, (old coach-wheels), for convenience of filling. 
In one end a hole is made of about two inches diameter, to 
which a fquare conductor is fixed, the middle part about 
6 inches long, with an opening of 2-i inches fquare, coming 
right outwards, and from which a tranfverfe arm of the 
fame dimenfions, and about 3 feet in length, is fixed clofc 
at both ends, but the fore part covered with a plate of iron, 
full of holes; and to guide the flow of this dung-water, a 
plug is fitted to the hole in the head of the calk, with its 
greateft end inwards ; through its body a ftrong cord pafies, 

knotted 

tion ; and added, that, at any time, he could make the curl by planting the 
feed too deep, or in wet poached ground ; and' yet, in the fame field which 
a farmer in this diftrict had let out to the neighbouring villagers, every 
man's proportion could have been known from the healthinefs of the plant* 
•r the contrary ; what could this be owing to, if not to the variety of the 
feed ? Thefe obfervations may be worth attending to. This difeafe has 
never been obferved amongft the yams. As it is of the utmoft confcquence 
to introduce fuch kinds of food for beftial, as may as little as poffible en- 
croach upon the neceflaries of life for man, it is hoped the length of this 
article will be excufed. 



Statiftical Account 



knotted at each end of the ping, to keep it from fhifting ; 
one end of this cord comes out at the bung of the cafk, and 
the other through the middle of the fore-arm ; and by the 
limpleft exertion of drawing the cord either outwards or 
inwards, the water within may be made to flow, or be 
flopped at pleafure. The calk may be filled with a bucket, 
and a long handle, made on purpofe, by which means the 
mod valuable part of the dung, which is generally loft, may 
be turned to great advantage j and by a particular contri- 
vance, even drilled turnip may be watered with this fimple 
machine. This year, 1796, when there was no appearance 
of rain in the turnip feed-time, it was put in practice at 
Caftle-Huntly with great advantage ; upon the iron plate 
on the front of the tranfverfe arm, a piece of thin wood was 
Jixed, fo as to cover the holes entirely, except afpace which 
was left near each of the two extremities, to each of which 
a flexible leather pipe, of about 18 inches long, was firmly 
nailed, and to the other end, the nofe of a common garden 
watering-pan was fixed. Thefe two pipes were attached 
to each other by a piece of fmall flick, fo as to make them 
move together, and, by a handle fixed to it, the man who 
drove, and who walked behind, guided them upon the two 
drills, one on each fide of the horfe. This operation may 
be repeated once or twice, according to the judgment of 
the farmer. 

Red Clover and Rye-grafs. — In fuch parks or inclofurear 
which are intended folely for paflure, white clover and 
ribbed grafs are commonly fown } and hay feeds, as they 
are called, have alfo been fown for the fame purpofe : But 
the grafs which makes a portion of the farm rotation, and 
which is recommended to be fown upon a fixth part of the 
clay grounds every year, is always underftood to be red 
clover and rye-grafs. From 16 to 25 pounds of red clo- 
ver.

ver, and if for hay, about a Mot (bufhel) of rye-grafs upon 
the Scotch acre ; but if it be meant to be cut for the beftial 
upon the farm, the fame quantity of clover feed, with one 
or two pecks of rye-grafs feeds, is enough. Tins is mod 
excellent food for horfes, cows, fheep, and pigs ; and if be- 
gun to be cut early upon loam, it will give two good crops ; 
and, upon clay grounds, it will, in general, in favourable 
feafons, give three crops before the froft fets in, and pro- 
bably a good after-grafs for pafture on both. This grafs- 
crop, as it is commonly called here, is meant for one year 
only •, and that part which is cut for hay, generally produ- 
ces very good crops, from 200 to 300 ftone, of 22 lb. Eng- 
lish each ftone, per acre •, and fuch part of it as is not ne- 
oeflary to be ufed at home finds a ready market at Dun- 
dee or Perth. It is perhaps worth while to mention a re- 
markable inftance of a crop of this kind upon the Mains of 
Caftle-Huntly. In the fpring of the year 1786, red clover 
and rye-grafs were fown amongft wheat in a field of 13 
Scotch acres, which produced 6000 ftone of hay •, and the 
fecond cutting of the fame field was fold at L. 2 : i 3 : 4 
Sterling per acre. 

Hay.— The beft time to cut the hay is when the clover is 
in flower, and before the rye-grafs feed is formed : For, at 
that period of vegetation, the plant itfelf, which is the ob- 
ject; for ufe, is full of its native juices, and, of courfe, con- 
tains more real nourifhment, than afterwards, when ex- 
haufted, to maturate the feed. It is alfo well known to ex- 
perience, that rye-grafs, when fuffered to feed, impoveriflies 
the ground exceedingly ; and when cut in the ftage recom- 
mended, an exceeding good fecond crop may be expected, 
otherwife not. If the farmer means to have rye-grafs feed 
of his own, he may fet apart a portion of his field on pur-

pofe, which he will find a much better plan For agricultural 
economy, than letting the crop remain longer upon tfec 
ground to ripen the feed. 

Clover W— It has been attempted to grow clover for 
feed m tins parifh, but not with fuch fuccefs as to encou- 
rage the experiment. For this purpofe, to have it as pure 
as poffible, the firft crop was early cut, that every other 
vegetable, which had a chance of feeding with the clover, 
might be deftroyed. The fecond crop then was to give 
the feed : But this made it often too late in the feafon for 
ripening; and after all, the difficulty of feparating the feed 
from the huik was exceedingly difcouraging. Whether the 
thr^lhing-mill would do this more efFeftually, remains to 
be tried. 

Winning Hay. — It is a common practice in this country, 
after their hay is cut, to let it lie for feveral days in the 
fwarth, as it is called, without touching it ; the only rea- 
fon given for which is, that it will turn a fliower in that 
ftate better than when teafed out, and left open upon the 
field. The leaft reflection may convince any one, th«t this 
is both faife reafoning, and bad practice. The great ob- 
ject in making hay, is to dry it as quickly as poffible, with 
all its native juices in it; and the mofl obvious method for 
this purpofe is, not to let it reft one moment after it is cut 
down, but to continue turning and turning it confiantly till 
dry ; ana 1 if it fhould get a fhower during this operation, 
when lying loofe and open, the rain will pafs through it, and 
be foon dried up by a fucceeding breeze and fun; and, at any 
rate, there is every probable chance of coiling, i. e. putting it 
in cocks, or getting it flacked in fafety fooner by thefe means 
than otherwifc. It is well known, that rain deftroys the na- 
tive juices of every plant, if expofed to it for any time ; and 
when hay is fuffered to lie in the fwarth, that part of it

which is undermoft neither fees fun nor feels air, while the 
upper partis blenched with both ; and, of courfe, as it muft 
remain much longer in the field before the under part is 
win, the upper part is loft; and alfo, it will be much longer 
expofed to accidents, from unfavourable weather ; the prac- 
tice, therefore, is bad, and the method above recommended 
in every fenfe preferable. 

timothy Grafs. — Timothy grafs has alfo been tried in 
this parilh ; but it yielded a coarfe vegetable, by no means 
to be compared with the rye-grafs upon the fame field, and 
while the laft remained, the Timothy was thrown out in 
the winter, and left nothing but bunches fcattered through 
the field *. 

Tares. 

* Cattle, as well as every other fpecies of beftial upon the farm, are fed 
upon clover in the houfe, befides their palture during the greateft part 
•f the fummer ; but great care mould be taken not to give it to them, 
while wet with rain, or to naffer cattle or cows to pafture upon young clo- 
ver while the morning dews remain upon the ground : For it is well 
known, that not only clover, but other fucculent vegetables, when ate by 
cattle in that ftate, are apt to produce fuch a fudden, and violent fermenta- 
tion in the ftornach, as to end in fatal confequences, if not timeoully pre- 
vented. 

Thin difeafeis evidently produced by an extraordinary and fudden diften- 
fion of the ftomach, from an immenfe quantity of fixed air let loofe by the 
fermentation of thofe fucculent vegetables; and as, from the nature and 
itricture of this vifcus, the more it is extended, the lefs capable it is to dis- 
charge any of its contents, of courfe, if not lpeedily relieved, the 
iifeafe increafes, until a rupture of the ftomach takes place, and death 
enfues. 

If foon obferved, by an apparent fwelling and elevation on the near fide, 
*ot far from the fpine, gentle exercife, by walking the animal about, very 
frequently, effects the cure ; probably by aflifting the periftaltic motion of 
the guts, and promoting a difcharge of wind and fceces per ano, which is 
the firft favourable fymptom of the difeafe going off. To aid this, many 
remedies have been thought of and propofed ; and amongft others, a pound 
of fweet butter, melted and mixed with 01. Anifi or 01. Junipiris, from one

Tares. — Upon the large farms, tares have lately been In- 
troduced and fown at different periods, fo as to come in for

to two ounces, poured down the throat, has been ufed with fuccefs. It has 
alfo been recommended, to fill an empty egg-fhell with tar, and to put it 
down the throat into the ftomach with the hand. This alfo has been attend- 
ed with fuccefs; and at Caftle-Huntly above a dozen of cattle were reco- 
vered upon the very firft experiment, after feeing this remedy recommended 
in the newfpapers. To give this-the better chance of fuccefs, the egg mull 
be kept whole in the hand, and prefied as far down as pofliblf, while the 
animal's head is kept up by thofe who aflift at the operation, and who may 
facilitate the introduction of the egg into the ftomach, by ftroaking the 
outfide of the throat downwards, after the hand which introduced the egg 
is removed ; — and it is remarkable, that as foon as the animal has performed 
deglutition, a quantity of foul ill fmelling air comes up, and very foon after 
the difeafe begins to abate and to go off. It has alfo been propofed to 
force a round flexible ftick into the ftomach, from the idea, that if its mouth, 
(». e. the mouth of the ftqmach), can be opened by any means, the cure 
will be effected ; which is a very reafonable conjecture. 

But Dr Monro at Edinburgh, the celebrated Profefibrof Anatomy in 
that Univerfity, has improved upon this. He recommends a flexible tube, made 
©f fpiral wire, and covered with leather ; to one end of which is fixed a brafs 
knob full of holes, which is meant to be introduced into the ftomach, and as 
the tube is flexible, it fits itfelf to the throat, and being hollow, a ftrong wire, 
with a probe point, can be introduced at the opening of the other end, 
by which it can be kept as clear and pervious as poflible. This is extreme- 
ly neceffary ; for without fome fuch means, the holes in the brafs nob, and 
perhaps the tube itfelf, might be filled by the vifcous mucilaginous mat- 
ter in the ftomach, and the intention totally defeated. However, at any 
rate, the introduction of this inftrument is a great point gained ; and the 
firft explolion of detached air through the tube, will molt probably give 
relief, while the wire keeps the paffage open, to render the remedy complete 
and more certain. Mr Walker in a book, publuhed in 1794, under the 
title of Rowlin's Cow Doctor, has'given a full account of this elaftic tube, 
copied from the Caledonian Mercury, into which it was inferted in March 
7702, with Dr Monro's permiflion ; and having got one of thefe tubes for 
black cattle from Mr Still, cutler in Edinburgh, who makes them for eight fliil- 
lings a-piece, he got fome iitch made on a fmaller fcale for Iheep, and tells us, 
p. 123. " that they have been found of infinite fervice in faving the lives 
" of iheep in-fougbt or brake-fought by which is undcrftood, the fwel- 
Iir.g of the ftoruuich, from the fermentation of the food.

feeding beftial, both horfes and cattle, after the firft crop of 
clover, and to continue in fucceffion until the fecond crop 

be 

Dr Monro bas, fince that time, contrived an inftrument of iron, made 
Hkewife by Mr Still, for keeping open the mouth of the animal ; by the 
ufe of which, it will be found much eafier to pafs the tube into the fto- 
mach ; which will give a better chance of fuccefs, than any thing hitherto 
recommended, and,' in molt cafes, may render fibbing unneceffaiy. 

The fuccefs of all thofe remedies, however, depend upon their being 'in- 
troduced into the ftomach, which is in many cafes difficult, and in fome, if 
the difeafe be gone too far before it is obferved, it becomes impofiible : 
There then remains no other hopes of relief, but by making an opening in 
the ftomach from without. This operation is here very common, 
and is frequently performed without much anatomical (kill in the ope- 
rator, and who in general is not very nice in the choice of his inftrument, 
taking the firft knife he can lay his hand upon ; but what is moft recom- 
mended, is a knife of about four or five inches long, and about one inch 
broad, with a ftiarp point and fixed in a handle. He then marks the place 
for the operation, by meafuring with his finger and thumb extended, 
a fpan from the prominent point of the hip-bone forwards, and a little 
downwaids, fo as to meet another fpan mea'fured from the fpine or back- 
bone outwards, and at the point where thefe meet, with one bold ftroke of 
his inftrument, he penetrates the ftomach ; the imprifoned air immediate- 
ly nifties out, and the animal is relieved. 

This, although a coarfe operation, is certainly fo far effectual, as it faves 
the animal's life : but if a milch cow, no more milk can be expected from 
her that feafon ; and it is fometimes very long before any defcription of cat- 
tle recover the effects, either of the difeafe or the operation, or perhaps of 
both. Sometimes it is neceffary to keep the wound open for fome time, be- 
fore all the air be let out ; and fometimes it fuppurates, and becomes very 
troublefome to heal. It would feem to be a very great improvement on this 
operation, were a trocar ufed inftead of the knife, and made on purpofe lar- 
ger than common, and which every man who has cattle Ihould be always pro- 
vided with The operation then might eafily be performed, and with great 
certainty. The trocar itfelf might be withdrawn immediately after the ope- 
ration, while the tube remained to give a free pafiage to all the air in the 
ftomach; and the t wound, in all probability, would give no trouble, but heal 
directly. 

Cattle are fubject to other difeafes ; but they are little underftood in this 
part of the country. A cow 8 years old was taken ill July laft. The firft 
fymptom of difeafe was her loathing her food ; and on examination it was

the flat vetch ; the large and fmall round tare ; the laft 
kind has hitherto been found the beft, both for fodder and 
feed. They are a mod excellent food, and much liked 
both by cattle and horfes.

Winter Tares.— Mr Mylne of Mylnefield is the only 
in this parifti who has tried winter tares. They are fown 
about Oftober, and may be cut about May. He thinks 

them 

found, that flie had been coftive for fometime, had a dullnefs and heavinefs 
in her eyes, and was very much hide-bound. Some medicines were given 
for her coftivenefs, which anfwered very well; but her difeafe increafing, 
a celebrated cow-doctor, from a neighbouring parifh, by trade a weaver, was 
fent for. After examination, he declared herto be elvelhot; and although he 
pretended to point out the very holes under the nun through which the elvan 
arrow had pafled, yet Ihe was not fo bad as many he had feen, and there- 
fore he prefcribed and adminiftered, but without effect : For foon after 
a very large fwelling was difcovered between the forelegs, upon the brilket, 
which feltfoft and pulpy. The cow went off her food entirely, her pulfe 
quick, breathing fhort, and in a few days flie died. On dividing the brifi 
ket, it was found full of a glary, jelatinous fubftanee, and very much enlar- 
ged : and upon opening the thorax, the pericardium appeared extended to 
an immenfe fize, fo as to occupy the whole left divifion entirely. On 
puncturing it a yellowifh fluid iffued out, which could not have meafured 
lefs than 6 or 8 Scotch pints (3 or 4 Englifh gallons), fo that the cow died 
of a hydrops pericardii. 

On examining the cow-doctor, he faid he had often feen elvelhot cows, 
fome of which he had cured. That he had feen fame drop down dead up- 
on the fpot : That he had frequently felt the impreffion made by the elvaa 
arrow under the Ikin ; for they can wound even mortally without any ex- 
ternal appearance : That others he had feen with their whole body as foft 
as wool, (his own expreffion) after death : That he had frequently picked 
up thofe arrows, which were fmooth triangular fmall pointed ftones or 
pebbles, like flints; and it was his belief, that thofe who do the mifchkf 
are our goodly neighbours. 

From this it will appear, that the belief in the exiftcnce of fairies is not yet 
quite extinguifhed in this country; but they have been very unjuftly blamed 
for killing cattle, as a ftroke of lightning is a much more natural way of ac- 
counting for the mifchief, which however was beyond the fphere of their 
knowledge when this notion was very prevalent ; and the triangular pe! 
bles are as innocent a.s our goodly neighbours.

them the beft food he ever tried for working horfes. The 
fheep are fo very fond of them, that they may be faid to 
devour them ; and for a week after they were taken off 
from them, they did not eat the moft fucculent grafs with 
any relifli : they even preferred them to red clover, which, 
of all others, ufed to be reckoned their moft favourite 
food. 

Lime. — Lime is now univerfally ufed as a manure in this 
parifh ; and, after repeated trials, many good farmers feem 
difpofed to prefer the Charleftown, becaufe they think it 
contains fand, which makes it fitter for opening the texture 
of clay than the Englifh from Sunderland, efpecially the 
whiteft kind, which they think contains chalk*. The quan- 
tity is, in general, 30 bolls South Sunderland lime, barley 
meafure, and 45 or 50 bolls Charleftown, wheat meafure, 
per acre, which is laid upon fallow after the dung is plough- 
ed in, and then harrowed, to divide and mix it ; after which 
a very fhallow feed-furrow prepares it for fowing. This 
may laft for two rotations ; that is, twelve years or more, 
according to circumftances ; but fome are of opinion, that 
it would be a good practice to give every fallow on clay 
about 10 or 12 bolls of lime, harrowed in, in the fame man- 
ner. Upon this practice experience muft decide. 

In ufing lime as a manure, many good farmers are of opi- 
nion that it ought not to be too much drenched with water, 
but laid on as hot as poffible, efpecially in clay, and har- 
rowed in immediately, to mix it with the foil : By which 
means, the more complete flacking of the lime would be 
left to the fucceeding rains, and it would then be more inti- 
mately mixed with the foil j and the clay, particularly, 

would 

* The greateft fault of the Charleftain lime, is the vaft quantities of 
Yolks (unburned ftone) it contains. The palion or blue lime, is mucli 
more in requeft here than any other ; expence from a s. 40". to as. 6d.per 
boll, and about 30 bolls per acre. 



544 Statijlicdl Account 

would be much better diffolved by the operation. Even 
fome farmers have propofed to powder the burning lime- 
fhells, inftead of flacking them, to anfwer this purpofe more 
effectually. 

All black loam, fand, or any kind of earthy fubftance 
almoft, proves to be very good manure for clay ; from its 
leffening its tenacity upon being mixed with it, and by 
that means brings a greater quantity of its prolific parts 
into action ; and clay carried to poor foil, or to mofly 
grounds, proves a very ufeful manure. 

Marl. — Marl has alfo been tried on clay, but without ad- 
vantage. It anfwers well upon lighter lands, as far as 50 
bolls (a cube of two feet each) per acre ; and in much lefs 
quantity, it makes an excellent top-drefiing for grafs. 

Compojls.— Com pods are not much in ufe in this parifh. 
But dunghills have been made up of different materials, 
fuch as, earth, rubbifh from old houfes, dung from the 
ftraw-yard, and, in fome few inftances, lime, rubbifh, or 
marl •, but the praaice is not general, and as yet it is not 
confirmed by experience. 

Dung, Hints to Landlords.- -Dung never mould be per- 
mitted to go off the farm. The ftraw now, fince threfhing- 
m iUs came into general ufe, is fit for fodder or dung only. 
The incoming tenant mould have leave to fow grafs feeds 
in i-6th of the farm, without any claim or demand by the 
outgoing tenant. If the Landlord gives him leave to fell 
his Ll crop upon its foot, /. e. Handing corn and fodder he 
' fhould be obliged to fell it by public roup (au&amp;on), that the 
incoming tenant, or any one on the barony, may have an op- 
en of buying it if they pleafe. If he chufes to threfhu o£ 
Luld be done on the farm, and the fodder either fold by 
hlic roup or to the incoming tenant by appratfemcnt. 
S - excellent regulation, if every new tenant

were enabled to enter with a proportion of fallow on clay, 
as well as grafs ; and with the dung in the ftraw-yard, in 
the fame way as if the outgoing tenant were to continue. 
This Mr Paterfon has been enabled to do, upon two farms, 
by buying the dung, and a proportion of fallow, from the 
creditors of an outgoing bankrupt-tenant *, and giving 
them to his fucceffors, and taking them bound in their 
tacks (Ieafes) to leave the dung and the fallow on the fame 
terms at the expiry of their leafe. 

Inclofures. — In the upper part of this parilh, many of the 
farms are inclofed and fubdivided with hedges and ftone 
dikes, (fences) ; and indeed there are fome few hedges 
round the extremities of the farms in the low Carfe ; but, 
in general, every other fence but the ditch is reprobated 
by Carfe farmers. They fay, that the hedges not only 
harbour numberlefs fmall birds, which deftroy a great deal 
of corn j but they prevent the wind from drying their clay 
ground in fpring, and winning their corns in autumn, 
which they think of much more conference than any fhel- 
ter their protection can afFord againit making winds. 

Cheefe and Butter, — Very tolerable cheefe is made in 
this parifh, and a confiderable quantity of excellent butter, 
which are difpofed of to private families, efpecially the 
butter, which is in great requeft, or fent to the Dundee 
market. It has been a general opinion, that very good 
butter can alone be made from the milk of cows fed upon 
very old pafture ; but the greater part of the butter made 
in this parifh, which is acknowledged to be excellent, is 
made from the milk of cows fed upon clover, of one or two 
years at moft : For here the clover is fown with the barley ;

the following year it gives a crop of hay, or is cut for the 
horfes or cows, and is' afterwards ploughed up for the crop 
of oats or wheat to follow ; fo that the farmers here have 
no old grafs. 

Bees. — Bees thrive well in this parifh, and produce ex- 
cellent honey ; and in the gardens at Caftle-Huntly, where 
there are a variety of fragrant flowers, particularly great 
quantities of minionette, fown on purpofe, honey has been 
got little inferior to Minorca, both in colour and flavour. 

Hops. — It is very probable hops might thrive here, as, in 
many p aces, the foil is abundantly rich for that purpofe \ 
but Jhv/ter is wanting. 

Seed time. — Seed-time for wheat, September, in the clay ; 
October, and even November, on the brae land ; accord- 
ing to the feafon, which they are nioft anxious to catch, 
elpecially in clay, while the ground is dry, otherwife 
they run a rifle of lofing it altogether : But in the loam or 
brae land, they do not wilh to fow before the middle of 
Oclober ; and good farmers are not anxious that fuch 
grounds mould be too dry, but rather prefer moifture, 
mould the harrows even trail, while they are fowing; as 
they think it a great mean of preventing annual weeds from, 
ruming up amongft the crop. Beans are frequently fown 
in the clay upon the wbeat-ftubble in hroad caft,^and plough- 
ed in about the end of February, or beginning of March, that 
is, as foon as the plough can touch the ground; and about a 
fortnight, or a longer time afterwards, fome farmers fow 
hafty peafe upon the fame furrow, and harrow them in, 
after which very good crops have been gotten * alio, drill- 
ing beans may be ufed to great advantage upon clay, but 
the ground fliould be prepared by a winter furrow, and in

thefpring by another furrow, as early as the feafon will per- 
mit ; immediately after which it is harrowed, then plough- 
ed acrofs the ridges, and the beans fown in every third fur- 
row *: After fowing, harrow the field well, and then let it 
lie until the beans be near appearing through the ground ; 
then harrow it again to deftroy the annuals ; anH after the 
beans appear diftinaiy, hand-hoe them, harrow between, 
the drills with a narrow harrow, and proceed as in dreffing 
other drilled crops, tfpon black land, beans are fown in ge- 
nerally in longitudinal drills, in the month of March ; peafe, 
March and April '; oats, March and April; barley, from 
April to June, according to the fpecies of the grain •, the 
Lincolnfhire fhould be fown very early. Grafs feeds, which, 
confift of rye-grafs and red clover, are generally fown with 
the barley, becaufe the ground is better prepared ; but they 
anfwer fully as well with oats f , or even among wheat, 
when fown early in the fpring ; the ground being firft open- 
ed with a light harrow, and then rolled in ; which operation 
is, in general, of great advantage to the wheat, as it opens 
the foil, and makes the young plants Jloch or tillar better. 

The principal reafon of fowing the grafs feeds amongft 
barley, is probably on account of the rotation of fixes. How 
far this practice ought to be adhered to, or if any variation 
may be introduced with fuccefs, the experience of farmers 
mult judge. But, in general, the barley in clay is but an 
indifferent crop, and therefore fome farmers are trying 
early oats in their room, or even common oats, which, in 
general, gives the beft crop* 

Pickling 

* This is by much the beft method upon clay, as evtfry drill, nay, every 
lurrow, ferves as a drain, and keeps the ground perfectly dry ; as all the 
ram will tall into the furrows between the ridges, which nuift be kept open 
for that purpofe. 

f Perhaps the crop of grafs is more certain, as it has a better chance from 
the fpring rains. 



548 Statiftical Account 

Pickling Seed Wbeat.-M\ the wheat for feed undergoes 
* preparation, which here they call pickling, i. , they 
pnnkle it with ftale urine, and then riddle powdered quick- 
iime upon it, turning it all the time with fhovels, until the 
gram be completely covered with a white cruft. It is then 
earned out to the field, and fown immediately. This has 
been an eftablifhed practice for many years, and it is fol- 
lowed, from experience of its utility. It is very probable 
thai it ferves to quicken vegetation, and to prevent vermin 
from deftroying the feed. It is alfo a good practice to 
fwim the feed in a ftrong brine, or pickle, of fea fait, made 
ftrong enough to bear an egg, to take off all the light grain, 
which fwims on the furface, and then lime the reft for 
feed. 

Smut in Wheat.— The operation of pickling has been fup- 
pofed an effectual remedy againft fmut (blake) in wheat; 
but it certainly is not fo. Whatever may be the caufe of 
this difeafe is difficult to fay ; but it is by no means pecu- 
liar to wheat ; it is very remarkable in barley, and alfo in 
oats ; but amongft them it quite difappears in the threfhing, 
and therefore is not noticed. Sound ears have been found, 
to all appearance from the fame root, and even fome found 
grains of wheat upon the fame ear with fmut. Some have 
thought it was an infect, and that it was infectious, and if 
fown with other feed would produce fmutty corn: This is 
not true, for the experiment has been fairly tried here, of 
fmutty and found wheat mixed, and even fome of the fmut 
bruifed, and the crop did not differ in any refpedt from the 
reft of the field. It may be in fome refpects from the fea- 
fon, and in fome from the feed ; perhaps from fome imper- 
fection in the maturation of particular grains, totally im- 
perceptible to us, the caufes of which we are ignorant of, and 
which may never be in the power of man to remedy. The

Left prevention, perhaps, in our power is found feed; to ob- 
tain which, fwimming in brine feems to be an excellent 
method; but, as it is alfo probable that the pungency of 
the ftale urine, incrufted with lime, maybe a prote&amp;ion to 
the feed from various infe&amp;s, while it promotes vegetation, 
were both operations combined, it might be of advantage. 
After the wheat is fwimmed, and the found heavy part 
alone referved for feed, let it be dried by frequent turning 
in the barn-floor ; then, when dry, fprinkle it with the 
ftale urine and lime, as already mentioned. It is very pro- 
bable the good confequences will repay the fanner for all 
his labour. 

On fallow well prepared, 6 pecks to half a boll of wheat 
may be fown upon the Scotch acre, according to the foil 
and feafon, of which the farmer muft judge. If .after clo- 
ver, peafe, or beans, or later in the feafon, more feed will 
be neceflary. 

Harvefiing. — The {hearers are generally hired for the 
whole harveft, and their wages have, fince 1780, varied 
from 20 s. to the men, to 30 s. and upwards ; and to the 
women, from 14 s. to 20 s. ; and if by the day, from 1© d. 
to 20 d. or more, to the men ; and from 6 d. to is. to the 
Women.

Viftuals^~-A\\ the fhearers get bread and beer in the field, 
i. e. a choppin (of about an Englifti quart) of beer, and the 
bread of 1.14th of a peck of oatmeal for breakfaft ; and for 
dinner, 3 mutcbkins (pints) of beer, and i-i4th of a peck 
of meal in bread ; and with fome, it is alfo a practice to 
get half a lippie of oatmeal every night, 1. e. i-8th of a 
peck, while the harVeft lafts, for their fupper, which they 
may either ufe, or take home to their families. Harveft

ufually lafts from 1 6 to 20 days, unlets the weather be ufi, 
commonly bad. Some farmers in this neighbourhood have 
at times got perfons to contradl to cut down their corns at 
a certain fum per acre, from 5 s. to 6 s. ; but thefe are few, 
and it is now, in general, given up, probably from want of 
hands. 

The expence of harveft muft vary according to the price 
of vicinal, and the ftate of the weather. If the oatmeal be 
dear, it will coft more, and vice verfa ; and if the weather 
be bad, and draw the harveft out to a much longer period 
than ufual, it will coft more. 

In 1780, upon a farm in this parifh, the harveft coft 5 s. 
per acre.

And fince that time it has been as high as 9 s. and 10 s. per 
acre, including the whole expence of bringing the corns 
into the barn-yard. 

Maiden Feq/l. — It was, till very lately, the cuftom to 
give what was called a Maiden Feaft, upon the finifhing of 
the harveft; and to prepare for which, the lafl; handful of 
corn reaped in the field was called the Maiden. This was 
generally contrived to fall into the hands of one of the 
fineft girls in the field ; was dreffed up in ribbands, and 
brought home in triumph, with the mufic of fiddles or bag- 
pipes. A good dinner was given to the whole band, and 
the evening fpent in jovialty and dancing, while the for- 
tunate lafs who took the maiden was the Queen of the 
feaft ; after which, this handful of corn was drefted out, 
generally in the form of a crofs, and hung up, with the

date of the year, in fome confpicuous part of the houfe. 
This cuftom is now entirely done away ; and in its room, 
to each (hearer is given 6 d. and a loaf of bread. However, 
fome farmers, when all their corns are brought in, give 
their fervants a dinner, and a jovial evening, by way of 
Har vert- home. 

Expence of 'Thrqjhmg.— ThraflVing out the corns ufed to 
be a very expenfive article, efpecially when done by la- 
bourers on day-wages ; but the general practice was a 2jth 
part of the grain. Upon a farm in this pariih, of 180 acres, 
it coft, on an average of 6 years, about L, 32, very nearly 
2 s. 6 d. per acre. This operation is now performed en- 
lirely by the threfhing-mill. 

Roads. — Previous to the year 1790, all the roads through 
the Carfe of Gowrie were exceedingly bad ; and the whole 
ftatute labour of this pariih was found infufficient to uphold 
the four miles of poft road which panes through it. That 
year an act of Parliament was obtained to make certain 
roads in the county of Perth turnpike, and amongfl others 
the road through the Carfe from Perth to Dundee, and its 
three branches, leading to the harbours of Polgavie, Errol, 
and Inchyra ; which, by the liberal fubfcription and un- 
wearied attention of the proprietors, are now made equal 
to the beft roads in the kingdom, but at the expence of 
L. 13,000 to the Carfe proprietors, who are truftees. Since 
that time the truftees have made it a rule to apply the 
ftatute labour, through the whole Carfe, folely to the bye- 
roads, or other roads of communication. In the parim of 
Longforgan, not only this rule has been obferved, but the 
heritors have contributed largely for the fame purpofe, to 
the amount of feveral hundred pounds; by which means 
feyeral of thefe roads, already made are very little inferior 



552 



Statijlical Account 



to the turnpike ; and as the whole of what has been projec- 
ted is now carrying into execution, the communication from 
the different parts of this parifh, and indeed through the 
whole Carfe, with the neighbouring market towns and har- 
bours, will be fo eafy to the farmer, as to account in a great 
meafure for the rife of the value of land in this part of the 
country. This mould ferve as an encouragement to coun» 
try gentlemen to exert themfelves in making good roads, 
as the greateft improvement,, and bell laid out money they 
can expend upon their eftates \ as it enables the farmer to 
perform all his labour at much lefs expence, and of eourfe 
to pay a better rent without diminifhing his profits *. One 
remark here is neceflary, that in this parifh, and indeed in 
general through the Carfe, care has been taken to apply the 
flatute labour of each farmer, as much as poflible, to thofe 
roads alone moft ufeful to him. 

General 

* It is a well known fact that previous to the year 1790, a great part of 
the interior of the Carfe of Gowrie was perfectly inaccefllble to carts for 
almoft half the year ; fo that they were obliged to deliver their produce on 
borfeback ; and the very idea of bringing lime or dung from any diftance 
was fcarce to be entertained, except under the moft favourable circumftan- 
ces. Now there is not a farm in the Carfe but what is acceflible in every 
point, and at all times, to carts loaded with 13 or 14 bolls of wheat, or 10 
bolls of barley, or 4^ bolls of lime ftiells, or 16 cubic feet of dung, at leaft, 
and at a moft trifling expence ; for within the county, the turnpike toll is 
but 9 d. for which a cart with two holies can deliver produce, or bring 
lime, &amp;c. from fome one part or other, to almoft any place in the Carfe, to 
the extent of three loads in fummer, of the above amount, and two in winter, 
per day : For roads of communication they pay nothing. Is it poflible 
.then to point out the advantage of good roads to farmers in ftronger terms ? 
and, Is there any one man of any defcription, who feels thatadvantage more ?

General Produce, and Expence of Labour 1 . — The crops 
raifed in this parifli are good in general : Upon the clay- 
ground, on an average from 7 to 8 bolls per acre; and on 
the loam, different according to the quality of the foil, 
and the fkill of the farmer : But the expence is very great, 
being no lefs than L. 3, or L. 3, 3 s. per acre. This may 
in a great meafure be owing to the very high wages of fer- 
vants, both male and female ; which has increafed of late to 
an extraordinary degree : Farm fervants wages were in 1780, 
about L, 5.

within thefe 15 years, wages have been doubled and more. 
The farm fervants indeed are now better clothed, and in 
every refped make a much better appearance : It is much 
to be wiihed, that their good behaviour and induilry would 
keep pace with their encouragment, which is not always the 
cafe.

Ancient State of the Carfe.— There is a tradition univer- 
fally prevalent through this part of the country, that for- 
merly the river Tay occupied a very different bed from what it

does at prefent. That it entered the Carfe weftwardof 
Inchyra, and fhaped its courfe along thofe grounds which 
are ftill hollow, and remarkably low between the eftates of 
Glencarfe and Pitfour ; that it approached the hills at Glen- 
doick, and continued fkirting them eaftward by Pitroddy, 
Flawcraig, Craigdilly, Ballendean, Baledgarno, and Rome. 
That at the Snabs of Drimmie, itfent off" a portion of its wa- 
ters, which entered this parifh between the hills of Forgarr 
and Dron, directing its courfe eaftward through that vale, 
and after receiving feveral burns or rivulets in its paflage, 
emptied itfelf into ks parent river at Invergowrie, or the 
mouth of the Gowrie. 

That the river Earn continued its feparate courfe till it 
■was joined by the Tay below Errol r That the whole low 
grounds of the Carfe of Gowrie were then covered with 
water, out of which arofe a number of iflands or inches, 
which retain their names to this day, fuch as, Inchyra, or 
InchfherifF, Inchcoonins, Inchmichael, Megginch, Inch- 
martin, and Inchture : That the rock upon which Caftle- 
Huntly now ftands was then waited with water ; and that 
the ftones of which the original fortalice was built were 
brought by boats from Kingoody. 

There is no written teftimony known to the author of 
this paper which confirms this tradition v but Heftor Boe- 
theus, when mentioning the lands given to the Hays, an- 
ceftors of the prefent Earl of Kinnoul, for their gallant be- 
haviour at the battle of Luncarty, which was fought fome 
time in the tenth century, fays, that they got a falcon's 
flight :  She flew between Inchyra and Rome, a town four 
♦ miles weft of Dundee, and To they gat all the lands be- 
« tween Errol and the Tay.' If this be correct, it favours 
the conjeaure, that the Tay then came fomewhere near 
Rome, and that the greateft part of the Carfe was included 
in the royal gift. However, there are a number of other 

circumftancea 



of Longforgan. 555 



circumftances which would feem to give countenance to 
the tradition. The fuppofed original bed of the river, not- 
withftanding the diftance of time when this change is faid 
to have happened, and the improvements of thefe 50 years 
back, is ftill low, morally, and fwampy, almoft through its 
whole courfe. In many places, it is actually covered with 
water ftill ; and it abounds with the fame i'pecies of marfh- 
reed, which grows upon the verge of the river Tay, about 
Errol, Monorgan, Seafide, &amp;c. Upon feveral places near 
the hills are found fand banks and gravel, particularly at 
Glencarfe, Rait, Caftle-Huntly, in the vale between For- 
gan and Dron, &amp;c. ; and the upper furface of the low Carfe 
ground is a perfecT: clay, very much of the fame nature 
with that depofited in the bed of the prefent river, which 
is expofed to view by the reflux of the tide ; while thofe 
rifing grounds, ftill called Inches, confift of a rich black 
loam, mixed with gravel, the under ftratum of which is till 
and red ftone rock. There is a blufF point in the eaft part 
of this parilh, in the courfe of that branch, which is fuppo- 
fed to have been the Gowrie, called Denmark to this day, 
and where the country people fay the Danes landed, but 
which at prefent is more than a mile from the river, and 
no water near it, but a fmall rapid rivulet. Even Forgan 
is fuppofed to owe its name to the .dividing of the river, 
from the Gaelic pronunciation of the word; and it is faid, 
that there are charters, one for Bambfiqh in Fife, now upon 
the fouth bank of the Tay, but which formerly was faid to 
be bounded by the Earn or Ironfide ; and another, either 
for Flawcraig or Craigdilly, where, it is faid, iron rings had 
been found fixed in the rocks, for faftening mips, and that in 
the charter there is the remarkable expreffion— Uli olvrt 
naves ligahantur. 

Whether there be any truth in thefe, or if there be, at 
what period this great change upon the Carfe happened, is 



55^ Statijiical Accoimt 

not eafy to fay ; although it is faid (upon what authority is 
not known to the author of this paper) to have taken place 
fome time in the twelfth century, or earlier, as fome are in- 
ch- ed to fuppofe. But it is remarkable, that feveral of 
thole lflands have Chriftian names, while the places upon 
the rifing grounds and hills, fuppofed then to have bounded 
the river, are evidently more ancient, and probably origi- 
nal'Gaelic ; the names of many of them being defcriptive of 
their fituation in that language. And if there are charters 
which contain any fuch exprefilons as thole mentioned, the 
period mult have been very remote, and might actually 
have happened in the twelfth century, or earlier. 

Monorgan might have been at that time a much larger 
eftate, which indeed is extremely probable ; for even in the 
memory of men now living, many acres of that eftate have 
been carried away by the river. Great encroachments 
have alfo been made upon other eftates in the Carfe from 
the fame caufe. Hence it is alfo very probable, that 
the fpacious bay between Errol and Kingoody has acquired 
its prefent extent and lhape, by the united exertions of the 
Tay and Earn, oppofed to the flood-tide from the fea. 

The various fubftrata in this diftricT: might likewife be a 
fubjecl: of curious investigation. By an examination lately 
taken at the braes of Monorgan and Polgavie, where the 
river Tay has made its greateft encroachments, and where 
the banks are from 19 to 20 feet perpendicular height, the 
following ftrata can be dittinftly traced : ijt, A brownifh 
clay, mixed with (and and vegetable earth, about i# feet 
deep, forming the prefent prolific upper furface. 2d, About 
four feet deep of a brownifh free clay, with a proportion of 
fand, but no vegetable matter. The only difference be- 
tween thefe two- is probably owing to cultivation, manure, 
fun and air. 3d, About 2 feet 3 inches of a poor yellowifh 
clay, without fand, but mixed with cockle, mufcle, and 



of Longf organ. 557 

other marine {hells, but no vegetable fubftances. qth, A 
ftrong blue clay, 34- feet deep, containing fea fhells, and 
roots of vegetables, the growth of which would feem tp 
have been checked by the fuperincumbent ftratum. 5th, 
Alfo a ftrong blue clay, with yellowifli feams in it, about 
5 feet deep, and containing a much greater proportion of ve- 
getable fubftances than the 4th ftratum, but under like cir- 
cumftances. The river rifes to the furface of this ftratum 
in ftream tides. 6th, Three feet deep of the fame kind of 
ftrong blue clay, mixed with more than double the quantity 
of vegetable roots than in the jth ftratum, but which alfo 
feem to have been born down, and their vegetation extin- 
guifhed by fome fuperior preffure. Thefe three are fepa- 
rated from each other by a fmall feam of fand and clay, 
which forms a pretty exacl: line of divifion, and through 
which the vegetable roots do not feem to have palled. 7^, 
A real peat mofs, near four feet deep, quite full of various 
kinds of vegetables, with roots, trunks, and branches of trees ; 
the furface of which forms the bed of the Tay ; in many 
places of which the mofs can be difHn&amp;ly traced, perfectly 
entire, clean, and firm, without having received the leaft 
injury from the flux and reflux of the tide ; and out of which, 
at other places, great quantities of peats for fuel have been 
dug at different periods, and are fo ftill. It is very re- 
markable, that in this ftratum many roots of large trees 
are to be found, principally allar (alder) and birch, at 
about 13 feet diftant from each other, perfectly upright, in 
the fame fituation in which the trees had originally grown, 
With their ramifications extended among the mofs, and fome 
of their fmaller fibres penetrating the clay below. The 
trunks and branches of the trees lying horizontally are all 
frefh, and have the appearance of having been borne down 
and laid flat by fome powerful caufe ; and what is alfo

very remarkable, many of the roots ieem to have had their 
trunks cut off about fix inches above the original furface.

Antiquities. 

* A man now living, and 72 years of age, who has funk 23 pit wells in 
feveral parts of the Carfe, fays, that after he penetrated the cultivated fur- 
face, he always found about ten feet of brownifli clay, without vegetable 
mixture, under that blue clay with vegetable roots and fea fliells, and ge- 
nerally at about 19 feet deep he found peat mofs from 3 to 9 inches deep ; 
then, blue clay again with vegetable roots, of different depths from 9 in- 
ches to 6 feet, and under^ that about two feet deep of peat mofs again, 
compofed of oak, fir, beech and hazel wood. That he has feen taken out 
of this mofs deers horns, (kulls and other bones. Below this mofs he ge- 
nerally found blue clay and quick-fand tinged black with the mofs. The 
wells he dug were from 16 to 34 feet deep ; and when he fell in with 
quick-fand before he came to the mofs, he generally found , at about 1 6 
feet deep, a fpring of pure foft water, free of any mineral tafte ; but 
when he was obliged to go deeper, and to penetrate the mofs before he 
found a fpring, the water had a mineral tafte, and when mixed cold with 
fpirits, it turned them as black as ink. This man alfo fays, he has frequent- 
ly feen oak and fir trees taken out of the braes, after being uncovered by 
the tide. 

In the year 17S0, when digging in a fwamp at Caftle-Huntly, to make a 
piece of water, about fix feet below the furface, a very large oak tree was 
found, lying with its top eaftward. That part of it which lay acrofs the 
excavation appeared to be the two laige top branches, of about 1^ feet in 
diameter ; the trunk of which miift have been of very large dimeniions. 
The branches u ere cut oujraiid taken up, and were found to be hard and 
frem, bu* ~ " -k as eoorfyv "The body of the tree was fuffered to remain,

rious. It is from this moffy ftratum of vegetable fubftances, no doubt, that 
the marfli reed rifes, and fhews itfelf in many fields through the Carfe ; as 
they are found to be fo deep, as to defeat every attempt to get them rooted

Antiquities.— The remains of antiquity in this parifh are 
but few. Caftle-Huntly, already defcribed, is the only 
building which has any claim to antiquity, fince the old 
church at Longforgan was taken down. In the midft of a 
plantation of firs, which was part of the muir of Forgan 
about 30 years ago, is a tumulus or barrow ; its central 
mound about 5 or 6 yards high, and 28 yards diameter ; 
the furrounding ditch, out of which probably the earth had 
been taken for its formation, 10 yards wide. It ftill bears 
the name of the Market Knowe, (knoll), as the markets 
were held there formerly ; and the country people remark, 
that although the whole ground round it was then covered 
with heath and broom, the Knowe always preferved a 
beautiful green fward. Some openings have been made in 
it, and coffins found, confifting of four rude longitudinal 
ftones, and two fmaller ones at each end, containing human 
Ikeletons. 

A few years ago there was found, fomewhere about this 
tumulus, an earthen pot, containing 700 filver pieces, about 
the fize of a fixpence. Upon one fide a head crowned, with 
Edward, very diftinftj and on the reverfe a crofs, with .*. 
in each divifion, and round it, London Civitas, very plain ; 
and four pieces, alfo of filver, fame fize ; on one fide a 
crowned head, round it, Alexander Dei gratia ; and on the 
reverfe a crofs, with a ftar of fix rays in each divifion, and 
round it, Scotorum Rex, very plain. Thefe were found by 
a man in this parifh, whofe bufinefs gave him frequent op- 
portunities to be about the place, and privately fold to a 
fhopkeeper in Dundee for L. 10 or L. 11 ; and it was by the 
greateft accident the circumflance came very lately to the 
knowledge of the author of this paper, who has now a 
piece of each in his poffeffion. He had his information firft 
from a very refpe&amp;able tradefman in Dundee, who is alfo 
an ingenious antiquary, who faw them all counted, about

two or three years ago, and kept the two pieces, from which 
this defcnption is taken. He added, that they were all in a 
ftate of high preservation. This was accompanied with 
another piece of curious information ; that, nearly about the 
fame time, there was found in the parifh of Invererity, in 
the county of Forfar, juftfuch another pot, containing ex- 
aftly the fame number of the fame filver coin, viz. 700 of 
Edward P. and four of Alexander. Upon which he made 
an ingenious conjefture, that thefe depofits, very probably, 
had been the wealth of two brothers, Who had divided it 
equally, and had hid it each in his own parifh, and had been 
killed during the troubles in thofe days. 

About a dozen years ago, in making a new road through 
a fandy hill between this parifh and the parifh of Rome, 
fome coffins, of the kind above mentioned, were found, 
alfo containing human fkeletons, and fome pieces of money, 
both filver and copper. The filver, about the fize of a 
fixpence of Henry IV. very legible. Some of the copper, 
with jfe/r de lis, but no legible infcription ; and fome which 
appeared to have been hammered only, quite rude, and 
without any mark of infcription or figure, both about the 
fame fize with the filver coin. 

Upon the eaftern boundary of this parifh, but now in the 
parifh of Benvie, is the remains of a fort, or fortified camp, 
evidently Roman, from its fquare fhape, and its name, Cot- 
ter Meltie, certainly a corruption of gh/atuor Mille. 

At about three miles diftance, and upon the top of the 
hill of Dron, is the remains of a fortification, which appears 
to have been built of rude ftones and turf. It is roundifh, 
or rather oval, following the fhape of the hill, and occupy- 
ing a fpace of about two Scotch acres ; towards the fouth it 
has three retrenchments, or banquets, rifing above one an- 
other, as the hill afcends. It is now planted, and will very 
foon be totally obliterated. This, with another, fomething

of the fame kind, in the adjoining parifh of Abernyte, and 
that on Dunfinnan-hill, might have been part of a chain of 
ports, running diagonally acrofs that range of hills from the 
Carfe to Strathmore. Thefe, from their fhape, muft either 
have been Dantfh or Scottilh ; moft probably the latter, as 
they prefent a face to the point of invafion. There is alfo 
a ruin near Lochtown, about which even tradition is filent. 

The parimes, in general, would appear to have been 
.much fmaller formerly than now. For, at Dron, there is 
the remains of a church or chapel, and burying-ground ; 
and upon the grounds of Monorgan, alfo in this parilh, there 
is the remains of a burying-ground, which moft likely had 
a chapel attached to it. 

There is alfo, in a field near Forgan, a tombftone, cover- 
ing a grave or graves, where the country people fay fome 
perfons were buried, who died of the plague laft century. 
It had an infcription to that purpofe, but is now defaced. 

About 16 or 17 years ago, digging fome trenches pretty 
deep for drains upon the bank below the eaft end of For- 
gan, were found fome large ftones, lying in fuch an arrange- 
ment, as gave the appearance of the foundation of a large 
budding, which is fuppofed to have been fome religious 
eftabhftiment. 

There is a very refpeftable man in Longforgan, of the 
name of Smith, a weaver, and the farmer of a few acres of 
land, who has in his poffeffion a ftone, which is called Wal- 
lace's ftone. It is what was formerly called in this country 
a bearjlone, which is made hollow like a large mortar, and 
was made ufe of to unhuik the bear or barley, as a pre- 
paration for the pot, with a large wooden mell, long before 
barley-mdls were known. Its ftation was on one fide of 
,the door, and covered with a flat ftone for a feat, when no,

hiflory of which is, that upon this ftone Wallace fat in his 
way from Dundee, when he fled, after killing the gover- 
nor's fon, and was fed with bread and milk by the good- 
wife of the houic, from whom the man, who now lives 
there, and is proprietor of the ftone, is lineally defcended, 
and here his forebeers (anceftors) have lived ever fince, in 
nearly the fame ftation and circumftances, for about 500 
years.

<p>Situation, &amp;c. 

r I ^HIS parifh is fituated on the weftern boundaries of the 
* pariihes of Galk and Trinity- Gafk, and on the eall- 

ern of Crieff. It has Fowils on the north, and part of Tri- 
nity-Gafk on the fouth. — The climate is confiderably wet 
and cold. The low and damp lands alohgft the banks of 
the water of Pow are believed to be productive of rheuma- 
; til'ms, a difeafe of which the inhabitants of that diftritt fre- 
quently complain. 

Pow. — The only water or rivulet worth notice in the pa- 
rifh is the Pow, which, for a long way, is confined in a canal 
or cut that was dug to ftraighteii its courfe near a century 

ago. 



564 



Statiflical Account 



ago. This cut is about 24 feet in width, and 6 in depth. 
The defcent is fo very fmall, that the water appears gene- 
rally to be ftagnant. The lands adjacent are low and flat, 
which, with other circumftances, expofe them to frequent 
inundations. This would not be altogether unfavourable 
to their agricultural improvements, could thefe floodings be 
kept under controul. This, perhaps, could be eafily ac- 
complifhed by fmall embankments and fluices, or kinds of 
locks, erected in proper places, for the management of the 
water. At prefent, the damage occafionally fuftained on 
thefe lands is very confiderable. No encouragement is 
held out to the farmer to inftitute any kind of improve- 
ments upon them. Much good foil is carried away by in- 
undations, or in a great meafure ruined by ftones and gra- 
vel thrown upon it. Lime and dung, that may be applied 
for their fertilization, are fometimcs carried off, or much 
injured by the water ; and the crop, efpecially in harveft, 
is always in danger of being wholly loft. A navigable ca- 
nal through this part of the country, from Perth to Crieff, 
could be made at a fmall expence, and would be of great 
advantage to a large and populous diftricr. 

R en t. — The valued rent of the parifh is L. 3472 : 1 : 8 
Scots-, and the real rent may be about L. 1500 Sterling. 

Population.— According to Dr Webfter's account in 
1755, the number of inhabitants of Madderty amounted to 
796. At prefent, (1795), " » s no more than 6 3*» whlch 
makes a decreafe of 165. 

Agriculture.— Hufbandry here has not been carried to 
that ftate of perfeaion to which it has arrived in fome dif- 
trids of the county. A climate rather cold and wet, and a 
foilofaconfiderablyftiffclay in mod places, have contri- 
buted to retard, in this neighbourhood, the advancement 

ot

of agricultural improvements. Something, however, has 
been done in the melioration of the foil, and in the fyftem, 
of cropping. Lime and marl have been tried with fuccefs; 
and the fowing of grafles has been attended with great pro- 
fit to the hulbandman. Farms, in general, are fmall, gi- 
ving from L. 15 to L. 50 Sterling a-year. The largeft in 
the parifh pays L. 90 Sterling a year. Although almofr, 
wholly arable, yet very little of the parifh is inclofed ; a cir- 
cumftance which is attended with much inconveniency and 
lofs. More grain is produced than is neceffary for the ufe 
of the inhabitants. The common Scotch plough, with two 
horfes without a driver, is lately got into practice. Ploughs 
of Mr Small's conftru&amp;ion have alfo been introcuced. The 
land, in fome places, contains great numbers of Jitfaft 
ftones, which prove to be great obftructions to its improve- 
ment. The Rev. Mr Ramfay, the prefent incumbent, who 
occupies a piece of land full of thefe ftones, conftrufted a 
machine for the purpofe of raifing them. It operates on 
the principles of the pully and cylinder, or wheel and axis, 
and has a power as 1 to 24. It is extremely fimple, being 
a triangle, to two fides of which the cylinder is fixed. It 
can be eafily wrought and carried from place to place by 
three men. A low four-wheeled machine, of a ftrong con- 
ftru&amp;ion, is made to go under the arms of the triangle, to 
receive the ftone when raifed up. This machine has been 
already of great ufe in clearing feveral fields of large ftones 
in this place and neighbourhood. 

Abbey of Inch-effray. — This religions houfe was founded

Countei's Matilda. It was dedicated to the honour of God,

been an ifland furrounded by the water of the Pow. In 
Latin it is denominated Infula Mijfarum, which is faid to 
be a literal tranflation of its common name, Inch-effray, for 
Inch-peffray, the Ifland of Maffes, or the ifland where mafs 
is faid. It was endowed with many privileges and immu- 
nities by David and Alexander Kings of Scotland. The 
edifices of this Abbey, which were once extenfive, are now 
in ruins, and have, on feveral occafions, fupplied abund- 
ance of ftones for building houfes, and making roads in the 
neighbourhood. The few remains of this ancient Abbey, 
with 6 or 7 acres of land in the immediate vicinity, belong 
to the Earl of Kinnoul, who, in confequence of this com- 
paratively fmall poffeflion, is patron of about twelve parifhes 
that formerly were attached to the Abbey. Mauritius, 
abbot of this place, was prefent with Robert the Bruce at 
the battle of Banuockburn, and is reported to have had 
brought along with him the arm of St Fillan. This relick 
might, indeed, have given fome encouragement to the fu- 
perflitious •, but one arm of a brave Scotlman, fighting in 
earneft for the liberty of his country, had more effecl in ob- 
taining that memorable victory, than could have been pro- 
duced by the inate virtue of all the relicks of the dead that 
could have been collected. " James Drummond, a younger

Church. — The prefent church is fituated about three- 
fourths of a mile from the ruins of the Abbay. It was 
built in the year 1689, and is not in the belt ftate of repair. 
Lord Kinnoul is patron. The (Upend amounts to 9 chal- 
ders of victual, and L. 29 Sterling, including the expence of 
communion-elements. The glebe confifts of 9 acres of 
land. Manfe and offices are in good repair. Some of the 
Seceding meeting loufes in the neighbourhood draw from 
this parifh a considerable number of hearers. 

School. — The parochial fchool is under excellent manage- 
ment, and is defervedly in high repute. It is attended by 
numerous boarders from different parts of Scotland, but 
chiefly England. Mr David Malcolm, preacher of the 
Gofpel, is at prefent mailer, and teaches Englifh, Latin, 
Greek, writing, arithmetic, book- keeping, mathematics, 
land-meafuring, &amp;.c, 

Poor.-— The paupers on the parifh-roll are commonly 
about 4 or 5. They are fupported by the collections made 
on Sabbaths at the church, which amount to about 2s, 3d. 
each Sabbatli. There is alfo a fund of L. 90 Sterling, L. 29 
of which were bequeathed by two heritors, lately deceafed. 
None of the poor are permitted to beg. 

Trade/men.— The whole parifh may be called agricultu- 
ral; and the only places that may be denominated villages 
nre Bellycloine and Craigs ; but as each of them confifts of 
a few houfes only, they hardly deferve the name of villa- 
ges. Except a very fmall quantity of coarfe linen, for the 
Perth market, there is no manufacture here. The quantity 
of linen made muft be fmall indeed, when it is confidered 
that there is only feven or ei ht weavers in the parifh, and 
thefe are clnefly employed in customary work. 1 his place

is alfo fuppHed with 4 blackfmiths, 4 wrights, 2 fhoemakers, 
2 tailors, and 1 miller. 

f Price of Labour and Provi/ions.—Thek here are equally 

high with any place in the neighbourhood. A day-labour- 
er receives 1 s. 4d. and fometimes is. 6d. a-d ay during 
fummer, and a milling in winter; a ploughman's wages are 
, from L. 8 to L. 10 Sterling a-year.—The price of provifions 
the fame as in the town of Perth, and frequently confide- 
rably higher, as the belt prices are often charged for articles 
of a very inferior quality. No ale nor whilky fold public- 
ly in the parifh. Coal is the fuel moftly ufed by the inha- 
bitants. It is moftly brought from Blairingone, in the pa- 
rifli of FolTaway, at the diftance of about 24 miles. They 
are alfo had from the (hipping at Perth, at the diflance of 
12 miles, but the price is higher than at Blairingone. Far- 
mers here, and in moft of the neighbourhood, fet a higher 
value on a little money than on their own time and labour. 
This muft always be the cafe where there is no manufac- 
ture, and farming and hufbandry are not carried on with 
proper vigour. 

Roads. — The parochial roads, for there is no turnpike in 
the parifh, are extremely bad, being hardly paffable in wet 
weather. The communication on both fides the Pow is,* 
however, kept up, by means of three bridges of ffone'thrown 
acrofs that rivulet. 

Proper Names. — The names of places in this parifh are 

partly Gaelic, and partly Englifh. To the former belong 

Tillychiandie, Bellycloine, Dallarie, Ardbennie, Balgowan : 

But Redhill, Woodend, Dubhead, &amp;c. belong to the 

latter, \ 

Antiauity, 



 



of Madderty.

Antiquity* — The only remains of antiquity in the parifli 
worthy of notice, except the ruins of the Abbey already 
mentioned, is a portion of the Roman road or canfeway 
from the camp at Ardoch to Perth. It runs about a quar- 
ter of a mile through the fouthern extremity of the parifh, 
and is very entire. It is probable that it will not long con- 
tinue in that (late, if it can by any means be converted into 
a highway, or afford materials for making or repairing 
One.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2468490">MINTO</name>, 

(County of Roxburgh, Synod of Mer£e and Tiviox- 
d ale, Presbytery of Jedburgh). 

By William Burn, D.D. Minifter.</head> 



<p>Situation, &amp;V. 

THE parifli of Minto is almoft an oblong, extending 
from eaft to weft 3^ miles ; from fouth to north 2^ 
miles. It is bounded on the eaft by the parifti of Ancrum ; 
on the north, by Lilliefleaf ; on the weft, by Wilton ; on 
the fouth, by Cavers, from which it is almoft divided by 
the river Tiviot. 

Heritors. — There are three reuding heritors : The Right 
Honourable Sir Gilbert Elliot, Baronet, the patron, whofe 
eftate lies on the eaft fide, and comprehended the old parilh 
of Minto. The family of Minto, fof ages paft, have been 
fo eminent, both in the Senate and in the other departments 
of the State, that any thing I can fay might be confidered as 

mere 



of Minto. 

mere panegyric. The houfe is large and commodious, ha? 
a fouth expofure, and is fituated on the bank of a beautiful 
winding glen, extending almoft to the Tiviot, and well 
flocked with a variety of old trees., with natural and artifi- 
cial falls of water. In coming along one of the ferpentine 
walks on the fide of the glen, the ear is all at once furprir 
fed with the unexpected noife of the largeft of thefe falls, 
the view being intercepted by a thicket ; on advancing j» 
little forward, the fall, the bridge, the large meet of water, 
the furrounding banks, interfperfed with variegated trees 
and ftirubs, and the houfe, gradually open to the eye, excite 
the moft pleafing emotions, and form one of the moft beau- 
tiful landfcapes that can be figured : The refleftion of this 
landfcape in the water adds to the grandeur of the fcene. 
The pleafure-ground is extenfive, and laid out with great 
tafte, A little to the eaft are Minto Rocks, interfperfed 
with cjumps of planting, which form an awful and piau- 
refque object From the top of thefe rocks there is a beau- 
tiful and extenfive profpeft of the different windings of the 
Tiviot, and the adjacent country, for many miles round, 
Here are the remains of a building, which, during the in- 
curfions of the borderers, feems to have been a watch-tower. 
Behind the houfe, to the north, are two hills, which rife 
with a gentle afcent to a confiderable height, and are ex- 
cellent flieep-pafture. At a fmall diftance from the houfe, 
and in the middle of a grove of trees, ftands the church 
which is neat, clean, and well feated. The village is pla- 
ced about half a mile to the weft, 3 nd contains 24 families 
moftly labourers and mechanics. Jo the fouth-weft, ari 
-^nghfh mile from the church, are the manfe and glebe. 
This was the boundary of the old parifh, Now, there are 
annexed the lands of Haflendeanbank, belonging to his 
Crace the Duke of Roxburgh, and the lands of Haffen- 
dean, the property of his Grace the Duke of Buccleugh.

Statiftical Account 



On the weft of Haffendeanbank is the eftate of Tiviotbank, 
lately purchafed by David Simpfon, Efq; another refiding 
heritor, who has built a neat modern houfe on a rifingbank, 
in view of the river, and ornamented the place with a va- 
riety of plantations. On the weft and north- weft are the 
lands of Haffendeanburn, Horfieyhill, and Huntlaw, belong- 
ing to Robert Dickfon, Efq; the fecond heritor in the pa- 
rifh, who has lately built a large convenient houfe a fmall 
diftance from the water. In this corner was the fite of 
Haffendeanburn church, fuppofed to be an appendage of 
Melrofe Abbey, (the farm next to it goes by the name of 
Monks Croft, where there was a tower called Monk3 
Tower). The church, and moft of the church-yard, are 
carried off by the water ; yet, fo ftrong is the defire " of 
" fleeping with our fathers,' that they continued to bury 
here, though, after every flood, the haughs were covered 
with human bones, till laft winter, a great fwell of the river 
fwept it all away, except one corner. Since that time, 
fome of the dead have been lifted and carried to different 
burial grounds. This parifti is now divided amongft the 
parithes of Wilton, Minto, and Roberton. The original 
ltipend was all annexed to Roberton. Here I muft offer an 
advice to landed gentlemen, always to take care that the 
ftipend be annexed together with their lands. The pro- 
prietors of this old parilh have found the disadvantage of 
not attending to this, by the different proceffes of augmen- 
tation that have been raifed againft them by the feveral 
jninifters. 

Nurfery. — On the lands of Haffendeanburn was eftablifti- 
ed, by the late Mr Dickfon's father, one of the firft nurfe- 
ries in the kingdom, which was carried on by the late Mr 
Dickfon, who alfo eftabliflied the nurfery at Hawick. Both 
thele nixrfcries are now carried on by the Mcffrs Dickfons ; 



of Minto.

and in point of extent, charafter, and circulation, are equals 
led by few, if any. They contain all kind of foreign and 
native foreft trees, fruit trees, flower-roots, and plants and 
flowering flirubs, that are naturalifed in this country ; 1e- 
fides a great collection of exotic plants. From this nurfery 
originated that carried on by Meflrs Dickfon and Company, 
Perth ; that in Edinburgh by Meflrs Dickforis and Com- 
pany. 

Soils. — The foils in the parifh are various. Towards the 
river it confifts of different kinds of loam, well adapted to 
turnips ; farther north it is a ftrong clay, and c^ay loam, 
both on a tilly bottom. 

Manure.— Some feams of marl have been difcovered, 
but fo fmall, that they do not depend on thefe, and drive 
lime and marl at a confiderable diftance and great expence. 
Lime laid down on the field, 2 s. the lime-bufhel, which is 
equal to three Winchefter bufhels. Marl, 3 s. the double 
eart. 

Acres. — The number of acres 5213; of thefe, 475 are 
planted with foreft trees. 

Implements of Hujhandry. — The Englifli plough is uni- 
verfally ufed with two horfes. Thrafhing machines are 
beginning to be ufed. 

Cultivation. — The mode of cropping or rotation, until 
within thefe few years, for a long time back, was as fol- 
lows : — The infield, divided into five breaks — 1. Fallow, 
with the dung of the farm, wheat, peafe, barley, oats, and 
then fallow again, &amp;c. : The outfield, firft folded with the 
fattle of the fa/m in general, then fown with oats for three 



574 Statijlical Account 



or four years, and even longer, if the return was a little 
more than two feeds ; after that, fallow, without any kind 
of manure; then two crops of oats, and fallow aga i n every 
th V d year, as long as it would produce a decent crop; then 
allowed to go to pafture. 

The prefent mode followed in the parilh .—The light 
land firft well prepared for turnip, which are fown in drills 
neatly made up, manured with the dung of the farm, and 
lime or mell marl, fo far as they can be procured, not to 
lofe the feafon for the turnip ; part of which is eat on the 
ground with flieep, and part with cattle in the houfe. When 
eat with fheep, it is not uncommon to few wheat with 
grafs-feeds, which, in general, fucceeds well. When the 
turnip is carried off, barley with grafs-feeds feldom fails of 
a good crop ; then hay is taken, the fog, or fecond crop, 
eat on the ground with various kinds of flock ; then, in 
autumn, taken up for wheat, which is fown with one fur- 
row ; after the wheat, oats, and then turnip; ibmetimes 
they take up with oats, and then turnip ; when the land is 
naturally very good, and in high order, wheat is taken 
after the oats, then turnip : After this rotation is followed 
twice, the grafs is allowed to lie for pafture two or three 
years, then taken up as before. The land that is too heavy 
for turnip, or the clay lands, are taken up- from grafs with 
oats ; then fallow with the dung of the farm, and a full 
drefling pf fliell marl or lime (25 double carts of marl, or 
6 double carts of lime per Enghfh acre) fown with wheat ; 
then peafe, then barley with grafs-feeds, then hay, and 
jifter that three years part u red ; then cropped as before, 

Grafs-feeds, — When only one crop is taken, they fow 
12 lb. of red clover, and half a bufhel rye-grafs, to the Eng- 
. :?) acre j when to lay in pafture ? 61b. of white clover, 

5 lb. 



of MintOa g^ijj 

5 lb. of red clover, 2 lb. of rib-grafs, half a bufhel of rye- 
gral's. 

Notwithftanding the above mode of cropping, fome, of 
late years, paflure the firft crop, which they find pays well, 
and does more juftice to the land. 

Kinds of Stock, — The kinds of flock kept or bred : Sheep 
of the Cheviot breed on the outfield • on the infield, of 
improven lands, the Difh'ley or Beckwell breed have been 
tried, with advantage, for a few years. The fhort horned, 
or Teefwater cattle, prevail, and pay the breeder well. 
Number of flieep, 1680; black cattle, 380. Yet it may 
be fuppofed the parifh is able to keep a great many more ; 
but the refiding heritors are of ufe to let, from year to 
year, a confiderable number of grafs parks; and fome of 
the farmers, who follow the turnip-hufbandry, have a fluc- 
tuating flock. Number of ploughs 36. No oxen ufed at 
prefent. Befides the horfes kept for the plough, there may 
be about 46 riding and young horfes. The harveft in ge- 
neral is early. The whole parifb is inclofed with boun- 
dary fences, and by far the greateft proportion of it fubdi- 
vided with ditch and hedge, interfperfed with ftrips and 
clumps of planting, which ferve both for fhelter and orna- 
ment. 

Servants WW^.-^Servants wages have been oh the rife 
for fome years. A married man, or hind, L. 6, 10 s. a cow 
kept, a flone of meal in the week, a firlot of potatoes 
planted, a peck or half a peck of lintfeed fown, a free 
houfe with a piece of ground for a garden, a certain quan- 
tity of fuel carried ; it is underftood, at the fame time, that 
the wife or children are to affift at carrying in flacks, &amp;c. 
A man, within the houfe, from L. 6 to L.9. A woman 
fervant, within the houfe, from L. 3 to L. 4. Day-labour- 

ers #

ers, at an average, 13.3 d. per day in furnmer, and 1 s. m 
winter. Women, who work out of doors upon the farm, 
8 d. Harveft wages fluctuating. Laft harveft high. 

For fome years, I have obferved with pleafure the rapid 
progrefs of improvement within the parifli ; the happy 
change of the mode of agriculture ; the quantity of foreign 
manure, both lime and marl, carried at fuch a diftance and 
expence, and the advantages ariling from it ; the atten- 
tion paid to roads and fences, fo advantageous to the inha- 
bitants, and agreeable to travellers. 

Roads. — There are many public roads : The funds ari- 
ling from the converfion of the ftatute-money being very 
fmall, and not adequate to making and keeping the roads 
in repair, ftill the principal roads are very good, owing to 
the attention of Sir Gilbert Elliot, who, for fome years, 
has made and kept up, at his own expence, the roads lead- 
ing through his lands; whereby the funds are applied to 
other roads within the parifli. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants, 513 fouls. 
The increafe and decreafe of population cannot be afcer- 
tained with precifion, many being accuftomed to bury in 
Haffendeanburn, where no regifter has been kept. For 
fome years back it has increafed confiderably. In 1755, it 
was 396. The Eftabliflied Church is the only place of pu- 
blic worfliip within the parifli ; they attend regularly and 
decently. There are few Seceders of any denomination. 

Poor.— The number of poor, for thefe two preceding 
years, has been, at a medium, 16, and annual payments 
L. 56, raifed by a regular poor-rate, one half paid by the 
heritors, the other half by the tenants. There are L. 50 
belonging to the kirk-feffion, the intereft goes into the caft, 

or, 



ef Minto. 



S77 



#r, alongft with the collections, is diftributed by the feflion 
in inierim fupplies, in cafe of fickncfs, or any other unforc- 
fcen calamity. In 178a, when oatmeal rofe very high, 
the curators of the poor bought in a quantity, and fold it at 
a reduced price, both to the poor on lift and poor houfe- 
holders with large families. There are no begging poor 
in the parilh. The poor-rates are more than double within 
thefe ten years, notwkhftanding the liberality of the fa- 
mily of Minto, who, when on the fpot, gave a good deal 
of private charity, and a weekly proportion of broth and 
meat, which is continued in their abfence. 

Afan/e.— The manfe was removed to its prefent firuation 
in 1773, and is in good repair. The glebe confifts of 35 
Englifh acres. The ftipend upwards of L. 90. 

School.—Tht eftablimed fchoolmafter is the only teacher 
within the parilh. He has a houfe, garden, and fchool- 
houfe; falaryL, 12, including the emoluments of feffion- 
clerk, collecting the poor-rates, &amp;c. The number of fcho- 
lars, at an average, between jo and 60. In March J792, 
above 50 fcholars were feized with the mealies in two days, 
fo rapid was the infection. The fchoolhoufe was then 
fmall and confined, which moved the heritors to build one 
in an airy fituation, the moft beautiful and commodious in 
the fouth of Scotland. 

Fuel. The diftance from fuel, and other local difadvan- 
tages, have hitherto difcouraged manufactures, &amp;c, notwith- 
standing there are a number of mechanics. Weavers, 7 5

are common, viz. ftone coffins, petrifying fprings, large

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5145731">COLLINGTON</name>, 

(County of Edinburgh, Synod of Lothian and 
Tweed dale, Presbytery of Edinburgh*) 

By the Rev. Dr John Walker *.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

'TP HIS parifh is fituated in the county of Edinburgh. It is 
in the preftjytery of Edinburgh, and fynod of Lothian 
and Tweeddale. It lies Weft from Edinburgh, and reaches 
within two miles of the fubUrbs. It extends about four miles 
eafl and weft, and about five miles in a fouth and north di- 
rection. It contains above 5000 Scots acres, the grofs 
rental of which, including mills and quarries, may be near 
L. 6000 Sterling ; but, excluding thefe, and alfo woods and 
plantations, the real land-rent amounts to about L. 4125 
Sterling. The valued rent is L.4514 Scots. 

In 

This account is an abftracT: of a more extendi hiiWy of the parifh of 
Ccllington, to be publifhed feparately- 



Statijlical Account 



In the year 1635, and for a long time after, this parim 
appears to have been a wild and uncultivated track of 
country, and thinly peopled. Even fo late as the year 
1709. " contained only 318 examinable perfons. Since 
that time, however, the lands have been indent d, and fo 
much cultivated, that it is now become one of the moft 
produdive parts of the country. The number of inhabi- 
tants has of courfe been confiderably augmented, and is at 
prefent upon the increafe, from the enlargement of the 
metropolis, and the advancement of manufactures. 

The numerous miHs erected for flour and barley ; the 
mills for the manufacture of flax, paper, tobacco, and the 
wauking of cloth ; the Ikinnery manufacture ; the bleach- 
ing fields ; a flourifhing diftillery ; a manufacture of mag- 
nefia ; and the great quarries of Hailes and Redhall ; have 
brought together, of late years, into this parim, a concourfe 
of people, and a degree of opulence formerly unknown. 

Seventeen years ago, only 25 perfons were employed in 
the manufacture of paper : At prefent, 92 perfons are occu* 
pied in the parifli in that manufacture, who, with their fa- 
milies, amount to about 300 people. 

The whole parifh is now eftimated at more than three 
irents above what it was in the year 1709. 

The hill of Caerketan-craig, in this parifh, the moft 
northerly of the Pentland Hills, is 1450 feet high above 
the level of the fea ; and the hill of Capelaw, fituated to 
the weftward of it, may be about 100 feet higher. The 
Logan-houfe Hill, lying ftill further weft in the range, and 
the higheft of the Pentland Hills, was found, by geometri- 
cal menfuration, and by repeated barometrical obfervations, 
to be 1700 feet high above the level of the fea at Leith, 
which is only 60 feet lefs than one-third of a meafured 
mile. 

TV 



6f Collington. 



The arable lands of the parifli flope gradually from the 
flcirts of the hills to the level of the river •, and they are in 
different places from 250 up to 600 feet above the level of 
the fea. This occafions a great diverfity of climate in the 
Cdurfe of three or four miles, and a great difference in the 
ripening of the crops. 

Church. — The church was built in the year 1773, an ^ * 8 
4 Very decent and convenient ftructure for public worlhip. 
Though plain, and executed at a very moderate expence* 
it is rather elegant, both on the outride and infide. It has 
even ferved as a model for fome parifh churches that have 
iince been built. 

Manfe. — The manfe was built anno 1784, at an expence 
fufficiently liberal, but with very infufficient workmanlhip. 
This is the cafe with the generality of the manfes in Scot- 
land, and which renders them, in proportion to their fize, 
the moil expenfive houfes in the kingdom. Imperfectly 
executed at firft, and that ufually for want of a proper fu- 
perintendence, their frequent repairs and rebuilding come 
to be a matter of great inconvenience to the incumbents, 
and of much additional and unnecefTary expence to the 
heritors. 

Stipend.— The (Upend annd 1791 remained what it was 
in the year 1635, amounting to L. 55 : 16 : 7^ Sterling. 
Since that time there has been an augmentation granted by 
the Court of Teinds, which is not yet allocated. 

The fall of money in its value is well known to be &amp; 
great hardlhip, and efpecially of late, upon all perfons of a 
fixed income, and upon none more than upon the clergy of 
IkotlaRd* 

The 



5^ 2 Siatijlical Account 



The ftipend of Collington, as appointed in the year 1635, 
was not only a competent, but a liberal provifion for the 
miniier of this parifh at that period. It was more than 
equal to L. 2 23 : 6 : 5l V But this, far from being lingular, 
is universally the cafe with all the clergy of Scotland. 

Glebe. — The extent of the glebe is lefs than what the law- 
appoints ; but even though it were of legal fize, it could 
not be profitably occupied and cultivated by the incum- 
bent, without an opportunity of renting fo much additional 
land, as would afford fufHcient work for a man-fervant and 
two horfes. 

School. — There has always been a refpe&amp;able grammar- 
fchool kept in the parifh. It has always been well taught, 
and well attended, not only by children of the middle and 
lower ranks, but many gentlemen, who have afterwards 
proved an honour to their country, have received the ele- 
ments of their education here. 

The fchoolmafter's falary is 200 merks Scots, the higheft 
fum appointed by law, which, with very moderate fchool- 
wages, and fome fmall emoluments as feffion-clerk, forms 
the living of a worthy old incumbent. But it is altogether 
an income that could not, in the prefent times, induce any 
young man, fufficiently educated and qualified, to under- 
take the office. 

Poor. — The poor are maintained by the collections at 
the church, and other funds, under the infpe&amp;ion of the 
kirk-feffion, and partly by an annual affefiment upon the 
heritors and tenants. The inrolled poor have each a dated 
allowance monthly; befide which, incidental charities, 
Xometimes indeed the mod neceffary of any, are bellowed by 

tlic 



of Collingtoii 



583 



the felfion on other perfons in diftrefs. Thefe inrolled 
poor are 27 in number. They have from 2 s. to 4 s. a- 
month ; or from L. 1, 4 to L. 2, 8 s. annually. The col- 
lections at the church-door and other dues, belonging to 
the fefljon, amount to about L. 35, and the affeflment is 
L.30, forming together the annual fum of L. 65. Of this, 
L. 45 are required for the fupport of the poor on the roll \ 
and the remainder is bellowed in occafional charities, and 
in defraying the little neceflary expences of the church. 

Though thefe inrolled poor are the molt indigent perfons 
in the place, none of them are in fuch a ftate of poverty as 
to be reduced to beggary. There are no beggars belong- 
ing to the parilh, as it is made known to all who are ad- 
mitted upon the poors-roll, that if they happen to beg they 
forfeit their penfion. 

Rents. — This parifli contains more land of a low value 
than any other part of the country at an equal diftance from 
Edinburgh. The prefent rents, notwithstanding, are con- 
siderable ; nor could the lands, at thefe rents, be profitably 
held by perfons inferior in Ikill, or in flock, to the prefent 
poffeffors. The arable ground lets from 30 s. to two. gui- 
neas the acre ; but there are many fields in tillage, towards 
the hills, of inferior valuq. 

The rent of houfes for cottagers is ufually from 15 s. to 
40 s. a-year. The houfes which give 40 s. are well built 
and flated, but are too high priced for the income of a com- 
mon labourer. 

Crops. — The prevailing crops here are, wheat, barley, 
oats, beans, peafe, potatoes, fummer tares, clover, and rye- 
grafs. The fowing of bear is entirely given up. There is 
very little flax cultivated, and no rye. Few turnips are 
|ai)fed, and feldom any cabbages or coleworts, but in fparing

quantity. There is but little white clover fown, there 
being but little ground laid down for paHure. 

As wheat is accounted the moft profitable produce, there 
are annually about 290 acres occupied by this crop. A 
great deal of land, though naturally unfit for wheat, is, by 
the aid of the Edinburgh dung, employed in railing 'that 
grain. 

Potatoes form an important and ufeful crop, being both 
profitable in itfelf, and an excellent preparation for wheat. 
The potatoes are all raifed by the plough, and are horfe- 
hoed. The fields of them are extenfive ; the produce 00 
the acre is generally large, and the market-price at Edin- 
burgh high: though potatoes cultivated in this way are 
never equal in quality to thole raifed in lazy beds by fpade. 
culture. 

About one.fifth of all the arable grounds in the parifh is 
ufually under clover and rye-grafs. 

Price of Labour. — A married ploughman, with all his 
perquifites, has generally to the amount of 1 s. every work- 
ing day, or about L, 16 a-year. 

The hire of a plough, with a man and two horfes during 
winter, for what is called a long yoking, is 4 s. In fpring, 
when there are two yokings, the price is 3 s. each yoking, 
or 6 s. a-day. 

When this plough is hired to till by the Scots acre, the 
price is 10 s. an acre. At one yoking a-day, the plough is 
occupied upon the acre about two days and a half. 

When harrowing is hired, it cofls 2 s. an acre; but 3 s. 
when the ground is lee. 

But the manufacturer pays for labour what the hufband- 
man cannot affo-d. During the ihorteft days of laft winter, 
a common labourer, employed by manufacturers in this 
|sariih, had I s. 4 d. a-day. 

Manures* 



of Collington. 



5*5 



Manures. — There is no manure ufed in the parifh but 
what each farm affords, excepting the Edinburgh dung, on 
which the farmers chiefly depend for their cultivation and 
their crops. This is purchafed at about 10 d. or is, each, 
double horfe-cart. If the carriage, between 3 and 4 miles, 
be eftimated at 2 s. 6 d. then each cart cofts about 3 s. 6d.j 
but the coft muft be fometimes more, and may be fome- 
times lefs, according to the diftance, and other circumftan- 
ces. The carts which bring the dung from Edinburgh 
frequently carry the corn, hay, and ftraw from the farm to 
the city, which occafions an abatement of the expence. The 
quantity of dung bellowed on an acre is ufually between 
30 and 40 double carts. 

Ploughgates. — The old ploughgates in the parifh, when 
worked by 4 horfes in a plough, were 42 in nflmber. Laft 
year, the ploughgates were rated at 49 : which at 12 s. 
each, as charged for the ftatute-labour, amounted to L. 27, 
5 s. Sterling. 

Where thefe 42 four-horfe ploughs were kept, there are 
now 60 two-horfe ploughs employed. 

The 42 four-horfe ploughs had 168 horfes and 84 men. 
The 60 two-horfe ploughs have 120 horfes and 60 men. 

The two-horfe plough is one of the greateft improve- 
ments that has yet taken place in the hufbandry of Scot- 
land. It feems to have been introduced into this parifh be- 
fore the year 1770, though in the year 1771, the plough 
with 4 horfes was flill ufed in many places. 

The ufe of the fingle-horfe cart is but a late occurrence. 
It did not take place in this parifh till about the year 
1780. 

Population.— Before the middle of the laft century, this 
parifh appears to have had but few inhabitants. Their 
Vol XIX, 4 E -numbers,

numbers, however, continued rather on the increafe till the 
time of the feven years famine, that is, from the year 1695 
to the year 1702, during which period they are faid to 
have been much diminifhed. From the year 1703, the 
numbers did again increafe, till about the year 1720. At 
that time, they were again reduced by the eftablifhment of 
larger farms, and continued for many years ftationary. But 
by the increafe of the metropolis and L of manufactures, the 
parifh has again, for a confiderable time, been advancing 
in population. There are no uninhabited houfes in it. If 
any are demolifhed, it is but in order to their being rebuilt ; 
and every year there are new ones ere&amp;ed, which are im- 
mediately filled with inhabitants. 

In an information prefented to the Court of Teinds in 
the year 1709, this parifh was faid to contain 318 examin- 
able perfons. If to thefe a fourth of unexaminable perfons 
be added, the whole inhabitants amounted to 397. • From 
a record in poffeffion of the church, it appears, that about 
the year 1750, the whole inhabitants of the parifh. amount- 
ed to 782. In Dr Webfter's Report, anno 175 J, the num- 
ber is ftated at 792. 

At prefent, the number of inhabited houfes in the parifh 
is exadtly 3135 and the number of inhabitants is 1395 
nearly, which, to a trifle, allots 44- inhabitants to each 
houfe. 

If the extent of the parifh, as is computed, amounts to 
5070 acres, and the number of people is 1395, it contains 
between 3 and 4 acres for each inhabitant. This is a very 
great degree of population, compared to the extent of land ; 
efpecially as there are upwards of 1600 acres of (beep-walk, 
and other grounds, which do not occupy 40 people. But 
the greater part of the inhabitants are fupported by manu- 
factures, and by various occupations, independent of the 
foil.

Births. — It is well known that the parifh regifters in 
Scotland have feldom been kept for any length of time 
with fufficient accuracy. In this parifh, the regifter of bap- 
tifms has been continued with uncommon regularity, from 
the year 1655 to the prefent time. Many of the fe&amp;aries, 
and all the people of the Eftablifhed Church, with few ex- 
ceptions, have always regiftered the birth of their children. 
The baptifm of children, alfo, from other parifhes, has al- 
ways been pundually diftinguifhed ; fo that a more exa&amp; 
regifter of baptifms, for a period of 140 years, is feldom to 
be met with. 

From that regifter it appears j 

1. That during the above period of 140 years, there 
were 2447 males, and 2268 female children baptized, which 
fixes the number of males born, compared to that of fe- 
males, at 12 to 11 nearly. » 

2. That in fome particular years the births of one fex 
greatly exceed the other in number ; but in the following, 
or in a few fubfequent years, both fexes return to their or- 
dained proportion. Notwithftanding many temporary in- 
equalities, the balance, at laft, is preferved upon the poife. 
Yet this is but one, among a thoufand inftances, of an im- 
mediate unremitted fuperintending influence, directed by 
unlimited power and wifdom. 

3. That there are fome years in which the inhabitants 
are remarkably prolific, compared to what they are in 
others. The number of children born in one year is fome- 
tnnes nearly double that in the preceding or fubfequent 
year while the number of inhabitants muft have been near- 
iy the fame.

5- That 



588 Statijlical Account 



5- That the average number of births being 39, and the 
number of houfes or families 313, each annual birth corre- 
fponds to 8 families. 

Twins. — From the above regifter it aifo appears : 

1. That of 4715 children baptized in this pariih, 94 
were twins ; therefore, one twin-child for 51 children bap- 
tized. 

2. That during 17 years, including the feven dear years, 
there was no twin birth. In one particular year there 
were 3 fuch births, 

- 3. That in the whole period, the male twin-children 
were to the female as 40 to 54. 

4. That the number of males prevailed in thofe years in 
which male twins were born ; and that of the females in 
thofe years iii which female twins were born. 

Mar iqges.- — There has been an exact regifter of marria- 
ges kept in this parifli from the year 1655 to the prefent 
time. 

From that regifter it appears ; 

1. That during the period mentioned, there are 1395 
marriages recorded ; but reckoning only one half of thofe 
marriages, where one only of the parties was a parifhioner, 
the number would amount but to 1060. 

2. That from the year 1655 to 1794 inclufive, the bap- 
tifms were 4715, and the marriages 1060. During the 
laft ten years, the baptifms were 401, and the marriages 
91. In both cafes, the marriages were lefs than a fourth, 
but more than a fifth, compared to the number of bap- 
tifms. 

3. Thar, at prefent, there is only one marriage annually 
for 155 inhabitants.. 

Deaths. 



of Collingtoju 5 8$ 

Deaths. —The regifter of burials in this parifh has been 
very carefully kept fince the year 1728 ; diftinguifhing the 
death of children and of adults, of ftrangers and of pa- 
rilhioners. 

From the above regifter of burials for 49 years it ap- 
pears. 

1. That the burials were 944 ; during the laft 10 years, 
175. In the former period the births had been 1696: in 
the latter, 394. In both cafes, the births compared to the 
deaths approach to the proportion of 2 to 1, forming a very 
flriking account of the increafe of the people in this part 
of the country. * 

2. That the number of ftrangers from other parifiies 
buried here amounts, at an average, to 6 perfons annually, 
which is confiderably more than the number of parimioners 
buried in other places. 

3. That of the 944 perfons buried, 452, or nearly one 
half, were children under 14 years of age. 

4. That there are about 20 deaths annually ; and above 
60, perhaps 69, inhabitants for each annual death. 

5. That in this, as jn all other registers of deaths, there 
are years moft remarkable for their health, and others for 
their mortality. In fome cafes, the caufes of this great 
difference are to be obferved, but in others they cannot be 
difcerned. 

6. That near 70 years ago, and even about 50 and 40 
years ago, the number of deaths was greater than at pre- 
ient, though the number of people was certainly lefs. The 
lower ranks, which form the body of the people, are now 
lodged, clothed, and fed, in a manner more friendly to 
health than in thefe former times. 

Difeafes.—Thtte are no local diftempers, nor any pecu- 
liar appearance in any difeafe, obfervable in this pariih.

The air is falubrious, and the foil in general dry, without 
any ground fogs or ftagnating water. 

Ri ver .-—On the river of Collington, which rifes on the 
north fide of the Pentland Hills, and after a coiirfe of about 
16 miles, runs into the fea at Leith, there is much of that 
romantic fcenery for which the fmall rivers in Scotland are 
remarkable ; where they run in deep narrow glens, amidft 
great variety of ground with rocks and hanging woods, ac- 
companied with fmall level fields or haughs, fertile in corn 
and grafs. This fmall river does more work than perhaps 
any other, even of the largeft fize in Scotland. In a courfe

Agriculture. — The husbandry here is entirely regulated 
by the fupply of dung which is brought from the city of 
Edinburgh. This local advantage leads to a peculiar me- 
thod of farming ; proper, indeed, for fuch a fituation, though 
inapplicable to the country in general. 



Cattle. — The number of work-horfes in the parilh is about 
171 •, of faddle horfes, 31; and of carriage-horfes, 10 ; in 

all,

that of the fheep about 4000. 

There are not above half a dozen breeding fwine in the 
parifh. 

Bees. — There are about 35 winter hives of bees in the 
parifh, and formerly they were much more numerous. 

Antiquities.— -Of the names of places in this parifh, there 
occurs but one evidently derived from the Gaelic ; the reft, 
like that of the parifh, are almoft all of Britifh or Saxoa 
origin. On the lands of Comifton there are ftill the vefti- 
ges of a very large and ancient encampment. Adjacent to 
this camp, and near the houfe of Fairmilehead, an extenfive 
and important battle had been fought, and two very large 
conical cairns erected, on demolifhing which, for the pur- 
pofe of making the turnpike-road, remains of human bones 
were' found in them, and feveral fragments of old arms, two 
of which are ftill in the pofTeffion of Mr Trotter of Morton- 
hall, the proprietor of the ground. Not far from thefe 
cairns there had likewife been eredted an upright pillar 
(tone, which ftill remains. It is a rude mafly block of 
whinftone, of a flat fhape, 7 feet high above the furface of 
the ground, and above 4 feet below it. It is called the Kel 
Stane, an old Britifh word lignifying the Battle Stone. It 
has alfo pafled immemorially by the name of Camus Stone, 
which would feem to intimate its connection with fome 
Danifh commander.

NUMBER XXVIII. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010316">INNERLEITHEN</name>, 

(County of Tweeddale or Peebles, Synod of Lo- 
xhian and Tweeddale, Presbytery of Peebles.) 



By the Rev. John Walker, Minijler qfTraquair.</head> 


<p>
Name. 

HPHE water of Leithen, which falls into Tweed near the 
middle of the parifh, gives name to the whole, and 
pours nearly all the water of its extenfive furface into this 
noble river. This is the laft great acceffion Tweed receive* 
before it leaves the diftri£t to which it gives name. The 
old parifli of Innerleithen received, as an addition, all that 
part of the fupprefled parifli of Kailzie which lay north of 
the Tweed. 

The parifh bears a nearer refemblance to an equilateral 
triangle than any other regular figure ; each fide of which 
amounts to about 94- miles. The courfe of the Tweed,

the boundary of Stow on the eaft, forming the fouthern 
fide ; and from Tweed-bank at Spittlehope Burn-foot to 
Blakehope Scarr, the north-weft; and thence to Tweed- 
bank, below Thornylee, the north-eaft. It contains, accor- 
ding to Armftrong, who made a map of the county about 
20 years ago, 22,270 acres, Scots meafure. What propor- 
tion the arable land may bear to the whole furface is not 
ealily determined. The land in tillage, communibus anms, 
is confiderably under 1000 acres, of all kinds of crops. The 
general appearance of the parifti is broken, rugged, and 
precipitous, riling from the brink of Tweed, and the courfe 
of the Leithen, to near 1000 feet, without, in fome places, 
leaving fpace fufficient for the breadth of a road, unlets af- 
fifted by art, which has been but fparingly bellowed to 
that purpofe. Though, to a ftranger paffing along the 
highway from Peebles to Kelfo, nothing feems to ftrike his 
eye but ftones or rock, yet there the indefatigable ftieep 
find a variety of fucculent plants, of which the apparent 
more abundant pafture of the northern expofure feems to 
be deprived. The parifti gradually rifes from Tweed to 
its northern point, where it meets with the contiguous pa- 
rifties of Eddlefton and Temple, which bound it on the 
north ; Eddlefton and Peebles on the weft ; Heriot and 
Stow on the north-eaft. Tweed forms the fouthern boun- 
dary, and feparates Innerleithen from Traquair. Windle- 
ftraw Law is the higheft ground in the parifti, and is in the di- 
rection of the north-eaft fide. Near this mountain, the coun- 
ties of Edinburgh, Peebles, and Selkirk meet. The whole 
expofure of the parifti being chiefly fouthward, is productive 
of fine grafs. The ftieep-walks, though high and elevated, 
are, from this circumftance, much valued by the farmer as 
fure fpring ground ; at which feafon, from the inconftancy 
and feverity of the weather, the animal, already reduced,

hy the winter ftorms. fuffers mod. From the fame caufe, 
an early vegetation arifes, which is denied to the northern 
expofure, and, from its fucculence, furnifhes fuHenange t* 
the dam to fupport her tender brood. 

Soil, i$c. — In the courfe of ages, the decompofing power 
of the atmofphere, and the decay of vegetable fubftances, 
have formed the greater part of the foil. The common 
whinftone, and other fchiftic rocks, have formed the bafis 
of the greater part of the fuperftratum, which contains a 
confiderable proportion of clay, as may be fuppofed. be- 
caufe formed from that clafs of rocks. The fubfidence 
from the Tweed and Leithen has formed the leaft, but moft 
fertile foil. This being fubjedt to inundation, is not fo fully 
under the power of the farmer as the hanging plains above 
either. In thefe, fprings burfting through the fiflures of 
the rocks, known by the name of blind fprings, and large 
ftones fixed in the earth, were unfurmountable difficulties 
to the inexperienced farmer of former times : now, 
though agriculture is here only in its infancy, the active 
and intelligent know how to overcome both, with prodi- 
gious advantage to themfelves. 

Climate, Difeafes, ifc. — The climate, in fuch an exten- 
five hilly diftridl, mull be various ; the air, however, is 
dry and healthy. The banks of the Tweed have an early 
harvelt, both from the Iharpnels of the foil, and the genial 
expofure. The loweft part of the parifli was fubjedl: to an 
annual vifit of the ague about 20 years ago ; but whether 
from the drainage of the land, or from the better agricul- 
ture of that particular part of the parifh, it has for fomc 
time paft entirely difappeared. No epidemical difeafe af- 
flicts the inhabitants at prefent. Rheumatifm, caufed by

the lower clafs as they advance in life. A houfe for the 
accommodation of this ufeful order of men. is, for the moft 
part, conftru&amp;ed of ftone and feal, is reared on a fudden, 
- and the occupant inhabits it as foon as conftru&amp;ed. Ill fe- 
cured from the effects of the weather, and fcantily provided 
with fuel, which is both dear and fcaree, the feeds of this 
difeafe are rooted into the conftitution, which the vigour of 
youth may for a while brave ; but, as old age advances, fel- 
dom fail to manifeft themfelves in great virulence, and im- 
pair the ftrength of manhood by immature old age. Inno- 
culation for the fmall-pox gains ground, from experience of 
its ufefulncfs, though contrary to the theory of religious 
prejudice. 

Fijh, \3c — Affociations have been formed to preferve 
the falmon in Tweed during clofe-time, which can produce 
no good, fo long as falmon are not permitted to come up 
beyond a certain length before this feafon commences. The 
intereft: of no clafs of men here is concerned in their pre- 
fervation. To make it fo, the proprietors below muft yield 
up a few of their good fifh, to give the people above them 
an experimental proof of the difference betwixt good and 
bad falmon. The Want of this makes them unable to di- 
ftinguifh the good from the bad ; and all is fifh that comes 
in the net. The firft ftreams in Tweed in which the fal- 
mon depofit their fpawn are within a few miles of the 
bounds of this parilh. The people here can judge, by the 
appearance of the file, whether it will depofit its^fpawn in 
Tweed or its feeders. Tweed formerly produced a great 
quantity of falmon ; now they are feldom to be caught ex- 
cept after clofe-time. Trout are to be met with in great 
quantity both in Tweed and Leithen. Pike are found in 
the old run of the Leithen. Birds are of the fame kinds 
all over the county. Quadrupeds the fame alfo. 

Mineral 



59^ Statijlical Account 



Mineral Spring. — The water which iffues out of this 
fpring is of the fame nature with that of Harrowgate. 'In 
many disorders it has been productive of much relief to 
the afflicted. To fill this account of cures performed, or 
to lengthen it by giving an imperfect analyfis of its water, 
■would be improper. Two ftrong facts, which have come 
to hand, and are well attefted, of its fanative effects, ought 
not to be paffed over. They both relate to cafes of infla- 
mation in the eyes. The firft is of a girl of 10 years of 
age, almoft blind, from the neighbourhood of Hawick, who, 
by continuing to ufe the*mineral for about a month, for two 
feafons, returned home the laft feafon perfectly recovered. 
The other is of a young .woman from Galafhiels, with a 
fimilar complaint, who, by flaying five weeks, returned 
home with the full ufe of her eyes. The firft could dif- 
cern nothing diftindtly when {he came the firft feafon. The 
laft could not dittinguifti any object at the diftance of 50 
yards. Thefe cures, with many others, can be very well 
attefted. In all diforders of the blood, its effects are highly 
beneficial, particularly in cutaneous eruptions. The want of 
accommodation prevents a greater concourfe of people from 
being benefited by this falutary fpring. So far as that is 
afforded, it is at one feafon of the year fully occupied. The 
fhort diftance from Edinburgh ftiould make it a defirable 
watering place. 

Population.— -The number of fouls in the parifli amounts

Of thefe, 388 inhabit the village of Innerleithen, and 222 
the reft of the parifti. Population in 1755, by Dr Web- 
fter's account, was 559. 

It may not be improper to remark, that the whole of 
this extenfive parifh is in the hands of fourteen occupants ; 
and that of thefe, two only are fulfilling the firft command- 
ment with promife. Such are the hopes of the rifing ge- 
neration, amid the wane of men by the ravages of lawlefs 
ambition. Where the cottager meets with a mafter who 
gives him a cow's grafs, he finds himfelf able to raife com- 
fortably a family for the ufe of his country. Their wants 
are few, and eafily fatisfied with milk and potatoes. To 
the credit of many of the farmers here, they affift in rear- 
ing, by thefe accommodations, a race of ufeful labourers 
for the fucceeding generation. Though the farmers in ge- 
neral feem to have an averfion at matrimony, it muft be 
mentioned to their credit, that they liberally affift thofe 
under them who do fo. The greateft number of the inha- 
bitants are employed in agriculture^ and the care of their

that can be excepted ; and thefe no more than what the fan

manufacture What mult have occurred to every one 
fince the value of manufactures were known in this coun 
try, was left to be accomplifhed by Alexander Brodie Efq- 
of Carey- ftreet, London. Some few years ago he erected 
a large workhoufe, at confutable expence, from the patrio- 
tic purpofe of promoting a fpirit of induftry in the vicinity 
of the place which gave him birth. Upwards of L. 3000 
Sterling were expended on the works and machinery, 
which is of the belt conftrudion ; but from caufes which the 
author does not choofe to dwell on, the manufacture has 
not gone on with that fuccefs, to the advantage of the gen- 
tleman who erected it, that its firft beginning promifed. 
The fault neither lay with him nor the conductor of the 
work. Such as it is, it returns, on the whole, very well. 
An infant manufadure, in a country truly paftoral, has many 
difadvantages. The whole operations of teazing and card- 
ing are performed by water. The houfe confifts of five 
floors ; the firft and fecond of which are occupied by the 
operations performed by water, and which, had circum-

by the piece. The dyers have a fixed weekly rate, which, 
differs according to their qualifications. In the courfe of 
the firft year after the work was begun, cloth was manu- 
factured to the amount of L. 1200 Sterling, and has gradu- 
ally increafed. 

The whole of MrBrodie's attention as a ufeful member of 
fociety is by no means dire&amp;ed to this one objecl:. His ex- 
tenllve operations in Shropfhire and London are too gene- 
rally known to need particular mention. To promote a 
fpirit of induftry in this diftria, he engaged in this manu- 
facture, and gave the direction of it to his nephew, who, 
though not at firft acquainted with the trade in wool, by 
application, fodn made himfelf mafter of the bufinefs. 

Sheep, Horfes, and Cattle. — Upwards of 15,000 fiieep are 
kept, in general of the black-faced kind, as a breeding 
ftock. There are 90 horfes, and about 200 head of black 
cattle. Few of the ftoremafters have thought of changing 
their ftock of ewes and rams entirely, but they have of late 
purchafed fome of each, particularly the rams, fince the 
price of wool has increafed fo confiderably. 

The fheep paftures and arable grounds are occupied by 
the fame perfon, as is the cafe over all this diftria. It is 
not how many acres of arable, but how many fcore of ftieep 
does the farm hold, which fixes the rent. 

Stipend, Church.— -The ftipendis, communibus annis, about 
L. 1 10. The Duke of Queenfberry is patron. The glebe 
contains, for the fite of manfe and garden ground, and crop 
and pafture, about 10 acres and a half. It has been afked, 
What proportion of ground ought a minifter to poffefs as

minifter o£ Innerleithen have a profitable occupancy ? No. 
The land he poflefles will not enable him to employ his 
man and horfes half the time they ought to be employed. 
Ground cannot be laboured without two horfes. Two he 
muft keep, for the hiring of his ploughing he cannot obtain. 
One horfe he ought to keep for parifh duty ; and when this 
requires one horfe, the other is thrown idle as to the tilling 
the ground, and many other farming purpofes. Should he, 
Apoftle like, abjure the ufe of horfes for his own accom- 
modation, he may then drive in his fuel, and have his 
little farm cultivated in proper feafon ; but every year he 
muft go to market for fodder to maintain his horfes ; and 
this the late incumbent confidered as an average expenoe 
of L. 5 per annum ; which, added to the wages and mainte- 
nance of a ploughman, renders the glebe a lofs rather than 
profit to any incumbent. Without a cow, no family can 
be comfortable in the country ; the glebe, as yielding this 
benefit, is, with all its pecuniary difadvantages, highly ufe- 
ful. Could the minifter of Innerleithen find people to hire, 
for driving his coals and tilling his land, and be, by thefe 
means, under no necefllty of keeping a man-fervant and a 
pair of horfes, he might then not be under any difficulty of 
providing fodder for two cows, and a horfe for parifh, duty, 
and by that means his glebe would turn out profitable. 
As circumftances ftand, this cannot be obtained. Accom- 
modation, therefore, and not profit, is all that can be looked 
for. Twenty acres of farm, at a reafonable rent, would 
render the clergyman's fituation comfortable, and the pof- 
fefiion of the glebe profitable. Such is the outline of an 
anfwer to the queftion, as it relates to this parifh. The 
writer of this report fpeaks not from theoretical fpeculation, 
but from dear bought experience ; and what is true in the 
one cafe is fully applicable in the other. Both manfe and 
church are in a good ftate of repair. The manfe was built

for the laft incumbent ; the church a few years ago, and, for 
its lize, is one of the neateft country churches in the county. 

The poor are fupported by a poors-rate, one half paid 
by the heritors, the other by the tenants. The rate has aa 
additional increafe every year, which is a general obferva- 
tion made from every parilh where this mode of provifion 
has been recurred unto. The feffion have fome funds in 
their hands, which they diftribute to the mod indigent of 
ihofe who receive the legal provifion, in cafes of particular 
diftrefs. The late incumbent obtained from the Earl of 
Traquair, when he fitted up the mineral well, the right of 
difpofing of it, feafon by feafon, to fome pauper, who, by- 
opening and lhutting it to thofe who reforted to it, might 
be entitled to any pecuniary gratuity they pleafed to confer. 
By the regulations, it was to be open two hours every 
morning, and two every evening, Sunday evening excepted. 
Mr Brodie, whofe generofity is only equalled by his im- 
partiality, gives L. 5, 5 s. every year, to be diftributed by 
the clergyman to poor houfeholders. , As foon as this gen- 
tleman had a permanent intereft in the parifh, he began to 
feel for the wants of the indigent, and though not obliued 
by law to provide for the poor, he made a law for himfelf, 
by which he has contributed mdre to the needy, than the 
moft extenfive proprietor is bound to by law. This, with 
the circulation of money produced by thofe employed in 
the manufadory, many of whom are old people and chil- 
dren, who could have earned little or nothing, has- benefited 
the poor of the village very much. 

Morals.— Whether the eafier acquifnion of money has'

that branch of it, fobriety, have long been at odds in this 
diftricl. Example goes beyond precept. The lower clafs 
will, if poffible, imitate their betters. What proportion 
the Diflenters may bear to thofe who are of the Eftablifhed 
Church is beyond the power of man to determine. The 
various denominations among us ufe times of vacancy, if 
poffible, to carry off as many as they can ; and difguft, or 
difappointment, or any thing, in fhort, may, with a little 
fophiftry, become the pretext. Thefe caufes have already 
begun to operate, and what effects they fliall produce time 
alone can unfold. 

School. — The average number of fcholars may be betwixt 
30 and 35. The greateft number are in fpring. The 
fchoolmafter teaches Latin, Englifh, writing, and arithmetic. 
His emoluments of office are L. 100 Scots. 

Mr Brodie, who equally regards, in his extenfive philan- 
thropy, the fuftenance of the body and the improvement of 
the mind, gives him L. 5, 5 s. for educating poor children. 
His office of feffion-clerk may yield L. 1. He has likewife 
a free houfe and garden. His whole emoluments can hard- 
ly exceed L. 20 per annum. He has contrived to rear a 
family upon this flender income. If emolument of office is 
neceffary to promote its ufefulnefs, this moft important of 
all employments for the good of fociety, a country fchool- 
mafter, will foon be no more, unlefe fome means are fallen 
upon to render it more lucrative and refpe&amp;able. 

Antiquities. — Tower houfes are met with in a ruinous 
condition at the mouth of every defile through this exten- 
five parifti. Tradition is filent, except in two or three in- 
flances at moft, by whom they were occupied. If the fame 
fcenes of iniquity were praclifed in them all that the records 
of the prefby tery of Peebles attaches to one of them, they

fortification was erefted, in times of hoftility, on a nfing 
ground immediately adjoining to the village of Innerleithen. 
Vertices of the folium are ftiU difcernible on the outride of 
the third line of circumvallation. Within the third of thefe 
lines there is a fpace of rather more than an Englifh acre. 
An immenfe quantity of ftones have been colleded to form 
thefe lines. No cement feems to have been employed. 
The loofe ftones were, however, built with confiderable 
care. By whom conftruaed, at what time, againft whom, 
are queries to be anfwered by conjecture only. 

Names of Places.— Thefe are, in general, borrowed from 
the dialed of the language at prefent fpoken; fome from 
their prefent or former proprietors. Horlbrugh Caftle, 
Tower, and lands, derived their name from the anceftors of 
Horfbrughof that ilk, a confiderable proprietor at prefent 
in the parifli. The origin of the name the writer learned, 
in the courfe of this inveftigation, to have arifen from the 
following circumftance During the time that Peebles was 
a hunting refidence to the Kings of Scotland, the King and 
his nobles were engaged in the fport of hawking. The 
hawk flew acrofs the Tweed after his prey. The river 
happened to be in flood ; the King and the nobles could 
not follow. The anceftor of the family, of the name of 
either Hunter or Hamilton, was, at the time, ploughing on 
the lands, which afterwards, by royal grant, became his 
own •, acquainted with the river, whofe banks he cultivated, 
he loofed his plough, and with one of his horfes came acrofe 
the ftream, and reftored the hawk and his prey to the royal 
hunter •, for which meritorious fervice the King endowed 
him with all the lands within view of his plough north of 
Tweed. As he was crofiing the river, either the King, or 
»ne of his attendants, cried out, Horfe bruik weet t and thence 

the

the lands, and their owner, were called Horfebruik ; which 
in the courfe of time, have been changed into Horfburgh. 
rakat quod valtre p 0 JjU~-Tht vxt kat proprietor has, in- 
dependent of royal grant, a very juft title to the lank on 
which he refides. They came into the family by an in- 
termarriage with the name of Tait ; but the prefent occu- 
pant, by judicious improvement, has raifed their value, 
from fcarcely L. 50 of annual income, to be worth L. 300' 
per annum, The only fubftantial improvement in planting 
and inclohng, in the whole parifh, has been effected by him 5 
and whilft he has given beauty to his vicinity, he has added 
confiderably to his annual income. In a country like ours, 
•where fo much ftill remains to be done, every attempt to 
improve the face of the country merits its due praife, and 
ought not to be withheld. 

Road up leithen, — In fnmmer 1794, this road, formed 
by fubfcription, and at prefent kept in repair by the fame 
means, with the addition of the money for the commuta- 
tion fpr ftatute labour, was begun to be ufed for the pnr- 
pofes of driving lime and coal. During the courfe of that 
iummer upwards of 3000 bolls of lime, Linlithgow mea- 
sure, and a confiderable quantity of coal, were drove on it. 
This line of communications fhortens the diftance from coal 
and lime, from 12 to 14 miles. Both coul and Hme are of 
better quality, and a confiderable laving in toll-bar duty 
js obtained. The effects of opening this communication 
Jiave already appeared highly beneficial to thole who at 
firft fubfcribed, and they are, as far as they are individually 
concerned, ready to enter iuto a fecond fubfcription, to 
parry the meafure, as far as their ability allows, into com- 
plete effect. Thp narrow policy of others, who have not 
fubfcribed, and who have taken advantage of this communi- 
cator., prevents them from fubfcribing at all. A public good

may by thefe means fall to nought, and the improvement of 
this highly improvable diftricl: be retarded. The accom- 
plilhing this purpofe is worthy the patriotic fpirit of the 
Honourable Prefident of the Board of Agriculture. In his 
extenfive communications with the members of that Ho- 
nourable Board, he may open the eyes of fome of them to 
their own advantage, and may point out to the nation in 
general the propriety of adopting this line of intercourfe 
betwixt Carlifle and Edinburgh. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — In the account already 
given, the advantages of this parifh have already been 
pretty fully detailed. A pure air, a fertile foil, abundant 
paftures, the means of inftruftion afforded to all, even the 
indigent, plenty of labour for the induftrious, a legal provi- 
fion provided for the needy, are a fhort recapitulation of 
thefe. The difad vantages are, in fome refpe&amp;s, like wife 
hinted at. The greateft of thefe is, the diftance from fuel. 
Peats are not to be obtained for general ufe. Furze was 
formerly the dependence of the lower clafs for their win- 
ter fire ; but the induftry of a farmer, who began his occu- 
pancy at Whitfunday laft, has already gone far to remove 
this fupply, and will foon make an abfolute fcarcity. The 
lands he poffeffes were formerly rented at L. 84 Sterling 
yearly; now they are let in leafe for 19 years at L. 350 
Sterling per ann. During the currency of the former leafe, 
the lands might be fuffered to bear furze, and yet the rent 
might have been paid. As things now fiand, he rauft try 
fome more productive mode of occupancy, elfe the price of 
labour and rent cannot be paid ; the laft of which is qua- 
druple what it was, and the firft double, in the courfe of 
thefe laft fix years. The completing the road up Leithen 
would bring the village of Innerleithen into a certainty of 
having coals at all feafons of the year. An attention to 

fobriety

fobriety would furnim them with the means of providing 
themfelves with fuel of the beft and cheapeft kind. Com- 
fortable at home, they would not need to feek enjoyment 
abroad. Contented with their condition, they would not 
follow thofe given to change. Thefe reflections by no 
means are intended for general application. Under all the 
difadvantages already enumerated, the generality enjoy, in 
a confiderable degree, the advantages of civiUfed fociety. 
They love their country, are attached to its conftitution, 
and rejoice in the fecurity the laws afford. If any thing is 
awanting to meliorate their condition, it is reducing their 
religious knowledge to practice. 

Real and Valued Rent.— As far as can be conjeaured, the 
real rent is upwards of L. 3000 Sterling : The valued rent 
is L. 6639 : 1 ; *•

Alford). 

From Materials communicated by the Rev. William 

Sfence.</head> 



<p>THE parifh of Glenbucket is fituated in t'ne prefbytery 
of Alford, and fynod and county of Aberdeen. The 
•xtreme breadth, (at leaft of the cultivated part) is not 
above a mile, generally not half a mile •, its length about 
four. It lies on each fide of a fmall brook, called Bucket, 
running from north-eaft to fouth-weft, where it falls into 
Don, and is bounded by the parifh of Strathdon on the 
eaft, fouth, and weft. The parifh of Cabrach lies to the 
morth, from which it is feparated by a hill of about four 
miles wide. Tradition reports that it once belonged to 
that parilh ; and the remains of the chapel, where it is 
likely public worfhip was performed, were not long ago to 
be feen. The foil is, for the moft part, of a light loam, on 
fome farms mixed with clay. . The fprings are in general 
backward, and vegetation advances very flowly at firft : 
The fummers are, however, warm, as the parifh is encircled 
by hills, fo that the har veils are by no means fo late as 
might be expected. The crops are, oats, for the moft part 
of an early kind, and Scotch bear. Artificial grafles are

beginning, and only beginning, to be fown, and the advan- 
tages of them to be known. As there are, however, hardly 
any inclofures, and every farmer, almoft every cottager, 
keeps fome fheep, they are with difficulty guarded in the 
winter. The turnips muft indeed, in general, be taken up, 
as there is no preferving of them. 

The people are fober, and very induftrious. There are 
few that do not make their own ploughs and carts, and alfo 
their brogues or Ihoes. 

The parifh is the property of one heritor, (the Earl of 
Fife) ; and contains, by a very exaft lift taken laft winter, 
( x 795)» 449 fouls i 219 males, 220 females. The average 
of deaths, for eight years, is about 8. The population, ac- 
cording to Dr Webfler's account, in 1755, was 430. 

The names of places, almoft without exception, are de- 
rived from the Gaelic, as Badmyon, which gives name to 
an excellent fong ; and means, as is faid, the Bird's Bvjh, or 
Thicket. 

There are no funds for the fupport of the poor but the 
weekly collections, which are fmall. Luckily there are 
feldom any that require conftant fupply. Six or feven re 
ceive a few (hillings twice or thrice in the year. 

As the parilh is fmall, fo the ftipend is perhaps the 
frhalleft in Scotland. The kirk, manfe* and offices, were all 
lately rebuilt. 

The parifti lies at a great diftance from every market- 
town. Aberdeen, the poft-town, is above 30 miles off. 
To it the people muft carry whatever they have for fale, 
and from thence all their neceffaries are procured. None 
but thofe who have felt it can imagine how inconvenient 
it is to be at fuch a diftance from a poft-office and market" 
town, when, for fix or eight weeks, fometimes all communi- 
cation is flopped.

<p>Extent. 

r J n HE parifli of Yetholm, or Zetholm, has never had any 
other name, as far as is known, nor does it appear that 
a part of any other pariik has been annexed to it. Where 
longeft, which is nearly from north-weft to fouth-eaft, its 
extent is between four miles and four and a half; the 
breadth generally about two miles ; and the Bowmont wa- 
ter divides it into two parts, not quite equal, the largeft be- 
ing towards the north-weft. On the fouth, and fouth-weft, 
and weft, it is bounded by the pariQi of Morbottle ; on the 
north-weft by the parifh of Linton ; and on all the other 
Vol. XIX, 4 H quarters

quarters by the EhgliAi border. It is hilly, but the hills are 
green. The Bowmont water has fome pretty large haughs; 
and from the minifter's roanfe to the north-weft there is a 
piece of flat land along with thefe haughs, for the extent of 
about i£ mile.— About ftraight weft, where this parifh 
marches with that of Morbottle, there is a loch of more 
than a mile in circumference, in which are both pike and 
perch, the flat land already fpoken of reaching round Ye- 
tholm kaw till you come quite to the loch. 

Agriculture. — About 1170 Englifli acres are actually un- 
der tillage, and the ugh there be fome wheat fown, yet the 
greateft part is laid out in railing barley and oats, and tur- 
nips. Even the fmall tenants, who have from 1 and a to 
10 and 15 acres, from Mr Wauchope and the Marquis of 
Tweeddale, have their turnip quarter, for which, on ac- 
count of their vicinity to Northumberland, they find a rea- 
dy market, getting, when a good crop, fome years L. 3, 
others L. 5, to be eaten upon the ground with flieep. Much 
more land could be made arable, 

The flieep maintained in fummer (not reckoning the 
lambs, which are about 2500, and of which 1160 are fold 
off whilft lambs) are about 480©. They are generally the 
largeft of the Cheviot breed, and if a period of 10 years is 
taken, it will be found upon an average, that the beft prices 
in this country have been got for wool growing in this pa- 
rifti. Laft fummer moft of it was fold for L, I, 11 s. per 
ftone. It is the fliort clothing-wool, and they prefer the 
New England tar, mixed with butter, for falve. In ma- 
king the falve for fmearing, they take 40 pounds of butter, 
24 ounces in the pound, to 6 Scots pints of tar, with which 
they fmear 140 flieep. A good many years ago, a trial 
was made in a neighbouring parifh, farther up the Bow- 
mont water, of crofling with the Bakewell breed ; but it

Was found fo far from being an improvement, that they fold 
them off as fpeedily as pofiible. 

The number of black cattle, except cows for milk, are 
comparatively fmall. The number of farmers horfes, both 
for work and riding, is 39 , and of farmers and hinds or 
herds cows, is 50. For fome time paft only 12 oxen have 
been reared ; 40 Highland cattle have been bought in and 
fed off. Among the fmall tenants, and inhabitants who 
have no land at all, are kept 76 horfes. The number of 
their milk cows may be about 64, befides fome of them 
bringing up young ones. 

Common. — There is a common in this parilh of about 
ioo acres in extent, of which 40 or 50 are thought im- 
proveable. There is very little wood, and the gentlemen 
feem not difpofed to plant any, although there is abundance 
of land fit for no other ufe. 

Population. — This parilh has, I fuppofe, more than dou- 
bled its population in the courfe of this century, becaufe 
many villages in the neighbouring parifhes of Hounam, 
Morbottle, and Linton, have been totally razed lince the 
memory of people now living, and many of the inhabitants 
have withdrawn into the towns of Yetholm and Kirk- 
Yetholm, two villages in which the greateft number of this 
parilh dwell ; the former belonging to Mr Wauchope, and 
fituated upon the north-weft fide of the Bowmont water; 
the other belonging to the Marquis of Tweeddale,and on the 
fouth-eaft fide of faid Water. 

When the prefent incumbent was ordained in the year 
1786, he, in the courfe of his parochial vifitation, found the 
number of fouls to be in Town- Yetholm 539, in Kirk- 
Yetholm 323, and in the reft of the parilh 208, making in 
all 1070 fouls. There were 491 males, and 579 females. 

Upon

Statiflical Account 



Upon taking a new furvey of the number of inhabitants, 
reckoning none but thofe who relide at prefent (January 
1797) in the parifh, I found in Town-Yetholm 490 fouls, 
in Kirk-Yetholm 305, and in the reft of the parifh 181 ; 
in all 976. The population in 1755, by the return fent to 
Dr Webfter, was 699. 

The reafon why the number of females exceeds that of 
the males muft be, that for about 30 or 40 years paft the 
country about being greatly depopulated, fingle women un- 
fit for farmers fervice, or an old widow with a daughter or 
two, moft of them equally unfit, took refuge in thefe villa- 
ges, and earned their livelihood by fpinning, perhaps fome 
one of the family by hoeing turnips by the day, and hiring 
themfelves in harveft; whilft the males hired themfelves 
for herds, hinds, and farmers fervants, and were in other 
parifhes. This is not mere conjecture, for a great part of 
the paupers flpon the lift confift of fuch women, and I know 
of many more who ftill fubfift by their own labour. Be- 
fides, fome {ingle women, or widows, after obtaining a fet- 
tlement in other parifhes, come to refide in thefe villages ; 
becaufe flout women, fit to be employed the whole feafon 
in every kind of out-work, are fo fcarce in proportion to 
the demand, that no farmer will let a cottage, but upon the 
condition of being furnifhed with a worker, for whom, even 
in the turnip-feafon, they pay 8 d. or 9 d. per day, without 
viftuals. Thofe who were hired by the day in fummer

in this parifh gave for men 1 s. and 6 d. with viduals, and 
none gave below 1 s. and 4 d. For women 1 s. and 4 d. 
and none below 1 s. and 2 d. Some years ago 6 d. was rec- 
koned equal to viduals for a day : 8 d. is now thought by 
fome the proper allowance. Labourers prefer getting their 
vi&amp;uals to an allowance in money.

males.

^.-The valued rent of the parhh is L. 7049 : I3 : 4 
boots. The real rent is about L. 2104 Sterling. It may 
Jith propriety be faid to be three times more than it was 
during the remembrance of fome old people yet living. 

^^.-Till lately the ftipend was no more than r,« 
bolls oat-meal, i 4i bolls barley, 5 bolls wheat, all in Te 
Viotdale meafure, and L. 38:17:9^ in money, befides 
L. 1 : 13 : 4 for communion-elements. An augmentation 
was lately granted of 2 chalders of oat-meal, Linlithgow 
meafure, and L. 2 : 6 : 8 for communion-elements. But af- 
ter all, if one confiders, on the one hand, the great and ra- 
pid advances of rents, and on the other, the abundance of 
free teind in the parilh, and that the ftipend was never 
augmented before, he may be juftified in pronouncing it too 
fmall. Andrew Wauchope, Efq; of Niddrie is patron. 

School.— The falary belonging to the parochial fchool is 
100 merks Scots. The matter is furniftied with a good 
fchool-houfe and dwelling-houfe. There are two or three 
private fchools, for the accommodation of the inhabitants. 
The number of fchoiars may be about 80. 

Poor — The number of poor upon the roll is ufually about 
30, who receive from 2 s. 6 d. to 8 d. per week each, as 
their neceffities may require. Befides the ftated poor, fome 
needy families receive occafional fupply. The funds for 
anfvvering thefe purpofes arife chiefly from afleflments.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1985973">AULDEARN</name>, 

(County of Nairn, Synod of Moray, and Presby- 
tery of Nairn). 



By the Rev. Mr John Paterson.</head> 



<p>AULDEARN is faid by Mr Shaw's hiftory of Moray 
to be compofed of two Gaelic words, importing the 
iron-coloured brook, from a fediment of that colour occa- 
fionally thrown out by the brook, which runs weftward of 
the village. By other gentlemen fkilled in that language, 
it is fuppofed to denote the brook covered with alders, from 
the abundance of the trees fo denominated, which grew 
along the fides of it, and which ftill grow near it. It was 
formerly a place of much greater confideration than at pre- 
fent, and the feat of the Dean of Moray, who prefided over 
ten canons, and in the bifhop's abfence prefided in the chap- 
ters and in fynods. From a grant of the " lands of Penie 
(Pethenach juxta Erin perfuas reftas divifas)" in this parilh 
to the Priory of Urquhart, by David I. its ancient name 
feems to have been fimply Erin. 

The 



of Auldearn. 



The church and manfe are pleafantly fituated on a ri- 
ling ground, which commands an extenfive profpecl of the 
Moray Firth, and Bay of Cromarty, of part of five different 
fhires, and a landscape of many fhoufand acres of cultivated 
lands. They are fituated in the centre between Elgin and 
Invernefs, 20 miles from each. On the north the parilh 
extends four miles along the coaft of the Moray Firth, 6 
miles from fouth to north, and the fame from eaft to weft ; 
bounded on the fouth by the hills of Ardlach, on the weft 
by the parifli of C alder, and on the eaft by Dykes and 
Edinkaillie. The fouth-eaft part of the parilh is of a rich red 
mortar foil, of difficult cultivation, but producing luxuriant 
crops of barley, oats, and peafe. The fouth- weft divifion is 
of a mould darker, and not fo fertile as the former, and in 
late feafons the corn is liable to much damage. Around the 
-village of Auldearn the foil is light and dry, in Ihowery 
feafons recompenfing the labours of the hufbandman •, but iii 
thofe of an oppofite defcription is parched, and the crop de- 
ficient. The north part is of a cold and heavy loam, ex- 
tremely difficult in wet weather to labour in winter. The 
eaft and weft fides are oF a fimilar mould, producing weigh- 
ty crops of oats, but not fo favourable for barley, although 
barley, in general, is the grain moll congenial to the foil of 
the parilh, and vies in excellence with any in the northern 
part of this ifland. In that quarter of the parilh which is 
the property of Lord Cawdor, the ground is fo encumber- 
ed with ftones, that if his eflafe was cleared of them, it is 
computed it would rife one-fifth in value. 

Climate. — The climate is mild and fererie, at lead in the 
lower and level parts of the parifh. No'diXeafes peculiar 
to the place are prevalent. Notwithftanding the immoderate 
ufe of fpirituous liquors, the ravages which droplical and 
confumptive diftempcrs have made elfo where, are here hap-

pily unknown ; very few have fallen a Sacrifice to the finali: 
pox, though the people are in general averfe to inoculation, 
from the general gloominefsof their faith, which teaches them, 
that all difeafes which affile! the human frame are inftancea 
of the Divine interpofition, for the puniftiment of fin ; any 
interference, therefore, on their part, they deem an uiurpa- 
tion of the prerogative of the Almighty. 

State of Property.— Trie valued rent of this parifh, a- 
mounting to L. 7255, 7 s. Scots, is divided among fix heri- 
tors. Mifs Brodie of Lethen has an elegant feat in the 
fouth part of the parilh, litUated in a hollow betwixt twd 
hills, fheltered on the eaft, weft, and fouth. fides, by planta- 
tions of trees ; among which the majeftic fize of fome vene- 
rable beeches, with their luxuriant diffufion of boughs and 
tranches, mull attraft the notice of every beholder. — North 
of the church, in a delightful plain, beautifully variegated 
with wood and water, lies the family-feat of the Duribarsi 
of Boath. The garden and pleafure-grounds, with the fe- 
veral inclofures adjoining, are laid out with the utmoft ele- 
gance of tafte. The family of Boath have been proprietors 
of that eftate upwards of 250 years. — Mr Gordon of Braid 
has a fummer lodge at Kinfteary. 

The valued rents of the feveral heritors, as Hated in the 
cefs -books, are as follow, viz. : Charles Gordon's, Efq; of 
Braid, confining of Kinfteary Park, and Auldearn, L.2322, 
14 s. 4 d. Scots money. James Brodie 's, Efq; of Brodie„ 
eftates of Iriflboch, Lochloy, and Penich, L. 1599, 11 s. 
Lord Cawdor's eftates of Bogholl, Moynefs, Earlfeat, Black- 
hills, Lay lands,' and Raitlone, L. 1493 = 19 : 6. Mifs Brodie 
ofLetheri, L. 1100. Alexander Dunbar, Efq; of Boath, 
L. 652 : 15 : 9. Knockowdie, L. 96. The real rerit cord?- 
derably exceeds L. 30dd Sterling yearly. 

♦ Population, 



of Auldearn. 619 

Population.— In 1755 the po ulation is faid to have a- 
mounted to 195 1 fouls. This ftatement, however, is liable 
to the fufpicion of exaggeration ; for the laft incumbent, in 
his unfuccefsful application for an augmentation of ftipend 
the preceding year, 1754, reprefented them as amounting 
to only 1600 fouls. In an accurate lift taken fpring laft 
year (1796), the parifli was found to contain 1406 inhabi- 
tants ; 661 males, and 745 females. 

The total of thofe who follow the prqfeffion of agricul- 
ture is 127. Several mechanics and tradefmen poflcfs frrnll 
crofts, in order 10 augment the means of tubfiltence for 
themfelves and families. Of day labourers there are 43, 
11 ftioemakers, 7 faiths, 15 weavers, 8 taylors, 7 millers, 
3 1 mafons, and 9 fquare-w rights ; and there are 3 inns, and. 
4 merchants, in the village of Auldearn, which contains 41 
houfes, and 185 inhabitants. There are about 97 fece- 
ders of the Antiburgher perfuafion, who, in conjuclion with 
fome others,, attached to that feci: in the neighbouring pa- 
rifiies, contrive to fupport a clergyman of their own in Bog- 
holl, in the fouth-eaft corner of the parifli, and confines of 
Edinkaiilie. 

This fecefiion from the communion of the eftabliihed re- 
ligion began about 40 years fince, and is now rather on the j 
decline. AH the reft belong to the eftablifliment, and join 
with it, at lead in religious ordinances, although their attach- 
ment to puritanical doctrines makes many of them wander 
miles to hear popular and applauded preachers.

By reafon of the negligence of the feffion-clerk of that 
period, the lift of baptifms for 5 years previous to 1755, 
which would have afforded the faireft point of comparison, 
has been very inaccurately kept. From the above view it 
appears, that the population has decreafed conliderably, 
owing, as in other places, to the enlargement of farms, and 
flocking of voung men to manufacturing towns. 

Advantages and Difadvantages of the Parifh, and Mif- 
cellaneous Obfervations. — There are few natural woods of 

any

any extent, but one of birch on the eflate of Infhock, the 
property of Mr Brodie of Brodie ; and from this wood the 
neighbourhood are generally fupplied with moft of their im- 
plements of hufbandry. Here likewife are fome valuable 
firs, equal in quality to thofe of Glenmore, and which fell 
at a milling a foot cubic. There are, however, large plan- 
tations of firs interfperfed with laryx, and every fpecies of 
hard wood known in Scotland reared on the eftates of all 
the proprietors ; but the moft confiderable on that of Mr 
Gordon of Braid. The exertions of this gentleman, in the 
improvement and embellimment of his eflate, by planting 
of trees and hedges, draining of marines, burfting of ftones 
by gun-powder, and inclofing of his grounds, and thus fur- 
nifhing conftant employment to the induftrious poor in this 
quarter, deferve much praife. The extent of ground covered 
by Mr Gordon's plantations, including the clumps and belts 
of his pleafure-ground, exceed 600 acres-, and their thinnings 
have already been very ferviceable for firing, and various 
other country purpofes, — From the appearance of the dips 
and rifes of the various ftrata of metals betwixt the houfe 
of Boath and the fea, it has appeared probable to fome per- 
fons of fagacity and obfervation, that coal might be procu- 
red at an expence nowife inadequate to the object, by means 
of a fire-engine planted near the fea-fliore. And on that 
property there is a quarry of dark-blue ftone, which mounts 
like coal into a blaze by the operation of fire, but is not 
confumed thereby, nor diffolves in water like limeftone. 

An almoft inexhauftible fund of marl may be found in. 
Loch Lity, upon Lord Cawdor's eftate, covering about 40 
acres of fixrface, to the depth of from 16 to 20 feet ; the lake 
might be drained by a fmall fire-engine of L. 60 or L. 70 
value. Few of the parifhioners have made application to 
Lord Cawdor in order to avail themfelves of this valuable 
manure. The moft confiderable mofs belongs to Mr Brodie

pf Brodie. Some other proprietors pretend to have for 
tudes oh it, though with the origin of their claims the ore- 
lent writer is unacquainted. The tenants are occupied du- 
ring the greater part of the fummer in digging, preparing, 
and bringing home their peats. If there was regular ; 
plies of coals brought to Nairn, this labour might in a good 
meafure be fuperfeded, and the attention of the hufband: 
might, to much better purpofe, be directed to his proper em- 
ployment during that feafon. Large planks of fir are con- 
tained in the bottom of this mofs, which ferve for couples 
and lath to houfes. Trees have been found 60 feet long, 
and 3 feet fquare. On the coaft, on the north part of the pa- 
rifh, lies an inconiiderable lake called Loch Loy, of a mile 
\n length, and a quarter broad, rather below the level of the 
fea. It has formerly undoubtedly been much larger than 
its prefent extent, but gradually contracted by the blowing 
of the fands in its neighbourhood, in which are two of thofe^ 
hills pf flu&amp;uating fand described more at large in the ac- 
count of Dyke. 

Thefe hijls have fhifted eaftward, within thefe ?o years 
500 yards, Mill prefervi their magnitude and relative di- 
(lance. The largeft ji thefe hills is about 100 yards per- 
pendicular.-— There are three markets held annually in this 
village; one upon the 21ft June, called St C pirn's mar ket^ 
in honour, it is fupppfed, of St Colum^a, the founder of the 
monaftery of lona. 

"The State of jfgriculture.~-The inhabitants are tenacious 
pf antiquated practices, and admit of the improvements of 
enlightened experience by flow degrees. The mode is not 
materially altered from that in ufe 30 years lince. When the. 
corns are got clear off" the ground, they begin to give a rib- 
furrow acrofs the field intended for bar'ey or peafe ; when 
that is prer, if the feafon prove favourable, they give a

Bean forrow to their laft year's barley-ground, for oats, 
which are begun to be fown the 28th of March, and finim- 
ed the 5th of April \ then they begin td ipread their dun g 
and give a clean furrow to their barley-groUnd; a third fur- 
row precedes the fowiiig of the barley ; begun the 8th May, 
and finiflied towards the conclufion bf that month. 

The harveft, in indulgent feafons, begins loth Septem- 
ber, and ends about the laft days of October. The common 
mode of preparing their dung for barley, is otic half dung, 
and the other haif mortar, but more frequently fand. 

The better fort of tenants have ploughs of the Englife 
conftrufitibn, drawn by a couple of horfes 1 ; others rire the 
bid Scots plough, drawn by 6 or 8 oxenj where the ground 
is ftony and of hard culture. The former makes life o£ 
box-carts, and the latter of kellocks; for conveying the 
com poll which they ufe for manure. The kellock is of a co- 
nical figUre, conftru&amp;ed of twigs bf broom or juniper, 
interwoven in the man tier of balkets j the fabrication of 
which furniihes employment to fome of the labouring 
poor. It is fufperided by two fliafts, in which a fingle horfe 
is placed, and fet oh a ckimfy two-wheeled carriage. The 
kellock is in value I s. and Aider and wheels 4 s. The; 
common rotation of crops after breakifig up the grafs-field 
is, ijiy Two of oats, in fucceflion; 2d, Barley; 3d, Oats J 
4th, Peafe j and thereafter barley, with clover-feeds, bothl 
white and red. All kinds of clover are fown here, though 
but lately introduced ; they are ufed here even only by the 
more opulent, little hay being raifed by the pooreft fort; 
The labouring cattle are weak and rfarving in the fpring* 
for want of fodder, and are fed on, ftraw. They are thus 
often under the neceffity of fending their cattle to the High- 
lands in fummer, whence they return in as wretched a con- 
dition as they are fent. Potatoes, forming the fubfiftencc 
fcf the people one-third of the year, are planted by every

rank ; by the more fubftantial they are drilled, by the poor- 
er they are planted in every furrow. The latter, though 
not fo produftive as the other, yet are efteemed better food. 
The ordinary return of an acre of drilled potatoes is about 
16 bolls, but that of the other fort is not fo abundant. The 
barley of this pariih is in high demand among diftillers, and 
weighs between 17 and 19 (tone, Amfterdam weight. A- 
bove 2000 bolls of barley, and an equal quantity of oats, 
befides what is necefTary for the maintenance of the inhabi- 
tants, are annually exported. No peafe are raifed but for 
home confumption, and little wheat, till laft year, that, 
alured by the high prices of that grain, fome farmers have 
begun to direft their attention to its cultivation, and, it is 
hoped, will find their account in it. The belt cultivated 
fields let from 25 s. to 36 s. per acre ; but in the hilly parts 
rarely above 15 s. The raoft extenfive farmers rent from 
L. 60 to L. 80 Sterling ; the fmalleft from L. 10 to L. 26. 
Sterling. None of the proprietors have inclofed any of 
their grounds, nor give encouragement to their tenants to 
do fo, although raoft of them would give chearfully an ad- 
vance of rent to have them inclofed, as their neighbours 
feed their cattle promifcuoufly from the end of harveft to 
the firft of April, which prevents improving tenants from 
railing turnips, wheat, or fown-grafs to advantage. 

The horfes in this parifh, about 370 in number, are of a 
fmall fize, from L. 6 to L. 10 a-piece in value ; thofe poffef- 
fed by the more opulent from L. 10 to L. 20 Sterling. The 
black cattle, in number 910, are of a mixed breed ; Lan- 
cafhire, Dutch, Fifefliire, and Highland ; though the laft 
mentioned fpecies furpafles the others in number. The fmall- 
eft will weigh from 50 to 60 lb. per quarter, 1 7^- oz. Am- 
sterdam weight : The middling fize from 70 to 80 lb. the 
quarter : The largeft fize from ico to 140 lb. the quarter.

the ewes weighing from 6 to 10 lb. per quarter, and the 
wethers from 8 to 12 lb. per quarter. Their wool is e- 
fteemed, and reckoned preferable to that of the large black- 
faced. 

No manufacture, flax-mill, or bleachiield, have yet been 
eftablifhed here, though the parifli is fuppofed to be [,oflef- 
fed of lingular advantages for them all, and likewife for 
fome branch of thread or flocking manufactory. 

The ftipend, by decreet 1755, was fixed to be 6 chalders 
of victual, half barley, half oat-meal, 400 merks Scots, with 
L. 60 Scots for communion-money, 14 wethers, and 11 mil- 
lings feu-duty for the Dean's Crook near Elgin. But by an 
interlocutor of the Court of Teinds, 24th February 1796, 
the minifter's ftipend is augmented L. 21 Sterling annually; 
and the meal altered from 48 bolls of the meafure ufedand 
wont, to 54 bolls, at 8 (lone per boll. 

The church was built in the year 1757, and is Mill in 
good repair ; the manfe was built in 1751, was refitted laft 
fummer, and is now well finiflied, at the expence of above 

200 Sterling. 

The fchoolmafter's falary is 16 bolls barley. The fehool- 
houfe is decent ; about 30 fcholars attend, who are initiated 
in the elements of Latin, Englifh, writing, and arithmetic ; 
his fee as feffion-clerk is variable, arifing from the fines of 
delinquents. The funds for the fupport of the poor arife 
from the weekly collection and mortcloth-money, amount- 
ing to the fmall fum of between L. 8 and L.9 Sterling year- 
ly, with the intereft, of L. 94 Sterling, accumulated by the 
attention of the late incumbent. The number of poor on 
the roll are 56. Mr Brodie of Brodie is patron of this pa- 
rifli. 

The inhabitants are fufHciently turned to the devout vir- 
tues •, but their zeal not being of that fort which is founded 
in knowledge, and which adds ftrength and ftability to vir-

tue, is conceived by them to imply fuch a degree of merit 
as to emancipate them in fome meafure from the reftraints 
of morality. There are not wanting inftances of petty 
thefts, yet they have never been difgraced by any crime of 
fo flagrant a nature as to fubjedt. them to a trial before a cri- 
minal court ; and their faults are in general the offspring of 
ignorance and illiberal prejudice, rather than of a corrupted 
heart. 

There are veftiges of two Druidical temples, but not fo 
entire as to merit particular defcription. Hard by the 
church is a green mount, in form alnvft perfectly circular, 
commonly called Caftle Hill, which has all the appearance 
pf artificial formation, and was probably one of thofe places 
which antiquarians conje&amp;ure to have been deftined for the 
purpofe of holding affizes.

(County of Argyle, Synod of As&amp;yle, and Presby- 
tery OF KlNTYRE.) 

By the Rev. Alexander Stuart.</head> 



<p>Situation, 

THIS parifli (which confifted of two parifties till after 
the Reformation) derives its name from its two pa- 
tron faints, John and Kenneth, with Kill (Cellri) prefixed. 
It is fituated in the prelbytery of Kintyre, and county of 
Argyle. It is bounded on the fouth by the parifli of Camp- 
belltown, on the north by the pariih of Kilcalmonell, on the 
eaft by the united parifhes of Saddel and Skipnefs, and on 
the weft by the Atlantic O cean. Its length, by the mea- 
surement of the road, is 18 miles; and its breadth about 4. 

Soil, — The foil along the coaft is in general (harp and 
fandy, but yields- good crops of bear, potatoes, and oats, 
from the abundant application of fea-ware, driven in by the 
ftorms, and collected by the farmers for manure. The 
arable ioil upon the higher grounds is generally a thin coat 
of peat earth, on a till bottom. In the mountain there is 
very little of green pafture, being moftly covered with 
heath, 

Climate,—- 



Statijlical Account 



Climate.— This parifh, as it faces the Atlantic Ocean, is 
much expofed to the weflerly winds, and the rains which 
generally accompany them. The climate may be faid to 
be moid, or even wet, but not very cold, on account of 
the vicinity of the fea. — The people are generally heal- 
thy, and fubjedt to few difeafes. The prejudice againft in- 
oculation for the fmall -pox is now done away; and that 
difeafe, formerly fo fatal to children, very feldom proves 
mortal ; of 100 children inoculated laft year not one died. 

Antiquities. — The antiquities of the parifh confift of a 
number of Danifli forts, fome rude obelifks, and the re- 
mains of one vitrified tower. One of the obelifks (which 
Hands on an eminence, to which it mufl have been carried 
from fome confiderable diflance) meafures 16 feet above 
ground, and is 4 feet broad, by 2ifeet thick ; a curious mo- 
nument of the knowledge which our forefathers muft have 
had of the mechanic powers. 

Church, Stipend, 13 c. — Extenfive as this parifh ftill is, it 
was much more lb before the late incumbent, Mr Robert 
Thomfon, after much trouble and expence, got a part of it 
disjoined, and formed into a new erection, together with a 
part of the neighbouring parifh of Kilcalmonell. In this; 
laudable undertaking his merit was the greater, as his li- 
ving at the time was only L. 50 a-year, with which he had 
to fupport and educate a numerous family. But he was a 
man who made little account of his private intereft when 
engaged in any fcheme for the public good. He afterwards 
got his living augmented to what is at prefent enjoyed by 
the writer of this, namely, 6 chalders of bear, Kintyre mea- 
fure, and L. 18, 10 s. Sterling money, together with a glebe, 
and L. 12, 10 s. in lieu of manfe. The Duke of Argyle is

Statiflical Account 

Agriculture.^ there are but few inclofures in the pa- 
nfli, agricultural improvements are not greatly advanced in 
it. From the attention, however, which fome of the heri- 
tors have of late given to thefe matters, there is reafon to 
beheve that the face of the country will foon put on a bet- 
ter appearance. The Duke of Argyle makes it a cove- 
nant in the leafes which he gives his tenants, that they {hall 
drain and inclofe to a certain extent fpecified ; and his Grace 
employs a fldlful improver to fuperintend the operations. 

The average returns throughout the parim is fuppofed 
to be, from oats from bear about 6; from potatoes 
from 12 to 15 ; potatoes are almoft the only green crop cul- 
tivated by the farmers. The quantity of beans and peas which 
is fown is not confiderable ; but there is reafon to believe, as 
they anfwer well, that the cultivation of them will be mpre 
attended to in a very Ihort time. The farmers are alfo be- 
ginning to find the advantage of having fome clover and 
rye-grafs, and the cultivation of thefe articles will probably, 
in a few years, be very confiderable. A few have raifed 
turnips, and no doubt many would do fo if the lands were 
inclofed. The greateft defect in our farming, is the want 
Of a proper intermixture of green with white crops. The 
farmers, and indeed the people in general, are active, 
induftrious, and well behaved. No doubt their labour will 
turn foon to more account, as better implements of hufban- 
dry are now introduced among them. Many, mftead of 
the old Scotch plough and 4 horfes, ufe now Small's light 
plough and only 2 horfes , and a few have laid afide the 
driver. More attention is alfo paid to the breed of horfes 
and black cattle. There is only one confiderable fheep- 
ftock in the parilh, in a mountainous farm. All the far- 
mers have a few for their own ufe ; thefe are of the old 
iinaU white-faced kind, which have more delicate flelh 

and 



of KiUean and Kilcbenzic. 631 

and finer wool, and are not fo fubjeft to difeafes as the Gal- 
loway breed, 

Wages of Servants.— -The wages of fervants are conftant- 
ly advancing. At prefent a fervant man gets from L. 8 
to L. 10 a-year, and a fervant maid L. 3, befides a va- 
riety of articles under the name of bounty ; a day-labour- 
er gets is. a-day and his viftuals; a tailor iod.j a 
flioemaker 8 d. for the making of a pair of flioes ; a carpen- 
ter 1 s. 6 d. together, all, with their vi&amp;uals. Blackfmith$ 
are paid by fo much corn from the merk-land ; a pra&amp;ice 
troublefome to them and the tenants both, and which ought 
to be laid afide, and money fubftituted in its place. The 
fame obfervation will apply to the fchoolmafter on the pa- 
rochial eftabliftiment. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The advantages of the 
parifh are, a good road, its vicinity to the fea, and to a mar- 
ket at Caropbelltown, with abundance of natural manure 
from fea-ware and lime-ftone. — Its greateft difadvantages 
are, want of timber, and fcarcity of fuel in many farms, on 
which the peat-mofles are now exhaufted.

Communications by Alexander Carnegie, Efq; Town-Clerk of 
Aberdeen, regarding the Statijlical Gircumjlances of that 
City. See No. IV. 

r ~j~  HE city of Aberdeen, is one of the mod ancient, and 
is endowed with fome of the greateft privileges and 
immunities, of any of the royal boroughs in Scotland. 

All hiftorical accounts agree, that it was originally erect- 
ed into a royal burgh, towards the end of the ninth century, 
by King Gregory of Scotland, lirnamed the Great. 

But the original charter of erection, and all the more an- 
cient title-deeds and records of the burgh, were, along with 
the town itfelf, burnt and deftroyed by the Englilh, as 
after noticed. 

A very few charters and other grants, however, have 
been faved ; the oldeft of which is a charter by King Wil- 
liam the Lyon, in favour of the burgeffes of Aberdeen and 
others be-north the Month, granted at Perth, but without 
any date or year, though it muft have been towards the 
end of the twelfth century, as that King only began to reign 
in 1165. 

There are other two charters granted by the fame King 
William, to the burgeffes of Aberdeen, of the toll of their 
chatties through the whole kingdom ; both of them dated 
at Aberdeen, the 28th of Auguft, without mentioning 
either the year of God or King's reign, although, from the 
writing and feals, they appear to be of a later date than the 

Vol. XIX. a former 



2 appendix to the 

former one, and have probably been granted during King 
William's refidence here, as he certainly built a palace, and 
remained fome time with his Court at Aberdeen. 

The palace flood upon the fite of the prefentTrinity,Church 
and Trades Hofpital, in the Shiprow ; and upon King Wil- 
liam's leaving this country, he founded, in the fame place, a 
monaftery for the Trinity or Red Friars, which was burnt 
down and deftroyed along with the town. It was after- 
wards rebuilt about the year 1633, by Dr William Guild, 
minifter in Aberdeen, who bequeathed and left it for an 
hofpital to decayed tradefmen, befides fome other fubje&amp;s 
for burfaries at the Marifchall College, under the patronage 
of the Convener Court. 

In ,1306-7, • according to Heclor Boece, the citizens of 
Aberdeen, who had always fteadily adhered to and fup- 
ported Robert Bruce's intereft, being rendered defperate 
by the cruel and oppreffive ufage of a ftrong Englifh garri- 
fon, kept in the caftle there by Edward I. they, along with 
a number of others, adherents to Bruce's intereft, furprifed 
and ftormed that garrifon, and put them to the fword, at 
fame time laid the caftle in ruins, in order to prevent the 
Englifh from returning. 

A party of the Englifh, who happened to be in the neigh- 
bourhood, came immediately to revenge the difefter which 
had befallen their countrymen ; but they were met and en- 
gaged by the Aberdonians and their aflbciates, in the 
church-yard of St Nicholas^ where the Englifh were totally 
defeated with great flaughter. Although Boece does not 
fpecify the particular year when thefe defeats of the Eng- 
lifh happened at Aberdeen, yet, from its connection with 
the fubjecls of the context, where it is introduced in the lift 
of Bifhop Henry Cheyne, it appears to have been at or 
near the above period, and he thus relates them : " Eo 
" prope tempore Brufiani, Aberdonenfem arcem quam

In 1398, Robert Bruce, after being defeated in different 
engagements, came to Aberdeen, at'\fhich time he was fo 
exceedingly fick, that he began almoft to defpair of the re- 
covery of his health, as well as of his kingdom ; but being 
encouraged, and offered affiftance, both in men and money, 
by the Citizens of Aberdeen, and joined by a confiderable 
number of them, he Went northward in fearch of the Eng- 
lifli army, commanded by John Cuming Earl of Buchan, 
and Moubray, an Englifh General, whom he came up with, 
and engaged, upon the 22d of May in that year, near to the 
town of Inverury, where a moft bloody battle enfued ; and 
although Bruce was then fo weak, that he was obliged to be 

fupported

•which he had obtained. 

i ThC Charter nuvv exta ^ in favour of the burgh itfelf, 
is granted by King Robert Bruce, in 13,0, which contains 
alio a gift and conveyance to the community of the Royal 
Foreft of Stocket, Belides which, he, by feveral other 
charters, granted various farther privileges and immunities 
to the burgh and citizens of Aberdeen, feveral of which 
are likewife ftill extant from the ,314 downward to 
1329. 

In 1333, Edward IJI. of England having fent a fleet of 
fhips to ravage the eaft coaft of Scotland, a body of Englifh 
landed, and, by furprife, attacked the town of Aberdeen in 
the night-time, killed a great number of the inhabitants, 
and burnt and deftroyed the town for fix days together, in 
revenge of the feveral defeats which their countrymen had 
there received. And Boece, in his Hiftory of the Lives of 
the Bifhops of Aberdeen, thus relates that direful cataftrophe 
which befel the town, viz.— " Per id tempus triginta naves 
" Anglican*, in ftatione portui Aberdonenfi proxima no&amp;u 
* jecere anchoras, unde expofit* copiat in terram pene Aher- 
" donium prius funt ingreffae, quam cives eas adveniffe fen-

Alfo, in 1336, Edward III. invaded Scotland, and march- 
ed with an army as far northward as Invernefs, during 
which time the citizens of Aberdeen went out and attacked 
a party of Englilh forces, who had landed at Dunnottar, 
and killed their General. In revenge of which, Edward, 
upon his return from Invernefs, made a violent attack upqn 
the town of Aberdeen, put the greateft part of the inhabi- 
tants to the fword, and again burnt and deftroyed the town. 
At which time, as well as the 1333, all the more ancient 
charters and records belonging to the community, (a few ex- 
cepted) were loft. Some years afterwards, the town was re- 
built of new, and confiderably enlarged, particularly toward 
the hills, upon which the principal part of it now ftands, 
viz. the Woolman-hill, St Catharine's-hill, the Port-hill, 
and Caftle hill, (the old town having lain along the Green 
and Shiprow, &amp;c. eaftwards), and in this the citizens were 
greatly affifted by King David Bruce, for their fteady loyal- 
ty and attachment both to himfelf and his father ; and the 
fame King David refided for fome time at Aberdeen, where 
he erefted a mint, as appears from fome pieces of money 
coined there ; and the whole town, after being rebuilt as 
above, was afterwards called the New Town of Aberdeen, 

m 

in contra-diftindrion to the Old, which had been burnt down. 
Boece, who likewife gives an account of the laft, as well as 
the former burning of the town, thus relates the fecond, 
viz. " King Edward, dradand to tyne all the ftrength of 
* Scotland, came with XLM men to the relief of the Caftle 
" of Lochendors, and after he had fluffed it with provifions, 

V he

" he came with bloody fword through Murray; and on his 
44 returning to Mar, he burnt the town of Aberdeen." 

• In 141 1, Donald, the Chief of the Ifles, with an army of 
his countrymen, having made an attack, and feized upon 
Rofs and Murray, proceeded fouth wards as far as Strath- 
bogie, and threatened to invade Aberdeen ; the citizens, to 
a confiderable number, along with Robert Davidfon, their 
then Provoft, being joined by the Earl of Marr, and many 
of the nobility and gentry of Angus, Mearns, and Aber- 
deenfhire, went northward in fearch of Donald and his for- 
ces, and came up with them at a fmall village called Har- 
law, about fixteen Englilh miles from Aberdeen, where 
there enfued a moft defperate and bloody battle, which con- 
tinued with great fury until night feparated them ; and each 
party claimed the vi&amp;ory. Many were flain in this battle 
on both fides, particularly Provoft Davidfon, and a confi- 
derable number of the principal citizens of Aberdeen. 

In September 1644, during the time of the civil wars, 
the Marquis of Montrofe, with an army of about 2000 men, 
having approached the town of Aberdeen, and fummoned 
it to furrender to him, the Magiftrates, after advifing 
with Lord Burleigh, who then commanded in the town a 
force nearly equal in number to the affailants, refufed to 
give up the town, upon which a battle enfued within half 
an Englifh mile of the town, at a place called the Crab- 
Hone, near to the Juftice-mills, where Montrofe prevailed, 
and many of the principal citizens were killed. 

The city of Aberdeen has received various grants from 
fourteen different Sovereigns of Scotland, from King Wil- 
liam the Lyon, downward to King James VI. inclufive, all 
extant in the town's chartulary. And in 1638, the whole 
of thefe preceding grants and charters were, by a charter 
from King Charles I. not only ratified and confirmed, but 
alfo the burgh was of new ere&amp;ed. And by the fame 

charter, 



Statiftical Account of Aberdeen. 



charter, the Provoft and Bailies are created and conftituted 
Sheriffs, Coroners, and Juftices of the Peace, within the 
burgh, and whole bounds of the freedom-lands. The Pro- 
voft being named Sheriff and Coroner-principal, and the 
four Bailies, Sheriffs and Coroners-depute ; which feveral 
offices of Sheriffs and Juftices of the Peace, the Magiftrates 
of Aberdeen have been in the conftant practice of exerci- 
fing to the prefent day, in all caufes coming before them in 
thefe capacities, and of holding quarter- feffions for the burgh, 
in the fame manner as the Juftices of the county. The 
Magiftrates have farther granted to them, by faid charter, 
the fame powers, jurisdiction, and authority within the port, 
harbour, and flood-mark of Aberdeen, and whole bounds 
thereof, as well as within the rivers of Dee and Don, to 
the two bridges, as they have within the burgh itfelf and 
liberties, and have always exereifed that jurifdi&amp;ion and 
authority accordingly. 

The Town-council and Dean of Guild of Aberdeen have 
likewife, by the fame charter from King Charles I. full 
power and authority committed to them, of vifiting, exami- 
ning, and trying all weights and meafures ufed in buying 
and felling, not only in the town, but alfo through the 
whole county of Aberdeen, which they have in like man- 
ner been in the practice of exercHing; and of holding circuit 
and itinerant courts for that purpofe, in the different princi- 
pal country towns, where any kind of trade or merchandife 
is carried on. 

The forefaid charter and confirmation by King Charles I. 
with the whole other writs and title-deeds therein confirm r 
ed, and rights and privileges thereby granted to the burgh, 
were afterwards folemnly ratified by different ads of the Par- 
liament of Scotland, particularly by two afts, in 1641, and 
1681. 

From 



Appendix to the 



From the 1336, when the town was laft burnt, to tU 
1398, there does not appear to have been any regular public 
records kept ; but from the laft mentioned period to the 
prefent time, (except for about twelve years in the begin- 
ning of the fifteenth century), there is a regular and unin- 
terrupted feries of records of the ads and procedure, both of 
the Town-Council and Bailie -courts, all in good order and 
Condition, confifting of above feventy volumes, remaining 
in the town's chartulary, containing, in whole, a period o£ 
near 400 years. 

The burgh of Aberdeen comprehends but one parifh, 
called St Nicholas, which has no landward or country 
bounds, but is limited to the burgh itfelf, which does not 
extend above two Englifh miles in circumference, and is 
furrounded on all fides by the parifh of Old Machar, ex- 
cept towards the eaft. The Magiftrates, however, by the 
above charters and ads of Parliament, enjoy and exercife 
the fame powers and jurifdiclion as they have within the 
burgh or royalty, over a large tract of land in the neigh- 
bourhood of the town, confifting of what is called the liber- 
ties or freedom, which will extend in circuit from twelve to 
fourteen Englifh miles. 

Before the Reformation, there were feveral chapels with- 
in the burgh and royalty annexed to, and dependent upon, 
the parifh-church, particularly St Mary's Chapel, under the 
Eaft Church, where the Highland Congregation now meets 
for worfhip ; St Catherine's Chapel, which flood upon the 
hill of that name ; St Ninian's Chapel, at the Caftlehill, 
part of which ftill remains ; and St Clement's Chapel at 
Footdee, which has been lately rebuilt, and is ftill occupied 
as a place of worfhip, under the patronage of the Council. 

There was another chapel, called St John's, fituated 
within the royalty of the burgh, although without the 
bounds of the parifh of St Nicholas, upon that croft of 

land 



Stattjiical Account of Aberdeen. 9 

land called St John's Croft, where the Chapel of Eafe to 
the parim of Old Machar now ftands. The Magiftrate* 
and Council appear to have purchafed the patronage of 
St John's, on .account of its vicinity to the town, and fixa- 
tion within the royalty. There were likewife monatteries 
of feveral different orders of Friars eftabhfhed in Aberdeen, 
befide the Trinity or Red Friars already mentioned, viz, 
the Black Friars in the Schoolhill, where Gordon's Hofri- 
tal and the Grammar-fchool now Hand } the Carmelite or 
White Friars, along the fouth fide of the Green; and the 
Grey Friars, in the Broadgate, where the Marifchal Col- 
lege and Church are now fituated. 

The number of Advocates, or Lawyers, in Aberdeen, 
under the incorporation charter, will be feen from the 
Aberdeen Almanack?; although five or fix do not praftife 
before the Courts, and fome others are removed from 
town. 

EreBion of the New Pier, and the great Advantages 
arifing from ih— The New Pier lately erefted on the north 
fide of the entry of the harbour of Aberdeen, and at the 
mouth of the river Dee, extending to 1200 feet in length 
along the fide of that river, and a confiderable way into the 
fea, was begun to be built in June 1775, and was finifhed 
in October 1780, according to a plan furnifhed by John 
Smeaton, Efq; engineer ; the expence whereof, and of the 
additions which have been made to it, by his advice and 
dire&amp;ions, fince it was built, particularly a jettie or catch 
pier, for fheltering the Ihipping within the harbour from 
the violent inrun of the fea in eafterly ftorms, has amounted 
to about L. 18,000 Sterling. This expence has been de- 
frayed, partly by fome fmall funds formerly belonging to 
the harbour, but chiefly will be paid by the doubling of 
the fhore and harbour dues upon the trade and fhipping of 

Vol. XIX. b the 



io appendix to the 

the place, in confequence of an ad of Parliament obtained 
ior that purpofe, but without any public aid or contribution 
whatever. 

By the ereftion of this pier, the navigation channel at 
the entry of the harbour has been deepened and improved 
to a degree much beyond any thing that was previoufly ex- 
peeled, although it be 200 feet fliorter than Mr Smeaton'i. 
original plan, which was in whole 1400 feet in length. 
Before ereftion of the North Pier, the harbour-mouth was 
always very much interrupted, and fometimes almoft en- 
tirely fhut up by a bar, or large bank of mifting fand, upon 
winch, at low water, there was fometimes not ^above 18 
inches or 2 feet in deepnefs and at high water, even in 
fpring-tides, not above 13 feet ; and as this bar was fre- 
quently fliifting and varying its fituation, according as it 
was acled upon by the ftorms of the fea or the floods of the 
river, few fhipping were in fafety to take the harbour until 
firft it was founded by a pilot, and the fituation of the bar, 
as well as the deepnefs of water, afcertained ; whereas, 
fince the North Pier was built, fmall vefTels, drawing 7 or 
8 feet, have come into the harbour at low-water ; and at 
high-water, on fpring-tides, there is now from 18 to 20 feet 
in deepnefc at the entry, as the former bar, or bank of fand, 
is now, by the confinement of the river, and the increafed 
velocity of the current, carried out into the fea at lean: a 
quarter of a mile farther than it formerly was ; fo that we 
now fee veffels of considerable burden, in the violence of 
a ftorm blowing right upon the land, making for and failing 
into the harbour with fafety, even without the afiiftance of 
any pilot, which no fliip could have before attempted, with- 
out the greateft danger of being wrecked on the bar, or 
fome part of the adjacent coaft.

Ibt Battery, .-The batteries ereded by the town m 
1781 and 1782, for defence of the harbour and Ihipping, 
have coft about L. 1200; and they have mounted upon 
them ten new iron cannon, twelve pounders. The town 
have likewife two brafs field-pieces, three pounders, with 
a proportionable quantity of mot, amunition and laboratory 
Itores. They have alfo 400 ftand of fmall arms, or muf- 
kets, depofited in the town's armory, and kept always in 
excellent order by a tradefman, who has a yearly falary for 
that purpofe. 

Of the Municipal Form of Government, or Set of the Burgh. 
—With refpea to the prefent municipal conftitution and 
form of government of the burgh of Aberdeen, which has 
now fubfifted, and been invariably obferved, for no lefs than 
two centuries downward to this day, it is founded chiefly 
upon the afts of Parliament 1469 and 1474, by which « AU 
» officers and Members of the Councils of Burghs are ap- 
« pointed to be annually eleaed : That the Auld Coun- 
" cil of the town mail chufe the New in lie number as ac- 
« cords to it : And that the New and Auld Councils to- 
«? gether mall chufe all the faid officers : That the craft 
« frail chufe a perfon of their number, that mall alfo have 
" a vote in the eledtion of thefe officers : And that four 
«* worthy perfons of the Auld Council for the year before 
" mall be chofen yearly to fit with the New Council." 

It appears, however, that thefe a&amp;s of Parliament were 
not in any part obferved by the Town-Council of Aber- 
deen for above 120 years after they were palled. On the 
contrary, they perfifted in following what they called the 
ancient form of government, and auld confuetude of the

another year, and the remaining fifteen members are annu- 
ally changed and go out : And all of them are yearly d c £t- 
cd, without any preference or difcrimination, from a roll or 
M of the whole burgeiTes of guild in town, and of the fix 
deacons of trades, previoufly made up for the purpofe, from 
which the leets of the new Council are taken, and deter- 
mined always according to the majority of votes of the 
Council upon the day of the annual eleaion, which is held 
upon the Wednefday preceding Michaelmas day. 

After eledion of the nineteen members of the new Coun- 
cil, the Magiftrates, and other office-bearers for the enfuing 
year, are eleded the fame day out of the feventeen Mer- 
chant-Counfellors, by the majority of votes of the new and 
old Councils together, and fix deacons of crafts, confifting 
of forty perfons in whole, viz. thirty guild-brethren and ten 
craftfmen; and in cafe of an equality of votes in any of the 
ileps of eleaion, the Provoft, or fenior Magiftrate prefent, 
has a decifive or calling vote, befide his own individual and 
proper voice. 

In cafe of any of the thirty guild-brethren or ten tradef- 
men being abfent from the eleaion, the Town-Council and 
the Craftfmen are refpeafully authorifed by the fet, to eleft 
any other qualified perfons of the clafs, to fupply the place 
of and vote for fuch abfents. Upon the whole, ir is belie, 
ved, from a comparative examination, that the prefent mu- 
nicipal conftitution, or fet of this burgh, will be found not 
only to be a perfea contrail to its own more arbitrary and 
ancient fyflem of government, but alfo to be much more 
liberal and free than moll of the other royal boroughs of 
Scotland. Becaufe, in many of them, fome of the members 
of Council, and even Magiftrates, do ftill continue in office 
during life, or fo long as they agree with the party in 
power. And in others, feveral of the members of Council 
are entitled' to keep they- feats without election for a fecond 

year.

for the preceding. Whereas, in Aberdeen, every Magi- 
ftrate and member of Council, even the old four, muft be 
annually eleded, without regard to any office which they 
may have formerly held ; and fifteen of the whole number 
are yearly changed and go out. 

N. B. The fubflance of the principal hiftorical facls con- 
tained in the above narrative (which do not appear in any 
of the town's records) are taken from a fmall treatife, en- 
titled, " A Survey of the City of Aberdeen," printed and 
publifhed in 1685, to all appearance by a burgefs or citizen, 
Under the fignature of Philo Politicus, which has always 
been held, and appears to be authentic, except in point of 
chronology, and to correfpond in all the effential facts with 
the other authors cited and referred to by him, viz. Camb- 
den, Spotifwood, Fordan, and Boece's hiftories. 

Building of the Bridges o/"Don and Dee. 
Bridge of Don.— In 128 1, Henry Cheyne (nephew ot 
John Comyn, who was killed by Robert Bruce at Dumfries 
in 1305), fucceeded to the bifhoprick of Aberdeen. After; 
Comyn's death, Bifhop Cheyne, from his being fo near st 
relation to Comyn, as well as many others in Scotland, were 
greatly enraged at Robert Bruce upon account of Comyn's 
death, and openly efpoufed the intereft and party of the 
Comyns. For this reafon, after Robert Bruce became fet 
tied in the Throne and Government, Bifhop Cheyne was 
obliged to fly into England, and remain there for feveral 
years, during which time the revenues of his bifhoprick re- 
mained unapplied. But King Robert, having been after- 
wards reconciled to Bifhop Cheyne, was pleafed to allow him 
to return and poffefs the fee of Aberdeen as formerly. The 
Bifhop was fo happy upon his being again received into the 

King's 



16 -Appendix, Uc. 

King's favour, that, upon his return home, he, with the con- 
currence and approbation of his Sovereign, applied the whole 
rents of his bimoprick, which, during his abfence in Eng- 
land, had accumulated to a confiderable fum, towards build- 
ing the bridge over Don, of one large Gothic arch, where it 
now ftands, upon the great high-road leading northward 
from Aberdeen ; and it appears to have been built about the 
year 1320. Bilhop Cheyne died in 1329. 

Bridge of Dee.— Bilhop William Elphinfton left a confi- 
derable legacy to build a bridge over the river Dee, near 
Aberdeen, as well as for the erection of an Univerfity at Old 
Aberdeen, where the Bilhop 's Cathedral flood, but died in 
15 14, before any thing was done in the building of the 
bridge. Gavin Dunbar, fon to Sir James Dunbar of Cum- 
nock, by Eliiabeth daughter of the Earl of Sutherland, and 
uncle to Gavin Dunbar, Archbifliop of Glafgow, having 
fucceeded to the bilhoprick of Aberdeen in 15 18, he foon 
thereafter caufed colled and receive the money which had 
been left by Bilhop Elphinfton for the building of this 
bridge •, and having alfo contributed himfelf a confiderable 
fum of money to that work, he caufed erect the greateft part 
of the bridge where it now ftands, of feven arches, about the 
year 1530, although it was not finiflied till after his death. 
This bridge having gone into decay about the year 1720, 
it was rebuilt out of the funds belonging to itfelf by the Ma- 
giftrates and Town-Council of Aberdeen from 1720 to 1724, 
and is at this day one of the neateft and bell fet down bridges 
to the river of any in Scotland.
