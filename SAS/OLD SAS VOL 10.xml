PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012502">WICK</name>. 

(County and Prejhytery of Calthnefs. — Synod of Caith. 
nefs and Sutherland. J 

By the Reverend Mr William Sutherland.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

fl iHE ancient and modern name of this parifh, as far as 
A can now be afcertained, is that of Wick t an appella- 
tion common all over the northern continent of Europe, 
fuppofed to fignify the fame with the Latin word vieus. t a 
village or fmall town, particularly when lying adjacent to a 
bay, or arm of the fea, refembling a wicket. When any 
other word is placed before or after it, that word denotes 
Vol. X. A fome 



8 Stati/lical Account 

fome peculiar property, for which the town or village is re. 

luarkabie. 

The parifh is 13 computed miles in length, and 7 in 
breadth. Its figure is al oft circular, though, in fome 
places, indented. The extent of the fea coaft is more than 
double the number of" miles, that the public road paffing in a 
direft line can meafure. The Ihorteft road to the ferries 
to the Orkney iflands, being evidently by Wick, and not by 
Thnrfo, a regulation took place, in 1 791, by which the 
courfe of the Orkney poft was altered, fo that it now goes by 
the former, inftead of the latter, town. 

Sea conjl, Rods, Caves, cjrV._- The coaft of this parifh con* 
fifts principally of high rocks, particularly along the line ex- 
tending from Clyth in Latheron parifh, towards Ulbfter, the 
property from which Sir John Sinclair derives his family 
title. Thefe rocks are prettily diverGfied by various creeks, 
$vhere fifhing boats can harbour *. The fiihermen, on this 

part 

* The names of the different creeks, (in the provincial dia- 
Jeft, goes,) are numberlefs. The?- fecm to be partly of Danifh, 
and partly of Enghfh derivation ; as Whalegoe, from whales 
having been caft a-fhore there, a circumltance that has happen- 
ed on different parts of this coaft — Reagoe, from a flimy mine- 
ral water dying the face of the roc k — Ravengoe, or the creek of 
ravens — Heathegoe. abounding with heath — Toitfvoe, or the fhel- 
ter of foxes, &amp;o There is alfo a rock near Ulblter called Lt- 
chan ore, a name which, according to tradition, it obtained from 
the following chcumftance : Gun of Clyth, a gentleman of 
Caithnefs, going over to Denmark, prevailed upon a Danifh 
Princefs to marry him. In returning home, to make preparations 
for the reception of the lady and her attendants, the vtifel, 
with the expected guefts, was wrecked upon this rock, and 
every foul perifhed. A pot full of gold, the remains of the 
wreck, having been found upon the rock, it hence obtained the 
Jjame of LiQiian ore, or golden flags, The body of the Princefs

part of the coaft, to get to their boats defcend a huge preci- 
pice by winding fteps in the face of the rock, by which 
fome lives have been loft ; and yet, from frequent practice, 
it is often done without affiftance, by a blind filherman in 
Ulbfter. To fecure their boats from being dafhed againft 
the rocks, particularly in ftorms and ftream tides, the fiiher- 
men hang up their yauls by ropes, on hooks fixed in the face 
of the rock, above the level of the water, where they are 
fafely fufpended, till the weather is fit for going to fea. Mr 
Brodie, tackfman of Ulbfter, has paid fome attention to the 
cleaning of thefe havens, and rendering the paflage eafier 
down the declivity. At one of thefe creeks (called Faligoe 
from the fall of water) is a fine cafcade, rufhing down a very 
high precipice, which, with the reflection of the fun, makes 
a very confpicuous appearance, from a confiderable diftance 
at fea. Underneath thefe rocks are many coves, extending 
up a confiderable way, and acceffible only by water in boats. 
In thofe hideous caverns, as vifitors advance, the light of 
the fun is gradually excluded, till at laft, they :ire involved 
in utter darknefs, and recourfe muft be had to torches, before 
they reach the ftrand. Along the (helving fides of the 
coves, many cormorants neftle and reft ; and the report of a 
gun fired in them refounds with a moft tremendous noife. 
In the feafon for feal catching, the fifhermen, as filently as 
poffible, land in boats at the head of the coves, on the beach, 
where they find numbers of feals, which they kill with blud- 
geons for their oil. In the egrefs from thefe coves, the gra- 
dual light of the fun is enjoyed with double fatisfaclion. The 

magnificence 

was thrown afbore, and interred in the neighbouring burying- 
ground at Ulbfter, where Sir John Sinclair's family romb is 
lituated, The fto&amp;e, which is laid to cover her grave, is rtiU 
extant; and has fome Hieroglyphick characters inscribed, 
though now much obliterated by time.

magnificence of the fceneis heightened by many rocky pyramid* 
of immenfe height, riling, at lome diftance, out of the fea. 
Curious petrefactions, f'ome of them meafuring from 2 to 3 
feet in length, are found in fome of thefe coves. On the 
eftate of Hempriggs in the mouth of a creek, one very re- 
markable rock forms a fmall ifland, about a gun fhot in 
length and 24 feet in width, covered with green, and open 
at the top, where fea fowls neftle ; it is fupported by two 
oblong pillars, completely interfered, fo widely, that a boat 
can eafily pafs through, and fo regularly, that it appears 
more like the work of art than of nature*. 

Old JVick.— Near this ifland is the caftle of Old Wick, 
built upon a narrow promontory : It is now a ruin, but forms 
a good beacon at fea, and is called by failors the Old Man 
of Wick. It feems to have been conftrucled for a place of 
refuge, having the ruins of a ditch and draw-bridge, a num- 
ber of port holes for defence, and a conveyance for retreat- 
ing, by a ftair defcending through the rock, to the fea. It 
was once the refidence of the Lords Oliphant (a dormant 
title,) one of whom is faid, in ancient times, to have been 
murdered, at a place not far diftant from his caftle. 

Salmon Fi/hing — On the eftate of Hempriggs, is a loch 
called the Salmon Craig, where the proprietor has a falmon 
filhing, which might be carried on more extenlively in the 
bay and river of Wick. The general opinion is, that this fi- 
fhery would be more productive were the courfe of the river 
altered, and carried in a ftraight line to the fea, which will be 
the cafe if the projected new harbour takes place. 

New 

* The rocks along the coafl: of this parifli abound with great 
variety of fea-fowl, efpecially marrots, fcarts, gulls, wild pi- 
geons &amp;c. affording a great deal of rockfliooting, the produce 
of which the fiikrmen, take up hi their boats, fait and eat in 
winter.

New Harkur.—^ new harbour is not only an object of the 
hioheft importance to the town itfclf and its immediate neigh- 
bourhood, but to the kingdom at large. It would be the means 
of faving many vcffels, which, when overtaken by ftorms or 
contrabands, have no place of (belter, between Cromarty 
and Stromnefs ; whence on this dangerous coaft, from the 
want of a harbour, many veffels have been driven afhore, and 
many lives loft. A harbour commodious tor a number of 
veffels, and fafe in all weather, might be made at Wick. This 
would be particularly beneficial during the herring fiihery, 
which has been much retarded from the want of fuch a (bel- 
ter. In 1 79 1, no lefs than 34 veffels lay there on the bounty, 
pent up in very narrow bounds, and in conftant danger of 
running foul of one another. The propofed plan for this har- 
bour however could not be executed without confiderable ex- 
pence. It was laid before the Britifh Fifhery Society, who 
fent perfons of (kill to take an exact furvey of the grounds, 
and to report their opinions, which was in favour of the mea- 
fure. A correfpondence has in confequence been entered into, 
with Benjamin Dunbar of Hempriggs, the proprietor, for feu- 
ing out, on the fouth fide of the water, oppofite to the town 
of Wick, feveral hundred acres of land, for building a fifh- 
ing village. The harbour at prefent, is very apt to be choak- 
ed up by banks of fand, thrown up at the mouth of the 
river, and which are only cleared away by flrong floods. 
There is another inconvenience often felt at this ' place, that 
veffels muft frequently wait both for a fair wind and a dream, 
tide, as they do not always an(wer at the fame time. Along 
the coaft near Wick, are a number of creeks, or goes, into 
which, during the herring fifhing feafon, fmall boats refort, 
which, at other times, are laid up in a -fine bafon, at a little 
diftance to the north, called the Broad-Haven of Wick. 



Staxigoe.—Nezr Wick is the creek of Staxigoe, deriving its 
name from a pyramidical rock, commonly called here a (tack, 

formed 



€ Statiftical Account 

formed in the mouth of the creek. Many veflels fefort thertf 
in lurnmer, but cannot ride there with fafety in winter. It i3 
a kind of port, where confiderable quantities of grain and meal, 
the produce of the neighbouring country, are (hipped off. 
Several perlons have commodious ftore houfes, and fome kilns 
for fmoaking herring have alfo been built there. Ground is 
feued out by Mr Dunbar, the proprietor, for dwelling houfes, 
at the rate of 10 s. per acre per annum for 99 years. 

Nofs-Head. — Near Caftle Sinclair, is a high rocky promon- 
tory called Nofs-Head, confpicuous fome miles off even in the 
middle of the country, and vifible at a vaft diftance at fea. 
If a beacon were erected here, and a light houfe at Duncanfby- 
head, feamen would have a good direction for regulating their 
courfe through the dangerous navigation of the Pentland 
Frith. Many accidents have happened by veflels fleering too 
near the land, in the dark, and proceeding right forward, fo 
as, inftead of entering the Firth, to involve themfelves among 
the breakers on the Sands of Keifs, where they are inevitably 
wrecked. 

Gajlks. — Clofe to each other are Caftles Sinclair and Gir- 
nigoe, formerly the refidence of ths Earls of Caithnefs. They 
are acceffible to the fea, and f~em to have been built with the 
iame view as the caftle of old Wick, though on a more ex- 
terifive plan. Not far from thefe venerable ruins is Acker- 
gill Tower, once the refidence of the Earls Marifchall, now 
the feat of Benjamin Dunbar of Hempriggs, the proprietor of 
a very confiderable eftate in the neighbourhood. In the Tower 
there is a large high vaulted hall, and another juft above it, 
now in difufe; the walls are of fuch breadth, that 12 or 14 
could conveniently fit at table in one of the windows. It is 
built clofe by the fea, and near it is an extenfive tract of green, 

called 



tf Wick.

called the links of Reifs and Wefter, with a good rabbit war- 
ren, affording a pleafant'ride, and an excellent road in all fea- 
fons ; though at ebb tide, a more expeditious courfe is taken 
by the fands, which extend about three miles. 

Keifs. — At Keifs in this parifh, one of the eftates of Sir 
John Sinclair, is an excellent manfion houfe, with an elegant 
ftair and cupola, built by Sir William Sinclair the former pro- 
prietor, but not completely finifhed. Below is a caftle where 
anciently the Earls of Caithnefs occafionally refided. This 
eftate as weU as the neighbouring of Nybfter, belonging to 
Mr Sinclair of Frefwick, abound with peat mofs. At Nybfter 
and Sarclett are finall falt-pans, where is made a weak kind 
of fait, that fells from i d. to 10 d. per peck. 

Sea ware. — Along that part of the coaft of this parifh 
where the beach is flat and level, the fea, particularly in 
winter and l'pring after a ftorm, throws in great quantities of 
fea-ware, which afford abundance of manure for the land. 
The ware is fometimes put into large heaps, and allowed to 
rot •, and then becomes a very ftrong manure, diffolving into 
a fat faponaceous fubftance, producing myriads of animalcu- 
la, and fometimes it is mixed up in dunghills, with cods-heads, 
herring garbage, and brine. It is cut at ebb tide with corn 
hooks from the ftones, and burnt into kelp. — As about half 
the coaft of this parifh is fteep and rocky, the quantity of 
kelp made in it is not confiderable, not exceeding, at an 
average, from 40 to 50 tons. 

Fifberies. — The fifheries along the fhore of this parifh, 
form an objeft of confidernble importance. The coaft is of 
great extent, and abounds with a vaft variety of fifh, which, 
fcefides what is annually exported, furnifh.es the inhabitants

with a liberal fupply during every Irafon of the year. Sal- 
mon, from, herring, cod, ling, haddock, whiting, mackarel, 
halibut, which the fifhers here call turbot, Ikatc, flounder, 
dog-fiih, (from whofe livers a great quantity of oil is extrac- 
ted) a red tpeckled prickly fifh called cumars, cuddies, that 
grow up to the lize of a cod, and are then called fcaths, fillocks, 
a fmall filh caught with the rod from the rocks in fuch quanti- 
ties, as to be fold for a penny an Hundred, are all met with in 
plenty ; land eels, crabs, partans, and lobfttrs are alfo caught 
here, though the latter not to fuch extent as might be for 
the London market, to which it is now in agitation to fend 
them.— Many years ago, the cod fifliing was carried on to a 
conliderable extort on rhis coaft; but, from the inattention 
or uiilkntulneis ot the lifhermen, had for fome time been 
given up, except merely for the fupply of the inhabitants; 
till of late it was refumed by the Meflrs Falls of Dunbar, 
who entered into contracts with the fifliermen, not only of 
this place, but all along the coaft of Caithnefs, for what fifh 
they could take. — Thele contracts have been afligned to 
Meflrs Selby, Creflwell, and Co. London, who now carry on 
the fifhery to a conliderable extent. — The fifhermen receive 
quarterly the price of the fifh they deliver, at the rate of 
2d. for every cod, not below 12 inches in length. Small as 
the price is, yet, as it enfures a market, it enables the fifher- 
men, who are moftly farmers, to pay their rents much better 
than before. 

A boil-houfe is erected at Wick for pickling the falmon

ing each about 40 lb. of falmon, are annually fent to Lon-

An ice houfe has alfo been built here, to fupply ice for 
carrying fifh to London, but the two laft winters being mild, 
little or no ice could be got ; the plan, however, is by no 
* means given up. 

Herring FiJJjery. — From time immemorial great fhoals of 
herrings have vifited this coaft ; till of late years, however, 
they were much neglected, the people contenting them- 
felves, year after year, with catching a few on hooks ; and 
proceeding with that excellent bait to the cod-fifhing. But 
in 1767 and 1768, a more enterpriling fpirit arofe. John 
Sutherland of Wefter, Meflrs John Anderfon of Wick, 
and Alexander Miller of Staxigoe, fitted out two floops 
on the bounty. 1 hey proceeded to Shetland, then the 
neareft place of rendezvous, where they were entered on the 
Cuftom-houfe books ; returning to the coaft of Caithness, 
they filhed fuccefsfully, but, owing to fome informality, were 
deprived of the bounty, then amounting to 50 s. per ton. 
This difappointment, however, did not deter them from 
making another trial next year, though on a leffer fcale. 
They fitted out only one floop, and had the fame luccefs ; 
but it was with fome difficulty that the bounty was recover- 
ed. The adventure, on the whole, not being very encou- 
raging, their ardour was abated for fome years, but the pi ice 
of rendezvous being at laft altered, the herring filhery yearly 
iocreaied; a fpirit of emulation arofe between the natives of 
the town and feveral adventurers, who, on account of the 
fifhery, reforted to Wick from other places. Curing of red, 
as well as white, herrings became an objedt of attention ;

and both the red and white herring' of Wick have met with 
the higheft approbation in the London and other markets. 

The fuccefs of the herring fifhing has been various, but, 
on the whole, increafing in proportion to the number of ad- 
venturers, and the fkill they acquire*. In 1 790, 32 vclTels 
on the bounty, meafuring 1610 tons, lay at Wick, but were 
greatly hampered for want of a good harbour. In 1791, 
the number amounted to 44, crammed clofe to one another, 
in a worfe condition than ever. They were much damaged 
by a ftorm in the height of the fifhing feafon, notwithftand- 
ing which, the quantity caught was reckoned not inferior to 
that of 1790; and was lufficient to load all the bounty vef- 
fels. Many more might have been caught, had there been a 
good harbour for the veffels : At prefent boats only can be 
made uie of ; and it is an agreeable fight, in a fine evening, 
to fee upwards of 200 of them at once under fail, the/ 
crews in high fpirits, fetting out for the fifhing ; it would, 
however, be ft ill more pleafing to fee as many large veffels 
bulled in the fame occupation, which might be the cafe 
were the harbour made more commodious. Notwithftand- 
ing the fuccefs of late years, the fifheries of Wick are as yet 
in their infancy. Before they can fiourifh, fo as to become 
a national object, different encouragements would be necef- 
fary. A good harbour is much wanted, as nothing of the 
kind can be found on all the eaft coaft of Caithnefs ; a cir- 
cumftance that has occafioned much damage, as well as lofs

of lives, even during the herring fifhing feafon, which at this 
place is in fummer and the beginning of autumn. The 
coaft being very open and dangerous, fifhermen will not ven- 
ture out in fmall boats but in very promifing weather. The 
abolition of the duty on coals would be of great ufe by en- 
couraging the refort of fettlers to carry on both fifheries and 
manufactures ; and laftly, it would be of importance to have 
a large fupply of fait and calks laid up in ftorehoufes*. 

It would alfo contribute to the fuccefs of the herring fi- 
fhery were proper regulations laid down for carrying it on. 
Real fifhermen, whofe fole bufinefs and intereft fhould be 
to carry on all forts of fi/hing, ought to be procured. Al- 
though this parifh affords as good a fifhing coaft and as good 
ftations as could be wifhed, yet it is to be regretted that 
there are hardly any real bihermen belonging to it, thofe 
alone excepted who refort to Wick, from different parts of 
the kingdom, during the feafon of herring fifhing only. 
Such, however, is the defire of gain that pervades all fort s of 
tradefuien here, that they betake themfeives to the herring 
fifhing when they think it likeiy to turn to better account

caught in one night here; but, from its uncertainty, private ad- 
venturers cannot afford to have by them fo gfeat a Hock of fait 
and cafks, as would be neceifary on fuch occafions ; the confe- 
rence is, that when the herrings run beyond expectation, the 
private flocks are exhauiled, the induiiry of the poor fifherman 
cramped, and the fifli allowed to lie on their hands, though per- 
haps the merchants were bound by paction to receive them. 
The bell remedy would be to take off entirely the duty upon

previous preparation, repair to the fifoing boats, go to fea in 
the night, the only time for catching herrings, and f'pend all 
the day in fltep, by which their cuftomers are fure to be ill 
ferved. Hufb.ind.nen, and even fmall farmers, hire themlcl- 
ves out, during the fifhing feafon, for 8 d. iod. or i s. per 
night and, during the ourfe of about three months, mafters 
are at a conliderable iofs For iervants to carry on the bufinefs 
of their farms. Thefe people feldom return till the harveft 
begins, thereby earning double wages for the fummer feafon. 

It is an unfortunate tircumflance for the fifheries that the 
method of growing and manufacturing hemp is not known 
in this neighbourhood, where there is fo much need of cord- 
rig" and netting. At prefent, the fifhermen muft buy foreign 
hemp, from the merchants of Wick, when they might raife 
it at ho ne as good and much cheaper. To encourage this, 
the truflees ought to allow higher premiums for railing hemp 
than flnx ; nr prefent they are on the fame footing. There is 
not a doubt that hemp would thrive here, there being plenty 
of excellent manure, and abundance of fine rich black loamy 
foil. 

Appearance of the Country — The appearance of the country, 
in general, is flat, open, and champaign. Very confiderable 
improvements might be introduced into Caithnefs, which, it 
is to be hoped, will in time take place. Through all that 
county immenfe tracts of uncultivated green ground, with a 
good depth of foil, and ready for the plough, lie in a. ftate of 
nature, and are made u(e of only as common pafture, but 
might e.ifilv be converted into good arable land. There are 
alfo ftill larger tracts of heath, all of which might be brought 
in, and, if cultivated, would foon render the county capa- 
ble of yielding double the prefent rent, and more than double 



of Wick, 

the prefent productions. In moft farms, likewife, there Is a 
great deal of outfield ground, which, after being kept for 4 or 
5 years in oats, is only fuffered to lie by for 2 or 3 years, and 
never receives any manure, nor is properly laid down with 
grafs feeds. Such, however, on the whole, is the natural fer- 
tility of this county, that with a very indifferent fyffem of 
hufbandry, it is able to export, in tolerable years, no lefs than 
from 18000 to 24000 bolls of bear and meal, befides fupply. 
ing the confumption of its own inhabitants. Wheat, rye, pcafe, 
and green crops are very little in ufe. Rye is almoft never 
fown *. 

Climate. — The climate is healthy, unlefs in very rainy fea- 
fons, when the air is impregna d with damps, perhaps great- 
er than in the more fouthern counties of Scotland ; and when 
the moift weather is of long continuance whole families are 
infected with nervous fevers, diarrhoea, and dyfentery. It is 
a general remark that Caithnefs fuffers much lefs from dry 
than from rainy feafons, for moft of the lands in that county ly- 
ing on rock, the rain is prevented from penetrating very deep ; 
and the rock being cov red by a ftratum of clay, the foil re- 
tains a fufficicnt degree of moifture for vegetation. But, when 
the feaion happens to be excefiivtly wet, the effect muft be 
the reverie ; the foil is chilled, and a late crop is generally 
the confequence. Snow does not remain here fo long as in 
the fouth, from the country being expofed to the influence of 
the German Ocean. On the coaft, the weather is fometimes 
mild and foft when there is frofl in the interior parts, fo that

* As a proof of the richnefs of the foil here, it may be ob- 
ferved, that there are many fields, which, in the memory of 
man, have never been fpwn with any thing but bear ; with only 
a fprinkling of manure each year, fometimes but once in two 
years, yet have always yielded as abundant a crop as the ground 
could carry.

mill a diftiilet y a fnuff mill, a lint-mill, and three corn-mills. 
There is another loch, curioufly fituatcd on the top of a hill, 
which, notwithftanding, never overflows its banks. The loch 
of Wef er, communicating w ; th the fea, produces plenty of 
excellen* fidmon-trout, fomeof them two feet in length, remark- 
able for flavour, delicacy, and richnefs. Hifherro they havs 
been caught only for the ufe of the neighbourhood; but might 
become a valuable article of commerce, if their excellence was 
known to the luxurious citizens of London. In March and 
April, all thefe lakes are periodically vifited by fwans, that 
refort to them for a temporary refting place : In their paflage 
to the north, they wait here till all their companions are af- 
fembled, when, on the approach of good weather, they pair 
and fly off" in troops to the Orkney ifla ids and other places, 
in which they breed ; they return again with their y ung to 
the Caithnefs lakes, about the month of October. Their mu- 
fic, at a difta.ice, in a calm night, when fitting together as it

pleafing effect *. It is faid, that, when young, they are de-

Minerals. — Near the caftle of Old Wick, in the face of a 
rock, a copper mine was difcovered ; and rrom the appearance 
of the ore, fome miners entered into a contract with the pro. 
prietor, and had begun to work it, but the fcheme was drop- 
ped, for reafons which are not at prefent known. Here, ab in 
fome other parts of the parifh, there are inexhaustible itores 
of limeftone. At Old Wick, the lime has been burnt by Mr 
Dunbar of Hempriggs and his predecefTors, at from y d. to 
Tod. pet boll. The quarry there is interlarded with flags ufe- 
ful for paving *. The county abounds with {tones, very fit for 
building, which might be much mure employed than they are 
at prefent for drains and inclofures, the want of wh:ch great- 
ly retards the progrefs of improvement. Some fmall ttones 
have been found, which feem to be a fpecies of flint, about 
an inch long and half an inch broad, of a triangular fhape, 
and barbed on each fide. The common people confidently af- 
fert, that they are fairies arrows, which they fhoot at cattle, 
when they inftantly fall down dead, though the hide of the 
animal remains quite entire. Some of thofe arrows have been 
found buried a foot under ground, and are fuppofed to have 
been in antient times fixed in fhafts, and (hot from bows. 
Some (tones alfo of a flinty nature have been found, which 
when broken contained the fhape of ferpents coiled round in 
the heart of the ftone.

tion, appears to be incrcafing. On the moft confiderable eftate 
in it, that of Hempriggs, as well as on feveral others, there are 
many well cultivated fields let to tenants, which about a cen- 
tary ago were no better than common pafture. The inhabi- 
tants, particularly on the coaft and in the burgh of Wick, have 
multiplied as the fifheries have become more extended and 
fuccefsfui. In February 1719, when Mr James Oliphant ob- 
tained a decreet for ftipend. the inhabitants of the parifh were 
reckoned to amount to about 4000 fouls. The return to Dr 
Webfter in 1755 was 3938, and the number has fince increas- 
ed to at leaft 5000 young and old. It is alio reafonable to im- 
agine that the population will be confiderably augmented in 
confequence of villages projected on the fouth and north of 
the town ; the one by the Britifh Fifhing Society already allu- 
ded to ; and the other now building by tenants of Mr Dun- 
bar of Hempriggs, who, in terms of the adt for encouraging 
agriculture on entailed lands, have taken 99 years leafes of 
33 acres of excellent land, fit for garden ground, at the rate 
of 22 s. per acre. Thefe tenants are bound, on each half 
acre, to build a houfe worth at leaft 10 pounds. This village 
is called Louifburgh, in compliment to Mrs Dunbar, whofe 
chriftian name is Louila, and it can fcarcely fail to profper 
from the many advantages which it pofTefTes. 

The number of families in the burgh of Wick is about 
200, and the number of inhabitants about 1000. The num- 
ber of Births in the parifh, at an average of 3 years, may a- 
mount to about 120 per annum. Marriages, communibus annis y 
run from 27 to 30, but fome omit to record either births or 
marriages. — The deaths are not recorded, becaufe, in this po- 
pulous and very extenfive parifh, there are no lefs than fe- 
ven different burial places, befides the principal one within

are rare, but many exceed 80, and a few arrive at 90 years 
of age. 

Occupations. — There are few handicraftfmen in the coun- 
try part of the parifh, which is principally inhabited by far- 
mers. The leafes of thefe farmers are commonly of fhort du-? 
ration, and they are bound to perform heavy and almoft un- 
limited fervices to the landlord. Thefe fervices are, in gene- 
ral, as follows ; viz. in fpring, ploughing, harrowing, and 
manuring; in fumrner, weeding corns, cutting, winnowing, 
leading, and ftacking hay ; thatching office-houfes with the 
tenants own turf, ftraw, and Amnions ; cutting and leading 
midding feals, &amp;c. ; in harveft the farmer muft, if a fair day 
offer, affift when called out in cutting down his landlord's 
(or as here termed his majiers) crop, though he leave his 
own entirely neglected, and expofed to bad weather ; he 
muft afterwards lead and ftack it in the corn yard, and, at 
fome interval, muft rebuild the ftacks, furn idling them with 
ftraw and Amnions of his own ; in winter, fome tenants 
threfh part of the matter's crop, giving him what is called 
cuftom ftraw, befides wintering his cattle, and furnifliing 
ropes for the ploughs and for binding the cattle. Tenants have, 
moreover, to take their mafter's victual, kiln-dry, mill, and 
fift it, and deliver in meal at a proof ; and when it is fold to 
a merchant, they are obliged to carry it, as well as their own 
victual rent, to the neighbouring port and put it on £h"p 
board, their horfes often ftanding all the time, for many hour.;, 
ftarving with cold and hunger. The tenants muft a!fo in ro- 
tation be obedient at a call to carry letters from their raafter 
to any part of the county. Thefe oppreffive and impolitic 
fervices are here very properly called mnjhr-icork, but they 
are rapidly wearing out ; and it is to be hoped will foon be 
entirely abohflied: Already, indeed, fome gentlemen have 
converted the fervices of their tenants, and given them leafes

for nineteen years. That abject fervitude, formerly fo pre- 
valent, was evidently contrary to honelt induftry and real im- 
provement. While fuch a fyftem preyailed, it was much 
againft the intereft of a good hufbandman to improve his 
farm, as if he did another offered a higher rent or graffum 
for it, and reaped the fruit of his labours and exertion. 

Rents. — The tenants pay their rents partly in money and 
partly in kind, as in grain, lambs, cocks, hens, chickens, 
eggs, &amp;c. Proprietors, whofe tenants go to the fifliing, 
generally get a fmall prefent of fifh on their coming from 
fea, fince what was called katerfifh has been abolifhed. The 
old iniquitous feudal practice, by which the landlord thought 
himfelf entitled to take the heriel horfe from a poor widow, 
on the death of ht'r hufband, is now unknown. The rent 
of the beft arable land here is from ios. 6 d. to 15 s. per 
acre. In addition to the ufual rent, fines, or what is here 
called boads, graffuins, or entry money, are fometimes ex- 
acted. — There are only 9 heritors in the parifh, the great- 
er proportion of whom are non-refident. 

Tack/men.— There are about feven principal tackfmen, or 
great farmers, in the parilh, who hold leafes of the proprie- 
tors at ftipulated ren^, and who exact from the fubtenants 
and cotters the rents and iervices that would otherwife bz 
payable to the proprietors. But fometimes the landlord, in- 
ftead of letting his eftate to a tackfman, keeps it in his own 
hands, and manages a part of it, called the Mains, by an over- 
feer and fervants, with the afliltance of the tenants and cot- 
ters*.

about 12 fhopkeepers, 9 or 10 fhipmafters, 50 coopers, in-

&amp;c. fufficient for the fize of the place. The greater part of 
thefe tradefmen are occalionally employed as fifhermen. 

Religious perfuafions. — Of late, fome feceders (antiburgher^) 
have made their appearance, but they are much on the de- 
cline, and have at prefent no fettled minifter. There is but 
one ftated preacher of that perfuafion at prefent in the coun- 
ty, who is fettled at Thurfo. The parifhioners, in general, 
are of the eftabli(hed church of Scotland, of good, moderare, 
and peaceable dhpofitions, not ignorant of the principles, nor 
inattentive to the practice, of religion. — There are Hill about 
half a dozen Anabaptifts on the eftnte of Keifs, the remains 
of the difciples of the late Sir William Sinclair, who was 
himfelf a zealous Anabaptift, and made fome profelytes a- 
mongft his tenants. But this fmall exception to the gene- 
ral perfuafion of the people is fcarcely worth notice. 

Stipend. — The prefent living of the minifter of Wick is 
97 1. 13 s. 4d. Sterling, the vicarage tiend being converted 
at 200 1. Scotch, and the victual at 8 1. Scotch per boll, 
for which the Lords of Seffion pronounced decreet in 177c. 
There is a good manfe and offices built in 1786, a garden 
with a glebe and fome inclofures and improvements. The 
glebe was exchanged for a fufficient equivalent on Mr Dun- 
bar's eftate, and an adequate confideration was given for the 
garden ground, corn yard, and ftance or fite of the old manfe 
and offices. The prefent church is very old, a long, dark,

parifli was acquired from the late General Scott by Sir Wil- 
liam Dunbar of Hempriggs. 

Poor. — The funds appropriated for the fupport of the 
poor in the parifli arife principally from the public collec- 
tions in the church, which, deducting bad copper, do not 
exceed from 10I. to 12L per annum, confequently, at an 
average, it is fcarcely two millings to each pcnfioner, there be- 
ing no lefs than 150 on the parifli roll. The fmallnefs of 
thofe funds is owing to the abfence of the gentry, who fpend 
their rents elfewhere, and leave the poor on their feveral 
eftates to be chiefly fupplied by the inhabitants of the burgh. 
In fuch cafes it were much to be wifhed, that either the 
heritors by themfelves or agents would afTefs themfelves, as 
is done in other parifhes in Scotland, or that a law were ob- 
tained obliging them annually to pay a certain fum for the 
relief of the poor. The mulcts are applied towards payment 
of the fees of the feflion clerk or parochial officers, &amp;c. If 
a balance remains, it is diftributed among the poor. 

Schools. — Befides the parochial fchool, there are no lefs 
than five charity fchools with eftablilhed falaries in the pa- 
rifli, and alfo feveraf private teachers. Mr William Hallo- 
Wall, who, about forty years ago, was an itinerant minifter in 
this parifli, and afterwards chaplain to the Charity Work- 
houfe at Edinburgh where he died, bequeathed 21 1. for ever 
to the parifli of Wick, for endowing three charity fchools, to- 
be built and upheld by the heritors on whofe ground they 
were erected. Their falaries, on the application of the mini- 
fter to the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, 
were fomewhat augmented. There are, befides, two other 
fchools which the Society were pleafed to fettle; one of them 
is eftabliflied in the town of Wick, for teaching through the 
week, and a catechetical exercife on Sunday. It is fupport-

ed partly by the before mentioned Society, partly by the So- 
ciety for Promoting Religious Knowledge, among the poor, 
and partly by the contributions of the town and parifh. 
The teacher is accommodated with a fcho'ol and dwelling 
houfe in the town by Sir John Sinclair, the heritable Provoft. 
This eftablifhment was greatly owing to the worthy Secre- 
tary to the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, 
(the Reverend Mr Kemp of Edinburgh,) who, in the courfe 
of his furvey of the fchools in the northern parts of Scot- 
land, faw the great utility that might be derived from fuels 
an inftitution *. 

Productions. — Neither in this parifli, nor in any part of the 
country, are trees abundant, nor do they feem in general to 
thrive in it. On the coaft, where they are expofed to the 
fea blaft, every attempt to raife wood has proved abortive. 
But in the more interior parts, and remote from the fea, trees 
anfwer better. It is, however, remarkable, that, in ancient 
times, wood appears to have grown well ; for in many mofs 
grounds, large logs have been, and are to this day, dug up. 
In regard to gardens, Caithnefs is no fruit country, at leaft 
for apricots, peaches, or the finer forts of fruit. Common 
apples and pears, however, together with cherries, fixaw- 
berries, and currants, anfwer well when properly attended to j 
cucumbers are raifed in hot beds ; artichokes are found here 
in the greateft perfection ; collyflowers, cabbages, colewort,

Cattle.— The county at large, as well as this parifh in par- 
ticular, abounds with black cattle ; confiderable numbers of 
which young and old are purchafed by drovers at from 4c s. 
to 50 s. per head, and are driven to Falkirk, Edinburgh, and 
England. It is here afferted, that the more or lowland, 
drive fully as well as the highland, cattle. Horfe coupers or 
dealers buy up in futnmer all the year-old garron ftags or 
colts they can find, which they fend over to Orkney; and fell 
with profit. Thefe the Orkney men, after keeping and 
working for 3 or 4 years, refell when full grown, perhaps 
at double the price, according to their age and appearance; 
fo that when they are brought back to Caithnefs, the farmer 
muft give fuch a price for them that he pays for their keep- 
ing in Orkney, more than they would have coft had they re- 
mained in Caithnefs. Thefe horfes, called here garrons, are a 
fmall breed, between 4 and 44. feet high, very hardy, re- 
quiring little care, and living in winter on fodder with little 
or no corn. 

Ploughs. — Four of thofe garrons, * or fometimes four 
oxen, are yoked in a plough a-breaft, and not two and two 
in the long draught as in other places. So much attached 
are farmers here, and even the farm fervants of gentlemen, to 
this cuftom, that they will by no means alter their method ; 
alleging, that, in a fhort yoke, they can eafier raife the 
plough over rocky land, do more work, and draw with more 
advantage, particularly when the ridges are crooked, than in 
the long way. This aukward method cannot be approved of 
by good judges. The fhort draught or four a-breaft is never 

equal, 

* Horfes of a larger fize than the garron, if fit for the car- 
riage or the faddle, are called here court korfes.

equal, but the one end of the long beam or firft bar always 
goes before the other, juft as the driver whips up the cattle 
on his right or on his left hand. The driver is in the 
middle, and walks backwards all the way, keeping his face 
towards the ploughman ; whereby, indeed, he has it in his 
power to give more or lefs earth to the plough, by pufhing off 
the two horfes, on which he leans his hands, to either fide. 
This abfurd method is ftill praclifed by all, except fuch 
gentlemen as have got Jouth country iervants, who are be- 
ginoing to ufe two horfes in a plough without a driver. 

In this county fome years ago, and ftill it is faid in Ork- 
ney, a fort of plough yet more lingular was uled. It had but 
one ftilt, called the iteering tree ; this the ploughman held 
dole to his right thigh, which was covered with a fheeps 
lkin to fave his clothes ; the coulter was not, as now, through 
the beam, but through the key, which was made very ftrong. 
This plough is faid to have pulverifed the foil much, and to 
have produced good crops, but was weighty in the draught. 
The number of ploughs in this parifh cannot be lefs than 
5 80, a fufficient proof of the great value and extent of the 
arable part of the parifh. 

Carts.- — The ufe of carts has been only of late years intro- 
duced into this country ; and they are as yet far from being 
fo generally ufed, as every good farmer would wilh. The 
tenants carry home their peats, and fome lead their corn, in 
what they call crubans. They carry their vicinal in ftraw 
creels called capes, made very compaftly of long oat ftraw 
woven with fmall twifted ropes of rufiies, and fixed over 
ftraw flets on the horfes backs with a clubber and ftraw 
ropes — When a call comes to fhip the matter's victual, fome 
fcores of the garrons or fmall horfes above defcribed are 
fent out by the tenants, tied to one another by the tail, with 
a caffie of meal or bear on either fide of every horfe. A 

boll

Stati/lical Account 



boll of meal or half a boll of bear is all the load each can 
carry in this mifcrable mode of conveyance. 

Sheep. — Different attempts have been made to rear fheep 
in this parifh, but not with fuccefs. They are liable to fo 
many difeafes, with the cure of which the farmers here are 
totally unacquainted, that they are generally fwept off once 
every five or feven years; and, in rainy feafons, whole (beep 
cotts have been quite extirpated. This ciifcourages farmers 
from rearing fo many as otherwife they mi^ht do, in fuch 
extenfiye commons as are to be met with every where hi 
this county. As a fheep walk, the beft place in this parifh, 
is no doubt the hills of Yarrow, a part of Sir John Sinclair's 
eftate, where they might have a range of dry hills, plenty of 
heath with a mixture of grafs, &amp;c. But at prefent, a very 
prepofterous method is prachfed by the tenants in that 
neighbourhood, as well as all over Caithnefs, of penning up 
their fheep in houfes in fummer, (to keep them from their 
corn,) whilft in the winter feafon, they are allowed to ftray 
at large to the fhore, where they live partly on fea ware. 
Many of thefe neglected but valuable animals are killed by 
foxes, and many are found lying dead on the fhore drowned 
by the fea. The breed of fheep here are fraall bodied, with 
tolerable wool, and make excellent mutton when fattened at 
-a proper age. 

Flax. Flax thrives well here, and moft of the farmers 

fow as much as is neceflary for the ufe of their families. It 
has not, however, as yet been carried on to fuch an extent 
as to procure any premiums from the truftees. Watering 
it, is found to be a very precarious and troublefome proceis, 
requiring a conftant regular attention ; and taking up much 
of a farmer's time from other work. The feed is faldom or 

never 



of WkL 25 

never preferved here. — The experiment of boiling the flax, 
inftead of watering it, feemed to anfwer in this pariih. 

Fuel. — As to fuel, fome parts of the parifh abound with 
mofs grounds, which furnifh the contiguous farmers with 
plenty of peats. Other places, particularly the town of Wick, 
lie two or three miles diftant from mofs. Providing this 
article of peats takes up the farmer during the greater part 
of the funitner leafon, and, in bad years, a part of the harveffc 
alfo j and yet in a wet feafon, many are very ill fupplied. 
This mode of getting fuel proves very hurtful to hufbandry, 
as a farmer could much more profitably employ his carts in 
making dunghills for his lands ; a garron load of peats on 
crubans is fold in Wick, at a penny. Each horfe carries on- 
ly about ten or twelve peats. Ten or twelve of thefe loads 
will fcarcely fill an ordinary cart. To the poor tenant mak- 
ing peats is an unprofitable occupation, and to the buyer 
they are undoubtedly dear. The burgh is fo fenfible of this 
inconvenience, that they and the neighbourhood are coming 
more and more into the practice of burning coals. But 
Caithnefs and the other northern counties labour under a 
grievous burden, that moft unreasonable duty on coals water- 
born, which, however, there is now a profpect of loon being 
freed from. 

Crops. — Very little land is here employed in railing artifi- 
cial or fown grafies, but there is a good deal of common 
meadow grafs. Mr Dunbar of Hempriggs has from 12 to 
14 acres under clover and rye-grafs, though winter herding 
has not yet been fully eftablifhed. There are a few acres of 
fown grafs in the open fields between Wick and Scaxigoe, 
and about eight acres more in the pofTeflion or the minifter. 
Few deal in green crops. A fmall quantity of turnips may

be Town in fome places, but potatoes are cultivated by all. 
Probably if the practice of green crops became general, it 
would be more beneficial than the ordinary rotation of bear 
and oats alternately, which is the praftice of Caithnefs. 
Two thirds of the arable land is generally fown with a mix- 
ture of black and grey oats, which is found to anfwer better, 
and to yield more plentiful returns, than white oats. March 
and April is the ufual feed time for oats, but fometimes they 
are fown fo late as the b-ginning of May. The other part 
of the land is laid down in bear, the earlieft about the be- 
ginning of May, and continuing till the middle of June. 
In fome places, this article has been fown as late as the 18th 
or 20th of June, and yet has produced a plentiful crop, 
though of inferior quality. In warm lying places, bear has 
been known to be in the ground only about ten weeks from 
the fowing to the reaping time ; a proof of very quick vege- 
tation. 

Run-r)g — A pernicious cuftom ftill too much prevails in 
this and other places, of pofiefllng land in what is called rig 
and retinal, or run-rig, that is to fay, each tenant, in a particu- 
lar farm or diftrict, has a ridge alternately with his neighbours. 
This is neceffarily attended with confufion and difputes, and 
is a practice requiring to be abolifhed. It is thought to have 
taken place in times of barbarity, as a preferyative againfi: 
• one neighbour fetting fire to the field of another, if inimically 
diipofed, and to make them all equally anxious to refift the 
enemy, in cafe of invafion *.

are ftill extant. At Thrumfier there is a ruin of one, fur-

Saint Erefkirk, a little below Ackergill Tower, refpe&amp;ing

In cheap years, beef has been fold at 1 d. or 1 1 d per lib. ; but 
when cattle is dear, and the demand high, it has got up to 2d. 
and z\ d. and in fpring, when fcarceft, to 3 d. Pork and mutton 
fetch much the fame price. The meat here is fuppofed to be 
more tender and delicious, than the rougher grained animal food 
of England, or that of thefouthern parts of Scotland. Caithnefs 
is noted for rearing geefe, which furniih a luxurious repaft, when 
fattenned on the Itubbles after harveft. Sometimes they are 
hung up and fmoaked. Some turkeys and ducks are raifed. Hens 
fetch from 3d. to 4d. cocks 2 1 d. chickens 1 d. and i±d. each, 
and eggs fell atjid. per dozen. Of meal and bear, there is in gene- 
ral not only a fuperabundance, but a confiderable export. There 
is enough of malt, and too much whifkey, which is prejudicial 
to the morals and conftitutions of many. Butter and cheeft; are 
fold at from 10s. to 12 s. per double ftone of 24 lib weight. 
Tallow at much the fame rate. The difference to the prices of 
provifions of all kinds, is very confiderable in the courfe of the 
laft 20, 30, or 40 years ; a leg of beef, weighing between 50 or 
60 lib. could have been bought for 2 s 6d. 3 s. or 4 s. which 
now will fetch from 10s. to 18 s. according to the weight and 
quality ; and pork, mutton, and veal, have rifen in the fame 
proportion. Geefe that of old fold at 4d. 6 d. and 8 d. now 
draw 1 s. in fummer, is. 3d. after harveft, and is. 6 d. at Mar- 
tinmas. Tallow, butter, and cheefe that formerly fold at 4 1. or 
5 1. Scotch, the double ftone, now fetch from 14I. to 15 1. and 
16 1. Scotch. In like manner, victual, that 30 years ago fold at 
5 s. 6 s. 7 s. or 8 s. now fetches from 10 s. (the ufuaJ convert- 
ed price of the boll in Caithntfs,) to 12 s 14s 15s. 16s. 18s. 
and for crop 1782, which had in general failed, no lefs than 20 s!

fying, that in fairnefs a very ftrong man ought to have more

ftratagem of mounting two men on each horfe ; by which 
means the Guns were overpowered by fuperior numbers, and 
were obliged to fly for fancluary to Saint Ere's chapel, where 
many of them were put to death. The moft remarkable battle 
or Jkirmifh, that is known to have been fought in this parifli, 
was at a place called Auldnamarlich near Wick, on the north 
fide of the river. This engagement happened in July 1680, 
between George Sinclair, fon of the Honourable Francis Sin- 
clair, of Nprthfield and Kiefs, claiming the title of Earl of 
Caithnefs, on the one part, and on the other the Earl of 
Breadalbane, who, affifted by a military force, obtained the 
victory.

CharaBer of the People — This parifh, and the county in ge* 
neral, is juftly characterized for its martial fpirit. It has pro- 
ved an excellent nurfery for foldiers and failors. No where 
have recruiting officers been more fuccefsful. Want of ma- 
nufactures and other means of employment, make young men, 
who are averfe fo labour in hufbandry, and have no good way 
of livelihood, readily betake themfelves to the army and navy, 
more efpecially when a Highland corps is to be raifed. On 
the late alarm of a Spanifh war, the town of Wick chearfully 
furnifhed its quota of feamen, and of courfe procured protec- 
tions for thofe employed in die fifheries *.

before put up with a kelt coat, (a kind of coarfe flannel dyed 
black) the houfevvifes own manufacture, common fluff gowns 
for the women, are not now fatisfied without good Englifli cloth, 
muflin gowns, white ftockings, filk ribbands, &amp;c particularly 
at fairs, weddings, and other public appearances. Bonnets have 
very much given way to hats ; and ihoemakers get from 4s. to 
6 s. for fhoes, from fervants, who, not 20 years ago, had an 
allowance of only 1 s. for fhoes, whilft women employed in hus- 
bandry were allowed but 8 d. This turn for drefs, and the many 
fairs or markets held in the county, (which being called after 
fome faint, as the Marymafs, Fergufmafs, Magnufmafs, Peterf- 
mafh, 3cc, feem to be the remains of holy days obferved in Ro- 
man Catholic times), * draw fervants away from a proper at- 
tention to their own bufinefs, and make them very unprofitable 
afllftants to the farmer. In regard to amufements, they are ex- 
travagantly fond of dancing in Caithnefs, efpecially about the 
time of Chriflmas and the new year, when almoft every town, or 
village, keeps a day in honour of the tutelar faint of the place, 
and devotes it to mirth md jollity.

tion of George Earl of Caithnefs, a charter was granted by 
King James VI. of Scotland, of date the 24th September 
1589, erecting the town of Wick into a royal borough. On 
the 8th October 1672, his great grandfon, another George 
Earl of Caithnefs, difponed the whole Earldom of Caithnels, 
including the lands and tenements of the town of Wick, to 
John Campbell of Glenorchy, afterwards created Earl of 
Breadalbane 5 by whofe fucceflbr in title it was fold in 17 18, 
to the family of Sinclair of Ulblter. On a general order from 
the convention of Royal Burghs, the fet or government of 
the borough of Wick, was ultimately fixed in 1716, by which, 
in all time coming, the content of the original founders of 
the borough, and their fucceffbrs, was declared to be necef- 
fary to the election of magistrates. By this fet, thp old ma- 
gistrates make out a leet, confifting of two out of which a 
Provoft, four out of which two bailies are to be chofen, by 
the burgefTes on the roll, and the leet muft be prefented 
30 days before Michaelmafs, to be aproved of by the Supe- 
rior. The Provoft ami the two bailies thus elected, have the 
right of chufing feven councillors, a treafurer, and dean of 
guild. In confequence of thefe regulations, Sir John Sinclair 
of Ulbfter, and his predeceflors, have annually been in the 
practice, of approving a leet, prefented to them, of the ma- 
gistrates to be chofen. Wick is one of five burghs each of 
whom chufes a delegate for returning a member to Parlia. 
ment for the northern diftrict. The income or common 
good of the town is very trifling, but it is on the increafe, and 
ariSes from the Cuftoms payable on different articles fold at

pend, nor School mafter's Salary, nor has it any real property 
in the church. Its tolbooth is Seldom occupied by prifoners, 
except for petty riots ; and a very few for civil debts.

Mtfcellaneous Obfervations. — The moft remarkable pheno- 
menon that has been obferved here was about eight years a- 
go, when what is called a corona or halo, fuperbly bright and 
luminous, confifting of two bows, concentric, with an appa- 
rent interval of from three to four feet between them, and 
extending over a great part of the hemifphere, was diftinctly 
feen. — There are feveral flag Hones, from 8 to 9 feet high 
above the ground, which tradition lays, were erected to com- 
memorate battles fought between the natives and the Danes. 
Wherever a Dani/h General or renowned warrior fell, this 
rough monument was erected to his memory — Hard by is a 
cairn of ftones, called Earl Alexander's Hillock, where, it is 
faid, he was flain ; a man, who lived at Thrumfter to an 
hundred years of age, found, about the end of laft century, a 
golden chain, which, in a year of famine, he fold to a bailie 
in Wick, for a boll of oat meai — The crop, in 1782, afford- 
ed a moft melancholy fpedtacle, being, while quite green, 
covered with froft and fnow, in the beginning of October. 
Some families, in this and the neighbouring parifhes, who 
were moft reduced, went to Lanark for employment at the 
cotton manufactures there, but, not meeting with the fuccefs 
they expected, were obliged to return or ftarve. A few 
emigrated to America, in confequence of the encouragement 
they expected to meet with there, in which, however, they 
were miferably difappointed. So wretched a crop was una- 
voidably fucceeded by a dearth in 1783, when one family 
could lcar^ely furnifh another, though in a plentiful country 
for victual, with any quantity howevtr fmall. The effects of 
rhat failure would have been very ferious indeed, had it not 
been for a moft feafonable and providential aid from govern- 
ment ; in confequence of which none died of want. — in a

keep down the price of victual among themfelves. Some- 
times a part of their capital is lent out at interest. Nothing-

<p>Name, Extent, Surface, CSV. 

THE parifh of Dailly is fituated nearly in the center of 
Carrick, one of the three diftricls of the county of 
Ayr. The name is probably defcriptive of the principal part 
of the parilh, which confifts of a dale or valley ftretehing 
nlong the banks of the river of Girvan, and bounded on 
both fides by hills of moderate height. From N. £. to S-. 
W. the parifh extends in the line of the river about 6 miles 
in length, and varies irregularly in breadth from 6 to 4 
miles. The number of acres it contains has never been 
afcertained by actual meafurement, but probably exceeds 
17000. Prior to the year 1650, its limits were of much 
wider extent, comprehending a great part of what was then 
ere£led into the parifh of Barr. Even within its prefent more 
moderate bounds, it exhibits great variety of furface. Gentle 
and irregular flopes, interfperfed with holms and meadows, 
and beautifully diverfiried with natural woods and planta- 
tions, occupy the lower part of the valley, above which the 
hills on both fides rife with various degrees of fteepnefs, and

and uncultivated moors. The only river in the parifh is the 
Girvan, which in its ordinary flate is of very moderate 
breadth, and no where navigable. It is fed by numberlefs 
fmaller flreams from the hills, fome of which defcend 
through deep and woody glens, admired for piclurefque and 
romantic beauty. Of thefe glens by much the moft remark- 
able and extenfive lies on the eaftern extremity of the parilh, 
near Kilkerran, the feat of Sir Adam Ferguflbn. It has 
lately been made more acceflible by a path of nearly a mile 
in length, cut along the brink of the torrent; and will, in 
time, receive a vaft addition to its prefent beauty from the 
trees which have been planted on its craggy and precipitous 
banks. JSTear the lower extremity of this wild and romantic 
dell, once flood a chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, from 
which it ftill retains the name of the Lady-glen.

which this parifh abounds are coal, lime, freeftone, and 
marl. The fields of coal, in particular, are uncommonly 
rich and extenfive, and were it not for the expence of land 
carriage to the coaft, and the want of a good harbour at Gir- 
van, might fupply the demands of an extenfive exportation, 
Except towards the lower extremity of the parifh, they lie 
moftly on the declivity of the hills on the north fide of the 
valley. Thofe on the lands of Mr Hamilton of Bargeny 
and Mr Kennedy of Dunure alone, are at prefent wrought ; 
and furnilh about 9000 tons annually, at the rate of 3 s. 4 d. 
per ton, merely for home cpnfumption. It deferves to be 
mentioned, that a Angle foam, belonging to Mr Kennedy, 
meafures 18 feet in thicknefs, and lies in fo favourable a 
pofition, that the coal is drawn out on fledges at a very 
moderate expence. 

The

Stati/lical Account 



The principal lime-work in this diftric"k is at Craighead, a 
hill near the weftern extremity of the parifh, belonging to 
Mr Hamilton of Bargeny. The eaft face of this hill confifts 
of one vaft unbroken mafs of lime-ftone, the dimenfions of 
which are imperfectly known. In confequence of the in- 
creafed demand for lime as a manure, the rent of this quarry 
has within the laft twenty years rifen from iol. to 245 1. 
per annum. — Argillaceous marl is found in moft parts of the 
parifh, and has of late been ufed as a manure with great 
fuccefs. Beds of freeftone are very numerous and extenfive: 
fome of them uncommonly fine, and much efteemed in or- 
namental building. The principal ridge of hills on the 
fouth fide of the valley appears to confift chiefly of this fub- 
ftance, interfperfed with ftrata of marl and lime-ftone, over 
which are piled up enormous maffes of pudding ftone. 
Thofe on the north fide are probably of a fimilar ftrudlure , 
on fome of them are found extenfive rocks of a bafaltic na- 
ture, in the rude and irregular form diftinguilhed by the 
name of trapp. In none of them have veins of any kind of 
metal been difcovered — In many places the land was for- 
merly covered with a vaft number of thofe " foiitary maffes 
" of granite," fo frequent in fome other parts of Scotland, and 
the origin of which has fo long puzzled the ingenuity of the 
naturalift. Splitting and removing thefe has proved an ex- 
penfive, but necefiary ftep, to the complete improvement of 
•the foil. 

Many fmall chalybeate fprings, fcattered over different 
parts of the parifh, feem to indicate the exiftence of exten- 
five ftrata of iron-ftone ; but their fources have never been 

explored. On the declivity of the range of hills towards 

the north, a water, ftrongly impregnated with calcareous

earth, * burfts out at different parts of the furface, in which 
may be diftinctly traced the procefs of petrifaction, as it is 
commonly, though very wuhilofophicaliy, called. Large 
maffes of opaque petrified mofs arc here formed; but the 
rapid evaporation of the water, in confequence of its free ex- 
pofure to rhe fun and external air, prevents the concretion 
of the calcareous earth into thofe beautiful chryftalline forms 
fo much admired in the fpars of Derby (hire. 

Soil. — The nature of the foil is as various as the furface 
is diverfified. Along the banks of the river, the holms and 
meadows, in fome places of confiderable extent, are generally 
of a light, but very fertile, foil, and capable of the higheft 
cultivation. Wheat, though not a general crop, h is bten 
raifed on fome of them with great fuccefs. i he more ele- 
vated grounds, which principally occupy the lower part of 
the valley, are chiefly arable, and, in favourable feafons, j re- 
duce excellent crops of oats and barley. Thole on the louth 
fide of the river are moftly of a light and dry foil, refting on , 
a bottom of gravel, and are peculiarly favourable for paftu- 
rage. On the north fide they are, in general, better, in con- 
fequence of a larger admixture of clay, both in the foil and 
inferior ftrata. The mountainous parts of the parifh are al- 
moft folely appropriated to the pafturage of fheep and cattle 
and although certainly inferior in value, are fuppofed greatly 
to exceed in extent the cultivated valley below. The foil i s 
thin, wet, and fpungy ; and in many places covered with 
large tracts of mofs, from which, before the general ufe of 
coal, the inhabitants were fupplied with the greater part of 
their fuel. 

Climate, 



3 8 Statijlical Account 

Climate.— In the valley, the air is ufually dry, mild, and 
of an agreeable freflinefs ; on the higher grounds, it is often 
moift and chilly. This diftridt, in common with all the 
country lying along the coaft of the Atlantic, is fubject to 
frequent fhowers from the weft ; but the air is rarely loaded 
with fogs, and the average quantity of rain throughout the 
year, it is fuppofed, does not exceed that on the other fide of 
the ifiand. The rains from the eaft are lefs frequent, but 
ufually more continued. In autumn, they often damage and 
endanger the crops ; but long habit has taught the farmer 
activity and fkill in counteracting the evils of the climate. 

State of Agriculture and Pajlurage. — The mode of cultiva- 
tion, and implements of agriculture employed in this diftricl, 
prefent nothing worthy of particular notice. It is not above 
thirty years fince the flovenly and unproductive fyftetn of 
hufbandry, which fo long difgraced the whole of Scotland, 
firft began in this parifh to give way to a more fpirited and 
ikillful practice. "Within that period, all the arable, and a 
great part of the pafture, lands have been inclofed. — The 
plentiful ufe of lime, marl, and other manures have been 
adopted with great effect ; — a more judicious and profitable 
rotation of crops has been followed •, — and both hay and pa- 
fture have been much improved by the culture of artificial 
grafles. Notwithstanding the fuperiority of the prefent fyf- 
tem of management, over that which formerly prevailed, 
there is little reafon to doubt that it is ftill very far from 
having attained that degree of perfection, to which increa- 
sing experience and wealth may probably carry it, even in a 
diftricr. not naturally the moft fertile. Hitherto, however, 
improvement, in the feveral branches of hufbandry, and in 
the general ftate of the country, has advanced as rapidly as 
can be expected in a diftrict where the accumulation of ftoclc 

has

has not been aided by the introduction of trade or manufac- 
tures.— -Formerly a very confiderable importation of corn 
annually was neceflary for the fubfiftence of the inhabi- 
tants*, but of late, befides abundantly fupplytng the demands 
of an increafing population, the farmer has been able to 
ipare a little for the conlumption of iome neighbouring dif- 
tricts. 

The lands, however, in this pari fh, and indeed throughout 
the greater part of Garrick, feem better calculated by nature 
for pafturage than for agriculture, and juifify the character 
given them in the iixteenth century by Buchanan, — u Pafcuis 
« foecundci) non infelix frumento." The rearing and feeding 
of cattle, therefore, has always been a principal, and perhaps 

the 

* Buchanan, in the fhort topographical fhetch of Scotland 
at the beginning of his hiftory, fays of Carrick, — " Tota terref- 
" tribus maricimifque copiis non modo fibi fufficiens, fed vicinis 
" multa fuppeditam" ; (L. I. c. 20 ) a praife to which, certain- 
ly, it was by no means entitled thirty or forty years ago. From 
the year J529 to 1534, Buchanan was retained by Gilbert 
Earl of Caffillis as a tutor or literal y companion, and ap, 
pears, during part of that time, to have redded with him in. 
Scotland ; we may, therefore, fuppofe him perfectly acquainted 
with a diltritf in which his illultrious pupil poffeiTed extenfive 
property and feudal jurifdiclion. If we are to credit his ac- 
count, the unavoidable inference feems to be, that Carrick, after 
the age of Buchanan, muft have fallen from a rank, in the fcale 
of comparative fertility and wealth, to which, perhaps, it is not 
yetieftored. \ 

Thofe who are curious in tracing the comparative value of 
money in this country at different periods, will not be difpleaf- 
ed with the following ftatement of the prices of corn and cattle 
in Carrick at the time of which we have been fpeaking. In an 
inventory of the goods of Giles Blair, Lady Row, contained in 
her teftament, dated at Balterfan, (in the parifh of Kirkofwald) 
Auguft 30. 1530 — a cow is valued at 2 merks, — an ox at 30 s. 
— a two zetr.auid beaji at 1 merk, — a fheep at 5 s. — a lamb at 
i6d. — a boll of bear and meal at 12 s. — and a boll of oats at 
6s. (all Scotch money.) It affords no very favourable idea of 
the agriculture of Carrick, in the fixteenth century, that one 
boll of meal was then equivalent in value to two of oats.

the mod profitable branch of employment to the farmer. Im- 
provement in this department has gone hand in hand with 
that of agriculture, and has not, in its effe&amp;s, been lefs re- 
markable or beneficial. By means of that great and rapid rife 
in the price of cattle, to which, chiefly, the origin of improve- 
ment in this country may be traced, the farmer has been in- 
duced and enabled to meliorate his pafture land in confe- 
quence of which, and in part alfo of attention to the breed, 
the ftock has in a few years greatly increafed in number, and 
ftill more in value. The cattle are moftly of the well known 
Galloway breed, intermixed with a few imported from Ire- 
land and Argyleftiire. A confiderable' number is here com- 
pletely fattened for the markets of this country; but by much 
the greater part is bought up by drovers, to be more highly 
fed for the Englifh market, in the richer paftures of the South. 

The moorland in the mountainous part of the parifh, hither- 
to regarded as incapable of melioration, is moftly employed 
in the pafturing of fheep. By a judicious {election of the beft 
and ftrongeft fheep for the purpofe of breeding, the ftock has 
of late been confiderably mended, and the attention to that 
fubjecl, which now begins to be more generally awakened, will 
no doubt gradually lead to higher improvement. When fed 
to proper age, they are much efteemed for the delicacy of their 
flefh ; but the farmers believe it more profitable, on the whole, 
to bring them to market at two, or, at moft, three years old. 
They are found to be extremely hardy, but are in general of 
rather a fmall fize, and their wool is not remarkable either 
for quantity or finenefs. The moft intelligent farmers, how- 
ever, feem very much to doubt the expediency ot importing 
a larger and more delicate race ; and, though not averfe to ex- 
periment, will probably be cautious in parting with the pre- 
fent hardy breed of the country, inured to the cold, wetncfs, 
and bleak expofure of their native hills.

The number of thofe fed on the improved paftures of the 
valley is comparatively fmall, but the great profits they are 
found to bring, will probably lead to its increafe. In the courfe 
of a Angle feafon, they generally treble their value ; and a 
fmall parcel of indifferent ewes, introduced into rich pafture 
about the end of October, have, with their lambs and fleeces, 
been known in one year to rife from 5 s. to 20 s. each. 

The following ftatement of the quantity and value of ftock, 
and of the annual produce of land, in the parifh of Dailly, has 
been collected from the beft information which could be pro- 
cured; and approaches, perhaps, as nearly to accuracy as can 
be expected, in an inquiry where we muft often refort to pro- 
bable calculation and conjecture, to fupply the place of abfo- 
lute certainty and truth.

State of Landed Property. — No confiderable property in land 
has been fold in the parilh for feveral years' paft ; and altnoft 
the whole has remained in the poITrffion of the fame families 
for many generations. The lands are at prefent divided, but in 
very unequal portions, among eight proprietors ; five of whom 
ufually refide in the parifh ; viz. Mr Hamilton of Bargeny, 
Sir Adam Ferguffon of Kilkerran, S:r Andrew Cathcart 
of Carleton, Mr Kennedy of Dunure, and Captain Ken- 
nedy of Drummelland. All of thefe gentlemen inherit more 
extenfive landed property elfewhere ; but their anceftors, pro- 
bably at a very remote period, had fixed the refidence of 
their families in this beautiful valley. Even in the fix- 
teenth century, Buchanan fays of the water of Girvan ; 

Multis amoetiis viliis cingitur. And to the conftant refi- 
dence of fo many country gentlemen, this parifh, no doubt, 
ftill owes much of its beauty. Among the moffc obvious 
proofs of this, may be mentioned, the plantations of foreffc 
trees which have been made in addition to the natural woods 
of the country. Thofe on the eflate of Kilkerran, made by 
Sir Adam Ferguffon, and his father the late. Lord Kilkerran, 
in this parifh, and within the contiguous borders of Kirkofwald 
andMaybole, cover about 400 Scots acres. Thofe on the lands 
of Dalquharran occupy 127 acres, and have been made chief- 
ly by the prefent proprietor Mr Kennedy. This gentleman 
has lately built a very magnificent houfe in the modern caftls 
fiyle, on a plan of the late Mr Robert Adam. The planta- 
tions, as well as natural woods, on the other eftates in the pa- 
rifii, are alfo confiderable. 

Rent of Land. — The valued rent of the parifh is 3265 I. 
ios. 6 d. Scotch. The real rent has, as ufual, kept pace with 1 
the increafe of wealth and progreffive melioration of land. In 
1740, the annual rent of the whole parifh fcarcely amounted 
to icooh Sterling: and during 20 fucceeding years, its rife 

was

was very inconfiderable. From the year 1760 or 1765, may 
be dated the beginning of general improvement in agriculture 
in this parifh ; and, fince that period, the rent of land has 
rifen gradually and rapidly to double and treble its former 
amount. In the year 1780, it had rifen to about 2300 I. At 
prefent (1792) it amounts to 3300 I. 

State of Population. — Of the ftate of population in this parifh 
during the laft century, fcarcely any traces now remain; and 
even for a great part of the prefent century, the only fource 
of information which exifts, is a regifter of baptifms, the ac- 
curacy of which cannot abfolutely be depended on. For the 
laft 40 years, this regifter, it is believed, has been much more 
accurately kept *, and during the fame period, a very exact 
private regifter of deaths has been fortunately preferved. 
Chiefly from thefe is collected the following table of births, 
deaths, and marriages in the parifh, from iff January 1751 
to 31ft December 1790, both inclufive, divided into 4 pe- 
riods of 10 years each. 

Tears 

• 

* It may not be improper here to remark the pernicious tenden- 
cy of the tax impoied, in the year 1783, on the regifters of births 
and burials — a tax equally injudicious and unproductive. As 
the only penalty annexed to the non-payment of the tax is the 
omiflion of the article in the regifter, the Iegiflature has virtually 
conferred a premium on every act of negligence or obftinacy. 
While it remains unrepealed, it muft infallibly introduce confu- 
fion and inaccuracy into one of the moft authentic records of the 
progrefiive population of the kingdom. From a calculation of 
the annual number of births and of deaths in Scotland, it ap- 
pears that the grofs produce of the tax, exacted with the utmoft 
rigour, would not amount to 1500I Sterling. It may be quef- 
tioned if the money actually received by government exceeds 
one half of that fum.

exifted but In the defefts of the regifter, no obvious caufe * 
can be affigned. It is certain, however, both from the pre- 
[ ceding calculations and from adhial furvey, that, for the laft 
thirty or forty years, the population has been gradually and 
rapidly increafing. The return ftated by Dr Webfter, whofe 
report was drawn up in the year 1755 t» 1S 8 39 » and if this 
account be not inaccurate, which, however, the preceding 
ftatement affords fome ground to fufpect, the population of

From 

* It has been fuggefted to the writer of this report, that this 
decreafe of population may have been owing, in part, to the fa- 
mine which prevailed fo generally throughout Scotland towards, 
the clofe of the laft century. It is indeed very certain that the 
effecls of that famine were felt with great feverity in this coun- 
try. The diftricT: of Carrick is faid to have been deferted by 
many of its inhabitants ; and it is well known, that feveral 
farms remained unoccupied for many years fubfequent to that 

event. . 

\ Dr Webfter's report was drawn up in the year 1755 ; but 
from his own account (See Introd quoted in Pref. Vol II, 
Stat. Account of Scotland,) it appears probable that the ma- 
terials for that report had been collected at leaf! ten years be- 
fore. If that was the cafe, the returns made to him mud have 
given the population of Scotland as it flood about the year 
1745. This hypothefis, if admitted, will nearly reconcile Dr 
Webfter's return from Dailly with the preceding calculation 
from the number of births.

It may be here remarked that no very extraordinary in- 
fiances of longevity, well authenticated, have occurred of 
late in the parifh. A man who died lately at the age of 97, 
and a man and woman both at the age of 94, are the only 
inftanccs worthy of notice. 

The inhabitants are collected into 368 families, fo that 
there are nearly 4^. perfons in each family. As marriage is 
not difcouraged either by a deficiency of the neceffaries of 
life, or by an excefs of its luxuries, the number of thofe who 
continue unmarried after the ufual age of entering into that 
connection is comparatively very fmall. This will more di- 
ftinctly appear from the following ftatement ; to which it 
may be premifed, that had the number of unmarried perfons 
been taken from thofe above the age of twenty five, as would 
perhaps have been more proper, it would probably have been 
very confiderably diminifhed ;

number of children produced, at an average, from each mar- 
riage, is nearly 4-f. 

In the calculations offered above of the probable amount 
of population at different periods, it was fuppofed, as ufual, 
that the annual averages of births and of deaths were, to the 
total number of inhabitants, reflectively, as i to 26 and to 
36. On a comparifon, however, of the annual number? of 
births and deaths from the year 1781 to the year 1790, with 
the actual ftate of population in the year 1791, the refpective 
proportions appear, during that period, to have been as 1 
to 29.6 and to 47.6. Of courfe, the number of births is 
to that of deaths as 47.6 to 29.6; or nearly as 5 to 3. The 
proportion between the annual marriages and the whole po- 
pulation is nearly as 1 to 160. 

By far the greater number of the prefent inhabitants have 
been born and educated in the parifh. Almoft the whole 
are Scotch, with exception of a few Irifh, whom the rifing 
wages of labour have of late induced to fettle in the parifh.

from Ireland, is, however, much more than counterbalanced 
by that of thofe who leave the parifli and refort to towns, 
tempted by the higher wages of manufactories and domeftic 
fervice. 

Occupations, Mode of Living, &amp;c— The inhabitants live 
moftly in the open country, and chiefly in the lower and more 
cultivated part of the parifh ; only an inconfiderable propor- 
tion, not exceeding 170 fouls, refide in a {'null village conti- 
guous to the church. — The great body of the people derive 
their fubfiftence from agriculture, and the common mecha- 
nical arts connected with it. It is computed that nearly one 
third of the whole families in the parifli are fupported by the 
wages of common labour. Moft of them, however, alio rent 
a garden, and a piece of indifferent ground for pot herbs, 
potatoes, and fometimes a little corn and flax. No confider-

fable manufacture has ever been eftablifhed in the parifh. The 
only artificers are thofe every where required for fupplying 
the common neceiTaries of life. A confiderable number of 
women, in the lower ranks, employ the greater part of their 
time in working up the inferior wool of the country into a 
coarfe and flimfy cloath, which is carried to the fairs of Ayr 
and Maybole, and bought up for exportation at the rate of 
8 d. or iod. per yard. By this fpecies of rude manufacture, 
a few unmarried women and widows earn the greater part of 
a very fcanty fubfiitence; but, in general, the profits of' it are 
confumed in purchafing and working up the finer wool into 
cloaths for themfelves and their families. The following table 
will give a diftincl view of the diviiion of the inhabitants ac- 
cording to their refpedtive occupations and modes of iubfif- 
tence.

In their manner and ftyl» of living, the inhabitants have, 
within the laft 20 or 30 years, experienced a very great, 
though gradual, revolution. Before their induftry began to be 
Simulated by the prolpecl of increafing wealth, the drefs and 
mode of living, among the lower ranks, were mean, dirty, 
and pernicious ; and even among thofe in better circumftan- 
ces, were not much lefs fcanty or inelegant. Both are now 
as plentiful and commodious as they were formerly the re- 
verfe, and are ftill perceptibly improving. The low, miferable 
huts, in which the moft confiderable farmers, at the time, 
were formerly contented to lodge, are now replaced with 
tolerably neat and commodious houfes. Even the cottages pf 
the loweft ranks begin to affume a more cleanly and comfor- 
table appearance *. 

Poor 

* The price of labour, it is believed, has been gradually rif- 
fng during the whole of the prefent century ; but within the laft 
30 years, with a rapidity unexperienced at any former period. 
About 60 years a^o the wages of a common labourer were 2 d. 
fer day, with victuals. Taylors and Ihoemakers were then ufu- 
ally hired by the day, and received, the former 3d. the latter,

pcor.— The wages of artificers and common labourers are 
in ordinary cafes fufficient for rearing and maintaining a fa- 
mily ; but do not always enable them to. lay up a fund for 
old age or accidental difability. In luch fituations, they «- 
ther receive occafional afihlance, or are inrolled on the lift 
of paupers, for regular fupply from the charitable funds of 
the parifli. Idiots and furious perfons, and the children of 
thofe who die in poverty, are alfo ufually provided for from 
the fame funds. Thefe funds arife almoft entirely from vo- 
luntary contribution, and confift of weekly collections at the 
church, penalties, dues on proclamation of marriages, and 
the intereft of about 200 1. ; amounting, on an average of the 

laft 



4d. wttk their victuals. Thofe who were Occafionally employ- 
ed as mafons or carpenters, in ereditig the rude and inartificial 
houfes of the inhabitants, received 6 d. per day, with victuals. 
The wages of a male farm fervant were then 1 1. per annum, and 
thofe Of a female fervant, 13 s. 4d. with the perquifite of an 
apron or a pair of fhoes. 

At prefent the daily wages of a common labourer, during 
eight months of the year, vary from iod. to is. and from 8 d. 
Or 10 d. during the winter. The annual income of a common 
labourer, therefore, without reckoning days of iicknefs, &amp;c. will 
run from 12I. 1 1 s. iod. to 14I. 15s. 8d. Mafons now re- 
ceive is. 8d. carpenters and joiners is 6 d. per day. Shoe- 
makers and taylors are now rarely hired by the day j the latter, 
when fo employed, ufually receive 8 di or 10 d. With victuals. 
Male farm fervants receive from 61. to 9I. per annum; and fe- 
male fervants from 2 1. 10 s. to 4 1. During the harveft, the 
extraordinary demand for labourers ufually raifes their wagss 
very confiderably. 

The riling wages of common labour and domeflic fervice, have 
of late been the fubject of frequ;nt complaint among thofe whole 
intereft is immediately affected As however it is one of the moft 
unequivocal mark., it ought, by an indifferent fptctaior, to be 
regarded as one of the happiell effects of increalin^ induftry 
and opulence. It mult not, however, be concealed, th 1 am ig 
thofe of both fexes who are unem^ai railed with the cares and ex- 
pence of a family, the advanced wages of labour have had an 
obvious tendency to cherifh the idle vanity nf drefs, and fome- 
times even the more rvunuusi appetite lor dillipation.

Iaft ten years, to no more than 38I. /«• annum. Thefe 
funds are i'olcly in the management of the minifter and kirk- 
feflion ; and, in diftributing a lum fo moderate, the moft rigid 
oeconomy, and vigilant attention, are required to diicriininate 
the objects of real diftrefs. The number of poor at prefent 
on the roll is about 40, all of whom receive affiftance in 
their own houfes ; except idiots and children, for whom a 
regular board is paid. As the fcanty allowance which can 
be afforded by the fellion is feldom adequate to a complete 
maintenance, fome of the moft helplefs and indigent receive 
a licence, which ufually procures them a fmall penfion from 
the different refiding heritors, and intitles them to alk alms 
within the parifh. When thefe means are infufficient, they 
are obliged to have recourfe to their own induftry or to com- 
mon begging. 

Religious EJlablifoment. — All the inhabitants of this parifh 
profefs the eftablifhed religion, with the exception of a few 
ieceders, not exceeding five or fix, attached to the fe£ts of 
Burghers or Antiburghers. The ftipend of the minifter 
confifts of 3 chalders of meal, and 1 of bear; 400 1. Scotch, 
and an augmentation of 25 1. Sterling granted in 1785. The 
glebe coniifts of feven acres of arable land, worth about 10 1. 
per annum. The value of the whole living amounts, at an 
average, to about 105 1. Sterling. The manle was built in 
1758, and co ft about 190 1. In 1696, the church was remo- 
ved from Old Dailly to its prefent more centrical fituation. 
It was rebuilt in 1706, and coft 600 1. The intereft of 
thefe two fums at the rate of 7 per cent, raifes the annual 
cxpence of the ecclefiaftical eftablilhment to about idol. 

School. — Be fides a few private teachers, occafionally em- 
ployed by thofe in the more remote pares of the parifh, there 

is 



cf Dailfy,

is a regular parochial fchool in the village, in which are 
taught Englifh, Latin, French, writing, arithmetic, and book- 
keeping. The number of Icholars is ufually from 40 to 60. 
The falary of the fchool-mairer is S I. 6 s. 8 d. which, with 
the fchool fees, a houfe rent free, and his falary and per- 
quisites as clerk to the kirk-feffion, raifes the annual income 
of his office to nearly 30 1. 

Mifcellaneous Qbfa-vnthns . — In antiquity, this parifh has 
nothing very rare or curious to boaft of. At a place called 
Machry -kill, there remain the veftiges of a fmall church or 
chapel, probably dedicated to St Macarius. — In this parifh, 
and indeed throughout Carrick, the names of places, not evi- 
dently modern, are all of Celtic origin; and by a fkilfull ety- 
mologift might ull perhaps be traced to fome local circurri- 
ftance or peculiarity of firuation. A confiderable number oc- 
cur in composition with the words Bal, Drum, Knock, and 
Kil ; as Balibeg, (i. e. little town) Bale amy, Drumgirnan, 
Drnmochreen, Knorlrochcr, Ktiockgerran, Ki/ochan, Kilkerrati^ 
Kilgramic. There are many more which cannot be reduced 
to any of thefe dalles. 

In the cuftoms and manners of the people, there is no- 
thing -very peculiar or characteriftie. The farmers are intel- 
ligent and resectable ; thofe in the lower ranks are induf- 
trious, honeft, and much lels addicted than formerly to ha- 
bitual intemperance. They are in general attentive to the 
education of their children; for there is fcarcely an indivi- 
dual in the parifh who has not been taught to read and write 
Engliih. They difcover no peculiar bias to any particular 
profcfllon. Their inland fituation protects them from cat- 
ching the infection of a feafaring life ; and the number of 
thofe who have at any time eniifted in the army has been 
very inconfiderable.

C Prefbytery of Kintyre. — Synod and County of Ar* 



By the Reverend Alexander Campbell, A. M.</head> 



<p>Name, &amp;c. 

KILCALMONELL is the mod northerly part of the 
peninfula of Kinryre, being bounded on the N. by the 
ifthmus at Tarbert. For a fhort diftance, it comprehends 
the whole breadth of the peninfula, from Loch Tarbert on 
the W. to Loch Fyne on the E. till leparated from the lat- 
ter by the narrow but long parifh of Skipncfs, whole nor- 
thern extremity once formed a part of Kilcalmonell. The 
W. fide extends the whole length of Weft Tarbert Loch, 
which is about 1 2 miles, and ftretches 4 miles beyond it, 
along the coaft of the Atlantic Ocean. The breadth of Kil- 
calmonell is from 3 to 5 miles. Kilberry is fituated in that 
divifion of Argylefliire which gives name to the county. It 
is of a triangular form ; bounded on the S. by Loch Tarbert, 
on the W. by the Atlantic Ocean; and on the N. E. by 
South Knapdale. Kilcalmonell, in Gaelic Cilt a Challum an 
£a//a, is derived from eill, which now fiynifies a ourying 
place, but is fuppofed to have meant originally the lame 
"with the Latin cella ; Challum figni6es Columba, and Ealla a 
fwan. It is probable that the Columba here mentioned is 

the 



of Kilcalmonnell and Rilberry. £ji 

$he fame perfon to whom many other churches are dedicated, 
and who founded the celebrated monaftery of Icollumkill, in 
Gaelic / Challum Chilli y the ifland of Columba founder of 
cells, a defignation which would very naturally be given him, 
inftead of his former one of Ealla, when he arrived at the 
end of his peregrinations. Kilberry means the burying place 
of St Berry, of whom no hiftory is on record ; but it would 
appear that the principal heritor of that parifh is defcen- 
ded from the faint, as he is in pofleflion of his name, his 
place of refidence, and his revenues 

Appearance, SoiL &amp;c — The face of the country has the great- 
eft variety in its appearance. It confifts of flats and hills, val- 
lies, woods, and lakes. The foil is equally various, confift- 
ing of fand, clay, loam, mofs, and moor ; the laft, confti- 
tuting by far the greater! proportion of the parifh, is covered 
with heath, and for the moft part ill adapted to culture. The 
quantity of arable land may be guefled at, from the account 
of crops in the ftatiftical table, the one half of it being fup- 
pofed annually in tillage. The climate is diftinguifhed by no 
lefs variety. The transitions from mild to cold, from dry to 
wet, are fudden and frequent ; embarrafing the projects, and 
difappointing the expectations, of the hufbandman. This oq- 
cafions frequent fevers in Spring and Autumn, but they are 
feldom mortal, and are almoft the only difeafes to which a- 
dults are fubjedt. Children are afflicted with the hooping 
cough, meafles, and fmall-pox, but inoculation has of late 
become almoft univerfal. 

Canal, 

* The entrance to Kintyre was formerly defended by a chain 
of forts, one at each end of the ifthmus at Tarbert, and one in 
the centre. The principal of them, the caftle of Tarbert, is at 
this day a fine old ruin. It is faid that it was fupplied with 

water 



Stati/lical Account 



Canah Roads, cjrV.-lnficad of the projected canal at Cri, 
pan, to fave the navigation round Kmtyre, it was jp content 
plat ion to have one at larbert, by cutting through the above 
mtntioned iiihuius, w,hich is only one mije in. breadth, while 
the dit'rance from Crinan to Lochgilphead is not lefs than 
five. The faving of expence, with the fuperiority of eatfc 
and well Tarbert lochs as harbours, and for good anchoring 
ground, would more than compenfate the difference of navi- 
gation faved by the Crinan canal. There are three good 
lines of road in the parifh, kept in repair by an equivalent 
paid for the ftatute labour. One of them interfecls the pe- 
ninfuL «.f Kmtyre, at the diftance of fix miies from its ifth- 
mus. The other two are on the oppofue fhores of Loch 

Tarbert, 

water by a fubmarine paffage in pipes acrofs the harbour ; a cir- 
cumflan^e which, if true, fiiews that our anceftcs were bet- 
ter acquainted than we fuppofe with the laws of hydrolta- 
tics. Taibert was in the lalt century the feat of a fheriffdom 
of the fame name. There are the remains of many other old 
forts in the parifh, particularly one with vitrified walls, and 
another with a very thick wall of dry (tones, both built on the 
hill of Dunfkeig, which commands the opening of Loch Tar- 
bert. There are many cairns in the parifh. Some years ago, 
a cottager found, in a mois on the eflate of Lord Stonefieid, 
feveral pieces of ancient brafs armour. 

Partly fituated in the Kilberry divifion of this parifh is Sliahh 
Gaoi/, The Hill of Love, celebrated in ancient flory as the 
fcene of the death of Diarmid, the Achilles of the Fingalian 
heroes, and the great progenitor of the family of Campbell, 
who are known to this day by the name of Chnn DharmaiJ, 
The children of Diarmid. 

Among the curiofuies in this parifh are immenfe banks of 
Oyftcr fhells in Loch Tarber t. with which the inhabitants ma- 
nure their lands ; and potatoes found growing fpontaneoufly on 
the eflate of Largie, in different parts of the fame farm, one of 
which is diflant half a mile from any place where that root ever 
had been planted. The fact is certain. How they came there, 
is left to the invefiigation of the curious. Might they not be 
natural to a foil fa favourable to their growth, as well as to 
America, or the iflands in the Pacific Ocean ?

Tarbert, parallel to its direction ; and, for the moft part, 
through the fine natural woods with which its fides are 
adorned. 

Eccleftajlical State and Schools. — The Duke of Argyll is pa- 
tron of the parifh, and has a fmali property in it. The 
amount of the teinds is 178 bolls victual, and 308 1. 4 s. 8 d. 
Scotch ; out of which the minifter, though the ftipend was 
lately augmented by the Teind Court, gets only 63 1. Ster- 
ling, and 2 chalders of victual, Linlithgow meafure ; a fti- 
pend perfectly inadequate to the circumftances of the parifh, 
which is large, populous, difcontiguous, and a place of great 
refort, and far below what, in the prefent circumftances of 
the country, the rank and fituation of the clergy would re- 
quire. There is no manfe. The minifter receives, in lieu 
thereof, 12 1. 10 s. annually from the heritors. He rents a 
farm and farm-houfe. Farms are abfolutely necefTary to the 
clergy in the country, a legal glebe being too poor a lubfti- 
tute for the want of regular markets. There are 4! acres 
arable land for a glebe, and a fervitude on a neighbouring 
farm of 4 cows grafs. The fervitude was originally on the 
whole of the farm ; but, from the inability of the Scotch 
clergy to cope with fuperior power, the farm has been fub- 
divided, and the minifter's cows turned over to a bleak moor 
where the cattle, even in fummer, are ftarving. 

There are two parochial places of worlhip, one in the Kil- 
calmonell, and one in the Kilberry divifion. They are dif- 
tant from each other 5 miles, including a mile of lea, being 
the breadth of Loch Tarbert. There is a church built only 
at one of them, which is too fmali for the people, who are 
obliged to pay a heavy tax, in name of feat rent, to the heri- 
tors, for permiffion to attend it. This laft obfervation like- 
wife applies to a chapel at Tarbert, where divine fervice is 

VoL - X H performed

performed by a miffionary, paid by the committee of the 
General AfTembly for managing the royal bounty. He re- 
fides in the parifh of S. Knapdale ; but the greateft: part of 
the miffion belongs to this parifh. There was a prefbyterial 
decreet patted, for building a church in the Kilberry divifion 
of the parifh, many years fince, which, it is expected, will 
foon take effect. The language of the natives is Gaelic j 
but fome of them underftand a little Englifh. The ininifter 
preaches in both languages. 

There is a parochial fchool in the parilh ; but only a fmall 
part of this diftriit has been in the practice of contributing 
to its fupport. There is a decreet for the minimum of legal 
parochial falary j but no part of the fum contained in it has 
as yet been paid. Two fchoolmafters, appointed by the So- 
ciety in Scotland for propagating Chriltian Knowledge, have 
each a fmall allowance. Their fituation is not rendered fo 
comfortable as it ought by the heritors or parifhioners. The 
poverty of the people obliges them to employ the children in 
farming and herding, which either prevents them entirely 
from going to fchool, cr makes their attendance too irregular 
to receive much benefit therefrom. 

Manners of the People. — The people are, in general, mild 
and docile, punctual in their obfervance of religious ordi- 
nances, and regular in their lives. At a diftance from the 
public road and from ftrangers, clothes, when warning, are 
expofc-d at night without being watched. And it is to be 
doubted whether any parifh in Scotland can produce fo long 
a lift of people, with fo few inftances of crimes *. 

Poor.

fialiiv reconciled to the hardships of their fituation, is their fond-

Poor. — The funds for the flipport of the poor arife from 
the weekly collections at the places of worlhip, which are 
from 2 s. to. 4 s. ; the fines for delinquencies; and the inte- 
reft of favings made from the funds, when there were not fo 
many poor on the roll as at prefent. Thofe funds are diftri- 
bured, at quarterly meetings, by the kirk-leffion, to fuch of 
the poor as are confined to their houfes by age or ficknefs* 
Of this defcription there are on the lift (not including thofe 
within the miflion, which provides for its own poor) 33, to 
whom the funds will by no means afford an adequate relief. 
Such as are able to go about to beg, have licences for that 
purpofe from, the kirk-feffion, by which, however, they are 
confined to the parifh. The minifter has attempted, but 
without effect, to keep off vagrant poor, of whom a great 
number make their appearance in this parifh *. 

FiJ}} csV. — The well known and highly prized Loch Fyne 
herrings are frequently found on the eafl coaft of this parifh * 

in 

nefs for dogs. Almoft every family has one ; and, in fome fa- 
milies, there are two or three. Even paupers were found to 
have fo unwarrantable an attachment to thefe animals, that 
threats to ftrike them off the poor's roll were obliged to be ufed 
before they could be prevailed upon to part with them. From 
the ftatiftical table, it appears there are 400 dogs in the parifh'. 
The food devoured by thefe animals would feed 400 pi^s, 
which, when a year old, would fell at 400 I. Deduct 40 1. for 
prime cod ; and the balance, 360 I. would be the annual favinjr 
to this parifh alone by fuch a fubflitution, befides prevention of 
danger from canine madnefs, as well as the lofs of fheep, of 
which no lefs than 140 were, a few vears ago, dedroyed by- 
dogs in a range of 8 mile's, in the courfe of a few weeks. 

* One of the paupers on the lift is a man 78 vears old, who,- 
in 1745, got, in defence of the piefent reigning 'family, repeat- 
ed and fevere wounds, the marks of which he will carry with 
rum to his grave.

in the immediate vicinity of the commodious harbour and 
fifhing village of Eaft Tarbert. Weft Tarbert loch has few 
fifh, excepting the fry of feath, known by the name of ciul- 
ditis, the taking of which, from the fmallnefs of their fize, 
is confidered only as an amufement. Mackarel fometimes 
vifit it. There are likewile fome fhell-fifh, particularly oyf- 
ters, which are fold on the fpot at 6 d. the hundred, and lent 
to the markets of Campbeltoun and Greenock. 

There are in this diftricl: feals and otters, the former fo 
numerous as to give name to a farm in the parifh, Ronachan, 
Seal Field. The conftant refort of this animal to Loch Tar- 
bert, is a proof that the quantity of fifh on the weft fide of 
the parifh is greater than apprehended. 

All the variety of quadrupeds (excepting deer) and of 
birds, native and migratory, (excepting the ptarmigan), 
found in any part of Scotland, appear in this parifh. Heath- 
fowl, in fome of the hill-farms, come in flocks, and do much 
damage to the corn j hares and partridges are no lefs defiruc- 
tive; yet, from the leverity of the game laws, the farmer is 
not allowed to protect his crops from them, without leave 
from his landlord, as well as a heavy tax to Government. 

Agriculture. — Some parts of the parifh are well fitted for 
railing grain. Were thefe places inclofed and fubdivided, 
and a judicious rotation of crops introduced, their produce 
might be more than doubled. Introducing oats inftead of 
bear, would alfo tend much to benefit the country. The 
produce would be greater ; much of the manure might be 
ufed for potatoes ; and the oats would not be manufactured, 
like the bear, into a pernicious, unwholefome fpirit. 

Captain Campbell, fon of Lord Stonefkld, one of the heri- 
tors cf the parifh, has refided in it for a few years back, and 
is almoft the only pcrfon therein who follows a fpirited plan 

of 



of Kilcalmonnell and Kilberrf* 6t 

of farming, by fubdividing, draining, ufing the beft utenfils, 
and introducing green crops and fown gralTes. It is unfor- 
tunate, however, that he has not fixed upon a better foil for 
\w operations. All Lord Stonefield's tenants, indeed, fow 
turnips, a crop peculiarly adapted to the climate of this 
country. But, until they have fmall and fufficient inclofures, 
at his Lord (hip's expence, (neither their own purfes nor leafes 
being able to afford them), it is not to be expelled that the 
turnip crops can fucceed. It is but juftice, however, to the 
memory of the late Stonefield, fheriff of the county, (whofe 
patriotifm and abilities, in promoting the Argyllfhire roads, 
will be long remembered), to obferve, that more has been 
clone for the improvement of this eftate, by large inclofures, 
draining, and planting, than in all the reft of the parifh put 
together. 

The minifter of this parifh pradYifes an improved method 
of planting potatoes, which, from accurate and repeated ex- 
periments in foil not fuperior to the average of Great Bri- 
tain, w ill, on a moderate computation, yield 24 s. per acre 
more than the method recommended by the moft approved 
writers on farming. He has with fuccefs applied peat duft, 
and roots of kail and cabbage, as manure to the potatoes ; 
and he has contrived a harrow for the purpofes of the horfe- 
hoeing hufbandry, by which the furface can be fmoothed, 
and weeds dertroyed, without levelling the rows. He has 
likewi'e invented a plough, the fock of which is fo formed 
as to render a coulter, (once thought fo efiential), with all 
its train of plates and wedges, an ufelefs incumbrance. He 
has nKde improvements, too, on the curved mould-board 
and the chain-muzzle.

preparing and leading it, which is fo great a hindrance to , 
the bufinefs of farming, with the diftrefs occafioned by the 
frequent difficulty, or rather impoffibility, of preparing it 
properly in fo rainy a climate, render it highly defirable that 
the partial and oppreffive tax on coals were repealed. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The circumftances advan- 
tageous to the parifli are its good roads, its eafy communi- 
cation with other parts, by means of the two lochs of Eaft 
and Weft Tarbert, and the weekly packets from them to 
the low country and the Weftern Ifles, with the arrival of a 
poft three times a week ; fea-ware, banks of oyfter-fhells and 
fhell-fand, abundance of limeftone, and the frequent vifits 
made by the herrings. The difadvantages the parifh labours 
under are, the fcarcity of fait to cure the herrings, and of 
coal to burn the limeftone ; — the want of uniformity of 
weights and meafures, hurtful to the ignorant, and inconve- 
nient to the beft informed •, — the want of leafes in fume 
cafes, the fhortnefs of them in others, and the many bur- 
thenfome claufes with which they are clogged ; — but princi- 
pally the high rents, which are beyond all proportion to the 
prefent ftate of improvement in the country. Thefe difad- 
vantages occafioned the people to emigrate in great numbers 
to America, before our unfortunate difpute with that coun- 
try, and in fmaller numbers even fince that period. The 
fpirit of emigration has again begun to appear amongft them, 
(fee the decreafe in the population within thefe 10 years paft, 
by the ftatiftical table) ; and, from their murmurs and com- 
plaints, it is probable it will foon arrive at fuch a height, that 
the evil complained of will cure itfelf, both here and in other 
parts of the Highlands, though not till it has drained the

nation of many inhabitants, and of a confequent proportion 
of its opulence and importance. All the plans that have 
been hitherto propofed for the relief of thefe unfortunate 
people, will be of little avail towards ameliorating their con- 
dition, while the landed proprietors enjoy an unlimited power 
of railing their rents. Would a ftatute, regulating the rent 
of lands, be a greater infringement on the rights of the fub- 
je£l, than the regulation of the affize of bread, or the rate of 
intereft ?

Explanation of, and Supplement to, the Statijlical Table. 

With regard to marriages, when parties belong to two dif- 
ferent parilhes, it is required by law that they be regtftered 
in both. It will be neceffary, therefore, for the perufer of 
the ftatiftical accounts of Scotland to obferye, that the fame 
marriage is frequently returned from two different parifhes, 
being extracted from the parilh regifters, and that calcula- 
tions founded on thefe returns mult lead to erroneous con- 
cha fions. 

The female day-labourers are fuch of the widows in the 
foregoing lift as are able to work, and can procure employ- 
ment. They get for fhearing 6 d. per day, befides victuals,, 
and for fpinning 2d. "When they fpin in their own houfes, 
they get 46. for 12 cuts, or a hafp, which is reckoned a 
day's fpinning. 

There is no regifter of deaths or burials kept in the parilh. 
The burying-grounds are many, and widely diftant from each 
other. The general height of the people is 5 feet 8 inches s 
there are fome above 6 feet high. 

All the parifhioners are farmers, excepting thofe that are 
otherwife defigned in the ftatiftical table •, and even thefe are 
fo upon a fmall fcale, as they all rent a little land. Such of 
them as may be called manufacturers, as weavers, &amp;c. do not 
manufacture for exportation. As the ftatiftical table was 
made up before the commencement of the harveft quarter, 
at which time fervants are hired for fhearing, 6k-c. the great-

eft part of the farm fervants mentioned in it are thofe cm. 
ployed in herding. Some of thele are cottagers, who, with 
their families, are employed in herding in the larger farms. 
The reft are boys and girls, refiding in the families of the 
farmers. The cottagers get, for wages, a houfe, a cow's 
grafs, potatoe land, and as much meal or money as will make 
their wages equal to that of the male farm-fervants refiding 
5n the families of their matters, which, including victuals, is 
from 1 2 1. to 1 4 1. per annum. The boys and girls get from 
•24 s. to 50 s. per annum, according to their age, and the 
trouble of herding. 

The farmers, befides having their own families conftantly 
employed in the bufinefs of the farm, have hired fervants 
during the harvefl: quarter. They are fed in the families of 
the farmers ; and the wages of the women, during that peri- 
od, is from 25s. to 30s.; and of the men, about 40s. 
They come moftly from the Weftern Iflands, and from the 
northern diftricts of the country. The greater part of the 
young perfons belonging to the parifh, who are not of the 
families of the farmers, or not employed by their parents in 
farming, feek for fervice in the neighbouring parts of the low 
country, at the cotton works, and other manufactures. Many 
of the young men are feamen employed in veffcls belonging 
to the pariah, or to the ports of Rothfay, Campbeltoun, and 
Greenock. The prices of provifions are not materially dif- 
ferent from thofe at Greenock, the communication between 
the two places being regular and eafy. This circumftance, 
too, determines the wages of carpenters, mafons, &amp;c. The 
clockmaker mentioned in the table is 92 years of age. He 
cn joys great health and activity for his years, and can travel 
rnanv miles in a day, to repair the clocks and watches of the 
parilhioners. To the fcanty and precarious fubfiftence this 
affords, he is obliged to add by begging.

( County and Prefbytery of Linlithgow.— Synod of Lo- 
thian and Tweeddale.J 

By Air John Muckarsie, Afjiflant to the Reverend Mr 

James Lindsay.</head> 



<p>Extent, Name, CJTV. 

nPHE parifh of Kirkliftoun is divided by the river Al- 
mond into two parts, the eaftern divifion (which is 
about one fourth of the whole) lying in the county of Mid- 
Lothian, and the weftern in the county of Linlithgow. The 
parifh is Of a form extremely irregular ; but the length may 
be 5! miles, and the average breadth 34 miles. The ancient 
nahie of the parifh was Temple Lifton. Liofton, according 
to an eminent antiquarian lately deceafed *, fignifies, in the 
Celtic, an inclofure on the fide of a river. This compound, 
in progrefs of time, may have been contracted into Liftoun, 
of which name there are feveral places in this parifh ; Hall- 
lifton, Oldlifton, Newlifton, Ilifton or Highliftou, and Kirk- 
lifton, the latter being the name of the village in which the 
church is placed, as well as of the whole parifh. The pro- 
bability of this conjecture is ftrengthened from a circular 
mound of earth, of great antiquity, furrounded with large

iinpolifhed ftones, at a confiderable diftance from each other^ 
evidently intended in memory of fome remarkable event. 
Tradition, however, relates, that a family of the name of 
Lijlon pofleffed great property in this neighbourhood ; and it 
may ftill appear doubtful whether the place derived its name 
from the family, or the family from the place. 

Soil, Produce, £ffr. — The foil varies from a ftrong clay to 
a rich black mould, the only exceptions being a few haughs, 
(evidently formed by the changing of the river's courfe), 
compofed of a light earth and deep fand. In a few places, 
the clay land is extremely wet, and difficult to labour ; but 
the whole of the parifh is arable, and has been, for time im- 
memorial, under tillage. 

Wheat, barley, oats, peafe, beans, hay, potatoes, yams, and 
a few turnips, are the'ordinary produce. The average quan- 
tity of the firit five may be from 7 to 8 bolls, Linlithgow 
rneafure, the Scotch acre ; but it is not uncommon to have, 
rn the moft fertile places, 12 and 14 bolls. From the pre- 
fent high ftate of cultivation, it is evident that attention to 
agriculture was early introduced ; and it is a well attefted 
fact, that Lord Stair was the firft in Scotland to plant tur- 
nips and cabbages in the open fields. All the lands in the 
parifh have been long ago enriched with lime ; and many 
attempts were made, though with lefs fuccels, to lime a fe- 
cond and a third time with increafed quantities. Every 
common expedient has been alfo employed to increafe the 
quantity of dung ; and fome of the farmers have carried 
their (peculations not only to the rotation from black to 
white crops,- but alfo to varying the different crops in the 
rotation. 

The manner of ploughing is with two horfes, without any 
affiftance from oxen. The ploughs are after* Small's con-

ftruaion.— The farms, in general, are not large. Excepting 
3 or 4, which may contain from 300 to 500 acres, they run 
from 1 00 to 200 acres. The increafing defire of accumula- 
ting this kind of property, has not operated to a very great 
extent for 50 years paft. One farm of 500 acres prefently 
maintains, in connexion with it, families confifting of 47

* The difadvantage to population by the accumulation of 
farms, muft arife chiefly from the habit and capacity of doing 
more work with fewer hands ; and even this to a whole nation 
may be leffened by the reduction in the price of grain, from an 
additional quantity in the market. But the chief difadvantage 
of this ruinous and prevailing practice arifes not fo much from its 
effects on population, as in changing manners and habits. It 
deftroys the balance, in point of numbers, between matters and 
fervants, and produces a confiderable effect on the fpirit and in- 
dependence of a whole nation. The evil may be lamented ; but, 
during the ftate of rapidly increafing cultivation, where a capi- 
tal is required, and where the knowledge of the buhuefs is con- 
fined, there can be little hopes of a cure. In a general and 
high ftate of cultivation, however, when the exigence of a fa- 
mily will become of importance, and the labour of it procure 
the means, when fuperiority in the art will only conflft in clofe 
attention, when perfons of this character will be able to afford 
the higheft price for land ; and finally, when there (hall be no 
extraordinary demand for men to the other departments of civil 
fociety, this evil will naturally ceafe to exift. It it to the local 
and partial operations of thofe principles, that we muft afcribe 
the general equality and moderation of farms in this parifh ; 
and, if thefe were univerfal, the facts would more certainly 
follow. In the mean time, though the proprietors of land are 
excufable in adopting the be-ft method of bringing their proper- 
ty, in the fpeedieft manner, to the greateft value ; yet have they 
it much in their power, without interrupting the general plan, 
to prevent the inconveniency. A few acres, lying contiguous 
to the villages, divided among the inhabitants, would greatly 
attach them to the foil, by giving them a property and exis- 
tence in the country. It would better their condition, and in- 
creafe their numbers, by blending together the characlers oi 
the mechanic and hufbandmen ; and, far from diminifhing, it 
would add to the value of land.

to their knowledge of the bufinefs. The farm-houfes in this 
parifh are extremely commodious, and even elegant. Th^y 
confift of two floors, befides garrets, are covered with blue 
and grey flate, and are in all refpedts fuperior to the genera- 
lity of country manfes. 

CharaBer ana 1 Manners. — With the exception of a few 
families, the whole people may be divided into two clafics* 
farmers compofing the one, and mechanics and fervants the 
other. The former being almoft wholly on the fame level, 
live together in the moft intimate habits of frieua'hip and 
hofpitality. From the increafing civilization of manners, 
the fafhion of the times, and other accidental caufes, they 
have, within the laft 40 years, entirely departed from the 
pernicious cuftom of having their meetings for bufinefs or 
amufement in the public-houfes of the parifh. They now 
aflemble together in the family ftile, and conduct their enter- 
tainments with the fobriety and delicacy becoming family 
manners. The morals of the common people have conti- 
nued nearly in the fame footing for many years. The only 
facl which conftitutes a difference between the people of this 
rank in this and the greater number of country parifiies in 
Scotland, is the extreme difficulty of rifing above their hum- 
ble condition. The equality of the farms, and the want of 
manufactures, afford no hope to fervants and mechanics of 
becoming mafters in their feveral profefiions. By this means, 
while the induftry of the people is not materially affected, 
the defire of accumulating money is fcarcely known *. Hi- 
therto 

* The time, however, does not feem to be far diftant, when 
the ambition for gaiety will give place to habits of intempe- 
rance. It is utterly impoffible that fpirits can remain at their 
prefent price, (about 3 s. the Engl.fh gallon in retail), without 
becoming the beverage of the comnion people. About 20 ars

ago, in this parifh and neighbourhood, there were feven brew- 
eries, where at prefent there are only two ; and each of the feven 
brought more ale to the market than both the prefent ones do. 
It is evident, that, in the fame period, the confumption of fpi- 
rits mult have proportionally increafed ; and it is an indifpu- 
table fadt, that the ufe of fpirituous liquors gives the profpeft 
of unlimited excefs. The progrefs towards this horrid ftate is 
more imperceptible in the country than in large towns ; be- 
caufe, in the latter, the daily, and even hourly, price of labour, 
fuppl'es the conftant means ; and, in the former, fobriety is, in 
all cafes, a more important recommendation ; but the habit of 
drinking fpirits will finally overcome every fentiment of honour 
and ambition in the human character. It muft be allowed at 
the fame time, that the depravity of the individual may be the 
temporary riches of the ftate, when depravity is the fubjedl of 
taxation; but no man of integrity would defire to fee a rich 
Exchequer, and a weak, enervated, and debauched people. 
Nothing can be of the fmalleft fervice for the cure of this evil, 
but that which effectually raifes the price of fpirits, and makes 
ale a more palatable and fubftantial beverage.

From this table, it appears that there are 44. perfons to a 
family, and that the proportions betwixt males and females 
is as 8 of the former to 9 of the latter. It is prefumed that 
every other ufeful proportion connected with population 
may be deduced from this table. The vaft difproportion be- 
tween the numbers in the families of the farmers and of the 
cottagers, may be partly accounted for by the latter being 
obliged to fend their children fooner into the world, and the 
fervants employed by the former. The return to Dr Webfter 
in 1755 was 1461 fouls. The average of baptifms for 11 
years preceding 1790, is 48 ; of thefe the proportion of males 
to females is as 8 of the former to 5 of the latter. The ac- 
curacy of the records, however, cannot altogether be depend- 
ed on ; and of thofe children which are not inferted, the 
probability is, that the greatest number are females. The 
average of marriages during the forementioned 1 1 years, is 
ni ; and of the deaths, no accurate account can be given.

guifhed for enterprize and capacity in the field, and for wif- 
dom in the cabinet, inherited from his mother the eftate 
of Newlifton in this parifli, where he refided for 20 years 
fubfequent to his recall from his embalTy at Paris in 1720, 
and feems to have bellowed much attention on his maternal 
inheritance. The pleafure grounds, nearly three miles- irr cir- 
tumference, are entirely after his defign, covered with trees 
of his planting, and adorned with artificial lakes. Although 
his military ideas have evidently entered into every part of 
the plan, yet the extent of the whole prevents any bad effect, 
and Newlifton may be confidered as a moft delightful place. 
He died here in 1747, and was buried in Kirklifton church, 
without a monument to point out the fpot where he lies *. 

Rent. — The valued rent can eafily be afcertained from the 
cefs-books ; and of the real rent it is impofflble to make any 
juft calculation. There feems to have been great changes of 
landholders here as in all the parilhes in Scotland. About 
7 old manfion-houfes, belonging to as many different pro- 
prietors, have, within a century, been converted into farm- 
houfes, or gone to ruins, as inconvenient or unfit for that 
purpofe. A property in this parifli, confifting of 161 acres,

thefe lands was 181 1. ; and they were fold for 4052 1. 10 s. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — The church of Kirkliftoun was one of 
thofe belonging to the Knights Hofpitallers of St John of 
Jerufalem, who had large poffeflions in this parifh at the 
time of the Reformation. 

JDifeafes. — For time immemorial, no putrid fever, nor pleu- 
rify, nor inflammation of the throat, nor fever of any kind, 
have been epidemical in this parifh. There have been, of 
late, frequent inftances of one or other of thefe difeafes ex- 
tremely fatal and common in the neighbouring pariflies, 
while the inhabitants of this have altogether efcaped. This, 
perhaps, may be accounted for from local fituation. About 
60 years ago, the ague was a common difeafe j but there is 
now fcarcely an inftance of it m the parifh. At the fame 
time, there is no remarkable inftances of longevity. There 
are, perhaps, 5 or 6 above 80, but none who have reached 
90. The difeafes of children are, in general, extremely 
mild ; and nearly one half of the inhabitants practife inocu- 
lation. The only eftimate of deaths in the parifh is that 
which is fupplied by the accounts of money received for the

We are informed by Buchanan and other hidorians, that there 
was a bloody battle fought near this place, on the banks of the 
Almond, in the year 995, between Kennethus, natural brother, 
and commander of the iorces of Malcolm II. King of Scotland, 
and Conftantine, the ufurper of that crown, wherein both the 
generals were killed. About two miles higher up the river on 
the Bathgate road, is the circular mound of earth formerly . 
mentioned. The whole intermediate fpace, from the human 
bones dug up, and graves of unpolifhed Hones difcovered below 
the furface, feems to have been the fcene of many battles. 
This is rendered probable from the importance of the fituation, 
as the firft opening after the Carle of Stirling, from the North 
and Weft Highlands, to the richer places, of Scotland.

the fupport of the poor. They are not fuflkiently accurate 
for any purpofe, but that of ftating a proportion to eftablifh 
the fact with regard to epidemical difeafes. In 72 years, a 
period which ought nearly to comprehend all the varieties of 
feafon, the number of burials, where the mort-cloth is ufed, 
are from 8 to 14, with the exception of 20 for one year. 

State of the Poor. — The funds of the poor in this parifh 
nrife from the collections at the church-door ; from the 
mort-cloth •, from the letting of feats in the area of the 
church ; from the interest of a bond for 200 I. ; and from 
occafional afTefTments. The following is the amount of the 



funds for 10 years.

In the year 1782, the indufirious poor were provided for 
by a voluntary fubfcription ; and the money was diftributed 
by a committee of fubfcribers. The fum raifed in this man- 
ner was upwards of 80 1. This circuniftance prevented any 
alteration in the funds or the lift for that year. The private 
charities (if what is given regularly for a continuance of years 
deferves no better name) are fo coniiderable and extenfive 
as to render the above ftatement inadequate to the actual 
number of poor in the parifh.

( Prejbytery of Jedburgh. — Synod of Merfe and Tiviot-

By the Reverend Mr Benjamin Dickison.</head> 



<p>JSxtent, Appearance, CSV. 

THE parifh of Kirktoun extends in length about 8 miles 
from E. to W. and in breadth betwixt i and 2, from 
N. to S. Though without any diftinguifhed mountains, the 
face of the country prefents a continued range of hills, fepa- 
rated only by Imall rivulets, and gradually afcending from 
E. to W. The foil, in general, is dry, light, and fhallow, 
with a bottom of hard or fhelly rock, and productive of nu- 
tritive grafs, even to the fummits of the hills. Though evi- 
dently deftined by nature, and, in its prefent unfheltered ftate, 
fit for pafturage alone, a confiderable proportion of the land 
is kept in tillage, and fown with oats, peafe, and bear, though 
without any regular rotation. The produce, at an average, 
is lefs than 3 after 1, and much inferior in quality to that 
which was fown. Potatoes and turnips are planted to a fmall 
extent, and cultivated with fuccefs. The different kinds of 
clover and grafs feeds have been tried ; but, in general, from 
want of fhelter and defence againft pafturage at improper 
feafons, have either not fprung at all, or been deftroyed by 
the winter frofts and ftorms. Attempts have been made, 

and 



of KirktoUtt, /jg 

and ftiH are making, to meliorate the grain, and increafe the 
quantity, by the modern plans of hufoandry, with lime, marl^ 
and fallowing, the effect of which, however, in this unpropi- 
tious foil and climate, is only a greater quantity of firaw. 
The reafon the farmers afcribe for this unprofitable train of 
culture, is the neceffity they lie under of providing winter 
food for their cattle. Thefe indeed, and fheep, are, and 
ought to be, the great objecl: of their attention, as the prin- 
cipal, and, at prefent, almoft the only fource of lubfiftence 
and wealth. 



Manners of the Inhabitants, cffV. — Neither the records of 
the parifh, the monuments of antiquity, nor the cuftoms and 
morals of the mhabitants, exhibit any objecl particularly 
meriting the attention of the philofopher, the politician, or 
the moralift, unlefs this, which, though not a Angular, is 
rather an uncommon fact, that its hiftory, for ages paft, may, 
with the ftrifteft regard to truth, be comprehended in a few- 
words, " One generation paffeth and another comet b." 

There is here neither town nor village. Annexed to each 
farm-ftead are a few cottages, reared, in general, of turf and 
ftone. The inhabitants are poor and indolent, contented 
and frugal. The indigent, to the number of 12 or 13, are 
fupported by a poor's rate, levied equally upon the landlords 
and tenants, and the collections in church, amounting in all 
to about 30 1. per annum, which fo fully fupplies the needy, 
that there is not an itinerant beggar in the parifh. From 
the purity of the air, and the temperance of the inhabitants, 
fewer difeafes prevail here than in any fpot of Scotland per- 
haps of the fame extent. Agues, rheumatifms, and con- 
fumptions, are the moft frequent. Wine is only feen at fu- 
nerals, whiflcy at weddings ; and, in 2 or 3 houfes excepted, 
ale is a ftranger. 

Markets.

Markets^ &amp;c. — The nearcft market town is Hawick, about 
3 miles diftant, where vivres are fold nearly at the fame rate 
as in Edinburgh. The great road from Edinburgh to New- 
caftle, by Selkirk and Hawick, palfes through the middle of 
this parifh ; one of the great advantages of which to this 
neighbourhood, is the opening up an ealy accefs, over the 
border mountains, to the coal-mines in the weft parts of 
Northumberland. Thefe and the peat-mofles, with which 
the country abounds, furnifh abundant, though expenfive 
fuel. There are veftiges of fome wood ; but, at prelent, not 
a tree, and fcarcely a bum is to be feen in the parHh.

procefs of reduction before the Court of Teinds. The Crown 
is patron, and titular of the teinds. The glebe contains abeot 
5 acres. The manfe was built about 30 years ago, and lately 
repaired. The church is an old, incommodious, pitiful edi- 
fice, not fufficient to contain a third qf the inhabitants, fmaU 
as their number is.

with ftrict oeconomy accomplifti. 

Mifcellaneous Ofyirvotions.— Though both foil and climate, 
in their prefent flate, are unpropitious to improvements, 
there is no doubt that the modern plans of hufbandry might 
be carried on with fuccefs. To do this, the moft likely me- 
thod would be to plant wood, in fuch proportions and direc- 
tions as might moft effectually break the violence of ftorms, 
and thereby prevent the roots of the young plants from being 
torn up or broken, and the ripened grain from being fhaken 
out. For poor grain, and unproductive crops, are more ow- 
ing to the autumnal winds, than either to poverty of foil, or 
feverity of climate. This would neceffarily lead to the ma- 
king of inclofures, the advantages of which are well known 
to every farmer in the more cultivated parts of the country. 
Befides the improvement and increafe of grain, and the me- 
lioration of fummer pafture, by the young grafs and clover 
being faved and fheltered in winter, abundance of better food 
might be raifed for the winter fubfiftence of fheep and cattle, 
and a fuperior breed of both might be thus introduced, to 
the great emolument both of landlord and tenant. 

It is furprifing, that the proprietors here practife fo little 
the elegant and permanent improvement of wood and inclo- 
fure, efpecially as they feem, in other refpects, well difpofed 
to encourage their tenants in meliorating the grounds, and 
increafmg the quantity and value of the productions, by pur- 
chafing manure, and making of roads.</p>

By the Reverend Mr Hugh CunynGHAME.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, cirY. 

TRANENT is generally fuppofed to be a corruption of 
Trinity ; and the form of the church is alledged as a 
proof of the derivation *. 

This parifh is bounded by the Frith of Forth on the N. ; 
is about 6 miles in length, from N. E. to S. W. ; and its 
greateft breadth is 3 miles. The great eaft road runs through 
the town, and divides the parifh into nearly two equal parts. 
The land towards the fea is inferior in quality to none in 
Scotland, renting generally from 40 s. to 50 s. per acre, tho' 

a 

* In the charters of St David to the Abbey of Holyrood- 
houfe, it appears the name of this parifh was formerly Traver- 
nent ; for mention is made of one Thoraldus de Travernent, 
i. e. Tranent. Admitting this, the idea of Trinity is deftroy- 
ed ; and reference leems rather, according to the Latin, to be 
had to failing, which correfponds with a tradition ft ill extant in 
the oppofite coaft of Fife, that a party of Danes once landed on 
their ftiore, but were fuddenly obliged to feek refuge in their 
boats, and put to fea. The cry of the exulting natives was 
Tranent, or Travernent, Let them fail over, or right acrofs. Ac- 
cordingly, they landed in this parifh, from which circumflance 
it had the name. 



Siaiijlical Account 



a few fetch more. The land to the S. of the pofl: road, 
though the greateft part of it be of a good quality, lets at a 
rate confiderably lower. The whole of the parifh is arable. 
There are, however, upwards of 100 acres of common, and a 
considerable portion of link ground, ftill in a ftate of nature. 
Improved muir lets at 15 s. and 20 s. per acre ; inclofed and 
cultured links at 36 s. and 40 s. The high rent of thefe 
lands is owing to the peculiar advantages of their fituation. 
The face of the country is remarkably pleafant, riling by a 
gentle afcent from the fea to the fouthermoft extremity of 
the parilh. The town of Tranent commands an extenfive 
view of the adjacent country, the Frith of Forth, and the 
oppofite fhore *. 

Property and Agriculture. — The parifh is divided amongfr 
9 greater, and nearly double that number of fmaller, proprie- 
tors. Three of the firft either ftatedly or occafionally refide, 
and moft of the latter. The valued rent of the parilh ex- 
ceeds 10,900 1. Scotch ; and the real rent, inclufive of houfes 
and gardens, 6000 1. Sterling f. There are in the parifh 3 
farmers who rent above 300 1. — 5 above 200 1. — 4 above* 
100 1. — 8 above 50 1. — and 17 above 20, — befides a grea: 
number pofleffing from 40 to 5 acres, or under. 

Agriculture 

* The climate is exceedingly good, and the air healthy and 
dry. The town of Tranent has long been reputed particularly 
healthy. Intermittent fevers, in particular, are feldom known. 
Inoculation being little pracHfed, the imall-pox is frequent. 
The year 1792 is, however, an exception to the general healthi- 
nefs of the place. An epidemical fever, of a putrid nature, 
prevailed upwards of 10 months, and carried off a great num- 
ber in the prime of life. 

\ Houfes and gardens were rated a few years ago at 425 1. 
8 s. 9 d. Deducing this from the 6coo 1. the remainder, 35.75 !•• 
will be nearly the rent of the land, _ 



of Tranent. 8^ 

.Agriculture in this parifh is, in general, in the fame 
jlourifhing ftate that charafterifes Eaft Lothian at large. 
The great proportion of acres poflefTed by people who take 
land from necefiity and convenience, makes the proper ma- 
nagement of it but a fecondary object.

No value is put upon 423. acres of pafture. The quantity of 
turnips raifed here is trifling , and' no lint is fown but for 
private ufe. If for thefe articles, a fum, not exceeding 400 1, 
is added to the preceding table, the total amount, 13,300 k 
will be nearly the annual produce of the parifh. The late, 
invention of threfhing-mills feems to have met with the ap- 
probation of the farmers, there being already 4 of them in 
the parifh.

forms the boundary of the parifh for nearly 2 miles. There 
is one fmall harbour at Port Seton, which, previous to the 
Union, was a place of confiderable refort, being the neareft 
port to Preftonpans, whofe merchants had upwards of 20 
veflels belonging to them. At prefent, the (hipping is con- 
fined to a few eaft country and coafting veffels. The imports 
are timber and iron, and fometimes corn and malt, for the 
accommodation of neighbouring diftilleries. The chief, if 
not the only export, is fait. The more-dues feldom exceed 
30 1. 

A manufacture of great fait, of a very particular fine quali- 
ty, was eftablilhed here a few years ago by Dr Schwediaur ; 
but, from various circumftances, the fcheme totally failed. 
In Cockenzie, which connects with this village, the manu- 
facture of common fait is carried on to great advantage and 
extent, 10 or 11 pans being conftantly at work. The inter- 
nal refource of coal which the proprietor enjoys, gives a de- 
cided fuperiority over every other perfon, who muft either 
import his coals, or purchafe them from the neareft coal- 
mafter. 

Off the coaft, there is a confiderable oyfter-fcalp ; but, of 
late years, the oyfters have become very fcarce. This muft 
be attributed to over-dragging feveral years ago, to fupply 
Englifh vefTels from Milton, Lee, and other places. Before 
this, a boat would fometimes drag 9000 a day, which, at 5 d. 
6d. and 7 d. a hundred, afforded a handfome income to the 
crew. The common average lay betwixt 4000 and 7000. 
At prefent, 700 or 800 are reckoned a good day's work, 
which, though now fold indifcriminately at 15 d. ^/-hun- 
dred, afford but a fcanty livelihood when divided amongft 
5 men, including a double deal to the owner of the boar. 
There are at prefent 1 o boats, belonging to Cockenzie and 
Port Seton, engaged in this fifhing. Upwards of 20,000 

oyfters 



of Tranent, 



8 7 



oyfters go regularly each feafon to the Glafgow market *. 
Few or no white fifh have been taken off the coaft for feve- 
ral years. Haddocks, in particular, have become a great 
rarity. Whitings and flounders, at prefent, fell on the fhore 
at 2 s. 6 d. per fcull, (containing about 6 or 7 dozen), which, 
a few years ago, would not have brought above one third of 
that price. 

The moft confiderable diftillery now in Scotland, belong- 
ing to Aitchifon, Brown, and Co. is carried on at St Cle- 
ments Wells, in this parifh. From this work alone, Go- 
vernment receives about 4000 1. of revenue yearly. There was 
originally a fmall ftill ufed here j but, by the fpirited exer- 
tions of the prefent Company, it has attained to its prefent 
flourifhing ftate. Coal is conveniently fituated in a park ad- 
joining to the work. The feam is about 2 feet thick, at the 
depth only of 15 fathoms, and the coal coft the work at the 
rate of 5 s. per ton. 900 Cattle, and 300 fwine, are annually 
fed at the work. In thefe different branches, the feeding of 
cattle, diftilling, and working of coal, about 120 hands are 
employed. 

At Cockenzie is an annual fair, held the firft Thurfday of 
November, which, like moft of the country fairs, owing to 
the extenfion of commerce, is much on the decline. For- 
merly, cattle were brought to this market ; now, undrefled 
lint of home growth is the chief article of traffic, and feldom 
exceeds the price of 2 s. per ftone. In Tranent is a good 
butcher market twice a week, from which Preftonpans, Or- 
rnifton, and the adjacent country, are principally fupplied. 
In 1791, about 250 oxen, 70 calves, and 1350 fheep and 

lambs, 

* The demand from Glafgow has not been fo great this 
year ; but fome of the boats have found a ready market, and 
good price at Newcaftle, to which they have performed feve- 
ral trips during the harveft months.

lambs, were killed by the different butchers. There is here 
alfo a confiderable tannery, and a fmall manufaclur of locks 
and nails. A good many looms are employed in the parifb, 
but chiefly for private ufe, though a few do what is called 
factory work. One only weaves muflin. 

Collieries. — Befides the fmall feam of coal already mention- 
ed, wrought for the fupply of the diftillery, there are oricr 
3 collieries in the parilh, Tranent, Elphingfton, and Bull :y. 
The beft feam is that of Elphingfton, being no l°f- thap 9 
feet thick, at the depth of 32 and 25 fathoms, according to 
the afcent and defcent of the furface. Below this is a feam 
about 5 feet thick ; and there are different fmall ftrata above, 
at prefent not wprth the working.

It is reckoned, that at thefe different collieries, including 
bearers, overfeers, gin ? men, and bank-men, about 150 hands 
are employed ; and, if the great number of cinder- burners 
are taken into the account, it is evident that a confiderable 
proportion of the parifhioners either belong to, or are con- 
nected with, the collieries. The influence they have in 
forming the manners of the lower clafles, is of courfe confi- 
derable; and, according to their frugal or extravagant way of 
life, the poor's funds are more or lefs burdened.

EccleftajTical State.— The church is a very ancient, incom- 
modious, and unhealthy fabric. No account of its antiquity 
is any where to be found ; but mod people fkilled in archi- 
tecture have little hefitation in pronouncing it 500 or 600 
years old. The outward form refembles 3 oblong buildings, 
placed fideways, the middle being confiderably longer at each 



of Tranent. 



end than the other two. The communication within is by 
arches of different forms and fizes. A fquare tower rifes 
from the centre of the whole, fupported by the fide walls of 
tj-ie middle building, and by two crofs arches. The roof is 
vaulted, and covered with ftone. The windows are few, and 
ill conftrucled ; and, in a dark and gloomy day, ferve only to 
make « darknefs vifible." Either the church has originally 
been funk below the furface of the ground, or the furround- 
ing burying-ground has been much heightened by the im~ 
menfe number of bodies interred in it ; for the accefs to the 
pulpit is by a defcent of 4 fteps from the church-yard. 

The manfe is large, and well executed, and was built in 
1 78 1. The ftipend confifts of 27 bolls of wheat, 26 bolls of 
barley, 43 bolls of oats, 500 1. Scotch, including 60 1. for 
communion elements, befides a glebe of nearly 6 acres, and 
fomewhat more than an acre of muir, the minifter's propor- 
lion of the divifion of a commonty. The King is patron, in 
confequence of the attainder of the Earl of Wintoun. The 
prefent incumbents are, the Reverend Mr Charles Cunin^f 
ham, fettled in 1740, and the Reverend Hugh Cunynghame, 
ordained affiftant and fucceffor in 1784. Befides the two 
eftablifhed clergymen, there is a minifter of the Burgher 
perfuafion *. 

Population 

* Schools. — The falary of the parifh fchoolmafter is only 7 1, 
and fome odd (hillings ; but what with the dues arifing from 
the feflion and heritors clerkfhips, from the offices of precentor 
collector of road-money and poor's rates, and the profits of the 
fchool, the amount is confiderabie. The prefent mailer is bur. 
dened with an annuity of 20 1. to his predeceflbr, who refigned. 
The heritors, fenfible of the inconvenience and hardfliip cf the 
bargain to a young man of merit, with a riling family, eene- 
rouily and voluntarily added 5 1. per annum to the falary, built 
a new fchool, and fitted up the mailer's houfe in a manner com-

at the parifh fchool may be from 60 to 80. School wages are 
paid weekly, which is a bar to the regular attendance of the 
children ; for many parents, having occafion for their children 
at home in the beginning of a week, through a miftaken and 
ill-direfted parfimony, keep them from fchool all the reft of it. 

There are at prefent 7 other fchools in the parilh, 4 of which 
are taught by men, the remaining three by women. None of 
them have any falary except one, voluntarily paid by the pro- 
prietors of the ground and the refiding partner at St Clements 
Wells. About 70 fcholars attend it in lummer. At the diffe- 
rent fchools in the parifh, in fummer 1791, about 220 fcholars 
were taught. There are befides, two Sabbath evening cateche- 
tical exerciles ; one fupported by an annual collection at the 
church-doors, the other upon the ellablifhment of the Society 
in Scotland for promoting religious knowledge amongft the 
poor. 

* The increafe of population betwixt 1783 and 1 79 1 was 
owing to the fale of the ellates of the York Buildings Company 
in this pariih, the purchafers thereof feuing fmall fpots for 
houfes and gardens j to the enlargement of a diftillery ; and to 
a new colliery.

* A very accurate regifter was kept ef the births and buri- 
als of the pariftiioners until the year 1784, when the tax upon 
recording them was impofed, which many perfons refufed to 
pay, and therefore omitted making any entry. The record, 
confequently, became imperfect in this, as well as in many other 
parifhes in Scotland. 

The regifter before mentioned contains all the deaths of pa- 
riftiioners, though buried in a different parifh, all included in 
the following tables : it likewife contains the deaths of a confi- 
derable number dying in adjacent parifhes, and buried in Tra- 
nent, and children at nurfe fent from other places; but thefc 
are not included in the tables.

Of the males ftated as having died at 93, three, and of the 
females at 96, three alfo, were alive ; but thefe are of no confe- 
quence in forming a table. In every other refpeft, it is made 
to correfpond with the deaths mentioned in Table 1 . 

From the foregoing Tables, it appears probable that the emi- 
gration of males is chiefly between the ages of 25 and 37, and 
of females between the ages of 18 and 28. Until the emigra- 
tion is completed, the probabilities of the duration of life are 
by the Tables always too low, and, before it commences, very 
confiderably fo. 

The fmall-pox, in the natural way, very frequently makes 
great ravages among the younger children, efpecially when at- 
tended with the hooping cough.

ing the number of emigrants to the radices for each year, till 
the emigration commences, and afterwards deducting, along 
with the deaths, the proportion of emigrations thought neareft the

The effects of the year 1782 are evident from the above 
Statement. The parifli funds bore the whole of the burden ; 
and, confidering the high price of oat-meal, (is. 6d. per 
peck), the additional and unavoidable expence of thefe years 
feems extremely moderate. All the inconveniencies of that 
memorable year feem now to be over \ and, notwithstanding 
the increafed population of the parifh, there is reafon to be- 
lieve, the expenditure to the poor will be confiderably lower 
than for many years previous to 1782. This hope is found- 
ed on the good effects (already felt) of the different charitable 
jnftitutions belonging to the reipective trades of the parifli 
and neighbourhood. There are four of thefe focieties, or 
boxes, as they are called, in the parifli, and a great number of 
people connected with others at a diftance. It is a fact 
worth mentioning, that although, by the fatal fever of the 
current year 1792, upwards of 30 fatherlefs children, and a 
proportionable number of poor widows, are in great meafure 
•eft deftitute, not a Angle application from that quarter has 
as yet been made for public charity f. 

Mifcellaneaus 

* The increafed expence for the current year, 1792, is owing 
to a greater number of occafional poor in diflrefs, the ftated 
penfion lift being confiderably lower than that of laft year. 

+ The moft ancient place in the parifli, fo far as known, is 
St Germans, now the feat of David Anderfon, Efquire. There

* Mifcellaneous Obfervations.—Thc battle of Prefton, in 1745, 
was fought partly in this parifh, the fcene of action lying 
about half a mile to the north of the church. The remains 
of the gallant Chriftian hero, Colonel Gardiner, who died in 
the minifter's houfe of the wounds he received in the field, 
lie interred in the weft end of the church. 

The poft road running through the parifh is an evident 
advantage, as thereby an eafy communication with the me- 
tropolis, on the one hand, and Haddington, the be ft corn 
market in the kingdom, on the other, is opened. The near- 
nefs, and confequent cheapnefs, of coal, is an acknowledged 
convenience to the phce, though the fcarcity of water is an 
effectual bar to manufactures that owe much of their fuccefs 
to the low price and plenty of fuel. There is but one fpring 

to 

was here an hofpital, but by whom founded is uncertain, la 
Ragman's roll, mention is made of Batthelmu Mejlre dt la mefon 
de St Germen, anno 1296. In later times, St Germans belong- 
ed to the Knights Templars, but was, with moft of its reve- 
nues, bellowed by King James IV. upon the King's College of 
Aberdeen in 1494. 

At Seton was a collegiate church, founded for a provoft, 6 
prebendaries, 2 finging boys, and a clerk, out of feveral chap- 
lainries united for that efFecl by George Lord Seton, the 20th 
June 1493- The charter of foundation is afterwards confirmed 
by Andrew Abbot of New bottle, therein defigned Apoftolicae 
Sedis Delegatus. He built likewife the reveflry or Sacrifty of 
Seton, and covered it over with ftone, in the reign of King 
James IV. ; and, dying foon afterwards, was buried near the 
high altar of this collegiate church. The building is ft lit almoft 
entire. 

Clofe by the church flood the princely ruins of Seton-houfe, 
the refidence of the Earls of Wintoun. Upon the attainder of 
the late Earl in 1715, the eftate fell to the Crown, by whom, in 
17 19, it was fold to the York Buildings Company, who fuffer- 
ed the houfe to fall to decay. In 1790, the whole was taken 
down by the prefent proprietor, to make way for a houfe, now 
almoft fimfhed, on a defign of the late Mr Adam, in the ol ;

to fupply the whole town, which is conduced to the head of 
it in wooden pipes. The inhabitants, towards the bottom, 
are obliged to bring it to their houfes in barrels upon carts. 
A plan has been in agitation to raife a futn to carry the wa- 
ter through the town in a leaden pipe. But the permanent 
proprietors differ as to the mode of railing it, and there the 
matter at prefent refts. 

The near vicinity of the coal has likewife its difadvantages-. 
The poorer claffes of the community are attracted to the 
place with the flattering profpecT: of cheap fuel ; and many 
of the operative people about thefe works, being none of the 
beft oeconomifts, the poor's funds are, of courfe, fenlibly 
burdened. The grievance to the ^landed property is the 
greater, as thefe lucrative mines, from their precarious nature, 
plead an exemption from poor's rates. The great number of 
carts that daily refort to the different collieries, are extreme- 
ly deftrudYive of the roads ; fo that, in many places, fome of 
the crofs roads in this parifh are almoft impaffable. 60 1. 
the ftatute money of the parifh, fcarce ferves to fill up the 
track ; and great part of that fum is expended at improper 
feafons. A bill is propofed to be brought into Parliament 
next feffion, which, it is to be hoped, will remedy the above 
inconveniencies, fo fenfibly felt, at leaft in this parifh..— 
At a moderate computation, betwixt 3000 and 4000 gallons 
of whifky are annually retailed in the parifh, befides what 
are commiffioned by private families from the (tills. The 
extraordinary cor.fumpt of this article throughout , Scotland 
at large, may indicate a thriving trade, and a productive re- 
venue, but affords a fmall profpedt of a fudden increafe in 
moral and focial virtues. — There is an excellent white free- 
ftone quarry in the neighbourhood of Tranent, out of which 
feveral of the modern houfes in the county have lately been 
built. There was, within thefe few years, a chalybeate 

ipringy 



of Tranent. 

fpr'mg, in considerable repute, at Bankton ; but it has now 
difappeared, having found its way into the wafte below. 
A fmall library was eftabliflied laft year for the ufe of the 
parifh. The number of volumes, as yet, does not exceed 
200. The increafe, in a great meafure, depends on the coun- 
tenance and fupport of the more opulent ranks. The Sta- 
tiftical Account, fo far as publiftied, conftitutes pajt of the 
collection.

form what is properly ftiled the North Elk, a conliderable 
yiver, Separating the counties of Forfar and Kincardine, and 
containing many lucrative falmon filhings. This peninfula is 
about 2^ miles in length, by i \ in mean breadth, and is con- 
liderably diftinguifhed from the reft of the parifh in foil and 
fertility. The foil here is generally light black earth, or (harp 
gravel, with a tinge of clay ; and the bottom is gravel or yellow 
fand. Beyond this is another diftri£t, betwixt the hills and 
a projection from them, about 7\ miles in length, from E. to 
W. and I mile in breadth, the foil of which is more mixed 
with clay, upon a bottom generally of cold wet clay. This 
quarter will fometimes yield good crops of oats and bear, but 
is not fo grateful to the farmer as that of the former diftricl.

Proprietors, Rent, tsV The firft of thefe three diftrifts, 

about one half of the fecond, and the whole of the third, be- 
long to the Honourable W. Maule of Panmuir. The re- 
maining part belongs to Sir Alexander Ramfay Irvine, Bart. 
The firft diftrift, whofe furface is almoft a dead flat, never 
fails, with good management, to produce, in ordinary years, 
good crops of oats, bear, (rough bear cr Chefter), peafe, tur- 
nips, flax, and potatoes. The land, though lefs ftrong and 
rich than in many other places, is dry and early. It has hap- 
pened for a courfe of years, that when the crops have greatly 
failed in other places of the country, the farmers in this 
quarter have enjoyed crops much above the rate of their 
neighbourhood. Artificial grafs, efpecially white clover, pro- 
fpers well ; but that rich and permanent fward of grais 
which is found in more powerful foils, is wanting here. 
Rent, in this quarter, does not exceed 9 s. per acre, which is 
eafy to pay, from the induftry and improvements of the pre" 
fent leflees. About do acres of village lands, occupied by 
about a dozen of families, give 15 s. or thereby. The tenants 
in this quarter ftand chiefly by grain and black cattle. The 
two other diftri&amp;s have not the fame advantages, as labour 
upon them is liable to be kept back in feed-tune ; and the 
crop, from the wetnefs of the bottom, is fubjedl to be caft too 
late in harveft. One half of the middle diftricl:, whereof the 
foil is inferior, rents ftill lower than the former divifion. 
The other half yields about 10 s. In this quarter, the te- 
nants have the advantage of ftieep, in addition to their grain 
and black cattle. The rent of the third diftrift, which is 
far from means of improvement, and which is ftill more ex- 
poled to bad feafons, cannot be well afcertained. The pro- 
fits

fits of the farmer arife more from Iheep and cattle than from 
grain. 

Climate. — The air is generally fharp and piercing, as the 
furface of the parifli is for the moft part bare of fhelter, and 
js oppofite to two glens, which generate a current of air. 
No unwholefome vapour can arife, on account of the quick 
circulation of water, as there is every where a ready commu- 
nication with the rivers, whofe channels are deep and rapid. 

Natural 

Difeafes.~-Th.are are no very remarkible indances of longe- 
vity. One man, who h-.iA been born, and lived moft of his life 
in this p nfh died a few years ago, near to the age of 100. 
Another gave an account of him/elf, which mult have made 
him to be above that age : but it appears from the records, that 
his claim was not well founded One woman now lives in the 
"Village .l.iove the age of 90, and is ftill able to move Kbout : 
anorher is 86. Several have reached above 80. The m ft pre- 
vailing complaints are, afthma amongft the men, and hyiterical 
diforders amongft the women, rheumatifm in both fexes I'hefe 
may, in part, be caufed, or not a little heightened, by poor Jiet, 
hard labour, and forry lodging. Confumptions are alfo fatal 
to perfons in this parifh. No peculiar epidemical diforder pre- 
vails. Several years ago, many were cut off by an infectious 
putrid fever, which was, however, more fatal in fome neigh- 
bouring parifhes. The people are faft furmounting their prejudices 
againft inoculation. Some obferve, that the ague was frequent 
in their youth ; but the complaint is now hardly known. 

Antiquities. — The caftle of Edzell is one of the moft magnifi- 
cent ruins any where to be met with. It long belonged to the 
family of Lindfay, and now belongs to Mr Maule of Panmuir. 
It confifts of two (lately towers evidently in different ftiles, and 
built at different periods. Thefe are connected by an extenfive 
wall ; and large wings went backwards from the towers. Tra- 
dition fays, that the fquare tower, the moft ancient, was built 
and pofTefled by the family of Stirling, from whom it defcended 
to Lindfay of Glenefk. Of the former family, no traces now 
remain in thefe parts. The Lindfays of Glenefk, afterwards of 
Edzell, make a diflinguifhed figure in Scottdh hiftory Buchan- 
an mentions feveral remarkable actions in which thefe chieftains

Natural ProduEllons. — The water of the North Efe has 
obvioufly a petrifying quality •, becaufe the rocks through 
which it runs are of all degrees of confidence, from fanu in 
the very firft ftage of concretion, to ftom :s of i'ufficient h.u d- 
nefs for all the purpoies of ruble building. Tnere is alio a 
lime-»-aarry, to which all the tenants of the proprietor have 
right. It has been of fome iervice for a long cowrie of years j 
but the difficulty of procuring fuel to burn the lime-llones, 
is a bar in the way of its being very extenfively tifeful. i here 
are ftill many fpots of natural birch. But th-re is not a 
doubt this parifh once abounded with fine oak and beecv as 
(lately trees are often found in the nioffes. There is a tradi- 
tion,

fion of Edzell, their power furpalTed that of any other f iy 
in the county One of this family, about the btgimii it 
century, built a fmall caflle, called Auciwiull, in this parifh, .nd 
another, called Inmrmajk, in Lochiie, as lurking holes, while 
he was forced to fkulk leveral years for the murder of L' rd 
Spynic. One of them fucceeded his coufin, Earl Crawfnrd,. 
who had difinhtrited his own ion ; but the honours and e. ate 
afterwards reverted to the natural heir. The laft of this fa nily 
left the country about 1 7 1 4 having greatly degenerated from 
the martial character of his progenitors, and afterwards died in 
the north of Scotland, or in Orkney, in poverty and wretched- 
nets. This family, like other powerful chieftains, poireileri the 
power of life and death upon their ellate. The place of execu- 
tion Hill retains its name 

In two different parts, appear thofe monuments of antiquity 
commonly named Druialcal temples. Two of thefe are found at 
Culfridte, conlid-erabiy up the glen, within a few yards of one 
another. They conlift of tall upright tloncs, melding elliptical 
fpaces ; the largeft about 45 feet by 36, the fmalleft'Yomewhat

tion, that the elevated grounds, dividing the upper and lower 
quarter of the parifh, were formerly clothed with wood ; 
now they bear only heath. Previous to 17 14, there were 
lbme avenues to the caftle of moft ftately beech, of which 
hardly a vcftige now remains. The late Earl of Panmure, 
about 20 years ago, made two plantations, chiefly of Scotch 
fir ; one of them about 4 miles in circumference, the other 
of lefs extent. Both are thriving admirably, and promife 
advantage to the proprietor, and much benefit to the country. 

Birds and animals are much the fame as in other parts of 
the country. Birds of paffage are, the cuckoo, i wallows of 
different fpecies, fea-gulls occafionally, from a loch in the 
neighbourhood. Birds of fong are, linnets, thrulh, black- 
bird, red-breaft. Wild animals are, fox, hare, otter, polecat, 
weafel. No deer are inhabitants of the parith, although a 
fevere ftorm fometimes occafions a vifit from them. There 
is a confiderable falmon fiihing. The fifh are moftly difpo- 
fed of by contract with merchants in Montrofe concerned in 
the London trade. The (heep may amount to about 2000. 
The horfes and cattle are not diftinguifhed by any remark- 
able circumftance. Till lately, the horfes were in general 
rather of middling ftrength, but the breed is gradually im- 
proving. It is believed that the parilh fupplies itfelf with 
that article, but it does not much more. The farmers here 
have not hitherto attended much to fearch out the beft breed 
of either horfes or cattle. The better fort may average about 
1 81.; the inferior much lower. Beft oxen, from 3 to 4 
years old, about 6 1. Beft cows about 5 1. ; inferior, 3 1. 

State of Agriculture. — Under this head, the circumftances 
of the parifli, compared with what they were 30 years ago, 
offer a very pleafing fubjeel of contemplation. At that peri- 
od, the greater part of it had been recently held of tackfmen 

under 



ef Edzelh 



under the York Buildings Company* by a precarious and 
cruel tenure of one, two, or three years. The tenants had 
no encouragement to induftry, and they were not induftrious. 
Almoft their only mean of fubfiftenee arofe from their fheep. 
The land hardly repaid labour j 40 or 50 threaves (4 ftooks) 
have been often talked of as then inlufficient to yield a boll 
of grain. In tearing the miferable foil, they ufed often 6 
horfes, fuch as they were, never lefs than 4, often 4 horfes 
and 6 cattle. Lime, as a manure, was almoft; unknown* 
Noiv, they enjoy the fecurity of leafes, judicioufly grunted, 
to encourage the erecting of good fteadings, and improving 
the ground. Lime has been employed with great fuccefs. 
An inftance lately occurred, of about 16 bolls of oats, and 
another of 20 bolls of bear, after one. The ufual average 
may be about 6 returns of the feed. The ground is almoft 
never let out of cropping, without being laid down with 
grafs feeds. The ordinary fpace of fo lying is 4 years, of 
which the firft, and fometimes the fecond, is hay ; the re- 
mainder pafture, From two fifths to one half is generally in 
grafs. The land is cropped 4 years, of which one or two 
are green crops. Turnips fuit well, but are not yet cultiva- 
ted to the height which they will probably foon reach, as k 
is not as yet very common to raife them for the purpofe of 
feeding. Every one has them in greater or lefs quantity, as 
winter food for milch cows and young cattle. Flax fuits this 
foil. The average quantity raifed may be about 16 acres. 
Cabbage, as a field crop, has been tried in feveral cafes with 
good fuccefs. The quantity of potatoes raifed is very confi- 
derable, as almoft every family is connected with land, and 
fupply themfelves with that moft ufeful root. The grain is 
fuch as may be expected. It is neither fo weighty nor valu- 
able as that produced from carfe or richer inland foils ; but it 
is, in general, at leaft equal to that of the fnrroundine coun- 
Vol. X. O try , 



i°6 Statljlical Account 

try. No wheat, and but little barley, is raifed. The bear U 
not remarkably large in the grain, but is thin in the rind, 
weighs well, and recommends itfclf to the maltfter and meal- 
maker. Oats, in ordinary years, give 16 pecks of meal, of 
8 {lone, after 16 pecks of grain. Until within a few years 
ago the old Scotch plough was univerfally ufed, even on the 
moft clear and eafy foils ; and the harnefs was fuch as the 
ordinary farm fervants could make. Now, Small's plough, 
with the fhort iron head, and caft metal mould-boards, is 
getting into ufe. Harnefs, of the moft complete kind, is 
every day coming into fafhion. Two horfes, with one man 
to work them, are now pretty general, and will foon be 
wholly eftablifhed, as the price of labour is high ; and more 
attention will be paid, of courfe, to the rearing and keeping 
of horfes. It appears that agriculture, at fome diftant period, 
was purfued to confiderable extent becaufe the prefent race 
of tenants, notwithstanding their great progrefs in improving 
wafte lands, have not yet gone fo far as their forefathers 
reached. Many tracks of land are found, with the marks of 
cultivation, pretty far up the hills, and in many other fpots 
now covered with heath, which the farmers of the prefent 
day have not yet been able to overtake. 

Rent. There are two farms above 50 1. ; 10 from 20 1. to 

50 1. ; upwards of 30 below 20 1. ; fome fo low as 3 1. inde- 
pendent of the village lands, which are occupied by 13 per- 
fons at about 48 1. Total rental at this time 950 1. 

Population.— -There is ground to believe, that population, in 
the laft century, was at leaft equal to what it now is. From 
the entry of baptifms in the old records, it appears that the 
village (Slateford) was then more populous than now. There 
are intimations of other villages, of which there is now little 

more 



of Edzell. ioj 

more than a vefb'ge. Many farms are named which do not 
now exift j and the adjoining farms have not received a pro- 
portional increafe. The foundations of buildings are fre- 
quently found where there is not now a houfe. Indeed it 
would not be furprifing that population fhould flourifh in the 
immediate vicinity of a powerful family, fo able, in turbulent 
times, to protect its retainers, and difpofed to encourage fefc- 
tlers, by the appointment of village fairs, markets, and other- 
wife. The parifli would feem to have loft, in point of popu- 
lation, from the Revolution till within the fpace of 20 or 30 
years ago, when the numbers have probably increafed.

Manufacluresy Exports, cjV. — No manufactures are carried 
on. The only fhadow of them is, that the weavers general- 
ly make pieces of coarfe cloth for country ufe, which they 
fell at the different markets in the neighbourhood. The 
exports are, oats, bear, meal, black cattle, fheep, yarn, but- 
ter, cheefe, fowls, eggs, and coarfe cloth. The imports are, 
wood, iron, leather, houfe and farming utenfils, fait, tea, 
fugar, fpirits, fine cloth, many of the necefTaries, and almoft 
all the luxuries of life. Thefe, however, are not yet con- 
fumed in an extraordinary quantity ; and the exports do cer- 
tainly far overbalance the imports *.

Circumjiances and Char after. — The people are nearly of one 
cla/s and condition. Their way of living arifes, either whol- 
ly or in great part, from the culture of the ground. Their 
manners are fuitable to their c ndition. Moft of the farm- 
ers are now in eafy circumftances, the confequence of the 
hard labour, frugality, and attention of the prefent genera- 
tion. They have not laid afide thofe good habits. With 
few exceptions, they are diftinguiflied for integrity, fobriety, 
and diligence. Acting from a fenfe of their relation to their 
Maker, they are, of courfe, punctual and ferious in perform- 
ing the duties of religion. Their devotion, too, is of a ra- 
tional, tolerant nature, not breaking out into heats againft

in an equal and charitable fpirit. The dhTenters from the 
cflabliflied Church attend occafionally upon it, and live with 
the minifter and people as if there was no difference in their 
views. Splendid acts of beneficence do not fall within their 
lot. But the poor in the feveral quarters of the parifh, in 
fuch fevere feafons as this, in point of fuel, find thxrnielves 
cared for by their neighbours, when even the good aliment 
from the leffion funds could not command the carriage of 
that elfential article. In the year 1783, fo diftrefsful to 
Scotland, the farmers in the body of this parifh had a better 
crop, and more fafely got in, than in almoit any part of the 
country. Several of them manifefted their good difpofitions, 
by fending meal to be difpofed of by a proper perion in a 
centrical fpot, to fuch houieholders as were recommended by 
the kirk-feffion, confiderably below the market price. The 
people here are, in general, extremely contented with their 
condition •, and they have no fmall caufe to be fo, as even 
the pooreft of them, both men and women, who enjoy 
health, have abundance of work, and good encouragement. 
Even the cottars, fubtenants, tradefmen, and labourers, who 
have families, have their children fought after almoit as foon 
as they are able to do any thing ; and the education of the 
young folks is often helped forward by thofe with whom 
they refide, in order to attach them more ftrongly as Ser- 
vants- The people here have no propensity to emigration 
and adventure. Not above one or two are in the army, and 
none in the navy. A confiderable number of the prefent 
inhabitants were born in other parifhes, but all are natives of 
Scotland. To this contented, quiet fpirit, it is probably ow- 
ing that flagrant crimes do not occur. It is beyond a doubt, 
that the people are much improved fince laft century, both in 
morals and in manners. In the old records, there are in- 
stances of perfons Subjected to difcipline for dragging nets on 

the 



of Ecfceth 



ill 



the Sabbath •, and farmers, with their wives and fervants, 
convened in parties for drinking, fighting, and fcolding, on 
the Lord's day during divine worfhip. Such irregularities 
would now caufe horror. 

Difadvatitages. — One disadvantage under which this parifli 
formerly laboured, was the want of opportunities of giving 
their children education, from the inconvenient form and 
circumftances of the place. That is now remedied, to a cer- 
tain extent, by a fchool appointed under the Society for pro- 
pagating Chriftian Knowledge, (whofe inftitutions are produ- 
cing admirable effects), above two years ago in one quarter, 
and by a private fchool eftabiiftied fince, by the aid of one of 
the proprietors, in another. The encouragement of the pa- 
rifli fchoolmafter is pitiful, and, from the alteration of cir- 
cumftances, in no refpeel what it was originally intended to 
be. Another difadvantage, which probably never can be re- 
medied, (o far as to render this corner the feat of any exten- 
five manufacture, is fcarcity of fuel. The mofles are gene- 
rally fleep, and far diftant ; and the labour of preparing and 
carrying home peat, &amp;c. is exceflive ; and even thefe are 
nearly exhaufted. Montrofe, the fea-port town, is diftant 
about 12 miles, which greatly enhances the price of coals. 
The propofal, however, to remove the coafting duty, is a 
moft gracious and feafonable motion, and, we may hope, will 
contribute, with other circumftances likely to happen, to al- 
low that ufeful article at a reafonable rate. Other fuel is 
turf, cut from the muirs, and broom, which is of fervice, 
while the improvements in agriculture allow any to remain. 

Poor — The number of poor, upon an average of the laft 
6 years, is 1 2. The average of the fum diftributed to them 
for the fame period, 18I. The ieffion funds afifc, in part, 

from 



Statifiical Accouni 



from the intereft of a fum of money, in part from the volun- 
tary collections in the church, which average 14I. Thefe 
two maintain the poor in fuch a way as not only to be free 
of complaint, but to give full fatisfadtion to themfelves, and 
to thofe who live around them. If any happen to be whol- 
ly helplefs, board is allowed for them to their neareft rela- 
tions j or, if they have none fuch, perfons are paid for un- 
dertaking the care of them. There are two ftated meetings, 
at Whitlunday and Martinmas, for the purpofe of fixing the 
rates of the following half year, and for purchafing clothes. 
There is no great danger of impofition, as the poor muft have 
refided 3 years, at leaft, before any aid can be given. The 
elders in each quarter, by converfing with neighbours, and 
by their own obfervation, are able to form a pretty juft 
judgment of their neceffity. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — The church is a very old, ftrong build- 
ing, incommodious in itfelf, and inconveniently fituated for 
the whole parifh. The date of the building is not known ; 
but it muft have been erected long before the year 1641, as 
I find that the kirk-feffion in that year paid the " Sclaitter 
" for poynting the kirk, 5 1. 13 s. 4 d. Scots. It. Mair of 
« drink filler to his boy, 6 pennies." The manfe was built 
7 1 years ago, indifferently executed at firft, in a low fituation, 
has been often repaired at a confiderable expence, and now 
is in bad condition. The ftipend is about 61 1. with a glebe 
worth about 7 1. : but a procefs of augmentation is now 
depending. The Crown is patron.

THE utmoft length of the parifh of Aberfoylo, E. and 
W. is about 1 1 miles ; its utmoft breadth, N. and S. 
5 miles. This parifh derives its name from the Brinlh term 
Aber, which fignifies the confluence of two rivero or fir earns. 
This confluence takes place near the church, where a fr^all

mountainous diftricls to the N. and to the W. This parifh 
confilts of a narrow track of country, bounded on every fide 
by lofty hills and mountains. The •bottom of the valley is 
occupied by a feries of beautiful lakes, fkirted with woods 
of oak, afh, and birch ; and their banks arc occafionally di- 
verfified with fcanty portions of cultivated ground, the foil 
of which has, in the courfe of ages, been warned down from 
the mountains, and depofited by the dreams. 

The mountains are fometimes covered with oak woods 
niore than half way up. The lower eminences are, for the 
mofr. part, covered to their fummits. The higher regions 
are chiefly overgrown with heath ; and fometimes they pre- 
fent only the bare rugged rock. 

The molt considerable lakes are Loch Ketterin, Loch Con, 
and Loch Ard. The former is about eight miles in length, 
and one in breadth. Loch Con and Loch Ard are each be- 
tween two and three miles in length. Thefe lakes abound 
with eel, pike, and trout, all efteemed excellent in their 
kinds. The fifh caught here, however, bears no price, as 
there is no market to which it can be brought ; nor is there 
any reftriciion with regard to the fifheries of thefe lakes. 

The river Forth has its rife in the weftern extremity of 
this parifh. After paffing through the lakes, and receiving 
many acceffions from the ftreams that defcend from the 
mountains, it burfts forth, at the lower extremity of Loch 
Ard, with confiderable magnificence, over a rock near 30 
feet high. Hence it flows with a lefs agitated current through 
the eaftern diftrict of the parifh, which forms a beautiful and 
fertile valley, (denominated by the natives, according to a 
correfpondent Gaelic term, the Laggan), furrounded, like the 
reft of this diftricl:, on all fides by hills, with a narrow open- 
ing towards the S. E. by which the Forth, after having paf- 
fed fome woody heights, and a beautiful round hill, entirely 

covered

covered with oak, iffues into the plain. The higheft moun- 
tains bound the vale of Aberfoyle to the north, and difplay, 
in fome places, very abrupt rugged and tremendous preci- 
pices. Several ftreams, and the waters of a lofty cafcade de- 
fending from them, join the river as it flows amid the 
woods, meadows, corn-fields, and farm-houfes in the valley. 
In this part of the parifh the church arid manfe are fituated. 

None of fhe mountains of this parilh exceed the fecond 
rate in height. Benivenow and Benchochan are lofty hills, 
near 3000 feet high, but far overtopped by Benlomond, in 
the parifh of Buchanan* which, with its pyramidal mals, ter- 
minates the profpect to the weft. 

The great line Of the Grampian mountains, which extends" 
from N. E. to S. W. from the Girdlenels in Aberdeenfhire, 
to the hill of Ardmore, on the Frith of Clyde, takes its 
courfe, in a very marked direction, through the lower part 
of the parifh of Aberfoyle. The courfe of this range of hills, 
as far as has been obferved in this neighbourhood, is diftin- 
guifhed by a lingular arrangement of the minerals of whicli 
the rocks confift. On the eaftern fide of this line of moun- 
tain, the rock confifts of rounded or oval pebbles, from the 
fize of a pigeon's egg, to maffes of 9 or 10 inches in diame- 
ter, which contain in them much iron ore, and which feem, 
at fome period, to have been loofe and detached. They are 
now, however, ftrongly cemented into the body of the rock 
by a fubftance of a calcareous nature. Adjoining to this, on 
the weft, are found, from time to time, maffes of limeftone, 
difpofed in nejls^ as the workmen term it, and not in ftrata 
bf a regular dip j and no where, in this neighbourhood, is 
limeftone found, except in this line of the Grampian Moun- 
tains, and uniformly on the weft fide of the rock. The lime- 
ftone is blue, with beautiful veins of white. It admits of a 
fine polifh, and has been made into chimney-pieces, which.

approach the beauty of marble. It is ufed for manure ; bur, 
as the accefs is difficult, the ufe of it is principally contiiud 
to the tenants of the Duke of Montrofe, the proprietor. 
The weftern fide ot this range of mountains, after the inter- 
vention of immenfe mafies of granite, confifts of flate, of 
good quality, which is wrought whenever there is a demand 
for it. The want of water-carriage, however, and the dif- 
tance of a market, render the coniumpt very inconfidenble. 

Before we quit the account of the general afpee"t of this 
diftrict, it may be oblerved, that it is one of thofe which 
may furnifh the naturalift with a proper field for decifive 
concluiions with regard to the original ftructure, and the 
fubfequent changes of our terreftrial globe. A lengthened 
track of country, bounded on eviry fide by lofty mountains, 
traverfed through its whole length by a river, now become 
confiderable by the acceffion of numberlefs dreams, and 
which, alter loting itielf, from time to time, in extentive 
lakes, at length burfis out by a narrow paflage into a great 
plain, feems to promife a fair exhibition of the real effects 
that are to be attributed to running water, that univerfal 
agent, as fome modern phdolophers account it, in changing 
the lupcrficial afreet of our earth. 

In contemplating this, and fimfiar fcenes which occur eve- 
ry where in the Highlands, one cannot help obferving, that, 
had the great excavations between the mountains been occa- 
sioned by the gradual attrition ot the running waters, the ef- 
fects produced mult have been much more confiderable, than 
the formation of a few (canty fpots of fertile foil in the fub- 
jacent valleys. Here, too, the pointed argument of De Luc 
muft occur wiih great force, that the filling up of the inter- 
vening 1 .kes muft aave been one of the earlicft effects of the 
copious depofit fro'ni the mountains. In all thefe lakes the 
current is altogether imperceptible. In them, therefore, the 

kdiment 



of Aberfoyle, 



fedfment mud have firft fubfided ; yet it is not obferved that 
the laple of ages diminifhes either their depth or their extent. 

The truth teems to be, that the effects to be attributed to 
running water, in changing the afpect of a country, have al- 
ways been proportionably fmall, and that they neceffarily be- 
come every day more inconfiderable. In the firft ages of the 
world, indeed, whilft the earth was yet recent, the adhefion 
of its parts, not yet cemented by the continued operation of 
gravity, muft have been lefs than at prefent ; and even the 
tenacity which the earth might have acquired, muft have 
been greatly impaired by the event of the general deluge. 
In the more early periods, therefore, there is room to believe 
that the revolutions on the furface of our globe muft have 
been more numerous, and more confiderable than they now 
are. 

An appearance occurs in the eafiern extremity of the pa- 
rifh, at the farm of Nether Donnans, which feems to coin- 
cide with this obfervation. It confifts of a great number of 
regular ridges or mounds, formed of beds of gravel and fand, 
and covered with a green fward of fine grafs. They are from 
3 to 7, and even 10 feet high, broad at the bafe, and nar- 
rowing gradually to the top. They run fometimes in a pa- 
rallel direction, and fometimes diverge at various angles, for 
the length of 200 or 300 yards. The whole has, at firft: 
light, the appearance of a Roman encampment, and has by 
fome been determined to have been one. But it is un- 
doubtedly a Lufus Naturae, formed probably by the river 
Forth, before it had fcooped out its prefent channel to it- 
felf ; and which, though its courfe be now at fome diftancs 
from this fpot, and its bed confiderably lower, feems to have 
ranged over this and many of the adjacent fields, before it 
had obtained for itlelf a free paffage into the plain below. 

The

The channels of the river having now, however, been de- 
termined by the lapfe of time, and even, in fome inftances, 
fixed down by the hand of man, thefe changes have at length 
become lefs frequent, and lefs remarkable. The acceffions 
of foil from the mountains have been gradually diminifhed 
by the conlblidation of their ftrata. The ftreamlets that run 
down from the hills have hollowed out a regular channel for 

« 

themfelves. In tracing their progrefs, we find that their ef- 
fects are perceptible only as they approach the valleys ; 
whereas, towards their fources, near the fummit of the 
mountains, thefe are reduced almoft to nothing. 

Rare Plants. — There are few diftrifls, perhaps, of the 
fame extent, which prefent fuch a fertile field to the botanift 
as Aberfoyle. Befides the vegetables common to the lower 
grounds, many of the rarer Alpine plants are to be found 
upon the mountains. Nor are the natives ignorant of the 
medical ufes of many of their vegetables. A decoction of 
the lichen pulmonarius is applied externally, with fuccefs, to 
the cure of inflammations in the throat. The roots of the 
Angelica and meum are ufed as aromatics. The tujftlago is 
ufed in pulmonary complaints. The roots of the orobus tu- 
berofus, which abounds, are held in high efteem ; and it is 
imagined that their juice invigorates, and enables to refift 
hunger for a long time. To avoid prolixity, a lift of fome 
of the rarer plants is fubjoined in a note *.

ceffible rocks j but, as great pains have been taken to de^ 
ftroy the fpecies, it is now rare. The ofprey, or water eagle, 
builds in an ifland of Lochlomond, in this neighbourhood, 
and pays us frequent vifits. The falcon has her eyrie in 
many of our rocks. In winter, the lakes are covered with 
water-fowl ; among whom fwans, and fome of the rarer fpe- 
cies of colymbiy or divers^ are annually to be met with. The 
woodcock appears in the end of September, or beginning of 
October, according to the rigoroufnefs or mildnefs of the

fwallow appears on the 25th or 26th of April, and difappears

red game, the lower grounds with partridges and fhipes. 
Wild pigeons are alfo frequent. The wood-pecker is fome- 
times feen, but rarely. 

Soil and Climate. — The foil, having been formed, for the 
moft part, by the fediment depofited by the ftreams defend- 
ing from the mountains, is light and quick. It is generally 
remarked, that the harveft is earlier in Aberfoyle than any 
where in the vicinity towards the fouth, where the flat coun- 
try begins. 

The air is (harp and healthy. This neighbourhood is fel- 
dom vifited by any epidemical diforders. Fevers are the 
moft frequent difeafes j they are to be attributed to the na- 
tives being much expofed to getting wet, in a climate where, 
from the mountainous nature of the country, rains are fre- 
quent. 

Population. — About the year 1770, almoft all the upper 
part of this parifh was converted into Iheep farms, for which 
the nature of the foil is peculiarly adapted. Since that peri- 
od, the population of this parilh has been, no doubt, confi- 
derably dimindhed, but in what proportion, it is not now 
eafy to afcertain. 

With regard to the firft of the following tables, exhibiting 
the prefent population of the parifh, it is to be obferved, that 
it was made up with all poflible accuracy in 1790. Within 
thefe two years, however, feveral families of cottagers have 
emigrated to Balfron, a thriving village about 8 miles diftant, 
where a cotton manufactory is carried on upon an extenfive 
icale. 

With regard to the fecond table of marriages, births, and 
deaths, feveral difficulties have occurred, fome of which it is 
now impoflible altogether to obviate. 

As 



of Aberfoyle. 



As to the births, notwithftanding every attention of the 
feffion, parents too frequently neglett the registration of their 
children's names, efpecially when they die in early infancy. 
Betides, there are a few families of Nonjurants in the parifh, 
who never enter their births in the regifter. To render 
the average juft, therefore, the fum of 5 or 6 may be annual- 
ly added to the births. 

With regard to the marriages, it is believed that the table 
is fufficiently accurate. 

As to the deaths, a difficulty almoft infurmountable oc- 
curs. It has been an immemorial cuftom to ufe the mort- 
cloth or pall only for perfons above 1 o years of age ; and 
thofe burials alone are recorded, as they produce a tax to the 
poor. Paupers, too, being exempted from this tax, are not 
enrolled in the regifter of burials. 

An attempt has been made to fupply thefe deficiencies in 
the regifter by calculation. Of children born, it is generally 
allowed that more than one half die before the age of 10 
years. In order, however, to be within bounds, and making 
allowance for the healthinefs of the climate, the deaths under 
10 have been ftated only at one half of the children born. 

For the unregiftered deaths of paupers, the annual average 
ef 2 has been taken, as approaching nearly to the truth.

AH the inhabitants of Aberfoyle confift of farmers, or 
tackfmen, (whofe number is about 38), a few fubtenants, 
fhepherds, cottagers, and handicraftfmen, with their refpec- 
tive families. Of handicraftfmen, viz. fmiths, taylors, Ihoe- 
makers, weavers, mafons, and carpenters, the number is about 
16. 

The number of inhabited houfes is 157, which, at the 
common calculation of 5 perfons to every family, correfponds 
very nearly with the a£hial population of the parifh. 

From the above tables may be feen the annual proportion 
between the births, marriages, and deaths, and the whole 
population of the parilh. The produce of every marriage 
appears, at a medium, to be nearly 6. 

All the inhabitants are of the eftabliflied Church, excep- 
ting 5 or 6 families, who are Nonjurants, and adhere to the 
Epifcopalian form of worfliip. There are 2 poor perfons

The people are, in general, fober, indubious, and courte- 
ous to ftrangcrs. They are contented with their condition, 
and firmly attached to Government. It is but jufiice to add, 
that, in the late ferment which prevailed in fome parts of the 
country, they continued to exprefs an uniform abhorrence of 
all feditious and levelling principles. 

Productions. — The arable ground in Aberfoyle bears but an 
inconfiderable proportion to that which is employed in paf- 
ture. Of this proportion, however, no precife eftimate can 
now be offered. The fields are employed in railing oats, 
barley, peafe, potatoes, and flax. Peafe are not much culti- 
vated, on account of the wetnefs of the climate. Of potatoes 
and flax, only fo much is raifed as is fufficient for immediate 
ufe. The hills are altogether occupied in the pafture of 
fheep, goats having been profcribed, on account of the injury 
they do to the woods. Btack cattle, of a fmall breed, are 
reared with advantage on the lower grounds. 

It may be obferved in general, that the upper part of the 
parifh, which occupies by far the greateft fuperficial extent, 
confilts of fheep farms j and the lower part, of cultivated 
grounds. The pofieffbrs of the iheep farms feldom raife fo 
much grain as is fufficient for themlelves, and for their fhep- 
herds. The farmers in the lower diftrict generally raife a 
little more than is fufficient for their own confumpt. The 
leales on the fheep farms are given for 9 years j thofe on the 
grain farms for 18 years. 

The culi ivat ion of lown graffes can fcarcely be faid to 
have been yet introduced amongft us, a few of the more in- 
duftr ous tenants only laying down an acre or two, for the 
benefit of their milch cows. The culture of field turnip is 
almoft unknown, though pracliled fuccefsfully by Mr Graham 
of Gartmore, at the diitance of two miles only. 

Next

Next to the breeding of fheep, the mod advantageous 
mode of farming is the wintering of black cattle, for which 
many farms in this parifh are peculiarly adapted, by the fhel- 
tcr which the woods afford againft the inclemencies of the 
weather. When the fnows cover the ground, the cattle arc 
fed with hay of the natural grafs produced on the bogs, and 
cut down in Auguft. The cattle are bought in at from 2 1. 
i os. to 3 1. 15 s. in November, and fold in May, to be fat- 
tened for the butcher. The average profit has, for fome 
years paft, been from 18 s. to 20 s. 

Wool, too, is a confiderable article of commerce j it is fold 
from 5 s. to 9 s. or 10 s. per ftone. The farmer is alfo aflift- 
cd in making up his rent by the fale of butter and cheefe. 

In enumerating the productions of Aberfoyle, its extenfive 
and valuable woods, confiding principally of oak, muff not 
be omitted. The whole woods of this parifh (including about 
a 24th part on the Outfkirts of the neighbouring parifh) are 
divided into 24 lots or parcels, one of which is annually fold, 
and cut down ; fo that, in 24 years, the whole woods are cut 
down, and the fame rotation again ready to commence. By 
the prefent regulation, the purchafer is obliged to leave for 
ftandards, 400 trees of 24 years growth, 8 of 48 years, and 
8 of 72 years. From the diftance of market, the timber 
brings little price ; it is generally fuppofed that it pays the ex- 
pence of cutting, and ftripping off the bark. The bark itfelf 
fells, at prefent, at 1 s. 6 d. per ftone. It is driven to water- 
carriage at Stirling. 

Proprietor and Rent. — The property of this parifh was an- 
ciently vefted in the Grahams, Earl of Monteith ; but, on 
the failure of heirs male of that family about the end of the 
laft century, their eftate came to the family . of Montrofe. 
The Duke of Montrofe is now fole heritor in this parifh, 

being 



1 



Stati/lical Account 



being at the fame time patron, proprietor, and fuperior, ex- 
cepting that a fingle farm (Drumlane) holds blench of the 
Duke of Argyle. 

No eftimate can now be given of the land rent of the pa- 
rifh. Some of the fheep farms rent as high as 70 1. 80 1. and 
even 150I. The medium rent of the grain farms is about 
20 1 or 30 1. The valuation of the whole parifh is i960 1. 
6 s. 8 d. Scotch. 

About the beginning of this century, it became neceflary 
to ftation a company of foldiers at Inverfnaid, in the parilh of 
Buchanan, in order to fupprefs the depredations of freeboot- 
ers, who then infefted this neighbourhood. Proper barracks 
were built for them, and a very tolerable road carried through 
the whole length of this parifh, by which alone Inverfnaid is 
acceffible. Several bridges have been thrown over the tor- 
rents, by the judicious application of the vacant ftipend which 
has fallen from time to time ; and the roads are ftill impro- 
ving under the attention of the Duke of Montrofe's factor, 
who, with great propriety, has lately converted the ftatute 
labour into money. 

Poor and Schools. — The number of poor at prefent in the 
parifh roll is about 24. Of thefe, not above 4 or 5 s o about 
as common beggars. The reft are able, in fome meafure, to 
contribute to their own fubfiftence, and receive, from time to 
time, foine aid from the parifh funds, which, at an average, 
amount to 22L annually. They confifl of the following

Befides the parochial fchool, there are two fchools on the 
foundation of the Society for propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge; the one for teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic; 
and the other for learning girls to knit and few. In the paro- 
chial fchool, the rudiments of the Latin tongue are taught. 
The number of youth who attend each of the reading fchools 
is, at an average, between 30 and 40 *. 

Fuel. — The common fuel of this country is peat, which is 
fufficiently abundant, but precarioufly obtained in this rainy 
climate. Of wood alfo, there is a confiderable fupply ; but 
coals are not to be had nearer than Bannockburn, at the dis- 
tance of 22 miles.

prove an infuperable bar to the introduction of any confider- 
able manufactures in this neighbourhood : nor can this natu- 
ral difadvantage be removed, except by rendering the Upper 
Forth navigable for fmall veffels ; and this feems to be an 
object which might be accomplished at no great expence. 
The fall of the river, in its whole courfe from the eafteru 
•xtremity of this parifh, through the great mofs, to Stirling, 
is very inconfiderable ; and the ground, confiding almolt 
•wholly ef mofs and clay, is eafily wrought. It is well known, 
that, about 30 years ago, this very undertaking was agita- 
ted, and a particular eftimate of the work, and of its ex- 
pence, made out by MefTrs Golborne and Watt, under the 
direction of the late Lord Cathcart, then Prefident of the 
Board of Police. But that fcheme, which promifed fo fairly 
for the mutual advantage of the Highlands and low country, 
was, on fome account or other, unfortunately abandoned. 
It is to be hoped, that, in this age of public fpirit and im- 
provements, the great proprietors in the neighbourhood will 
be yet induced to procure the benefits of an inland naviga- 
tion to a country which the cheapnefs of living, the abun- 
dance of running water, and of wood fitted for every kind of 
machinery, feem to point out as a proper feat for cotton- 
works and bleachfields. Add to thefe natural advantages of 
this neighbourhood, its inexhauftible rocks of flate, which, if 
water-carriage could be obtained, would be alone fufRcient to 
fupply the confumpt of the populous countries adjacent to 
the banks of the Forth, from its fource to the fea. Here, 
it would feem, that, in fuch an event, a woollen manufacture 
might be advantageoufly eftablifhed. Situated in the very 
opening of the Highlands, the wool of the weftern diftricts 
of Perthfhire, and the adjacent parts of Argylefhire, would 
find a market of eafy accefs ; and the proprietors and oc- 
cupiers of fheep farms might be induced to pay that atten- 

tipn

tlon to the improvement of thrs ftaple of our country which 
it merits. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — In antient times, the Gaelic 
language alone was fpoken in this parifh ; and, even in the 
memory of man, it extended many miles farther down tli£ 
country than it now does. The limits of this antient tongue, 
however, are daily narrowed here as every where ehe, by the 
increafing intercourfe with the low country. At prefent, 
every body underfrands Englifh, though the Gaelic is chiefly 
in ufe. The fervice in church is performed in Englifh iij 
ihe forenoon, and in Gaelic in the afternoon. 

The ftipend is 62 1. 10 s. in money, together with a chal- 
der of barley, and a chalder of oat-meal. The glebe coniifts 
of above 1 5 Scotch acres of ground of good quality, partly 
arable, and partly meadow. The manfe is a commodious 
building, and in good repair. The church is a forry edifice j 
but is about to receive fome repairs, which, it is hoped, wilj 
render it a decent place of worlhip. 

The antiquities of this parifh. are neither numerous nor 
important. On a rifing ground, in the neighbourhood of 
the manfe, and facing the fouth, there is a circle of ftones, 
which there is room to believe to be a relic of Druidifin. 
It confifts of 10 large flones, placed circularly, with a larger 
one in the middle. They feem to have flood originally on 
one end, but have now fallen, and are partly funk into the 
earth. From this circumftance, it feems to be, that the 
Highlanders, when fpeaking of the kirk of Aberfoyle, uni- 
formly make ufe of the term Clachan, i.e. the circle of 
(tones ; and the fame term is ufed when fpeaking of many 
other places of worfhip, both in the Highlands and in the 
low country, places where it is probable that 1'uch circles did, 
or do frill, exift.

(Synod of Fife.— Prefbytery of Dunfermline.— County of 

Perth.) 

By the Reverend Mejfrs Robert Rolland and Walter 

M'Alpine.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

f I ^HE proper name Culrofs, which equally belongs to the 
JL town and parifh, is evidently of Gaelic origin, and is 
compounded of two words, viz. Cul and Rofs ; the firlr, 
Cut, lignifying back, or, more properly, what is exprefied by 
Clunis in Latin ; and Rofs, a peninfula ; the peninfula here 
referred to, being the whole diftrict between the Friths of 
Tay and Forth, and which formerly went under the general 
name of Rofs. The p.irilh lies along the N. fhore of the 
Frith of Forth. The barony of Kincardine, contiguous there- 
to on the W. formerly belonged to it, but was disjoined in. 
the year 1672, and united to Tulliallan. The extent of the 
parilh is 4 miles from E. to W. and about the lame from 
to S. making nearly a regular fquare, and containing 
8145 acres, Scotch meafure. Of thefe, nearly one third 
to the N. and W. confift chiefly of marfh and muir. 
hardly capable of any ether improvement than that of plant- 
ing, to which a conGderable part have already been ap- 
plied, and with much fuccefs, by the feveral proprietors •, in 

particular,

particular, a very extenfive plantation, begun in the year 
1752 by the late Earl of Dundonald, and confiderably en- 
larged by the prefent Earl, comprehending 800 Scotch acres, 
in a very thriving condition. The N. E. part of the parifh, 
though moftly arable, is, in general, poor and barren. To- 
wards the middle and S. the foil is either of a rich clay or 
dark loam, extremely fertile, and capable of the higheft cul- 
tivation. Till of late, very little wheat was raifed in the pa- 
rifh, and hardly any fown grafs, except by a few of the gen- 
tlemen ; but now the tenant, in common with the proprietor, 
begins to adopt the moft approved rotations and modes of 
culture ; fuch a^ wheat after fallow, with lime or dung ; af- 
ter this, drilled peafe or beans ; then barley, with grafs feeds* 
Again, if the foil is naturally rich, and in good heart, wheats 
after one crop of grafs j but, if otherwife, it is allowed to re- 
main in pafture from 3 to 4 or 5 years, when it is broken up 
for oats, to which a fallow or green crop fucceeds. As a 
proof how much the culture of wheat gains ground, one far- 
mer, in 1790, had upwards of 30 acres in wheat; but the 
prefent ftate of the cultivation of the parifh will beft appear 
by the ftatiftical table. 

Manures, Ploughs, and Rent. — The manures ufed are Umd, 
dung, and the refufe of tan pits. The former is brought 
from Lord Elgin's limeworks, diftant, at a medium, 6 miler. 
The plough which is now moft generally in ufe is the light 
Englifh plough, upon the improved plan of Mr Clarke of 
Newcaftle, executed by Mr Small of Blackadder-Mount, with 
fide and mould board of caft iron, drawn by two horfe9, and 
managed by one man, without a driver. Beft croft land 
near the town pays 48 s. per acre, in fmall parcels of 2, 3, 
or 4 acres. Beft land in the parilh, When let out in large 
farms, pays 30 s. per acre, and thence declining to 20 s.

Statiftical Account 



Valleyfield, the fartheft eaft, belonging to Sir Charles Pref- 
lon, is a modern, elegant, and commodious houfe. Next to 
that, on the weft, is the Abbey of Culrofs, (fo called from 
being fituated in the neighbourhood of the old abbey or 
monaftery), built by Edward Lord Bruce of Kinlofs. It has 
a magnificent front to the fouth, and a turret on each end, 
which, with the hanging gardens declining towards the 
Forth, give it a very noble appearance. The houfe, and 
grounds adjacent, came by marriage into the poffefiion of the 
family of Dundonald, whofe feat it now is. Adjacent to the 
Abbey is the church ; and, immediately below this laft, 
ftands the town of Culrofs, one ftreet of which is built upon 
the declivity of a fteep hill, running directly north from the 
fea ; the reft runs along the fhore, at right angles therewith. 
Almoft every houfe has a garden with fruit-trees belonging 
to it. The town altogether, efpecially in the approach from 
the harbour, has a very pidturefque and magnificent appear- 
ance. The town was erected into a royal borough in the 
year 1588, having its charter from James VI. in the 22d of 
his reign, and in conjunction with Stirling, Dunfermline, 
Innerkeithing, and South Queensferry, fends a reprefenta- 
tive to Parliament. The fhore oppofite to the town being 
flat, with funk rocks interfperfed, to a confiderable depth, 
renders the accefs for fhips of burthen incommodious ; not- 
withftanding of which, however, when the great coalwork 
flourifhed here under Sir George Bruce, a very confiderable 
trade was carried on, and different articles of foreign luxury 
diftributed from this to the neighbouring towns, even as far 
as Perth. At prefent, there is no foreign trade direclly from 
the place j but there is a regular ferry every day to Borrow- 
flounnefs, from which all the different articles of merchan- 
dize, are conveyed here at an eafy expence. The fpring- 
tides rife here from 15 to 16 feet. Further weft, and upon 

the 



of Culrofs,

the banks of the Forth, is CauTehill, antiently called Dunne- 
marie Caflle, that is, in the Gaelic language, the Cape by or 
near the fea, from a fort or ltrong hold of the Macduffs, 
Thanes of Fife, faid to be their utmolt boundary to the weft- 
ward. According to tradition^ it was here that the cruel 
murder of Lady Macduff and her children, by order of Mac- 
beth, forming an affecting incident in Shake! peare's tragedy 
of that name, was perpetrated. The cattle is in rums ; but 
a finer fituation for a houie can hardly be imagined, ^.ext 
to that, in the fame direction wefrward, is Biaircalfle, the 
feat of Robert Dundas, Efquire, a ftrong old houfe, laid to 
have been built by Hamilton Archbilhop of St Andrews, 
about the time of the Reformation. 

Surface. — There are no mountains ; but, in general, the 
land ltands high, riling fuddenly from tne Ihore (which is a 
dead flat ) to a confiderable height, thence declining north- 
wards by a gradual dcfcent, till near the middle of the parilh, 
from which again it riles to about the fame height, and near- 
ly by the fame an^le as upon the iouth fide, thus running 
from E. to W. in two inclined planes, lbmewhat in the fonu 
of a book when opened. Through the intermediate channel 
or bottom, runs a fmall ftream, called the Bluther, which, 
uniting with another, called the Grange, falls into the fea 
at Newmill-bridge, forming the eaftmoft boundary of the 
parilh and county. Thefe ferve to drive two corn-mills, 
from which the parilh is iupplied with meal. One of thefe 
being feldom deficient in water, and completely fitted up for 
making flour, pot barley, &amp;c. cargoes of wheat are frequent- 
ly brought to it from Dunfermline, Burrowltounnefs, and 
other places, to be ground, which renders it not only a valu- 
able pofieffion to the proprietor, but a public benefit to the 
neighbourhood. Thefe ftreams might perhaps be rendered

ftill more valuable, by their application to other manufac- 
tures. 

Population, fc-rY. — From the number of aged in the table, 
in proportion to that of the whole inhabitants, and by com- 
paring the births with the deaths, it will appear, that the 
peopie are, in general, healthy ; nor is there any difeafe that 
can be called epidemical in the place, though it has been re- 
marked, that, within a given period, more have been carried 
off by confumprions than by any other difeale. For the de- 
creafe of population from 1755 to 1791, the following caufes 
may be afligned : 

\Jl t In the country part of the parifh, many of the gentle- 
men having taken a larger proportion of land into their own 
management, either with a view to improvement, or for their 
own accommodation, but chiefly the former. 2dly, The ufe of 
the two horfe ploughs having prevailed of late almoft univer- 
fally, by which a driver to each plough, is faved. ^dly, The 
improvements which have taken place in hufbandry, efpeci- 
ally a more proper rotation of crops, and confequently a 
more judicious dillribution of labour between the different 
feafons, by which one plough, and one man, can be made to 
execute as much work, and to much better purpofe, than 
formerly could have been done by two ploughs, ,and four 
men. 4//'/;', (Partly in confluence of the above) Gentle- 
men being accuftomed to let out their lands in larger farms 
than formerly, by which means they have not only better 
fecurity for their rents, but the lands likewife kept in better 
heart and order, being let to more iubltantial tenants. Thefe 
caufes account for the diminution of population in the coun- 
try part of the parifh. The following are aligned for the 
decreale in the town : \Jl y The lots or decay of feveral 
branches of manufacture formerly earned on there, particu-

larly girdlemaking * and fhoemaking ; the former is now 
fupplanted by the Carron-work ; the latter was hrft checked 
by the laft American war, which put a flop for a while to 
the export trade, and, by this difcouragement, has gradually 
fallen into decay, idly, A prejudice, ariiiug from the above, 
that, where one or two branches of bufinefs have failed, *no 
other can fucceed ; hence young men of activity j after finifh- 
ing their education, never think of iettling at home, but look 
abroad to fome other place for employment. And, 3^/)', 
The flourilhing ftate of manufactures, efpecially of lace, in 
Dunfermline and Glaigow, and the numerous buildings and 
public works carrying on in Edinburgh, by which all the 
iurplus hands have been drained off. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — There are two minifters in the parifh, 
the charge being collegiate. The Earl of Dundonald patron. 
The ftipend of the firft minifter confifts of 60 bolls, Lin- 
lithgow meafure, of victual, and 48 1. 17 s. money. But 
the victual being paid in fmall proportions, and in different 
kinds of grain, viz. barley, peafe, and oats ; and the money, 
confiding partly of feu-duties that formerly belonged to the 
Abbacy of Culrofs, and collected in fmall fums from a varie- 
ty of hands, render the ftipend of lefs value ; fo that it may 
amount, commumbus tmnis, to fomething lefs than icol. with 
a manfe, glebe of 4 acres, and a fmall garden.. This minifter 
has befides, by the donation of private perfons, three fourths 
of an acre of garden ground ; but no ground for crafs, nor 
any allowance for it. The fecond miniiler's ftipend, by an 
augmentation obtained in May 1791, confifts cf 8 chalders 
victual, and 400 merks, Scotch money, and amounts, at a 
medium, to if 2 1. or from that to 1 i 8 1. per annum. He 
has neither manfe, glebe, nor garden, from the parifh ;~ but

which yield, one year with another, allowing tor the repairs 
of the old houle, 4I. There is an allowance for communion 
elements of 100 nierks Scotch, or 5 1. 11s. i^-d. Sterling. 

Poor, and Poor's Funds. — The poor within the parifh a- 
jnount in all to 67, of whom 14 are upon the weekly roll, 
having a regular allowance, and therefore may be confidered 
as wholly dependent upon the public funds ; but there are 
53 who receive aid only occafionally, and are partly lupport- 
ed by their own labour, and other accidental fupplies. There 
are no begging poor. The funds are, the intereft of 500 1. 
lent out at 5 per cent, which ftock has arifen from voluntary 
donations made to the poor by different perfons at different 
times, and the iavings of public collections formerly made \ — 
the weekly collections at the church doors ; — in times of 
fcarciry or dearth, the heritors have voluntarily affeffed them- 
felvfs to lupply the extraordinary demands of the poor ;— 
and a propofal was lately made and agreed to, that fuch heri- 
tors as did not refide, or were of a different communion from 
the eftablifhed Church, or did not attend the church regu- 
larly, fbould fend a certain proportion weekly for the fuppurt 
of the poor ; a mean of fupporting the poor equally proper 
and juft, eipecially in country parifhes. Befides what are 
properly called the parifh tunds, there are the following 
hofpitals and charitable foundations belonging to the place, 
or in which it has an intereft. In 1637, Thomas Earl of 
Elgin, fon of Lord Bruce of Kinlofs, founded and endowed 
an hofpital in the E. part of the town, for the maintainance 
of 12 aged perfons of the borough and parifh of Culrofs, to 
be prefenred by him and his male fucceffbrs, and commiffion- 
ers appointed for that effect, reserving power to him and his 

heirs

heirs to nominate others, though not of the parifh of Culrofs, 
In 1639, George Bruce of Carnock founded and endowed an 
hofpital in the W. part of the town, for the maintainance of 6 
decayed poor and aged women, widows of colliers or lalters, or 
of that kind, fome time workers in Culrofs or Kincardine ; 
and, if thefe be deficient, to other decayed poor and aged 
widow women in the parifh of Culrofs. They had a houfe 
and garden for their accommodation, and 24 bolls of meal

ManufaElures. — There is no manufacture of any note at 
prefent eftablifhed in the parifh, many of the weavers who 
refide in it being employed in working diapers for dealers in 
Dunfermline, or cotton cloths for thofe in Glafgow ; but there 
was formerly a fpecies of manufacture in fome meafure peculiar, 
if not altogether confined, to the place, from 30 to 40 hands 
having been ufually engaged in it. This branch was that of 
making of girdles, a kitchen utenfil well known in Scotland 
for toafting unleavened bread. By two royal grants, one of 
James VI. and the other of Charles II. ratified in Parliament 
in the year 1669, the girdlelmiths of Culrofs had the fole 
and exclufive privilege of making girdles, which were in- 
vented by them; but, in the year 1727, the Court of Sefiion 
found that no monopolies of this kind could be granted, in 
prejudice of any royal borough. The decline of that manu- 
facture

failure in Culrofs, which has now dwindled almoft to no- 
thing, is, however, not fo much to be afcribed to the Jofs of 
the patent, as to the cheaper mode of making girdles by the 
Carron Company from the power of machinery, the more 
frequent and general ufe of ovens, together with the prefe- 
rence now pretty generally given to wheat bread in every 
part of the country. Under this article of manufactures, it 
may be proper to mention the new and ingenious method of 
extracting tar from coal, now commonly known by the name 
of Briti/Jj tar, and which was firft practifed at Culrofs by the 
prefent Earl of Dundonald ; but of this and the other difco- 
veries made by his Lordfhip in practical chemiftry, and in 
different branches of natural philolophy, it is to be hoped 
a particular and fatisfadtory account will be given to the 
world by his Lordlhip's own hand. 

Fi/henes.^-Therc are but few fifh caught upon what are 
ftrictly called the fhores of Culrofs ; but on thofe of Kincar- 
dine, which formerly belonged to Culrofs, large quantities, 
to a confiderable value, are fometimes caught, especially her- 
rings, and a fmall but delicate fifh, called garvies. Phey are 
taken by a kind of fifh trap, called a cruive, made of wicker 
work, and compofed of three different parts •, firft, a large 
bafket, of an oval form, (more ftridtly called the cruive), from 
9 to 10 feet in length, and open at both ends, but confider- 
ably wider at one end than the other ; the wider end mea- 
furing at the mouth 7 feet in diameter, and the bafket taper- 
ing gradually down to the finaller end, whofe aperture is not 
more than 4 feet. To this fucceeds what, in the dialect of 
the fifhers, is called the bung, a leffer bafket, nearly of the 
fame form with the cruive, likewife open at both ends ; and 
the laft is the weal, about 44 feet long. The fmaller end of 
the cruive is inferted into the mouth of the bung, and the Imall 

aperture

aperture of the bung into that of the weal ; the end of the 
weal which is left out being entirely clofed. Thus joined, 
together, they are placed upon their fides, at a convenient 
diftance from the lhore, where, during the fpring tide, they 
are wholly overflowed at high water, and left dry at ebb, 
the mouth of the cruive pointing direttly up the river ; by 
which means the fifh that came up with the flood, returning 
again with the ebb, run into the cruive, from thence through 
the bung into the weal, where, not being able to recover their 
way into the water, they are caught by the fifhers when the 
tide is fully out. One of thefe cruives will fometimes yield, 
of herrings and garvies in a feafon, to the value of 61 81. 
and, in an extraordinary good year, even 10 1. There are at - 
Kincardine, 4 miles weft from Culrofs, 61 cruives ; at Langan- 
nat, a mile and a half nearer Culrofs, 83 ; and at another new 
flation midway between thefe, nicknamed by the fifhers Botany 
Bay, 35. In lucky feafons, fuch as was the year 1783, it was 
computed, that betwixt Kincardine and Langannet, there 
were caught of fifh to the value of 1000 1. and upwards- 
The cruive-fifhing feafon is from the month of Auguft till 
the beginning of March. In the darknefs and gloom of win- 
ter, and even amidft all the horrors of the tempeft, the fifhing 
of the cruives exhibits a very gay and enlivening fcene ; men 
and women of all ages, and in different companies, reforting 
to them, and carrying lamps of flaming charcoal, which arc 
feen at a diftance through the dark, moving in all directions, 
accompanied with the mixed cries of emulation, merriment,' 
and hope. The cruives belonged originally to the Abbot of 
Culrofs; but, after the Reformation, were parcelled out 
among the feveral proprietors who fucceeded to the church 
lands.

tities of ironftone and fome ochre j and, by the ingenuity of 
the Earl of Dundonald, there have lately been dilcovered in 
the crofts of Culrols, adjoining to the town, extenlive and deep 
beds of a very valuable clay, equal, if not fuperior in quality, 
for pottery and glafshoufe purpofes, to that which is brought 
from Stourbridge, in Worcefterlhire. 

Formerly, the coalworks of Culrofs were the moft confi- 
derable in Scotland ; it being ordained by act of Parliament 
in 1663, that the Culrofs chalder fhould be the ftandard 
meafure for Scotland ; and the number of falt-pans then in 
ufe amounted, as is aflerted, to no lefs than 50. Thefe 
works appear to have been in their moft flourifhing ftate in 
the reign of James VI. a little before, and fome time after, 
his accefEon to the crown of England. They were then 
wrought a confiderable way under the fea, or at leaft where 
the fea overflowed at full tide, and the coals were carried out 
to be fhipped by a moat within the lea-mark, which had a fub- 
terraneous communication with the coal-pit *. One caufe to 

which 

* There is a tradition, that James VI. revifiting his native 
country, made an excurlion into Fife ; and, refolving to take 
the diverfion of hunting in the neighbourhood of Dunfermline, 
invited the company then attending him to dine along with 
him at a collier's houfe, meaning the Abbey of Culrofs, then 
belonging to Sir George Bruce Being conducted, by his own 
defire, to fee the works belnw ground, he was led infenfibly by 
his hoft and guide to the moat above mentioned, it being then 
high water ; upon which, having afcended from the coal-pit, 
and feeing himfelf, without any previous intimation, furround- 
ed by the fea, he was feized with an immediate apprehenfion of 
fome plot againft his liberty or life, and called out, Treafon. 
But his faithful guide quickly difpelled his fears, by alluring 
him that he was in perfeel: fafety ; and, pointing to an elegant 
pinnace that was made fall to the moat, detired to know whe- 
ther it was moft agreeable to his Majefty to be carried afiiore 
in it, or to return by the fame way he came ; upon which the

which the decline of thefe works *, once fo flourifhing, is 
afcribed, is a violent ftorm which happened the very night 
on which King James died, by which the moat, and different 
parts of the machinery, were either greatly damaged, or to- 
tally deftroyed. From this fhock, though they were after- 
wards wrought partially, they never entirely recovered, and 
were, for a time, wholly deferted. At preient there is a 
temporary fupply of coal procured from the croppings of the 
old works, and gleanings accidentally left. It is certain, 
however, that very rich feams of coal yet remain, efpe- 
ciaily on the lands of Valleyfield, belonging to Sir Charles 
Prefton, under leafe to the Earl of Dundonald, which, on 
account of the great depth at which they lie, cannot be 
wrought to any purpofe without the expenditure of a confl- 
derable fum of money ; yet, fituated as they are, clofe to the 
lhore, and lb commodioufly for exportation, this obftacle, 
we are in hopes, will be foon removed. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatlons . — The public roads through the 
parifh of Culrofs are, in general, very bad, the poll road 
efpecially, which, being conducted too clofe to the fliore, is 
thereby overflowed, at fpring tides, to a great depth, render- 
ing it at fuch times not only impaffable, but to ftrangers ex-

i/7, Ecclefujlical. — At the eaft end of the town, on the fea 
coaft, the high road only- intervening, are the remains of a 
chapel, called St Mungd's Chapel, of which the tradition is, that 
it was on or near the place where St Mungo or Kentigern was 
born. He is faid to have been the fon of Eugemus 111. King 
of the Scots, and of a daughter of Lothus King of the Pifls. 
His mother Thametis finding herfelf with child, out of lhame, 
and apprehenfion of her father's wrath, Hole privately away; 
and, entering into a vefTel that (he found at the neareft coalt, 
was, by the winds and waves, call on land where the town of 
Culrols is now lituated, and there was delivered ;- and, leaving; 
the child with a nurfe, returned home. His parents being un- 
known, he was brought to Servanus, and baptized and brought up 
by him. This Servanus, or St Serf; lived at that time in an her- 
mitage, where the monaitery was afterwards built, and was, as 
is faid, fon of a King of Canaan. After various peregrinations, 
he departed this life at Culrofs, of which town he became the 
tutelar faint ; and, in honour of him, a whole day annually was 
formerly folemnized by the people here. This was attended 
with a variety of ceremonies, particularly parading the ftreets 
and environs of the town very early in the morning, with larg.2 
branches of birch and other trees in their foliage, accompanied 
with drums and different mulical inllruments, adorning the 
crofs, and another public place called the Tron, with a great 
profusion and variety of flowers, formed into different devices, 
and fpending the evening irrfeftivity and mirth. The day ap- 
propriated to this was the ill day of July; but, when the town 
was creeled into a royal borough, another feilive day was dedi- 
cated to what they call riding the marches ; which is, the magif- 
trates, councilors, and different incorporations, proceeding on 
horfeback, in a great cavalcade, and carrying feveral pairs of 
colours, round the boundaries of the town's domains, (which 
were formerly contiderable), and. at a certain period of their 
progrefs, calling over the names of the magiftrates and office- 
bearers, and burgefles, and fo proceeding back again into the 
town, and concluding the day with feafling, mulic, and dan- 
cing. The King's birth-day made a third public day; and, as

each of thefe ufually drew along with it three or four more, 
fometimes a whole week, of diflipation and idlenefs, it was wife- 
ly contrived to fink them all into one, which is now the King's 
birth-day, Hill a great day at Culrofs. In this are united the 
ceremonies of all the three. To this all the young people, of 
both fexes, afiiduoufiy refort, even from the mod diftant quar- 
ters of the country ; and, whilft the Saint himfelf is forgotten, 
and his name not fo much as known to many of them, his cere- 
monies are ftill preferved, and his fpirit continues to infpire 
them with focial mirth and joy. 

The monaftery, which was founded in the year 1217 hy Mal- 
colm Thane of Fife, lies N. W. from St Mungo's, at the head 
of the town, on a rifing ground, commanding a beautiful and 
extenfive profpecl cf the Frith. Confiderable -remains of it are 
yet to be feen. On the north fide was the Abbey Church, which 
had a tower or fteeple in the middle, ftill entire, as is alfo a 
part ol the church, now made .ufe of for the parilh church. 
The Abbey Church was dedicated not only to the Virgin Mary, 
but alfo to St Serf. At the Reformation, the rental of this 
Abbey amounted to 768 1. 16 s. 7 d. Scotch, in money ; 3 chal- 
ders, 3 bolls wheat ; 14 chalders, 10 bolls, 2 firlots barley; 1.3 
chalders, 12 bolls, 3 firlots, 34 pecks oats; 1 chalder, 2 bolls 
fait; 10 wedders, 22 lambs, 7 dozen of capons, 28^ do/.cn. 
poultry, 71 ftone of butter ; 79^ ftones of cheefe, and 8 trufles 
of ltraw. At that time, there were nine monks, of the Ciller- 
tian order, in the convent. About a quarter of a mile to the 
weft of the Abbey Church are the ruins of the old church, 
which was, before the Reformation, the parilh church, and 
which, with the church-yard around It, is ftill ufed as burial- 
ground. 

2d, Military Antiquities — There are ftill to be feen the re- 
mains of two old camps, from their oval form evidently Danifli, 
one in the N. W. quarter, near a place called Burrowan, which 
is faid to be the ftation to which the Danes retreated after their 
defeat at the battle of Innerkeithing ; the other a good way far- 
ther fouth, in the muir of Culrofs, was the ftation occupied by 
the Danes before the battle of Culrofs. The Praetorium is 
pretty entire, at leaft the trenches around it are very difcernible. 
About an Englifti mile farther eaft, are ihown the traces of 
the camp of the Scotch King Duncan ; and betwixt thefe, in 
the fame line, and nearly at an equal diftance from both, is the

preffive countenances. They are not only decently cloathed, 
but many of them, fuch as the young trades people, genteel- 
ly drefled, even more fo than is ufual with perfons of the 
fame flation elfewhere. Few are known to complain of 
wanting the neceffaries of life ; none, indeed, who are able 
and willing to work, or who are not notorious fyendthrifts. 
A general tjpirit of difcontent has never been known to prevail 
among them, nor are any combinations formed, on account 
of oppreflion, bad ufage, or want of fubfiftence, for leaving 
the country. In the country part of the parilh, their man- 
ners are, in general, fimple and virtuous, living in the habits 
of fobriety and induftry ; and, though not many of them are 
rich, yet they are contented with their fituation, enjoying 
the neceflaries, and many of the comforts, of life. We are 
forry we cannot give the fame favourable report, at leail 
without many exceptions, of thole in the town. This is 
chiefly owing to the unhappy influence of borough politics, 
which, in a place like this, where the numbers are fmall, 
draw almoft every individual trr.defman to act a part in them, 
when a competition happens, which is often the cafe ; thus 
communicating the baneful habits of idlenefs, and a talte for 
luxury and diffipation. We have, however, the comfort to 
add, that there are but few inftances of any atrocious crimes. 
For 20 years and upwards, there have been no murders com- 
mitted, one or two child-murders excepted. None have fuf- 
fered by the hand of the executioner, and only two by their 
own.

Norway's fon, who, according to tradition, was flair, there, fliil

A proper regard to religion, and refpea for its innitutions, 
almoft univerfally prevail. There is no place of worfhip but 
that of the eftablifhed Church. The number of feftaries, 
chiefly Burgher and Antiburgher Seceders, does not exceed 
50, and thefe fhow no fymptoms of fournefs or bigotry, but, 
on the contrary, are exceedingly mild, civil, and obliging in 
their manner, living in perfect good neighbourhood with all 
around them, and are by no means the leaft induftrious in 
the parifh. The fafhionable modes of free thinking are 
hardly known, and avowed by none, except by fuch, and 
thefe extremely few, as, from confcious vice and folly, ac- 
count it their intereft not to think, at all. 

P. S. By the late rapid extenfion and fuccefs of manufac- 
tures in the country, the fpirit of induflry, which feemed for 
a while to lie dormant, now begins to awaken; fo that, from 
June 1791, when a particular inveftigation was gone into, 
with a view to this report, a confiderable addition has been 
made to the number of looms in the parifh ; and tivo new 
branches of manufacture have been eftablifhed in the town, 
viz. thofe of tambouring and flowering muflins. In the firft, 
38 young girls are already engaged, from 9 years old and up- 
wards ; and in the other 34. Thofe below 12 years old are 
bound for 3 years, and have, for the fir ft year, is. 6 d. per 
week allowed them ; for the fecond year, 2 s. j and for the 
laft, 3 s. Thofe above 12, and below 16, have 2 s. per week 
the firft year, 2 s. 6d. the fecond, and 3 s. the lall ; and 
fuch as are older, and bound for only two years, have 2 s. 
the tint year, and 2 s. 6 d. the laft. So that now, in propor- 
tion to the numbers in a family, provided they are foberly 
and mduftrioufly brought up, their affluence and comfort in- 
creafe ; and, indeed, a fpirit of contentment and chearfulnefs 
is univerfally diffufed among the people, and hardly a mur- 
mur tc be heard.

(Prefbytery of Penpont. — Synod and County of Dum- 
fries.)</head> 



<p>HE parifh of Morton, lying on the E. fide of the river 



A Nith, 15 miles' N. W. from the town of Dumfries, is 
about 6 miles in length, from S. W. to N. E. and 31 in 
breadth, from S. E. to N. W. On the S. and S. E. it is 
bounded by the Cample ; on the north, by the Carron •, and 
on the W. by the Nith. One farm, indeed, has been fepa- 
rated from the reft of the parifh, by the Nith's changing its 
courfe, and now lies on the weft fide of that river. The 
parifh confifts of about 6340 Scotch acres, of which about 
j 800 are arable, 80 meadow, 4190 pafture, i8omofs, and 
00 woods and plantations. Along the banks of the Nith 
and Cample, there are about 200 acres of j»ood holm land. 
Adjoining to this is a confiderable extent of gently rifing 
ground, of a light but fertile foil, upon a gravelly bottom. 
The village of Thornhill is pleafantly fituated upon the higheft 
part of this ground. A little farther E. is a confiderable ridge 
of land fomewhat higher, the greater part of which is ft ill 
in a ftate of nature, though very capable of cultivation, as 
fo much of it as is improved turns to very good account.

oport a colder bottom. Farther E. ftill, the ground rifes into 
hills of a confiderable, though not remarkable, height, cover- 
ed partly with grafs, partly with heath and rocks. At the foot 
of thefe hills, on the W. fide, where the farm-houfes are 
placed, the croft land is pretty extenfive, and of an excellent 
quality. 

Proprietors and Rent— The Duke of Queenfberry is pro- 
prietor of the whole of this parifh, two fmall farms ex- 
cepted *. The prefent rent of this parifh is about 751 I, 
This, however, does by no means give a juft idea of the real 
Value of the fand, as the rents of the farms have not been 

raifed 

* In former times, a great chieftain had made his refidence 
here ; and to him, no doubt, a large dillritf of country around 
this had belonged. Of his caflle, called Morton Caplc, there is 
ftill a large ruin remaining. It (lands upon pretty high ground 
near the foot of the hills, on the E. fide of the parifh. The 
prefent remains meafure about ico feet in length, by 27 in 
width. But, from the traces of the foundation, it has evident- 
ly been, when entire, about double its prefent widenefs, and 
confiderably longer. A great deal of the Hones have been 
carried away at different times, to build houfes and dykes in 
the neighbourhood. The wall of the S. front is ftill quite entire 3 
it is between 30 and 40 feet in height, and has a large rounded 
tower at each end, of about 12 feet diameter In this front, at 
the height of about 12 feet, is a row of fmall windows, about 
16 inches fquare, to each of which are a few fteps leading up, 
in the infide of the wall. In the higher parts of the building, 
the windows are much larger. This callle is furrounded (ex- 
cept on the W. fide) by a deep natural hollow, in which the 
water had been dammed up by an artificial mound at each 
end. Confidering the advantages of its fituation, and the 
ftrength of its walls, which are about 8 feet thick at the foun- 
dation, this ftrong hold mult have been almoft impregnable by 
the antient modes of attack. According to Pennant, this caftle 
" was originally the feat of Dunenald, predeceffor of Thomas 
** Randolph, afterwards created Earl of Murray by Robert 
" Bruce ; when this caftle, with that of Auchincafs, near Mof- 
« far, was difpofed of to Douglas of Morton, predeceffor of the 
" Earls of Morton."

raifed for a confiderable number of years ; and, at granting 
new leafes, large graffums have been received. If the farms 
were let without grafiums, at the rate ufually paid for fimilar 
lands in this part of the country, it is fuppol'td the rental of 
this parifh would be about 1500 I. All the Duke of Queenf- 
berry's property here is under flricTt entail, and leales can be 
granted for no more than 19 years. 

Agriculture. — Till within thefe 20 years, little progrefs had 
been made in the cultivation of land in this parifli, or coun- 
try adjoining. Indeed, previous to that period, the means 
of cultivation were little known, or were not to be had. In 
this neighbourhood, no marl of any confequence has ever 
been difcovered, and very little lime was then ufed. The 
only manure, therefore, which the farmers had for their 
lands, was the dung produced by their cattle. This they 
very injudicioufly confined to a fmall part of their farm, 
generally near the houfes, called croft laud, which, being thus 
enriched, and almoft inceffantly cropped with oats or bear, 
became fo full of weeds, as to yield very bad returns. The 
principal part of the farms, though very improveable, was 
left entirely in a ftate of nature, covered with coarfe grafs or 
fliort heath, and grazed by a fmall breed of black cattle and 
fheep. 

The mode of hufbandry is now totally changed, and vaftly 
improved. About 20 years ago, Sir James Kirkpatrick be- 
gan to carry on with fpirit his limeworks in the neighbour- 
ing parifli of Clofeburn ; and, upon an extenfive fcale, fet an 
example to the whole furrounding country, of the beneficial 
effects of that manure when properly applied to land. His 
example was foon followed by others, and has been the 
means of bringing about an amazing improvement both in 
the produce and in the appearance of this country. The 

quantity 



of Morton. 153 

quantity of lime commonly allowed here to a Scotch acre is 
from 60 to 80 meafures, which cofts 9 d. per meafure at the 
lime-kilns, each meafure containing about 2\ Winchefter 
bufhels. 

The mode of cropping which is now pretty commonly 
adopted, and feems to anfwer well, is to lay the lime upon 
the land, when in pafture, a year before it is intended to be 
ploughed ; then take two crops of oats, a crop of potatoes or 
turnips, and fow it with grafs. feeds, along with barley or 
bear. If the ground has been heathy, it ought to be fallow- 
ed a year before any crop is fown upon it. Though experi- 
ence has fliown this courfe of hufbandry to be very advanta- 
geous, yet many of the farmers ftill continue to take too 
many crops of oats fucceffively, to the great detriment of the 
land, and, in the end, to their own hurt alio. The improve- 
ment of hufbandry, however, has, for fome years paft, been 
very rapid, and continues to advance and become more ge- 
neral. 

A light made Scotch plough is almoft the only one ufed, 
and is found to anfwer better than any other, the land being 
fomewhat ftony. Two horfes are generally fufiicient for the 
draught, except when ftiff ley ground is to be broken up ; 
in that cafe, three, and fometimes four, are neceffary. The 
number of acres annually in crop, as nearly as can be afcer- 
tained, is about 850; of which 575 are fown with oats, 42 
with barley, 30 with bear, 24 vfflk wheat, 30 with grey 
peafe, 4 with lint, 20 with turnips, 72 with potatoes, and 53 
with rye-grafs and clover. The produce is confiderably 
more than fufiicient to fupply the inhabitants, and the fur- 
plus is carried principally to Leadhills, Wanlockhead, and

two horfes and a plough, who have only a very fmall piece 
cf ground which they drefs, either by themfelves, or by 
joining with fome of their neighbours in the fame fituation. 
This occupies only a little of their time. During the reft,, 
they find abundance of employment in carting lime from 
Glofeburn, and coals from Sanquhar to the limeworks and 
to the town of Dumfries. The number of carts in the parifh 
is about 95. The ordinary cart-load of coals for a fingle 
horfe, which is the way they are almoft all drawn, is about 
12 cwt. 

Stock. — The frock in this parifh, which is pretty accurately 
afcertained, confifts of 119 horfes, 330 milch cows, 170 
young black cattle, 2527 fheep, and a few fwine, perhaps 40 
or 50, their number varying according to the goodnefs of 
the potatoe crop. The iheep are all of the fhort-faced kind, 
except fmall parcels of a mixed breed, feeding upon the low 
lands along with the cows *. 

Village. — The village of Thornhill is the only one defer- 
ving that name in the parifh, though there are two or three

* The price of provifions is much the fame here as in Dum- 
fries market. Only potatoes, which are a very great article of 
provifion, are generally fomewhat cheaper, as great crops of 
them are raifed in this dillricl ; and they cannot be carried to 
any great diftance for fale, on account of their weight. Their 
price varies from 8 d. to 1 s. 4d. per peck, which weighs abouc 
one cwt. Potatoes conflitute at lead one half of the food of the 
common people ; none can be cheaper, and it would appear, 
none more wholefome. 

The wages of a man fervant in the houfe are from 61. to 8 L 
per annum, befides victuals ;' of a woman fervant, from 2 I. 10 s. 
to 3I. 10s. The daily wages of a mafon are 20 d. of a joiner,

winter, and from is. to I4d. the reft of the year, without 
victuals. There arc no remains of feudal fervices in this parifh*

more clufters of houfes, or as they are vulgarly called, towns, 
-containing from 30 to 50 inhabitants each. Thornhill is 
•pleafantly fituated upon a dry riling ground, half a mile E. 
from the river Nith. It is regularly built in two ftreets, 
cxoffing each other at right angles. In the middle, where 
they cut one another, {lands a handfome crofs, or rather pil- 
lar, erefted by the late Duke of .Queen fberry. This village 
has greatly increaled of late. There were only 325 inhabi- 
tants in it in the year 1779. In 1791, they amounted to 
430, which is an increafe of one fourth in 12 years. During 
6 or 8 years previous to this period, its progrefs was as rapid, 
and it ftill continues to go on. The whole village belongs to 
the Duke of Queenfberry, who receives 5 s. 4d. of yearly 
rent for every houfe-ftead and garden. The villagers build 
their houfes entirely at their own expence. Abundance of 
free-ftone is to be had in the neighbourhood, and the other 
materials for building at no great diftance. All the houfes, 
6 or 7 excepted,^ conlift of only one florey. Some of them 
are covered with Hates, fome with thin free-ftones, but the. 
greater part with thatch. The expence of building a houfe 
of one ftcrey is from 1 2 1. to 20 I. according to the kind of 
roof and finifhing. Thole of two ftoreys coft from icol. tp

employment in Thornhill and its neighbourhood ; and thofc 
who have horfes, when not occupied in cultivating their finail 
farms, carry coals from Sanquhar for hire. In this village 
there are 4 fairs annually ; one in February, ojie in May, one 
in Auguft, and one in November. Each of them is on the 
fecond Tuefday of the month, old ftile. At thefe fairs, there 
are fold confiderable quantities both of coarfe woollen and linen 
.cloth, and yarn made in the neighbourhood. A great numbec

l\laiiufaElurcs. — It has often been the fubject of wonder, as 
well as of regret, that Thornhill, or its neighbourhood, has 
never been chofen by any perfon as a fituation for eftablifh- 
ing a manufacture. It certainly is extremely well adapted to 
that purpofe, infinitely more fo than many places where ma- 
nufactures flourifh in great perfection. The price of provi- 
fions is always confiderably lower than in Lanark or Renfrew 
fhires. The price of fuel is moderate ; for, though coals are 
brought from Sanquhar, 1 2 miles diftant, they are fold here 
at 4d. or t\\±. per cwt. and there is abundance of water in 
the Nith and Carron for driving machinery. Though the 
prevailing rage ieems now to be directed to the cotton manu- 
facture, wool, which is the ftaple of this country, feems a 
more natural object. 

Infjs, Roads, CSV — In Thornhill are two inns, and a confi,- 
derable number of dram-houfes, winch are by no means fa- 
vourable to the health or morals of the people. Two high 
roads crofs each other in this village ; the one leading from 
Dumfries to Ayrfhire and Glafgow by Sanquhar, and to 
Edinburgh by Leadhills ; the other going welhvard into Gal- 
loway by Minnyhive. The former was made a turnpike 
l,ift year, and is well directed and finifhed. Upon it are two 
bridges, one over Cample, and the other over Carron. On 
the road towards Galloway, there is a good bridge acrofs the 
Nith. The bye-roads through the parilh are but indifferent ; 
but now that the principal road is fupported by tolls, it is 
hoped they will be put into better order, the whole money 
arifing from the converfion of the ftatute labour being ap- 
plied to them.

Climatc and Difeafes. — A furgeon refides in this parifh, 
whofe medical practice extends over a large diftrict of coun- 
try around. The foil here being moftly dry, the air is pure 
and wholefomc. Agues are hardly known at all ; nor in- 
deed are there any difeafes to which the people are particu- 
larly fubject. Inoculation for the fmall-pox ha«, for a confi- 
derable number of years, been praclifed with the greateft 
fuccefs. It is now pretty general, and is continually becoming 
more fo, the prejudices of the people againft it giving way to 
the force of their happy experience. 

Ecclefiajlical State, Schools, and Poor. — The church was 
built about 12 years ago, and will contain 500 or 600 people. 
The manfe and offices are of longer {landing, and need con- 
fiderable repairs. The ftipend confifts of 5 81. 6 s. 8 d. and 
one chalder of victual, with 3 1. 6 s„ 8 d. for communion ele- 
ments. A confiderable augmentation will, it is hoped, foon 
be obtained. The glebe is of the extent required by law. 
The Duke of Queenfberry is patron. The fchoolmafter's 
falary is only ioo rnerks Scotch, which, with a houfe, a 
cow's grafs, 3 roods of croft land, and very fmall wages from 
the fcholars, is his whole provifion. The prefent fchool- 
mafter is a very old man ; and, when a vacancy fhall happen, 
it is hardly to be fuppofed that any perfon properly qualified 
will, for fuch trifling emoluments, be induced to become his 
•fucceffor. There is no body of men more ufeful than the 
parochial fchoolmafters, and there is none whofe allowance 
is generally more inadequate to their fituation. The poor 
are fupported by the collections made weekly at the church, 

and

an d by the intereft of a capital, which has been gradually 
accumulated, to the amount of 1501. by finall legacies and 
donations to the poor from charitable perfons. The Duke 
of Qneenfberry gives them 1 5 ftones of meal annually. The: 
number of poor upon the roll is commonly 9 or 10. A ge- 
neral diftribution in money is made half yearly by the kirk- 
feflion, befides intermediate difburfements to thofe whole 
circumftances require more frequent aid. The fums given 
to individuals vary, according to their Situation, from I 1. 4 s. 
to 3 1. and, in fome cafes, 4 1. a year. The poor here are, 
upon the whole, fupported fully as well as in any of the 
neighbouring parilhes, and hardly any of them ever go beg- 
ging through the country. 

Mifceilaneoits Obfervations. — Tn the Carron and Cample,, 
both of which run into the Nith, is good filhing for burn 
t routs. In the Nith, a considerable number of lea trouts 
and falmon are taken, and are ufually fold at 2 d. per pound, 
but are fomewhat inferior in quality to thofe caught nearer 
the mouth of the river. 

Upon the Carron are three milts j one for grinding oats, 
another for making barley, and the third for dreffing lint, 
To this mill lint is brought from the diftance of 15 or 16 
miles, as there is no other in this part of the country. In- 
deed, lint is not very much cultivated here, the foil being 
rather too light and fandy. 

Although this parifh is in nearly the fame latitude both 
with Penpont and Holywood, where the people are faid to 
be of an extraordinary ftature, yet the inhabitants are, in ge- 
neral, neither above nor below the common fize. In their 
manners and character there is nothing peculiar. They are 
juft as fober and induftrious as their neighbours j but it is to 
be regretted that the induflry of many of them is fo poorly

rewarded. Spinning out a {ingle thread from the wheel, 
with clofe application, they can hardly earn 3 d. a day ; 
whilft others in a different part of the country, without any 
greater exertion, availing themfelves of the ufeful machinery 
which has been invented to facilitate their work, earn four 
times the fum. 

The mod obvious and important improvements to be made 
in this par'dh are thefe two ; the introduction of manufac- 
tures, and dividing and inclofing the land with hedge-rows 
and belts of planting ; the former would give a better direc- 
tion to the induftry of the inhabitants, and greatly meliorate 
their condition ; the latter would at once beautify and im- 
prove the ccuntry.

NUMBER XI. 
PARIS-H OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4574983">ATHELSTANEFORD</name>. 

(County and Prejbytery of Haddington,— Synod of Lo- 
thian and Tweeddale.) 

By the Reverend Mr George GoLDIE. •</head> 

<p>* 

Name, Extent^ &amp;c. 

THE origin of the names of places is, in general, in- 
volved in great obfeurity, and has therefore occafion- 
ed much idle conjecture. The parifh of Athelftaneford is 
denominated from the village where the church ftands -, and, 
if any credit is due to Buchanan *, the village owes its name 
to the following incident. In one of the predatory incur- 
fions frequent at that early period, Athelitane (whom he fiip- 
pol'es to have been a Danifh chief, that had received a grant 
of Northumberland from King Alured) arrived in this part 
of the country ; and, in a battle with Hungus King of the 
Pifts, was pulled with violence from his horfe, and (lain. 
The rivulet where that battle was fought is in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the village, and is called Lug Down Burn, 
fuppoled to be a corruption of Rug Down. Buchanan far- 
ther adds, that Hungus, who was much inferior in every 
refpect to Athelilane, was encouraged to hazard this battle 
by a vifion of St Andrew the Apoftle the night preceding, 
Vol. X. X who

Statiflical Account 



who promifed him fuccefs ; and that the victory was facilita-* 
ted by the appearance of a crofs in the air, in the form of the 
letter X, as foon as the battle began. The village over 
which this miraculous appearance was feen, ftill retains the 
name of Martle, a contraction of miracle. Achaius King of 
the Scots, by whofe afliftance Hungus obtained this victory, 
(for he fent him 10,000 men, under the command of his fon 
Alpinus), in commemoration of the forefaid appearance of St 
Andrew's crofs, afterwards inftituted an order of knighthood 
in honour of St Andrew, who, in times of Popery, was reck- 
oned the tutelary faint of Scotland. This happened about 
the beginning of the ninth century. It is not certain at 
what period the original church of this place was built ; but 
it is well known, that, towards the end of the 12th century, 
the parifh churches of Athelftaneford and Crail in Fife, with 
their tithes, were annexed to the monaftery of St Martin, in 
the parifh of Haddington, by Malcolm IV. This was pro- 
bably done in honour of the memory of his mother Ada, 
Countefs of Northumberland, who founded that monaftery. 

Athelftaneford is divided from the parifh of Haddington 
on the S. and S. W. by the fmali rivulet formerly mention- 
ed, called Lug Down Burn. This rivulet rifes in the Garle- 
ton Hills, and falls into the Frith of Forth on the N. fide of 
Tynningham Bay. On the N. this parifh is feparated from 
that of Dirleton by another finall rivulet, called Pfffer. This 
rivulet rifes in the N. E. corner of the parifh, and divides 
into two ftreams at its fource. The lands are lb fiat in that 
particular part of the country, that one of thefe ftreams runs 
in an eafterly direction, and, after mingling its waters with 
.Lug Down Burn, empties itfelf into the Frith of Forth; 
the other runs due W. into the Frith of Forth at Aberlady 
Bay. The ground rifes gradually from this rivulet to the 
fouthern extremity of the parifh, where the village of Athel- 
ftaneford 



■of Athelflaneforft. 1C3 

flaneford and the church (land. The form of the parifh is 
regular, being nearly an oblong fquare, about 4 miles in 
length, from W. to E. and between 2 and 3 miles in breadth, 
from S. to N. with the addition of a few acres that interfere 
the parifhes of Haddington and Preftonkirk, on the S. E. 
corner. It was originally one of the fmalleft parilhes in 
Scotland, and did not contain above 800 or tooo acres. 
So late as 1650, this was the whole extent of it; and the 
Earl of Wintoun was the fole proprietor of all the lands. 
At that period it was confklerably enlarged, feveral fa'ms 
having been disjoined from the parifli of Haddington and 
annexed to it ; and a £1 ill greater proportion of lands were 
disjoined from the parilh of Preftonkirk on the E. and anr 
nexed ; fo that the whole extent of the parifli is now frona 
3500 to 4000 acres. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifli is 4 r 54 1. is. Scotch. 
One third of this valuation is the property of Sir David Kin- 
loch of Gilmerton, another third belongs to the Earl of 
Hopetoun and the Honourable Charles Hope ; the remain- 
ing third is divided among the Earls of Wemyfs, Aberdeen, 
and Elibank. The real rent cannot be afcertained exactly, 
a confiderable part being payable in kind, and confequently 
varying with the prices of grain ; but, when compared with, 
the prefent advanced rents of land in this country, the farms 
in this parifh vre generally allowed to be good bargains. 
This circumftar.ee, however, is not attended with any of 
thofe bad conlequences which landlords of felfifh views fool- 
iflily fufpeft, and wifh to make the world believe. It neither 
incourages indolence, nor produces -.; fpirit of infolence. The 
reverfe is the faft. It preferves and cherilhes that bond of 
affeflion which ought always to fubfift between landlords and 
their tenants. The farmers look up to their fuperiors with 

the 



Statiftical Account 

the moft grateful refpecl:, and carry on their improvements 
with fpint and fuccels. They can afford to live f'uitably to 
their ftation, to educate their families properly, and make 
decent provilion for them in life. 

Soil, Cultivation , C5V. — The foil is of an excellent quality, 
being, in general, a tight loam. This, however, admits of 
exceptions, fome parts being gravelly, and others inclining to 
clay. Almoft the whole Lnds in the pariih are arable, and 
have been occafionally in tillage. But when this is laid, it 
ought to be added, that fome of the lands that have been 
occafionally in tillage, would have turned out more for the 
intereft of both landlord and tenant if they had been inclofcd 
and planted ; they would have afforded fhelter to the better 
lands, which is much wanted, yielded a fufficient lupply of - 
wood for the purpoles of hufbandry, and added much to the 
bsauty of the country. There is the beft reafon to believe, 
that planting would thrive on fome of thofe lands, from a 
trial that has been lately made by a tenant in an adjoining 
parifh, on lands of a fimilar quality ; and his plantation is at 
prefent in a very thriving fiate. There are few parifhes in 
Scotland of the fame extent, equally- diftant from the lea, 
and without the reach of adventitious manure, that can boafb 
of a larger proportion of good land. What are commonly 
called the in-fields of Athelftaneford, have been long confi- • 
dered as among the beft in Eaft Lothian. They have a 
beautiful fouth expofrire ; they produce the earlieft and the 
beft grafs, and are well known to feed -better than almoft 
any other. The lands in the parifh are, in general, in a 
high ftate of cultivation, and produce rich crops of every 
ffteeles of grain, particularly wheat, barley, and oats. The 
introduftion of drilled crops, which happened within thefe 
laft 30 years, has been of lingular ufe in this parifh. The 

farmer 



of AihelJIaneford. 

farmer has It now in his power to keep his land much clean- 
er than he formerly could do. The feeding of cattle on tur- 
nips gives him an additional quantity of manure ; and, what 
is perhaps of greater value, the potching of the land, in car- 
rying off the turnips for feeding cattle, or in eating them 
with fheep upon the ground, has been found to be a more 
effectual method of extirpating the annual weeds with which 
the lands were formerly much infefted, than any other with 
which they were formerly acquainted. Befides turnips, a con- 
fiderable quantity of potatoes are raifed, which are a great 
bleffing to the lower clafs of people. Of late, there was a 
coarfe kind of potatoe introduced here, called the yam, not, 
as is fuppofed, the real American yam, but the Surinam po- 
tatoe, confiderably larger than the common one, forae of 
them weighing above 2 pounds. They are more prolific 
than the common potatoe, an acre of land properly prepared 
generally producing from 80 to 100 bolls. The ftem grows 
very luxuriantly, and therefore they fhould never be planted 
clofer than 3 feet between the rows, and 18 inches in the 
row. Cattle are uncommonly fond of them, and they are 
found to feed well. They are particularly proper to be given 
to milch cows, increafing the quantity of milk, without any 
injury to the tafte, and improving the butter both in colour 
and flavour. 

There are 16 farms in the parifh, one of which is in 
the natural pofTeffion of one of the proprietors, and three 
are pofTefTed by farmers who do not refide on them. There 
is one farm of about 500 acres, another of 350, and a third 
of about 300. The reft are from 150 to 200 acres each, 
with the exception of one that is only about 50. A consider- 
able part of the parifh is inclofed, but there ft ill remains a 
good deal to be done in that way. From their vicinity to 
Haddington, the farmers can difpofe of the various produce

of their farms to great advantage, and at fmall expence. A 
confidcrable part of their grain, is bought by agents for 
the corn- merchants in Leith, Edinburgh, and Glafgow, and 
carried to the port of North Berwick, and from thence con- 
veyed in (hipping to different parts of Scotland. The num- 
ber of ploughs in. the parifh, according to the ftatute work, 
is 47^. The Englifh plough is chiefly ufed, and drawn by 
two horfes. There are in the parifh, about 50 two horfe, 
and 6 one horfe carts, and 1 coach. Betides the horfes ufed 
in agriculture, &amp;x. there are fome kept fblely for riding ; 
and, of late, owing to the high prices of horfes, the farmers 
have begun to rear young ones, partly for fale, but chiefly 
for the fupport of their own flock. The whole number of 
horfes, young and old, is from 150 to 160 •, they are of an 
excellent kind, not large, but very adlive, and fit to do a 
great deal of work. The number of milch cows is about 
160. The reft of the black cattle exceeds that number con- 
flderably, and varies in different feafons. There is often a 
great number of Highland ftots, over and above the black 
cattle reared by themfelves, kept by the farmers in their 
ftraw-yards through the winter, and fed off in fummer in 
grafs parks, which they take annually for that and other 
purpofes. Of late years, there have been from 35 10 40 
icores of fheep in the parifh, a greater number than formerly, 
a larger proportion of land having been in grafs. 

Population. — The population of this parifh has, upon the 
whole, decreafed within thefe 14 years paft. This is owing 
to the fame general caufes that have operated in other parts 
of the country, the monopolizing of farms, the introduction 
of two horie ploughs, and a greater proportion of lands be- 
ing kept in grafs. Upon the three farms formerly mention- 
ed, poffeffed by farmers who do not refide on them, the de- 

crcafe

While the number of fouls in the parifh, in general, has di- 
minifhed, the population of the village of Athelftaneford has 
increafed very much. In the 1778, the number of inhabi- 
ted houfes was 71, containing 295 inhabitants. In 1792, 
the number of inhabited houfes is 92, containing 387 inha- 
bitants, an increale of 21 houfes and 92 fouls. The increafc 
of buildings and of inhabitants in the village is owing to the 
liberal encouragement given by Sir David Kinloch of Gil- 
merton, the proprietor, to people to fettle on his eftate. 
The houfes are built upon a feu-tack of 38 years, at the ex- 
pence of the people, who pay to the proprietor a trifle an- 
nually for the ground on which the houfe ftands. They 
have large gardens, of an excellent foil, at the fame propor- 
tion of rent which a farmer would chearfully pay for it. 
Befides this, the feuers of thefe houfes hold, in a conjunct 
leafe, about ico acres of good land at a moderate rent. This 

land

land is divided among them into fmall lots. Two of their 
number have each a pair of horfes. With thefe they labour 
the land for the community at a reafonable hire, and drive 
coals and other carriages that are necelfary for the village. 
With the produce of this land the inhabitants fupply them- 
felves with meal and potatoes, and many of them have it in 
their power to keep a cow. In this manner they are enabled 
to live comfortably, to clothe and educate their children de- 
cently, and to affift in fetting them out in the world. There 
is no village in this country where the inhabitants have im- 
proved more of late years in comfort and convenience than 
in the village of Athelftaneford. Formerly, their dwellings 
were no better than fmall, dirty, dark hovels ; now they are 
all neat, commodious houfes, generally with two apartments, 
and well lighted. The expence of building one of thefe hou- 
fes is from 15 1. to 20 1. ; and fome, that are larger and bet- 
ter finifhed, coll: confiderably more. In point of fituation, 
the village is truly beautiful. It ftands open and elevated, 
and commands the nioft delightful and extenfive profpedts.

number of inhabitants, of different profeffions in life, to fet-

on his cftatc, the numerous inhabitants of which look up to

him with gratitude as their guardian and benefactor, always 
ready to advife, protect, and affift them. 

Climate, &amp;c— From the elevated fituation of the village, 
and the open ftate of the parifh in general, the inhabitants 
are very healthy. No epidemical diftempers of any kind, ex- 
cepting the common dii'eafes incident to children, are known ; 
and deaths are chiefly confined to infancy and old age. 
Many inftances of longevity have occurred. One man died, 
about a year ago at the age of 90, and feveral above 80. 
There are, at pre fen t, in the parifh, 10 perfons above 80, 
all of them healthy and active. The practice of inoculation 
is become general among perfons of better ftation ; and it is 
attended with the happieff effects, not one child having ever 
died under that management, The common people (till re- 
tain ftrong prejudices againft it, and. they often fuffer fevere- 
ly for their obftinacy. About two years ago, out of 20 chil- 
dren in the village who took the fmall-pox in the natural 
way, no fewer than 5 died ; while all who were inoculated had 
them in the moft favourable way, and recovered immediardy. 
A fact of this kind, fo well known, and with which the lives 
of children are fo efTentulIy connected, one would imagine 
muft overcome the moft obftinate prejudices. It may be pro- 
per to obferve, that befides people in the other lines of life 
that are fettled in the village, there is a baker and a brewer. 
But, among the other advantages which this village and pa- 
rifh enjoys, there is one that deferves particular notice. One 
of the beft butcher markets in Scotland is eftablifhed here. 
It was originally fet up under the patronage of the late Sir 
Francis Kinloch of Gilmerton, and has been carried on with 
fuccefs for more than 60 years by the fame man, who, during 
that long period, has been univerfally refpedted for his inte- 
grity and franknefs in dealing. He was among the firfl

graziers in this country. When in the vigour of life, he 
pofleflcd uncommon fpirit and activity, and carried on bufi- 
nefs as a grazier and butcher to greater extent than any other 
individual in Eaft Lothian. Of late, he has wifely contracted 
his bufinefs to a finaller fcale, but ftill fupplies the parilh and 
neighbourhood with every kind of butcher meat in the fea- 
fon, of the beft quality; beef from 3 d. to 4^ d. per lib. mut- 
ton, veal, and lamb, in proportion. He is now in the 84th 
year of his age, healthy and active, with ftill a " fparlc of 
" youthful fire." A woollen manufacture of ftriped varie- 
gated cloth has been carried on in the village for fome years 
paft, on a fmall fcale. The cloth fells from 4 s. 6. d. to 5 s. 
6 d; per vard. It is made of the beft materials, is efteemed a 
light, genteel, and crmfortable drefs, and is known in Edin- 
burgh by the name of the Gilmer ton Livery. The demand 
for it increafes, the manufacturer has both fpirit and ftock to 
carry it on to greater extent, but finds great difficulty in pro- 
curing female hinds to prepare the materials. Accuftomed 
from their early years to work in the fields in weeding the 
corn, hoeing, &amp;c. they prefer what they call outwork in 
i'uminer to any domeftic employment *. 

Poor. 



* Though perfons of diftinguifhed characters are not produ- 
ced in every age and in every foil, yet it is well known that this 
parifli has produced men of eminent abilities in different pro- 
feffions of life. Towards the end of the 16th, and beginning 
of the 1 7th century, a great part of the lower lands of Eatt 
Lothian were porTeffed by the Hepburns, collateral branches of 
the Earls of Bothwell. A gentleman of that name was propri- 
etor of the lands of Athelllaneford. A fecond fon of his went 
into the Swediih fervice. General Lefly, in paffing through 
this country at the head of a company, on their way to embark 
to join Guftavus Adolphus, then at the head of the Proteitant 
League in Germany againft the Emperor Ferdinand II. faw

was tall and handfome), and fpoke to him in a manner that

roufed the fpirit of the young hero, and he immediately joined 
the party. He foon dift'mguiihed himfelf by his military talents, 
and rofe to the rank of colonel of the Scotch Brigade. In that 
command he performed many important fervices, and often re- 
ceived public praife from Gullavus for his gallant conduct. He 
afterwards went into the French fervice, and died a Field M ir- 
ihal of France. But, though few pofl'efs talents to diltinguiih 
themfelves by fuch fplendid atchievernents as Hepburn, or have 
opportunities of rifmg to fuch eminent rank, yet there are men 
who, in the humbler paths of life, have opportunities of per- 
forming fervices of great general utility, and of effential impor- 
tance to the improvement of their country ; and, if it is a juft 
obfervation, as it certainly is, That the man who makes " two 
" blades of grafs, and two ears of corn grow where only one 
*« grew before," deferves to be ranked among the benefactors 
of mankind, it would be improper not to mention in a publica- 
tion of this nature, (meant to mark the progrefs of improve- 
ment in this country), the following character. His name, 
which deferves to be handed down to polierity, was John Wal- 
ker. Ir. is not certain that he was a native of this parifh ; but 
he po/Tefled land, to a conhderable extent, both in this and a 
neighbouring p.irifh, and was the firlt farmer in this country 
who either fallowed an acre of land, or lowed a boll of wheat, 
on what is commonly called outfield land. He took the hint 
from an Englifli gentleman travelling in this country. When 
he began the experiment, many of his neighbours laughed at 
his feeming folly, while his more immediate connections were 
alarmed at the circumltance of his not fowing his fields, and 
confidered it as a fymptom of poverty. His crop exceeded his 
moll fanguine expectations, and jullilied the wifdom of his con- 
duct ; and his neighbours had the good fenfe to follow his ex- 
ample. This experiment was made in .the parifh of Prcflonkirk, 
on the eftate ot Beanlton, now the property of the Earl of 
Wemyfs, and happened towards the end of the lait century. Some 
years after this, perhaps more than ao, the fowing of clover and 
other grafs feeds was introduced into this country by the Earl of 
Haddington, grandfather of the prefent nobleman. Thefe were 
the firft, and v. ill probably prove the molt important and per- 
manent, of all improvements in modern hufbandry. Robert

for the fupport of the poor. The public funds are ample, 
and fully adequate to that purpofe. The number upon the 
poor's roll is from 1 2 to 15, who are regularly fupplied every 
quarter. Befides thofe upon the roll, there are others who 
receive occafional fupply in coals, in the payment of their 
houfe rents, and are affifted in educating their children. The 
common people, in general, are afhamed to receive public 
charity. In order to preferve this fenfe of fhame, which is 
one of the bell guardians of virtue, the kirk-feffion give a 
power to the farmers to give fuch of their dependents as are 
in want, corn and other neceharies which they may judge 
proper, for which they are paid out of the public funds. 
At other times, fome of them that are in diftrefs, are reliev- 
ed by giving them money in the way of loan, which they are

that high department in the law with much honour to himfclf, 
and advantage to his country, is a native or this place. His 
father was minifler of this parifli, a gentleman eminent for his 
learning and piety. He poflelfed conliderable poetical talents., 
and was aathor of a fmall poem, entitled, The Grave, much 
admired for its elegance and poetical merit. The firft modern 
tragedy in the linglifli language was written by the celebrated 
author of it when minilter of this parifli. When this is faid, it 
is almoll unneceflary to add, that the Tragedy of Douglas, 
written by Mr John Home, is here meant ; for it is universally 
allowed, that the tragic mufe never wears her " Weeds of 
" Woe" fo gracefully, or with fuch happy effect, as in the 
character of Lady Randolph. Mr Home was 10 years minilter 
of this pariih ; and, during his incumbency, was not iefs ad- 
mired as a preacher, than he has been fince as a poet. Upon 
demitting his charge, he built an elegant villa in the parifli, and 
laid out the g ound about it with great tafte. It adds much* 
to the beauty of this place. Painting, too, the filler art of po- 
etry, has been cultivated here with taile and advantage. The 
fon of a refpectable farmer in this parifli, from his earlieft years 
difcovered a remarkable genius for drawing and painting. As 
he advanced in life, he applied chiefly to miniatures, in which 
he excelled. For thefe feveral years pall, he has been in Italy ; 
and there is good reafon to believe that he ranks among the 
$rfl; artifls in that country. ^

allowed to repay when able. In this manner their wants are 
implied, and their feelings not hurt. Even in the 1782, a 
feafon of uncommon calamity in many parifh.es, the poor here 
were well taken care of. They got a fmall addition to their 
former allowance, and were comfortable. The annual expen- 
diture, above 60 1. arifes from the intereft of money, collec- 
tions at the church- door, the ufe of the mort- cloth, and of a 
hearfe. But, though there are no beggars in this parifh, it 
is often much harrafled by vagrant poor from other parifhes. 
This is certainly a very great defect in the police of this 
county which ought to be remedied. 

Schools. — There are two public fchools in this parifh. The 
parochial fchool is eftablifhed in the village of Athelftane- 
ford. The fchoolmafter has the legal falary of 100 merks. 
He is precentor, feffion clerk, and collector of the money for 
the ftatute labour in the parifh, which is a fmall addition. 
He is well qualified to teach Englifh, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, mathematics, and the Latin, Greek, and 
French languages. His fcholars are very numerous, general, 
ly from 60 to 80, and fometimes more. But, with all his 
attention and induftry, his annual income will not exceed 
30 1. Sterling. This, which is affluence when compared 
with the average livings of the fchoolmafters in Scotland, is 
but fmall encouragement for a man of merit, who has recei- 
ved a liberal education. It is indeed much to be regretted, 
that fo ulcful a clafs of men fhould be fo poorly rewarded 
for their laborious fervices ; and it reflects no honour upon 
the landed intereft of Scotland, that, in the late attempt the 
fchoolmafters made to get fome addition to their livings, they 
met with fuch violent and determined oppofition. If the 
wifdom of the legiflature, an hundred years ago, thought it 
proper and neceflary to allow them a fmall falary, furely It

cannot be unworthy of the fame wifdoin, in the prefent en- 
lightened and profperous (late of this country, to do fomc- 
thing to make their incomes keep pace, in fome meafure, with 
the other orders in fociety. If fomething of this kind is not 
done, there is reafon to apprehend, that, within a few years, 
many pariflies in Scotland will not be able to find men fuffi- 
ciently qualified to fuperintend the education of youth. The 
confequences of this are as obvious as they are alarming. 
Gothic ignorance forebodes nothing friendly either to private 
happinefs or national improvement. The other fchool in 
this parifh is in the village of Drem. The late Earl of Hope- 
toun, with that generofity and attention to the comfort of his 
dependents which ftrongly marked his Lordfhip's character, 
allowed the fchoolmafter i boll barley, i boll oats, and i 
boll peafe, with maintenance for a cow, fuinmer and winter, 
by way of falary. He has likewife a free houfe and garden. 
The fcholars are taught reading EngliJh, writing,, and arith- 
metic, and are generally from 30 to 50. There is likewife a 
female teacher in the village of Athelfianeford, for inftructing 
girls in fewing, working lace, &amp;c She, too, is allowed a 
free houfe and a fmall falary. 

Ecclefiaftical State. — The church, manfe, fchool-houfe, and 
fchoolmafter's houfe, have all been new built within thefe 
laft 1 2 years, and all of them after the moft approved plans ; 
fo that there is no parifh in Scotland better accommodated 
in thefe refpects. The ftipend is 8 bolls wheat, 16 bolls 
barley, 32 boils oats, 750 1. Scotch, (including 50 1. for com- 
munion elements), with 25 merks Scotch, as the intereft of 
500 merks mortified money on the efiate of Monkridge, iu 
the parifh of Haddington, by Mrs Hepburn, of pious me- 
mory. Sir David Kinloch of Gilmerton is patron, and is the 
only one of 6 heritors that refides in the parifh.

Mtfdhneous Obfervations.—Tht only antiquities in this pa- 
rifh are the veftige of a camp, feemingly Danifh, concerning 
which there is no tradition, and hiltory is filent j and the 
remains of a chapel; called 5/ John's Chapel, which belonged 
to the Knights Templars. Thefe are both on the property 
of the Earl of Hopetoun. The houfe of Garleton, too, may 
be mentioned under this head. It appears to have been a 
place of magnificence, but is now almoft in ruins. It is 
beautifully fituated at the foot of the Garleton Hills, at the 
weft end of a large ftrath of fertile land, and commands a 
delightful profpect of a 'large proportion of the lower lands 
of Eaft Lothian. 

There are four alehoufes in the parifh, but they are at- 
tended with no bad confequences either to the health or the 
morals of the people ; they are, what they ought to be* 
places of accommodation for travellers, or for traniafting ne- 
ceffary buiinefs. There are two corn-mills ; one upon the 
eftate of Sir David Kinloeh, the other upon the property of 
the Earl of Hopetoun. Their refpeclive tenants are thirled, 
to thefe mills, which is fometimes complained of as a griev- 
ance, but certainly without good reafpn, lince the thirlage 
ought to be coniidered as a part of their rent ; at the fame 
time, it muft be confeffed, that it would be much better if 
every lervitude of this kind was done away. There are three 
fmiths in the parifh, and tradefmen of every kind connected 
with the improvements in hufbandry. The prices of labour 
and provifions are almoft double of what they were 40 years 
ago. This is one of the many other proofs that might be 
given of the flourifhing ftate of the country. 

The inhabitants of this parifh have been long remarkable 
for the liberality of their fentiments in religious matters. 
They are exemplary in their attendance upon the ordinances 
of religion, and uncommonly decent in their behaviour upon 

thefe 



Statlftical Account 



thefe occafions. Thofc in a better ftation are attentive to 
the comfort of their dependents. In their focial intercourfe, 
they are kind without affectation, and hofpitable without ex- 
travagance. The lower clafs are fober, peaceable, and in- 
duftrious. Upon the whole, there are few parifhes in Scot- 
land that enjoy greater advantages than the parifh of Athel- 
ftaneford, and none in which the people, in general, are 
more comfortable, contented, and happy.

<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

THE termination urd is from the Celtic language, anil 
fignifies a quarter or fourth part ; hence the following 
delcription or places at each extremity of the parifh, Kirkurd, 
Ladyurd, Netherurd, and Lochurd. The length 01 the pa- 
rifh, from E. to W. is 5^ Enghfh miles ; and its breadth, 
from N. to S. from 3 to 4. 1 he .parilh, m general, prelents 
a lurtace finely diveriitied ; and, what is remarkable in a hilly 
country, fuch as Tweeddale generally is, the low or arable 
land bears aluioft an equal proportion, in point of extent, to 
the high or Iheep grounds. The parilh, from adtual iurvey,, 
contains 6620 acres, Englifh meafure. The foil is of diffe- 
rent kinds. Towards the fmall river Tanh, it is moftly 
loam ; in one large farm we meet with clay ; but the pre- 
vailing foil is gravelifh. The light foil is preferable for 
crops, as the parifh lies in general high, being upward?- if 
6co feet above the level of the lea. Though the air is fharp, 
it is pure ; nd healthful. Dittempers are far from being fre- 
quent. Rheumatifm is the molt prevalent. This is, in a 
great meafure, owing to the little attention that is paid to 
Vol. X. % warm 



*7"8 Sta'tifiical Account 

warm and dry clothing, and to the cold and uncomfortable 
houfes of the poorer claffes. Though there are no remark- 
able inftances of longevity, except one man who died about 
10 years ago, whofe age was 92, (he was born in the parifh, 
and refided in it all his life), yet the inhabitants arrive, in 
general, to a good age. 

Rivers and Hills. — The Tarth runs along the north end of 
the parifh, and divides it from Linton and Newlands. It 
abounds with a trout of a fuperior fize and flavour from what 
is caught in the neighbouring rivers, owing perhaps to the 
ltillneis with which the river flows, and the abundant provi- 
iion to be met with in its numerous pools. A few large 
trout or fmall falmon come up this ftream from the Tweed 
after a flood j but, as they only appear in fpawning time, 
they are unwholefome food. 

The higheft hill is Hell's Cleugh, on the fummit of which 
is a fmall cairn, called the Pyked JIane, the boundary of three 
paiifhes, viz. Stobo, Broughton, and Kirkurd. From this 
cairn is a view of the country beyond the Forth, and a chain 
of mountains, from the eaft part of fife, as far as Dunbar- 
tonihire. South of the Forth, the view extends as far eaft 
as North Berwick ; hkewife to the Eildon Hills near Melrofe, 
and Cheviot Hills in Northumberland. The height of this 
hill above the level of the fea was found by Captain Arm- 
ftrong, who made a lurvey of the county, to be 2100 feet. 

- Proprietors. — There are four heritors, of whom only one 
refides at prefent in the parifh. Mr Carmichael of Skirling, 
and Mr Lawfon of Cairnmuir, have their principal feats here. 
The nianfion-houfe of Kirkurd is a modern building, with 
an extenfive policy. In the gardens are a green-houfe, an 
ice-houfe, and 3 fmall hot-houfes. This place was vaftly 

beautified

eftates, to his grandnephew John Carmichael of Skirling. 
Mr Lawfon has lately built at New Cairnmuir, or Netber- 
urd, a large and elegant hou.fe. Around it are feveral inclo- 
lures and plantations of value.

Agriculture, &amp;c. — About 480 acres are kept in tillage. 
The common mode of farming in the croft land, (which re- 
ceives all the houfe dung of the farms), is to have a third 
part und^r peafe, potatoes, and turnips, as cleaning an J meli- 
orating crop* ; which third, the fucceeding year (if not dung- 
ed with the cleaning. crops) is dung d for bear, and next 
year is fown witn uats. Glover, and, in a great meafure, 
turnip 1 , arc excluded 'rom the rotation, from the want of 
inclofires, and the difficulty of defending them from the 
fheep in winter. T.^re may be about 240 acres of croft 
managed in thi? wi), viz. 80 in peaie, potatoes, turnips, and 
lint, 80 in bsar, and 80 in oats, in a year. The remaining 
240 cert's unJer tillage are outfield, and are manured by the 
cattle folded at night in fumtner, to keep them from the 
growing corns. The folds are inclo-ures made of fod, at 
the expence of about 1 1 d. or 2d the running rood of 6 
yards, at 4! feet in height. The leys intended to be brought 
into tillage arc mcLfed in this manner early in the fpring  
the fheep and black cattle are kept in diftinc"! folds ; and 10 
fcore ot fheep may dung in this way about 3 acres in a fea- 
fon, VViicn the corns are got off the fields in harveft, the 
folds are levd e 1, and tne ground ploughed. Three crops of 
oats are, in general, t..kcn luccelfively after folding; but, 
when the folded land is alio limed on the fward, 5 crops are 
fometimes taken. Ihc land is then left to collect fward as 

it 



of Kirkurd. 



ft naay. This is the general defcription of the treatment of 
the land in tillage ; but there are feveral exceptions, where 
a better fyftem is introduced ; and the Norfolk fyftem of a 
rotation of four, feems to be approved of, where there is op- 
portunity to carry it into' practice. In a' few inftances, the 
dairy forming has been introduced as the chief article of 
profit. 

The Scotch plough is generally ufed, with two firong 
horfes, except in 4 instances with four. Small's plough has- 
like wife been introduced-. The horles, ^oung and old, in 
this parifh, will amount to about 70. A few are reared for the 
market, and fold when young ; but the generality is for pri- 
vate ule, and to fupply the wafte of the old. Thirty head of 
black cattle, at an average of 41. each, may be iold yearly. 
The milch cows are, at an average, from 16 to 28 fton; 
weight. They produce from 4 to io Scotch pints of milk 
per day, a few 16 or 18-. The lheep are of the common 
Scotch breed. The number that can be Ipared is fold at 
different periods. In April, when big with young, at iol. 
or 11 1. per fcore ; in September, to the butcher, or for fur- 
ther feeding, about 7 1. per fcore. 1 he lambs are fold in 
July from a 1. 10 s. to 4I. per fcore. What remains after 
thrle different drawings, (as they are termed), are kept for 
ftock •, they are all laid with butter or oil, and tar, about 
Martinmas. The wool of late years has been rapidly rifing 
in value. It was fold Lift year, after being wafhed, at 6 s tt 
4d. and 6 s. 6d. per ftonej 7 or 8 fleeces of the walhed 
wool generally go to the Hone. 

Between 500 and 600 acres of land are inclofed, a confi- 
derable part of which is well ftieltered with trees, and fuffi- 
ciently watered. This land, on an average, may be worth 
id s. per acre. About 1 50 of thefe acres, divided into parks 
of different fizes, command, by grazing, i6ol. per annum. 

The 



182 Statijlical Account 

The lands are inclofed by hedge and ditch. The hedges 
and ditches are frequently in double rows, at the diftance of 
a few feet from each other. 

There are many valuable plantations both of the different 
kinds of hard wood, and the various fpecies of fir. Some of 
thele are arrived at their full growth, and young trees are 
gradually coming up to fupply the walte of the old. The 
number of acres planted will amount to upwards of 200. 
There are no natural woods in the parifh *. 

Services, cjrV — A few fervices are ftill performed by the 
tenants, fuch as driving of coals, calling, winnowing, and 
driving peats home. There are a confiderable number, too, 
of kain hens paid. There is a public-houfe in the parifh 
for the accommodation of travellers. It has no bad effect on 
the morals of the people, who are, in general, a fet of fober 
and induftrious men. Two great roads pafs through this 
parifh, the one from Edinburgh to Moffat, the other, lately 
made, from Peebles to Glafgow. They are upheld by road- 
makers, and are kept in tolerable repair. The ftatute labour

* In confequence of manufactures eftablifhed in this, and 
particularly in the neighbouring county, there is a great de- 
mand for work people. Servants have of courfe become ra- 
ther fcarce in this part of the country. The wages are rifing 
every year. A good ploughman earns 6 guineas, or upwards, 
and female fervants from 31, to 4 1, per annum, with their vic- 
tuals. There is no market here for provilions. The butcher 
meat is brought from Peebles, Biggar, or Edinburgh. Butter 
is fold, in general, at 8d. per lib. ; ewe milk cheefe at 6 s. 6d. 
cow milk at 4s. per ftone ; eggs in fummer, 4d. in winter, 6d. 
per dozen j chickens 8 d. a pair ; hens 1 s. ducks iod. a piece. 
Day-labourers earn per day, in winter, 6 d. in fummer 8d. with 
their visuals. Ditches, cafting, and operations of that kind, 
are generally done by the piece, from 9d. to 1 s. the running

Eccleftajucal State. — The church was rebuilt in 1766, when 
it was removed about half a mile weilward from its former 
fituation in Kirkurd policy. Around it there is a piece of 
ground appropriated fcr burying ; bu-, though this burial- 
ground has been now opened tor upwards of 20 years, the 
old church-yard, for various reafons, is ftill very much ufed. 
The ftipend, with the addition of a irianfe, and a glebe of 
tg acres, will amount to upwards of 80 1. Sterling. The 
manfe, offices, and glebe, which were formerly at a confider- 
able diftance from both kirks, are now in the neighbourhood 
of the new. The manfe and offices were all new built in 
r/88. The greatest part of the new glebe (which was ex- 
cambed for the old) has been inclofed by the minifter, at his 
own expence, with hedge and ditch. John Carmichael, Eiqj 
of Skirling is patron. 

Poor. — As there are no rates, the poor are fupported from 
the weekly collections in the church, by dues at proclamations 
for marriage, by dues for mort-cloths, and the intereft of a 
capital of 140I. at 5 per cent.

The meal was exceedingly bad, and fold at 2 1. 5 s. per load. 

The 



StatiJIkal Account 



The farmers Curtained great loffes, after all the deductions 
that was made of their rents by the lairds. They bought the 
whole of their feed-oats next lprmg from Lothian and Rox- 
burghihire. One heritor coum.ffioned a conliderable quan- 
tity of oats from Lffex, fowed part of them himielf, and dif- 
tnbuted part among his tenants. The kirk-leihon bought 
fevcr-d loads of oat-meal, and fold it to cottars and houle- 
hoiuer* at is. the peck. This, with the white beans Drought 
from Leith, gave great relief, they have relolvid this year 
(1792) to lay up a few loads of oat and bear meal, and icll 
it out at a reduced price, in caie thefe articles lhould rile to 
an extravagant rate. 

A fociety was eltablifhed in this parifh 6 years ago, named 
the Ktrkurd Friendly Society, in crder to raife a fund for the 
relief of diltrefled members. Each member pays 2 s. at en- 
try, and 4 s. 4d. a year, and continues 3 years before he re- 
ceives any benefit ; at the end of which time, if he is unable 
to work, is entitled to 2 s. per week, The capital is now 
80 I. As the fund mcreales, they intend to make a fmall 
provifion for their widows. For the two lait years, the 
clergy have countena ced this bociety, by giving a iermon at 
the annual meeting. The collection at that time is for be- 
hoof of the Society. 

School. — The fchoolmafrer's falary is 81 6 s. 8d. with a 
Iioule and garden. The fchool and fchool matter's houfe 
were all new built, with flated roofs, in 1773. The number 
of fchohirs, at an average, is about 2c. lhe fchool wages are, 
for reading, 1 s. per quarter ; for writing, 1 s. 6 d ; for arith- 
metic. 2 s. The fchoolmafter is alio fefiion-clerk and pre- 
centor, whofe falary is 1 1. per annum, befides perquifites, for

ting teftimonials, amounting to about 10 s. yearly at an ave- 
rage. 

Mifcellaneotts Obfervations '. — There is a copious fulphureous 
fpring near Kirkurd- houfe. A chemiCal analyfis was made 
of it fome years ago by fjr Black of Edinburgh, by which it 
was found to be ftronger than the fulphureous water at Mof- 
fat, but weaker than that at Harrogate. Jt has been ufed of 
late with fuccefs in feveral diftempers. Coal, peat, and turf, 
are all ufed here for fuel. In gentlemens families, coals are 
always burnt ; they are fituared at 8 or 9 miles diftance. 
Peats, to a great extent and depth, and of a very fuperior 
quality, are found in one farm in this parifh ; they are not 
• caft. The tenants have a privilege of calling peats in diffe- 
rent molTes in the parifh of Linton, and confequently avail 
themfelves of that privilege. 

Until 1752, the large eftate of Kirkurd was the refident 
property of Geddes of Rachan for 1 100 years, while Rachan, 
from whence the title was taken, is reported to have been in 
the poffeflion of the Geddes's for 1300 years. James Ged- 
des of Rachan was born in this parifh in 1710, was educated 
for, and praclifed feveral years at, the bar, but died of a con- 
sumption before he arrived at the age of 40. He publifhed 
an Effay on the Compofition and Manner of Writing of the 
Ancients, and left behind him feveral other tracts *.

* In the parks of Kirkurd are two fmall mounts, called the 
Caftte and Law. They are furrounded with a dike of an irre- 
gular form. Mr Gordon, in his Itinerary, thinks them artifi- 
cial, but does not form any conjecture as to their ufe. There is 
to the eaft of thefe, a circular fortification on an eminence near 
Ladyurd, called the Rings, and another to the weft, on the farm 
of Lochurd, called the Chefters ; hence they are fuppofed to 
have been a military erection  and a place called Gamprigend a 
mile fouth to the laft of thefe, farther confirms this idea/'

Among the advantages formerly mentioned which this 
parifh enjoys, may be added its vicinity to lime ; but, not- 
withftanding of the acknowledged advantages arifing from 
lime to land, the farmers hero have not generally (as yet) 
availed themfelves of it. One difadvantage which this place 
labours under, (and which was fpecified above), is the ex- 
action of fervices j but there is another grievance under 
which the farmers groan, and which calls loudly for redrefs, 
and that is the payment of multure. The tenants are thirled 
to the mills, and pay a high multure, which is a great bar to 
improvement. By thirlage a forced employment is given to 
mills, for which there would be no demand, if things were 
left to their natural courfe. Though the generality of the 
country around is fitter for fheep pafture than tillage, yet no 
lefs than four corn-mills are found on the Water of Tarth, 
all in the fpace of about a mile and a half, two of which are 
fituated within this parifh. 

NUM. 

More than 30 years ago, there was found in the Mount-hill 
a clay urn full of bones, which was furrounded with four broad 
ftones, and covered with a Clone on the top. There was lately 
found at the bottom of the fame hill, a Hone coffin, about 4! 
feet long, 2| feet wide, and zi feet deep. Its bottom was gra- 
vel, the fules built of feveral ftones, and the cover one entire 
ftone. The bony Was not lying at full length, as, by the fize of 
the bones, it appeared to have been about 6 feet long. The 
bones appeared entire when firft drfcovered ; but, upon being 
expnfed to the air, and lifted up by the hand, thev crumbled 
to duft. There was found among the bones three flint ftones, 
one refembiing a hJbert, another of a circular form, and the 
third cylindrical. The firft is fuppofed to be the antient wea- 
pon called the ftone cdt, the other were two kinds of warlike 
inftruments. There was alfo difcovered a fmall ring, This is 
a Druidical amulet ; and it was an indication that a perfon of 
rank wa? here interred. 

Hairjianes, fo named, perhaps, from a few ereft ftones arran- 
ged circularly, is faid to have been a place for religious wor- 
ftip. In the immediate neighbourhood is the Kiikdean and 
Temple lands.

<p>Extent, Name, &amp;c. 

v 

T7 , EW parifhes in Scotland afford lefs fubjecT: for ftatiftical 
JL inquiries than this of Botriphnie. It is fituated about 
24 Englifh miles W. from the county town, and extends 
from N. to S. about 4^, and from E. to W. about 3 Englifh 
miles, comprehending the whole breadth of the county, be- 
ing bounded by the parifh of Giafs, in Aberdeenfhire, on the 
S. nnd on the N. by part of Dundurcas, in Moray. 

The name of the parifh, like moft others in this part of 
Scotland, is probably of Gaelic origin ; but, though the pre- 
fent incumbent has converfed with many perlons who under- 
ftood that language, he could obtain no information with rc- 
fpedf to its derivation. The greater part of the parifh ton- 
lifts of one beautiful ftrath, fituated between two hills to the 
N. and S with the fmall river of Ifla (which takts us rife 
in the W. part of the parifh towards Mortlach j running 
through the middle of it. The banks of this lin-am are 
beautifully adorned with aller and birch trees, th. natural 
produce of the country j feveral fmall rills, which tall into it 
from the hills on cr.ch fide, are covered in the fame manner \

and the proprietor has made very extenfive plantations of fir 
and other trees, all which add greatly to the beauty of the 
country. The fir trees towards the top of the hills are gene- 
rally dwarlilh ; but they increale in fize towards the bottom, 
and are generally found to thrive better in a northerly than 
in a foutherly expofure. 

Soil, Agriculture, tsV.~The foil is a black loam, and, in 
fome places, a (trong clay, and not many feet from the fur- 
face. Limeftone, of an excellent quality, is to be met with 
in every field ; but it is little uied, except for the purpofes 
of building. Many farmers in this parifh have tried it with- 
out fuccefs ; and, though they do not pretend to fay that it 
hurts their fields, yet they do not find the returns from it 
equal to the expence. A gentleman, who rents a very ex- 
tenfive farm, has lately ufed lime in very confiderable quan- 
tities ; but it will require a little time fully to afcertain its 
effects. On ground lately taken in from the heath, its in- 
fluence is more perceptible. 

The fields on the N. fide of the parifh have a good expo- 
iure, and are of confiderable extent, from the river to the 
top of the hill ; and, for the whole length of the parifh on 
that fide, there is hardly a break in them, except where they 
are interfered by a few fmall rills, and clumps of birch and 
aller. About every farm there are a confiderable number of 
afh trees, which are equally fubfervient to utility and orna- 
ment. 

Except in two farms, there are no inclofures in the parifh. 
The I tones for that purpofe might be quarried at no great 
expence. In general, the ridges are flraight ; but few other 
improvements in hufbandry are to be met with. No country 
an! w._ j -.\s better for fown grafs ; and as rich fields of it are to 
be met with here as in any part of Scotland ; but they are 

confined 



of Botriphnie. 139 

confined to two or three farms, and ferve only to fliow what 
the country might produce, were it in the hands of perfons 
who had abilities or encouragement to improve. 

Rent, Services, Is'c— The rent of the parifh is upwards of 
icool. Sterling, divided into farms of different extent, from. 
70 1. to 81. a year, partly paid in money, and partly in oat- 
meal. It may be proper to mention, among other caufes 
that retard improvement, that leafes are only granted for 19 
years, and fome for a fhorter period ; that befides the rent, 
as above fyecified, feveral lervices are exacted of the tenants, 
fuch as leading fuel, cutting down corn in harveft, and other 
exactions of a fimilar nature, which, if viewed in a proper 
light, are more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial to the 
proprietor. 

Thefe remains of feudal vafialage are mentioned with re- 
luctance ; and it is to be hoped, that the good fenfe of the 
proprietors will lead them to vie with one another in remo- 
ving every reftraint on induflry, and confider it as their ho- 
nour, as it is certainly their intereft, to fee their tenants 
thriving and independent. For this purpofe, befides an al- 
lowance to build comfortable houfes, make fubftantial inclo- 
fures, and plant trees and hedges, no leafe fhould be for a 
fhorter period than two 19 years and a life ; and thirlage, 
and every other fervice, fhould be aboliihed. 

Flax anfwers well in this parifh, and confiderable quanti- 
ties of it are raifed annually. Barley and oats are the prin- 
cipal produce of the country. The late harvefts, for fome 
years paft, have difcouraged the growth of peafe ; but, in 
ordinary years, they are very productive, both in point of 
corn and provender for cattle, and as an excellent prepara- 
tion for a crop of barley. 

The 



19° 



Statijlical Account 



The rent of land, when let out in fmall parcels, is 20 s. 
the Scotch acre ; and, in larger farms, about 1 5 s. Land of 
an inferior quality lets from 6 s. to 10 s. Barley harveft be- 
gins generally about the middle of September, though oats 
are commonly three weeks later. An earlier fpecieb or oats 
has of late been introduced, which fuccteds well on ground 
in good heart, and is as foon ready as barley. 

In 1782, there was a great deficiency in the crop, owing 
to the froft coming on early, and preventing the grain from 
coming to maturity. Had it not be n tor a very conlider- 
able importation, the conferences mult have been fatal. 
The deficiency of the fucceeding crop arofe entirely from 
the badnefs of the feed. Even oats that appeared little infe- 
rior in plumpuefs and colour to the produce of ordinary 
years, proved equally unfit for feed as the pooreit grain. 
They looked well on their firft coming above ground, but 
foon after totally diiappeared *. 

Maniifaflures^ &amp;c. — In this parifh there are 9 weavers, 3 
turners, clvefly employed in making fpinning wheels, 1 car- 
penter. 4 taylors, 4 ihoemakers, 2 fhopkeepers, and 12 ma- 
fons. The latter are not much employed within the parifh; 
but they find work in the fouthern counties, and refide here 
in the winter. 

The women are employed in fpinning linen yarn, from 
flax partly of their own rearing, and partly imported from 
Holland by the manufacturers. The latter kind is fpun 
from 6 to 8 hanks in the pound, and varies in the price of 
fpinning according to the demand. Flax of home growth is 
fpun from 2 to 5 hanks in the pound, and is fold at an an- 
nual 

* The price of labour has increafed much within 7 years. 
Men fervants wages are from 6 '. to 7 1. and women-fervants 
about 50 s. a year. A day-labourer earns 6d. beftdes victuals.

nual fair held here in February, and bought up by manufac- 
turers in the villages of Keith and Huntly, who fend it to 
Glafgow and Paifley. At prefent, it fells at 2 s. 6d. the 
fpindle, or 4 hanks, which is 4d. dearer than it was laft 
fealbn. 

A confiderable quantity of linen cloth is likewife made 
from flax reared in the parifh, which, after it is bleached, is 
fold at an annual fair held in Keith in September, and at 
Huntly in July. 

Produce. — A great deal of money is annually received for 
black cattle, which have now become an object of as much 
importance to the farmer as corn itfelf. 

Much more grain is raifed in the parifh than is fufficient 
for the maintainance of the inhabitants. The meal paid to 
the proprietors finds a market in the (outturn counties. The 
barley raifed by the tenants is confumed by the licenfed dis- 
tillers. The countries of Badenoch, Strathfpey, and Strath- 
aven, generally have a demand for what meal can be fpared ; 
and the farmer often finds his account in felling oats, which 
are fhipped at Garmouth or Buckie for the Frith of Forth. 

Very few fheep are reared in the parilh, and thefe of a 
very fmall fize ; and very little woollen cloth is made, ex- 
cept for home confumption. 

Population. — The population of this parifh has decreafed 
about 80 fince 1774 ; at that period the numbers were 700, 
and they are now 620, of all ages. The return to Dr Web- 
fter in 1755 was 953 fouls. This decreafe is owing to the 
enlargement of Come farms, and to the number of lubtenants 
being leffened, the farmer generally finding his account more 
in occupying the ground himfelf, than in letting it at a fmall 
advanced rent to others. The advance of wages, too, has 

made 



192 



Statiftical Account 



made the farmer contrive to labour with fewer fervants. For 
io years preceding 1793, there were 66 males and 64 fe- 
males baptifed, and 41 couples married. 

Eccleftajlical State, t3"c. — The church was built in 1617, 
and is at prefent in a very ruinous condition. There is no 
redding heritor, and the principal one is a minor, which will 
account for the circumftance now mentioned. The Earl of 
Fife is patron. The ftipend fixed by decreet in 1776 is 
47 I. 5 s. Sterling, (including 50 merles Scotch for commu- 
nion elements), and 54 bolls of oat-meal. The glebe mea- 
fures 6 acres, including 2 acres of meadow grafs. The manfe 
was built in 1776. There are few diffenters of any defcrip- 
tion in the parilh ; 1 Roman Catholic, 1 Epifcopal, and 1 5 
Seceders *. 

There is a parochial fchoolmafier, whofe falary is 12 bolls 
of meal, and 2 1. Sterling for adYing as feffion clerk. The 
boys are taught reading, writing, and accounts. It was much 
the fafhion formerly to inftrucl them in Latin, and fend them 
to the Univerfity ; but, whatever advantage this might be to 
the individual, it was a lofs to the fociety, who was thereby 
drained of ufeful hands, that are now more profitably em- 
ployed in agriculture and manufactures. 

The funds for the fupport of the poor are, the weekly col- 
lections, the intereft of 70 1. and the rent of a loft in the 

church,

His immediate predeceffbr, Mr Campbell, was fettled in 1 727,

an Epifcopal, and fettled in 1682; and it is mentioned as a 
mark of the refpectability of his character, and the moderation

church, which, at an average, will amount to iol. yearly, 
by which 10 perfons receive occafional fupplies *. 

MifiellaneoUS Obfervatlons. — The people are fober, induflri- 
ous, and of" good morals, and well affected to our preient 
conftitution. 

There are no difcafes peculiar to this country. The prac- 
tice of inoculation is not yet introduced among them. In 
the courfe of 19 years, 8 children have died of the fmall- 
pox. No extraordinary inftances of longevity have occurred 
here. Two perfons died fome years ago at the age of 90 ; 
and there are 4 now living upwards of 80. 

The neighbouring hills fupply the inhabitants with peat 
and turf ; but much of their time in fummer is confumed in 
preparing and leading them home. If the tax on coals be 
taken off, it will probably encourage the farmers to fupply 
themfelves with that article, and thereby they will have more 
time to devote to hufbandry. The roads are more attended 
'to, and kept in better repair, by the ftatute labour, in this 
than in any of the nei 0 hbouring parifhes. 

N U M, 

* The price of every neceflary of life has advanced very confi- 
derably fince 1783; fome of them have nearly doubled in value. 
Eggs, formerly 1 d. per dozen, are now 2 d. ; hens 8 d. former- 
ly 5 d. ; butter 7 d. formerly c d. per lib. of 24 Englilh ounces; 
cheefe 53. per Hone; beef, mutton, and pork, from 4s. to 5s. 
per (lone. But the price of no article ia fo much felt, and lb 
loudly complained of, as fait and leather, the taxes on winch 
fall heavily on the middling and lower clalTes of people. 

The clergy whofe livings are fixed, fuller particularly by the 
advanced pi ice of almolt every article neceflary in a fam iy ; 
but, if our Judge? continue to grant augmentations to minilters 
on the fame liberal principles they have done of late, it will in 
fome degree remedy this inconveniency, and is the* only circum- 
ftance that can enable them to maintain that refpeft in lbciety 
which they have hitherto done.

<p>Situation^ Extent, ^fc. 

fTPI H E names of thefe united parifhes are probably of 
Danifh or Norwegian extraction, but the meaning 
cannot now be afcertained *. The ifland of Breflay is about 
4 miles long, and 2 broad ; it lies to the eaftward of the 
main land of Zetland, being fcparated from it by Breflay 
Sound. This Sound forms one of the beft harbours in the 
world. Here the DutcJi herring fleet rendezvous about the 
middle of June ; and here are iometimes to be feen a num- 
ber of large vefTels, with valuable cargoes. Adjoining to Bref- 
fay, and on the S. E. fide of it, lies the fmall ifland of Nofs, 
one of the fineft and molt fertile in Shetland. Qjarff lies 6 
miles S. W. from thefe iflands, and is part of the main land. 
It is a valley, about two Engli/h miles long, and one broad ; 
bounded on the E. by the fea, and part of the parilh of Ler- 
wick ; on the W. by Cliff Sound, which divides it from the 
ifles of Barra and Trondra , on the S. by Conifburgh ; and 

on 

* Only the termination a or ay, very common in Zetland 
and Orkney, denotes " furrounded by the fea."

on the N. by the parifh of Tingwall. The iflands of Burra 
and Houfe are fituated on the W. fide of the main land, and 
ieparated from it by a narrow found. They lie fo near to 
one another, that there is a communication between them by 
a bridge. They are about 4 miles long, and nearly 1 broad. 
Havera, another fmall ifland belonging to this parifh, is fitu- 
ated about half a mile to the fouthward of Burra and Papa, 
on the N. W. Breffay contains 366 merks of land, Quarff 
93, Burra and Havera 241, in all 700 merks, befides cutlets, 
which are not in the rentals. The pafture grounds are ex- 
tenfive, and feed great numbers of fheep, cows, oxen, and 
horfes. In lome places there are large meadows, which, in 
favourable feafons, produce tolerable crops of hay. The hills 
afford excellent peats in great plenty. The whole rent is 
about 4000 l Scotch. But the value of eltates in this coun- 
try is not to be eftimated from the rents payable to the land- 
lords. The fifhing which their tenants are obliged to carry 
on for them, more than doubles it. Services are alio demand- 
ed, which are lometimes commuted for money. 

Climate, EsV — The climate in this country is rather damp, 
but not unfavourable to health. There are no epidemical 
difeafes here. Laft fummer, a flow fever, which has been 
brought in by a foreign fhip, prevailed in BiefT-ty, and has 
now got into Burra and Quarff. It is very infectious. The 
people could not procure proper nourishment to fupport 
them under it, and a confiderable number died. Rheuma- 
tifms are very common, owing partly to the dampnefs of the 
air, and partly to the alternate heats and colds, to which the 
people are neceffarily fubjecled in the profecution of their 
bufinefs. Inoculation for the fmalLpox has been of late fuc- 
cefsfully ufed in thefe parifhes. About two years ago, a 
young gentleman inoculated 132 in the ifles of Burra and

Iloufe, Tome of whom were 40 years of age, and not one 
died. The people, though ltrongly attached to their old 
cuftoms, fubmit to this operation wilh a degree of readinefs. 
which does them credit. The fcurvy does not prevail fo 
much here as in fome of the other parilhes of this country. 
Convullion fits are unknown. 

The coafts of thefe pariftus are, for the moft part, bold 
and rocky. We have no rivers. There are a few lakes 
and rivulets, in which excellent trout are fometimes caught. 
In BrefTiy there are 26 large fifhing boats, in Quarft* 5. 
They are fitted out at a coniiderable expence ; and the ave- 
rage number of ling in a feafon for each boat may be about 
300. There are, betides, a number of {mall boats. In Bur- 
ra, Havera, and Papa, they have 28 boats of a lefler fize, and 
fitted out at little expence. In winter they fifh for fillocks, 
fmall cod, haddocks, Sec. A few tons of kelp are annually 
made from the fea ware. 

Agnculture, — In the whole of thefe parifhes there are not 
above 6 ploughs, and thefe of a very particular form, a de- 
fcription of which is given by the Reverend Mr Morrifbn of 
Deliing. The farms are now fo fmall, that the people can. 
not afford to keep ploughs. Befides, many of them arc of 
opinion, that ground turned up with the fpade produces 
richer crops than that which is ploughed. The foil of the 
cultivated parts of ErefLy is a fine clay. One mode of im- 
provement has been adopted by fome of the people of this 
ifland, which, on account of its Angularity, deferves to be 
mentioned. In the vicinity of the hills, where the mofs is 
only one peat deep, they firft take off the grafs fods, lay them 
carefully afiJe, then dig up the peats ; after which they Jay 
the fods upon a fine clay bottom, prefs thqm down with their 
' feet, and afterwards have good crops of grafs and corn upon 

them.

them. Others, whofe grounds are wet, have dug deep 
trenches, to dry and to divide their fields ; and, by throwing 
the earth upon the ridges, greatly meliorate the foil, and 
raife 2 or 3 good crops without any manure. The foil of 
Quarff is llkewife day, and, in ordinary feafons, produces 
tolerable crops, though rather late, on account of the wetnefs' 
of the ground. The foil of Burra is of different kinds. In 
fome places it is fandy, in others a fine black earth. In good 
years, it produces grain fuificient for the'confumpt of the in- 
habitants. The people here manage their hay crop in a very 
abliird manner. They never cut it but when wet j they al- 
low it to lie 2 or 3 weeks, even in the fined weather, and 
will not touch it, however dry, till it gets fome fhowers, and 
is bleached by the rains. By this time the fubftance is gone. 
So obftimte are their prejudices on this head, that it is im- 
pofiible to convince them of their error. The filhing is a 
great obflacle to improvements in agriculture, the chief ob- 
ject of the proprietors being to have as many filhermen upon 
their grounds as poifible. The farms, confequently, are very 
i'mall. Few leafes are granted. Many fervices, the fad 
marks of llavery, are demanded. They mud fi ih for their 
rnafters, who either giVe them a fee entirely inadequate to 
their labour and their dangers, or take their fiflr at a low- 
er price than others would give. It is true, that, in years of 
fcarcity, they muft depend upon their landlords for the means 
of fubfifience, and are often deep in their debt. But why 
not allow them to make the beft of their fituation ? Why 
not let them have leafes upon reafonable terms, and difpofe 
of their produce to thofe who will give them the beft price ? 
Why not let them filh for themfelves ? Why fhould the 
laird have any claim except for the ftipulated rent ? Neither 
the climate nor the foil are favourable to improvements in 

agriculture ;

agriculture j but, with proper encouragement, much might 
be done. 

Sheep, &amp;c. — There are about 5000 fheep and 500 milch 
cows, befides oxen and young cattle, in thefe united parifhes. 
The number of horfes is great. They are fmall, but very 
hardy. Many of the fheep are of the bcft quality, and pro- 
duce fine wool, which is made into ftockings, fome of which 
fell at a high price, and are reckoned the beft of their kind 
by the merchants of Lerwick. The returns, however, to the 
maker are very fmall. By manufacturing this wool into 
cloth, the people would gain much more Few of them 
feetn to be acquainted with the proper method of making 
butter. Cueefe is never made here. The time of preparing 
the ground, and towing, is commonly from the middle of 
March to the ift of May^ The harveft is for the moft part 
over by the end of September.

According 



of Brejfay, Burra, and £uarff. 199 

According to the regifters of Ereflay, there were 110 
males and 116 females baprifeJ, and 63 couples married, in 
10 years preceding 1792. The regifters of Burra and Quarff 
are in fuch diforder, that no extract of marriages and bap- 
tifms, to be depended upon, can be given from them. 

The return to Dr Weblter in 1755 was I0 9^ ^ ou ' s - 

From the beft information which could be obtained on this 
fubject, it appears, that, within thefe 20 years, the numbeF 
of inhabitants in Breffay and Quarff has increafed at lead 
200. Burra has long continued Stationary in this refpect. 
In moll countries, the increafe of population is reckoned an 
advantage, and juftly. It is, however, the reverfe in the pre- 
fent ftate of Shetland. The farms are fplit. The young 
are encouraged to marry, without having any ftock. The 
confequence is poverty and diftrefs. Were manufactures 
eftablifhed here, to employ the people, and enable them to 
procure a comfortable fubfiftence, their increafed numbers 
would be pleating to every patriotic mindj but, it is believed, 
that there is at prefent, in thefe iflands, double the number 
of people they can properly maintain. 

There are about 79 fcrvants, of both fexes, in thefe pa- 
rifhes, the greateft part of which are employed in country 
affairs. There are 1 1 taylors, 2 imiths, 4 fhoemakers, 2 
carpenters, 1 joiner, 1 wheelwright The people here dis- 
cover great ingenuity in the different handicraft employments. 
Molt of them are felf-taught, and can work at different trades. 
Neceffity has made them exert themfelves. 

Eccleftqftical State, &amp;c— The ftipend is paid in butter and 
oil, with fome money for boat-teind, and may be worth 65 f. 
It has not been augmented. The glebe is large. The manfe 
was built in. 1782, and laft fummer was completely repaired 
at a very confiderablc "expence. There are 2 churches 10

Englifh miles diftant from one another. The one is in Bref- 
fay, very near the manfe ; the other is in Eurra. Neither of 
them is in good order. The kirk of Burra is very antient, 
and has a large fteeple ; it feems to have been a Popifh cha- 
pel. The heritors are 9 in number ; but the greateft part of 
thefe have very fmall property in the miniftry. Sir Thomas 
Dundas is patron. The prefent incumbent is Mr John 
Menzies, a bachelor, who was fettled in May 1792. There 
is an eftablifhed fchool in thele parifhes; and application has 
been made to the Society for propagating Chriftian Know- 
ledge for a charity fchool to Burra and Qiiarff, which has 
been granted, though not yet erected. It is much to be la- 
mented, that the education of youth is not more attended to 
in this country. The people difcover a quicknefs of appre- 
henfion, and an aptnefs to learn, which deferve to be en- 
couraged. Many of the young men go abroad, and fuch of 
them as have got a decent education, rife to preferment. 
The poor of Breffay have funds diftinft from thofe of Burra 
and Quarff. Thele are managed by the different feffions. 
To the former belong the intereft: of 150 1. Scots, and the 
rent of 4 merks land, mortified by Mr William Humphry, 
formerly minifter of thefe parifhes. The latter have the in- 
tereft of 20 1. Sterling, and the rents of 8 merks land, morti- 
fied by the fame gentleman. Thefe, with the collections, 
which are very fmall, afford them a fcanty allowance *. -

Miftellaneous Obfcrvatiotis. — The people are very hofpitable 
.■and obliging ; they are regular in their attendance upon the 
ordinances of religion. None of them have for many years 
beta charged with, any crime, which could lay them open 
to the cognizance of the laws of their country, one woman 
belonging to tire-flay excepted, who, about 3 years ago, was 
convicted of coining and uttering Danilh money, imprifon- 
«d and fet on the pillory. They are not much difpofed to 
induftry ; but the reaion is obvious ; they have no object to 
call forth their exertion?. Convince them that it is their in- 
tereft to labour, and they will approve themfelves good and 
faithful workmen. They are immoderately fond of tea and 
fnuff. For the fake of thefe fuperflnities, they will deny 
themfelves many of the neceflaries of life. They are rather 
expenfive for their circumftances, particularly in the manage- 
ment of their marriages and funerals ; and by thefe means 
they often contract debts which they can never difcharge. 

Thefe united parifhes enjoy very confiderable advantages. 
Almoft all the inhabitants of Lerwick are fupplied with peats 
from the hills of BrefTay, and almoft the whole people of 
Shetland with flates from its excellent quarries. They have 
a good market for every article of proviiion. The fifhing on 
the coaft of Burra is carried on at a final! expence. The 
tffhermen fet their lines in the evening, and draw them in the 
morning. Their winter fifhings have been fometimes known

We have great numbers of plovers, fnipes, linnets, darlings, 
and crows, but no muirfowi, hares, or partridges. Tnere are 
many rabbits in the iflands of Nofs and Burra. The migratory 
birds are the chalder, which refembles a lapwing; tfcej appear 
in March, and diiappear in September. Ktttywcaks come nere 
in great numbers in the ipnng, hatch their young in the cJihs 
ot the rocks, and go away, as it is iuppoied, to the coatt of 
Jutland in autumn. "We have alio lea-parrots and cormorants

to exceed their fummer's. They have upon their coaft a fine 
oyfter fcalp, from which they take large rich oyftcrs. Hence 
they are, in general, in eafy circumftances. Nor have the 
rents of their lands been raifed for forne centuries. The 
people of Quarff are frequently employed in tranfporting 
goods from the one fide of the country to the other, which 
brings them in confidcrable fums. 

To better the circumftances of the people, it is neceflary 
to give them larger farms, long leafes, and liberty to difpoie 
of their produce to the beft advantage. To employ thofe 
who have no farms, and are in a great meafure idle, manu- 
factories of woollen cloth and fifhing-lines fhould be efh- 
blifhed. They fhould be taught to turn their raw hides to 
account, by tanning therh. The women fhould learn to fpin 
flax, by which they might probably earn 5 d. or 6 d. a day, 
inftead of id. or \\d. which they now earn by knitting 
ftockings. A linen manufactory might afterwards be erected 
with great advantage *.

* There are feveral ruins of Pictifh caflles in this miniftry, 
but too inconfiderable to merit a defcription here. There are 
alfo leveral perpendicular flones, about 9 feet high, erected, no 
doubt, for the purpofe of commemorating fome great event, 
but of which we have no account. One of them, however, in 
the iflrind of Breffay, makes an excellent land-mark to fhips 
coming into BrelTay Sound. Near the ifland of Nofs, there is a 
rock or holm, perpendicular on all fides, and about 150 feet 
high. The oppofite rock on the ifland is nearly of equal height, 
and dillant from the other about 240 feet. This holm, which 
is quite level on the top, produces excellent grafs, which 
maintains Iheep during the ftimmer feafon. Although it ap- 
peared inacceflible on all lidts, the apparent richnefs of the 
grafs, or, as fome fay, the valt quantities of fea-fowl which 
breed on it, induced the proprietor, many years ago, to endea- 
vour to fall upon fome means of paffing between the ifland and 
it. Accordingly, a daring iflander attempted to climb up, and 
fucceeded. He fixed polls in the ground, about two feet and a 
hajf from each other, correfponding polls being fixed on the 

oppofite 



of B re fay, Burr a, and Quarff. 203 

Few years pafs in which fhips are not caft away upon thefe 
dangerous coafts. Sailors unacquainted with the coaft, efpe- 
cially in thick weather, and in dark nights, are ready to 
miftake the opening between the iflan'ds of BrefTay and Nofs 
for the entrance to BrefTay Sound , and, if they come too 
near the rocks, are in danger of being dallied to pieces. A 
light upon Nofs Head, which would be feen at a great dis- 
tance, might prevent fuch difafters. It could be erected at 
no great expence. This matter certainly deferves the atten- 
tion of Government. 

The people here are all Preibyterians of the eftabliflied 
Church of Scotland. Their language is the fame with that 
of the inhabitants of North Britain. The names of places 
are derived from the Danifh and Norwegian languages, and 
are faid to be very exprefllve of the fituation.

the other, upon which a wooden cradle Aides along, and af- 
fords a fafe conveyance between the ifland and the holm. The 
man who firft afcended the rock, would not take the benefit of 
returning in the cradle, but, attempting to return the fame 
way he went up, fell, and was unfortunately killed. The re- 
ward which he was to have received from the laird, had he 
come back fafe, was a horfe, cow, fheep, &amp;c. Sheep are now 
annually put into the holm in the beginning of the feafon, and

PARISH OF <name>LESSUDDEN</name> OR <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1002153">St BOSWELLS</name>. 

(Prefbytery of Selkirk. — Synod of Merfe and TtvioU 
dale. — County of Roxburgh J 

By the Reverend Mr John Scade.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

A considerable village in this parifh goes by the name 
Jt\ of I.eJJudden, which it is fuppofed to have got from it i 
havirfg been once the refidence of one Aidan, Bifhop of Lin- 
disfarne. Lis beirg a Scoto-Celtic word, fignifying refidence, 
Lis- Aidan, the refidence of Aidan, by a carelefs pronuncia- 
tion, n light in time become what it now is, LeJJudden. Aidan 
was educated in the monaftery of Icolmkill, and is mentioned 
in terms of refpeel by Bede, in his ecclefiaftical hiftory *. 
St Boifil was a difciple of St Cuthbert, and for fbme time be- 
longed to the monaftery of Old Melrofe, in the neighbour- 
hood of this place. 

Extent, ProduBions, &amp;c. — This parifh, which is fituated on 
the banks of the Tweed, within 10 miles of Kelfo, 5 of Mel- 
rofe, 

* Such as are difpofed to inquire farther into the life of 
Bjfhop Aidan, may confult Dr Mackenzie's lives of the Scotch 
writers, vol. 1. p. 359 Bede, Hay's ReliqUae Sacrae, and 
Spottifwood's Church Hiftory. But the more general name of 
the parifh, and the proper name of the church, is St Bo/wef/f, 
from St Boifil a French monk, who is faid to have founded it 
about the beginning of the feventh century.

rofe, and 7 of Jedburgh, is from E. to W. about 3 miles 
long. Towards the E. it is narrow, but becomes broader to 
the we ft ward ; and, at the broadeft, may be about a mile and 
a half, or near 2 miles wide. The loil, in general, is good ; 
that which lies on the banks of the Tweed, and in fundry 
other places of the parifh, is fine; and even the grounds 
which are the worft, are capable of great improvement, by 
the ufe of lime or marl. Of late, much has been done, and 
the fpirit of cultivation continues to operate. The expence 
of improving with lime is- great, as the lime mull come either 
from the Lothian kilns, or thofe on the border of England. 
Each cart-load, drawn by 2 horfes, and confifting of 12 fir- 
lots, cofls from 1 o s. to 12 s. Six, eight, or nine of thefe 
cart-loads, according to the nature of the ground, are em- 
ployed upon an acre ; but this expence is many times repaid 
with interelf, from the melioration of the land. Fine wheat 
has been raifed on fome pieces of land in this parifh, which, 
lefs than 40 years ago, were thought incapable of producing 
fuch a valuable article. Wheat is raifed in due proportion to 
the extent of the farms every where in the parifh, which, in 
many places, yields to none in Teviotdale in point of quality. 
In the whole, from 450 to 500 bolls are raifed annually. 
Barley is cultivated in proportional plenty, and with fuccefs ; 
and the fame may be laid of oats and peafe. On the lands 
near Tweedfide, the cold feed peafe are commonly fown, 
and as commonly productive of fine: crops. In fundry places, 
turnips either are or may be fown with advantage ; they are 
found to grow to a good fize. The whole lands are remark- 1 
ably well adapted for yielding fine crops of grafs. 

The principal market for the wheat raifed here is Dalkeith. 
Peebles fnmifhes a demand for a good deal. A confiderable 
quantity of the barky is difpoled of at Melrofe, fome at Dal- 
keith and elfewhere, befide what is ground with peafe into 

bread-

Stati/iical Account 



bread-meal, and fold both at home and in other places ad- 
jacent. The peafe are in requeft, and find various purcha- 
fers ; and, with refpect to the oats, the manufacture of them 
into meal, and the conveyance of it to the Lothian markets, 
is an article of trade. 

Rent, CSV. — As in other places, fo here, land has rifen, 
and is upon the rife. The valued rent is 4330 1. 18s. 2d. 
Scotch. The real rent it is not fo eafy to afcertain exactly, 
as feveral cultivate their own lands, but it is probably from 
1600I. to 1800I. Sterling. 

St Bofweirs Fair. — St Bofwell's fair is held on a large 
green of the fame name, through which pafles the turnpike 
road from the Lothians to Jedburgh, &amp;c. It holds in the 
name of his Grace the Duke of Buccleugh, and is faid to be 
the greateft in the fouth of Scotland. It is held annually on 
the 1 8th of July, or on the Monday following, if the 18th fall 
on Sunday ; but its happening either on the Monday or Sa- 
turday, is very juftly thought to occafion much inattention to 
the religious obfervance of the Sabbath. The evil has been 
complained of, but no remedy has yet been applied. If the 
day be fine, the concourfe of people is immenfe; and, who- 
ever it be, bufinefs brings a great multitude, of which fome 
come from a very confiderable diftance. Sheep are a prin- 
cipal article of commerce. Great flocks of fheep of all de- 
nominations are brought from all parts of the adjacent coun- 
try, and generally find fo ready a market, as to be difpofed 
of early in the morning, at lateft in the forenoon. Black 
cattle are alfo numerous ; and the fhow of horfes has ufually 
been fo fine, that buyers come from many places both of 
England and Scotland. Linen cloth is another article. Great 
numbers of people throughout the neighbouring country em- 
ploy 



of Lefudden or St Bofwclls. 207 

ploy themfelves during winter in fpinning ; they endeavour to 
qet their webs ready againft the fair, where they are pretty 
fure of a market, though not always of a fufficient recoinpencc 
for their expences and labour ; neverthelefs, upon the whole, 
tbey get fuch prices as encourage them to be induftrious in 
the. fume line. The prices, according to the quality of the 
cloth, are from 10 d. and is. to 3 s. 6 d. 4 s. and 4 s. 6d. 
per yard. Some provide themfelves in linen at this fair, al- 
ledging that they can furnifh themfelves cheaper and better 
at it, than they could do by manufacturing at home. This 
may poflibly be true ; for, in genteel families, the expence of 
maintaining the workers will be higher than the fpinfter in a 
cottage, while the Ikill and care beftowed on the work arc 
equal. Booths, (or, as they are here called, craims), contain- 
ing hardware and haberdalhery goods, are erected in great 
numbers at the fare, and (lored with fuch articles as fuit the 
generality. The money turned in the courle of the day at 
this fair is guefftd to be from 8000 I. to 1 0,000 1. Sterling. 
The Duke of Buccleugh receives a certain rate or toll upon 
fheep, cattle, and all other commodities brought inter the fair 
for fale. Old fheep pay 1 merk Scotch per fcore, lambs one 
half of that fum, and fo on. This toll is fometimes collected 
by people appointed for the purpofe; but it is more common- 
ly let to fome individual for fuch a fum of money as can be 
agreed on. The higheft at which it ever was let was 53 I. 
the loweft 33 1. and the average is fuppofed to be about 38 1. 

Ecclcfiaftical State. — The church, between 3 and 4 years 
ago, was ruinous, unpleafant, extremely cold, and injurious 
to health •, but, by a thorough repair, has been made one of 
the beft in the country. The expence incurred was 100 1. 
Sterling. The manfe and offices are quite new, having been 
fmifhed in fummer 1791. The church and manfe are in a 

pleafant 



2 0 3 Statiftical Account 

pleafant fituation on the banks of the Tweed ; but the church, 
is not in the moft centrical fituation for the conveniency of 
the parifh. The ftipend contorts of 54 bolls of oats, 26 bolls 
of bear or barley, both of the ineafure of Dryburgh Abbey, 
and 24 I. 6 s. in money. The common meafurc -of this 
country is the Teviotdale boll, which contains 15 pecks ; 
but the Abbey boll contains oniy 14, which reduces the vic- 
tual in the ftipend to 50 bolls of oats, and 24 of barley, Te- 
viotdale meafure. The money ftipend, 24 1. 6 s. ariies chiefly 
out of a converhon, by which the incumbent is a great lofer. 
The glebe confifts of about 4 Scotch acres, and the land ex- 
ceedingly good. In addition to this, the incumbent has fome 
banks, in name of a grafs glebe ; bat the greatell part of 
them being dangerous for either horfe or cow to feed on, no 
material advantage is derived from them. A procefs to pro- 
cure fome fmall addition to the living is in contemplation *. 

, School. — There is an eftablifhed fchoolmafter in Leffudden, 
where he has a good comfortable houfe, and teaches reading 
of Englifh, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, menfuration, 
&amp;c. with the principles and the books ufed by beginners in 
the Latin tongue. BeliJe the fchool wages, he has a legal 
falary of 100 m^rks Scotch -, but, upon his application, the 
heritors, at a flSeeting lately held, unanimoufly agreed to aug- 
ment his Mary, to 100 1. Scotch; which addition to his li- 
ving, they have given him ground to believe, will be conti- 
nued 

* In the bank of the grafs glebe next the Tweed, there are 
fandry fptmgsof water, one of which is reported to be of a 
chalybeate quality ; bur no experiments which are now remem- 
bered, have been. made to afcertain its properties. It has, how- 
ever been long, aud foil is, ufed in fcorbtit.c cafes, fome lay 
with great iuccefs ; and it is in the recolleflion ot many that

had done. The fchoolmafier is feflion-clerk, clerk to the 
heritors in their meetings, and collector or fuch funis as they 
have occafion to afi'efs themfelves in, for each of which of- 
fices he has a certain allowance. Fifty fcholars, at an ave- 
rage, attend the fchool through the: year *. 

Population There is no reafon to believe that this parifh 

ever was very populous ; perhaps its prefent inhabitants are 
as numerous as at any period of which we are well informed. 
The village of LefTudden, indeed, was once more populous 
than it is now ; but then, in feveral other parts of the parifh, 
there was fcarce any population at all. The return to Dr 
Webfter in 1755 was 309 fouls. The whole number at pre- 
fent, inclufive of children, amount to about 500. Of thefe, 
about 300 refide in LefTudden, and about 200 in the other 
parts of the parifh. The people, in general, are of a fobor 
and frugal turn both of mind and manners. In LefTudden 
there may be from 85 to 90 children, and elfewhere in the 
parifh from 50 to 55. 

The births, taken at an average for die laft 5 years, are 14 
annually, the marriages 5, and the burials 10. 

The poor on the parifh-roll, at prefent, are fewer than for 
fome years pad, being only 3 in number ; they receive from 
is. to 2 s. per week, which is raifed by an affeffment every 
half year upon the proprietors of land and their tenants, and, 
at an average for the laft 10 years, has amounted to abou,t 
14 1. 12 s. per annum. The money collected weekly at the

church, (which is from 5 1. to 61. in the year), together with 
what is brought in by the mort-cloth and the dues upon 
marriage proclamations, is employed by the kirk-feffion to 
give occafional affiltance to the neceffitous not on the poor's 
roll, and at times to add to the comfort of thofe who receive 
the bounty of the heritors. 

Fuel. — This neceffary of life we are obliged to procure at 
an expence which with difficulty we are able to afford. There 
are many cafes in which 7 a moderate competency of firing, to 
put over the feverity of the winter, takes moft of the money 
which a family of decent working people, after maintaining 
themfelves, can be fuppofed to fave. All honeft, though 
humble fhifts, are therefore made to provide and fave fuel. 
Coals are the common, and indeed the cheapeft firing. They 
are brought to this place either from the collieries in Lothian, 
which are at the diftance of 27 or 28 miles, or from Etal in 
Northumberland, which is 24 or 25 miles diftant. But the 
greateft part of what is ufed here, comes from the Lothians, 
and is brought by the returning carts, which carried from 
home oat- meal or grain to Dalkeith market. A cart with 2 
horfes commonly brings 14 cwt. of coals, which coft the pur- 
chafer 1 s. per cwt. and yet the driver is faid to have but 
poor profits. From this almoft unfupportable expence, which 
is more likely to increafe than decreafe, perhaps nothing can 
deliver this part of the country, unlefs the canal which has 
been fpoken of as intended to come to Ancrum bridge, 
fhould be carried into effect. To this fcarcity, and confe- 
quent high price of firing, may be imputed in part the too 
common complaint of rheumatifm, or what fome of the 
people call the pains, which are often very diftreffing, and 
too often not well treated by the patients themfelves.

Mifcellamous Obfervations. — There are in this parifh 102 
horfes, and 279 black cattle. Of the latter, 90 are milch 
cows. The number of Iheep cannot be exactly afcertained, 
as it varies in different years, according as the proprietors and 
farmers find it convenient to keep them. 

The Tweed, which runs clofe by Leffudden, in addition to 
the beauty and pleafantnefs which it gives to the country, is 
likewife productive of advantages. Between this place and 
Berwick, is a diftance of more than 30 miles; and yet not 
only here, but much higher up the water, fine and large fal- 
mon are caught in the feafon, and fold in the country at the 
moderate price of from 2 d. to 3 d. per lib. ; but the greateft 
part is bought up by people who find it their intereft to car- 
ry them elfewhere. Salmon of 28 lib. weight have been 
caught; but from 6 to 18 lib. is the ordinary weight of 
thole taken hereabouts ; fo that, at the proper times, the 
neighbourhood is feldom at a lofs for a fmall falmon, which 
proves a great conveniency to families, and contributes to the 
bettering of the circumftances of thofe concerned in the fi fil- 
ing.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15059253">NEWBATTLE</name>. 

(Prefbytcry of Dalkeith. — Synod of Lothian and Tweed- 
dale. — County of Mid Lothian.) 

By the Reverend Mr James Brown.</head> 



<p>Extent, Soil, C3Yi 

THE outlines of the parifh of Newbattle form an irre- 
gular triangle, the bafe of which pafles in a S. W. 
direction from Fordel-houfe to Newby res-tower. The other 
two fides meet in a point a little to the N. E. of the church. 
Its utmoft length and breadth may each of them meafure 4 
Englifh miies. 

There is a great diverfity in the foil of this parifh. In the 
valley which lies on the N. E. quarter, and which conceals, 
till a near approach, the church, the village, and family-feat 
of the Marquis of Lothian, the foil confifts of a rich loam, 
and is in many places 4 feet deep. As it refts upon a ftra- 
tum of fliarp gravel, the furface is fpeedily drained ; and 
hence the air of this place is much better than might be ex- 
pected from its pofition. From the valley the country rifes 
fouthward to its fummit, in the courfe of two miles. This 
hill traverfes the whole parifh. The foil on the N. fide 
grows worfe as one afcends, fhifting to a wet and whitifh 
clay ; but, when cultivated with proper fpirit and fkill, it car- 
ries very ample crops. The fouthern flope of this elevated 

track 



of Newbattk, 



213 



track fhows a furface marfliy and unproductive. In this pa- 
rifh, indeed, the extremes of fertility and of barrennefs bor- 
der upon each other ; for, on the S. W. quarter, there are 
many hundred acres worth fcarcely half a crown each of rent} 
while in the valley of Newbattle there are feveral inclolures, 
let for tillage, at 4 1, an acre. 

Upon the beft lands, the ordinary rotation is, ift, wheat 
after fallow ; 2d, peafe and beans ; 3d, barley, fown down 
with grafs feeds ; 4th and 5th, hay crops ; 6th, oats ; after 
which the ground is fallowed again, or cropped, where the 
foil is light, with potatoes. In the upper grounds, which are 
fwampy and expofed, the lands are kept feveral years in 
grafs. On its being broken up, a crop of oats is taken ; this 
is fucceeded by a green crop ; after which, the moft common 
method is to fow down oats with grafs feeds *. 

Minerals. — Limeftone and coals are found in abundance in 
this parifh, the whole of which may be laid to be under-laid 
with them. The coal, particularly, produces every year 
above 1000I. of free profit; and yet we felt as much as- 
many others, the recent fcarcity of that neceffary article. 
This evil was not, as fome have fuppofed, an effect of the in- 
creafing demand. The truth is, that the colliers can earn in 
three days as much as may fupport them very fully through 
the week ; they become diffipated and untraceable - } they in-

* Upon the higheft point of the hill already mentioned, and 
which is 680 feet above the level of the fea, there are the re- 
mains of an antient inclofure, well known by the name of the 
Roman Camp. Being crowded with firs, it is of difficult accefs, 
and cannot be examined with a proper degree of accuracy. It 
is ot a quadrangular figure, with an opening to the S. E. It 
contains nearly 3 acres of ground, and feems, from its polition, 
to have been wifely chofen, as a place both of defence and of 
obfervation.

fift upon making their own terms ; and, if the abufe of that 
liberty which was lately extended to them, could be admitted 
as a fufficient reafon for abridging it, many reftrictions might 
be fuggefted which would be ufeful both to the public and 
themlelves. 

Population. — According to Dr Webfter's report, the num- 
bers in this parilb, in the year 1755, amounted to 1439 fouls. 
By an account received from the former incumbent, they , 
confifted, in the 1779, of 1670 fouls; and, from a minute 
enumeration made of the inhabitants in March 1793, the ex- 
act ftate of the population is 606 males, and 689 females, or 
1295 fouls; of whom ioi7areof the eftablifhed Church, 
and 278 of the Seceffion. 

Hence it is evident, that, for fome years paft, the numbers 
of the people have been rapidly decreafing ; nor is it difficult 
to affign fufficient caufes for this uncomfortable fact. The farms 
now call into larger divifions, and tilled by fervants, many 
of whom are fingle. The village of Newbattle, which was 
once very populous, has been left to languish under many 
difcouragements. The lands of feveral proprietors and feuers 
have been bought up by the family of Lothian, with a view 
to the extenfion of their pleafure grounds and eftate ; and 
not a few, who once found employment in this place, have 
gone into fituations more favourable to their' induftry, and 
left the different villages of the parifh in a neglected and de- 
caying ftate. / 

The births, at an average of 10 years, amount annually to 
28 ; the deaths, taken at the fame average, to 32 ; and the 
marriages to 1 3 . Thus it appears, that the number of buri^ 
als is as 8 to 7, above the number of births ; but, when it is 
confidered, that feveral parents neglect the regiftration of 
their children's namesj and that many alfo who have left 

the 



of Nevubaitle. 



the parifh, are brought back to be interred with their ances- 
tors, thefe circumftances are perhaps Sufficient to account for 
this unfavourable balance. 

Poor, Ecclefiajl'ical State, and Schools.— There are 20 perfons, 
at a medium, who receive a monthly fupply from the kirk- 
Seflion •, they draw from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. each ; but, as the 
annual contributions, dues, and fines included, feldom exceed 
34 1. there has been a neceflity, upon two different occafions, 
of Supplying the deficiency by an affeffinent. 

The church, which was built in 1727, has an agree- 
able air of neatnefs and propriety •, and the manfe having 
undergone a late repair, is at prefent in very good condition. 
The ftipend, as augmented in 1789, confifts of 8 bolls of 
wheat, 24 bolls of barley, 24 bolls of oats, and 60 1. in mo- 
ney ; and the glebe, which lies at fome diftance from the 
manfe, contains 6 acres of excellent ground. 

The fchool was carried, many years ago, from this village 
to another, which, though nearer to the center of the parifh, 
is found inconvenient, on account of its remotenefs from 
the moft populous and frequented quarters. It is attended 
by about 45 fcholars, whofe wages, if well paid, would 
amount to 10 1. The Schoolmafter's falary, and his emolu- 
ments as feffion-clerk, may bring 12I. or 14 1. more ; a pro- 
vifion, it muft be granted, inadequate to the Support of a man 
of merit in an important profeffion. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatlons . — The farmers of this parifh,' 
though reduced in point of numbers, have improved, on the 
other hand, in their confequence and character ; and then' 
mode, both of thinking and living, is much more liberal than 
that of their predeceflors. The lower orders, when their 
manners are confidered, are likcwife entitled to a favourable 

report.

report. They are, for the moft part, induftrious, which pro- 
cures them a competence, and frugal, which preferves them 
m the pofleflion of this blefilng ; after which, it is unnecel- 
fary to add, that they are, in general, fatisfled with their 
condition. 

Newbattle Abbey, the feat of the Marquis of Lothian, is a 
large modern building ; and the plan of it, efpecially within, 
difcovers the tafte and judgment of the architect. In the 
library are feveral manufcripts in folio, written upon vellum, 
in the Saxon character ; and every page of them is adorned 
with pictures, emblematic of the refpective fubjects of which 
they treat. Of thefe books, the moft highly finifhed are,

John Tikyt hymni. 

Titus Livius, per P. Berceun. 

Augitjlin de la Cite de Dieu. 
And, in all of them, the figures are coloured and gilded 
with fo much delicacy and richnefs, as to afford a very inte- 
refting fpecimen of the labour and elegance with which they 
have been executed. Thefe manufcripts had, in former 
times, belonged to the Abbey, the monks of which were of 
the Ciftertian order. It was founded and endowed by Da- 
vid I. A wall furrounded it, which is almoft entire, and re- 
tains the name of the Monkland wall. The modern houfe is 
raifed upon the fpot which was formerly occupied by the 
monaftery, and (rands furrounded by a level lawn, containing 
about 30 acres of ground. It is watered, on the one fide, by 
the river South Elk, which, after toiling through the rocks 
of Cockpen, flows along the park in a quiet flream, and is 
over-hung with flourilhing plantations. On the other fide 
it is fkirted by a wsving line of woods, which, complying 
with the afcents and fwellings of the banks, are feen rifing 
above one another, and exhibit a beautiful variety of ftiades.

At the eaft end, it is terminated by an aged bridge, rudely- 
built, and overfpread with ivy ; ranges of trees, in the oppo- 
fite direction, clofe at a proper diftance into viftas : while 
the eye, in wandering over the beauties of the fcene, is caught 
by the fimple fpire of the parifh church, and by the fmoke, 
which, mounting from the adjacent village, lingers among 
the tops of the trees. 

In the bofom of the park are many fingle trees, which 
make a venerable and majeftic appearance. One of them a 
beech, at a yard above the ground, meafures 19 feet in cir- 
cumference ; the diftance between the tips of its extreme 
branches is io8feer; its trunk, before it begins to fpread, 
rifes to the height of 22 feet, and it contains, including its 
principal limbs, 7 10 cubic feet of wood. And yet this tree 
does not greatly exceed the dimenfions of many others in the 
parks. All of them, in their proper feafon, put forth a clofe 
and vigorous foliage ; ncr can any thing but a climate, and 
foil the moft favourable, account for their rifing, and fpread- 
ing to fuch a fize. From the fame caufes, the art of gar- 
dening is carried on very fuccefsfully around us. Green 
peas and cherries are pulled in this place, in the end of [ 7 jy, 
and beginning of June ; and, in a good feafon, the finer kinds 
of fruits arrive, without forcing, at their maturity and fla- 
vour.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3453658">RUTH WELL</name>. 

(Prefhytery of Annan.— County and Synod of Dum- 
fries.) 

By (he Reverend Mr John Craig.</head> 



<p>l^ameyExtenty &amp;c. 

SO far back as the fourteenth century, this parifh is cal- 
led, in a charter by Thomas Randolph Earl of Murray, 
to his nephew Sir William Murray, Ryval, and that name 
is continued in all fucceeding charters to Sir William's de- 
fendants. This, however, has been changed in more mo- 
dern times to Ruthwell, or more probably Ruthwald. Wald 
or wold in Saxon fignifying a wood ; the appellation is pro- 
perly applied, there being ftill extenfive natural woods in the 
pariih ; and, from the number of trees found in the rnoffes, 
it is evident that, at a remote period, they were much more 
considerable. The parifh extends from E. to W. along the 
Solway Frith, about 6 miles in length, and the broadeft part 
is not more than 3 miles : It is bounded on the E. by the pa- 
yifh of Cummertrees ; on the S. by the Frith; on the W. by 
the Water of Lochar, which divides it from Caerlaverock ; 
and on the N. by the parilhes of Dalton and Moufewald. 
The land rifes in a gentle acclivity, from the fea to the end 
of the ridge called Dalton Bank, which begins here, and ter- 
minates 



of Ruthwell. si 9 

minates in the parifh of Tinwald, a few miles to the north- 
ward, feparating the two valiies of Nith and Annan. 

\ 

Soil, Climate, &amp;c— The foil, though in fome places (hal- 
low and inclined to fand, is, in general, when properly ma- 
nured and managed, fufficiently fertile j and, as the expofure 
is good, the crops are early, a fingular advantage in this part 
of the country. Situated upon the fea, the air is of courfc 
moift, but by no means unhealthy. Many perfons from dif- 
ferent parts of the country repair here in fummer for the be- 
nefit of bathing, and fea air. The fea has rather receded 
from the Scotch fide of the Frith of late years, and the tides 
do not rife to the fame height they did formerly, fo that the 
land has gained confiderably, and large tracks of green merfe 
now appear, where the tides flowed over a furface of fand. 
It was, fome time ago, in the contemplation of Lord Stor- 
mont, the proprietor of thefe lands, to attempt an embank- 
ment for recovering a confiderable track of thefe fiat fands, 
and preventing their being inundated, as is done in Holland, 
but the violence of the tides difcouraged the undertaking, 
and nature is herfelf now performing what art was to have 
accomplifhed ; the green ground or merle extending almoft 
a mile further than it did fome years ago. At the mouth 
cf the Lochar there is a fmall port, where barks and little 
coafting veffels load and deliver coals and grain. 

Papulation. — The parifh is the property of four heritors, 
{but much the greateft part of it belongs to the Vifcount of 
Stormont,) of thefe only two are refident. The number of 
fouls is ic6i, whereof 5 19 are males, and 542 females. The 
inhabitants have increafed within this laft twenty years in 
the proportion of five to three, which may be afcribed firft 
to the divifion of large farms into iimller poffeffions, and 

particularly 



Statijlical Account 



particularly the extenfive track called the Mains of Comlon- 
gan, confining of above aoco acres, formerly kept for paf- 
ture ; and, fecondly, to the lime quarries lately difcovered 
near Comlongan, which have given employment to many la- 
bourers ; for whofe accommodation Lord Stormont has built 
a fmall viil .ge upon the fide of the military road, where a 
garden and a little polTefiion of land is inclofed and annexed 
to each dwelling houfe. — The return to Dr Webfter in 1755 
was only 599 fouls. 

Ecclefidjlical State, Zofc. — The church is an ancient fabric, 
perhaps now the moft fo of any in this part of the country ; 
it is a long building, remarkably narrow, and has a projecting 
aile or wing joined to it, which was formerly the burial place 
of the Murrays of Cockpool, and is now of the family of 
Stormont. The ftipend is 76 1. Sterling yearly, and is paid 
in money. The glebe confifts of 36 acres, a great part of 
which was laid off to the minifter at the divifion of a com- 
mon where he had a fervitude. The manfe is large and 
commodious, and built of brick about fixty years ago. The 
Vifcount of Stormont is patron. — The poor are not numer- 
ous, and are fupported from the weekly collections in the 
church ; where thefe prove deficient, a voluntary chaiitable 
contribution is made by the inhabitants, as often as they are 
called upon, and the fupply received upon fuch occafions is 
always fo ample as to anfwer the immediate wants or necef- 
fities of the poor, whether arifing from dearth of provifions, 
or other incidental caufes. There is a good fchool in the 
parifh, where children are taught Latin, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, navigation, and other branches of education 5 
and as fome come from diftant parts, they are boarded in 
the fchoolmafter's houfe, which is fitted up with fuitable ac- 
commodations. The falary is only 100 merks Scots. 

Villages 



cf Ruth well \ 



Villages and Roads.— Ruthwell, in which a privilege of 
fcoldiag markets and fairs was given by the old charters to 
the family of Cockpool, is the only village in the parith. It 
is a long draggling place, through which the high road from 
Dumfries to Annan palled, before the military road was 
made. The houfes were formerly all built of clay j but 
thefe have lately been pulled down, and the whole rebuilt at 
the expence of Lord Srormont with Hone and flates ; the 
ilrect has alio been enlarged, afc*d laid out in a ftraight line.— 
The high road from Portpatrick to England, made by the mi- 
litary at the expence of government, runs through this pa- 
rifh h om £. co W. And, in confequence of an act of Par- 
liament lately pafled, another road was laft year made to the 
northward, and running almoft parallel to the military road, 
which Ihortens the diftance between Annan and Dumfries 
fomething more than a mile. Tolls are now levied upon 
both roads. 

Manufactures, Fi/tjeries, &amp;c No fpecies of manufacture 

in the linen or woolen branches are carried on in this parifh ; 
but, in the fummer feafon, the people upon the fea coaft em- 
ploy themfelves in making a kind of coarfe fait, which an- 
i'wers the common ufes tolerably well. They practile the fol- 
lowing method: When the tides have rifen very high, and 
covered the fands for three or four days, a white cruft is left 
upon the fand, from which all the frefli water particles 
are exhaled by the heat of the fun during the neap tides, and 
the remanent fubftance appears to the eye like pounded cryf- 
tal. This cruft is pared off by a machine formed like a rol- 
ler, only the moveable part of the roller is here immoveable, 
and has projecting from it, about half an inch longitudinally, 
a piece of thin iron, which fcrapes up the cruft into heaps, 
together with^a portion of the fand. The whole is carried off 



Sifiti/lical Account 



in carts to the fhore, and piled up in one heap. When a 
fufficient quantity has been collected, the people dig a little 
fquare pit in the ground, at one end whereof they form, with 
tough ftrong clay railed a foot above the furface, a bafon 1 8 
feet long, 3 in width, and 3 deep, which riles, from the 
mouth of the little pit, in a gentle afcent to the further end ; 
the bottom of the bafon is laid with fquare white coloured 
peats, and above thefe, clean turf fods cut from the merfe 
with the green fides up, are placed, joined as clofe as poGIble 
to one another and to the fides of the bafon. After thus 
preparing the bafon, a layer about a foot and a half thick, 
taken from the heap of fand formerly laid up, is placed above 
the fods, and fea water being poured upon it, filtrates through 
the whole taafs, and, when it comes to the lower end of the 
bafon, runs off by a fmall tube into the pit or refervoir.. 
When the faline particles of the fand in the bafon are by this 
means carried off, it is removed, and new fand put in, which 
is managed in the fame manner. The proper ftrength of 
the liquor in the refervoir is afcertained by its carrying an 
egg j and when this happens, it is boiled in lead or iron pans 
until a refiduum of dry fait remains, which is taken up in 
wicker bafkets ; a liquid, foinething of the appearance of oil, 
runs from it, which the people call fait droppings, and efteem 
a good remedy for rheumatic complaints and fprains. The 
fait ihus made is neither fo white, nor fo ftrong as that from 
the fait pans. A meafure of it weighing about 24 lb. is fold 
for a Hulling i and, in confequence of an exemption or grant 
by one of the kings of Scotland, no duty is paid for it ; not- 
withstanding which, the tenants on the fliore who praclife 
this manufacture are fuppofed to be no confiderable gainers. 

Minerals, &amp;c. — At Brow, in this parifh within tide mark,

able, creates an appetite, and has been found beneficial in fto« 
machic complaints. When mixed with brandy, it changes to 
an inky colour, and a piece of filver put into it, is foon cover- 
ed with a black varnifh. Many refort to the Brow in the 
warm feafon, believing the well water, and fea bathing, fpe- 
cifics for all difeafes. Some appearances of coal have been 
found in different parts, but the expectations of thofe, who 
have attempted to fink a pit, have always been fruftrated, al- 
though it muft be admitted, that the ftrata in thofe places are 
fimilar to what is met with in Cumberland, on the oppofite 
fhore, where coal is found in great plenty ; the want of fuc- 
cefs, in this refearch upon the Scotch fide, may therefore pro- 
ceed from the inefficacy of the trials, and probably the unfkil- 
fulnefs and knavery of thofe employed in making them. 
Limeftone was accidentally difcovered in the neighbourhood 
of Comlongan about 10 years ago, and the difcovery being 
profecuted, and the quarry opened by inftruttions from Lord 
Stormont, all his Lordfhips tenants and the inhabitants of 
Moufewald, Toothorwald, arid Tinwald, have from hence 
been fupplied with burnt lime, and raw limeftone, which ha3 
contributed to the progrefs of improvement *. 

Difpofition of the Inhabitants, &amp;c — The temper of the peo- 
ple is benevolent and charitable, of which an inftance has been 

already 

* The air, as has been obferved, is moid, and often fo?cr V 
wh.ch, it is fuppofed, proceeds partly from the vicinity of the fea 
and partly from extenfive moires and deep bogs that are inter!

already mentioned in their voluntary contributions for fupport 
of the poor, when the weekly collections in the church prove 
inefficient. Living upon the fhore, many of the young men 
betake thcmfelves to a feafaring life ; thofe who continue at 
home, are farmers or labourers, with a few artizans, and are 
tolerably induftrious. The farms are in general fmall, and 
many of the farmers are befides jobbers or dealers in cattle, 
which they carry to the Englilh market ; they alfo breed and 
rear many fwine, difpofing of the hams in England or Edin- 
burgh, where they arc much prized ; thus trade is attended 
with confiderable profits. The number of farmers may be 
abotit 70, but among thefe are included fundry perfons who 
have fmall pofieffions of a few acres. There are in the parifh 
3 blackfmiths, 6 joiners, 5 fhoemakers, 2 doggers, 1 2 wea- 
vers, 6 tailors, 1 tinker, and about 75 day labourers •, the 
wages of thofe laft are from 10 d. to is. 2d. per day, and 
vary according to the length of the day. The wages of men 
fervants who are lodged and maintained, arc from 7 I. to 0 1. 
yearly, of women 3 1. or 3 1. 10 s. None of the natives of 
this parifh are feceders from the eftablifhed church ; but two 
perfons who lately fettled here are antibiirghers *. 

Fijhy &amp;c . — The fifh upon the coaft, are flounders of a large 
fize and good quality, herrings in the autumn, and cod and fkatc 

during 

* The wood-lark and bulfinch, birds extremely rare in Scot- 
land, are met with in the extenfive wood of Comlongan : They are 
both natives. They make their neft among the long grafs in the 
wood, and are, of late, cbferved to have much encreafed : There alio 
appeared in thofe woods, a bird of a new fpecies, of the fize of a 
thrufh, the back of a light brown colour, the head light gray, and 
the breaftalmoft white, the wings inclining to black,having a re- 

fularrowof fmall white fpotsacrofs the middle of each feather, the 
ill very Ihort, as thick as a mans finger next the head, and the tail 
has ftrong fhort feathers. This defcription agree much with the 
fize and figure of the Virginia nightingale or red bird, from 
which, however, it differs materially in the colour, and the want 
of the beautiful tuft on the bead,

during the winter. The flounders are caught in what is cal- 
led a pock-net, and fometimes the people grope for them 
with their feet in the fand, and kill them with a fpear; they 
frequently weigh from 3 to 7 pounds, and are remarkably de- 
licate. The herrings are caught in long-nets, extended upon 
poles fixed in the land. They are chiefly carried to Dumfries 
market, and are fold, in a plentiful filhing, fo low as 8 d. or 
6 d. per hundred ; they have however been fcarce on the 
Scotch fide for thefe four years part, which rhe filhers afcribe 
to the channels being altered, and running nigher the Englifh 
fhore than formerly. Cod and fkate are taken in fo fmall 
quantities, that they fcarce deferve to be noticed ; on the op- 
poGte coaft, they are very plentiful, and are brought acrofs 
the Frith, and fold proportionably cheap. 

Soil and Productions, tsfc.-— The foil is various, according to 
the fituation. Along the fhore it is dry and landy, and there 
is a confiderable tract of mofs ; further inland, it is a ftrong 
clay, and towards its boundaries on the E. and N. is a gra- 
vel ; towards the W. there is a bed of coarfe free flone, in- 
termixed with which fome limeftone appears. About 6^4. 
acres are employed in the culture of oats, 132 for barley, 40 
for wheat, 66 for potatoes, 30 for turnip, and 30 or 40 are 
laid down with -graft feeds. The little flax that is railed, is 
ufed by the inhabitants ; a few farmers in the weft fide of the 
parilh, have, within thefe late years only, fuftained lome Ip'ft 
in their crops of oats, by a fort of blight or blafting, which is 
lirft defcernible in the end of July, and, beginning in the mid. 
die of the field of corn, extends itfelf on all fides, till it has 
fpread over the whole, the ear is dried up, and the flalk 
breaks down, and is not worth the trouble of reaping. Dif- 
ferent kinds of manure have been employed, without effect, for 
the cure of this malady, and the people have alfo ineffeaual-

ly altered their mode of ploughing. It is fortunate, that this 
blight never attacks barley, wheat, or potatoes. The crops 
railed in the parifli, not only fupply the inhabitants, but afford 
a furplus of barley and potatoes for exportation. The ma- 
nures employed are lime and dung, and near the fhore the 
farmers lead and lay upon their lands confiderable quantities 
of lea fleech or fand, dug up within lea mark, which is ufed 
to great advantage in the mofTy foils, where lime is of no be- 
nefit *. 

V oluation 

* The only ancient building in the parifli is tlie caflle of 
Comiongan, the feat of the Vifcount of Stormont, which, al- 
though erecled fome centuries ago, is ftill entire. It was a con- 
fiderable place of ftrength before the Union of the Crowns, is 60 
feet lquare and 90 feet high, with battlements, and port holes in 
the walls ; the walls are of a fufficient thicknefs to admit of fmall 
apartments within them, and the hall and larger rooms are ftill 
occupied, as the roof is (landing. — The caltle of Comiongan 
was for many ages the refidence of the Murrays of Cockpool, a 
family of great eminence in Annandale, as fome of them were 
wardens ot the weftern border, and Cuthbert Murray of Cock- 
pool was one of the commanders of the Scotch army, that de- 
feated the Duke of Albany and the Earl of Douglas, when they 
invaded Scotland. John Murray, a younger fon of this family, 
having acquired a great eftate, as well in Scotland as in Eng- 
land and Ireland, was created, by Tving James the 6th, Earl of 
Annandale ; he afterwards fucceeded to the family eftate, and 
refided in the callle of Comiongan ; but the title became extinct 
upon the death of his fon withoutichildren, and Lord Stormont, 
who is heir of line, became proprietor of a confiderable part of 
the eftate. His Lordfhips grandfather, father of Lord Manf- 
field, refided here many years ; and, for his accommodation, added 
fundry buildings to thecaftle, which are now poffeffed by his fac- 
tor. The remains of an old caftle are alfo to be feen at Cock- 
pool, within half a mile of Comiongan, which was likewife a 
feat of the family. Ju the church yard of Ruthwell, a very cu- 
rious ancient monument appears, although now broken into two 
or three fragments, which, hrtwever, have all been preferved. 
The whole, when entire, feemsto have had the form of an obe- 
lifk, and was about 18 feet long; and the fide of each fquare is 
ornamented with figures, in relievo, defcriptive of facred (tory.

Valuation and Real Rent.— The lands in this pttnOi ftandva- 
Iued in the cefs books, at 2;o 5 merks Scotch. The real rents 
amount to about 1600 1. Sterling, and have been greatly ad- 
vanced within thefe few years, by the opening of the lime- 
ftone quarry at Comlongan, and the inclofures and improve- 
ments made by Lord Stormont and the other proprietors. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom.— -The divifion of the numerous 
commons in Annandale, the difcovery and application of lime 
as a manure, and the fyftem of inclofing, begun in this and 
other parishes, have produced the very extraordinary rife of 
rents, which have taken place within the laft twenty years ; 
and which, fo far from injuring or impoverifh'mg the tenan-

Our Saviour is reprcfented in different attitudes, and at the bot- 
tom of one of the fides, his crucifixon is difcernibie ; the borders

Tradition fays, that this obeliik, in remote times, was fst up at 
a place called Friellwoodtide near the fea, in order to all! ft the

dow, and placed in the church-yard, where it remained till the 
reformation, when, by an act of the General Aflembly, it was 
ordered to be thrown down and broken, as a remnant of idola- 
try. This piece of antiquity has been olten vilited, and exa- 
mined by travellers and antiquarians, and a defcription and 
draught of it is given by Mr Pennant in his tour, and by Gor- 
don in his Itinerarium Scptentrionale, where fundry other par- 
ticulars relating to it may be found. 

At a place called Kirkftyle in this parifh, ancient records fet 
forth, that there was very long ago a preceptory belonging to 
the knights of St. John, where they had a place of worfiiip and 
a burying ground, and that they were alfo poffefled of property 
to a great extent in the neighbourhood, which, upon the extinc- 
tion of that order, came into the polfeffion of the Murrays of 
Cockpool; but we have no certain accounts either from tradi-

try, have contributed to their profperity ; as it is a certain 
fact that at the prefent period they are better lodged, better 
cloathed, and have the nccefiaries of life in much greater 
abundance, than when their rents were trifling: yet the 
general fpirit of improvement in agriculture, which now per- 
vades Scotland, has not made fo rapid a progrefs as might 
have been expected in Annandalc. The purchafe of the [fle 
of Man, however, and the flop put by that means to fmug- 
gling, in which all the people living upon the Solway Frith 
were more or lefs concerned, hsve wrought a furprifing 
change on their induftry, as well as improved their morals. 
Although French brandy has, in confequence of thefe alte- 
rations, almoft wholly difappeared, its place is now occupi- 
ed by whifky, a fpirit equally fatal to the health of the people, 
though not fo hurtful to the revenue. This accurfed beve- 
rage is retailed in numbers of tippling houfes, and coming fo 
low as is. 6d. the Scotch pint, is greedily {'wallowed by the 
people, though it faps their conftitutions, and ruins their 
health. When the propofed wife'mcafures of allowing coals 
to be imported duty free, and laying an additional tax upon 
Scotch fpirits, are adopted by government, it is to be hoped 
that the more wholefome liquor brewed from good malt will 
again be drunk by the people, and their attachment to whif- 
ky weakened, if not deftroyed.

(Prefbytery of Auchterarder. — Synod of Perth and Stir- 
ting.— County of Perth. J 

By the Reverend Mr John Brown.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, Zsfc, 

THE parifh of Glendovan affords but few materials for 
the refearches of the curious. It derives its name 
from the Water of Dovan, which runs through it in a direc- 
tion nearly from W. to E. through a narrow glen, fcarcely 
in any place extending to the width of two furlongs, and, in 
many places, the hills rife immediately from the banks of 
this ftream. The windings of the river, the trees with which 
it is Ikirted in many places, and plantations now far advanc- 
ed, for which the foil feems particularly adapted, together 
with the verdure of the adjacent hills, afford a moft delight- 
ful profpecl. 

The parifh of Glendovan is fituated in the middle of the 
Ochill hills, (the great ftrath called Strathern lying betwixt 
it and the Grampian Hills ; on the N. a fine corn country ; 
on the S. the low grounds of Perthfhire and Clackmannan 
to the Frith of Forth,) extending in length from S. W. to 
N. E. 6 Englifh miles, and in breadth 44-. It is a hilly dif- 
tricl, but the hills are green and fmooth, feldom incumber- 
ed by rocks, and only a few fpots are covered with heath. 

Soil 



230 



Statiflical Account 



Soil and Produce. — The foil in the low grounds is light and 
dry, inclining to gravel. It is better adapted for grafs than 
corn, and yields excellent crops of natural hay. There may 
be nearly 100 acres under tillage, fcattered in fmall fpots 
along the fide of the water, but at an average not yielding 
four returns, owing to the rains incident to all hilly coun- 
tries. The farmers now perceiving the fmall advantage they 
reap from the plough, and the great profit of fheep, lay out 
more in grafs. In (lead of ploughing a confiderable way up 
the hills as formerly, they now let the lowell of their 
grounds lie in grafs. They have not turned much of their 
attention to the culture of green crops for fupplying fodder 
in winter, (which is often in great requeft,) though the 
trials made hitherto fufficiently prove that the fuccefs is cer- 
tain, and indeed the foil is particularly favourable to turnip 
hufbandry. They fow chiefly black oats, fome white oats of 
an early kind, rough barley, a fmall quantity of flax feed, and 
potatoes. In fome farms, there are confiderable tracks of in- 
clofed land paftured by cattle in fummer. 

Sheep. — The principal article attended to is fheep, in the 
management of which the farmers are much improved. It 
is only within thefe twenty years that they began to pay 
much attention to them. Formerly they depended upon 
grazing black cattle, and the care of their fheep was only a 
fecondary confideration. The confequence was, as might 
have been eafily forefeen, that what they gained upon the 
one, they loft upon the other ; and, though their rents were 
not one half of what they now are, they were with difficulty 
paid. The number of fheep in the parifh, at prefent, may 
amount to 8000. They are of the black faced kind, the 
farmers giving preference to this fpecies, both on account of 
its fize and its hardinefs. They have not, in general, come

to the method of rearing their own flieep, but keep up their 
flocks by purchafing hogs * every year from the Linton mar- ' 
ket. Jhofe who buy in, fell off their lambs to the fheep 
farmers in the Highlands, or to the butchers. A few, how- 
ever, have been in the practice of rearing their own fheep, 
and have in a great meafure fucceeded ; and all might do if, 
if they would referve their hog-fence for the winter, as is 
prattifed in the more improved farms j though, in general, 
they want heath, whins thrive wherever fown. Wedders arc 
fold at 4 years old at about 15 s. Moft of the farms rent at 
above tool, a year. The farmers endeavour to have one 
kind of fheep nearly by itfelf, but they allow them to feed at 
large, never collecting them uhlefs for fhearing, &amp;c. They 
fmear with tar and butter, mixed together, their hogs and 
fometimes their ewes ; and it is imagined it would be profit- 
able to fmear the whole, fince it is an effectual prefervative 
againft the fcab. The lambs are fometimes very fubjedt to 
the braxey, for which they have got no effectual remedy. An 
experiment has been lately tried to crofs their black faced 
fheep with Cheviot tups ; as far as can be yet known it pro- 
mifes fuccefs ; the lambs of this crofs breed are equally ftrong 
and healthy. Should that experiment anfwer the expecta- 
tion of thofe gentlemen who have beftowed fo much atten- 
tion on the improvement of fheep, it would be of effential 
(ervice to this place, as the farmers then would have a better 
market and higher prices for their wool. Their wool fells at 
from 10 s. to 12 s. and their laid wool at from 6 s. to 7 s. the 
ftone, of the former 7^ fleeces make one ftone, and of the 
latter 5 \ fleeces, both taken at an average. The difference 
in point of fize between thefe fine woolled fheep, and the 
black faced, of which their ftock now coniifts, is not confi- 

derablc,

derable, the latter felling as high, (if not higher) to the but- 
cher as the Cheviot fheep.

1 1. 5 s. and a horfe's worth 1 1. 10 s. The valued rent of 
the parifh is 1333 1. Scotch, and its real rent is more than 
doubled within thefe twenty years, extending to above 800 1. 
Sterling. There are five heritors in the parifh, two only of 
whom refide in it, and thefe farm their own lands. 

Ecclefiajlical State, CSV The church is old. The manfe 

was built in the year 1747, and hath been feveral times re- 
paired. The ftipend is 33 1. us. 6 T 4 2 Sterling. The parilh 
being early valued, the teinds are exhaufted, and there is a

legal glebe. There are few poor, and thcfe are fupplied by 
the ordinary collections. The fchoolmafter has jol. falary. 

Population, &amp;c— Pafture farms requiring few hands, and 
there being no towns, or what may be termed villages, within 
the parilh, the number of inhabitants are few, fcarcely amoun- 
ting to 200 of the eftablilhed church. They feem to have been 
more numerous formerly, although the i-eturn to Dr Web-: 
fterin 1755, was only 220 fouls. The number of marriages, 
during thelaft ten years, was 16, and the number of births 38. 
Befides thofe of the eftabliflied church, there are 5 burghers 
and 35 antiburghers ; there are one fmith, one malon, and 5 
day labourers. Moft of the work is performed by fervants 
hired by the year. Ai\ ordinary day labourer may earn 1 s. 
per day this, together with the economy and induftry of the 
wife, enables them to fupport their families comfortably, and 
give them a fuitable education. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom — The people are fober, induftrl- 
ous, and happy in their fituation. The grain produced in 
the parifh is not fufficient to fuppo r t the inhabitants, who are 
fupplied with this article from Strathern. They are very well 
fupplied with fuel, either with coals from Blairngcne 5 miles 
diftant, or with mofs from the hills *.

defence. It is one of thefe which were erecled in the 16th cen- 
tury by the chieftans, to protedl their vaflals against anyludden 
attack. It was built by the family of Crawford, to whom the 
lands of Glendovan, comprehending two large farms, viz. E. 
Glenfherup and Whitehills, belonged. It is longer than moft 
of the fame kind ; and muft have been built at a confiderable 
expence, as many of the ftones came from a diftance, by a 
road that was but lately deemed acceffible for carriages of any 
kind. This honfe was fometime in ruins, but was lately fitted 
up by the proprietor, for the accommodation of tenants.

The road which forms the principal communication between 
Strathern and Blairngone, has lately been made more accefli- 
ble than formerly, and fhould the plan, now propofcd, for the 
improvement of it, be executed, fuch an eafy paflage through 
fuch a chain of mountains would fcarcely be equalled. 

The practice of difmiifing the cottars and fmall tenants, is 
attended with fome difadvantages here. By this practice, the 
farmers often find it very difficult to procure hands to ex- 
ecute any work, which occurs at a particular feafon of the 
year, and continues but for a fhort time, and the nurfery for 
labouring fervants is cut off ; for the children brought up in 
the country, are much more healthy and robuft, not to men- 
tion other circumftances, and make better labouring fervants 
than thofe brought up in towns. A woollen manufacture might 
be eftablifhed in this place, or the neighbourhood, with ad- 
vantage. It would be fupplied with wool from the Ochills 
and the Weft Highlands, which are at no great diftance. For 
fuch a purpofe, a convenient fituation might eafily be found, 
on the Dovan, which would afford a conftant fupply of water*

THE name of this parilh is faid to be Gaelic, Cluny or 
Clugnie in that language fignifying meadows interfperf- 
ed with rifing grounds j a name defcriptive of the diftrict, 
which lies very low, interfered by many rivulets, fome of 
them pretty large, running in different diredtions, from the 
iurrounding hills, and forming a great deal of haugh or flat 
ground, which in floods are overflowed. Many places in Scot- 
land, and fome both in France and Spain, have the fame name, 
probably from a fimilar caufe. — Cluny lies in that divifion of the 
County of Aberdeen, called Mar, between the rivers Dee and 
Don. — The breadth of the parilh, (excepting in one place, which, 
is about 3 miles,) does not generally exceed two ; its length 
from W. to E. is about 10 miles. It has not been all mea r 
fured, but the two largeft eftates in it, Cluny and Caftle Fra- 
fer, have both been furveyed, and they confift of 2600 acres 
each, the remainder may be about one third of the whole ; fo 
that the contents of the parifli may be reckoned 6933 acres, 
of which about three fifths are in cultivation. There are no 
mountains, except one on the W. called the foreft of Con-

amy, which in that quarter is the boundary of the parifh. 
-There is now no wood on it, but probably there was fome for- 
merly. The Dominium direclum, as it is called, belongs to 
the Duke of Gordon, but the dominium utile to his vaffals all 
around, who, by their charters, have a right to fuel and paftu- 
rage in it. 

Rent, Soil, and Climate. — The valued rent of the parifh is 
2333 1. 6 s. 8 d. Scotch, and the real rent from 1000 1. to 
nool. Sterling. The foil in general is warm and dry, 
though not deep, except in the flat or low ground, and lies 
on a bed of mortar or clay mixed with fand. It is remarked, 
that wherever there are large blocks or maffes of granite, with 
which the diftridt abounds, there the foil is beft and moft 
productive. The climate, though humid, is warm, being fhel- 
tered by hills almoft on every fide, fo that the winters are 
generally mild. The fnow is feldom deep, and is but of fhort 
duration, nor are the frofts intenfe ; but mildews from the 
rivulets and marfhes are fometimes noxious to the crop. 
There are no epidemical difeafes. The moft common are 
rheumatifm, confumption, nervous fever, and fometimes fcro- 
phula. Of thefe, confumption is moft fatal. The fmall pox, 
which ufed to Carry off a fifth part of the human race, feems 
now to be lefs acrimonious, and inoculation begins to be ge- 
nerally prattifed. The ^clmiate is falubrious j and, in dange- 
rous diforders, thofe who are not able to pay a phyGcian, are 
always fent to the Infirmary at Aberdeen, where they are ge- 
nerally cured, and, for this inftitution, all ranks in the parifh 
make an annual and liberal contribution. 

Agriculture, Farmers, and Cattle.— There are 57 plough- 
gates of land and 40 farmers, who have ploughs of their 
©wn, befides thofe belonging to proprietors. The land is ge- 
nerally 



of Cluny. 237 

rurally ploughed by oxen, ten and fometimes twelve in a 
plough, yoked together in the old manner, by yokes and 
wooden bows ; except by heritors, who plough with two 
horfes and four oxen, and fometimes only two yoked with 
collars and ropes, which enable them to draw with greater 
eafe, as much as 10 or 12 oxen, yoked in the old manner. 
Improvements here are but in their infancy ; but as the heri- 
tors [how a good example, and the farmers are inclinable to 
learn, it is to be hoped they will be carried on to a confider- 
able degree of perfection. The old Scotch plough, which for 
lee and ftony ground is perhaps the beft, is yet generally uied; 
but the long ltilted plough with an iron head, and curved 
mould board, begins to be introduced. The ridges, which 
were formerly crooked and gathered up to a high top, leav- 
ing the fides thin and poor, are now made ftraight and level- 
led j and inclofures, which formerly were never attempted, 
are now begun even by the tenants, who gather the ftones 
out of their fields, and with them make fubftantial fences; 
the expence being advanced either by the heritors or farmers 
paying a certain iutereft, or by the farmers themfelves, on an 
obligation from the heritors for a reimburfement at the ex- 
piry of their leafe. There are in the parilh 801 black cattle, 
1300 iheep, 132 horfes, 2 waggons, 80 carts. About thirty 
years ago, there were but two carts in the whole parifh, and 
thefe belonged to the two principal heritors ; meal and grain 
are carried on horfes backs, peat, and turf, the crop and every 
thing clfe were carried in the fame way, becaufe the roads 
were in a ftate of nature. But between the years 1750 and 
1760, the gentleman of the county began to exact the ftatute 
labour ; for this purpofe, they divided the county into dif- 
tricls, according to the number of prefbyteries, and they ap-» 
pointed the commiffioners of fupply in each of thefe diftricls, 
to keep regular meetings, to call forth all the country people

between fixteen and fixty years of age, to work upon the 
roads, three days before and three days after harveft annual* 
ly, in the refpeclive parifhes, by overfeers named by them for 
that purpofe, under a penalty of is. 6d. for every perfon 
deficient, and to report their diligence at next general meet- 
ing at Aberdeen. The happy effects of this regulation have 
been general over the county. The roads have been repaired, 
and now not only farmers, but even crofters perform their la- 
bour with carts, to their great accommodation and advantage. 
Turnpikes are immediately to be eredled on the moft public 
roads in the county, and it is to be hoped, that as improve- 
ments go on and trade increafes, they will become general, to 
the great advantage of the community. 

Produce. — No wheat is fown in this diftri£t, and there 
feems to be an inaptitude in the foil for peafe and beans. On 
Dee fide, which is generally a poor foil, peafc grow without 
dung, but here they will hardly thrive on the beft land with- 
out lime, which makes them fo hard that boiling fcarcely 
foftens them ; they are rarely fown, therefore, in the field. 
The common crops are bear, oats, potatoes, and turnip, the 
laft but juft introduced, and which fcarcely can become ge- 
neral until the fields are inclofed. For want of inclofures, 
thofe farmers who fow turnips are obliged to dig pits for 
them, and clofe them on the top with the earth, to fave them 
from the cattle and fheep in autumn, but this is a great lofs, 
as the turnips ufually grow till Chriftmas. They are fome- 
timcs fown in drills, at the diftance of three feet between the 
rows, for the fake of horfe hoeing ; but broad-caft fowing be- 
gins to be preferred as producing a larger crop. Flax is on- 
ly fown by fome few families to make linen for their own 
ufe. Bear and oats with fome rye are the chief crops here ; 
but the hufbandry hitherto has been but very indifferent. 

The 



of Cluny. 239 

The infield is ufually divided into three parts ; one third is 
dunged for bear, after that produces two crops of oats, and 
is then dunged again for bear, without being allowed to reft. 
The other two thirds are always fown with oats, except a 
little that is planted with potatoes, which make a part of the 
ordinary diet of the family for two or three months in the 
beginning of winter. Every farm has at leaft ten outfield 
folds, fometimes more, befides faughs ; one half of thefe out- 
fields are always in tillage, producing commonly five, never 
lefs than four, fucceflive crops of oats ; after which they are 
left out to reft in fucceflion. The fold which has refted five 
years is made what is called a tothfold, that is to fay, it is fur- 
rounded with an earthen fence of a flight kind, but fijdiicient 
to keep in both black cattle and ftieep three or four hours 
every day about noon, and the whole of every night from 
I the end of May until the crop is got in. In autumn, this 
fold with the dung upon it is .ploughed up ; and, being fown 
with oats next fpring, produces a luxuriant crop, and a ftill 
better the fecond year, when the foil is more broke and re- 
duced, and better mixed with the dung. Even the third crop 
of oats is tolerable, but the fourth is poor, and the fifth ftill 
worfe. The faughs are a part of the outfield never dunged, 
land yet carry ufually five crops of oats, and never lefs than 
four, when in tillage, the other half of them is always in lee, 
but the crops, both of oats and grafs which they produce, are 
generally poor indeed. No marl of any kind has yet been 
difcovered in this diftrid~t, nor any lime quarry ; fo that the 
only manure is animal dung, and the afhes of peat or turf. 
However, the importation of lime {hells, both from the Frith 
of Forth and from Sunderland, (a boll of the former yield- 
ing two bolls and a half, and of the latter three bolls of pow- 
iered lime,) being now carried on to a great extent ; the far- 
mers begin to bring out fhells in fmall quantities, and this, 

with 



Statijlical Account 



with the dung of their cattle and dry earth, makes a very 
good compoft, with which they manure their bear land. 
When this is the cafe, along with their bear feed they 
fow red and white clover, rye, and rib grafs, which next 
year, and perhaps for two years, they cut for hay ; the third 
year, and foinetimes for the fourth and fifth, they pafture 
this field. When it is taken again into tillage, they take a 
crop or two of oats, then a crop of turnip, after that bear and 
grafs feeds, and then a crop or two of hay, after that pafture 
for one or more years ; and, in the fame manner, they man- 
age the reft of their infield. But this can only be faid of 
thofe few who bring lime from Aberdeen ; the reft, who are 
by far the greateft number, go on in the old wretched man- 
ner formerly defcribed. 

Fuel. — The only fuel made ufe of here is peat and turf, 
and thefe, in the greateft part of the parifh, are very fcarce 
and even difficult to be found, the peat mofles being much 
exhaufted, and fome of them totally at an end. There is, 
indeed, on the top and W. fide of the foreft of Gorrainy, 
abundance of mofs, but that hill being very high and fteep 
on the E. fide next to Cluny, and the mofs on the W. fide 
at the diftance of feveral miles, it is almoft impoffible to pro- 
cure firing from this place, efpecially for crofters and fubte- 
nants, who frequently have no horfes or carts of their own. 
The only refource, therefore, is coal from Aberdeen, with 
which the people here could fupply themfelves with toler- 
able facility, if the price were moderate, which it would be 
if the tax on coals was taken off*.

peal of the coal tax, for which the country is Co much indebted 
to the prefent patriotic Secretary of State Mr Dundas. 



of Chtny* 241 

. $ud Time, C5V. — Oats are fown here ufually from the 
middle or end of March, and bear is fown and potatoes plant- 
ed from that time to the beginning or middle of May, ac- 
cording to the feafon. Harveft begins commonly about the 
20th or towards the end of Augult, and is finished in the 
beginning or at fartheft the middle of October, unlefs the 
feafon be very unfavourable. In the year 1782, fo fatal to the 
kingdom, oats were cut out of inow and ice, in the beginning 
and even the middle of November; but having been full be-' 
fore the ftorm came on, they were thought to ripen even un- 
der the fnow, nor was it the froft that hurt the crop, and 
brought the meal to 1 s. 6d. a peck, but the want of wind 
to dry it, in conlequence of which it turned hot, and rotted 
in the corn yards. The ufual produce from the old mode of 
agriculture, at an average, is three or at raoft four returns, 
whereas by the new hufbandry, the returns are from ten to 
twelve, and fometimes more. The product of the diftrict is 
confiderably more than its conliimption, and the furplus is 
carried to Aberdeen, where there is a ready vent for it. 
Great.part of the rents, fometimes a half or more, are paid ia 
bear and meal, which the tenants are obliged, when requir- 
ed, to carry at their own expence to Aberdeen, or any place 
of the like diftance. Some years ago fervices of all kinds, 
called bondage, were exacted from the tenants ; but they are 
now moftly converted into money, to their great accommo- 
dation and advantage. No leafes are granted for more than 
19 years, and many for a much fhorter period. There is no 
village in the parilh ; the farmers and their fubtenants, wheu 
they have any, live together upon their feparate and refpec- 
tive farms, the rents of which are from 10 1. to 40 L  ue - 
fubtenants, by way of fecurity, lomdtimes pay the rent before 
hand, and of courfe have no rent to pay the year 01 then- re- 
moval. They feldom require or get a written leafe from

their landlords, but if both parties defirc to continue toge- 
ther for another year, upon Shrove Tuefday they are invited 
by the landlord to a dinner of beef and brofe, annually, which 
is the fymbol of the agreement for the enfuingyear. As the 
leafes are fo fhort, and no lime is to be found in the coun- 
try, the habitations both of tenants and fubtenants, efpecially 
thofe of the latter, are but mean, the walls being built of 
iionc, generally without mortar, and thatched with ftraw or 
broom, which muft be renewed every two or three years to 
keep them dry. They are, however, plaiftered with clay in 
the infide, and tolerably warm. But it is to be hoped that, 
as improvements increafe, the heritors will give their tenan- 
try better houfes, cr that the latter, upon getting longer 
leafes, v/ill be encouraged to provide themfelves in better 
lodgings, on obtaining obligations of re-imburfement, either 
from their fucceffors, or from the proprietors, at the expiry 
of their leafes. — There are five heritors in the diftritt, two of 
whom keep carriages, but only one refides, for fome part of 
the year, in the fummer months. 

Population. — By the return made to Dr Webfter in 1755, 
the number of examinable perfons, above fix or feven years 
of age, was 850. The total number of fouls returned to Dr 
Webfter was 994. Since that time, efpecially of late, it has 
decreafed, owing to various caufes*- The two greateft heri- 
tors have each taken a great quantity of land into their own 
pofleffion, in order to inclofe and improve it by draining, 
planting, Sec. and the people formerly refident on thefe lands 
have been removed. — Another caufe of the decreafe of inha- 
bitants, common to this and other diftri&amp;s of Scotland, is the 
conjunftion of farms, which, though it leflens the number of 
people in the country, yet tends to the general advantage, as 
a fubftantial farmer is more able to inclofe and improve his 

grounds,

grounds, than feveral fmaller ones lefs enlightened and of 
narrower fortunes. The vicinity alfo of the large and ma- 
nufacturing city of Aberdeen draws away not a few for trades, 
manufactures, and fervants. So that the number of fouls at 
prefent in the difiricTt are not many more than the number 
of examinable perfons forty years ago. The population in 
this year 1793 ftands thus :

Rent.— The rent of the beft infield to tenants is from 12 s. to 
15 s. to fubtenants, when tilled, 20 s. or 2 is.; of the outfield, 
from 3 s. to 6 s. per acre, according to its quality. The rents 
are paid twice in the year, at Candlemas, or fome time in 
February, when the price of the manufacture of {lockings in

winter is moftly collected, and in September, after the falc 
of cattle in the fummer markets is over, and the prices of the 
knitting of ftockings for the preceeding half year are collec- 
ted. The meal and bear is paid in, between Chriftmas and 
Candlemas. 

ManufaHurc. — The only manufacture, carried on in this 
diftrict, is the knitting of ftockings, in which all the women, 
and fome old men and b^ys, are employed the whole year 
round, excepting in harvefr. At this occupation, a woman 
will earn from i s. 8 d to 2 s. and fometimes 2 s. 6d. in the 
week. Manufacturers come frqm Aberdeen at dated times, 
and give out wool to the workers; and the ftockings, when 
wrought, are tent either co Holland or London, for which 
many thoufand pounds are returned to the county of Aber- 
deen. By the lofs of America, which was a good market 
for ftockings, by the rivalfhip of the people in Jerfey ?nd 
Guernfey, as well as Germany, and efpecially by the late 
invention of frames, this manufacture has decreafed in va- 
lue. Notwithstanding this, the people here prefer it to the 
f pinning of flax, which requires more confinement and ex- 
ertion *. ' e 

Rivulets 

* Forty years ago, the wages of a ploughman, who held a 
twelve oxen plough, did not exceed i6s."8d. befides victuals 
for half of the year; a ftout man get for harveft, 13 s or 14 s. 
and the wages of the bell women fervant for half a year, never 
exceeded 10 s. but now, tempora mutantur, the wages of a 
ploughman have rifen from 61. to 7 1. and even to 81. befides 
victuals, for the whole year. A' ftout reaper, in harveft, now 
gets 40 s. and the wages of a maid fervant have alio rifen from 
fl, 1 os. to 3 1. befides vidtuals for the year. Mafons and car- 
penters, and tradefmanof every fort, have raifed their wages in 
proportion. The hire of a day labourer formerly, never exceeded 
4d. and victuals, but is now come to 1 s. and even is. 3 d. a 
day without victuals, Ditching, trenching, and dyking, to-

Rivulets and Improvements .—Wo large river runs through 
the parilh, but the brooks and rivulets abound in trouts, pike, 
and eels. And the large rivulet or burn of Cluny, breeds pearls. 
Some years ago, a Jew employed people to fifh them, and a 
great many were got, fome of them large and of a good wa- 
ter, which were carried to London to be difpofed of. 

Improvements are ex;enlively carrying on by the two prin- 
cipal heritors of the diftrift, Mr Gordon of Cluny, one of 
the Barons of his Majeffy's Exchequer, and Mils Frazer of 
Caftle Frazer; the former ha., incioied 200 acres of land 
about his houfe, partly with hedge and ditch, and beautiful 
belts or (tripes of planting, partly with Hone dykes, and part- 
ly with ditches. He has alfo planted 200 acres of barren 

ground, 

gether with the manufacturers at Aberdeen, and the decreafe of 
fubtenants, diftrcls the farmers much for want of fervants. And 
even gentlemen find it difficult to get hands to carry on their 
improvements; but this evil, like many othf-rs, will ptobably 
cure itfelf. It wifi probably oblige the farmers to give up 
with the old hufbandry, which required many hands, and to 
betake themfelves to the new, which requires tcw:r hands, and 
yet produces more corn. The dreis of all the country people 
in the di Uriel was, fome years ago, both for men and women, 
of cloth made of their own fheep wool, Kilmarnock or Dundee 
bonnets, and fhoes of leather tanned by themfelves. Then every 
ieryant lad and maid had a qney or Iteer, fometimes two, and 
a fcore or more of fheep, to enable them to marry, and to be- 
gin the world with. Now every fervanl In! almoii, muft have 
his Sunday's coat of Englilli broad cloth, a veft and breeches of 
Manchefler cotton, a high crowned hat, and watch in his pocket. 
The fervant maids are dieiTed in poplins, muffins, lawns, and 
ribbons. And both fexes have .lit tie elfe than finery to enter 
the world with, which occafion^ marriage to be delayed longer 
than formerly, and own bfiiig's ifl c.s aiong w^th it. How 
devo"-;-,-, rlK-ff-.re, is it to be wifhed, that the patriotic la- 
bel: $ b{ llie Wuoi Society at Edinburgh, for meliorating the 
breed of fheep, a-nd the quality as well as quantity of wool, may 
fpecdily fucceed, and the benefits generally prevail over the na- 
tion. By this means, large fums would be kept in the country, 
which are now fent out of it for appajel, and tiie human ipecies 
alfo be multiplied.

ground, with all manner of forreft and ornamental trees, be- 
sides many detached clumps upon different eminences, which 
greatly decorate his eftate. But the moft valuable and fubftan- 
tial improvement about Cluny, is a large and beautiful mea- 
dow of 100 acres ; great part of which was formerly overflowed, 
and, being a marfh, was a defence to the caftle, but is now 
perfectly dry, and fit for tillage. Mr Gordon has alfo inclof- 
ed feveral parts of his eftate, which he has fet to tenants. 
Mifs Frazer, who by the death of her brother, has lately fuc- 
ceeded to the eftate of Caftle Frazer, is carrying on improve- 
ments with great fpirit ; and is to inclofe and plant an exten- 
five hill near her houfe, which, befides its ufefulnefs, will be 
an ornament not only to Caftle Frazer, but to the whole 
county. 

Eccleftajlical State. — The parifh of Cluny confifts of the old 
parifh of that name, and the half of the parifh of Kinearny 
thereto annexed, by decreet of the court of tithes, which 
took place in 1 743 ; the other half of Kinearny is annexed to 
Midmar, and the ftipend and glebe thereof pofiefied by thefe 
two minifters refpectively. There are no lefs than three Pa- 
trons, the Crown for Kinearney, the Honourable Baron Gor- 
don of Cluny, and Mifs Frazer of Caftle Frazer, for the old 
parifh of Cluny, per vices. The ftipend is 46 1. is. n4-d. 
Sterling, befides 2I. 15 s. for the half of the glebe of Kin- 
earny, 11 bolls and a half of bear, 52 bolls and one lippie 
meal at 8 ftone per boll. But it is to be obferved, that the 
ftipend is lefs than formerly, owing to the decreafe of fub- 
tenants and of the viccarage, tithes payable out of Kinearny, 
which have dwindled from 5 1. annually to lefs than 2 1. and 
will ftill decreafe more, as inclofing, which begins to be car- 
ried on, banifhes fheep •, at the fame time, that viccarage 
tithes are not only difagreeable to the people, but obvioufly 



of Cluny.

a moft inconvenient and detrimental mode of payment to a 
niinifter. The church being ruinous was pulled down, and 
a new and elegant one erected in 1789, not on the churcb- 
yard, but on a fmall eminence belonging to the glebe at a 
little diftance, for which Baron Gordon gave an equivalent 
to the minifter, with the concurrence of the Prefbytery. The 
rnanfe alfo being ruinous, a new and good one, together with 
offices, was built fome years after the incumbent's entry, and 
both rnanfe and offices have been fince repaired. There is a 
legal fchool mafter, who teaches Latin, Englifh, writing, 
arithmetic and book-keeping, and is attended by about 60 
fchplars in winter, and 50 in fummer. His falary is only 7 
bolls, 2 Iippies meal, at 8 ftone per boll, and 2 1. 7 s. 41 d. 
Sterling, in money, befides emoluments of teaching, which 
are is. 4d. Sterling, for Englifh, 2 s. for writing and arith- 
metic, and 2 s. 6 d. for Latin per quarter. It is much to be 
regretted, that fchoolmafters, who generally get an Univerfi- 
ty education, and are a moft ufeful clafs of men to the com- 
munity, fhould be fo miferably provided for, as to have 
fcarcely the neceflaries of life. 

Poor. — The number of poor varies from 8 to 14; none of 
them are mendicants. At the prefent incumbent's entry, the on- 
ly fund belonging to them, befides collections, fees of mortcloth, 
and fines for delinquencies, was 10 1. It is now increafed 
by favings to 70 1. the intereft of which, with the collections 
on Sunday, amounting to between 5 1. and 6 I. Sterling, and 
the collections at the Sacrament, extending to between 4 1, 
and 5 I. and the payment of a velvet mortcloth at burials, to- 
gether with the voluntary offerings of tranfgreffors, confti- 
tute a tolerable provifion for the poor, who are generally 
able to earn fomething for themfelves by knitting ftockings. 
The number of marriages in the diftrift, at a medi um, are

from 6 to 8, and the number of baptifms from 22 to 28. No 
regular lift of burials has been kept. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervathns. — There are no Roman Catho- 
lics, Seceders, Epifcopalians, nor fectaries of any denomina- 
tion in the diftrift, except one family lately come into it, who 
attend an Enifcopalian meeting-houfe in another parifh. All 
the other inhabitants attend the parifh church, fo much fo 
that about 500 of them annually communicate there- There 
are two licenfed houfes for the fale of ale and fpirits princi- 
pally for the fake of travellers, for drinking is much lefs the 
cuftom here than formerly, the people being fbber, decent, 
and induftrious. Several live to the age of between 80 and 
90. One died a few years ago at the age of 93, and another 
about two years ago at the age of 97 or 98, and was able to 
work till a little before his death. There are no mineral 
fprings of great vogue in the diftricl, though feveral, by the 
tinge of the water and of the Hones on their fides, have the 
appearance of chalybeates. There is a well, called the Tip- 
per Caftle well, generally reforted to forne time ago, not for 
its medicinal virtues, but becaufe of its having been conle- 
crated ; rags, threads, and lmall oblations in money were 
wont to be made at it to obtain particular bleffings, fo late as 
the fettlement of the prefent incumbent, but all thefe for a 
confiderable time have been effectually abolifhed. *. 

* There are three druidical temples in the diftridt, of the 
ufual circular form and fize, and three pillars, but without any 
infeription, one of them \o feet high, and 5 feet broad above

on the top of a fandy eminence, were four. J two (tone coffins, 
•or rather chefts, each confiding of four flat (tones laid on their 
edges, with a large flat [tone for a cover ; in each was found a 
human fkull and leveral human bones, together with an urn of 
■coarfe earth, or clay, and rude figures, with afhes in each, but 
different in fhape from Roman urns. Whofe remains they were, 
or at what time depofited, there is no tradition. There is alfo 
a muir with feveral (lone cairns upon it, where, according to 
tradition, there was an engagement in the reign of Charles I. 
.between the lrvines and For.befes, at that time two potent clans 
in Aberdeenfhire, the former Royalifts and the latter Covenan- 
ters, wherein fome upon both fides fell. There is alfo, in the 
archives of a family in the diftricl, a contract of marriage in the 
fifteenth century, between Andrew Lord Frazer, and Dame Ifo- 
bel daughter to Lord Forbes, wherein the latter obliges him- 
felf to pay to the former, on the high altar of Cluny, on the 
fealt and term of Candlemas, 500 merks and a green apron, by 
way of tocher good. On the top of two hills there are two 
very large cairns, which probably have been collected to kindle 
lires upon to alarm the country in time of danger, as many of 
the ftones have marks of fire upon them. There are two large 
cafiles in the diftridt, thofe of Cluny and Caflle Frazer, built in 
the beginning of the 15th century; the former by Sir Alexan- 
der Gordon, a fon of the Huntly family, and the latter by a 
Lord Frazer 5 both of a lingular form, with a fquare tower at 
rme corner, and a round tower at the diagonal corner, with lea- 
den platforms and parapet walls ; all vaulted below, and (ix fto- 
ries high, evidently intended for fortalices, the walls being two 
ells in thicknefs, and one of them, the Caflle of Cluny, having 
ftill a double barred iron gate, weighing thirty two flone, with 
mafly iron bolts, and the remains of a folic, once full of water. 
It is alfo remarkable, that there is a family in the diftrict, of the 
name of Robertfon, originally from Athol, who uninterruptedly 
have pofTefTed one of the largeft farms from father to fon, for a 
feries of upwards of 230 years. One of this family, the firlt 
Proteftant irvumbent at Cluny after the reformation, was a

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">SALTON</name>.

<p>
Name, Extent, 

THE parifh of Salton was furmerly the property of Ni- 
colas Soulis, one of the competitors for the Scottifh 
crown, mentioned in Lord Hailes's Annals, and was named, 
evidently from the Lord of the manor, Souliftown, by abbre- 
riation Soultown, and now, by obvious corruption, Salton. 

This diftrict is bounded on the W. by the parifh of Pen- 
caitland, from whence it is feparated by the rivers Salton and 
Tyne, which here unite, and form a pretty confiderable ri- 
ver, under the appellation of Tyne. From this river, the 
land rifes by a gradual afcent to the S. and S. E. exhibiting, 
until it reaches the village of Eaft Salton, a rich, regular, and 
improved furface. To the S. of this village, the face of the 
country, for near a mile, is lefs favourable, till it reaches the 
fouthern extremity of the parifh, where the furface in fome 
meafure refumes its former richnefs : As is the cafe with the 
neighbouring parifhes, a variety of foil is found, loam, light 
fand, thin clay, and a deep rich clay ; of thefe, however, the 
moft prevalent is the laft. 

Climate, 



Statifllcal Account 



Climate, &amp;c.— The air is dry and extremely falubrious, es- 
pecially in the higher parts of the parilh ; in confequence, 
few difeafes prevail. Many of the inhabitants attain a confi- 
derable age j and there are fome above 80 now living. A 
tradition is preferved, that fome centuries ago, when the 
plague vifited, with dreadful ravages, this country, Salton 
was the only parifh in the eaft of Scotland which efcaped ; 
an exemption imputed to the purity of the air, and the 
fmoke of the limekilns, which it feems even then abounded 
in the parifh. — Salton Hall, the feat of Lieutenant General 
Fletcher, is an ancient building, formerly a place of confi- 
derable ftrength, pofTeffing all the appurtenances of a regular 
fortification : It has been much ornamented by the prefent 
proprietor. The lawn in front is perhaps the fineft in Scot- 
land, commanding a rich and extenfive profpett. The 
garden contains many of the rareft exotics ; and, amongft 
others, the fuber, or cork tree, which was long fuppofed to be 
too delicate for our northern climate. Here, however, it has 
attained a confiderable fize in a common expofure. The 
pleafure ground is large, and affords a variety of romantic fce- 
nery, interfperfed with venerable groups of aged elm and 
oak, and enlivened with the delightful meandrings of Salton 
Water *. Hermifton, the property of Lord Sinclair, is alfo 
an ancient and fortified building. Many veftiges remain o£ 
its former ftrength. Its battlements, turrets, and fofTe, are 
ftill vifible. 

There are only two villages of any confequence in the pa- 
rifh, viz. Eaft and Weft Salton, fo denominated on account 
of their relative fituation to each other. Eaft Salton, the 

largeft, is fituated nearly in the center of the parifh, on the 

brow

tion of volumes, is perhaps the bed private collection in Britain.

brow of its afcent from the Tyne, and commands an exten- 
five profpeft of the richeft and moft beautiful parts of Eaft 
Lothian, with the fea, and the eaftern coaft of Fife, in the 
back ground of the landfcape. It contains 63 houfes, and 
281 fouls. Here the church and manfe ftand. Weft Sal- 
ton lies towards the weftern extremity, and contains about 
33 houfes and 127 fouls. 

Cultivation and Produce. — This parifh has been long re- 
markable for its fertility and excellent crops, and ftill re- 
tains its former character. All the different Ipecies of grain 
are fown with fuccefs, but wheat and oats are reckoned the 
beft crops. The excellence of thefe grains has been much in- 
creafed, fince the new mode of culture was introduced. The 
cuftom, which a few years ago prevailed here, of railing two 
or three white crops in fucceffion, impoverilhed the foil, and 
confequently diminifhed both the quantity and quality of the 
grain. This pernicious fyftem of farming is now, however, 
pretty generally exploded ; and the following rotation is fubfc- 
tituted in its place, viz. fallow, wheat, beans or peafe, bar- 
ley, grafs, oats. In this variety the foil fcems'to delight ; and 
the return upon the whole is much more for the benefit of 
the farmer. Another circumftance promifes to improve ftill 
farther the grain produced in this parifh, a renewal of the 
ufe of lime. So early as the beginning of this century, lime 
was adopted as a manure in this place ; its application, how- 
ever, to this purpofe was gradually difcontinued, and at 
length totally laid afide, from an opinion that it was of no 
advantage in the improvement of land. This opinion was 
founded on an idea, that, as the farms lay on a ftratum of 
limeftone, the foil muft of courfe be impregnated with it, and 
a further application would for this reafon be unneceffary. 
This prejudice, however, is daily lofing ground, and liming

is now very generally introduced into the plan of agricultural 
improvement, apparently with as much fuccefs as any where 
in the neighbourhood. — The number of farms amounts to 
15, confifting entirely of arable land, let at a rent of from 
15 s. to 1 1. 14 s. an acre. In the prefent rage for monopo- 
lizing and uniting farms, the extent of thefe may be reckon- 
ed fmall ; they contain, in general, from 80 to 200 acres, 
forming an aggregate of near 2000 acres. Befides thefe, 
there are feveral hundred acres laid out in conftant pafture, 
and in very thriving plantations. Before quitting this article, 
it may be proper to mention that the culture of turnips has 
been lately introduced, and promifes much fuccefs. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parilh is 5608 1. 9 s. 1 1 d. 
Scotch, paid by fix heritors ; of whom only one, Lieutenant 
General Fletcher, who pofiefles about two thirds of the pro- 
perty, is refident. Few inrtances occur in thefe days of dif- 
fipation and luxury, of the poffeffion of land being lefs fluc- 
tuating than in this parifh. The eftate of Sahon has been 
in poffeffion of the Fletchers fince the year 1643 ; and the 
family from whom it was then purchafed, the Abernethies of 
Salton, had been proprietors thereof from the year 1249. 
The eftate of Herdmonfton alfo affords another pleafing in- 
fiance of the fame kind, having been for centuries in the 
poffeffion of the prefent family.

Eccleftajiical State y — General Fletcher is patron. The 
glebe confifts of near 5 acres of excellent land. The ftipend 
is 40 1. 5 s. 6^ d. in money, and in victual 1 chalder of wheat, 
1 chalder of barley, 6 bolls of oats, and about 27 bolls of oat- 
meal. The manfe is a large but old houfe, built in 1659. 
The inhabitants are all of the eftablilhed church, except two 
who are quakers, and about 15 who are feceders. — The fef- 
fion record of this place goes back for near a century and a 
half. So early as the year 1635, a regiller was kept of D.tp- 
tifms and marriages, and the amount of the former, f om 
an average of 5 years, is 24 annually, being 5 above the 
prefent baptifm roll. This ancient record contains dSo 
ah account of the bufinefs of the feffion, and of the col- 
lection and expenditure of the poors money, written with 
much feeming precifion and accuracy : Even at that period, the 

provifion

average is taken) are very inaccurate and incomplete!

provifion for the poor appears to have been confiderable. It 
has fince, however, been greatly increafed ; and, at prefent, 
perhaps, tliere is no parifh of equal extent in Scotland, where 
the poor are fo amply provided for ss here. This provifion 
arifes from a funded principal of 700 I. bequeathed at diffe- 
rent times by the family of Fletcher of Salton, from collec- 
tions and mortcloth dues amounting to about 12I. a year, 
and from a bequeft of 150 inerks Scotch, annually, by the 
celebrated Gilbert Burnet, Bifhop of Salifbury, for the private 
diftribution of the minifter of the parifh. Thefe different 
fums, amounting to about per annum , are fully fufficient 
for the exigencies of the poor. A part is laid out in the pur- 
chafe of meal for the monthly fupply of 20 indigent perfons, 
whofe names are inferted in the poors roll •, part in the pay- 
ment of houfe rents, and the remainder for the relief of in- 
cidental neceffity. 

Several years ago, two academies were eftablifhed in this 
parifh 1 through the public f'pirit of the late proprietor of Sal- 
ton, Mr Andrew Fletcher, and the former incumbent, Mr 
Bannerman. They were fupplied with able teachers ; and one 
was appropriated to the education of boys, the other of girls. 
The characters of the teachers, and the peculiar healthinefs 
of the fituation, added to the laudable zeal of the patrons of 
the inftitution, foon procured a number of boarders of both 
fexes, from various parts of Scotland. The inftruction was 
not confined to the more common parts of education ; it in- 
cluded alfo its higher and politer branches, mufic, mathema- 
tics, natural philofophy, and aflronomy, for which proper ap. 
paratus was procured. The fuccefs of this inftitution, for fome 
time, gratified completely the wifhes of its founders, and was 
attended with much emolument to the parifh. This fuccefs, 
however, did not long continue, and the plan was unaccount- 
ably laid afide a few years after its commencement. No at- 
tempt

empt at a re-eftablifhment is now thought of, and the houfes, 
which were extremely commodious, and built at a confider- 
able expence, are now made ufe of for a very different pur- 
pofe. The children of this place, however, are full well fup- 
plied with the means of education. There are two fchools for 
their accommodation, with well qualified teachers, whofe re- 
fpedtive falaries, including every emolument, may amount to 
25 1. per annum. There is alio a fchool miftrefs, with a falary 
of 10I. per annumy who teaches fewing, &amp;.c. Each of thefe 
teachers is furnilhed with a houfe, fchool-houfe, and garden, 
and the number of fcholars, at the three fchools, may be about 
10a. The parish has been enabled to make this very liberal 
provifion, for the education of its youth, by means of the 
munificent donation of Bifhop Burnet. In the year 1711, he 
bequeathed 20,000 merks Scotch, to the parilh of Salton j the 
annual rents to be applied to the following purpofes, viz. the 
education and cloathing of 30 children } the payment of their 
apprentice fees ; the relief of the indigent ; and the annual in- 
creafe of a library in the manfe, intended for the fole ufe of 
the minifter of the parifli. Of this fund, the JLords of Coun- 
cil and Seflion were nominated infpe&amp;ors, and, by their ap- 
pointment, the proprietors of the eftates of Salton and Her- 
mifton, together with the minifter of the parifh, a£t as truf. 
tees. Under the judicious management of thefe truftees, the 
funds have increafed to a capital of upwards of 2000 L Ster- 
ling, by which means, the various purpofes of the donor's will 
are completely complied with. The children are well cloth- 
ed, properly educated, and inftruttcd in fome refpedtable trade. 
The poor are comfortably provided ; and the minifter's library 
is fuppiied with moft of the ancient and modern clafEcs. 

ManufaElures — The only manufactures of any confequence 
ia the parifh, are a ftarch-work, which employs 8 perfons, a

paper-mill, which employs 8, and a bleach-field, which employs 
7. It was not fo formerly. In the beginning of this century, 
the art of manufacturing pot barley, and of weaving hollands, 
was introduced into this pariSh, and exclusively pradtifed to 
the great emolument of the inhabitants, who, for feveral years, 
Supplied the whole of Scotland with thefe important articles. 
Thefe arts owe their introduction to the patriotism of the Lady 
of Henry Fletcher of Salton. Animated with a defire of in- 
creafing the manufadtorie of her country, this lady travelled 
to Holland with two expert mechanics, in the habit of Ser- 
vants. Her rank procured her eafy accefs, together with her Sup- 
pofed domeftics, to the manufactories ; and by frequent vifits, 
the fecrets of operation were difcovered ; models of the vari- 
ous works were formed by the difguifed artifts ; and the parifh 
became poflefled of two difcoveries, which were a wonderful 
faving to the nation. In the year 1750, too, the firft bleach- 
field, belonging to the Britifh Linen Company, was formed in 
this place, under the patronage of the famous Lor.d Milton. 
During his Lordfhip's life, it was conducted with much fpirit } 
no expence was fpared in procuring from Ireland, the moft 
expert work-men, and it became at laft fo very flourishing, 
as to afford employment to upwards of 100 perfons. But (la- 
bility is the character of none of the works of men ; the 
bleach-field has for many years been converted into delight- 
ful pleafure ground, inhabited by beings very different from 
thofe that are to be found in a fuller's field. 

Minerals.— A Stratum of limeftone rock pervades almoft 
the whole pariSh. It is of an excellent quality, and has been 
wrought from a very remote period, both for the purpofes of 
agriculture and of building, As it abounds in moft of the 
farms, the fale of it was formerly of considerable emolument 
to the reSpeaive tenants- This privilege, however, has of late 

.years, 



of Salton, 



years, for obvious reafons, been taken from the farmers. 
Two excellent draw-kilns have been erected. The lime quarries 
have been let in leafe to a fingle tackfman, who gives employ- 
ment to near ^40 workmen, and fupplies great part of the 
county with limemell, at 1 s. per boll. Under this ftratum of 
limeftone, there is every reafon to believe, from fome flight 
experiments made, that a fine feam of coal may be found. 
But there are fo many excellent coaliieries in the neighbour- 
hood, it has not hitherto been reckoned an object to work it. 
Befides thefe foffils there is alfo, on General Fletcher's pro- 
perty, an extenfive freeftone quarry, which is eafily wrought, 
and of a very fuperior quality *. 

Mifcellaneous Obferuations. — The inhabitants are decent in 
their deportment, frugal and induftrious, and remarkable for

* Salton is entitled to vie with mod of the parifhes of Scot- 
land, in the honour of giving birth, or affording refidence, to 
the greateft number of eminent chara&amp;ers. In the firft clafs, 
fhe is proud to enrol the name of Dunbar, the .Horace of his 
country. . This favourite of the Mufes was born at Salton in 
the year 1465. In the earlier period of his life, he was a friar; 
but he foon relinquifhed the profeffion of a Monk, for that of a 
poet, and by the lingular excellence of his compofitions, attrac- 
ted the royal attention ; became a favourite at the Scottifh Court ; 
and was admitted a companion of all their felecl parties. The 
verfatile genius of Dunbar, qualified him completely for min- 
ing in thefe. Of all the productions of this bard, his Golden 
Terge*, and his Thiftle and Rofe f , have been moil generally 
admired. 

Burnet, bifhop of Salifbury, comes next in the lift of genius 
and merit. He was not indeed a native of Salton ; but he fpent 
five years of his life as rector of the parifli, and it was here his 
clerical career began. In 1669, he was invited hence to the di- 
vinity chair in.Glafgow. This refpedable office, he filled with

their attention to the ordinances of religion. For thefe many

much credit and ability, till 1674, when t lie political jealoufics 
of the times, obliged him to relinquifh his chair and his country. 
This temporary inconvenience was abundantly compenfated on 
the acceflion of King William ; and, under the patronage of this 
Prince, his genius and merit obtained their due reward. He 
attained a high place in the efteem of his Sovereign, and filled 
a very dignified ftation in the church. 

This parifh was the birth place of Andrew Fletcher of Sal. 
ton, the famous patriot, who was for fome years the pupil of 
Burnet. From this great man, he feems to have imbibed much 
of that liberal atod independent character, which he difplayed 
through Jife. His political principles, which were truly repub- 
lican, difgufted him completely at the defpotic reigns of Charles 
and James, and made him engage keenly in every project, for the 
recovery of the conftitution and liberties of his country. He 
was in the fecret councils of Lord Ruffel, and was a principal 
leader in Monmouth's expedition. His abilities as a ftatefman 
■were unrivalled in his rime. 

Lord Milton, nephew to this great man, and not inferior to 
him in patriotifm, was alfo a native of Salton. He was born 
in the year 1692, educated to the profefhon of the bar, admit- 
ted an advocate, appointed a Lord of Seffion, and at length raifec 
to the diftinguilhed office of Lord Juftice Clerk. It was in this 
high ftation, that he did his country efiential fervicc, during the 
unhappy rebellion in 174c. The conduct of almoft the whole 
public affairs of Scotland fell upon him, and thefe he managed, 
with Fuch an uncommon degree of difcretion, temper, and mo- 
deration, that the impetuofity of wanton punifnment was ref- 
trained, and lenient meafures adopted in favour of thofe, whom 
indifcertion or ignorance had betrayed into hoftility. He over- 
looked many of the informations, wh'rh were brought to his of- 
fice; and it'is ftated here from the heft authority, that after his 
death, many fealed letters, containing fuch information, were 
found unopened amor.g his other papers. With the fame patrio- 
tic views, he engaged zealoufiy in the abolition of heritable 
iurifdiclions, which' had long been inimical to order and to juf- 
tice : With unremitting ardour, he purfued every fcheme that 
could promote the trade, manufactures, agriculture, and reform- 
ing of his country.

neighbours. In the village of Eaft Salton, there is a weekly 
market, where the different kinds of butcher meat are fold, 
of excellent quality, and at moderate prices. They are in 
the vicinity too of excellent coal, fold at the pit for 3 1 d. per 
load of 2 cwt. The water in the parifli is extremely falubri- 
ous, running over a bed of limeftone. It is at all feafons un- 
commonly cool, and is reckoned peculiarly proper for culi- 
nary purpofes. — Near the houfe of Saltcn is a mineral fpring, 
the properties of which have been only difcovered within 
thefe 12 years. In the opinion of an eminent phyfician, to 
whom it was fhown, it is in no rtfpedt inferior to the medi- 
cinal waters of Briflol, pofTefling the fame qualities, as the 
water of thefe celebrated wells; it is without fmell, peculiar- 
ly foft, pleafant, and agreeable to the tafre, and has been 
kept for years in a corked bottle, without any fenfible lofs of 
its properties. Salton affords an advantageous fituation for- 
the eftablifhment of rnanufa&amp;tures. Fuel and provifions are 
cheap; and the rivers Salton and Tyne afford a range of two ■ 
miles, very convenient for the erection of fuch manufactures 
as require being conducted by water. It is within 6 miles 
alfo of a good fea port, where the manufactures might be flip- 
ped 10 any quarter of the globe.

<p>Extent, Name, &amp;c. 

T | "*HE parifh of Morven is bounded by the Sound of Mull 
JL from S. E. to N W. dividing it from the large ifland 
of that name to the weftward ; on the N. by that arm of the 
fea called Loch-Suineart, dividing it from the parifli of Ard- 
namurchan. It has been computed to be 14 miles in length, 
along the Sound of Mull ; but the whole length of the parifli, 
taken from Tearneat on the E. to Auliftein on the W. can- 
not be lefs than 20 miles. Its greateft breadth is 10 com- 
puted miles. It forms a large peninfula, of which the 
Ifthmus, from Strontian at the head of Loch-Suineart to the 
weft fhore of Linnehellih, in a ftraight line from fea to fea, 
is about 6 miles over. — As this parifli was never wholly fur- 
veyed, it is difficult to form a conjecture what number of 
acres it may contain ; but, from a partial furvey and menfura- 
tion made, it cannot be much below 60,000. The modern 
name Morven, or Morvern, as it is more properly called, be- 
ing the method of fpelling it in ancient records, and much 
nearer the uniform pronunciation of the inhabitants, is plain-

Surface y Soil, &amp;c. — The general appearance of this parifli 
is hilly, but without mountains of any remarkable height. 
Its hills are partly covered with heath, but for the molt part 
yield good pafture. The inhabitation is along the fea fide 
all around, the inland parts being moftly hilly, and the ar- 
able ground lying at the bottom of thefe hills. Along the 
Sound of Mull, the arable ground (fuch we call it) is upon a 
declivity, in many places very fteep, and much elevated above 
the level of the fea. The foil, in general, is a poor, light, 
open earth, interfperfed in fome places with a mixture of 
gravel and fmalf ftones ; fome fpots that lie lower, and are 
flatter, anfwer well for fuch kinds of crops as are generally 
raifed iu this country ; thefe are, barley, potatoes, and oats of

* To thofe who are acquainted with the Gaelic language, it 
will appear evident, that the meaning of this name muft be dif- 
ferent from the word Mor Ven, as ufed in the Poems of Offian, 
where it is derived from the Gaelic words « Mor-Bheann,' i. e. 
« of the great mountains,' and feems to have been a general 
term for the Highlands, or hilly country. The common notion is, 
that the whole Highlands were the country of Fingal and his 
heroes, for in every part thereof, as well as in this parifti, there 
are names derived from them and their achievements. The 
whole Highlands might jultly be called * Dnthaicb nam ?wr y

guft rains, and autumnal ftorms. The whole of the parifti, 
efpecially the weft fide, or that part which looks towards the 
Sound of Mull, is fo much expofed, that the railing of crops 
of any kind is always a precarious bufinefs, and, in lbme fea- 
fbns, a certain lofs. For this reafon, moft of the inhabitants, 
efpecially the gentlemen tackfmen, have now turned their at- 
tention to grazing and rearing of cattle. 

It is obfervable in this, and it is believed, in the neighbour- 
ing parifhes, that the weather has of late become more 
changeable, and it is an inconteftible faft that rain has fallen, 
(during fome years paft) in by far greater quantities than the 
oldeft inhabitants remember. This does a material injury to 
all kinds of crops, occafions late harvefts, which baffle the 
hopes of the farmer, and fubjecT: him to many vexatious 
lofles and galling difappointments. Although the climate is 
thus generally moift and rainy, the parifh is far from being 
unwholefome. During the incumbency of the prefent mini- 
Iter, many have died betwixt the age of 80 and 90, and fome 
even above 90 •, and there are now living feveral above 80, 
particularly one man and his wife, who were married more 
than 60 years ago, and whofe faculties and ftrength are fo 
far from being impaired, that they continue to follow their 
refpe&amp;ive employments with aftonifhing alacrity and vigour. 
The moft common ailments are colds and rheumatifms, of 
which few people are fuppofed to die ; but whether thefe 
bring on other ficknefTes or difeafes, which end in death, it is 
the province of phyficians to determine. 

Seed Time, Harvejl, Crops, cfrV.— -In a climate fo wet, it is 
not to be fuppofed that fowing can commence early : We 
commonly begin about the middle of March, and, unlefs the 
feafon proves unfavourable, expect to cut down about the 
latter end of September. From our lmall oats we have but

returns, but become worfe and worfe every year after the f©- 
cond fowing; and, if new feed be not procured, in the 
courfe of very few years degenerate to the quality of fmall 
oats. From a boll of barley, we generally get 4, 5, or 6 feeds, 
and there are inftances of good fpots, well drefled and ma- 
nured, returning 16. From potatoes planted in lazy beds (which 
ufed to be the general method throughout the parilh) ten- 
fold is reckoned a good return. Some have of late begun to 
raife them from the drill, from which great advantage is de- 
rived, that method producing from 15 to 25 returns: It is 
hoped this will foon be the general practice, as the people 
are fond enough of their intereft where they can fee it. 
Want of encouragement to inclofe grounds for hay has hither- 
to prevented the tackfmen from attempting to raife grafs 
from feeds. Soaie attention to green crops would probably 
be found more profitable in this climate than the inhabitants 
are aware of. This they may become fenfible of in time ; and 
it takes time to introduce a new fyftem into any country. 

Farms, Produce, and Stock. — The method of uniting farms 
began long ago, and feems to be gaining ground id pro- 
portion to the avidity for high rents, and the rage for fheep 
ftocks. It may be queftioned, whether the letting of land 
in large tenements be not on the whole more proper for this 
country, than the old method of fetting it in fmall portions. 
There is a much greater proportion of hill than of low 
ground ; and a tackfman occupying from 5000 to 7000 acres, 
(of which there are inftances in this parifh) is much more 
able than a number of poor people can be to carry on im r 
provements, by building proper houfes, making neceffary in- 
clofures, and by introducing new modes of managing ground

nnd (lock. But this union of farms cannot be faid to be 3n 
favour of population, though, if proprietors would allot fmall 
fpots of ground at an eafy rate to the poorer people, and be 
nt pains to eftablifh manufactures among them, the improve- 
ment of the country and population might go hand in hand • 
the people might keep their country and live happy, and the 
proprietors in the end would find it redound much to their 
credit and intereft. There has, indeed, no emigration to 
America taken place from this parifh as yet, but a yearly 
drain to the low country for fervice, &amp;c. owing to the 
union of farms, and the general poverty of the country, 
where there are no manufactures to employ, and little pro- 
duce to fupport the inhabitants.— The farms, as prefently 
poiTefied, are 32 in number, of which 17 are in the hands of 
gentlemen tackfmen, and for the moft part flocked with 
iheep ; 5 in leafe to fhepherds ; and 10 occupied by fmall te- 
nants. The annual average of kelp manufactured and fold 
may be about 70. tons ; and the common rate of manufactur- 
ing it is 1 1. 10 s. per ton. — The exports are, cows, horfes, 
iheep, wool, kelp, timber, and barks. The imports confift 
of many articles j the principal of which are, meal yearly in 
great quantities, tanned leather, iron, tar, ropes, fmearing 
butter, merchant goods of various kinds, &amp;c *. 

Roads, 

* The common prices of labour are, a man fervant, for a 
year, from 4I. to 5 1- ; a fingle woman from 1 1. 5 s. to 2 1. ex- 
clufive of (hoes and maintenance, and other perquifites, all which 
are daily increafing in value. Formerly farms weie generally 
managed by married, or cottage, fefvants, with us called work- 
men. The common encouragement for thefe was holding of 5 
pr 6 foums in cows and flieep, which was then valued at 10 s. 
the fottm; with us they had one fourth part of what crops were 
jnade, and maintenance throughout the year, except the time 
employed in ploughing the ground and reaping the crops; this 
mode was found very inconvenient and expenfive, and is now aU 
moft totally difufed. A day labourer earns 1 s. per day 5 taylors are

Roads, Rivers, &amp;c— As to the roads of this parifh little 
can be faid. The line of road along the coaft of the Sound 
of Mull is, by the application of the ftatute labour, for the 
molt part rideable ; through the other parts of the parifh fo 
little has been done to them, that they may be faid to remain 
this day as nature left them: The people, however, are now 
becoming more fenfible of the advantages that would arife 
from good roads ; though from their fcattered fituation, and 
the want of refiding heritors to bring them forward, the 
work proceeds but flowly. — There are many rapid torrents 
pouring down from the hills to the fea ; fome of which are 
fo confiderable, as to be always impaffable in times of heavy 
rain. Ten of thefe are more dangerous than the reft, on ac- 
count of the greater quantity of water, and the coarfenels of 
their channels. Of all thefe, three only have got bridges 
over them, and one of the three is in fo ruinous a condition 
as to be hardly fafe for paffengers. — There are fome very 
valuable ftools of natural woods in many parts of the parifh, 
particularly along the whole Loch-Suineart fide, confifting 
chiefly of birch, interfperfed with fome valuable fpots of 
oak and afh, alfo around the fouth eaft end of the parifh, 
facing the Sound of Mull, and at the head end both fides of 
Loch-alin Bay. The refpedtive proprietors of thefe woods be- 
nefit themfelves much by felling them off to the Lorn-fur- 
nace company or others for charcoal, Sec. the manufacturing 
of which mud be fuppofed very ferviceable to the poor of 
this and the neighbouring parifhes. During the Iaft feven 
years, a fum of 8000 1. or io,ocol. Sterling has been expend-

day, exclufive of maintenance ; a boat carpenter, joiner, cowan, 
(or builder of (lone without mortar,) get i s. at the minimum, 
and good maintenance ; a fhepherd has from 7 1. to 10 1. per an- 
hum, befides maintenance and fhoes 5 weavers are paid by the 
meafure, and according to the quaiity of the fluff.

ed on thefe works in their different branches, viz. cutting, 
piling, burning, leading, peeling of bark, &amp;c 

Fijfnng, — At the head of Loch-alin, there is a falmon fifh- 
ing, of fervice to the people concerned, but the exports are 
not considerable. On the north fide of the parifh, or near 
the head of Loch Suincart, herrings are found fometimes in 
great abundance, of good fize and quality, in the months of 
Auguft and November, which would be of confiderable ad- 
vantage to this and the neighbouring parifhes, were there a 
certain and eafy method of fupplying the inhabitants with 
fait \ but this is not the cafe ; a circumfiance very difcourag- 
ing to the fiiher, and detrimental to the community at large. 
This was particularly felt in the year 1790. as no fait could 
be found in any of the neighbouring cuftomhoufes of Tober- 
mory, Oban, or Fort-William, at the time needed ; the con- 
fluence was the lofs of many of the herrings. — The other 
kinds of fifh, found on thefe coafts, are feathe, red or rock- 
cod, fkate, lythe, flounder, mackarel, fea perch, dog-fifh, 
gurnet, eel, and, at the mouth of almoft every river, fmall fal- 
mon, and white trout ; befides a variety of fhell-fiih, fuch as, 
oyrters, cockles, lobftcrs, crabs, mufcles, limpets and peri- 
winkles, fpout fifh, &amp;c There are alfo found marine vege- 
tables, dulfe, and flake, which are much efteemed by thofe 
who are in the habit of ufing them. Thefe articles, though 
of fervice to the inhabitants, are never found in fuch quan- 
tities as to be fent to market *. 

Ferries t 

* The fea fowls are, ducks of various kinds, fcarts or cormo- 
rants, gulls, herons, curlews, and fome others. The land birds 
are, eagles, hawks, ravens, crows, and hooded-crows, groufe, 
black cock, pigeons, ptarmigans, partridges, wood-cocks, 
plovers, fnipes, befides a variety of fmall birds. The beafts of 
prey are, foxes, fumarts, martins, wild cats. In our woods are 

deer 



of Morven. 369 

Ferries, csV.— There are two ftated ferries from this to 
the neighbouring pariihes, viz. one to the Mull from Fere- 
ntjh, and one to Ardnamurchan from Dorlin, at the mouth 
of Loch-Suineart. Another fuch is much wanted in the E. 
end oftheparifh, either at Kyle or Knock, where, though 
the boatmen ferry at times, one cannot force them out but 
when it fuits their humour and conveniency, and even then 
at whatever rates they pleale to exact. It is m.-chto be 
wifhed, that in thefe, and fuch ftated ferries, fome more at- 
tention was paid by thofe who have the management of the 
police, both to the conduct of the ferrymen, a»d the kind of 
boats they ought to keep.— Over and above the boats ufed 
on thefe ferries, there are no fewer than ioo fmali boat 
the pariah kept for the purpofe of fifhing, and carrying  
ware as manure to their lands, &amp;x. ; as alio 1 2 or j 
of a larger fize, well rigged, the property of the gentlei 
tackfmen, for transporting themfelves occasionally to 
neighbouring ifhndf, and for other purpefes of ufefulneT; a 
convenience. There are likewife boats of greater tonnag 
for following the herring fifhery at a diftance ; and one yefTe 
of about 20 tons burden, employed in the coafting trr.de. 
Though the keeping of fo many boats be evidently attended 

with 

deer and roes ' r and in our hills, mountain-hares: The whole 
parilh, both hill and ftrath, is much infefted with moles, and no 
means are ufed to deftroy them, though they are very hurtful 
to the ground. — It has been remarked of old, that rats would 
not live in Morven; this remark feems to be confirmed by feve- 
ral circumftances confiftent with the knowledge of moll of the 
inhabitants now alive. A few years ago, fome veffels were put 
alhore by ftrefs of weather in Loch-alin Bay ; by which cir- 
cumftance, a vaft number of rats nocked to the houfes on c;-.c : :. 
fide of the harbour. So numerous and mifchievous were tJ 
that it was apprehended they would fpread and overrun 
whole parilh; yet it happened, that, in a few years, they difap- 
peared, and now none are to be feen from one end of the pa- 
rilh to the other.

with much cxpence, yet it may be reckoned among the ad- 
vantages of the parifh, that it is indented and almoft fur- 
rounded with arms of the fea, many of which form fafe 
anchorage for lhipping in the worft weather. Loch-alin 
Bay, running in from the Sound of Mull in the S. E. part of 
the parifh, forms a fafe and cr-pacious harbour ; but it is 
rather narrow at the mouth, and not of eafy entrance, unlefs 
w ith eitl  r a favourable tide or fair wind. There is another 
late and commodious harbour at the mouth of Loch-Suineart, 
called Drumby ; it is, on the Morven fide, formed by a deep 
and clear inlet, betwixt the ifland Oronfay and the main- 
land. There arebefides numberlefs fine creeks for fmall 
boats ; and, along the coaft, fcarce a bay wherein a veffel of 
any tonnage may not pafs a tide.

EcckfwJHcal Slate.— The Duke of Argyle is patron and 
principal heritor ; there are, befides, 3 other heritors, all non- 
refidents. The incumbent came to the parifh in the year 
1775 ; at which time the living was only 58 1. us. with 5I. 
more in lieu of manfe and offices, and 5 1. to furnilh comr 
munion elements. An augmentation of 25 1. was obtained 
in the year 1787, which makes the living now (including ele- 
ments) equal to 88 1. 11 s. befides there is a glebe of 46 
acres -much improved by the incumbent. A good manfe 
■and office-houfes were obtained, and built in the year 1780, 
which coft the parifh 375 I. yet fuch is the nature of the cli- 
mate, and expofure of the fituation, that they already ftand 
in need of repairs, which the heritors have agreed to give 
next fummer. There are 2 churches, fo called from their 
outward appearance, but with refpect to decency of accom- 
modation, they might as properly be called fnades: In thefe 
the minifter alternately officiates. They are at 8 computed 
miles diftance. The dimenfions of each, no more than 40 by 
16 feet, within walls; without feats or bells. It is much to 
be regretted, that, fince the reformation, little or no attention 
has been paid to the feating of churches in this country ; and 
no lefs fo, as it is the prevailing opinion, that no pofitive law 
exifts to force unwilling heritors to fo necefTary and decent 
an accommodation. Though thefe are the only ftated places 
of worfhip, the incumbent, from motives of Chriflian compaf- 
Con to the wants of the people, whole dilhnce prevents their

attendance at either church, gives fermon a few Sundays in 
the year to two other places in the parifli. The manfe lies 
in a line betwixt the two churches, f from the one, and \ 
from the other. 

Schools — There is only 8 1. Sterling of a falary, by decreet 
of the commiffioners of fupply, for a parochial fchool, with- 
out any accommodation whatever. Of this fum, none' of the 
heritors, except the Duke of Argyle, have paid their propor. 
tions for fome years pafl: ; notwithftanding which, the minif- 
ter and a few gentlemen tackfmen have made a fhift, though 
under great difadvan rages, to keep it agoing hitherto, other- 
wife it, and of courfe the fociety's fchool, muft have dropt 
long ago. It is true the heritors might be compelled by law; 
but no fchoolmafter will prolecute, as the fchool is not worth 
contending for ; and the incumbent, or prefbytery, find fuch 
difficulties attending procefles of this kind, from this part of 
the world, as to have very little encouragement, in exhauft- 
ing their fmali livings on law-fuits, where the oppofition is fo 
powerful, and the iflue far from certain: The parochial 
fchool is attended by nearly 50 fchclars, 6 of whom are girls. 
There is alfo another fchool paid by the Society for propagat- 
ing Chriftian Knowledge, endowed with a falary of iol. be- 
fides a free houfe, free fuel, and holding for one cow : Yet 
fo little are people accuftomed to public burdens of this na* 
ture, that the greateft difficulties conftantly occur about fur- 
nifhing thefe accommodations, and keeping the dwelling and 
fchool-houfes in repair. There is however reafon to think 
thefe difficulties will foon be obviated, as the patron and prin- 
cipal ^heritor has begun to relieve his tenants and poor peo- 
ple from this fervitude, by giving 5 1. a year to fome of the 
fchools of this eftablifliment on his property, in lieu of pub- 
lic burdens. It is to be wifhed, both for the peace and hap.

pinefs of the fchoolmafters, and for pre'ferving a good undcr- 
ftanding betwixt them and the people, that this, or fome fuch 
converfion would become general. The Society alfo allows 
61. for a fpinning miftrefs ; the benefit of which would be 
more fenfibly felt, were there a method of providing the poor- 
er fort with a few wheels, and fome lint. Befides thefe pub- 
lic places of education, there are 7 or 8 gentlemen tackfmen 
who keep private teachers in their families, as they can have 
no accefs to the public fchools, on account of the diftanee. 

p 00r . — The poor are from 40 to 50 in number. The chief 
funds for their fupport, (beiides the charity of the people in 
their houfes,) are the weekly collection at the churches, and 
pecuniary mulcts impofed for immoralities ; both which a- 
mount, one year with another, to 8 I, The fefiion has late- 
ly got nearly 40 1. being the principal and interelt of 20 !. be- 
queathed in the year 1772 to the poor of Morven, by Mrs 
Jean Cameron of Mount Cameron ; to which, It is hoped, 
fomething more will be added, which may render their fitti- 
ation more comfortable, in time coming, than it has hitherto 
been. 

Character* &amp;c— The whole parifhiohers are of the eftab- 
lifhed church, excepting a few non-jurant epifcopalians. — Of 
old, the bulk of the people were inclined to that form of re- 
ligious worfhip, from political principles; but, for many years 
paft, thefe prejudices have been gradually falling off, and are 
now almofl: entirely forgot. Few prejudices indeed, of any 
kind, are prevalent among them. On the incumbent's coming 
to the parifh, they were very much prejudiced againft Inocula- 
tion : But, whether owing to his endeavours, or to the fuc- 
cefs of the practice among the more enlightened of their 
neighbours, during the laft vifit the country had from this 

Vol. X. M ax dangerous 



Slalijlical Account 



dangerous diforder, the generality not only agreed to inocu- 
lation, but many performed the operation on their own chil- 
dren, and thofe of their neighbours, with perfect fafety. 

The people are in general ihduftrious, had they a fubjecl: to 
work upon, or a proper (timulus. They are not addifted to 
any particular vice ; but this muft be underftood with fome 
exceptions, as muft always be expedted among fb large a body 
of people. In the year 1786, no fewer than 30 were expelled 
the parifh for theft, not by the fentence of a magiftrate, but 
by the united efforts of the better fort of the inhabitants. 
The good effeas of this expulfion have been fenfibly felt j and 
though a little gleaning is now thought neceffary, yet, hav- 
ing a flicriff court eftablifhed in the neighbourhood, the ne- 
ceftity of fuch violent exertions are in a great meafure ob- 
viated *. 

Mifcellatieous 

* The principal antiquity is the ruin of a caftle, at a farm cal- 
led ArdteriniJJ}, (poffibly the Iniflrtore of Ofiian,) on the Sound 
of Mull, where M'Donald of the Ifles relided, and held his 
courts and parliaments. Vide Abercrombie's life of James II. 
In different parts of the parifh, efpecially along the coaft of the 
Sound of Mull, on elevated places, there are feveral circular 
buildings, commonly called Druidical temples or cairns. They 
are generally formed of large whinflones, inclofing a fmall fpoc 
of ground, of different diameters, none of them exceeding 8 
yards. The language, principally fpoken in the parifh, is Gaelic. 
But of late year?, by the advantages derived from fchools, and 
the more general communication with the low country, the En- 
glifh language is more univerfally underftood throughout the 
parifh than formerly. Many names of places in this parifh are 
of unknown or uncertain derivations ; others plainly of Gaelic 
or Celtic original. Thus Inriifmore, is the great brae ; Port a 
baat, the boat creek ; Fhinary y Fingal's fhieling ; Dunien i Fin- 
gal's fort or hill ; Kemin, Fingal's fteps or flairs. Dunien is a 
curious round rock, of confiderable height, partly covered on the 
fides with a green fward, but of no eafy afcent. On the top is an 
area of about \ of an acre, which evidently appears to have 
been encircled with a wall ; very few veftiges of which now re- 
main, owing partly to the injuries of time, and partly to want of 

tafle

Mifcellaneous Olfervatiom. —The principal difadvantages, 
and the greateft hinderances to every fpecies of improvement, 
are the difficulties people generally have in fupplying them- 
felves with peats for fuel. The making of peats is at bell: 
but a tirefome and tedious operation ; often precarious, and 
attended with a heavy expence, befides the lofs of the fum- 
mer and autumnal months, which might be applied to much 
more lucrative and ufeful purpofes. Were the people able to 
purchafe coals, as there is water-carriage to the door of al- 
moft every farm-houfe, it would be a mighty advantage, and 
tend to render, their fituation much more comfortable and 
eafy. A modification of the fait laws alio would be necef- 
fary, in order to anfwer the benevolent intentions of the 

founders 

tafte in the tenants formerly occupying the farm, who pulled 
down the ilones, fordomellic purpofes, to fave the trouble of quar- 
rying. The den itfelf commands an extenilve view, and was 
well chofen for a place of defence againft a Hying party: It lies 
on the farm of Fi unary, and is now part of the glebf. There is 
a water running by the foot of the hill, of a romantic appear- 
ance, on account of its high banks and the number of its pools 
and cafcades. The floping braes, on each fide of this water, 
were formerly covered with a fine natural wood of oak and alh ; 
of which nothing now remains but a little bruihwood, a nui» 
fance rather than a beauty to the place. Kemin, is fteps in the 
form of a natural ftair, pretty regular, in a rock, towards the 
top of a hill called Btineiden, mentioned in an old poem afcrib- 
ed to Offian ; but whether this, or another of that name in Ire- 
land, be the hill therein referred to, it is not pretended to fay ; 
Drimtiin, the ridges ; u/ltu, the elbow ; Jlron, the nofe ; achaham, 
the field of cairns; argiwJJ), the fhieling of good bedding for 
cattle, names of places very defcriptive of their appearance or 
properties. The principal place of worAiip, and where the oldeft 
church Hands, is called Cill-collwn kill, or cell of the famous Col- 
lumbus of Jona. The other place of worfhip is called KiLwuk, 
or cell of Winifred. Though the church is now removed to a 
little diltance from it, at each of thefe there is a church-yard, 
or burying ground, but now without any fence, though ancient- 
ly their precincls were dillinaiy marked, a.nd confidered as folic* 
tuaries,

founders of fifhing villages. Another principal difadvantagc 
is the difficulty and uncertainty of communication by water 
with the low country. Though a veffel, called a packet, runs 
at times between the Clyde and the Sound of Mull, it has 
been only fet agoing and continued by private adventurers for 
their own intereft, and is fubjecied to no rules calculated for 
the public good ; no dependance can be had either on the 
time of its failing, or the rate of freight. As the bufinefs of 
the country, in its prefent unimproved. fiate, cannot afford fuf- 
f.cient employment, were a fmall bounty allowed by govern- 
ment to keep one or two fuch veffels conftantly going, and 
rates of freight fo fixed that there might be neither danger 
of impofition, nor fear of tlifappointment, the advantages to 
thefe parts, would be greater than can well be eftimated. In- 
crcafe of bufinefs would, in time, fuperfede the neceffity of a 
bounty. 

At the head of Loch Alin Bay, there is a very flattering 
appearance of coal; to work which, a feeble attempt has 
been made, and a few tons of good quality found ; but, not 
being profecuted with vigour, it has not fucceeded. This is 
the more to be regretted, as the mine lies clofe by the fhore 
of this good and commodious harbour. Around the whole 
of this loch freeftone and limeftone, of excellent qualities, are 
found in great abundance. Some years ago an attempt was 
made to come at a lead mine on a farm called Lurgbhuidh, 
but with little fuccefs ; though fome are of opinion thatthe 
appearances delerved more attention. At the farm of Ardint- 
Kbet. there is a well, into which if green leather be thrown 
at night, it will be found' perfectly black in the morning.

By the Reverend Mr TohnPaton,</head> 

<p>Extent, Soil, &amp;c. 

LASWADE is divided nearly into two equal parts by 
the river North Efk. , Its figure is irregular, being 8 
miles in length, and varying from 2 to 4 miles in breadth. 
In furface, foil, and climate, this parifh is extremely various ; 
on the N. it includes the eaftern extremity of the Pentland 
Hills, which is covered partly with heath, and partly with fine, 
green pafture ; on the S. there is an extenfive track of moor 
and wet mofs ; about 1 000 acres are covered with natural 
and planted timber, viz. oak, afh, elm, Scotch fir, fpruce, and 
larix-, the reft, which is by far the greateft. part of the parifh, 
is arable land. The foil is extremely various in its quality ; 
in general, however, it is good, and produces excellent crops 
of all the common grains. The lands of Pendriech in this pa- 
rifh, in particular, ufed to be remarkable for producing peafe 
of fo fuperior a quality that they were fold at 2 s. or 3 s. per 
boll higher than any in the country. 

The climate is as various as the foil, in fo much, that, from 
the lower to the higher extremities, the diftance of 2 miles 
makes a difference of 10 or 12 days in ripening the produce

improving every year by the influence of" large and thriving 
plantations. 

Agriculture. — There are 50 ploughs in the parifh, moftly 
ef Small's con (Inaction, and drawn by 2 horfes, but fome far- 
mers ftill prefer the Scotch plough. The following is the 
rotation of crops molt frequently obferved. Wheat is fown 
after potatoes, or fummer fallow •, when the wheat is after po- 
tatoes, and on light fand, it is fown down with grafs feeds; 
when after fummer fallow, it is fucceeded by a crop of peafe 
or beans, then oats or barley with grafs feeds ; after lying a 
year or two in grafs, the land is broken up and fown with 
oats. About a fixth part of the arable ground in the parifh 
is kept in pafture, for which graziers pay a high rent. 

Gardening is carried on here to a confiderable extent ; and 
the attention of the gardener is chiefly directed to the culti- 
vation of ftrawberries, than which he has not a furer or 
more profitable crop. They depend lefs upon the feafon than 
other fruits ; they never, indeed, fail altogether, which in this 
country is often the cafe with the other productions of the 
garden and, when properly cultivated, this fruit will yield at 
an average 18I. from an acre. It maybe obferved, that it 
was in this parifh that ftrawberries were firft raifed in any 
quantities for the public market. 

The farmers, in general, breed their own horfes, which are 
of a large fize, and valued at from 1 8 1. to 25 1. They breed 
alfo their own cows, moftly of the common Scotch kind, and 
which will fell for from 5 1. to iol. Many gentlemen have 
cows of the Englilh, Dutch, and Guernfey breed. 

Markets, Rent, &amp;c. — There is a butcher market in the pa- 
rift), where the prices are nearly the fame as in Edinburgh ; 

this 



of La/wade* 



this is the cafe with all other kinds of provifions. — The valu- 
ed rent of this parifh is 7436 1. 6 s. 8 d. Scotch, and its real 
rent may be from 5000 1. to 6000 1. Tile higheft price gi- 
ven for land is 2 I. per acre. 

Manufactures are in a thriving ftate, there being two ex- 
tenfive bleachfields, 1 barley, and 2 meal mills, and 4 paper 
mills, belides a fifth lately erected. It is about 50 years fince 
the firft paper mill was built in this parilh ; and, within thefe 
30 years, the number of people employed in this manufac- 
ture has increafed from 30 or 40 to about 260 : Thefe, with, 
the tradefmen and labourers occafionaliy employed, receive 
and circulate in the parifli above 3000 1. annually, befides a 
confiderable fum given for coal. The rags confumed weigh, 
above 300 tons ; and the duties paid to the revenue a- 
mount to above 1 800 1. yearly. Mr Simpfon, proprietor of 
2 of the mills in this parilh, has the merit of being the firft 
paper manufacturer in this country who has applied the li- 
quor recommended by Berthollet in his new method of bleach- 
ing to the purpofe of whitening rags. He has erected an ap- 
paratus for preparing this liquor, which, by the addition of 
fome new ingredients, he makes without its ofFenfive fmell, 
and ufes it in the common paper engine, (as has been done 
for fome time in Ireland,) without retarding the operation, 
or doing any injury to the fteel. This improvement, it is 
thought, will add much to the quality and beauty of the pa- 
per. He has alfo the merit of bringing into ufe in this coun- 
try, the drying of paper by means of flues on the principle 
of hot houfes, which muft contribute much to forward this 
branch of the bufinefs during the winter feafon. Some ex- 
periments are juft now making at his mill, and with great 
hopes of fuccefs, for heating the vats on a new plan, which 
will have many advantages over the prefent method, parti- 
cularly in point of cleanlinefs, and faving of coal. 

Minerals,

Stailflical Account 



Minerals. — The minerals come under the general denomi- 
nation of coal metals, viz. fandftone, (or freeftone.) clays of 
great variety, having different names according to their co- 
lour and degree of induration, a very great number of dif- 
tincl: feams of coal, and three beds of limeftone. Thefe ex- 
tend over the whole of the parilh ; nor has there as yet been 
difcovered within its bounds any granite or bafaltes (here term- 
ed whinftone,) in any folid mafs, or even contained in any 
fracture, (or dike as it is called) excepting in a fmall corner 

on the eaft end of the ridge of Pentland Hills The rolling 

ftones, found occafionally in the channel of the river, are 
brought down in floods from the hills, lying without the 
bounds of the parilh. 

On the north weft fide of the river North Elk, the metals 
ftand much on edge, forming in fome places an angle of 
above 65 degrees with the horizon ; and in other places 
(though not in this parilh) Handing perfectly perpendicular, 
for which reafon the coals in this difiricT: are diftinguiChed 
by the name of the edge cosls. They confift of different 
feams, fmall and great, almoft innumerable ; but in the baro- 
ny of Loanhead, about the middle of their courfe through 
the parilh, they amount to twenty-five in number, of work- 
able feams from two to ten feet in thicknefs. By a crofs 
level mine from the river, they are wrought from the grals 
downwards to the depth of 90 yards perpendicular.-- -Thefc 
edge feams, from the fea fide in the lands of Duddingfton in 
the line of their direction (or ftreak,) extend in a body to- 
wards Linton in Tweeddale, about 12 or 13 miles, of which 
the part in this parilh is about four miles in length. 

On the fouth eaft fide of the river the metals have fo fmall 
a dip or declination, that the coal there, of which feven or 
eight feams have already been difcovered, has got the name 
©f the flat broad coals. Their dip is about one in feven or 

eight 



of Lajivade. 



eight Teams have already been difcovered, has got the name 
of the flat broad coals; their dip is about one in feven or eight ; 
their extent within the parifh from S. W. to N. E. from 
7 to 8 miles in length. 

The whole of thefe metals within the parifii, and on botli 
fides of the river, dip to the S. E. but towards the S. E. 
boundary, in crofiing a certain fuppoied line, extending up 
the country from the fea fide near Muffelburgh, the feverai 
firata are known to take a rife towards both fides ; and this 
general line on the face of the country, correfponding with 
the polition of the firata below, has formed what may be cal- 
led a trough. That fome of the uppermoft learns of coal, 
which are known to have a rife towards both fides, may be 
preferved entire and unbroken, in their paflage through this 
trough, is not to be doubted; neither is it to be doubted, that 
lome of the edge coals, after finking on the N. do rile again 
on the S. fide of this trough, but that they keep entire and 
unbroken in their paflage below this trough is held to be, 
improbable. 

The coal is diftinguimed by the terms of fplint and rough 
only, and pofleffes little of the caking quality of the Newcaf- 
tie coal. The damps are of the mephitic kind, which extin- 
guifhes a candle. Inflammable air was never feen in our pits. 
It is not known at what time thefe coals were firft begun to- 
be taken out, but, in the lands of Pendrich, it muft have been, 
above 200 years ago. 

The annual produce has fluctuated much ; at an average, 
it may he ftated at 30,000 tons, valued, at the pit-head, 
between 6000 1. and 7 oco 1. The price, when delivered in 
Edinburgh, will amount, including carriage, to 1 2,000 1. or 
M,ocol. There are from 90 to 100 colliers, (pickmen). 
Women are ftill employed as bearers below ground j their 
number may be from 130 to 150.

mer to clear his land of rubbifh, which had remained after 
an old pit had been filled up, had it gathered together, and 
burnt upon the top of the pit. Two or three years thereafter, 
it was dilcovered that the fire had been continued down the 
pit, through the coal rubbilh with which it had been filled 
up, and was found burning into the wafres or excavations 
below. Many endeavours have been made to have it extin- 
guifhed, but hitherto (it is feared) without effect, for neither 
can air be perfectly excluded, nor can the places on fire bz 
any how laid under water. 

Population. — In 1 79 1, this parifh contained rather more 
than 3000 inhabitants. The return to Dr Webfter, in ^755, 
was 2190 fouls. For this increafe the following reafons may 
be affigned, viz. ift, Manufactures have greatly increafed, 
particularly that of paper. 2d, Improvements of ever/ kind 
have been carried on to a great extent, which has occafioned 
a greater demand for labourers. 3d, Some of the proprietors 
have been in the ufe of feuing ground for building upon, 
which, added to the plenty of coal in the parifh, has induced 
ftrangers to fettle in it. 

Poor —In fo large and populous a parifh, the number of 
poor muft of courfe be confiderable. There are, accordingly, 
•about 50 perfons, who receive a ftated allowance of from 2 s. 
to 4 s. per month, befides others who are occafionally fupplied. 
The collections at the church doors,, which amount to up. 
wards of 30 1. per annum; the dues arifing from mort-cloths, 
marriages, and fines, which may be eftimated at 20 1. to- 
aether with the intereft of a capital ftock of 3 33 U 6* 8 d. 
have, till lately, been fufficient to anfwer the demands. But 
theft funds being now inadequate to the expenditure, the he- 
ritors make up this deficiency by a voluntary contribution. 
This mode they wifely prefer to an affeffinent, a meafure 



of Lafiuade. 



which, ought always to be avoided, if poflible, as it never fails 
to increafe the number of claimants. There is a laudable fpi- 
rit in the common people of this country, which keeps them 
from applying for aid out of the poors funds, fo long as. they 
can do any thing for themfelves. This arifes from the ap- 
prehenfion, that thefe funds depend for their fupply folely 
on the voluntary contributions at the church doors. Where- 
as, no fooner do they find that there is a legal eftablifhment 
in their favour, than they apply for aid without referve, and 
before they ftand in need of it *. 

Ecclefinjllcal State and School. — Sir John Clerk of Penny- 
cuick is patron. The fiipend confifts of 70 1. 1 6 s. 5^. d. Ster- 
ling, 44 bolls 2 lippies of oats, and 26 bolls, 1 firlot, 2 iip- 
pies of barley. The glebe contains upwards of 5 acres ara- 
ble, befides pafture. The rnanfe, one of the belt in the 
country, was built in 1789, and coft 500 1. If the fum ex- 
pended in building the manfe is a proof of the liberality of 
the heritors, they deferve no lefs credit from the church 
juft now erecting, which, in point of accommodation, and 
magnificence of ftrueture, will far exceed any modern coun- 
try church in Scotland. The number of difTenters of all de- 
nominations is confiderable. The Cameronians and Burgher 
feceders have each of them a meeting-houfe within the pa-* 

riih. 

* This parifh is connected with feveral charitable focieties. 
The nature of thefe affociations is this; the paper makers, car- 
ters, and colliers, belonging to different adjacent parifhes, have 
a fund belonging to each profeffion. Every perfon, who choofes 
to enter, pays fo much quarterly into this common flock, and, 
in return, is entitled to a weekly allowance when dilabled from 
working, by ficknefs or any accident. Thefe focieties are ufeful 
not only for the purpofes of charity, but alfo for preferving good 
morals among their members, fince it is one of their eftablilhed 
rules, that no perfon, who lies under the imputation of any 
crime, can receive aid from their fund.

F'lfli. There is a thriving fchool in the village of LafwacTe, 
where Englifh, Latin, writing, arithmetic, and mathema- 
tics are taught with fuccefs. The fchoolmafters falary and 
fees as feffion clerk, &amp;c. amount to 16I. and the profits of 
his fchool to about 20 1. per milium. He has a good houfe, 
which enables him to keep boarders. 

Curlofities and Antiquities. — The North Elk has a molt beau- 
tiful run for feveral miles within this parifh. On its banks 
are to be feen many of thofe favoured fpots, which nature 
and art have combined to adorn to an uncommon degree. 
The winding courfo- of the river, appearing often to lofe rtfelf 
among the rocks ; its banks, which are remarkably bold and 
finely wooded ; the huge pieces of rock feen projecting at pro- 
per intervals from among the trees, form an aflemblage of 
the moft romantic and picturefque fcenes that are to be met 
with in the fouthern parts of Scotland. In the midft of this 
beautiful fcenery, is fituated the houfe of Hawthornden, re- 
markable not only for its having belonged to Drummond the 
poet and hiftorian, but alfo for the caves under it. There 
are various conjectures as to the original intention of thefe 
fubterraneous cavities. Dr Stukeley has given credit to a fa- 
bulous tradition, that they were a ltrong hold of the Piclifii 
kings*, and, accordingly, one cave is called the Kings Gallery, 
another, the Kings Bed Chamber, and a third, the Guard Room. 
.Setting afide this groundlefs tradition, the moft probable opi- 
nion is, that they were intended as places of refuge during 
the deftruclive wars that fubfifted long between the Englifh and 
Pitts, or Englifh and Scotch. Detached from the principal 
caves there is a fmaller one, called the Cyprefs Grove, where 
Drummond is faid to have compofed many of his poems. It 
was in thefe caverns that the famous Sir Alexander Ramfay, 
one of the anceftors of the Dalhoufie family, and who per- 
formed 



of Lafwadc, 



formed fuch exploits of valour during the conteft for the 
crown between Bruce and Baliol, ufed to conceal himfelf. 
Here, he was reforted to by the young warriors of his day, 
who confidered it as a neceffary piece of military education to 
have been of his band ; and from thence he Tallied forth as 
occafion prefented itfelf *, and attacked the Englilh, then in 
poffeffion of Edinburghf.

f About half a mile above Hawthornden ftand the vener- 
able ruins of Roflin. A particular defcription of thefe ruins 
would be fuperfiuous here, as they are univerfally known, and 
drawings of them are every where to be feen. They have fuf- 
fered much within theje 40 years. It is uncertain when this 
caftle was built ; moft probably it was in the beginning of the 12th 
century, when William de Sanclo Clere, fon to Waldernus de 
St Clere, who came over with William the Conqueror, obtain- 
ed from Malcolm Canmore a grant of the barony of Roflin. 
No mention is made of it in hiitory, till the reign of James II» 
when we read of Sir William Hamilton being confined there- 
in, for engaging in the rebellion which Earl Douglas had rail- 
ed againft that monarch. In 1554, it was burnt by the army 
of Henry VIII. along with Leith and Craigmillar. This caftle 
was the ancient feat of the St Clere's, a family of great note ia 
this country. They had very extenfive pofleffions, and many 
titles ; being Earls of Caithnefs, and Orkney, Dukes of Olden- 
burgh, &amp;c. and they were for many generations patrons and 
Grand Matters of mafonry in Scotland. This honour was con- 
ferred upon them by James II. and continued in their family 
till lately. 

On the hill immediately above the caftle, is the chapel of Rof- 
lin, founded by William Earl of Caithnefs and Orkney, for a 
provoft, 6 prebendaries, and 2 tinging boys. The founder en- 
dowed it with the church-lands of Pentland, 4 acres of land near 
that town, the kyps .and 8 ibums of grafs near to Pentland. 
This chapel is a beautiful piece of Gothic architecture; and, not- 
withstanding fome damage it fuftained by a mob in 1688, is ftill 
very entire. It is 68 feet in length, 34 in breadth, and 40 ia 
height : The roof is arched, and fupported by 2 rows of pillars. 
It is highly ornamented with curious workmanfhip. The pre- 
fent building is only the choir of a large collegiate chinch, that 

was 



Stati/lical Account 



Near the houfc of Mavifbank, built by the late Sir Joh* 
Clerk, is a mount of earth of confiderable height, which is 

fuppofed 

was intended to have been built. Within the chapel is a vault, 
the burying place of the family of Roflin, the foil of which 
is fo dry that bodies have been found entire 80 years after 
their interment. They were formerly buried in armour, and 
without a coffin. « The late Roflin,' fays father Hay, in his 
M. S. Memoirs, « was the firfl that was buried in a coffin, com 
trary to the fentiments of James VII. who was then in Scot- 
land ;' and he adds, ' that the great expence my mother was at 
in burying her hufband occafioned the fumptuary acls that 
were made in the next parliament.' The village of Roflin was 
a place of confiderable confequence. James II. ere&amp;ed it into 
burgh of barony at Stirling in 1456, with a weekly market, and 
a yearly fair. 

Near to Roflin is the fcene of a battle that was fought be- 
twixt the Englilh and Scotch, on the 24th February 1303. The 
Englifh and Scotch writers differ much in their accounts of this 
action : Of which we have from our own hiflorians the fol- 
lowing particulars. During a truce, Ralf Confrey, treafurer to 
Edward I. invaded Scotland at the head of 30000 men, well 
armed, and moftly mounted on ' horfeback. With a view to 
plunder, he divided his forces into three bodies; and, having 
reached the neighbourhood of Roflin, encamped them in as 
many different Rations. On hearing of this invafion, Sir Sy- 
mon Frazer and Sir John Cuming, the Scotch generals, drew 
together fuch an army as they could mufter in hafle, amount- 
ing to 8000, or at molt to 10,000 men. With thefe they marched 
from Biggar ; and fell unexpectedly on the firft divifion of the ene- 
my, whom they totally routed, and drove thole who efcaped 
back on the fecond camp. Here, on the alarm being given, 
the Englifli took to their arms, and fallied forth on the Scots, 
while they were dividing the fpoil. The conflict was again re- 
newed; and the Scotch were a fecond time victorious. Scarce 
had they begun to refrefli themfelves, after this bloody engage- 
ment, when a third army appeared in view. It is not to be 
wondered at that their courage began now to fail them, already 
faint and fatigued with the fervice they had gone through; and 
accordingly it was with difficulty that their commanders could 
prevail on them to ftand their ground. Animated, however, 
by their harangues and the hope of plunder, they, a third time, 
and on the fame day, received and routed a frefli body of troops, 
and fuperior in number to themfelves. This engagement was 
much fpoker. of at the time both at home and abroad.

form, and begirt with ramparts, now cut into terraces. Here 
feveral articles of brafs, and of ancient form, ha've been found, 
fuch as weapons, bridle bits, chirurgical inftruments, ftili, 
fibulae, Sec, Some of thefe being Roman, the reft have been 
confidered as fuch alfo ; they are ftill to be feen at Penny- 
cuick., In a neighbouring farm is a tumulus, where feveral 
urns, filled with burnt bones, have been dug up. Thefe cir- 
cumftances led Sir John Cleric, who was well acquainted 
with the antiquities of this country, to fuppole that this muft 
have been a Roman ftation. And, accordingly, the late Gene- 
ral Roy has pointed it out in his maps, as the place where 
the Romans paired the North Elk, in their way from the 
South to Cramond. 

Miscellaneous Obfervations. — Along the banks of the river is 
a conftant fucceffion of gentleman's feats, many of them large 
and excellent houfes. Melville caftie in particular, the feat 
of Mr Dundas, one of his Majeity's principal Secretaries of 
State, is a noble building, and luited to the exalted ftation of 
its owner. It was built a iew years ago, on the fcite of the 
old houfe of that name, which, tradition fays, belonged to 
David Rizzio, and was occafionally inhabited by Queen Mary. 
This tradition may /have taken its rife from a circumftsnce 
mentioned by Buchanan, that Mary, wilhing to give her fa- 
vourite an eftablifliment in the country, and a feat in the Con- 
vention, caft hef eyes firft of all on the lands of Melville, 
and applied in the moft earned: manner to the proprietor to 
give them up. W the hiftorian adds, that fhe could not 
prevail on him, and that (he was much offended at the refufal. 

This parifh has the honour of having given birth to Wil- 
liam Drummond, author of the hiftory of the 5 firft James's, 
and other works of merit in profe and verfe. He was born 

at 



Stati/lical Account 



at Havvthornden on the 13th of February 1585. The parti- 
culars of his life are fo well known, that it is unneceffary to 
enter into a detail of them in this place. His works, confider- 
ing the period when they were compofed, do honour to him- 
felf and his country : They difcover a mind highly cultivated, 
and of a refined and elegant caft. His company was much 
courted by his cotemporaries. Ben Johnfon came from Lon- 
don on foot, on purpofe to pafs fome weeks with him at Haw- 
thornden, and fome fragments of their converfations are to 
be found in his works* He was zealoufly attached to the 
caufe of Charles I. and it is faid, that the unhappy fate of 
that monarch haftened on his own death, which happened on 
the 4th of December 1649. He was buried in his family 
aile in the church of Lafwade.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3997506">ANCRUM</name>. 

(Prejbytery of Jedburgh. — Synod of Merfe and Ti» 
motdale. — County of Roxburgh. J 

By the Reverend Thom as Somerville, D. D. Minijier 

of Jedburgh.</head> 



<p>Extent and Name. 

THE parifh of Ancrum, fituated nearly in the center of 
the county of Roxburgh, ftretches 5 miles in length 
upon the N. fide of the river Tiviot, which divides it from 
the parifhes of Jedburgh and Bedrule. The extreme length 
of this diftricl is not lefs than 6 miles, and its breadth does 
not exceed 4. — The name of the village, AIncromb, as it is 
written in ancient records *, fignifies, as I have been inform- 
ed, in the Gaelic, crook upon river; and is exactly defcrip- 
tive of its fituation on the fouth fide of Ale, where the river 
runs in a curve or crooked direction, and the adjacent banks, 
to which the village approaches, exhibit the fide of an ellip- 
fis. The parifh of Langnewton was annexed to that of An- 
trum in the end of the laft century, and forms the N. W. 
and part of the N. fide of the parifh, as now defcribed. The 
river Ale, ifiuing from the loch of that name in the county 
of Selkirk, takes its courfe through this parifli from W. to 
E. feparating, as I conjecture, the old parifh of Langnewton ;

and difcharges itfclf into Tiviot at the diftance of half a mile 
below the village, and a quarter of a mile above Ancrum 
Bridge on the great road to Jedburgh. This river abounds 
with excellent trout, and affords better fport to the fifhers 
than any other in this country. 

Soil, Agriculture, &amp;c — The foil, in the lower grounds of 
the parifh upon the fide of Tiviot, is rich, confifting of a 
mixture of fand and clay, and, in fome places, particularly 
near the village, of a loam. In every feafon it produces good 
crops of wheat, barley, potatoes, turnips, and fown grafs. 
On the higher ground or ridge, which pervades the parifh 
from E. to W. and, on the declivities expofed to the N. the 
furface is a heath, wet, partially ftony, covering a bottom of 
cold clay ; but the fiat ground, on both the Ancrum and 
Langnewton fide of Ale, is naturally rich, though, being of a 
deep and ftiff clay, it is not Co eafily ploughed, nor are the 
returns fo certain, as in the Tiviot haughs or holmes. 

There was formerly a confiderable extent of wcod in this 
parifh; but none of long ftanding remains, except upon the 
banks of the Ale near the village of Ancrum, and that which 
is in the environs of Ancrum-houfe, on the oppofite fide of 
the river. There are feveral young plantations of fir and 
white wood belonging to Sir John Scott, Admiral Elliot, &amp;c. 
and fome, comprehending not lefs than 100 acres, upon the 
eftate of Sir George Douglas, in the barony of Langnewton. 
Thefe are all thriving ; and already begin to embellifh the 
afpect of the country, which was formerly bleak and defolate. 

The fituation of Ancrum-houfe, where, according to tra- 
dition, the village formerly flood, is piclurefque and attrac- 
tive. The furrounding fields are beautifully diverfified both 
in figure and furface. Spots of verdant .lawn, fometimes le- 
vel and fometimes Hoping, craggy knolls, fcattered trees, and 

fteep 



of Ancrunu 



fteep banks upon the verge of the river, in fome places nak- 
ed and of broken furface, and in others clothed with wood, 
exhibit a rare afTemblage of romantic objects. The trees fur- 
rounding Ancrum- houfe deferve to be particularly diftin- 
guifhed in a ftatiftical defcription, being, I believe, the oldeft 
and moft beautiful in this country. They confift of oaks, 
beech, elms, planes, and limes of a large fize and bufhy top. 
The profpect from the houfe down the vale of Tiviot, and 
bounded by the lofty mountains of Cheviot, is grand and ex- 
tensive. 

Eccleftaflical State, — Sir John Scott is patron of the 
united parifhes, and titular of Ancrum. The emoluments 
of the minifter of Ancrum may be moderately ftated at the 
value of 150I. per annum. He enjoys no part of the ftipend 
paid to the minifter of Langnewton before its annexation. 
The church is in good repair. The heritors have voluntari- 
ly augmented the falary of the fchoolmaller ; and built a 
fchoolhoufe larger and more commodious than in any other 
country parifh in this prefbytery. 

The poor are maintained by a quarterly afleflmcnt propor- 
tioned to the valued rent. The weekly collections in this 
parifh are, I believe, difpofed of by the kirk-ieflion for intc~

the collector for the poor, as is the cafe in other parifhes. 
The laft quarterly afleflinent was at the rate of 3 s. 6 d. per

The return to Dr Webfter in 1755 was 1066 fouls. 

From the report of the grave-digger in Ancrum, who 
keeps an exact lift of all the funerals, it appears that, during 
the laft eight years he has been in that office, they amount 
precifely to 200 ; but this relates only to the old parifh of 
Ancrum. There is a church-yard in Langnewton where the 
inhabitants of that diftrift are buried, and fome in both the 
diftri£ts of Ancrum and Langnewton are buried in neigh- 
bouring parifhes. — There are many Seceders adhering to the 
Burgher, Antiburgher, and Relief congregations, in Jed- 
burgh ; but the generality of the people continue in the efta- 
blifhment. 

Heritors^ Value of Land, Improvements , &amp;c. — The Duke of 
Roxburgh, Sir John Scott, Sir George Douglas, Admiral 
Elliot, Mr Carre of Cavers, Major Bennet of Sandhill, Mr 
Ogilvie of Chefters, and Mifs Stewarts, are confiderable he- 
ritors. There are fever al fmall heritors, and fome feuers in 
the village of Ancrum, who pofTefs farms of a few acres con- 
tiguous to their own property •, but the greateft part of the 
land in this parifh is let in large farms, though not fo large 
as in the neighbourhood. The moft confiderable part of the

farms in this parifh is ploughed, though a few cattle and 
fheep are alfo kept on them. A great proportion of the 
land is inclofed, partly with dry ftone dikes, but m ftly with 
ditch and hedge ; and fome cattle and fheep are fattei.cd 
upon turnips and grafs for the market. Some of the lar^eit 
and heft cultivated farms in this parifh are let at 1 1. per a,e, 
and grafs inclofures, for the fummer only, have been let at 
the rate of two guineas per acre j in the open muirl.uid 
ground, the rent cannot be eftimated at more than 4 s. or 5 s. 
per acre. The valued rent of the united parifhes of Ancium 
and Langnewton amounts to 1 2,332 1. 2 s. Scotch, and the 
real rent exceeds 4000 1. Sterling. 

Minerals, fcsV.— -There are feveral freeftone quarries in this 
parifh. The ftone is ealily wrought and of a durable quali- 
ty, as appears from its entire ftate in fome of the oldeft 
buildings, bhell marl has been found in different moffes, 
and particularly on the eftate of Belches, belonging to Mr 
Carre of Cavers, where it has been ufed, and has contribut- 
ed to the improvement of the neighbouring farms. There 
are two bridges over the river Ale in this parifh ; one at the 
church, which is narrow, and feems to have been intended 
principally for the convenience of the parifhioners on the 
north fide of the river j the other was eretted about twenty 
years ago a little below the village ; and has greatly contri- 
buted not only to the accommodation of the immediate 
neighbourhood, but to that of the parifhes weft of Ancrum, 
by rendering their communication with Jedburgh, Kelio, and 
the Merfe, at all times certain and fafe.— There is a hntmill, 
built fome years ago by Sir John Scott, in the neighbourhood 
of Ancrum ; and, as there is not another within many miles, 
it meets with good encouragement, and it is to be hoped will 
promote the culture of an article which has hitherto been

lefs attended to in this country than in other parts of Scot- 
land *. 

There 

* The Roman road from York to the Frith of Forth, after 
pafiing through the north eaft part of the parifh of Jedburgh, 
cuts a fmall part of the north corner of Ancrum. Upon the 
top and declivity of the hill eaftward, on the border of Maxton 
parifh, veftiges of a Roman camp may ftill be traced. The 
ridge in the parifh of Ancrum, over which the prefent road to 
Edinburgh paffes, is at the diflance of about a quarter or half a 
mile weft of the line of the Roman road. It is called Liliard's 
Edge, from a lady of that name, who, upon an invalion of the 
Englifh during the regency of the Earl of Arran, fought with 
mafculine bravery, and fell under many wounds upon this fpot, 
confecrated to her memory. As the Englilh, commanded by 
Lord Rivers, were repulfed, though their numbers were fupe- 
rior, courtefy mud incline us to fuppofe, that the high fp'nited 
and animating example of our Scottifh Amazon chiefly contri- 
buted to the glory and triumph of the day. 

The moil venerable fragment of antiquity in the parifh is the 
Maltan wall or walls, upon a rifmg ground at the bottom of the 
village of Ancrum, clofe to the fide of the river, where it turns 
its courfe towards the S. E. Thefe walls were ftrongly built 
of ftone and lime in the figure of a parallelogram, and, amend- 
ing on one fide from the plain adjacent to the river, were con- 
fiderably higher than the fummit of the hill which they inclofe; 
but are now levelled with its furface, and a fmall part of them 
remain. Vaults or fubterraneous arches have been difcovered 
in the neighbouring ground, and underneath the area inclofed 
by the building. Human bones are Mill found by perfons 
ploughing or digging in the plain at the fide of the river, which 
is an evidence of its having been formerly occupied as burying- 
ground. The name, which thefe walls ftill retain, gives the co- 
lour of authenticity to a tradition generally received in this 
part of the country, that the building, and furrounding fields, 
had been vetted in the Knights of Malta, or Knights Hofpi- 
tallers of St. John of Jerufalem, who, upon account of their 
fplendid atchievements and meritorious fervices in the holy 
wars, had acquired property even in the moft remote kingdoms 
of Chriftendom. On the banks of the Ale, below the Houfe of 
Ancrum, there were feveral caves or recefTes, and not lefs than 
fifteen n;ay be ftill pointed out In fome of them there are al- 
fo veftiges of chimneys or fire places, and holes for the pafTage 
of fmoke from the back part of the cave to the outfidc of the 



of Ancrum* 129 5 

There were formerly many malt-kilns in the village of 
Ancrum. Old people fpecify the number of eighteen or 
twenty having been in conftant occupation in the days of 
their fathers; an evidence of the extent of the contraband 
trade carried on by the Scottilh borderers previous to the 



union. 



Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The people, in general, are in- 
duftrious, healthy, and robuft; and there have been inftances 
of extraordinary longevity in this as well as in neighbouring 
pariflies, though it is remarkable that no perfon now living 
in it exceeds the age of feventy five. Mr Cranftoun, the laft 
incumbent but one, attained to the age of eighty four, dur- 
ing fifty feven years of which period, he had been minifter 
of the parifh j and he and his fon were the only Prefbyte- 
rian incumbents in Ancrum from the Revolution till January 
1 790, a fact that probably has not a parallel in any other 
part of Scotland. The late Mr Cranftoun, during the firft 
fifty years of his miniftry, had never been rendered incapable 
of performing his duty by indifpofition. Though, for the 
laft feven years of his life, from the increafing infirmities of 
age, he found it convenient to accept of the occafional afixf- 
tance of his brethern; and difcontinued preaching altogether 
the two laft, being regularly fupplied by an afllftant at his 
own expence, yet his health was found, and his mental facul- 
ties entire and vigorous. A comprehenfive underftanding, 

and 

bank. From thefe appearances, it is natural to conclude, that, 
though thefe caves, fo frequently found on the banks of rivers 
in border counties, were originally intended for places of con- 
cealment and fhelter, yet, after the happy event which put an 
end to interior violence and depredation, they were probably 
aflumed by the poorer claffes for places of habitation, and im- 
proved by fuch farther accommodations as the rude or fimple 
tafte of the times required.

and a penetrating difcernmcnt of characters, improved by a 
wide compafs of obfervation *, great facility and force of ex- 

preffion, 

* Reflea ing upon the information and pleafure derived from 
itiy intercourfe with Mr Cranftoun, 1 embrace this opportunity 
of recommending to young perfons, who are inquifitive for 
knowledge, to reverence the hoary head, to court the company 
and converfation of thofe whofe wifdom has been enriched and 
dignified by the experience of multiplied years. If this advice 
were more ftriclly attended to, interefting anecdotes, and valu- 
able information, which elude the notice of general hiflory, 
while they are recent and familiar, would often be conveyed by 
authentic tradition ; and acquiring importance from the rapid and 
ftrange viciffitudes they exhibit, as well as from their contraftand 
connexion with modern events and manners, would, at length, 
enter into record, and be refcued from the gulph of oblivion. 
By accumulating a ftore of facts, our views of paft hiftory 
would become more correct and enlarged; and the fpeculations 
of the philofopher and politician, relative to future events, and 
to meafures affecting the interefts of pofterity, would be found- 
ed upon the moft folid bafis. 

The plan of this ftatiftical hiftory feems well calculated to 
fupply what has hitherto been a dejideratum in literature; and, in 
the eftimation of future generations, the locality and minutenefs 
of the circumftances which it contains, will conftitute not the 
fmalleft part of its intereft and utility. Enlightened by fuch 
inftruction, we are enabled to inveftigate the fources of preju- 
dices and cuftoms, the elements of characters and manners, and 
the caufes of events, of which, otherwife, we are utterly at a Iofs 
to give any explanation or account. I illuftrate this obferva- 
tion by a fact ftriclly pertinent to my prefent argument. There 
are few, perhaps none in this parifh, who have heard of the per- 
fection of Mr Livingfton the minifter of Ancrum after the Re- 
ftoration. He was univerfally refpected in the church for his 
piety and for his popular talents as a preacher, and dearly be- 
loved by his flock. He was banifhed in his old age, becaufe he 
could not, in his confeience, conform to Epifcopal government, 
and keep the King's fafts. Many of his people lhared the fame 
fate ; and in that number fome boys, becaufe they adhered to 
his principles, and were guilty of rudenefs to the curate who 
was appointed his fucceuor. But, though the ftory is not re- 
membered, the effects of it are ftill permanent and operative, 
and an antipathy to every form and inftitution fuppofed to be 
derived from Epifcopacy, has been inftilled with the rudiments 



of Antrum*

of education, and fofters prejudices which we behold with can- 
dour and allowance, when acquainted with the grounds on 
which they were originally founded. 

In a moral and religious view, the knowledge of local facts 
is important, for enabling us to form a proper eltimate of privi- 
leges peculiar to our owu times. It is certainly more fafe and 
candid to compare our political condition with that of our fa- 
thers, than with refined and vifionary theories of perfection 
which never exifted in any preceding age. The peace and li- 
berty which we enjoy, contrafted with the perfecution and ty- 
ranny under which ihey fufFered, are the moft obvious and for- 
cible arguments for loyalty to our Sovereign, a reverence for 
our laws, attachment to our conftitution, and gratitude to 
heaven

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">CLYNE</name>. 

(Frefhytery of Dornoch. — Synod of Sutherland and 
Caithnefs. — County of Sutherland.) 

By the Reverend Mr Walter Ross.</head> 



<p>Name, Extent, &amp;c. 

THE parifh of Clyne feems to have got its name from 
the Kirktown of the parifh, which is fituated on a de- 
clivity, and was called Clyne from the Celtic word claonodb 
or inclining. The inhabited part of it extends in length, 
from the N. W. to the S. E. about 24 meafured miles. Its 
greateft breadth, near the N. W. boundary, extends about 8, 
and on the S. or S. E. along the fhore, about 4 meafured 
miles. The form of the parifh is a trapezium. What may 
be called the Lowlands extends along the ftibre about 3 mea- 
fured miles, and towards the hill from the fhore, its greateft 
extent is about 1 \ mile, in fome parts not exceeding | mile. 

Population, Cattle, &amp;c. — The Lowland track contains about 
700 inhabitants; the remaining Highland part about 960 — 
The Highland part of the parifh breeds all the domeftic animals, 
viz. horfes, black cattle, fheep, and goats. No hogs are 
reared for exportation, but many by the inhabitants for their 
own ufe, which they fell to one another at no contemptible 
prices. Betwixt 400 and 500 black cattle are exported yearly 

from 



of Clyne. 299 

from the parifh, being fold to drovers for the fouth of Scot- 
land, and for England. This trade, however, is not yet well 
underftood or carried on under proper regulations, feveral 
dealers having of late found means, after getting pofTeflion 
of the cattle, to evade payment of the greatefl part of the 
price. This has been the fource of incredible confufion and 
diftrefs for a number of years paft, and the inhabitants of this 
parifh have fuffered deeply their own fhare of the public cala- 
mity. The dependence of the Highland part of the parifh 
for paying their rent, and fupporting their families, is upon 
the produce of their flocks and herds.

MannfaBuresy Commerce, £sV.— Very little induftry in ma- 
nufactures has hitherto been introduced among the inhabi. 
tants. Two gentlemen have of late fet up a retail fhop at 
Brora. They give out lint to be fpun, which is of ufe 
throughout this parifh and the whole country, employing be-

it is impoffible to afcertain the burials.

tvvixt 2000 and 3000 fpinners. The yarn is fent fouth to be 
manufactured. Salt pans were fet agoing at Brora, and great 
quantities made and exported by a company from Portfoy, in 
the time of the late Earl of Sutherland. This work was dif- 
eontinued about 16 years ago on account of the duty on the 
coal, thefeam found in the parifh being of a fulphureous qua- 
lity. It is to be wifhed that it were renewed with greater vi- 
gour. 

Soil, Produce, Zsfc. — -It is to be regretted that we are far be- 
hind our neighbours in Rofsfhire in the article of rearing 
lint, though our foil and climate feem to be very well adapt- 
ed to its cultivation. The inhabitants upon the coaft are 
chiefly farmers ; they fow principally bear, and, for alternate 
crops, oats and peafe. About the year 1756, planting of po- 
tatoes was introduced, and is ft ill pra£tifed throughout the 
whole parifh with great advantage. Every farmer has gene- 
rally one half of his pofTeffion under bear, and plants pota- 
toes in that half which was formerly allotted for peafe and 
oats. The bear land on the coaft fide is generally manured 
with fea weed or ware. There is hardly any fuch thing as 
leaving any fpot of land or ground, capable of culture, ley, or 
in any way of fummer fallow. In fhort very little progrefs 
in improvement has been made ; partly owing to the preju- 
dices of the people for old cuftoms, and partly to the reluc- 
tance that the managers of the affairs of the Sutherland fa- 
mily have always fhown to granting of leafes. The average 
produce from bear, on the coaft, is 6 returns ; of oats and 
peafe betwixt 4 and 5. In the Highland parts little is fown, and 
that only in choice fpots laborioufly manured and thinly fown, 
by which means the returns are frequently 10 or 12 feeds. 
"What may appear aftonifhing is, that, in many fpots, uninter- 
mitted crops of bear are taken without reft or change in the 

memory

memory of man.— The climate is wholefome. The prevailing 
difeafes are, coughs, colds, and rheumatifm Of late the 
coughs have frequently terminated in confumptions, and 
there are inftances of droply. 

Fi/Jjeries, &amp;c— There is a tolerable harbour for boats and 
fmall fhips at the mouth of the river Brora, which ieems 
to have given rile to the Merchant Company before men- 
tioned, who import goods from London and Aberdeen, and 
export linen-yarn manufactured from imported lint, and kelp 
made on the fhores of this, and the neighbouring parifhes of 
Loth and Golipie, of which one of the partners has had a 
tack for fome time pafr. Such of the inhabitants as are con- 
tiguous to the fea, fiih in fmall boats with hand lines in 
fummer, and are generally very fuccefsful. It is to be re- 
gretted that there is not a fcheme laid to carry on the filhing 
on a more extenfive fcale. The fea, and even the very fhores, 
abound with excellent fifh ; fo that our more induftrious 
neighbours, on the fouth fide of the Frith, come to our 
coaft and fifh during the fummer feafon, to great advan- 
tage. They frequently land their boats in our harbours, 
bait their lines, and never return home until they have a 
load of excellent fifh. In the midft of the river Brora, the 
cruives for intercepting the fifh, and the fifhing on that river, 
though its run is only 3 miles, is let to a company at 100 1. 
Sterling. The Highland part of this parifh, in common with 
the other Highlands of this country, is well provided in ex- 
cellent peats for fuel, and the coaft fide is furnifhed with that 
ufeful commodity in greater abundance than the neighbour- 
ing parifhes. 

There is a fpot of dry ground near Brora which turns out 
to little account at prefent, but would anfwer extremely well 
for a fifhing village, or for carrying on a manufacture. There 
are joiners, coopers, taylors, weavers, fhoemakers, fmiths, 

wheelwrights, 



Statijlical Account 



wheelwrights, (no gardners,) in the parifh ; but it can hard- 
ly be faid that any of thefe carry on bufinefs to any great pur- 
pofe, or live entirely by their craft. There is one good miln 
on the coaft fide, and fix equally good in the heights ; as alfo 
three of the kind called Highland milns, whofe wheels re- 
volve in a horizontal direction. 

Rent. — The writer cannot at prefent afcertain the exact 
contents of the arable part of the parifh in fquare meafure, 
nor even the valued rent or real, exactly ; he thinks the real 
rent will amount to 330 bolls of virtual, and about 500 1. 
Sterling. 

Ecclefiajiical State, Poor, C5*r.— The prefent ftipend is exart- 
ly 80 bolls virtual, and 22 1. 4 s. Sterling. It was fettled in 
1722. The incumbent has commenced a procefs of aug- 
mentation. There is no fund for the poor, except the week- 
ly collertions, which are very fmall, and inadequate to the fup- 
ply of the few poor ; but this defert is remedied by the alms 
given by the inhabitants to the begging poor, at milns, and 
their feveral dwellings. There are no religious ferts in the 
parilh. All the inhabitants profefs the eftablifhed religion, and 
attend public worfhip in the parifh church. There is a preach- 
ing place, at the diftance of about 8 miles from the church, 
called Afchoile, upon loch Brora, where of late the inhabi- 
tants of the parifh have begun to bury their dead. The mi- 
nifter ufualiy performs public worfhip there every fourth' 
Sabbath ; but, as the houfe at prefent is in difrepair, he can- 
not attempt public fervice there, but in favourable weather. 
There is no legal parifli fchool, but there is a parifh fchool- 
mafter with 100 merks of falary, who teaches children read- 
ing, writing, and a little arithmetic, in his own houfe. There 
is no fociety fchool now, but there was one in Strathbrora for 

many 



of dyne.

many years, which was of unfpeakable advantage to all the 
inhabitants of that diftria of the parilh. And the parifh now 
wants a benefit, that the people ftand much in need of, va- 
lue much, and would do any thing in their power to obtain. 

Appearance of the Country, Zsfc — Loch Brora is a beautiful 
fheet of water, extending in length 4 meaiurcd miles, and 
near a mile in breadth. At two different places it is fo contrac- 
ted as to exhibit the appearance of three lochs. It abound - 
with falmon, jar, and other trout of different kinds. Me r 
it on both fides are lofty mountains, at the feet of which rq 
lbme beautiful villages, and feveral kinds of natural wuud, 
chiefly belonging to Gordon of Carrall. The woods make a, 
very pi&amp;urelque appearance both in fummer and winter *. 

On 

* Antiquities. — There is a fuper-flructure of dry flone work, 
which bears the refemblance of an ancient work, and forms an 
ifland in the middle of the loch, at a confiderable diftance from 
the fhore, furrounded by deep water. Tradition relates, that the 
ifland is artificially conftrucTed, on an immenfe collection of 
flones brought there, fo well feleded and wrought, that. it muft 
have been a place of great fecurity before the invention of fire 
arms. The figure of the ifland is an oblong fquare, confiding 
of two Inferior fquares of 70 feet diameter. It was divided into 
two parts ; one half appropriated for lodgings in time of war ; 
the other half laid out for the advantage of a garden. The walls 
are ftill pretty high, and afcend perpendicularly from the fur- 
face of the water, without a veftige of the ifland behind them, 
and are only acceffible by two flairs which fronted the S. and E. ; 
fo that with plenty of ftores and the fifhing of the loch, abound- 
ing with falmon, trout, and eel, the place was rendered impregna- 
ble when, properly defended. Among many reports of the good 
purpofes of this ifland, there is one traditionary llory repeated 
with pleafure by the inhabitants to this day. They tell that, on 
a certain occafion, the neighbourhood was fuddenly invaded by 
a numerous army of Caithnefs men, which they were not pre- 
pared to refill. Upon this occafion they fled to the ifland for an 
afylum, where they were fecure from the affaults of the enemy. 
Upon this, the invaders were fo enraged, that they attempted 
darning up the narrow mouth of the loch, at which the river 

breaks 



Statijlical Account 



On the fouth fide of Loch Brora, there is a hill called 
Craig Bar, fortified with a ditch of circumvallatiou. It is a fteep • 
and rocky precipice, every way unacceffible, but by a narrow 
neck of land between it and a neighbouring hill. It contains 
about 8 acres of land, and could be eafily defended againft 
any number of afiailants. It has probably taken its name 
from fome captain of the name of Bar, who poflefTed it as a 
ftrong hold. There are feveral Pictifh buildings on each fide 
of the loch, forming a communication from the coaft to the 
northern fide of the peninfula. One village on the north 
fide of the loch bears the name of the famous Icolumkill, 
for it is called Kilchalumkill, it feems to have been a confe- 
crated place of interment, and to have derived its name from 
fome faint or hero buried in it. In digging fome ground at 
that place a cemetery was found, that contained large human 
bones, upon which a ftop was put to the digging there. At 
fome little diftance from it, a year or two ago, a gentleman 
making out part of the high road, found a ftone crofs, which 
was immediately erected in the place where it was found, and 
Is ftill to be feen there. There is another kill or cell on the 
fame fide of the loch, called Killean, which implies that it 
was the burying place of John j there are alfo two other 
places above the loch called Killpheader, or the burying 
ground of Peter ; the word kill or cell in the Celtic language 
fignifying a narrow place or the grave. Moft of the plains in

iflanders were obliged to take to their boats in the night-time, 
to accomplifh their efcape ; but, being purfued, they would have 
all perifhed, had it not been for the feafonable affiftance of the 
Clan Gun, who had marched from Strathulie upon hearing of 
the danger of their countrymen. The Caithnefs men, in confe- 
quence of this affiftance, met with a total defeat; and the part 
of the river, or loch, at which they had been employed, retains 
to this day the name of Daman or Davan, which fignifies a dam.

the parifh on or near the coaft, that have not been cultivated, 
feem evidently to have been the fcenes of battles, as they are 
full of tumuli, containing human bones. 

Rivers, Bridges, CSV.—- Several fmall ftreams from the 
neighbouring mountains and glens fall into the Loch of Bro- 
ra: The moll confiderable of them is a fmall river that runs 
from the N. W. taking its rife in the foreft of Clebrig in the 
parifh of Far, and, paffing through the north part of the pa- 
rifli of Rogart, is called the Water of Shiberfcrofs ; and an- 
other dream rifes at the N. £. from the foreft of Binormine, 
in the extremity of this parifh, both which meet at a village 
called Kilphidder More, and fall together into the northmoft 
end of Loch Brora. — There are no bridges worth mention- 
ing, on any of the numerous burns or rivers in the parilh, 
except one on the river at Brora, about a furlong above the 
place where it falls into the fea on the high road to Caithnefs 
and Orkney. Even this bridge, important as it is to the 
public, is in a ftate of great difrepair. The fea at full tide 
runs up in the river for above the bridge; and, at low water, 
it is four fathoms deep immediately below it. 

Mines, Minerals, £sV. — There feem to be mines of coal oi 
the coaft; pits of which have been at different times opened at

beth, as well as at different periods lince, when coal has been 
found and exported to different places on the Murray and 
Cromarty Friths. All along the coaft there are rocks of free- 
ftone, whence the hewn-ftone work of all the houfes in the 
neighbourhood, as well as grave-ftones and pavement, are 
quarried. There are likewife quarries of limeftone in the 
parifh ; one of them in a hill far above the level of the lea, 
and about a mile diftant from the fhore, which abounds with

any chalk or even Spanifh whitening ; it is found to anfwer 
very well for plafter. tSome fpecimens of it have been fent

NUMBER XXV. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7404674">SALINE</name>, 

(Prejbytery of Dunfermline, — Synod and County of 

Fife.) 

By the Reverend Mr William Forfar.</head> 



<p>Extent Name, CSV. 

THE parifh of Saline is 7 miles long from E. to W. and 
6 broad at the center from S. to N. becoming gradual- 
ly narrower towards the extremities. The E. part, and near- 
]y the half, is hilly and marfhy, the W. half very level. The 
moll probable account of the origin of the name, according 
to the opinion of a gentleman converfant in toponomy, is 
this. Saline is a contraction for Sa/viti or Salbin, bhean or 
bean, pronounced vin or bin, iignifies in Gaelic a hill or moun- 
tain •, and it being natural for the Scotch to fpeak ore aperto, 
fel is eaftly converted into /alj it is alio habitual for them to 
lupprefs the letter v, which may account for the formation 
of the name Saline as prefently ufed. Sal or fel is either 
Gaelic, fignifying great, or Saxon, fignifying great or good. 
Hence Salin or Salvin will denote a great hill j and as the 
hill called Saline Hill is of confiderable height, the pariih, 
and the village which lies at the foot of it, may have derived 
their names from this circumltance. The perpendicular

height of the hill, from the village where it begins to rife, ig 
more than a quarter of a mile *. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants in whole, includ- 
ing the fectaries, who do not exceed 20 or 30 perfons, is 
950, while the return to Dr Weblter in 1755 was 1285. 
One caufe of the decreafe was the removal of a great num- 
ber of cottars, poffeffing fmall tenements, which obliged them 
to feek refuge in other places. The number of proprietors 
1323, including thofe of the barony oflnzievar, which be- 
longs to this parifh quoad civilia, and to the parifh of Torry- 
burn quoad facra i and excluding 10 proprietors who have 
property in this pnrifh quoad facra, belonging to the parifhes 
of Torryburn and Dunfermline quoad civi/ia. Of all thefe, 
only 10 refide in the parifh. There are four freeholds ; Kil- 
lerny belonging to Major Aytoun ; Nether Kinneddar to Mr 
Haly ; Hillfide to the Reverend Mr Colvil ; and Inzievar to 
Mr Ronaldfon. 

Soil. — The foil is various, in general thin, and of a tilly 
bottom; fome parts, however, are remarkably good, of a 
loamy nature, and eafily wrought. Wheat, which is now 
coming more into ufe, has yielded 16 after 1, beans 15, bar- 
ley 20, though ufually feldom more than 8 or 10. There is 

an 

* The fame gentleman hazards another conjecture of the ori- 
gin of the name given to the hill, and confequently to the pa- 
rifh and village. There is an old ruin near the foot of Saline 
Hill, a little above the village, called Kill-erny. Kill and cell 
are known to be. fynonimous terms, to which the name of the 
founder or faint may have been added. Hence Kill-erny lite- 
rally fignilies the cell of £rny, and Saline Hill would moft na- 
turally^obtain the name of Cell-vin, or the hill where the cell 
was. In fupport of this, the Celtic word for cellar is JeiUir, 
which ftill feems to accord with the prefent orthography of the 
name Saline.

an infhnce of oats yielding upwards of 40 from 1, thinly fown 
after burnt mofs. Many parts are capable of great improve- 
ment, which hitherto have continued almoft in a ftate of na- 
ture. There is much need of draining and furamer plough- 
ing. Lime is too little ufed. Even near the village and 
, heart of the parifh, there is much wet and wafte ground, 
which, though capable of being fertilifed and beautified by 
Ikill and induftry, is likely frill to excite in the traveller the 
idea of poverty and indolence. Green crops are but little 
in ufe. Planting and inclofing have been praclifed a little, 
though they are ftill too much neglected. There are large 
tracks of mofs, fome of which yield excellent peat for fuel. 
There are two natural woods ; one of which was fold a few- 
years ago for upwards of 500 L Sterling ; belides thefe, there 
is a good deal of fine old afh, and of young oak, afh, and fir, 
in a thriving condition. 

Minerals. — The parifli abounds with coal in every part ; 
fome of it remarkably good, though little or none is wrought, 
owing partly to the inactive fpirit of the proprietors, but 
chiefly to the vicinity of Blairngone, which fupplies all the 
country round at a low price. There is alfo lime, and a 
good deal of ironftone; the quality of the latter is remarkably 
good. Two of the proprietors have given a leafe to the Do- 
van Company, one at 94. d. per ton, the other at 6d. the 
Company working it, and paying damages. 

Kent, Manufactures, &amp;c— The valued rent of the whole 
parilh is 4078 1. 19 s. 4 d. Scotch. The real rent may be 
about 250c 1. Sterling. The proprietors aflefied themfelves 
fome time ago for 48 ploughgates, though the real number 
may be 20 more The two horfe plough is now much ufed. 
Some farms are wholly let for grafs, which, in the hijly parts 

of 



3 10 Statiftical Account 

of the parifti,' are found to raife much better rents than til- 
lage. There are only 2 farmers who keep (heep. There 
are no manufactories. There are 3 wrights, 4 taylors, 3 
fhoemakers, 3 fmiths, 1 1 weavers, 8 mafons, 1 brewer, and 
1 maltfter. There are three corn-mills, and one fulling-mill. 
Wages are much the fame as in other places, and have been 
on the increafe for fome time. 



Poor, &amp;c. — The number of poor on the roll is 13, regular- 
ly fupplied by the intereft of a fund, amounting to 1.87 1. 15 s. 
6-j-d. Sterling. It was formerly much greater, till more than 
ipol. Sterling was loft by a failure. Betides the intereft of 
the above fum, the collections made on Sabbath, with mort- 
cloth money, marriages. &amp;c. may amount to 1 2 1. Sterling, 
annually. There are no travelling poor belonging to this 
parifh, though there is no want of fuch from other parithes ; 
a practice which ought not to be tolerated in a well regulat- 
ed ftate, as it extorts from charitable people, even'againft 
their own judgment, part of what they would otherwife be- 
llow with more pleafure and advantage among the refiding 
poor, whofe characters and circumitances are known to them. 
Births at an average, are about 16; deaths 10 or \i. The 
climate is healthy. There are no epidemical difeafes peculiar 
to this parifh. There are fome inftances of longevity, as in 
other places. Several have lived above 80 ; fome above 90 j 
one or two above 100 years. Within this century, there 
have flouriflied 15 minifters and preachers, 10 furgeons, 12 
bred to the law, 6 writers, 6 l'chooiinsffters, who were all 
born and received the rudiments of their education in this 
parilh. For a long period, paft it has been lets prolific of 
learned men. At prcfent there are none intended for any of 
the learned profeffions, except one, who has been for fome- 
time in the line of a writer.

Ecclefiajlical State and Sihool. — The tfnahfe was built about 
50 years ago; it is ruinous, and intended to be rebuilt this lum- 
mer. The church is alfo in a bad ftafe, having g--t no Mate- 
rial repairs for a long period; it will leatfcely admit of repairs 
now, and r.xo6ably itraft be foon rebuilt. L'he ftipend, which 
needs much to be augmented, is only 1000 merks Scotch, in- 
cluding communion . element m mey. which laft is no more 
than 1 1. 5 s. 9d. Sterling, a lum four times lefs than the 
minifter's actual expences on that occ ilion : This frnaU Cvtfa is 
never paid but when the facrament is adminitered, even when' 
it is not in the minifter's power to do fo. The whdle is p ;id 
in money ; formerly there was part in victual. There has 
been no augmentation for 50 years paft. The glebe is fmilt 
but good. There was a considerable quantity of excel ent 
wood growing on it, planted about 70 years ago, by the Re- 
verend Mr Bryce. Some of the heritors, ignorant of the i j v 
and the rights of a clergymen to every thing growing on his 
glebe, cut it down, and iold it for 30 1. Sterling, immediate- 
ly after the death of the laft incumbent. The prelbytery, as 
guardians, interferred; and, by the exi rtions of f uch of trie he- 
ritors as had all along difapproved of the unjuftifiable mea- 
fure taken by the reft, the matter was at length amicably fet- 
tled, and the money, arifing from the fale of the trees, was 
paid to the prefent incumbent ftiortly after his fettlement. 
There have been only 4 minifters here fince the revolution ; 
MefTrs Wyllie, Plenderleith, Bryce, and Hunter. The laft 
was fettled in the year 1732, was 60 years minifter in Saline, 
and died at the age of 95 ; his wife and children ail died long 
before him. The prefent incumbent was fettled on the 24th 
of January 1793. The crown is the undoubted patron.

quifites for marriages, &amp;c. rmy amount to 20 1. Sterling

Chara&amp;er.—The people, a few excepted, are fober, induf- 
trious, fenfible, difcreet, and peaceable, of as little fuperfti- 
tion and as much religion as their neighbours. They have 
been long diftinguifhed for their regular and decent atten- 
dance on public worfhip, and have not yet forfeited the praife 

which 

* There are no antiquities in the parifli, unlefs the remains 
of two old towers and fome cairns on the tops of hills, may be 
reckoned fuch. One of the towers called Killerny,' part of 
■which is yet (landing, feems to have been pretty large. It con- 
fided of two parts, called the N. and S. built at diffcren. times. 
The date of the S or neweft part, which confided chiefly of 
one large room, all arched and very high, was 1592. That of 
the other, which probably was a cell or hermitage, is unknown. 
The edate on which it Hands is faid to have belonged formerly 
to one Scot of Ealneiry; and fome fabulous dories are told about 
the murder of his lady and child, by the undertaker whom die 
employed to build the S- part for a fummer-houfe, but did not 
pay according to paction. As a puniftment for his crime, he is 
faid to have been confined in a part of the tower called the pri- 
fon, and fcd on his own fleih till he died. Some of the inhabi- 
tants have afong which celebrates thefe fuppofed tragical events, 
but its merit is not fuch as to entitle it to a place in the Statif- 
tical Account of Scotland. There is neither record nor oral tra- 
dition as to the date or founder of the other tower called the Kirk- 
land tower, part of which dill remains. It dands very near the 
church, on pnrt of the lands formerly belonging to the bifliop 
at Dunkeld, which dill bear the name of the KirkUnds, now be. 
longing to Sir William Eilkine of Toirie. It can hardly be 
doubted, were the matter to be invedigated, but the glebe, 
which is faid to be lefs than the law allows, would be entitled 
to an addition from thefe lands. The remains of two camps, as 
they are called, are dill to be feen, one on Saline hill, another 
on the low grounds ; the lad is faid to have been Roman. They 
are borh of a circular figure, and probably were originally Iheep 
or cattle folds, built with fome drength and art, in times when 
rapine and plunder were the means of fubfidance.

which is due to them on this account. They are avcrfe to 
long preachings, long prayers, and long pfalms their ideas 
of religion and morality, in general, are tolerably found and 
rational Thofe in better circumftances, of whom there is a 
good number in this parifh, are fociable, polite, and hofpi- 
table. 

Mifccllamotts Obfervations.—T\\t village of Saline ftrikes a 
traveller by its beautiful and rural fituation. It lies in the 
center of the parilh, in a place which, being moftly furroun- 
ded with rifing ground, is fometimes called the Bafon. It 
confifls, if fmall things may be compared with great, of the 
old and new town, and contains in all, including the fuburbs, 
200 inhabitants. 1 river, running through the middle, divides 
the old and new town; which laft has rifen within thefe few- 
years, excels the other, both in the number and neatnefs of 
its buildings, and is ftill on the increafe; were manufactures 
introduced, and encouragement given, it might foon become 
confiderable. The whole village confifts of fmall feus, all be- 
longing to Sir William Erlkine of Torrie, and the ground is 
ufually let at 2 1. an acre. There are four public houfes, 
none of which afford proper accommodation either for men 
or horfes. The chief article which is fold, pernicious fre- 
quently both to health and morals, is whifky. It is not Ion? 
fince an inhabitant of the parifh was killed by it, and was 
carried from the public houfe to his grave ; and foon after, 
another not more wife, nor warned by his example, had near- 
ly fhared the fame fate. One good public houfe would be 
better than the whole ; and as the great road from Dunferm- 
line to Auchterarder runs through the village, a man of cha- 
racter and fubftance who could alford proper accommodation, 
might meet with great encouragement. It is the molt cen- 
trical place between the Ferry and Glcndovan, for travellers to

halt at ; and if the proprietor were to build fuch a houfe, and 
let it to one who could afford to brew and bake, he would 
receive more than common intereft for his money, would 
confer a public benefit on the parilh and on travellers, be- 
fides inoeafing and ornamenting the village, which he has 
the pleafure to fre in a thriving and promiling condition*. 

* There is a practice here, too common in mod places, which, 
it were much to be wiftied, was aboiiftied or lefs ufed. When 
any one is taken ill, the neighbours think it their duty, or a 
piece of civility, immediately to frequent the houfe, and even 
crowd the room where the patient lies; which mud be attended 
with very bad effects. Even where the fmall-pox or fevers are 
raging, mothers With their children in their aims attend with- 
out fcruple, a practice rather templing, than trading in provi- 
dence, as it is unneceffarily expofing themfclves to danrer, 
which might be eafily avoided. On thefe occafions, they are all 
phyiicians ; they feel the pull'e, ihakc their heads, and have an 
unlucky turn to foreboding the word. I have known a man cfiv- 
en up by his neighbours, who, in three or four days after, has 
been working in the Hone quarry ; and Feyeral perfons are (till 
alive, in very good health at this day, and likely to lee fome 
carried to their graves, who had long ago pronounced their 
doom. 

A kin to this is a notion too common, though a miflaken one, 
that the minider of the parifh fhouid almoit condantiy attend 
the bed-fide of the fick. Where perfons are worn down with 
age aud infirmity, and have been long deprived of public in- 
ftfucTiori, they have a right to fee their minider, to converfe 
with him, and receive confolation, and fo in other cafes, where 
didrefs does not wholly unfit for convcrfation. But what can a 
minider, if he has not fome fkifl in phy lie, do or lay to one in 
the rage of a fever? he pretends not to work miracles, the pa- 
tient means not to make cor.fdfion, to take the facramer.t, or to 
receive extreme unction. When cudom is on the fide of what 
is right and profitable, it ought to be preferved and encouraged ; 
if otherw-ife, however popular, it fhouid receive no countenance.

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="NA">KILNIN-

{Prefbytery of Lorn. — Synod and County of Argyle.) 
By the Reverend Mr Patrick Campbell.</head> 



<p>Name and Extent. 

THE ftrictefi: refearch into the eytmology and meaning 
of ancient names muft often terminate in probable 
conjeclure ; and the following account of the names of thofe 
pariflies lays claim to no higher authority. — Kil-an-inver fig- 
nifies the chapel or burying-ground at the foot of the water, 
it being fituated where the Water of Euchar .difcharges itfelf 
into the fea. — Kilna-maolphorty contracted Kilmelfort, Agni- 
zes in the Gaelic language the chapel, or burying-place, of 
the round bays or harbours, viz. Lochmelfort, which runs 
three miles into the middle of this parifli, ending in two 
round bays with good anchoring ground, where fhips of any 
burden may ride in fafety. — Taken together, the united pa- 
riflies are nearly of a fquare form, extending from E. to W. 
and from N. to S. about 1 2 mealured miles. Kilmelfort 
lies fouth of Kilninver ; but in populoufnefs, valuation, and 
extent, does not exceed the one half of the other. The mi- 
nifter preaches in both alternately ; the diftance betwixt the 
two places of worfliip is fix miles. 

Soil 



3 l6 - Slaii/lkal Account 

Boil and Surface— 'The lower parts of thefe pariflies on 
the W. are generally fmooth (loping declivities towards the 
tea, and conlift of light loam upon gravel or rock, yielding, 
when properly cultivated, and in favourable feafons, good 
crops of corn, bear, and potatoes. The upper parts, towards 
the E. and S. arc mountainous, environed with a ridpe of 
hills, which feparate them from the pariflies of Kilmore, 
Dallavich, and Craignifli. The foil in Gleneuchar, and the 
Braes of Lorn in the parifli of Kilninver, and in the higher 
lands in the parifli of Kilmelfort is poor and gravelifh, 
yielding little crop, fit only for pafturage, and occupied rnofi- 
ly with fheep. A few farms, however, are flocked almoft 
wholly with black cattle— There is in thefe parilhes a good 
deal of natural wood fuch as oak, alh, birch, hazel, aller, 
&amp;c. Some parts alfo are planted with firs, which thrive 
very well. The tops of the hills, none of which are remark- 
ably high or rugged, are covered with heath interfperfed with 
ftripes of coarfe palture, well adapted for fheep. 

Sea Conjl. — Thefe united parilhes have fix miles of a fea 
coaft towards the N. and W. from the middle of Lochfea- 
chin, to the weft end of the Sound of Clacharfoail. In the 
mouth of Lochfeachin, a bank of fand lies acrofs its channel ; 
and, therefore, it is navigable only by fmall craft of about 
50 or 60 tons burden. At the foot of the Water of Euchar, 
and without this bank, two points of high land jutting out 
into the Sound of Mull, form a wide extenfive bay with 
good anchoring ground, but fomewhat expofed to the N. W. 
the floriny quarter on this coaft. From thence to the Sound 
of Ciachanfoail, there is a bold, reeky, and dangerous coaft. 
The Sound of Clachanfoail is about two miles long, and fe- 
parates the Ifland of Soail and parifli of Kilbrandan from 
the Continent. The Sound is narrow, being no more than

80 feet over, and admits veffels of only between 10 and 20 
tons burden, as it is dry and paffable at low water, in forns 
parts, both for men and horfes. It runs fmooth and ftraight, 
with a ftrong current, and forms a beautiful canal. Former- 
ly there was a ferry boat here, but lately there has been a 
bridge built over it, confiding of a fingle arch, 72 feet wide, 
and 27 feet above the higheft water mark. At both ends 
of the found there is good and fafe anchorage ; the whole 
forming a moft delightful and pi&amp;urefque fcenerv. 

Lochmelfort gives a fea coaft of fix miles, and makes a 
beautiful and fafe roadftead. Herrings frequent this loch, 
and the weft end of the found of Clachanfoail, and fome- 
times Lochfeachin, but they have been taken in greater quan- 
tity at Lochmelfort, where of late years a good deal have 
been caught. A good haddock bank has lately been difco- 
vered in this loch ; and the coaft upon the found of Mull 
abounds plentifully with fea-fifh in great variety. Thefe 
(hores furnifh alio moft kinds of fhell-fifh, lobfters, crabs, 
©yfters, fpout-fifh, hofe-fifh, cockles, and mufcles. 

Rivers and Lakes. — Thefe are the river Euchar, running 
through the middle of the parifh of Kilninver from the E. to 
the N. W. and having its fource in a lake of a mile and a 
h,.lf long and near a mile broad, called Lochfeammadale. 
Into this lake or loch the water of Braegleon, and a number 
of rivulets defending from the neighbouring hills, difcharge 
themielves. From this lake the river Euchar runs for 4 
miles N W. receiving in its courfe feveral tributary ftreams 
and rivulets, till it empties itielf, at the embouchure of Loch- 
feachin, into the Sound of Mull. At this place there is a 
good falmon fifhing, befides many others upon that loch. 
The river Oude, which takes its rife alfo from a lake in the 
braes of Lorn, called Lochtralig, of a mile long and about 

half 



Statiftical Accounl 



half a mile broad, runs through a part of the parifli of Kil- 
ninver towards the eaft, and thence, taking its courfe fouth- 
wards for 4 miles, falls into the head of Lochmelfort. Thefe 
rivers are ftored with falmon, white and muir trout, and 
eels. And upon Lochmelfort itfelf, where the Oude forms 
its junction with the fea, there is a falmon fifhing. There 
are a great number of other, but fmaller, rivers, lakes, and 
rivulets, in thefe parifhes, well fupplied with trout, and fome 
of them admit falmon into their mouth at fpawning time *. 

Population. — Thefe parifhes have, within thefe few years; 
greatly increafed in population, owing to the young men's 
continuing at home, and fettling in the parifh in time of 
peace, for war always drain off the youth. 

In 

* The climate here, as indeed on all the weft coaft, is ex- 
ceffively rainy and moift. The S. W. and wefterly winds, 
driving the clouds and exhalations from the great Atlantic O- 
cean, are conftantly accompanied with rain, as the E. and N. E. 
winds, paffing over a great track of continent, are generally dry. 
Hence our rainy fummers and harvefts, though commonly fa- 
vourable to pafturage, are very unfriendly to agriculture. From 
our vicinity to the Atlantic, the winters are open and tempe- 
rate ; fnow feldom lies deep, or above two days together, on 
the low grounds of the weft coaft. Notwithstanding the moif- 
ture of the climate, the people of thofe parifhes are healthy, and 
live to a good old age ; many till 90, a few to 100 years. 
The moft common dileafes are rheumatic complaints, colds, and 
cholics, the conllant attendants upon moift and rainy climates, 
bring often along with them confumptions, and other lingering, 
but deadly, diforders. Formerly the fmall- pox made great ra- 
vages among the children, efpecially upcm the fea- coaft, where 
the inhabitants feed much upon fifh. But inoculation is now 
praftifed with great fuccefs, and the lower clafs of people have 
quite got the better of the prejudices which they once enter- 
tained againft it, and which nothing but a conviction from ex. 
perience of its faiutary effects, could have overcome.

No family has emigrated to America from thofe parifhes

occurred within that period. 

Cattle and Sheep. — The breed of horfes, black cattle, and 
fheep, have been much improved in thefe parifhes of late 
years. Plough horfes, according to the kind and fize, fell at 
from 8 1. to 12 1. ; aged ftots from 5 1. to 7 1. j cows from 
3 1. to 6 1. ; black-faced fheep, all of the fouth country kind, 
from 12 s. to 14 s. ; flack ewes from 4 s. 6 d. to 6 s. 6 d. j 
hogs at 8 s. ; lambs at 4 s. and 5 s. ; wool at 7 s. per ftone, 
when white ; t2rred wool at 5 s. per ftone, 24 lib. weight to 
the ftone. The old fmall highland white-faced fheep are 
ftill retained in thofe parifhes by the fmall tenants ; though 
lefs in fize, they are finer in the wool, and reckoned more

1600 I. Sterling of real rent yearly. The valued rent is

Mifcellnncous Obfervations- —Thirty years ago very little 
white cats were lown in thole parilhes. Only fmall black 
oats were thrown into the ground, of which above a firlot 
went to make a Hone dark and weak meal. In the higher 
lands, three bolls of thofe fmall black oats rendered only a 
boll of meal 8 ftone weight. At prefent very little of thofe 
fmall black oats are ufed, and only in high grounds, as being 
leaft liable to be fhaken by the wind, and better fuited to the 
feeding of out lying cattle. Within thefe few years, fome 
improvement has been made in the mode and implements of 
hufbandry. The Englifli plough with two horfes and with- 
out a driver is generally ufed ; and raoft farmers keep a cart. 
Of late, fome of the low arable farms have been divided into 
three or four fmall farms, and inclofed, which promifes to 
turn out to the advantage of both landlord and tenant, as 
thereby a fpirit of induftry and emulation is awakened and 
kept up, the land better manured and cultivated; rye, grafs, 
and clover raifed, and more oats, bear, and potatoes, procur- 
ed in proportion to the fowing than heretofore. Thefe are 
the natural confequences of the tenants having liberty to act 
freely, and unlhackled by the will and opinions of three or 
four neighbours. This plan has alfo been followed by a necef- 
fary reduction in the number of cows and horfes, by which 
means thole kept are better reared and fed. 

It was a prevailing error of old, ftiil not quite worn out, in 
the management of pafture land, to put in too many cattle, and 
in agriculture to plough much without manuring properly. 
Out-field land, as formerly manured in this country by ham- 
mer folding, or teathiog, will not pay the coft of feed and 
labour, not to mention the great hurt done to the cattle. A 
few acres, well manured and cultivated, will yield a greater 
jind better return than double the number of acres poorly 
manured and cultivated, and the pafturage will be confider- 

ably

ably meliorated and enlarged. But though the fubdivfding 
of low arable land into fmall farms, or large crofts, may be 
rooft. beneficial, it is quite the reverfe in hill and high pafture 
Jand. The greater the range for fheep and young black cattle 
the better, and the expence of management the lefs. It is an 
unjuft and ill founded allegation, that the planting our hills 
and high pafture land with iheep has defolated our country, 
and been the chief caufe of emigration to America. To elu- 
cidate this pofition, it is to be obferved, that formerly thefe 
hills and high lands were grazed by ftots, young cattle, or 
dry cows to fatten for market ; very often only by goats, roe, 
and red deer. The largeft hill or glen planted with black 
cattle required only one herd to tend them, as well as the 
fheep do ; fo that both thefe methods of management, the 
flocking with black cattle or with fheep, thus far make no 
alteration in the population. But when it is further conli- 
dered, that the black cattle, paflured on the hills and high 
lands in fummer, could not be kept there in winter, without 
great danger of periGiing, as they often did, it muft be evi- 
dent that a certain confiderable track of low lying land, be- 
hoved to be withdrawn from the plough, and appropriated 
to the fupport of thofe cattle which had paftured on the hill:; 
in fummer. Of this fadf any perfon who travels through the 
highlands of Scotland, and obferves how much low arable 
land is laid wafte into winter inclofures for black cattle, mult 
be fully fenfible. So far then is the planting our hills and 
high glens with fheep from depopulating our country, that 
the very reverfe appears manifeftly to be the cafe, efpecially 
in thefe and the neighbouring parifhes. And when to this 
it is added, that the hills and higher lands yield better re- 
turns from fheep than from any other flock, that the fheep 
fweeten and enrich the land and grafs, and that they foon 
convert the dreary barren hill, and black heath into fine, 

rich, 



Statijlical Account 



rich, and green paflure, no doubt ought to remain that the 
Hocking thife hills with fheep, are, in every refpect, not only 
not prejudicial, but highly beneficial, to our country. 

The great and chief caufe of the frequent and numerous 
emigrations from the highlands to America, is the natural 
itcri'ity of the foil, which does not furnifh the means of 
fubfirtencc proportioned to the increafing population and 
number of inhabitants ; and, therefore, when they cannot 
procure employment in their native country, they are of ne- 
ceffity obliged to fearch for it in difiant and more fertile 
climes ; and as America, from common report, true or falfe, 
promifes the beft and readied: fupply of their more imme- 
diate wants, the rage of emigration to that quarter part of 
the globe, has prevailed much of late years. If the High- 
lander could find employment and the means of comfortable, 
or even bare, fubfiftence at home, fand his wants are not nu- 
merous) luch is his attachment to the imtale folum, that he 
would never think of banilhing himlelt for ever from his 
country in order to better his condition. It is no doubt 
true, that the ill-judged and unfeeling oppreffion of fome 
landlords in the Highlands of Scotland in raifing the rent of 
their lands beyond what the tenants can bear or pay, and in 
exacting of them perfonal fervices fo grievous, that they can r 
not attend to the proper management of their own pofTcf- 
fions, has been a productive caufe of emigration to America. 
The difadvantages are numerous. A rainy ftormy climate 
autumn Hoods and equinoctial florins, which often frultrate 
the labours of the induftrious farmer ; and what is a greater 
dilcouragement, he who raifes the bell and moll luxuriant 
crop, is fure to fnffcr mod from the ciiinate by lodging and 
fhaking. Only early and green crops can be cultivated to 
any advantage in fuch a climate. It is no unwarrantable af- 
fertton that the bell and richeft land upon the weft coaf£ 

will 



of Kilninvcr and Kilmelfort. r $tg 

will yield a better return, and pay a higher rent, in grafs and 
Lfturage, than in rating corn or grain. Another difadvan- 
rage to the inhabitants on the weft coaft is their great diftancc 
from proper markets to fell their cattle, and fupply them- 
fglves with meal, gram, and the other neceffaries of life, 
more particularly fuel. Their ordinary fuel, peats, for the 
moft part in the high rrmirs and inacceffible ground, trouble- 
fome in the making and cafting, require much time and ma- 
ny hands, and after all the drying and fecuring of them, 
uncertain and precarious in a climate fubjecl: to great rains. 
This is the principal ptrfonal fervice required by the land- 
lord from his tenant in thofe parifhes, and not likely to be 
difcontinued, as no gentleman or pofTeflbr of a farm can keep 
fuch a number of fervants as are neceiTary to fecure a fuffi- 
ciency of peats for the confumpt of his family, and day la- 
bourers cannot be had. The wife and judicious removal of 
the coal-duty, particularly if it flaall be joined with the in- 
troduction of manufactures, will tend more to the comfort 
and improvement of the highlands, than any thing that has 
yet been devifed.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011368">CARNWATH</name>. 



(County and Prejbytery of Lanark. — Synod ofGlafgow 

and Ayr. J 



By the Reverend Mr George Mark.</head> 



<p>Extent) Name, &amp;c. 




HE parifh of Carnwath is of confiderabie extent, mea 



JL furing 1 2 miles from S. to N. and 8 from E. to W. 
Its form is pretty regular, being that of an oblong fquare, 
one corner excepted, where the parifh of Dunfyre comes in a 
little. 

The name Carnwath is compounded of cam or eaim % fo 
common in Britain, and wath^ which in the Saxon language 
fignifies the ford or paflage of a river. This name is defcrip- 
tive of the fituation of the place ; for the little brook, which 
runs paft the weft lower end of the town, is not eafily ford- 
able on horfeback for a confiderabie way either above or be- 
low the village. 

Soil, &amp;c. — The foil is different in different parts of the pa- 
rifh. Round the village and neighbourhood the lands are 
fandy, with a mixture more or lefs of black loam. The holms 
of Clyde on the S. W. are a rich deep clay ; the holms of 
Medwin on the S. much more inclined tQ fand, owing to the 
fandy grounds through which that water runs for a confider- 
abie 



of Carnwath. 327 

able way above. In the muirland parts of the parifti the ara- 
ble lands are either a cold ftifF clay, or mofs, with clay or fand 
at bottom. The pafture grounds in thefe places are equal- 
ly different. In the dale land part (as it is here called) the 
grafs is iweet and good, fit either for rearing or fattening black; 
cattle or fheep, but in the muirland parts a large portion of 
the pafture is boggy ground, which produces plenty of a coarfe 
four benty grafs, calculated for rearing, but not for fattening, 
the cattle that are paftured upon it. Large tracts of fuck 
pafture lie along the banks of every rivulet which runs through 
the northern parts of the parifh. 

In the extenfive eftate of Count Lockhart of Lee and 
Carnwath, turnip farming has been lately introduced, with a 
certain rotation of crops to follow the turnip courfe, which 
the tenants, by their leafes, are bound to obferve. The 
greater part of that eftate in this diftrict feems to be well 
calculated for that mode of farming, as it is in general dry, 
inclined to fand ; but when the turnips are carried entirely 
off the field, for the purpofe of feeding cattle in the houfe,  
(which is the common practice at prefent), fuchcrop is found 
to impoverifh our fandy land exceedingly ; fo that if the far- 
mer does not reftore to the ground the dung produced by 
the turnips, he may lay his account with a very fcanty crop 
of barley the following feafon. The reafon feems to be, that 
the grounds, from the fandy nature of the foil, are eafily pul- 
verifed, and give their whole vegetable ftrength at once to 
the production of the turnips, and mult therefore be renew- 
ed with dung to put them into a condition for producing 
another crop. This new mode of farming, which was ex- 
ceedingly unpopular with the tenants at its firft introduction, 
bids fair, however, to increafe greatly the rent of the lands, 
and to better the condition of the tenants, A few years ago 
there was no fuch thing known in this diftrift as a turnip-fed 

bullock 



3 28 Statiflical Account 

bullock or cow ; but now there is not a tenant, who holds his 
farm by a late leafc, who does not feed from 5 to j o, and 
fome of them upwards of 20, black cattle every feafon, which 
have hitherto turned to very good account, each yielding 
from 2I. to 3I. 10 s. profit, and fometimes more The land, 
after the turnip crop, is lown down with barky, clover, and 
rye grafs ; the grafs is cut the year following, and paftur- 
cd for the next four, and at fecond lifting is fubjeaed to a 
different rotation. 

In the muirland part of the parifh the turnip farming has 
not as yet been much tried ; and, indeed, neither the foil nor 
climate feem to be fitted for fuch a crop. Neither the dale 
nor muirland part of the parifh has been much efteemed for 
the production of peafe. There is in general plenty of ftraw, 
but often very little grain. When the land in the inuirs is 
properly cleaned, and fown down with clover and rye-grafs, 
it feldom fails to produce an excellent crop of hay. 

In the molly lands there is a peculiar mode of cultivation 
obferved. When the mofs is deep, and fo foft as not to bear 
the plough horfes in winter, it is fometimes ploughed in the 
drought of fummer; burnt when fo dry as to burn, the 
afhes fpread over the whole, and then fown down in the 
fpring, without any further cultivation, with barley and oats ; 
and in favourable feafons a very rich crop is produced. Mofs, 
of this kind, repeatedly bufnt, becomes thinner and thinner, 
till it difappears almoft or altogether, and leaves the ciay, 
that was once three or four feet down, on the furface. Some 
hundreds of acres have been converted in this manner from 
mofs to arable land; and it is probable, that in half a century 
there will be but little mofs of this kind in the parifh, in 
comparifon of what there is at prefent. But there are 01 her 
extenfive molTes in this diftridl, commonly called flowes, 
which it is not probable ever will, or ever can be, converted 

into 



of Carnzvaih,

into arable land. Some of thefe flovves are found to be 20, 
25, or 30 feet deep, and are, betides, fuch a dead level, that 
the water has little or no defcent ; and even fuppofing they 
fhould be caft, or burnt to the bottom, (landing pools of 
dirty water could only ftand in their place. 

Every farmer in the parifh raifes potatoes, in greater or lefs 
quantities, for the ufe of their families i they are fometimes ufed 
alfo for feeding their labouring or fattening their other cattle. 
The cottars and poor people in the village of Carnwath and 
the other villages of the parifh, have allowed them, by the 
neighbouring farmers, ground for planting 2, 3, or 4 pecks 
of potatoes, for fuch a number of days (hearing in the har- 
veft as can be agreed upon, infomuch that the potatoes raifed 
in this manner make a confiderable part of the food of thefe 
poor people for more than fix months in the year. This 
root anfwers exceedingly well with our fandy lands, which 
produce not only large quantities, but good in their kind ; 
but the cold ftiff clay does not anfwer fo well. The farmers 
obferve that they have better crops from potatoe than from 
turnip land, with an equal quantity of dung. 

Little flax is fown in the parifli, excepting for domeftic 
purpofes ; what is raifed for fale is exceeding trifling. The 
poor people have commonly, along with their cottage, ground 
for fowing half a peck of lintfeed. The flax thus raifed is 
partly applied to family ufe, the remainder fpun in winter 
into yarn of a fpindle per pound, which is in general fold"to 
the Glafgow manufacturers, at Lanark fairs, from 2 s. 2d. to 
2 s. 6 d. Oats and barley, or beer, are the common crops 
of this diftricTt ; and on thefe the farmer principally depends 
for the payment of his rent. It is difficult to afcertain the 
value of the land in this parifh, as there are fome thoufand 
acres in it not worth 6 d. per acre. The infield land about 
the village and neighbourhood is let from 20 s. to 30 s. or 
Vol.X. T t 7. 1. 15 s. 



Statijlical Account 



1 1. 15s. per acre; the holms on Clyde and Medwin are va- 
lued at about 15 s. per acre, and the outfield lands from 5 s. 
to 10s. Befidcs the grounds already defcribed, there are a 
few extenfive fhecp farms, moftly covered with heath, better 
fitted for breeding and rearing fheep, than fattening them 
for the butcher Excepting a few (mall fi xks kept in the lower 
part of the parifh, thefe florks confifl of ewes bought in, in the 
fpring, the lambs fold in the fummer commonly to the Giaf- 
gow, Hamilton, or Linlithgow butchers, and the ewes Ibid 
to the fame at the end of harveft. The fheep kept in the 
parifh may amount altogether to about 7000. The number 
of black cattle, young and old, may amount to nearly 1 700 ; 
and the ploughs in the parifh to about 80; and as 
thefe are, in general, drawn by four horfes, the number of 
the latter is confequently 320. Befidei, few of the farmers 
poffeffing a ploughgate of land* have fome two, others 
three, or perhaps four young horfes ; and the fmall tenants 
have one or two for the purpofe of driving coals, or meal 
for the Glafgow market ; fo that the total number of horfes 
may be nearly eftimatcd at 700. 

Manufactures. — There are no manufactures carried on in 
this parilh, (Wiifontown excepted,) but what are, necelTary 
for fupplying the coniumpt of the inhabitants. There 
are confidcrable numbers of weavers both in the village, and 
in different parts cf the parifh ; but their fole employment is 
to weave the cloth wanted for the private ufe of their neigh- 
bours. There are a few flocking-weavers in the place who 
work for the Glafgow manufacturers ; and an expert and di- 
ligent tradefman in this line may earn from 2 s. to 2 s. 6d. 
per day. 

At Wiifontown, in the northern part of the parifh, an ex- 
tcafive iron-foundry was fomc years ago erected by two bro- 
thers, 



of Carnwath. 33 \ 

thers, of the name of Wilfon, of the Cleugh family, Swedifli 
merchants in London, both gentlemen of interprife and 
large capital ; and although the manufacture is unluckily fub- 
jected to a temporary ftagnation, yet no doubt can be enter- 
tained of its turning out a very beneficial fpecuhtion to the 
proprietors. This work is peculiarly happy in its fituation. 
with refpedt to materials, for in the very ground on which 
the blalt furnaces are erected (two in number) there are coai*, 
ironftone, limeitone, and fire-clay, all efientially neceflary f r 
carrying on the manufacture ; and perhaps there is not a 
work of the kind in Britain, which has all thefe materials fo 
near at hand, and in fuch abundance. The land carriage of 
the iron to the neareft port, Borrowftounnels, is about 18 
miles, and to Leith about 27 ; but, by a line of road now 
marked out, the diftance to Leith will be reduced to about 
2 1 miles. The carriage in fummer is about 8 s. and in win- 
ter 1 os. per ton. — The workmen, of different defcriptions, 
employed before the temporary ftagnation mentioned above, 
fuch as, furnace-men, forge-men, miners, coalliers, &amp;c. with 
their families, may be computed at upwards of 400. The 
blaft furnaces are employed in calling pig-iron, and ten 
forges in converting thefe pigs into blooms, a name given to 
the iron before it undergoes the laft operation, viz. beating 
out into bars. 

Population. — There are about 3000 in the parifli, of thefe, 

1397 Males 
1603 Females.

The return to Dr Webfter in 1755 was " 2 39° foul 3 * 
As the regifter of births and baptifms in the parifh is very 
incomplete, no certain computation can be founded upon ; 
and the reafon is, that many of the Diflenters do not regif- 
ter the names of their children at all ; nor does the regifter 
of marriages afford more certain grounds on which to pro- 
ceed, as fome of the Cameronians do not give in their names 
for proclamation of banns, and many more go into Edin- 
burgh, and are there privately married j fome by the eftab- 
lifhed clergy on extract of proclamation of banns from the 
feffion- clerks of Edinburgh, and fome by perfons unknown. 

The DhTenter9 of different denominations fuch as, Burghers, 
Antiburghers, of the Relief congregation, and Cameronians, 
amount to about one in ten of the whole number of parifliio- 
ners. Conveniency greatly increafes the number of the 
Burgher DifTenters, as the northern parts of the parifli lie 
confiderably nearer to the Seceding Meeting-Hqufe at Long 
Ridges in the parifh of Whitburn than to the parifh church, 
and the roads to the former are much better.— The popula- 
tion of the parifli would have fuffered a very great decreafe 
of late, had there not been a confiderable influx of Grangers 
to the Wilfontown works. The inhabitants of the village of 
Carnwath are greatly diminifhed within thefe 5 years. In 
1788 the prefent incumbent took up an accurate lift of the 
examinable perfons in the parifh, the number of thefe in the 
village (i. e. from 8 years old and upwards) was 498 : In 1793 
he made up an exact lift of the number of fouls, and found 
the whole to be no more than 500; fo that in little more 
than 4 years the number of inhabitants had decreafed about 
70. This diminution was occafioned by many of the low 

houfes 



of Carnwath.

houfes being allowed to fall into ruins; and the reafon of this 
was, that the tenants in the place, at the laft let of the lands, 
had fuch a fmall pittance allowed to each, that they could 
not afford their cottagers any longer the ground neceffary 
for their potatoes and lint, which had formerly gone along 
with the cottage. Newbigging, another confxderable village 
in the parifh, is alfo diminifhed in the number of its inhabi- 
tants, though not to fuch a degree as Carnwath. 

Heritors and Rent. — There are many heritors in this parifh ; 
the moft confiderable are, Count Lockhart of Lee and Carn- 
wath, Lord Braxfield, William Bertram of Nifbet, Sir James 
Stewart Denholm of Coltnefs and Wichfield, John and Wil- 
liam Wilfons of Wilfontown, William Tenant of Pool, Mrs 
Lockhart of Eaftfield, Mr Logan of Woodend, and upwards 
of 30 more. Thefe laft, two or three excepted, refide on their 
own property, confiding of farms from 80 I. down to 10 1. 
of annual rent, which they, in general, occupy themfelves. 
The Houfe of Carnwath never was the refidence of the Lock- 
hart family, but has been occafionally ufed as a hunting-feat. 
The only heritor of note who refides conftantly in the parifh 
is William Bertram, Efq; at Kerfwell, about two Englifh 
miles from Carnwath. — The valued rent of the parifh is up- 
wards of 5000 1. Scotch ; the real rent, putting a proper va- 
lue on the farms pofTefTed by the different proprietors, is 
about 5000 1. Sterling. 

Rivers and Lakes.— 0£ thefe the Clyde, on the S. W. 
boundary, is the moft confiderable. The N. and S. Medwins, 
which unite their ftreams on the S. about a mile before they 
fall into the river Clyde; Dippool, which divides the parifh 
nearly into equal parts, and Cleugh Burn, are but fmall rivu- 
lets compared with the Clyde. There is plenty of trout in

the Clyde. The water that comes from the iron-works Teems 
to be unfriendly to trouts, as none are to be found for a great 
way below the works, where they formerly abounded. Few 
eels are found in any of thefe waters, and no falmon above 
the falls of the Clyde. There is a lake 4 of a mile to the 
W. of the village of Carnwath, more than a mile in circum- 
ference j fmall perch are the only fifn found in it. 

^ Minerals, CsV— On the N. fide of Dippool, coal, iron, and 
limeftone abound every where ; the fprings and fmall ftreams 
on this fide are, in general, hard water., not good for tea, 
wafhing, or for watering flax. To the S. of this water, no coal, 
and little iron and limeftone have been difcovered •, and the 
fprings and finall ftreams on this fide are comnv nly foft. 
Freeftone abounds in every part of the parifli. At Wilfori- 
town the freeftone is of a greyilh white colour foft when ta- 
ken out of the quarry, but hardening when expoied for a 
time to the air. Stones of any dimenfion may be raifed out 
of the quarries at Wilfontown. In the fouth parts of the 
parifh the freeftone is of a reddith colour. Although none 
of the riling grounds in the parifli can with propriety be cal- 
led a mountain, yet Leven Seat, on the northern boundary, 
is about 1 200 feet above the bed of the Clyde, but as the 
afcent is long and gradual, it does not appear to the eye to 
be fo high as it ia in reality *.

* There are but few antiquities and curiofities in this diRridl 
worthy of notice. At the weft end of the village of Carnwath, 
there is a large tumulus or moat evidently artificial, of a form 
fomewliat elliptical, the diameter from E. to W. longer than 
that from N. to S. There is an opening on the top which has 
been the entrance of a rude turnpike fort of ftair, that once 
reached to the bottom, but is at prefent filled up with ftones and 
rubbilh thrown in from time to time by young and idle people.

This feems to fnggeft that it was not only originally meant for, 
felt intended to continue, a burying-place: It is furrounded with 
a deep ditch and large mound round the whole. It was, upwards 
of 40 years ago, planted with Scotch firs, which have grown but 
{lowly. 

On the weft fide of the large mofs or cave to the north of the 
village, on a narrow point of dry land that juts out a little into 
the mofs, are the ruins of the Caftle of Couthalley, the feat of 
the ancient family of Sommerville, a branch of the Sommer- 
vilJes of Whitmor in England, and which fettled in tliis coun- 
try about the middle of the 12th century. This family, the 
mnft powerful and opulent in this part of the country, were at 
one time poifeffed of the baronies of Carnwath and Liberton in 
Clydefdale, and of Linton in Tweeddale. Sir John Somerville 
of Carnw;th and Linton was a Ready and faithful adherent of 
Robert Bruce, in the violent and bloody conteft he had to 
maintain for the crown. This Caftle has once been a place of 
great ftrength, furrounded with an exceeding deep ditch and 
large earthen mound, the entry being by a diaw-bridge on the 
W. Tradition fays that it got the name Couthalley, (which 
fignifies a warm fheltered walk or avenue,) becaufe at this time 
there was an avenue from the Caftle all the way to the village 
of Carnwath, bordered on each iide by full grown oaks; and 
what feems to give weight and confirmation to this tradition, is, 
that when this, mofs is dug to the bottom, Urge oaks are often 
found, fome of them in a furprifing ftat.e of prefervation, con- 
fidering the amazing depth at which they now lie. Befides oaks, 
there are alfo Scotch firs, birches, alder, hazel, &amp;c. found at 
the bottom. Some of the nuts appear entire till touched, but the 
flighted touch breaks them to pieces. The vegetables found on 
the furface of this mofs are a dry ftunted kind of heath, and a 
Ilrong thick white mofs, vulgarly called fog. What is ftngular, 
the peats dug out of this mofs to the depth of 3 or 4 feet, are 
evidently compofed of this white fog, clofely cemented with a 
black matter, which feems to be the heath completely rotten. 
One or thefe peats, thoroughly dried, if catiouily rubbed be- 
twixt ones hands may be again reduced to that white fog, which 
conftitutes its principal part, the black matter, which, like glue, 
connected the peat together, moulders down in the operation to

the parifh, but fome time ago this fum was unhappily lent on 
perfonal fecurity. The debtors failed, and neither ftock nor in- 
tereft could be recovered for i c years paft, which has reduced 
the panfh to much difficulty in fupporting the poor. In that 
diflreffing year for this country, 1783, a contribution was fet 
on foot, and 72 1. was collected, moftly from the principal he- 
ritors. This fum was laid out in the purchafe of oat meal, 
which was fold to the poor at the reduced price of 10 d. per 
peck ; the remainders of the original ftock was laid out in the 
fame manner three or four times, and the meal ftill fold 
at the lame price till the month of September following, 
when the capital was then reduced to a few (hillings of bad 
halfpence. For 9 months 105 families received of this meal 
every 14 days, which rendered their condition, in that ftraiten- 
ing time, more comfortable than moft of their neighbours. 
For thefe 15 years, that neither ftock nor intereft could be 
got, the poor have been fupported by the collections made 
in the church on Sundays, mortcloths, and the dues for the 
proclamation of banns, and by occafional charities from the

the white fog is found equally rotten with the heath, and the 
peat becomes hard and black, and exceeding good fuel. This 
affords a demonftrative proof, that all mofs, however deep, is 
compofed of the vegetables that once grew on the furfacc. In 
the f reeftone quarry at Wilfontown, there was dug up a few 
years ago the trunk of a large oak tree, fome feet below the fur- 
face, completely petrified. The fide of the tree that lay upmoft 
had loft the bark and part of the wood by rotting, before this 
petrifaction had come ch ; but the under iide had the bark en- 
tire, with all that irregular fluting, which is obfervable on the 
bark of every full grown oak. 

There are feveral mineral fprings in different parts of the pa- 
rifh impregnated with iron and fulphur, but the moft remark- 
able is a fpring on Leven Seat, fo ftrongly impregnated with 
allum, that when tafted, for one can only tafte it, it affects the 
mouth as if it were liquid allum, fo that it is with difficulty that 
the lips can be feparated. The water is fo amazingly cold, that

in the church amount annually to 25 1. ; the mortcloths, &amp;c.

cumftances of individuals require. 

Ecclefiajlkal State Both church and manfe are in very bad 

condition, and both ought to be rebuilt, as they are too bad 
to admit of repair. I he church is an antient fabric. The 
aile, which has fucceffively been the burying place of the 
Somerville family, of the Dalziels Earls of Carnwath, and 
now of Count Lockhart of Lee, was built in 1424, and is a 
Gothic ltru&amp;ure, covered with free ftone flags. There is 
no record exifting to give information when the body of the 
church was erected j but from the difference of architecture 
it appears to have been built at different times. It is 100 feet 
within the walls in length, and 20 in breadth, which renders 
it very inconvenient as a place of worfhip. The church of 
Carnwath was founded in 1424 by Sir Thomas Somerville of 
Carnwath, for a provoft and 6 prebendaries. There was at 
the lame time, and by the fame perfon, provifion made for 
the maintenance of 8 poor old men. Count Lockhart of Lee 
is patron. The ftipend, by a late decree of augmentation, is 
29 1. in money, and 4 -chalders of meal. The glebe confifts 
of 9 acres and one rood. The manfe was built in 1 749 ; but, 
from its prefent wretched condition, it appears to have been 
badly executed at firft *.

Mifccllaneous Obfervations — The road from Edinburgh to 
Lanark and Air, and that from Peebles to Glafgow, pafs 
through this village : The former was completely made fome 
years ago ; the other is now nearly fo. As all the northern 
parts of the parifh, and fome of the N. E. abound in coal, 
that is therefore the common fuel, but the people both in 
the muirland and lower parts of the parifh, in general, burn 
peat along with the coal, which is far from being a laftins 
hre, as the peat burns the coal quickly away. The inhabi- 
tants of this place have been long accuftomed to caft peats, 
and cannot be brought to give up the cuftom, although, rec- 
koning the labour, which makes a confiderable part of their 
fummer work, they are a more expenfive fuel than coal. 
The price of the coal at Wilfontown (6 Englifh miles from 
the village of Carnwath,) is 24. d. per cwt. At Clempy 
coal-hill, (much the fame diftance) the price is 8 d. per 34 
ftone, which in winter is all that can be carried on a (ingle 
horfe cart. 

The price of butcher meat here is much the fame as it is 
in the markets of Edinburgh and Lanark. Oat meal is in ge- 
neral a little cheaper in the Carnwath market than in Lanark, 
Hamilton, Glafgow. Before the Clyde and Forth canal was 
made, meal was fold here at 2 s. or 2 s. 6d. per boll, below 
what it brought at Glafgow ; and it was a confiderable part of 
the bufinefs of the tenants, whofe fmall farms did not afford

women who have arrived at the age of 50 years, and many be- 
fore that period, are much diflrcffed with rheumatifm, which 
often renders the decline of life exceedingly hard and heavy un- 
to them. There is one perfon now living upwards of 91 ; and 
what is remarkable, this man was the father of a child at the age 
of 80, and his wife at that time was more than 51. 

Notwithftanding the evident utility of inoculation, it gains 
orouhd but flowly among the country people here; but it is to 
be hoped that their prejudices againft it will gradually wear off, 
and this falutary method for the prefervation of life be univer- 
fally adopted.

them conftant employment, to carry it clown to Cambuf- 
ncthan for the fupply of the Glafgow market. There are two 
weekly markets in this place, in which meal and bear are 
the principal commodities bought and fold. There are 5 
fairs in the year, but only two are coniiderable ; one on the 
laft Thurfday of June old ftyle ; the others about the middle 
of Auguft. The price of labour has been greatly increased 
iince the introduction of the iron and cotton manufacture. 
The wages of a good plowman, who lives in the farmers houfe, 
are from 61. to 8 1. ; the wages of a female fervant from 3 1. 
to 4 I. per annum ; the wages of a day labourer from 1 s. to 
14 d. or 16 d. ; the wages of a good (hearer engaged for the 
harveft, for a man from 21s. to 25 s. for a woman from 
18 s. to 20 s. It is a common obfervation in the place, that 
although the wages of fervants are greatly increafcd, they in 
general fave lefs than when their wages were fmaller, as they 
are much more expenfive in drefs than they formerly were. 
The fervant men all wear Englifh cloth ; and the fervant 
maids are much better drefled on Sundays and at fairs and 
markets than their miftrefTes were a few years ago. The 
Scotch dialect is fpoken here, not without a confiderable mix- 
ture of provincial peculiarities *,

* There are fix public houfes in the village, in which fmail- 
beer, porter, but particularly whifky, are fold ; and it is to be 
regretted, that this laft article lhould be fo cheap, as it is evident- 
ly tending in this place to debauch the morals of the lower 
claffes. The quantity confumed here is almoft incredible ; and 
thofe who are leaft able to fpare from their families are mod 
addi&amp;ed to this abominable beverage. Befides thefe public 
houfes, the fame liquors are fold in every (hop in the place ; of 
fuch (hops there are five in the village, and others in different 
parts of the parifh. The innocence and fimplicity of the com- 
mons in this part of the country are confequently on the decline. 
To attain a little fmattering of law is alio become an object of 
attention to a few ; and it is to be doubted, not with an inten- 
tion that they may be enabled to act with more jultice and ho. 
nefty, but the quirks of it are rather ftudied to give them the 
advantage of others.

The moft effential improvement of this part of ihe coun- 
try would be to indole the grounds wiih broad belts of 
planting for fhelt. r. The village of Carnwath fcmaof parts 
of the parifh are higher) is no left, than 650 feet above the 
level of the fea; it may therefore be eafiiy judged that (belter 
is abfolutely neceflary. This diftrift ought to be made a graz- 
ing rather than a corn country, the fpring feafoh being un- 
commonly wet, fo that the lands are leldom in a proper con- 
dition when they are fown, and the frofts corne on fo early, 
that they often hurt, and fometimes almoft deftroy the crop. 
The fatal effe&amp;s of thefe frofts are fo jufth and dntin&amp;ly des- 
cribed in the Statiftical Account of the parifh of Linton in 
Tweeddale, as to render it unnectfiary to lay n.ore on the 
fubjedt. From the caufes now mentioned, there has fcarce 
been a crop in the muirland part of this parifh flnce 1783, 
which ha? repaid the farmer for feed and labour, and in 
many of thefe years his returns have by no means done fo. 
Were the fields inclofed in the manner mentioned above, and 
laid down in good heart into grafs, few parts of the country 
would produce more or better, and were thefe fields plough- 
ed only after lying 6, 7, or 8 years in pafture, the produce 
of one acre might well be computed equal to the produce of 
two in the general mode of farming at prefent. 1 here is 
plenty of lime ftone in the middle of the parifh, and a feam 
of coal immediately under it, fufficient to burn the ftone: It 
is fold at $Ld. per boll flacked lime. To have this ma- 
terial fo near at hand is certainly of advantage for the im- 
provement of the diftricl. It is found that laying lime upon 
lands which produce four coarfe grafs, fweetens it much, 
and increafeth the quantity. As Carnwath is fituated at a 
little diftance from an wool country (Tweeddale), fuel cheap, 
and the houft,s lew rented, it would be a proper place for ef- 

tablifhing

tabJifhing a woollen manufactory, was any perfon of fpirit and 
capital to engage in that branch of bufinefs. 

Some of the intelligent farmers are now fenfible of their 
miftake, in allowing their cott-houfes to fall into ruins ; for 
although the rent of thele houfes was not an objett of impor- 
tance, yet they were the nurfery of the fervants both male and 
female that were wanted in the country. By allowing thefe 
houfes to go to ruin, the poor inhabitants are removed to the 
manufacloring towns, and the farmers find it exceedingly dif- 
ficult to procure workmen to carry on the neceiTary bufinefs 
of the farms.

(Prejbytery of Uijl — Synod and County of Invernefs.) 

By the Reverend Mr John Macleod.</head> 



<p>ILL of late, this parifli has been defigned Kilbride, from 



JL one of the churches or cells in it fo called. It is now- 
denominated, in Englifh, Harris, and, in the vernacular dia- 
lect, Na Heradh, i. e. the Herries, plural ; a name which feems 
to be Gaelic, though we cannot pretend to trace its origin 
with precifion. A fanciful etymologift might derive it from 
na hardubh, fignifying the heights ; this parifli being in reality 
the higheft and moft mountainous part of the Long Ifknd, 
in which it is fituated j and another circumftance, which feems 
to give countenance to this derivation, is, that the higheft 
part of the Ifland of Rum, another of the Hebrides, is alfo 
called Na Heradh. Along the E. fide of the parifli runs the 
Channel, which feparates the Long Ifland from Sky and the 
Continent. Its W. coaft is waihed by the Great Atlantic 
Ocean ; and, on the fouthern extremity, it is bounded by the 
parifh of North Uift, from which it is feparated by a narrow 
Sound, running betwixt the ifland of Berneray and Uift, cal- 
led Caolas Uift j u e. the Sound of Uift.

It is difficult to defcribe the form of this parifti under one 
view, it being compofed of feven large inhabited iflands, and 
a multitude of lefier ones uninhabited, moft of which are ir- 
regularly interfperfed through the Sound of Harris, and the 
reft on each fide of Harris, properly fo called, a peninfula of 
Lewis; towards which country it ftretches from S. to N. an 
immenfe diftance, and exhibits to the view a group of lofty 
rugged mountains, oddly huddled together, 4 Rudis indigejla- 
* que moles? Neither is it eafy to afcertain the precife extent 
of the whole, nor, indeed, of any particular diflrict of it. We 
are not acquainted with any accurate menfuration of diftances 
taken here, and the computation of the people by miles is at 
beft uncertain. In this account, however, we muft, for want 
of better, adopt it as our rule, allowing (for fo we fafely may) 
every Scotch computed mile to meafure i \ Englifh. At this 
rate, then, the parifh of Harris, from the northern to the 
fouthern extremity, along the common track of travelling by 
land, and the courfe of navigation through the Sound, will 
be at leaft 48 miles long : Its breadth varies much. Near the 
northern extremity it is 24 miles ; from thence to the Sound, 
it may be at an average from 6 to 7 ; and, of the Sound, na- 
vigators calculate the breadth as well as length at 3 leagues. 

Divifion of Difricls. — As the remote and much neglected 
quarter of the Britifh Ifles, in which this parifh is fituated, 
is, in general, but very imperfectly known to the public at 
prefent ; and as it may at fome future period aflume that im- 
portance in the political fyftem, to which its immenfe extent, 
its many natural advantages, and the genius of its inhabitants, 
appear to entitle it, the inquifitive reader will readily pardon 
in a work of this nature a particularity of defcription, which, 
given of places better known, might juftly be deemed fuper- 
fluous and impertinent. In delineating the topography of a

form, foil, and furface, as is the pari fh of Harris, even pro- 
lixity of defcription is not eafily avoided. To render this ac- 
count in fome degree regular and intelligible, we muft divide 
the parifh into three feparate diftrifts ; and, proceeding in our 
furvey, according to the general plan of this work, from the 
fouthern extremity northward, thefe are as follows : i/?, The 
Southern Ifles lying in the Sound of Harris. 2d, The main- 
land of Harris within Tarbert. And. 3^, The foreft or out- 
er hills of Harris, and the Northern Iiles. 



I. Defcription of the South Ifles of Harris. 

Of thefe four are inhabited, viz. Berneray, Pabbay, Calli- 
gray, and Enlay. The names of thefe, and ilmoft of all the 
iflands about Harris, are fuppofed to be of'Danifh origin. 
Their general appearance is either flat or gently floping from 
a little elevation in the middle. Berneray, lying about a mile 
N. of Uift, is a beautiful and fertile ifland, about 4 miles in 
length, and 1 % mile in breadth. Its N. W. fide is much 
damaged by the breaking of fand banks. Pabbay lies about 
a league N. W. of Berneray, is of a conical appearance, and 
riles to a peak confiderably higher than any part of the other 
iflands in the Sound. Its greateft diameter may meafure 
about 2i miles. This ifland was once the granary of Harris, 
but it has loft much of its fertility by the encroachment of 
the fand drift, which now covers its S. E. fide to the very 
top, exhibiting a moft defolate appearance. The S. W. fide 
is verdant, and well cultivated. The N. W. fide, expofed to 
the Atlantic, yields little or no vegetation, the fprjy of the 
fea in ftormy weather warning over it. Within iL league 
E. from Berneray, lie the iflands of Calligray and Enfay, fe- 
parated from each other by a narrow Sound, called Caolas 

Scaire t 



of Harris. 345 

fteire, through which the tide paffes with the mod impetu- 
ous current known about thefe coafts. Thefe hlands he m a 
line from S. to N. along the S. W. end of Harris. The inter- 
mediate opening is moft commonly called the Sound of Har- 
ris, and is moft frequented by (hipping. Calligray is about 2 
miles long, and a mile broad." The S. end is a deep fools 
and for the moft part uncultivated ; the N. end .a fandy foil 
well cultivated. To the northward of this, ifland lies Enfay, 
In fize and fhape nearly the fame as Calligray, being verdant 
all over, and having a good foil well -cultivated. 

Of the uninhabited iflands belonging to the fouthern divi- 
sion, fome are of confiderable extent : A few of them may 
meafure a mile in length, and about half a mile in breadth. 
They are covered with heath and mofs, and afford pretty 
good lummer pafturage. The fhores are lined with lea- weed. 
The people of the four iflands, already defcribed, repair to 
them with their families and cattle, in the feafon of kelp- 
manufaauring. Here moft of them get peats for fuel, there 
being no mofs in any of the inhabited iflands of this diftricl, 
excepting Calligray ; and, to procure this ncceffary article, 
fome of them have to go through a moft dangerous naviga- 
tion, the diftance of almoft three leagues. The names of 
the largeft ifles are Hermitray, Hulmitray, Saartay, Voter- 
fay, Neartay, Opfay, Vaaklay, Haay, Suurfay, Torogay, 
Scarvay, Lingay, Groay, Gilifay, Sagay, Stromay, Skeilay, 
Copay. There is, befides thefe, a vaft number of iflets, 
holmes, and high rocks, for each of which the people have 
names. It is remarkable, that as the names of the larger ifles 
terminate in ay, fo the names of thefe raft generally terminate 
in em y e.g. Tuem, Cuadem, Coddem, &amp;c. From an emi- 
nence near the Sound may be had a very curious view of the 
odd intermixture of land, rock, and water, which fills the 
fpace betwixt the mainland of Uift and the mainland of Har-

Here the tide riles to a great height ; the current runs with 
amazing rapidity ; the furge, wlun the wind biows agamft 
the tide, fwells prodigbufly ; and the roar of the breakers, 
foaming over the banks and fhoais to an immenfe diflance, 
feems to threaten the ifland.rs with a general deluge. In 
winter ftorms, the view is tremenduous and grand beyond 
the power of defcription. One would hardly expert to find 
a fafe courfe of navigation through luc'i a Sound j yet the 
writer hereof recollects to have counted in one day upwards 
of fixty fail of herring quffes, which found their way through 
it without an accident, bound northward to the Loch R ogue 
fifhing. He has even feen fome fhips of burden, whicn w -re 
driven in by ftormy weather from the Weftern Ocean, pilot- 
ed in fafety, by the people of the iflands, through this leem- 
iDgly impervious courle. 

2. Defcription of the Mainland of Harris within Tarbert. 

This track of country extends from the Sound to Tarbert, 
a length of 15 miles. At the fouthern extremity, its breadth 
is about 6 miles : It narrows gradually, but irregularly, towards 
the middle of this region ; and from thence widens again to- 
wards the ridge of mountains that overhangs Tarbert, where, 
computing from the head lands on the W. coafl: to thofe on 
the E. the breadth may be about 8 miles. The whole of 
this diftrict is mountainous and rocky, excepting the W. 
coaft, which is moftly bordered with a ftripe of plain ground, 
and covered with verdure almofl: to the tops of the hills.

The E. coaft is indented all along with harbours, bays, and 
creeks, ami exhibits to a fpectator at fea the moft barren a£. 
pect, appearing to be a continued bare rock Near the fhore, 
however, a few green patches are to be feen, brought into 
culture by laborious induftry of ihe inhabitants, in the 
manner hereafter to be described. The country is inhabited 
along the fhore on each coalr. The intermediate Jpace is a 
wild uncultivated common. Within this diftnct on the W. 
coaft are two large tracts of fand, covered by the lea at high 
water only. One of them k circular and upwards of 4 miles 
in circumference; the other is oblong, about i^- mile long, 
and a mile broad. The inlet to each from the fea is narrow 
but deep. The procefs of recovering them would be hazard- 
ous and expeniive ; but were they brought into culture, they 
would be more valuable than all the arable lands in this dii- 
tricT of Harris befides. The names of the. principal farms in 
this divifion appear to be Norwegian, e. g. 8carafta, Borough or 
Borvc, Nifaboft, Horgaboft, Siielaboft.

the Country of Lewis, is called the Foreft, though without 
a tr ee or even a fhrub, becaule it is the refort of the deer, 
and is ailedged to have been a royal foreft. It begins at the 
narrow ifthmus, called Tarhert, which connects this divifion 
of the mainland of Harris with that already defci (bed This 
Ifthmus, about \ mile broad, feparates the two largeft har- 
bours in Harris, which approach it in op ofite directions, and 
are called Eaft and Weft Loch-Tarbert. Its e -.tent from S. to 
M fcarcely equals its breadth ; and the m untains on each, 
fide being high, fteep, and barren, it appeal a deep, dark, 
horrid gulph. The Foreft, bounded E. and W. by the op« n

fea, and on the N. by the two great harbours of Loch-3ca- 
forth and Loch Refort, feparated at the Lewis march by an 
ifthmus of about 6 miles, is fomewhat of a triangular fpace, 
forming a very obtufe angle at Tarbert. The diftance from 
Tarbert, along the W. coaft to the mouth of Loch-Refort, 
is i3 miles. From Tarbert to the mouth of Loch-Seaforth, 
the diftance may be called 7 miles. Proceeding in a ftraight 
courfe from Tarbert to the Lewis march, if we may be allow- 
ed to fuppofe a ftraight courie practicable through the inter- 
vening obflacles, the diftance may be called 10 miles. This 
mountainous region refembles a number of fugar loaves placed 
on their bafes in contact with one another and broken at top 
into the various forms of peaks, protuberances, and excre- 
fcences; perhaps the rudeft fpecimen of nature's workmanfhip. 
The general appearance is rocky, but there is fome coarfe 
pafture in the valleys, and in the interfaces of the rocks along 
the fides of the mountains. Along the weftern fliore there 
are a number of creeks, and inlets of the fea, moft of them 
commodious harbours, at each of which a colony of tenants 
has been placed, who contrive, by a wonderful exertion of 
induftry, to rear as much barley, oats, and potatoes, as ferves, 
with the help of their fifhing and other earnings, to fupport 
their families. Towards the northern extremity of this fliore, 
there is one fi rm, called Hulkinifh, which contains fome 
extent of arable land, being a rich mixture of black earth and 
fhell fand. The eaftern fliore is alfo inhabited by a fet of in- 
duftrious tenants, who cultivate a foil of the moft forbidding 
afpeft, fo are fome patches along the fides of Loch Refort 
and Seaforth. 

The Northern Ifles inhabited are, Taranfay, Scalpay, and 
Scarp. Taranfjy is a high rocky ifland, about 4 miles long 
and 1 broad, lying in a weftern direction from the mouth of 
Weft Loch Tarbert. Scalpay is a low, heath covered, round 

ifland

ifland in the entrance to Eali Loch Tarjjerfc. Its land dimen- 
ficns are not £afily afcertained, iis p.-.rts being icarcely cohe- 
rent, through a lingular intervention of water lakes and arms 
of the fea jutting in through it in varioas directions. Its two 
extreme points from E. to W. may be computed 3 miles dis- 
tant. On the E. point is a light-houfe built in 1788 ; and near 
the weftern extremity are two of the belt natural harbours in 
the Hebrides: Mariners call it Ifle of Glafs. Scarp is a high 
round rocky ifland, one compact mountain, of which the 
diameter at the bafe maybe 3 miles. It is' fituated at the 
mouth of Loch Refort, and divided from Hufkinifh, already- 
mentioned, by a found fomewhat lefs than a mile broad as 
high water. 

Of the uninhabited iflands, belonging to this divifion, feve- 
ral fmall ones are placed round the bays and harbours cf 
Scalpay, and along all the creeks of the E. coaft of Harris,, 
There is one in Eaft Loch Tarbert, called Skeotifvay, about 
a mile long. In the W. loch is a long flat one called Ifayj 
farther W. along the foreft fhore are two called Soay. With- 
in Scarp, at the mouth of Loch Refort, is a flat one called 
Fladday. All thefe names appear to be Danifh. Four leagues 
N. W. from Taranfay is a large green ifland called G'aaikcir, 
which is a Gaelic name, flgnifying the rock of geefe. It is 
frequented by vaft flocks of wild geefe. The gentleman 
who pofTefTes it in tack, ufed for many years to fend to it, 
from the ifland of Taranfay, 1 2 heifers and a bull about the 
1 2th of Auguft; and they were brought back in' high order 
early in June, each cow having a calf. One year the whole 
flock perifhed ; and, to whatever caufe the change may be 
imputed, it is certain the paflure is now fo far degenerated, 
that it affords but fcanty feeding to about 12 fheep of a very 
fmall fiae.

Soi/, Produce, and Syjlent of Formings—The country of 
Harris can never be enriched by agriculture. The foils now 
IP culture are, generally fpeaking, poorj a^d of the wafte 
lands the far greater part will entirely baffle the ar L of the huC 
bandman for ever. The rude inhabitants of the rocky and 
mountainous regions have attempted tillage with amazing fuc- 
cefs, in places where an experienced farmer of a more favour- 
able clime could never think of turning a fod for the pur- 
pofe of railing a crop. The quantity of land throughout the 
whole parifh, which can be called properly arable, e. to be 
turned with the plough, is very inconfiderable, in proportion 
not only to the extent of muir and wafte lands, but to the 
quantity otherwife contrived to be tilled. The plough lands 
are confined to the four Southern Ifles. (none of which, how- 
ever, is altogether arable) fome fields of fandy foil on the weft 
fhore of Harris within Tarbert, fome in Hulkinifh, and a 
fmall patch, perhaps 10 acres, m Taranfay. Thefe lands are 
laboured with a common Scotch plough and feathered lock, 
drawn by four horles ; and immediately fown and harrowed, 
fometime betwixt the ift of April and 12 of May. Weak 
Hubble ground, manured with fea-weed, which is caff afhore 
in May, is fometimes ploughed down fo late as thr 1 oth or 
1 2th of June, and yields excellent barley. Of all thefe lands 
the foil is in general fandy ; that efpecially which lies neareft 
the fhore, from whence the fand is perpetually drifted by 
high winds, is pure fhell, ground very fine, in which the 
eye can fcarcely difcern a particle of earth. Towards the lat- 
ter end of fpring it gets a ftrong furface ; and, when plough- 
ed without manure, it yields a thin crop of fmall black oats, 
the ftalks of which feldom rile above a foot from the ground. 
Towards the rifing grounds the foil improves, being a mix- 
ture of black earth and fand, in which the corn rifes much 
higher, and grows cloie. When manured, both foils, if the 

fummer 



of Harris* 35 1 

£imraer be fhowery, yield rich crops of barley. The ma- 
nure chiefly tiled is lea-weed, of which great quantities arc 
en ft alhore by the winter ftorms in the South Iflands, in a 
few places on the welt of Harris within Tarbert, and in Ta- 
ranlay. The quantity of dung made is confiderable, owing 
to the fhortnels of the Itubble, and the cattle confuming the 
ftraw in winter provender, There is neither marl nor lime 
ftone in the country, not in the whole long ifland. Black 
earth and peat duft are ufed iuccefsrully as manure, on a few 
fpots purely fandy. In the ifland of hnfay only, there is fome 
extent of wet clayey ioil arable, and it is not reckoned among 
the moft productive. The only other kind of foil in the 
South Ifles is a black mould, generally deep, which, when well 
manured with lea wr. d and tilled in lazy-beds, is by far the 
moft productive On this ground, the {hell fand, with which 
the fea coaft abounds, would, without doubt, aniwer as a ma- 
nure, and its effects would, in all probability, be more per- 
manent than thole of fea- weed, which feems to give only a 
temporary ftimulus to vegetation, without enriching the foil j 
but it has not been yet tried, for want of cart roads to lead it 
up ; and the grounds are lo Iteep, rocky, and uneven, where 
this ioil prevails, that it will be difficult, in the future pro- 
grels of improvement, to accompliih this defirable object. 
There is upon two farms, called Rowdile and Strond, at the 
S. extremity of the mainland of Harris, a red loamy foil, 
by far the richeit in the parilh, which has not yet been 
brought to that decree of cultivation it might admit of. It 
is tilled in lazy-beds ; but if drained and cleared of ftone, 
which is by no means impracticable, the greatefl: part of it 
might be turned with the plough. The foil moft prevalent 
in Harris is a kind of black earth, of firm cohefion, with a 
ftrong furface, which is thin over the rocks, and on the de- 
clivities, but very deep and much of the nature of mofs, in 

the 



3 5 2 StatijVcal Account 

Che low ami fwampy grounds. The only fpecies of tillage 
adapted to this Toil, whce thin and fcanty, is that of the 
lazy-bed; and, where it is fwampy, a confiderablc expence 
of previous draining and trenching is requifite to bring it into 
arable land. Something, no doubt, might be done in this 
branch of agricultural improvement ; but few attempts have 
yet been made, partly through the predile&amp;ion of the people 
in favour of the ancient fyftem of management, and partly 
through want of encouragement from the proprietors. Deep 
black mofs is the only foil to be found along the eaft coaft, 
and on the forefl fhores. It is curious to obferve how the 
inhabitants of thefe creeks labour to cultivate it. The firfb 
•operation in this tedious procefs is cutting of the fea-ware for 
manure, each colony having a portion of fhore allotted to it 
for this purpole, by the proprietor or principal tackfman of 
whom it holds. This is done at low water, in fpring tides, 
by the tenants of each creek, in common, and led up in creeks 
on men's backs above flood mark, in as many heaps as there 
are tenants on the farm ; for which heaps they afterwards 
caft lots, and each carries his fhare on his back to his own 
ground, which alfo has been previoufly affigned him by lot. 
Not only the poornefs of the pafture, but the ruggednefs of 
the ground difables him from keeping a horfe, to lead the 
manure to his ground ; for he often has it to carry through 
paths entirely impaffible by the country gearrans, though they 
are perhaps the beft climbers of their kind in the world. 
Having thus carried up his fhare of the fea-ware, he fpreads 
it very thick on the furface of a nr.rrow rigg, difpofed as the 
nature of the ground (than which nothing can be imagined 
more irregular) may chance to admit, either in a ftraight, 
circular, ferpentine, or zig-zag dire&amp;ion, round the interven- 
ing rocks, pools, or bogs. Then he begins to labour with 
bis cafdireach, an implement of hufbandry like that known 

.in 



of Harris, 



353 



Jn fome parts of the fouth of Scotland by the name of the 
lugged fpade. With this he cuts in the furrow all the turf, 
fit for his purpofe, that he can colled:. The clods fo cut are 
taken up by the hands of a fecond perfon, ^ho lay? thent 
clolely over the manure on the rigg. If he cannot afford to 
employ a couple more hands on the oppofire fids of the rig, 
he iTiUrt go round it, thus cutting and laying on the fod till 
all is covered. As the furface is very hrong, and the ibil by 
nature abfolutely barren, an immenfe quantity of fea-weed 
is neceffary to force from it a tolerable crop. It generally" 
takes no lefs than 200 large creel-fulls, if not mixed with dung 
or any other compoft, to yield a boll of barley, or if fowa 
with potatoes, which is the raoft ordinary as well as the mod 
beneficial crop railed in thefe creeks, about 12 or 14 barrels. 
The lazy-bed, thus roughly covered with fuch fod or turf as 
the ground affords, is left in this ftate till the time of low- 
ing, generally very late in the fpring ; when, previous to its 
receiving the feed, another operation of confiderable labour is? 
found neceffary to pulverife it, that is, breaking down the 
rough clods with a heavy kind of hoe, which, in the tougheft 
parts of the foil, takes up nearly as much time as the firffc 
operation of covering the lazy-bed. Then the feed is fown ; 
if with barley, pretty thin •, if with potatoes, the cuttings are 
planted, with a dibble, not many inches alunder. The finifli- 
ing operation is the harrowing, which is done with a hand 
rake, having fix timber teeth and a handle about 2 feet long. 
In the whole of this procefs, the men are generally affifted by 
their wives and all their children above 12 years old. The 
pidlure above drawn of the arduous labour of lazy-bed culture, 
holds true in refprcl to every other place through the pa- 
rifh, where the ground does not admit of being ploughed, 
with this exception, that the manure is led no, and the har-

rowing performed by means of horfes, wherever the nature 
of the ground permits them to be ufed. 

The farmer, who toils fo hard for bread, would furely re- 
quire ample returns to compenfate his labour. There are 
fome inftances of a lich increafe from this mode of cultiva- 
tion, but the vaft expence of timt and labour beftowed on 
the ungrateful foil in which it is ufed,. cannot by any means 
be faid to be generally repaid. The returns from barley feed 
are in a good year from 1 6 to 20 fold. An inftance has oc- 
curred, under the immediate experience of the writer here- 
of, in which a piece of old ground, richly manured with fea. 
weed, and tilled in the cQmmon lazy-bed way, being fown 
with fomewhat lefs than 10 pecks of barley-feed, bear mea.- 
fure, produced 24 bolls of grain 5. and this grain was fo round 
as to yield in meal, for every boll, very near five firlcts. But 
fuch an inftance may not occur in 50 years. The ground 
was prepared with extraordinary attention, and the feafon was 
remarkably favourable. The returns of potatoes are from 8 
to 10 fold only. Thefe are the only kinds of crop fown in 
the lazy-bed, the year in which the manure has been laid on. 
After this, it yields two fuccefiive crops of fmall blaGk oats, 
firft producing a fourfold increafe, but degenerating as the 
flrength of the manure declines. For oats, the lazy-bed is 
broken down^ to one fide, and delved with an inftrument cal- 
led the cafchrom or crooked fpade. When the third year's 
crop is taken, the ground is let out of culture, and yields 
good natural grafs, excellent fummer pafture for 3 or 4 years.; 
after which it gradually reverts to its original fterility, till it 
is brought again into culture as above. I he grafs is the main 
objeft for which the farmer labours. It is not for the beft re- 
turns yielded by his crops of corn that he is at all the toil and 
trouble above defcribed, but chiefly to lay in a ftore of win- 
ter provender for his cattle, and to improve £heir fummer

pafture, by meliorating the natural barrennefs of the foil as 
far as circumftances will permit. Could thefe ends be other- 
wife obtained, no corn crops ought to be at all raifed here, 
efpecially on any of the lands unmanageable by the plough.; 
for though no people labour harder, beginning this dreary 
procefs fo early as the month of November, and continuing 
it occafionally, as the weather permits, as the caft of fea ware 
may chance to come, and as the necefTary attention to their 
cattle and to the other branches of hufbandry allows them, 
till the month of June ; yet the whole produce of the three 
crops, barley, potatoes, and oats, may be fairly eftimated at 
little more than 2000 bolls, Linlithgow meafure, even in the 
beft of years ; and in bad years the crops fail fo miferably as 
to yield little more than the feed requifite for the next fow- 
ing. They are more frequently blafted by the feverityof the 
weather .in their progrefs towards maturity, than fhaken fully 
ripe by autumnal frorms ; at the fame time they are liable to 
this laft hazard alfo, fhould they have efcaped the firft. The 
autumnal equinox is almoft invariably attended with a tem~ 
peft ; but the farmers are generally fo provident as to have 
their corns cut down, even if they fhould not be thoroughly 
ripe, before this comes on. In reaping the barley, a large 
proportion, that efpecially which grows on the ftrong lazy- 
bed grounds, is plucked up by the roots, and tied up in 
fneaves, of which 12 are generally placed clofe together in a 
row to dry on the ground. The ftubble is afterwards cut off 
with a fickle, and the barley built up in ftacks. This mode 
of reaping may be challenged as barbarous. It is, however, 
vindicated on the plea of neceffity. This kind of ftubble is 
the only fort of thatch the people can procure for their houfes. 
The oat ftraw grows but fhort, and affords the cattle hut a 
fcanty fubfiftence of provender at the beft. There is no fern 
in the parifh ; and the heather fit for thatch is at the djftance

of many miles from molt of the farm houfes ; befides, it may 
admit of a doubt, whether this operation, as is conceived, 
hurts the ground. May it not rather be reafonably fuppofed, 
that the itrong rough fod, which covers the lazy-bed, being 
thus laid bare for the winter feafon, and lelt expofed to the 
fertilizing action of fun, wind, and froft, is the better pre- 
pared for the next year's tillage and feed : On every farm 
there is a kiln for drying the corn. There is no public mill 
in the parilh. The principal tackfmen have a luiall one of a 
fimple conftruclion, each on his own farm ; and the lo\. er 
orders of tenantry make fhift to grind their corn by means of 
quairns, i. e. a couple of light milnltones fet in motion with 
the hand by means of a (faff fixed in the upper ftone. This 
expedient is ulcd over a great part of the highlands, in places 
far removed from corn mills. All the bread, thus arduoufly 
procured, is generally confumed before the month of June ; 
and fuch as cannot then afford to purchafe imported meal, 
fubfiO- chiefly on the milk of their cows and fheep, with what 
fifh they may chance to catch, till their wants are relieved by 
the firft fruits of their potatoe crops early in harveft. The 
produce of his black cattle is the chief fupport of the farmer. 
Excepting kelp, this may be faid to be the only faleable com- 
modity by which the rents are paid. Whatever other articles 
may be produced, are found barely fufficient for the fupport 
of his family. The cows are of a lelfer fizeand poorer qua- 
lity than thofe of Sky and the Continent; but they are a hardy 
breed, and might be confiderably improved by paying more 
attention to the rearing of the young ftock, and fecuring 
the paftures with better inclolures. They are fold in f:: , ill 
lot? from each farm to drovers, who ferry them to the Ifle of 
Sky in the month of July; and from thence they are driven 
to market, fometimes to the S. of Scotland, but more fre- 
quently to England. Though there may be in all Harris 

about

about 900 milk cows, fuppofed a breading flock, yet the 
numb./ annually fold to drovers does not exceed 200. Un- 
doubtedly a greater number fit for fale might be reared, were 
the paftures properly fecured, which of all the other objects 
of farming ought to be mod attended to. Of this the people 
■arc becoming daily more fenlible ; but ftill a number or inve- 
terate prejudices obtain in favour of old ufages, which will taKe 
fome time to be entirely eradicated. Cows, fheep, and hor- 
fes, are too often allowed to feed promifcuoufly. The inclo- 
fures are too few, and thefe few are very bad. The com- 
mons are by far too extenlive ; tor of the great extent, (in 
mott inllances of ieveral hundred acres; which a tackfman 
nominally pouVilet, ail that he can call his own, is only a 
ftripe along the lea fhore, about a mile broad, fenced with a 
wretched feal dyke, rarely lufncient to fecure his growing 
corn againft the depredations of the cows and horfes that feed 
on the commons beyond it, and fcarcely in one inftance nt 
to prevent the incroachment of fheep. The mode of tillage 
requires a vafl number of horfes, which ranging along with 
all the cows and fheep on a farm, over all the fencelefs paf- 
tures, through the winter and fpring quarters, down to the 
month of June, prevent the early vegetation both of corn 
and grafs. Upon the whole there mufl be a great refor- 
mation in the habits of the people, and in their fyftem of 
management, before the farming bufinefs, in either line of 
corn or cattle, can advance the country to any degree of 
profperity. 

Cows, Sheep, Horfes, £5V. — The number of breeding cows, 
above computed at 900, leads us to rate the whole number 
of b! k -atrle in the pa-ifh at 2460, i. e. the breeding flock, 
and its furvrving increafe at the end of three years. There 
is a vafl anference in the quality of thefe cows. Thofe rear-

ordinary cattle from 2 1. to 2I. 10 s. whilft others at their 
prime are lcarcely worth 1 I. It is but of late years that the 
prices have rifen even fo high. An ordinary cow, fold at 
Martinmas for (laughter, fetches in the country 2 1. Its beef 
will not fill a barrel, and its tallow feldom exceeds \ ftone ; 
but the meat is fat and delicious. 

The number of Cheep, confidering that there is none of 
the farms altogether laid out as a fheep walk, is great. Few 
of them are domefticated. They range unherded through 
the mountains and commons, where many of them are allow- 
ed to run wild, uncaught for years. Under thefe circum- 
flances it is not eafy to afcertain their number with any de- 
gree of precifion. Perhaps we may not be much above the mark 
by calculating it at 11,000. They are of fo diminutive a 
fize, that 10 or 11 carcafes are required to pack a barrel •, 
and 16 fleeces go to a ftone of wool. The wool is generally 
fhort, but very fine. The mutton is perhaps the mod deli- 
cate of its kind in the known world. The price of a fheep 
and lamb at Whitfunday is 3 s. 4d; ; the price of a full grown 
wedder or fat fheep at Martinmas is from 3 s. to 3 s. 6d. 
The price of wool, (which is but feldom fold,) is 8 s. the 
ftone unwafhed, or 10 s. when waflied. It is remarkable, 
that there has been but little variation in thefe feveral prices 
for 50 years back. All the wool is fpun and manufactured 
in the parifh. A few fine light fluffs are made, which are 
worn by the firft rank of the inhabitants ; the* lower ranks 
get their wool manufactured into coarfe, but decent clothing 
for themfelves. Some of the gentlemen are now introduc- 
ing the Galloway black-faced breed of fheep to their farms, 
which will no doubt increafe the quantity of wool and flefh ; 
but it is much to be doubted, whether the quality of either 
will be improved by the experiment.

The number of goats is inconfiderable, about 250. Their 
pricr i c the fame with that of Iheep. 

Of horfes the number cannot be laid down at lefs than 
1000. The common country breed is very fmall fized; but, 
when in good cafe, carry large loads, and are remarkably 
hardy. Their price has rifen very high within thefe few 
years. A fmall gearran,, bought about 10 years ago for le&amp; 
than 2 1. cannot now be purchafed for 3I. 3 s.; and the befii 
of them fell from 4 1. to 5 1. The gentlemen have a ftock 
of larger horfes on their farms, fit for drawing the plough 
and cart. Some of them have lately imported a few good 
beafts fit for the faddle ; and one gentleman has got a breed 
of afles, which he expects may prove ufeful in the produc- 
tion of mules. 

To the account of the grazing ftock, we add the number 
of deer in the forefr, and on the great commons of Harris 
within Tarbert, which we fuppofe to be at lead 800. Thefe 
belong to the proprietor of Harris, who employs one of the 
principal tackfmen as his forefter to prevent poaching. The 
deer are very deftructive to the corn and grafs of the tenants, 
whofe farms lie in the neighbourhood of the foreft and com- 
mons. Some of the uninhabited iflands in the Sound of 
Harris abound with rabbits, introduced fome years ago by 
the gentleman to whofe farm thefe ifles now belong. 

Kelp ManufaEture. — Kelp is the ftaple, and, excepting the 
few cows fold to the drovers, the only valuable article of ex- 
portation which the country produces. This manufacture 
is thought to be brought to its utmoft extent of late, in con- 
fequence of the high prices fome years ago, which encourag- 
ed the people to convert all the fea-ware produced by thefe 
fhores into kelp, regardlefs of the detriment to their corns 
and paftures, which have degenerated much through want

of the manure formerly afforded by the mores. All the fea- 
w.-ire, now ufed for manure, is fuch as is cart: afbore after the 
kelp-making fealbn is paft. In dry weather, any time from 
the month of April to the month of September, kelp maybe 
made of every weed which the fea produces. The people 
of Harris are very expert and indubious at it. The whole 
quantity now made amounts to 450 tons. The fhore; are 
held in tack along with the landed poffeffion. Tiie manu- 
facturers are paid at the rate of fo much per ton, according 
to the different fituations and difadvantages of the fhores. 
For the eafieft fhores the Ieaft paid is 1 1. 5 s.; for the more 
difficult from 1 1. 10 s. to il. 15 s. per ton. For manu- 
facturing fuch ware as is cut at low ebbs on funk rocks, 
which muft be ferried in boats to drying grounds at a 
diftance, there is in fome inftances paid from 2 1. 10 s- to 
3 h per ton. The introduction of this manufacture, exclu- 
five of its advantages to the tackfmen, has been a great blef- 
fing to the poorer tenantry, who, in the fummer quarter, 
have no other object on which their induftry can be profit- 
ably exerted. Yet its benefit does not extend to them fo far 
as might be wifhed ; as every kelp dealer is defirous to have 
his kelp made as early a poffi'ole, (that which is made early 
being always the beft,) the tackfmen, for the fake of expedit- 
ing the manufacture, portions out his fhores in fmall lots to 
as many manufacturers as he can find ; fo that for the moft 
part, the man who gets more than a ton for his lot may 
reckon himfelf lucky. In the South Ifles, and in a few other 
fituations, where the people have fummer grazing for their 
cattle, a man, affifted by his family, may make 4 or 5 tons 
in a feafon. We reckon 350 hands employed in this work, 
which, in a dry feafon, they finifh in the courfe of 5 or 6 
weeks. The employer fupplies them in meal, at as eafy a 
rate as it can be purchafedj and wtre it not that in a feafon

be generally enabled by their earnings, at the kelp-manufac- 
turing, to pay their land rents. The kelp is either fold to a 
merchant in the country, or fent to market at the rifk of 
the original owner. Some years ago, it fetched in the coun- 
try from 5 1. to 6 1. per ton. The price has been much on.

fall below the prefent rate, this manufacture muft be entire- 
ly given up here, as it will certainly be more profitable for 
the farmers to ule the fea weed as manure for their grounds.

c.mie an objeft of dcfire to the barbarous freebooters of the 
north, who, upon the decline of the Roman Empire, had fuc- 
ceffively ravaged all the kingdoms of Europe. They were of 
courfe alternately overrun by tribes of Scandinavians, Danes, 
and Norvegians from the 10th to the 1 3th century, till in 
1266 they were united under Alexander til. to the Scottifh 
monarchy. Among the firft of the Danifh invaders came 
that tribe, or clan, of which one branch has for feveral cen- 
turies held the property of Harris. The chief of this branch, 
who has been varioufly defigned Macleod of Macleod, Mac- 
leod of that ilk, and Macleod of Harris, derives his pedigree 
from Magnus King of Norway, and latterly from the petty 
kings of Man. Two brothers Lodius, or Leod, and Turkill, 
or Torkill, the progenitors of two branches, who, to this 
day, idly contend for the nominal honour of the chieftainfhip,

ten, and as it fhould ft ill be written according to the ortho- 
graphy of the Gaelic language, Leodhus, i'o denominated as 
the habitation of Leod. During the turbulent period of the 
Danifh invafions, the two families found means to extend 
their dominions far throughout the W. of Scotland and the 
Hies. Some of their defcendants obtained fettlements alfo in 
the W. of England, in Wales, and in Ireland, who have 
taken the names of Lloyd and Floyd. We read of a Mac-

Lewis, chief of the branch difcended from Torkill, forfeited 
his property. Some gentlemen of the family, however, have 
retained a confiderable portion of the ancient inheritance. 
The principal of thefe are, Macleod of Raafay in Invernefs- 
fhire, and the Macleods of Cadboll, and Geanies in Rofs*. 
Macleod of Macleod, or Harris, has preferved, though not 
the whole of his hereditary pofiefllons f, a very extenfive pro-

* It appears from a note now in my pofleflion, under the fig- 
nature of '« the Chevalier de Mackleot', dated at Lifle Novem- 
ber 12. 1787, that a confiderable family of this name, whether 
of the Macleods of Lewis or Hanis it is not now material to in- 
quire, has been fettled in France fince the year 1530. The note 
gives a genealogical account of the family down from a George 
Macleod, Lfq; who, by letters patent from King Robert II. of 
Scotland, dated 5th December 1388, obtained a gift,.6f certain 
lands in the county of Tweeddale, forfeited by Humphrey El- 
phinllon, for his adherence to the interells of Richard, King of 
England. Thefe lands were bellowed on George VJacleod for 
fervites rendered in the patriotic caufe, and particuhuly for hav- 
ing diftinguifhed himfelf at the battle of Otterburn. On this 
polTellion the family flounfhed ior near two hundred years. The 
progenitor Of the branch fettled in France was David Macleod, 
who went ova about the middle of the 16th century in quality 
of gendarme of the Scottish guard. Since 1560 chey have been 
fettled in the duchy of Lorraiue. The prefent head of the fami- 
ly is Jean Nicolas de Mackleot, Seigneur de Terrcigne Pierville, 
Ville Foreft et Soumazeur, before the late revolution gentil- 
homme ordiaaire du Roi. 

+ Notwithstanding that the immenfe eftates of the Hebridian 
chiefs, generally acquired by right of conqueit, during the Dan- 
ifh invafions and the fubfequent feuds of the clans, which the 
powers of a feeble government were not able to reftrain, have, 
in the lapfe of time, been fplit down into lelTer properties, we 
cannot help thinking that the great extent, as yet remaining in 
the power of a lew families, is extremely prejudicial to the in-

perty in Sky, and the barony of Glenelg. The eftate of 
Harris was fold by Colonel Macleod of Macleod, in 1778, 

to 

lands and Iflands a degree of ariftocratical influence entirely in- 
compatible with the liberty of Britifh fubjects. While the mu- 
tual attachment of the chieftains and their clans fubfifted, this 
evil was neither felt nor complained of. The chief reigned in 
the hearts of his vaflals, who bore his exactions, and followed his 
fortunes with ' zeal and alacrity At that time his object was 
men, now it is money. The inhabitants of thefe countries had 
then a degree of fecurity in their pofTeflions, arifing from claims 
either of kindred or fervices to the chief. Now they confider 
thtmfelves as mere birds ©f paflage. When a tenant is difpoffef- 
fed, in confequence of t he proprietors demanding more rent than 
he is able' to pay, or, as has often happened, in revenge of a 
flight offence, to which an unguarded fpirit of independence, 
deferving better treatment, may have led, he has no refource 
left him but to emigrate out of the kingdom. It happens, in 
fact, that the sera at which the leafes expire on one of thefe 
great eftates, (if indeed there be leafes granted upon it), proves 
almoft invariably an aera of emigration ; and, without entering 
into a difagreeable detail of the various circumftances in the con- 
duct of proprietors, which ferve to produce this periodical de- 
population, the undeniable exiftence of the fact is, we appre- 
hend, fufHcient to eftabiifh a pofition of ferious importance, hum- 
bly fubmitted to the confideration of an impartial public, viz. 
« that the ftate of thefe countries can never be effectually im- 
• proved, nor the moll valuable interefts of the inhabitants pro- 
' perly fecured, while the people are left entirely dependant on 
« the power of a few felfifh individuals.' 

Among the multitudes who groan under the fevere exadtions 
of thefe arbitrary chieftians, there is one defcription of people 
whofe deftiny is forely to be lamented by every man whofe 
breafl is fufceptible of any generous feeling; we mean the high- 
er order of tenants, a fet of men who have every claim to the 
appellation of gentlemen, though now, too generally, fecluded 
by the untoward circumftances of their fate, from that degree 
of independence in their native land, to which their birth, fpirit, 
and education, fo juftly entitle them. Moft of them are defen- 
dants of different branches of the chieftian's family, originally 
fettled in patrimonial pofleilions on the eftate. Many of thefe 
poiTeffions had devolved in regular fucceflion from father to fon, 
through a long courfe of ages, on the prefent race of gentlemen,

to Alexander Macleod, Efq; a native of this parifb, and a re- 
lation of the chief j who, having acquired an ample fortune 
in the Eaft India Company's fervice, retired, in his latter 
days, with the generous and patriotic intention of beftowing 
it on the improvement of his native land. The prefent pro- 
prietor of Harris is his fon, Alexander Macleod, Efq; now in 
India, holding a polt of considerable conlcquence in the civil 
department of the Company's fervice, a young gentleman of 
excellent character, and of whom much is expected in for- 
warding the beneficent purpofes of his worthy father. The 
tackfmen of Harris hold their lands, as yet, under the leafes 
granted by the late Macleod of Macleod. They have had 
full fecurity in their poifeffions, which have been handed, 
down to moft of them through a long line of anceftory, and 
have hitherto lived well. Some of the leafes laft granted 
were for 38 years, of which there are 18 yet to run. Thofe 
granted for 19 years expired at Whitfunday laft, 1792. But 
the people were continued in their refpec~tive pofieffions on 
paying a moderate augmentation of rent. 

The 

holding leafes of their paternal inheritance from the chief for 
19 years, and in fome inftances for a* much longer term. But, 
whatever the time granted by the leafes might have been, there 
was little hazard of alienating the polfeffion, till the bafe third; 
of money had abforbed every consideration of friendship and at- 
tachment in the brea:l of the proprietor. In confequence of this 
unbounded avarice, however, thofe gentlemen in the Highlands 
and islands, whofe leafes have run out wiihin the laft 50 years 
have, in general, experienced as little lenity from their chiefs as 
the meaneft of their cottagers. On fome eftates, indeed, a de- 
fign feems to have been laid for their total extirpation. ' Many 
of them were driven to the neceffity of feeking refuge in the 
wilds or America; whilft others, obliged to fubmit to the terms 
of their oppreuors, are in the broad way of finking their pofteri- 
ty into a ttate of poverty, insignificance, and contempt. On a 
few eftates, both the higher and lower orders of tenantry have 
experienced a milder treatment. 



Stati/lical Account 



The whole of this eftate, like moft other eftates in the He- 
brides, is occupied by three different orders of tenants; ift, 
•principal tackfnien or gentlemen - t 2d, l'mall tenants; 3d, 
cotters. 

The common and ancient computation of lands in thefe 
countries is by pennies, of which the fubdiviiions are halfpen- 
nies, farthings, half farthings, clitigs, &amp;c. Of thefe a „en- 
tleman, according to the extent of his tack, pollt-fles a vaft 
■many, perhaps 20 pennies, perhaps many more. This rec- 
koning comprehends muir, pafture, and arable lands, for 
which the tackfman pays fo much yearly rent in the lump, 
during the currency of his leafe. Of this extenfive poffef- 
fion he may fubfet a third or a fourth. E'ch fub-tenant in 
Harris generally holds the divifion of a farthing, for which 
he pays, according to the fuppofed value of the lands, from 
20 s. to 40 s. in money, befides perfonal iervices, rated at a 
day's labour per week, to the principal tacklman. The per- 
fonal fervices of fo many fub-tenants are reckoned indifpen- 
fible under the prefent mode of management, in addition to 
the prodigious eftablilhment befides, of cotters and houfe- 
hold fervants, both male and female, which a gentleman fup- 
ports in order to carry on the common bufinels of the farm 
throughout the year. The fingle article of fuel coafts a vaft 
expence of labour. A gentleman, according to the number 
of fires his farm requires him to keep up, cuts of peats from 
30 to 50 irons, and the cutting of an iron employs four 
men ; the drying, flacking, and leading of them home re- 
quires an expence of hands in proportion. Repairing of the 
feal dykes and inclofures, a work of perpetual labour, weed- 
ing of corn, making of kelp, reaping of the different crops, 
hay, barley, oats, and potatoes in harveft, and the laborious 
tillage for railing thefe crops in winter and fpring, befides 
the thatching and repairing of houfes, tending and herding

the cattle, cows, horfes, and fheep, feparalely, with a great 
variety of other procefles in. this complex fyftem, all require 
fuch a multitude of fervunts, that a ftranger is naturally 
ftruck with aftonifhrnent ; red wonders how the produce of 
the moft 1 icrative farm is able to fupport the expence of fo 
large an eftablilh.nent of domeftics. If means were adopted 
for Amplifying the mode of management, the gentlemen of 
Harris would g'—'iy rekaie their fubtenants from the bondage 
of peribnal ierv^es, and at the fame time find themfelves re- 
lieved of a heavy incumbrance. They arc: generally humane 
and beneficent to thole whom providence has thus placed 
under them. Tney are accordingly loved and honoured by 
them. Under oppofite circumftances the power given them 
over the inferior order of tenants might juftly be deemed op- 
preffive ; and, wmle this lyflem is permitted to continue, a 
proprietor would do well to look to the character of the in- 
dividual to whom he confides, along with a large portion of 
his eftate, a large portion of its human inhabitants, the moft 
valuable flock, in every moral and political view, which can 
be preferved on any eftate whatever. 

It will perhaps excite the wonder of pofterity to know 
that the whole landed pofTefGon, of the three extenfive re- 
gions, herein defcribed under the title of Harris, was, down 
to the year 1792, excepting four fmall tenant farms holding 
immediately of the proprietor, in the hands of eight gentle- 
men farmers, on whom all the other inhabitants depend - t 
and that this diftribution is fo unequally proportioned, that 
two great farms comprehend more :han one half of the eftate. 

Tne principal tackfraen live here, as fuch generally live 
through the highlands and iilands. like gentlemen. They 
are for the moft part men of liberal education and polite 
breeding, They keep decent and refpeftable families. Their 
farms afford them plenty of the neceflanes of life, and many

of its comforts ; for which, as there is no market in the 
country, there is generally fufficient confumption found in 
the family through the largefTes of hofpitality, munificence, 
and charity, for which they are juftly celebrated. 

A fmall tenant farm is a little commonwealth of villagers, 
whofe houfes or huts are huddled clofe together with too 
little regard to form, order, or cleanlinels, and whofe lands 
are yearly divided by lot for tillage, while their cattle graze 
on the paftures in common. The fmall tenants in this coun- 
try, who hold immediately of the proprietor have leafes like 
the principal tackfmen, and pofTefs, fome a penny, fome half 
a penny, and fome a farthing, of lands. The ftock or foam- 
ing for the pafture of a farthing lar d is 4 milch cows, 3 or 
perhaps 4 horfes, with as many Iheep on the common as the 
tenant has luck to rear. The crops varv according to the 
different qualities of the farms, but may be computed in ge- 
neral at 4 or 5 bolls a farthing, for which the tenant gene- 
rally pays from 30 s. to 40 s. rent. This might be reckoned 
good pennyworth of lands ; but when it is confidered that 
the cattle of thefe tenants, miferably fed throughout the year, 
and often dying through mere want in the fpring feafon, are 
neither marketable nor yield much milk, befides that their 
crops are commonly infufficient to fupport their families for 
half the year, the poverty of this clafs of people in general 
is eafily accounted for. At the fame time moft of them live 
as well as people of their rank and occupation in other coun- 
tries j and fome more happily fituated than others live even 
in a comfortable ftile. In regard of living, the tackfmens 
tenants are on much the fame footing with thofe who hold 
the fame quantity of land of the proprietor, though in moft 
inftances they pay more rent and are removable at pleafure. 
Their common food is potatoes, fifh, barley or oat bread, 
milk, eggs, kail, fowls, and fometimes a little mutton or 

beef

beef falted for winter and fpring provifion. The induftriou3 
tenant, even of a farthing land, if not unfortunate, can have 
of all thefe a competency fuited to his rank, from the vari- 
ous produce of his little farm, from the fn ft of harveft to the 
laft of the fpring feafon, and m^y pay his rents by his earn- 
ings at fummer labour, either in manufacturing kelp or en- 
gaging in fuch other employ as he can procure. He may 
either purchafe from a mercnant, or rear on his own ground, 
fome coarfe flax, which is manufactured into iliirts and other 
linens for the ule of the family, by his wife and daughters, as 
their winter evenings amufement. In the fame manner is he 
cloathed warmly and decently from the fleece of his little 
flock. 

The third clafs of the people, whom we have denominated 
cotters, are tackfmens lervants, coniiantly employed in the 
labours of the farm. They have generally grafs, on the fame 
pafture with their matter's cattle, for one milch co'v with its 
followers, i. e. a three year, a two year, and one year old, a 
working horfe and breeding mare, befides iheep, in the num- 
ber of which they are feidoin reiincled, and a farthings di- 
vifion of land for corn and potatoes Wirh its proportion of 
fea-ware for manure. They have alfo a kail-yard, fuel, and 
a weekly allowance of a peck of meal. They are allowed a 
day in the week to work for themfelves, which, with the help 
of their families, is fufficient for railing and repairing their 
crops. A grieve, or ovevfeer, and grafs-keeper, if married 
men, and holding lands in lieu of wages, have more in pro- 
portion to the weight of the feveral charges committed to 
them. Having no rents to pay, arid being feldom under the 
neceflity of buying meal, unkfs the harveft prove very bad, 
they live on the whole better than the tenant of a farthing 
land.

Servants, Trade/men, Wages, tsf* There are a fet of coun- 
try regulations framed in the baron-bailie court, (the only 
court of juftice in the parifh) by which the wages of a fingle 
male fervant, (here called fcalag) employed in the bufmefs of 
the farm, were, fome time ago, fixed at 2I. a year, with four 
pair of fhoes ; and of women fervants employed in the fame 
work, at 6 merks Scotch, with two pair (hoes, and other 
fmall perquifites or gratuities, as they m?y merit at the hand3 
of the employer. Grieves, herdfmen, gr.ds- keepers, dairy- 
women, and chambermaids, may have double or triple thefe 
wages, according to the extent of their refpecYive charges. 
However, thefe regulations have gradually fallen into difufe, 
and the wages of fervants of every denomination have been 
on the rife for fame years paft. Some of the gentlemen's 
grieves have from 5 1. to 6 L. and upwards, with perquifites ' r 
and the fingle fcalags will not engage themfelves in fervice 
farther than for three quarters of the year, defirous to be 
free in the fummer quarter to undertake kelp manufacture, 
Or any job which chance may put in their way, fo that 
their annual earnings, befides feeding themfelves, may b&amp; 
rated at fomething more than 3 I. at an average. In fummer 
the gentlemen employ fome hands as day-labourers, when 
any piece of work is to be carried on feparate from the ordi- 
nary work of the farm, luch as building houfes or making 
dykes. In luch cafe, a common barrowman, or common 
dyker,. has, without victuals, from 8 d. to 9 d. per day, and a- 
more able hand 10 d. There is only one bred mafon in the 
country, ^and he not a native) who has is. 6d. in the long 
dav, and 1 s. when he works in winter. All other tradef- 
men, fuch as brogue-makers, taylors, carpenters, are fed by 
the employer in his houfe ; notwithstanding which, their 
charges are as high as they ought reafonably to be, even 
ikough they fed themfelves. Weavers are paid in meal for

iheir work. The parifh blackfmith has a falary rated at. 2 
pecks meal, or 1 s. in money from every farthing land, and 
is befides fed when employed. There are four other black, 
imiths in the country, who contrive to make, out a poor 
livclyhood by chance employ. There is one bred hhoemaker 
who ferves the gentlemen's families. The country leather 
is poorly tanned with the juice of the tormentile root, and 
made into brogues for the fcrvants and low tenantry. There 
are now 6 Hoops (fome time ago there were 9) employed in 
the kelp trade, fifhing, and other merchandifej for thefe hands 
are occafionally procured in the country. As their inlular 
fituation renders the lea in a manner their element, all the in- 
habitants on the fea-coft are, in fome degree, mariners. There 
is one cooper in confbnt employ with an apprentice. Of 
thofe who are occafionally employed as houfe or boat carpen- 
ters, the number exceeds 20, but moft of them are alfo far- 
mers. Ot ipinfiers and weavers, the number is almoft equal 
to that of houfeholders, among the lower clafs of people, 
whole wives and daughters both fpin and weave their wool 
into coarfe cloths for the ufe of the family, and a few blan- 
kets for (ale. There are befides 8 bred weavers who de- 
pend on employ from the gentlemen's families. All the gen- 
tlemen have gardens, producing cabbages, fallads, parlnips, 
carrots, &amp;cc. Turnips and onions rarely thrive, owing to a 
worm, generated in the hot fandy foil, which corrodes them 
in their progrtfs towards maturity. Thefe gardens are ma- 
naged under the inlpection of the owner, by fome of the 
farm fervants. They begin to raife a few fmall fruits. 

Rent. — The rent paid to the proprietor, before the expiry 
of the laft leafe, was 768 1. 2 s. 2 T %d. By the late agree- 
ment with the tenants, the neat amount of it will be 8881.

Natural Hi/lory — The natural hiftory of this country is, 
douhtlds, well worth the inveftigating through the feveral 
genera and fpecies belonging to the animal and mineral king- 
doms found in it. The prodigious variety of fowl and fifh 
with which its coafts abound, is particularly worthy of no- 
tice. But the writer of this account is not able to arrange 
them claffically, nor does he pretend to know even the com- 
mon names of many of them. 

Of fowl, befides the domeftic fpecies of hens, geefe, ducks, 
pigeons, and a few peacocks lately intrrduced, the molt re- 
markable are, muir-fowls, tarmagans, woodcocks, fnipes, plo- 
vers, eagles, hawks, crows, teals, curlieus, may-birds, bar- 
nacles, wild-geefe, folan-geefe, cormorants, fcarts ; and of o- 
ther fea fowl an indefinite number. Of fifh, the vaft num- 
ber of water lakes in this country abound with excellent black 
trout. Some good falmon likewife comes into the foot of 
the rivulets from fea, in and before the Ipawning feafon. 
Whales, and cearban. or faii-fifh, hover along the coaft in 
the fuinmer months ; feals in vah: abundance are to be feen 
throughout the year. The fea fi(h moft beneficial to the peo- 
ple are, the white-herring, dog-fifh, blind-fifh, cod, ling, 
fkait, mackerel, codlin, lythe, fythe, cuddy, fand-eel. There 
are fome oyfters and other fhell-fiGh. There are a number 
of chalybeate fprings ; fome copper and iron ore. The ftone 
every where throughout the country is excellent for build- 
ing. It is of various kinds ; the moft common is a hard 
blue whin of a beautiful glofs. In many places there is the 
beft of granite, admitting of a polifh as fine as any marble. 
There is neither marble, nor limeftone, nor freeftone, as yet 
difcovered. There can fcarcely be a doubt, that many foffil 
treafures are hid in the bowels of the lofty mountains, to be 
explored in future times. All that is remarkable, with ref- 
pect to the vegetable kingdom of nature is, that no tree 

grows 



of Harris, 

grows here, though nothing is more certain than that the 
country was once wooded all over. The gentlemen plant 
fome bulhes and fhrubs in their gardens, which fade as foon 
as they overtop the walls. 

A linguV r ueviation from the common courfe of the tides 
prevails in the Sound of Harris. The people fay (and will 
not be contradicted in their afferrion) that, from the autum- 
nal to the vernal equinox, the current, in neap tides, paffes 
all day from E. to W. and all night in the contrary direc- 
tion. That immediately after the vernal equinox it changes 
this courfe, going ail day from W. to E. and the contrary at 
night. In fpring tides the current correfponds more nearly 
to the common courfe of ebb;ng and flowing. Trie writer 
has fufficient experience to teltify the unaccountable irregu- 
larity of the tides in this found, but he has not been able to 
afce/tain, whether the fadt with regard to the neap currents 
be precifely fuch as is ftated, with fo much confidence, by 
the people. The moft deftrudtive procefs of Nature is, the 
continual wafting of the land on the weftern fhore, by the 
perpetual drifting of the fand, and the gradual incroach- 
ment of the fen. This is evinced by the clearefl teftimonies. 
Lands, which were ploughed within the remembrance of 
people yet living, are now no more. Wherever a high fand 
bunk has been entirely worn away, the loil under it is found 
to have been either a rich loam or black mofs. In many 
fuch fituations, veftiges of houfes, inclofures, churches, and 
burying grounds, appear. In the ifland of Pabbay, where 
the fea ebbs out in fpring tides to a great diftance, there are

Antiquities. — There are feveral monuments of Druidifm, 
correfponamg to the defcriptions or the places of worfhip 
Under this old eftablilhinenc giveu by antiquarians. On the 
mainland of Harris, in the diftric"t within farbert, there are 
two of the lame delcription within three miles of each other, 
one at Nifaboft, and the other at Borve. What now remains 
of each of thefe monuments coniifts of a long flat ftone, 
raifed on end perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, a- 
bout eight feet above the furface of the earth, and furround- 
ed by a circle, of fmaller ftones, placed on edge, of about 
io feet diameter. The great ftone is not quite in the cen- 
ter of the circle. Within a few yards of the one at Borve, 
there are clear veftiges of a circular building, which has ei* 
ther been a temple adjoining this clacban, or the refidence 
of the officiating Druids. One of thele monuments, in the 
Ifland of Berneray, is remarkable for its name, and varies a 
little from the above defcription. The principal ftoue is 
fomething of a conical figure, placed on the fmall end and 
flat above. Its height above the furface is not five feet. The 
circle which furrounds it, lefs in diameter than thofe already 
mentioned, is made up of long fharp pointed ftones, laid not 
very clofe together, but fo as that a man may pals betwixt 
every two. It is to this day called clock na greine, the ftone 
of the fun. It js well known that under Druidifm, which 
was a corruption of the ancient religion of the Magi, the deity 
was worfhipped as the effence of fire, and was defigned by 
the poets Grmaeus Appolk,

In the north end of the Ifland of Calligray, there are faint 
traces of a very ancient building, called Teampull na h'Annait 
I e. the temple of Annat, a goddefs mentioned by mythoio- 
gifts, as having for her particular province the care of young 
maidens Near this «.e nple is a well of water at which the 
worfhippers purified themfelves, called lobar na k' Innait, 
and the point of land on which it is fituated is called Ru. 
na b' Ami ait. 

Among the monuments of antiquity, we rank the Danifli 
forts, with which the whole cbaft of the Hebrides na ; - 
tern continent is lined, and of which there is here a confi- 
derable number. Thty fearcely deferve a particular enu- 
meration, and their general dcfcription is well known. Ihey 
are fituated on high eminences, and built in a circular form* 
of large fquare ftones ftrongly knit together without any ce- 
ment. Two of them are always placed in fight of each o- 
ther. They were ufed as fignal towers as well as fortrefles. 
The alarm of the firft appearance of the invading foe, being 
almoft inftantaneoufly communicated to the whole country 
by means of a fire lighted in the tower from whence the dan' 
ger was firft obferved, and immediately repeated by the next 
in view, till the communication ran ahnoft ab qu.ck as light- 
ening, through the whole chain. For this purpofe a centi- 
nel, called Gokmari, was continually kept on the highe!: part 
of the wall, whofe buffinefs it was., on efpying a fleet at '„ 
to light the fire, and the gohnati on dmy hi the fort im- 
mediately com unicating with this, inftantly repeated the; 
fignal. One of the largefl and moft co;dpicuous of theie 
forts is fituated in Borve o Borough, on the mainland of 
Harris* which, from this circumltnnce as well as the name* 
appear^ to have been, for Ibme time, the refidence of a bo- 
dy of Danifh marauders headed by a chief, it is pen .ble 
that in the Long ifland there are icveral places of this nai »

and that in each of thefi- there are Danifh forts of a more 
than ordinary fize. 

Befides the above mentioned monuments of Pagan and 
barbarous times, there are monuments of antiquity which 
deferve to be noticed with peculiar veneration ; decayed mo- 
numents of the piety of our Chriftian anceftors, which ought 
to caufe us blufh for our country in our degenerate days. In 
travelling through the Hebrides, and contemplating the re- 
mains of edifices confecrated to religious purpofes, which oc- 
cur to the view at almoft every mile's progrefs, the pious 
mind is affected with a mixture of awe and forrow, while it 
can hardly admit, that the overturning of the ancient church 
eftablifhment ought to be confidered as reformation here. In 
Harris, where, till within a few years back, there has not 
been, fince the aera of our reformation from popery, fo much 
as one comfortable or even decent houfe tor public worfhip, 
there were of old no lefs than 12 churches and chapels, of 
which the greater part of the walls, though fome of them 
be in a tottering condition, are yet. Handing, befides feveral 
others, probably of a more ancient date, which, having moul- 
dered away into heaps of rubbifh overgrown with mofs, may 
frill be traced, whilft tradition points out their fituations, and 
has carefully preferved their names. They were either de- 
dicated to faints or defigned after the names of their feveral 
patrons or founders. Of two, in the Ifland of Taranfay, one 
was called Teampull Che } and the other Eagluis Tarain. Tra- 
dition is totally filent in regard to both. Even of the names, 
as tranfmitted to us, the beft we can make is conjecture. 
The name of the lad ftrikes us as bearing a fimilitude to that 
of the ifland, which is, perhaps, derived from the fame ori- 
ginal. There is a St Tarnanus mentioned in the ancient 
Martyrology, who is called by Fordun, in the Scotichronicon, 
Tarananus, Archbifliop Uflier fays he was bifliop of Lif-

rare in Ireland, and in the early ages of Chriftianity planted 
many churches among the Scottifh and Pi&amp;ifh nations. Who 
knows but the church and Ifland of Taranfay may have ta- 
ken their names from him ? 

There is a ruin in the Ifland of Berneray, called, in the 
vitiated pronunciation of the people, Cill Aifaim, which, with- 
out doubt, flgnifies a cell or church dedicated to St Afaph. 
The churches of more modern date are cailed after faints, 
whofc names are well known,, in the Roman calendar, viz. 
St Bryde, St Rufus, St Luke,. St Mary. Ail thefe, together 
wjth the fmaller chapels belonging to them, depended im- 
mediately on the fj riory church at Rowdill, dedicated to St 
Clement. 

The firft foundation of this monaflery appears to be of a 
very ancient date. It is mentioned as one of the donations 
of King David I. the great benefaclor of the Scottifh church, 
to the canons regular of St Auguftine, and feems from this 
period to have depended on the Abbey of Holyroodhoufe, 
which was built and endowed by the fame King David, A. D. 
1123, in memory, as was pretended, of his efcape, from an 
enraged harr, by the miraculous interpolation of a crofs from 
Heaven. But many circumflances lead us to place the anti- 
quity of the religious houfe at Rowdill much high-;", though 
we cannot trace it up to the exact period of its foundation. 
It is evident that it could not have been founded by David 
at a time when the Kings of Scorland had no dominion in 
the Weflern lfles. It muft have been eftabl'dhed in the flou- 
rifhing times of Icolumkill, to which all the lands of Harris 
are faid once to have belonged; and the Clement, after whom 
the church is called, was molt probably fome eminent per- 
fon of that ancient feminary fent here as the firlt Chriflian 
rniflionary or refldent pallor, fainted only by the courtefy of 
after ages, in conference of the veneration in which his

name was held by the people. There are two of this name 
mentioned in our ecclefiallical hiftory. Both of them flou- 
rifhed in the eight century ; and, from the circuinftances re- 
corded of them, it is manifeft, that neither of them could 
have been canonized by the church of Rome. One of them, 
for ftruggling againft: the encroachments of Papal tyranny, 
was perfecuted, A. D 74 by Boniface Aiclibilhop of 
Mentz, and afterwards condemned both at Memz and at 
Rome; and the other was iracionfly entertained by the Em- 
peror Charlemagne, A. D. 784, while employed in writing 
the Caroline books againft the fecond council of Nice. This 
laft Clement is faid to have taught the firfr grammar ichool 
in Paris. It is moft likely that the firft mentioned Clem-nt, 
who, after his condemnation at Rome, fti'l adhering to his 
principles, would naturally retire to his own country, where 
Popilh doctrines were as yet unknown, was the perion who 
laid the foundation of the religious lemimiry at Rowdill, af- 
fifted by other Monks from Icolumkiii. The inftitution may 
be fuppofed to have flourifhed thenceforward in peace and 
profperity, till the period of the Danifh invafions, when the 
Monks deprived of their lands, and pent up within the walls 
of their convent in great diftrefs, the ravaged country afford- 
ing them no means of fubfiffence, would very naturally look 
up to fo pious a Monarch as David for aid and protection, 
under the calamitous circumftances to which they were now 
reduced ; and David, having perhaps relieved their neceflitics 
from the revenues of the newly inftituted Abbey of Holy- 
roodhcufe, laid the foundation of the claim of right, which 
the canons regular of St Augufline, in pofleffion of that Ab- 
bey, afterwards fubftantiated, when the Weftern Ifles became 
incorporated with the Scottifh kingdom. Thus we account 
for King David's pretended donation. Buchanan fays, the 
monaflery of Rowdill was built by Alexander Macleod of

Harris ; but this is an egregious miftake. The church of 
the monaftery was only repaired by this Alexander Macleod, 
who died, as the infcription on his touib bears, A. D. 1527. 
There is not a ftone left in the foundation of the priory. 
The place of it cannot now be traced, and all we furdy 
know of it is, that it once has been. The chartulary leems 
to have been loft amidft the devaluations, which every where 
marked the progrels of our firft reformers ; and the church 
was fet on fire. The walls, however, of this venerable pile 
remained almoft entire; and were repaired in 1784 by the 
late patriotic Alexander Macleod, Elq; of Harris. After the 
church was roofed and flated, and the materials for furnifh- 
ing it within laid up in it, to a conliderable value, it unfor- 
tunately took fire, at night, through the carelefTuefs of the 
carpenters, who had left a live coal in it among the timbers. 
So zealous, however, was this friend of religion and man- 
kind in prolecuting his defrgn of repairing it, that by his 
orders, and at his expence, it was, foon after this accident, 
roofed ; and it is now, though left unfiuifhed fince the time 
of his death, ufed as one of the principal places in the pa- 
rilh, for celebrating divine lervice. 

Eccleftaftkal State and Schools. — In this enormous parifh. 
there are leven ftated places of public woniiip ; the two near- 
eft each other being 9 miles diitaut, and the two fartheft re- 
moved 36. There is a miiEonary, lupported by the com- 
mittee of the General Allembly lor managing the royal 
bounty, fettled in the northern diftrivt, who has to officiate 
in three of thefe places. The hxed paftor has the other four 
to attend. There are two churches of ftone and lime with 
flated roofs ; the one repaired, and the other built, by the 
late Alexander Macleod, E%; of Harris. The itipend i?

glebe is let at 5 I a year. The prefcnt incumbent, Mr John 
Macleod, admitted 9th April 1779, accommodates himfelf 
with a comfortable farm houfe in lieu of a n.anfe. Mr Mac- 
leod of Harris is patron and fole heritor. 

There is a parochial fchooi at Rowdill, now attended by 
30 poor/childrenj the whole emoluments of which to the 
Ichoolmafter may be about 20 1. per an/win. There is a new 
fchooi foon to be fet up in another diftricl:, on the eftablifh- 
ment of the Society for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge, 
'lhe fame benevolent and patriotic fociety have already erect- 
ed at Rowdill a feminary of female induflry. Unfortunately 
the people of this country are fo detached from each other, 
that there is really no fixing on a ftation in which anyone pub- 
lic inlHcution can be of univerfal benefit. This circumftance 
in their local iituation, is one great caufe of the low ftate 
both of knowledge and induflry in which we find them. 
Hence it is, that even in religious knowledge, the molt im- 
portant of all, many of them muft remain deplorably defici- 
ent, while left dependent on the mmiftrations of one paftor, 
be he ever fo zealous and diligent, even though commonly 
afiided by the labours of a miflionary. It often happens 
that fome of the poor people in the outlkirts of the parifh, 
have no opportunity of hearing fermon throughout the whole 
vear, except when influenced to come to the place where 
the facrament of our Lord's Supper is ufually adminiftered. 
By an old Handing regulation, the people of the two fouth- 
ernmofl iflcs have a right to the attendance of the miniikr 
for public worfhip, only once a quarter ; and the accefs to 
thefe iflands, from the mainland of Harris, where he reudes, 
is fo difficult and precarious, that, in the winter feafon elpeci- 
ally, they are frequently difappointed. An inihnce, well 
authenticated, has occurred, in which one of the predecef- 
for c of the 1 relent incumbent, having gone to preach in the- 

Ifland

Ifland of Pabbay, was ftorm-ftaid there for feven weeks, 
to the great detriment of the reft of his parochial charge. 
As thefe iflands lie much nearer to, and are of eafier accefs 
from the mainland of North Uift, and as that parifh like- 
wife, under one paftor, is extremely populous and extenfive, 
it occurred to the vifitors, fent many years ago, by the Ge- 
neral Affembly of the Church of Scotland, to infpedt the 
ftate of religion in the Highlands and Iflands, that the north 
end of North Uift, with the Harris ifles of Berneray and Pab- 
bay, was a neceffary ftation for one of the new parochial erec- 
tions then intended. The fcheme of erections failed through 
want of means to profecute the defign ; but it has ever fince 
been an object with the prefbytery of Uift to get a miffion- 
ary to that ftation. The funds of the royal bounty being al- 
ready appropriated, there is no hope from that quarter. The 
late acceflion to, the funds of the Society for Propagating 
Chriftian Knowledge, fully enables them to accomplifh this 
defirable object j and their lecretary, having, in the courf'e of 
his late tour, feen and approved of the ltation, there was 
every reafon to hope for a fpeedy relief to the fpiritual exi- 
gence of the people. But by the regulations of the Society, 
no ftation is to be furnilhed with a teacher, unlefs the heri- 
tors, or other perfons having a permanent intereft in the 
bounds, co-operate by affording certain reafonable accomor 
dations for the inltitution. All that is required in this cafe 
is a church, and, for the miffionary, a houfe with a croft 
of arable and pafture land fufficient for the maintenance of a 
horfe and two cows. Repeated application has been made 
to Lord Macdonald, the principal heritor, hitherto without 
effect. Bur it is to be hoped, that his Lordfhip and Mr Mac- 
leod of Harris will, as foon as their feveral avocations permit, 
cordially -unite in promoting an inftitution of fuch obvious im- 
portance to the temporal and eternal interefts of their tenants,

Remarkable Chambers. — The lift of eminent names cannot 
be fuppofed to be long in this rude and feqneftrated clinic. 
Many of the lairds of Macleod have been celebrated for he- 
roic deeds and magnanimous conduct Among thofe of lat- 
ter date, we rank Ricari mor, Roderick the Great. He 
wrote Gaelic and Latin j but underftood not a word of Eng- 
lifh. His fubfeription was 'Smife MacUoid, I am Macleod. 
Two of his fons, Sir Roderick Macleod of Talifker, and Sir 
Norman Macleod of Berneray, were knighted in the field at 
Worcefter by King Charles the II. Sir Norman afterwards 
commanded a regiment in the Royal fervice, and was em- 
ployed on an important embaffy at the court of Denmark : 
After which he retired from public affairs, and lived in the 
ifland of Berneray. His magnificence and virtues afforded a 
theme of eulogy to the Hebridian mufe. 

There is an imperfect tradition of a per/on mor (great per- 
fon) who is faid to have been a great fcholar and a great tra- 
veller. It is pretended he brought from Turkey, the braU 
tach JlAthe, (confecrated banner) the remains of which are ftill 
preferved, as a monument of ancient credulity, in the caftle 
of Dunvegan, now the feat of the lairds of Macleod. This 
hrattach Jhlthe was fuppofed to be endowed with the virtue 
of confounding the enemy and fecuring victory, when dis- 
played in the molt perilous exigency of war. It is faid to 
have been twice diiplayed with fuccefs, in the feuds of the 
clans. It has only one turn more to ferve, and then it lofes 
all its virtues. This romantic tradition makes it probable, 
that the per/on mor was engaged in one of the croifades, per- 
haps at the taking of Conftantinople. 

Elizabeth Campbell, a poor woman, who died not many 
years ago, was remarkable for a religious turn, and various 
a as of mortification. Sae went about from houfe to houfe 
begging viftuals and wool. The wool fhe fpun on her diftaff,

and got manufactured into coarfe cloths, by the fale of which 
{he gradually hoarded a Tu n of 50 I. Sterling, which, at her 
death, flie bequeathed to the poor of the pariffi, under the 
adminiftration of the kirk-feffion. 

Par.— Here the poor have many advantages, and, though 
numerous, are upon the whole well provided for. In the 
fealbn of plenty they are liberally fupplied by the people, who 
are very charitable, and indeed too fiequently allow them- 
felves to be impoied upon by vagrant llurdy beggars from 
other countries. To prevent thefe impofitions, badges were 
lately dillributed among thofe ot the pari h poor, who are al- 
lowed to go about begging alms, but they regard them as an 
ignominious diftindlion, and the people too generally confider 
the u as an ufelefs innovation. The number now on the roll 
is 75. They are arranged into four cldfle^ ; and in the diuri- 
bution of the funds under the management of the kirk-feffion, 
are ferved according to their relpective neceffities, into which 
a previous fcrutiny has been made. It is only in the fu.nmer 
feafon, when provifions are fcarce, that they are fuppiied out 
of the ordinary funds. Then there is a More of meal laid in 
for them, and each pauper gets fo many pecks in proportion 
to the whole ftore, according to the clafs on which he has 
been entered. Tnis, with the help of what fiffi and fhell fiffi 
he can gather, befides fome fheep milk, (for few even of the 
poor want Iheep on the commons) relieves his neceffities till 
the new crops come in. In fummer 1791, 30 bolls of meal, 
bought at 18 s.per boll, were diftributed among them. The 
funds are the annual rent of 50 1. already mentioned, as left 
by Elizabeth Campbell, and of 50 1. more laid up from the 
favings of good years ; the fines arifing from delinquencies ; 
the Sabbath collections at church j and the oblations at the

The prefent incumbent, foon after his admiffion, made out

Since this period the population has been fafi increafiog-, and 
the following circumftances regarding its prefent flate, care- 
fully invertigated, A. D. 1792, for the purpofes of this fla« 
tiftical furvey, may be depended upon as authentic.

The great increafe of population, fince 1779, is owing to 
a variety of caufes. There has been no emigration, neither 
has there been any drain of young men for the ufe of the ar- 
my or navy fince that period They have generally married 
very early in life. The alvanced price of kelp gave fome 
fpur to induftry in that line of manufacture. The late wor-

thy proprietor, having for the few laft years of his life, r$- 
lided in the country, carrying on improvements, and intend- 
ing to direct the induftry of the people in a new line, kept a 
little Mir of bufinels agoing for a fhort time, which induced 
a few Grangers to fettle in the parifh ; but the fufpenflon of 
thefe operations, in confequence of his lamented death in 
1 790, has again affected the population fo far, that much 
cannot now be attributed to this circumftance. The chief 
caufe is, that the principal tackfmen have almoft doubled the 
number of their fubtenants in the creeks on the eaftern fhore, 
where the poor people are defirous to fettle for the conveni- 
ence and advantage of fifhing fythe and cuddy. Having no 
accefs to fait under the prelent ftate of the ialt laws, thefe 
are almoft the only kinds of fifti among the numerous fpecies 
on the coaft, which they are encouraged to look after ; and 
of thefe, fortunately for them under fuch a levere operation 
of law, they can procure, with little labour, a frefti fupply 
to their families, generally every morning and evening. 

The number of birrhs and marriages in 1 792, is confiderably 
below the average of former year-. ; but the number of deaths 
is extraordinary. There was a bad kind of the fmall-pox, 
which carried off" a number ol the children, almoft all ino- 
culated by their parents, without medical affiftance, a plan 
which was found to have anlwered, at former periods, with- 
out any fatal confequence : Belides this, the people were vi- 
iited by a peftilential fever, with which every foul in a fami- 
ly once infected was laid up; and it generally proved fatal 
to old pei-ple. 

1 he climate as well as the occupation of the inhabitants 
feems favourable to health. In the lummer months, when 
the weather is fair, the air is moft falubrious ; but it is liable 
to ludden changes, which may account for the difeafes moft 
prevalent here, viz. coughs and rheumatifms. This country 

Vol. X. 3 C was

was once remarkable for inftances of longevity. Martin, in 
his account of the Wcftern Ifles, fays, he knew feverals in 
Harris of 90 years of age, as was attefted by the minilter and 
elders. The lady Macleod, he adds, who paft the moft of 
her time here, lived to 103, had then a comely head of hair 
and good teeth, and enjoyed a perfect understanding till the 
week lhe died. Her fon Sir Norman Macleod died at 96 ; 
and his grandfon Donald Macleod, Efq; late of Berneray, 
died at 91. Four perfons, calling themfelves upwards of 90, 
died during the incumbency of the prefent minifter. An old 
gentlewoman born and brought up in this parifh, faid by her 
relations to be 102, now lives in the Ifle of Sky. As no re- 
gifiers of births and deaths have been kept, it is impoffible 
to be precife in regard either to ages or numbers j but, as far 
as recollection ferves, one circumftance, evincing the health- 
fulnefs of the climate, is very remarkable, viz. that from the 
year 1779 to 1785, the average number of deaths, of adult 
perfons, can fcarcely be rated at three each year. 

Language. — Gaelic is univerfally fpoken here ; and excepting 
the number already fpecified, who have been taught to read 
and write Engli'h, few can fpeak any other language. It is 
almoft obvious to common reflexion, that the inhabitants of 
thefe- iflaadsv formerly cut off, both by their local and poli- 
tical fituation, from alL connection with the Scottifh, Pictifh, 
and Saxon nations, and having as yet but little intercourfe 
with firangers, mult have retained this dialect of the ancient 
Celtic in its greateft purity. It has not been adulterated in 
the leaft degree by the Danifh conquerors ; excepting the 
nair.es of places, we fcarcely find a word reiembling any of 
the Norve ian dialects in the Gaelic of the Hebrides. All of 
thofe barbarous invaders who fettled in the country, foon 
adopted, the language and manners of the conquered - y one

proof, by the way, among others, that both were at that 
time more civilized and poliflied than their own. 

Charatler of the People. — The rude ftate of the poor peo- 
ple, in regard to civil and religious improvement, already 
rejrefented with fidelity, icarcely requires a comment. It 
too clearly indicates neglect on the part of thofe whofe in- 
tereft and whofe duty it was to have enlightened them. 
Their vices are fuch as muff be fuppoled, among a people 
proftffir\g ChriJtianity, to proceed from difficulty of accefs 
to gofpel ordinances, and from a total want of police. We 
- would therefore fpread a veil over them. They are more 
than counterbalanced by their virtues, almort the pure fruits 
of nature. They are lbber, docile, fagacious, and capable 
of induftry, were a channel opened to them in which indus- 
try might be profitably exerted. They are kind and cour- 
teous to ftrangers, hofpitable and charitable even to excefs. 
They have the ftrongeft attachment to their native country, 
and entertain the moft ardent gratitude to benefactors. 

An object of the moft noble and laudable ambition is pre-

Advantages and Difadvantages —The natural advantages of 
this country are iuccincl]y enumerated by the author of the 
book above quoted, p. 9. of the Stae of Scotland, where 
fpealcing of the inftances ot longevity mentioned by Martin, 
which he afcribes to the healthfulnefs of the climate and the 
temperate way of living, he adds, that, 1 this is very good 

* encouragement for others to adventure flocks and factories 

f for 

' ed well for a time. The fifh they caught were accounted the 

* belt of their kind in Europe, and yielded ;i price accordingly ; 
f but the king withdrawing his money afterwards, to fupply 
« his preiling occafions, the merchants were difpieafed at it, and, 
' differing among themfelves, did alfo withdraw theirs, which 
' ruined the defign.' 

Since that period no particular attention has been paid by ad- 
minidration to a country, in which this tingle experiment might 
have taught them to look for neglected foui-.es of public wealth ; 
and the only object ot the landlords was to raife their rents with- 
out attempting any improvement whatever; till the year 1783, 
when the late Captain Macleod, of patriotic memory, having be- 
come proprietor of Harris, took up nii relidence in the country, 
and commenced a fcheme of improvements, which, if he had 
Jived to accomplifh, was likely to advance the general profperi- 
ty of the inhabitants. His object was to call the attention of 
the people clvefly to the Sfhing. He deepened, at a consider- 
able expence, the entrance to an excellent little bafon at Row- 
dill, tit to accommodate all the boats belonging to the country, 
as well as feveral veiTcis of oidinaiy burden. Within this he 
built iwo qu.iys and a breall-work. He employed the people, 
and paid them weil for their labour. He caufed the tenants to 
begin to make cart roads for opening a communication through 
the country In order to give the proper direction to female 
"indnfl-y, he built a houfe for a manufactory, endows it with a 
falary ior a millrcfs, and got to it a number of fpinning wheeli. 
He entered into terms with the Britiih Society for erecting a 
fHhing Ration at Tarbert, where ground to a confiderabie ex- 
tent was accordingly meafured out for this purpofe. In a word, 
he was zealous in promoting the public good, but his time was 
too fnort to ccniummate any one of the beneficent projects he 
had laid. All the labours which he commenced, have ceafed, 
anil ad the monuments of his patriotifrn, which he left half fi- 
uilhcc 1 , arc now verging to decay.

t for improvement of trade here, efpecially confidering the 
i Simplicity of the people's manners, and their innate refpect, 
« and kindnefs to Grangers. In a word,' continues our au- 
thor, ' the number, fafety, and commodioufnefs, of the bays 
« and harbours in thefe iflands, and the multitude of fifh in 
« all of them, look as if nature had defigned them for pro- 
f motmg a fifhing trade; and were the people better inftruc- 

4 ted in fifliing, &amp;c. thefe iflands are capable of maintaining 

5 ten tim-es the prefent number of inhabitants/ All that 
this author very juftly obferves, of the Hebrides in general, 
is peculiarly applicable to Harris. Its natural difadvantages 
aril'e from the barrennels of the foil, and other circumstances 
already lpecified in the local fituation of the inhabitants In 
their political circumltances, their are various abuies which 
muit be rectified, before a fpirk of uleful induftry can be ex- 
cited, and general happinels promoted among them. The 
falutary operation of the Bntith laws is lutie telt here ; and 
the precious liberty of Britifh fubjec"ts is little known, except* 
to a few individuals. The ppveny, the ignorance, the per- 
verfe habits of the lower clais of people, ana even the lucal 
prejudices of thofe better informed, will prove an obftacle of 
ferious moment to the introduction of a fyftem of improve- 
ment, which, profecuted with energy and effect, might, in 
procefs of time, advance this poor deipifed country to a high 
Irate of profperity and political confequence. 

Means by ivhicb the fituation of the people might be meliorated. 
— The inhabitants of Harris can never rife to a comrorrable 
degree of profperity, till they learn to avail themfelves or the 
natural advantages of their local fituation. It is evident from 
the foregoing account, that in cultivating the barren land, 
they ftrive againft nature to force a miferable pittance from 
the earth, while in another element fhe prefents her trea-

lures to enrich them. Were a judicious feleaion made, of 
proper ftations on the fea-coafr, for profecuting the fifheries, 
and manufactures eftablifhed for conftanr employ to the fifh- 
crmen's families, and in the intervals of the fifhing to them- 
felves, a foundation would be laid for a progreffive fyftem 
of induftry, which, under the vigorous direction of an en- 
lightened proprietor, and cheriflied by the foftering hand of 
a beneficent government, might, in a few generations, prove 
no inconfiderable accefiion to the commercial intereft of the 
Britilh limpire But thefe are ideas of a confummation de- 
voutly to be wilhed, which, in prefent circumftances, fomc 
may think chimerical even to mention, and which we are, 
by no means, (anguine in our expectations of feeing fpeedi- 
ly brought into a promifing train of commencement. In the 
mean time a proprietor, of a liberal mind, more ambitious 
to provide for the future aggrandizement of his family for- 
tune, than folhcitous to fqueeze from his tenants a tempor- 
ary fupply to his Goffers, ought never to lofe fight of this ob- 
ject, and fhould endeavour gradually to prepare the people 
for its accomplifhn.ent in due feafon. Before the renewal 
of leafes, a well digefted fcheme of the molt rational and 
practicable improvements fhould be laid down, with the ap- 
probation of fenfible people acquainted with the country and 
zealous for its good. The lands fhould be given to fubftan- 
tial tenants, fpecifically bound, by the tenor of their tacks, 
to co-operate with the proprietor, on terms of mutual equi- 
ty, in bringing this falutary fcheme into execution. Little, 
its true, can be done to improve the lands in general, yet 
fomething may. Sufficient encouragement fhould be given 
to each tackfman, to inclofe and cultivate, to the bed ad- 
vantage, the few arable fpots, or fuch as may, by fkillful and 
economical management, be rendered arable, for railing, 
chiefly, if not wholly, hay and other green crops for pro-

moft boundaries, by proper fences, mould be laid out for 
pafture, on which either a good ftock of black cattle or of 
ftieep, might be reared. There lhould be either no com- 
mon, or as little as the nature of circumftances can poffibly 
admit. 

The lowed clafs of people now, in effect, a burden 011 
the hands of the landholders, an annoyance to one another, 
in many inftances rather a nuifance than ufeful members of 
fociety, in a ftate of wretched dependence, of inactivity and 
of want, mould be gradually weaned from the clumfy fyftem 
in ufe ; and taught, inftead of labouring for a pitiful fub- 
fiftence from the fcanty and precarious fruits of a fterile foil, 
to look for a more lecure and comfortable maintenance in 
the profits arifing from their manual induftry employed in a 
different line. They might be collected into villages, erect- 
ed for them, on thofe parts of the coaft that lie mod con- 
tiguous to the fifhing grounds. They fhould be fupplied, at 
a moderate price, in meal, and constantly furnilhed with the 
proper materials to work on, both when aihore and when 
at fea. They fhould be free to profecute the fiihing for 
their own immediate benefit, and made to feel the advantage 
of working for themlelves. J hey lhould have little or no 
land to withdraw their attention from thefe new purluits. 
Thus fituated, at fiVlt their wants and afterwards their am- 
bition will prompt them to follow the line of induftry now 
pointed out ; and if the habits of the people are once form- 
ed to it, men of fufHcient capitals may embark in this defiga 
at their head with a fair prof peel of fuccefs. 

The proprietor {hould, at all times, give ample encourage- 
ment to every public inftitution calculated to extend the 
means of religious instruction, to educate the riling genera- 
tion in a knowledge of the elements of literature and rudi-

prejudices of the people at large, to introduce the arts of ci- 
vilized life, and to promote the happinefs of the community. 

It is to be hoped, that the legiflator will no longer hold 
a deaf ear to the univerfal cry of the poor people on the wef- 
tern cosfts ; and that in confequence of a wife modification 
of the fait laws, they may all foon have accefs to a fufHcient

(Prejbytery of Mull—Synod and County of Argyle.) 

By the Reverend Mr Archibald M'Coll.</head> 


<p>Name. 

TIRY or Tir-I feems to import the country belonging 
to I. or Iona, this ifland lying within 10 leagues of 
Icolumkil. It appears to have been, in the time of St Co- 
lumba, part of the patrimony of the church, and to have 
fupplied that famous feat of learning with confiderable quan- 
tities of grain. It had a more ancient name, Rioghacbd barfo 
ihuin, i. e. * The kingdom whofe fummits are lower than 
« the waves,' and this name, ftill ufed in romantic tales, 
indicates the natural fituation of the ifland, the Ioweft and 
flatted country perhaps in Scotland. The waves are often 
feen, from the one fhore, riling feveral feet above the level 
of the rocks upon the other. Coll or Colla is another ifland, 
making part of the parifh of Tiry, feparated E. by N. from. 
Tiry, by a found about a league broad. In this found lies 
the ifland of Gunna, a mile long and half a mile broad. 
There are befides feveral uninhabited iflets, fuch as the two 
Soas, Ellen-mor, &amp;c.

Extent. 



394 Stati/lkal Account 

Extent. — On the W. the profpect from this pariih i» 
bounded only by ihe Atlantic Ocean. The Iflcs of B. rra, 
Uift, Sky, Rum, Egg, Canna, and Monk, with the hills of 
IMorven, Moidart, Morthir, Arafaig, and Cnoidart, are feen 
at a diftance, with Ardmurchan and Mull more in the 
neighbourhood,, and at near triple the diftance, lfh, Jura, 
Collonfa, and Scarba, with the mainland of Ar^yle, may be 
.diirerned. The pardh extends, nearly in a ftraight line, 
from VV. by S. to £. by N. about 29 Englilh miles, includ- 
ing the found. Of this extent, Tiry is about 1 1 miles long, 
and near 2 \ broad, and Coll about 14 long aod 2 broad.. 
The whole contains nearly 25000 acres. 

Surface t CSV. — The coaft is moftly rocky, interfered with 
many beautiful landy bays, fome of them a mile broad at the 
head. The Bay of Gott is about 2-|- miles round the head ; 
and the ground fo firm, that a horle at full gdlop makes an 
impreffion not above half an inch deep. About the half of 
Tiry is arable, interfperfed with fmall rocks and riling 
grounds* There are tive or fix green hills ; three of them 
from 200 to 300 feet above the level of the fea. There are 
24 lakes, covering about 600 acres, fome of which might be 
eafily drained ; trouts cannot live in them, owing to the in- 
credible number of eels. There are no marfhes and fcarce- 
ly any dangerous bogs ; for though a great part of this flat 
furface, in a rainy feafon, be wet, the bottom is cither rock 
or firm land. In the interior parts, about 1200 acres of 
ground were, till within thefe three years, common to the 
whole inhabitants, but they are now inclofed and included 
in the adjacent farms. This ground is moftly heath, of very 
fmall growth. The foil ieems to have been of confiderable 
depth, though, having been often cut for fuel, the rocks are 
now expoled. At every bay lies invariably a tract of fandy 

ground s 



of Tiry. 395 

ground, either arable, green mounts, or broken banks, 
perhaps 40 or 50 feet high. This fand, in courfe of time, 
driven by the winds, and not prevented by a coat of fea- 
weeds, or heavy earth, afcends into the interior parts, and 
lays wafte large tracks of ground. 

T..out)h Coll conlitls alio of low ground, ic differs much 
from Tiry. The coaft is bolder. Nor ahove a 1 6th part of 
it is arable. The inhabitants by induftry make good crops 
by delving. Though rugged and unfriendly to the plough, it 
affords excellent fhelter for cattle. A very confiderable part 
is heath, and mofly ground, partly convertible into arable. 
It contains 48 final] Lkes, 19 of them abounding in trouts. 

The whole of Tiry and the two ends of Coll are the pro- 
perty of the Duke of Argyle, who is alfo patron. The middle 
part ot Coll l above two thirds of the ifland) is the property of 
rhe Laird of Coll, who chiefly refides in the parilh. Tra- 
dition fays, that the whole property defcended, from Mac- 
tlonald of the Jfles, to the Macleans Ey marriage the Mac- 
leans retained it till the family of Argyle obtained right to 
the greateft part of Mull, Morven, and Tiry. The real rent 
Gf the parifh is near 2000 1. 

Soil, Proditce y Cultivation. — The foil of Tiry is various ; 
fandy, raofly, clay, and black earth, with their different com- 
petitions. The fandy foil prevails, and produces very poor 
crops, except when very well manured. If fovvn early, there- 
is danger of blowing; if late, of fummer drought. The 
country being flat, even a fhort continuance of rain endangers 
the vegetation m the lower grounds. Two-thirds of the 
whole arable ground are either too wet or too dry; and ai- 
n.oit the wu .,ie lurrace is expofed to ftorms. The returns, 
communibus minis, are about 4 feed:, from barley, and 2^ from 
Imall brack oats (the prevailing forts of grain) and about .5 

from 



39 6 Statijlical Account 

from potatoes, of which a great quantity is planted, moftly 
in lazy beds. Drilling potatoes is now introduced. The 
increafe is from 8 to 20 feeds, and the incumbent has feen 
it at 32. They tell of far fuperior increafe in grain, when 
the land was in good condition. There were then Icarcely 
tenants fufficient to occupy the lands, though now they are 
fo numerous, that the ground is fet in too finall portions to 
accommodate perhaps 1 2 or 24 of them in one farm, each 
paying from 1 1. to 4 1. 4 s. of yearly rent. The eonfequence 
is, they plough as much as they can ; and their lands are 
impoverilhed, as they feldom get reft. Above two- thirds of 
the manure are fea-weed. The great quantity of fait they 
contain is, indeed, poifon to many weeds ; but as they foon 
putnfy and duTolve, and, as a ftimulus, produce their effect, 
they cannot laft long, nor add much to the foil, having but 
little earth. Till the middle of June, the cattle are fuffered 
to pafture on the corn, which alfo very much prevents a bet- 
ter return. Such practices, with the unfavourable climate, 
make the crop precarious. The foil of Coll, though broken 
with rocks, is preferable, and the returns are in proportion. 
Repeated trials have been made of fowing great white oats. 
The ground was either poor, too dry or too wet. They did 
not ripen as early as the native oats, and could not withfland 
the ftorms. Often they did not return even their feed, 
though they might anfwer well in fome fpots, if inclofed, 
drained, and fown early. The parifh is under a great dif- 
advantage in not getting a more frequent change of different 
feeds ; and that is never enjoyed unlefs by a few gentlemen, 
at a very high expence, with many difappointments. In- 
troducing peafe, turnips, and other roots, and green crops in 
general, would be a great improvement, efpecially in this 
foil and climate. The native flax is fcarcely 18 inches long ; 
and there are no ways of drelling it expeditioufly, whereby 



of Tiry. 397 

it becomes a dear manufacture. A few experiments of Tow- 
ing grafs turned out well. The natural grafs of mo ft of the 
fields is red and white clover and daify. Frequent but ihort 
rains, mixing different foils as manures, ufing comport dung- 
hills, with a great number of drains and incioiuves, may pto- 
nuTc a joytul harveft. 

Seed Time, HarveJ}, &amp;c. — The ordinary time of fowing oats 
and planting potatoes is from 26th March to the loth May ; 
and for barley from the 30th April to the 20th June. The 
harveft generally begins about the middle of Auguft, and is 
finimed about the 10th Oclober. The farmers cannot well 
begin fowing earlier, owing to wet lands, fand blowing, and 
trefpafs of cattle; but they might to great advantage iinifh. 
earlier. What moftly prevents it is, that barley is the pre- 
vailing crop, which gets two and fometimes three ploughings, 
and fo confumes much time. 

Now, as they are bufy inclofing, and can therefore pre- 
ferve their grounds, it is to be hoped they will attend to this 
particular, whence the following great advantages might 
arife : They might earlier fow their corn and hay, provide 
fuel, manufacture their kelp, fifh more, and, what is now 
hardly thought of, manure and otherwife improve part of 
their farms in fummer, and then finifh their harveft earlier 
and fafer ; and fo the whole annual rotation of work would 
be more feafonable. 

The inhabitants commonly ferve themfelves in meal, feed, 
and fpirits. Hardly any foreign fpirits are now imported. 
The laft feafon proved rather better. A few years ago they 
ufually fold from 200 to 300 Scotch gallons of whifky to 
the neighbouring iflands. The parifh had then upwards of 
30 ftills, but is now reduced to three fmall licenfed ones. 
Now the inhabitants are increafed and, in the bad feafons 

of 



39* 



Statijlkal Account 



of 1 790 and 1 79 1, they hardly diftilled 300 bolls; and bought, 
each fuccreding year, above 2000 bolls of meal at a very high 
rate, and their feed potatoes at 5 s. per barrel *. 

Woods. — It plainly appears that wood formerly grew in 
this parifh. when thinly inhabited and fewer cattle reared. 
Frequently large pieces of trees are found in tnofles ; though 
now then is not a tree in it, nor is it probable that upon 
trial any would thrive in it, the utuation beintr lb far in the 
ocean and without Ihelter. There are, indeed, fome fmall 
twigs 2 or 3 feet lon^ growing in Coll, which is better fhel- 
tered than Tiry. Efpalk-rs rile the height of a wall, and ber- 
ry bufhes thrive when fheltered in gardens, The laird of 
Coll plan'ed a large garden. The berry bullies thrive in 
it, but the young trees, though prouiiring at firft, loon dif- 
cover that this is not their climate. 

The Duke of Argyle fupplies his ten mts gratis with tim- 
ber out of his woods on the fide or Lochfunart, 60 or 70 
miles off; yet it often becomes a dangerous and dear pure \ ile, 
requirmg the hire of boats and hands for a fortnight or up- 
wards. The dampnefs of the air, and blowing of land, upon 
many of the houfes, loon rot the roofs, and make the de- 
mand frequent and expenfive. 

Waters, 

* The boll of barley fells from 16 s. to 1 1. and fmall oats at 
half thefe prices. Potatoes fn m 1 s. to 2 s. 6d. per barrel. The 
gentlemen rear lb well, and the fmall tenants have fo few 
cattle, that very little butter or cheefe is made; 24 lib Englifh 
of ear h fell at 18s.; beef fi om 1 1. ro s. to 2 k per barrel ; frtfh 
fizeable cod at 3d.; ling 6d. ; fwine from j s. to 10s.; 
fheep from 4s to 6s; hens and ducks 6d. ; and live cows 
from 1 1. 6s. to 3I 10s. Having no fixed markets of any 
kind in the parifh, nor way to lend to them, we labour under 
this great difadvantage, that, when we abound, we get no ar- 
ticles fold, and when we mult buy, it is commonly at the high- 
eft rate : When provilions are t. 0 cheap, it is not fo much ow- 
ing to the great abundance as to the want of a market.

Waters, Mills, Though there be a great number of 

&amp;ooks, Tiry mills feldom can be wrought tor warn of water 
or fufficient falls, above five or fix months yearly. This 
makes it necefiary, either to lend our grain at a great expence 
to other countries, or ufe querns or hand-mills By the low- 
eft calculation, the work of 50 women is yearL loll at grind- 
ing. This, with 'he great lois of s rain, which we experience, 
the lols of other lao-ur, time, and expences, amounts yearly 
to feveral hundred pounds Sterling. But there is now ex- 
pectation ot a wind-mill *. 

Minerals,. 



* It is remarkable that at the heads of creeks and bays;, 
there are freque ntly banks formed of fmall round (tones, covered 
with earth, feemingjy formed by the violence of the fea, though 
now fat above high water mark. 

There is a plain, cailed the Reef, near the center of Tiry,. 
ieckoned by tnvellers a very great curiollty It is almolt a 
pentagon of 1200 Sc tch acie-., wth a fandy bottom moftly co- 
vered with black earth ten inches deep, a beautiful carpet va- 
riegated with flowers. It leems to have been gained from the 
fea ; the work of ages. The part next the fhore has received, 
eonfiderable addition 1 - withm the prefent generation. It has 
three curved green banks, each about two feet high, upon 
which it appears the fea had formerly beat. Between thefe 
bank-, the ground is furpnllngly plain The greateft height 
above high water mark is about fix feet, except a fmall green 
hill near the centei, nine feet higher. The whole Reef is » 
common untouched by a plough. Upon the top of this hill, 
looking backwards from under the arm. all the objects upon the 
plain are feen inverted. This plain is bounded on one hde bv 
Faothail, or a fmall channel with a meandring current, lbfmooth 
that the motion isfcarcely perceptible, It branches towards the 
head, which is withm one third of a mile to the other fhore. 
When fwelled with rain and a high fpring tide, being without 
a bridge, it greatly obftrudts travellers. Here the.re is fome 
danger of the :flana hang cut in two, ti prevent which a bar- 
ricade of (lone and earth was railed on the o,-pofite fhore, in 
one part; and the violent itorm-. have railed a high bank of 
round (tones in another; yet the impetuous f.rge lbmetiraes 
baffles the whole. There is the like danger near the welt end 
of Loll among the fund banks.

Minerals. — Hard whinftone prevails in this parifh, yet 
there is frequently ironftone and granite, and in one farm 
abundance of limeftone and marble. The qualities of the Ti- 
ry marble are now well known ; it is fometimes pure white ; 
fometimes red and white, or white and green ; and fome- 
times variegated with numberlefs figures. It is to be hoped 
a correfpondence will be continued, a market procured, and 
a marble work carried on. — There is alfo a lead mine at 
Croflapol in Coll. 

Animals. — The hill of Ceanmharra, the weft point of Tiry, 
is very remarkable for a great number of large natural caves, 
frequented, in time of hatching, by innumerable flocks of fea- 
fowls. The height of fome of the caves 160 feet, the fea 
bellowing in below, and thoufands of fowls, with difcordant 
notes, crouding upon the cliffs, form a hideous fcene. In 
other magnificent caves, the raven, the hawk, or the eagle, 
build their lofty nefts. Separate from all thefe, the pigeons 
have chofen their habitations : Hither their enemy, at the rifk 
of his life, defcends a very unpleafant flair, carrying fire and 
a bundle of ftraw, to which he fets fire. The fmoke fuffbcat- 
ing them, they fly into the flames, attached to the light, ap- 
parently the paflage to efcape •, thus numbers of them are 
caught. At the diftance of 6 leagues weftward from this 
hill, lie a clufter of unhofpitable rocks, called Sceir-mhor, to 
which young adventurers, before fun riling in a calm fummer 
day, go in queft of fport. The fkins of the fea-calves, the 
old inhabitants of thefe rocks and feas, which they kill with 
clubs or bullets, commonly meafure from fix to eight feet 
in length. 

Three forts of wild geefe frequent thefe ifles. About the 
beginning of April, they all go off to places of greater fecuri- 
ty and fhelter for hatching, and return as foon as their young 

are 



of Tiry. . 401 

are able to accompany them. When feeding in the mea- 
dows, or fields, they are fure to keep at a diftance from rocks 
and dykes, and have conftantly a centinel. When flying 
they form an angle about 45 degrees inclined. The goofe 
in the angle leads the reft, till he changes his place, and a 
neighbour fucceeds him. Swans alfo, in fmaller companies 
with their melodious march, come as paffengers upon the 
lakes. Many thoufands of gray plovers are feen together, 
efpecially upon the reef or great plain ; they obferve the 
fame feafon with the wild-geefe in hatching ellewhere. The 
green plovers hatch in the Hland. Rails are very numerous. 
Moufe coloured fwallows inhabit the fand banks. The cuc- 
koo is very rarely feen. Magpies, and many other birds 
which are upon the mainland, never appear. There are 
neither ferpents, toads, frogs, weafels, nor venomous crea- 
tures of any kind. Rabbits are numerous, lodging in the 
fand in the eaft end of Coll s and a couple of hares introduc- 
ed there, about 7 years ago, are increaled to many hund- 
reds *. 

Climate, 

* Antiquities, — There are many figns of Danifli invaders 
having for fome time polTefTed thefe lfles. Among thefe are

light of fome other. They are faid to have been ufed, when 
an enemy appeared, for fuddenly alarming the country by the

parifh, feemingly erected as monuments. Britifli. Danifh, and 
other fmall filver coins, in fmall earthen vefiels, have often been 
dug out of molTes and fandy ground. Two years ago, was dis- 
covered a bent tubular piece of gold about 2 1, value, the two 
ends not clofely joined, and not unlike a fort of ear-ring. In a 
Hack-yard at Cornaigbeg in Tiry, in digging pits in fandy 
ground to fecure potatoes during winter and fpring, there were 
lound at different time3 human fkeletons, and nigh them the 
fkeletons of horfes. They feemed to have been compleatly armed, 
according to ths times. Two handed fwords were found dimi- 
cifhed v ith ruft ; filver work preferved the handles ; there were 
alio fhields and helmets, with a brafs fpear Nigh this was dif- 
covered another fkeleton, holding the lkeleton of an infant in 
its arms. It is propofed to dig more of this ground. Some of 
thefe curiohlies are in the pofTeffion of the Duke of Argyle.

iflands; when fnow in the one, there is often but rain in the 
other. The rain water lodges on this flat furface ; and with 
the exhalations from fo many lakes, in calm weather, often 
riles in mitt. An inland country, in this damp fituation, 
would be very unhealthy ; but the healthy fea air generally 
drives away whatever is noxious. The houies of the com- 
mon people are generally in dry fituations and remarkably 
warm, built as ul'ual in fandy iflands (partly through wane 
of ftones, which are ill to quarry, but moftly out of choice,) 
of an inner and outer Angle wall, filled up in the middle with, 
fandy earth from 4 to 6 feet thick. The people are lively, 
induftrious, and chearful, and often engaged in aclive em- 
ployments, in the open air; yet the dampnefs of the place, 
the want of proper firing, and the poor living of many, feem 
to be the great caules of frequent rheumatifms, dyfentaries, 
and nervous fevers. Draining of the lakes, and flat grounds, 
may add much to the falubrity of the place. Both ifles, up- 
on the whole, appear to be healthy from the great age to 
which many of the inhabitants attain.

The Tiry-man above 100, was allowed to be 106, at his 
death, in fpring laft. Except for the laft 7 years he fupport- 
ed himfelf and wife by herding. His livelinefs appeared to 
the laft, not only by walking but dancing. There are no re- 
gifters of births or burials, and the parifh records preceeding 
the prefent incumbent's time have been loft. 

There are not 40 natives of any other parifh in the two 
ifles. Tradefmen are numerous, yet fome good ones are 
much wanted. It is not eafy to calculate their number, be- 
caufe, in general, they are not diftindt from farmers. Many 
men and women work at the weaving bufinefs. There are 
very few batchelors or widowers. The men frequently mar- 
ry at 19 or 20. The population has been alfo increafed, 
within thefe 14 years, by three fuccefsful courfes of inocula- 
tion. 

The fituation of the parifh is difmal without a furgeon re- 
ading in it. Poor people cannot afford fending occafionally 
for a furgeon, to a diftant country, at great expence-, with 
frequent disappointments •, the raging elements forbid it j or 
perhaps before the relief arrive, the hope of the family is no 
more. Too often has the prefent incumbent feen child- b- d 
women, in particular, fall fad Sacrifices without relief. It is 
too much for this parifh, without manufactures, and without

greater improvements in agriculture, to fupport 3457 inhabi- 
tants, if they mould be free of other burdens. Yet the peo- 
ple have often and cordially united to make up a fmall falary, 
according to their abilities, and beftowed it upon young fur- 
geons, who refided now and then amongft them, confider- 
ing it as a temporary appointment. There are now fo many 
pious mortifications, fo many public funds raifed upon chari- 
table foundations ; if, in this refpec*l, the fituation of this pa- 
rifh was reprefented and known, Is there any part in Scot- 
land in greater need of relief from them ? A fund of this 
kind, with a farm to refide on, together with what a furgeon 
could add to it by his practice, might be an objedt worth at- 
tention to fome gentleman of that profeflion. In the time of 
the laft American war, in one twelvemonth 120 youths, and 
in this fpring above 100, left this ifland for the fervice of 
their country. Does not this merit attention in many ref- 
pefts ? 

Fuel. — Coll Ifland abounds in mofs of the beft quality for 
peats, but at fuch diftances from fome of the farms, that 
coals bought at moderate prices, would be far cheaper. One 
end of Tiry can, for a few years, make peats, but in the other 
end near 200 families are reduced to the greateft diftrefs. 
They are robbed of the mofi valuable feafon, in which they 
fhould be improving their farms, in ruining, in fleaing them, 
2 or 3 inches deep, wherever there is the fmalleft mixture of 
mofs in the foil. They have now expofed the rocks in many 
places. Neceffity finds out many fhifts. Sometimes in fpring 
they gather dried horfe dung; they even burn ftraw, and 
then comes the laft fhift, burning the roofs of their houles 
or fo;ne of their furniture.

cupied by fmall tenants, 1200 or 1500 males and females, 
above eight year old. might be fpared for fifhing and other 
manufactures. For which purpofe, wherever the fituatiou 
admits of it, every farm, efpecially thofe from 30 to 200 in- 
habitants, fhould be fubdivided and inclofed to one, or at 
mod four tenants each divifinn. Thefe few would be more 
difpofed to improve their farms than now, in common with 
many, whofe main ftudy is to plough all they can, though 
but ill prepared for a good crop. Numerous inhabitants are 
agreeable, and have their ufes. Here they may be made ftill 
more numerous ; but when with a view to ferve them all, 
lands in common are divided into very fmall portions, fuch 
families can never thrive. If the fuperfluous number of ten- 
ants were converted into manufacturers, the remaining ones 
would be more eafily enabled to pay their rents, even if aug- 
mented, live better, educate their children, nnd fell more to 
fupport the manufacturers, who in return would enrich the 
country from a variety of fources. As this parifh, when im- 
proved, might fupport a village in raoft of the neceflaries of 
life, befides the above divifions, for the encouragement of 
tradefmen, a convenient fituation fhould be chofen for inclo- 
fures of a few acres, for greens, roots, grafs feeds, &amp;c. which, 
though fome of them could not afford to keep a horfe, they 
mi ht improve like a garden with the fpade, or by occafion- 
ally hiring a horfe or plough. Lands, in common with 
others, would ruin a tradefmen, whereas fuch feparate pof- 
feffions would caufe a great emulation for improvements, and 
would be equally to the advantage of proprietors and tenants. 

The ingredients with which any country abounds, point 
out the manufactures proper to begin with. Accordingly, as 
part of this foil could produce good flax, the culture of, and 
preparation of it fhould be ftudied, as none of thefe are well 
underftood here. The abundance of a fuperior quality of 

clay, 



of Tiry. 407 

c Uy, points out another fource of manufactures. Applying 
kelp might be applied to feveral ufes, fait fo convenient to 
the weftern fifheries, might be made here. Several other 
manufactures, of which the materials are eafily i nported, 
flight be tried, l'uch as working of nets, ftockings, &amp;c. The 
atarble alio might employ many hands. Above all, fifhing 
h&amp;uld never be neglected in Tiry and Coll, one of the beft 
Nations in all the weftern iiles. The attempts that have been 
made, and the feveral filhing banks daily difcovered confirm 
his. The country being flat, the feas near it will not na- 
urally be deep. Some of the banks are dole to the fhore. 
Experienced fiihers obferve that, of all the piaces they know, 
his is neareft to the fifhing grounds. In lummer 1787, there 
ivere feveral companies ot natives employed, and, though of lit- 
le experience, they caught at one letting of 200 or 400 hooks, 
totn 30 to 80 cod and ling, belides a variety of fcate, eels, 
lol-fiih, &amp;c. and thole who had harpoons and lines caught at 
:he lame time fail-fifh, each yielding fiom 5 to 8 barrels oil. 
Herrings frequent the bay of Gott, yet there are no netb on 
he ifland. There are yearly companies from Barra, who 
prefer this to their own ifland, efpecially as lefs fatiguing, 
rhefe having more experience, are more fuccefsful than our 
nen. There have been alfo adventurers from Ireland and the 
;aft of Scotland fuccefsful. In one floop particularly, though 
hey concealed their fuccefs, they fecmed, from their heaps 
ipon the fhore, to have caught in 2 months, from 12000 to 
16000 cod and ling. There are, this year, fome companies 
from Barra, one from Ayr, and one only of the natives. They 
:ominonly catch from 100 to 240 per day, fo that fometimes 
they do not raife their whole lines at once; their boats not 
jeing able to carry the fifh afhore. Notwithftandiug fuch a

carry from 3 to 14 tons, of their lying fo conveniently upon 
the fpot, and of having many hardy feamen amongft them, 
they do not, in this diftrift, purfue the fifliing with fpirit. 
The reafons are obvious. They are moftly farmers having a 
fmall portion of land, in common with many, which requires 
daily attendance. Farming in common, and other branches 
of bufinefs, can never thrive in the fame hands. Poor people 
who have a fure, though perhaps a ftarving way of fupport- 
ing their families, feldom rifk their fmall fortunes, and of 
their own accord begin a new branch of bufinefs. The dan- 
ger of not being fuccefsful frightens them. When a conlider- 
able flock is necefiary for fitting them out, the plan is relin- 
quifhed as ideal. Surely the expence in boats, hands, hooks, 
harpoons, lines, &amp;c. is confiderable, and the dorms often 
break their lines and buoys. If a man could fpare, from his 
daily employment, time to catch 200 or 300 cod and ling, 
they turn out to little avail without a purchafer at hand. The 
good effects of the Crinan canal are only yet feen at a dif- 
tance. If the fifher cures with prohibited fait, they are feiz- 
able on the way to market ; he finds it too chargeable for his 
fmall cargo, to vifit the cuftom-houfe fo often, and obferve 
all its regulations for fair, nor indeed does he underftand 
them, he prefers to give triple price for it elfewhere. I have 
feen country lads from neglect of forms like to be ruined, 
and even gentlemen who knew bufinefs fuffer much. If thefc 
regulations muft be kept in force without exception, without 
amendment, a bar to fifhing, fhould not fome wellwifher to 
his country collect and explain them to low capacities ? Thus 
in the fmall attempts, the great things that might arife from 
them are in effect difcouraged. 

Procuring aid to the natives, from fome public fund, to 
purchafe lines, hooks, harpoons, &amp;c. would raife a fpirit of 
emulation to make more attempts, efpecially as an eafy com- 

munication

munication with Clyde will foon be opened. Some perfon 
refiding conftantly in the parilh, with a ftore of fait to pur- 
chafe whatever quantity might be caught, even in winter and 
fpring, when fome of the fifh are beft in feafon, might be of 
efTential lervice. But of all encouragements to make them 
perfevere, the beft is, to improve fome harbours or creeks in 
the moft convenient places ; at leaft one upon the N. fide, 
convenient for the great bank between Tify and Barra, but 
one third nearer Tiry ; and on the S. fide Scairni/h, the 
common harbour, which admits of confiderable improve- 
ments. In its prefent ftate the entrance is very dangerous, 
being too long, and in moft places not above 40 yards wide, 
between two rocks, and a third lying crofs at the very en- 
trance. When in ftormy weather the wind is S. or W. a 
heavy fwell from the Atlantic enters the harbour. When 
the wind is N. N. by E. or N. W. a veflel that might come 
within a few fathoms of the fhore, muft fheer off again to 
fea in a ftorm. When within the harbour, the wind may be 
many days fair for a voyage, but a vefTel cannot get out of it. 
At once to prevent fuch misfortunes and make the ifland 
much more valuable, a fmall expence may build a quay, at 
leaft as far out as it ebbs, to be fecured from the impetuous 
furge, partly with timber and iron, but moftly with loofe 
ftones behind, which are at hand. A fhort quay at each 
fide of the entrance, overlapping each other, with fmall breaft 
works within, may be the moft eligible. Near this, on the 
W. fide of the bay of Gott, is excellent anchoring ground. 
It opens fouthwards, is within 2 miles of the E. end of the 
ifland, and runs near 2 miles into the land. The bottom is 
fand mixed with clay and fea grafs ; and, though fometimes 
there be a fwell, I have feen vefTels ride, in great ftorms, 
without driving one foot. The entrance is very fafe, and the 
depth gradually decreafmg, from 16 fathoms, to the fmalkft 
Vol. X. 3 F f 0r

for a mile inwards. There is a good place for a quay by it. 
It were to be wifhed that this bay was better known, being 
moft convenient for veffels which do not hold through the 
founds, and might prevent many fhipwrecks, one of which 
happened i'o lately as March laft. There are alfo on the S. 
fide of Coll, Loch-Iothuirn and Loch-Breacachy, flations 
where veffels frequently anchor, and which might be much 
improved. A knowledge of thefe harbours is the more ne- 
ceffary, as there are in many places on the coafts a great 
fwell, ftrong currents, and many rocks, as Sceir-mhor weft- 
ward, and the Cairn of Coll eaftward. 

Sheep, Black Cattle, and Horfes. — A few years ago there 
were at leaft 14,000 fheep in thefe ifles. The Laird of 
Coll banifhed them almoft out of his lands. The inclemency 
of the feafons reduced them in Tiry. There are not now 
above 1 1 00 in the parifh. Though in other countries a moft 
beneficial ftock, they are moft deftru&amp;ive, efpecially to Ttry. 
There is not a fufficient range for them. They do not thrive 
in fummer owing to certain weeds; nor in winter on account 
of the wetnefs of the pafture. Where the grals is thin and 
fhort, they tear up by their feet the very roots for food. 
They lodge in hollows for fhelter, and fo break the fward, 
and expofe the fand to be driven by the winds, whence whole 
fields are ruined, becoming white banks. Tiry pafture is al- 
ready too fine. Sheep convert the little coarfe grafs there is 
into a finer pile, to the great prejudice of black cattle, as it 
fubjefts them, when ferried to another country, to the dif- 
temper called murrain or bloody urine, and confequently re- 
duces a third of their price, till they get one winter's fe aton- 
ing elfewhere. Yet if the fheep were banifhed, it would be 
necefTary to contraft for years with fheep-graziers, whereby 
wool might be provided to the inhabitants at a moderate rate.

The black cattle of Tiry and part of Coll, which have no 
accefs to pafture in heathy ground, are fubject as above to 
the murrain, or in Gaelic airneach, probably from its affecting 
the kidneys. It feems to be communicated either from the 
milk or fine grafs, or from both. However, when fheep are 
banifhed, the coarfe grafs inclofed and encouraged to grow, 
being the beft pafture for calves and young cattle, it becomes 
at leaft fuch a feafoning as may prevent the above diftemper. 
Then fuch cattle, deducing the inconveniencies of ferrying, 
might moft probably fell as high as any in the Highlands. 
There are beautiful cattle reared here, efpecially of late, 
which, when fent to Englifti pafture, grow to an amazing 
fize. One of them, of which we lately had an account, fed 
by Mr Spearman of Northumberland, 1 790, weighed in beef, 
tallow, and hide, 117 ftone 5^ lib. 

Except upon gentlemens farms, who occupy two fifths of 
the land, there is not one third more of black cattle than of 
horfes. This cannot be effectually rectified by the prefent 
divifion of the lands and plan of hufbandry.

be reduced to 250 good ones, with fome mares. What 
makes the ploughs fo very numerous, is, that commonly they 
only plough from the beginning of March to the 20th June. 
— At lead one third of the kelp is made of wrack, caft by 
ftorms upon the (hores. 

The black cattle and horfes are moftly in a ftarving con- 
dition. The latter, when their pafture is very bare in win- 
ter and fpring, tear up the ground with their feet to come at 
the roots. Many tenants keep two or three cows, which 
have not a calf for years together. One informed me of his 
having a cow ten years old, that never had but one calf. An- 
other, that he keeps three or four cows, but had not a calf 
for fix years. 

Agriculture, £sV. — Inclofures are lately begun. The above 
facts {hew the necefiity of continuing them, and fubdividing 
farms to a few tenants that may be able to keep carts. After 
a little amendment of the roads, with the money that is raif- 
ed, or the fervices that may be exacted, there is no country 
better calculated for them. As yet there are only five in the 
parifh. . A fmall light Scotch plough is moftly ufed. Great 
is the necefiity of getting timber, and a proper wright. The 
method of ploughing by one man, two horfes, and long reins, 
is ufed only by two in the parifh ; but might very eafily be 
pra&amp;ifed by getting a ftronger breed of horfes. Inftead of 
this, 4 men and 7 horfes often attend the fame furrow ; two 
men and 5 horfes the plough; 2 men and 2 horfes the riftle, or 
fharp iron nearly the fhape of a coulter, but bent further for- 
ward, and like it fixed in a beam, with two handles to cut 
the tough fward before the plough, which follows in the fame 
line. When in one farm 4 or 13 ploughs are fet agoing, 
and 30 or perhaps 96 horfes with creels fent to carry fea-ware 
off the fhore, befides fome idle rnares and followers, fuch a

farm takes many hands and horfes, and labouring muft prove 
dear . A change of method is indeed required ; and fifliing 
with manufaftures to employ fo many fuperfluous hands. 
Though the people be naturally attached to their ancient 
modes, yet whenever they fee new methods purfued to per- 
fettion in inclofed farms, and work carried on much more 
profitably, expeditioufly, and cheaply, they will readily com- 
ply 

CharaBer and CuJIoms of the People — The common people 
are not very attentive to the ordinances of religion, but are 
now reforming, as the gentlemen (hew them a good example. 
They ftill retain fome Roman Catholic fayings, prayers, and 
oaths, as expletives ; fuch as * Bias Muire let,' i. e. God and 
Mary be with you. « Air Muire? fwearing by Mary, &amp;c. 
They are free of fuperftition, and make a confiderable progrefs 
in knowledge. There is no fchifm from the eftablifhed 
church ; and none of any other perfuafion, except now and 
then a few Roman Catholic fervants from Barra. It is a 
great advantage to their morals that there are only three li- 
cenfed fmall ftills, and four public houfes at the ferries and 
harbours in both ifles. For generations back, there has been 



no 



* About 4 years ago, the yearly wages and gratuities of a labour- 
er amounted only to 2I. 12 s. and of a female fervant to 1 1. but 
they are now increafed near a third, owing moftly to the fer- 
vants frequenting the low country. Small tenants give them 
much more. Another caufe of the increafe of wages is the en- 
lifting fo many men for the army, particularly the fencible corps, 
with promifes of poffeffions to their friends or to themfelves at 
their return. Hence partly fo many fmall divifions of lands 
and the poverty of the tenants. Workmen with their families 
are engaged for a fourth or fifth of the whole crop and grafs. 
In fome countries they can more ealily triple thefe wages ; their 
pofleflions, their foil, their markets, and plans of labouring, can 
better afford it. Tradefmen have from 7 d. to 1 s, 2 d. per day, 
befides yidtuals.

no robbery, murder, or filicide. In general they are fubtile, 
and not eafily deceived. They are mannerly, lively, and in- 
genious, very hofpitable to Grangers, and kind to the diftref- 
fed. And though it be impoflible to anfwer for the behavi- 
our of all the common people, if left at liberty, the fhipwreck- 
ed have always found protection and fafety from the beft fa- 
milies. 

Tradition tells us of the remarkable ftature, ftrength, and 
valour, of John the Great, the laird of Coil's predeceffor. 
He, in feveral battles, conquered the Macneils of Barra, who 
pretended right to his lands, and eftablifhed himfelf in the 
heritage, handed down to him from Macdonald of the Ifles. 
The Macniels burying-grounds are pointed out to day, in 
many places in Coll. Though Neil his brother was not near 
equal in ftrength, he could raife to his breaft three ftones, on 
top of each other, weighing at leaft 16 cwt. The ftones re- 
main ftill at the place. 

A country man, who died laft year about 5 feet 10 inches 
high, was employed by the laird of Coll as poft to Glafgow 
or Edinburgh. His ordinary burden thence to Coll was 16 
ftone. Being once ftopt at a toll near Dumbarton, he hu- 
moroufly afked whether he fhould pay for a burden, and up- 
on being anfwered in the negative, carried his horfe in his 
arms paft the toll. 

Indeed, though of an ordinary fize, the people are remark- 
able for agility. They frequently entertain themfelves by 
compofing and finging fongs, by repeating Fingalian and 
other tales, by dancing aflemblies at different farms by turns. 
In this qualification they are remarkably neat. They are ve- 
ry chearful and humorous, and there are not above two or 
three of either fex corpulent in either ifle. 

Poor 



of Tiry. 



Poor and Schools. — They are very attentive to the poor in 
ficknefs and want. They rarely have cafh, but liberally be- 
fiow grain, &amp;c. The kirk feffion funds do not afford to 
give annually above 3 s. to each of 50 poor in Tiry, and 34- 
in Coll. There are alfo j s. or 6 s. allowed to help their in- 
terments. 

Whatever thefe Iflanders may be behind their neighbours, 
any where on the mainland, is wholly owing to their great 
difad vantages, as to education. I hope the period is now 
arrived when the cloud fhall be difpelled. Till lately there 
were only 10I. of a parochial falary for a fchool. Nine 
years ago, the Society ih Scotland for Propagating Chriftian 
Knowledge, beftowed 10 1. for another fchool. Thefe two. 
fchools generally had not ten fcholars each. The people 
had not tafte for education, and there were complaints againft 
the teachers. The Society have, fince the Reverend Dr 
Kemp's vifit, added- to thefe falaries a fum that enables the 
teachers to teach all gratis, and beftowed a number of books 
upon them. The Duke of Argyle is pleafed to add fo much 
for provisions which the parifh mould make. A falary is 
now granted, by the Society, for a fchool in Coll. I doubt 
not but they fhail henceforth be all well attended, if the 
fchoolmafters be well chofen. There are now often from 60 
to 80 fcholars in each. From whatever fource funds may 
be obtained to accomodate this parifh properly, Tiry requires 
4 fchools and Coll two. 

Our congregations were untaught fingers, till the begin- 
ning of this year. An itinerant church mufic teacher, with 
a fmall falary, employed by the Society for Propagating 
Chriftian Knowledge, was fent for. He teaches at fo cheap 
a rate, that it is belived 800 or 900 in the parifh will attend 
him this year. The good effeas may be great. Singing is

already become agreeable, even to the old and illiterate. 
Men at 70 years of age attend. , 

Sewing fchools, and efpecially fpinning fchools, are much 
required, as the women in general are very backward in 
thefe refpecls *. 

Emigration. — Thirty-fix men, women, and children, emi- 
grated from Coll to America in 1792. None hitherto has 
emigrated from Tiry, though fome talk of doing fo. Their 
crops failed in 1790 and 179 1, which, together with the 
low prices of kelp and cattle, has much reduced them. They 
rauft foon go fomewhere for relief, unlefs manufactures be 
introduced to employ them. 

Ferries. — There is a ftated ferry between Tiry and Coll, 
often very dangerous, owing to a heavy fvvell from the At- 
lantic, to rapid currents and amazing breakers, over rocks 
and fhifting fands. There is a Mated ferry between Coll and 
Mull, 8 or 12 miles to the landing places. It is dangerous, 
on account of rapid currents at Loch-Iothurn and the point 
of Caileach in Mull, and difficult of accefs to the harbours. 
There is no ftated ferry between Tiry and Mull. The fhort- 
eft diftance from land to land is 21 miles ; but above 30 be- 
tween the ufual landing places. The fare for a ftout boat 
and hands here, is from 12 s. to 15 s. For travelling cor- 
refpondence and markets, there is great need of a packet be- 
tween thefe ifles and Mull, efpecially if Tobermory, the 
neareft poft office town, increafes. It is to be hoped, when

the Crinan canal will be finilhed, that there will be an in- 
creafe or trade 111 all the weitern ifles, and that then, inftead 
of alking a falary, fome may find it their intereft to apply 
for leave to keep packets. The run from Tiry to Crinan, 
by the welt fide of IViull, will be flraight, and hardly ex- 
ceeding 90 miies. Such a packet would find her bufinefs 
daily increafe, from coals, marble, fi'fh, beef, potatoes, &amp;c. 

Church and Stipend. — There are three places of worfhip in 
the panfh. The ftipends hitherto have not exceeded 50 L 
together with 16 1. 13 s. 4 d. in lieu of a manfe, glebe, 'and 
communion elements. There is alfo a falary of 33 1. 6s. 3d. gi- 
ven to an Affiltant in Coll. The whole teinds of the parifh, by 
decreets 1726, 1729, and 1733, are 211 bolls victual, two- 
thirds bear, and one third oat meal, together with 294 1. 5 s. 
6 d. Scotch. The ip/a corpora (tipend, or tenth part, was ta- 
ken up fo late as 1752. There is now a procefs of augmen- 
tation commenced. At Sorbie in i'iry was the mother church 
of the deanry of the ifles. 

Advantages and Difadvant.iges. — The only advantages we 
can be faid to have, are, that the proprietors of thefe ifles 
have alw ys rnanifefted an inclination that their tenants fhould 
live comfortably ; that our lands, though impoverished, are ve- 
ry improveable; and that the filhiug, if encouraged andattend- 
ed to, may be very confiderable. The circumftances of not get- 
ting lalt without great plague and danger, and the markets turn- 
ing out badly, when the hrft attempts were made, have difcour- 
aged the natives ; whereas, in their fituation, they require not 
only tfee countenance of the law, but even aid, at firft, to pur- 
chaie lines, harpoons, &amp;c. It is neceffary alfo to improve 
the harbours. For this purpofe, many veflels that frequent 
the ifland would chearfully pay a fmall anchorage, even with-

XN old writings the name of the parifh is Pennycook, now 
commonly Pennycuik, faid to fignity in Gaelic Gouk's 
(or Cuckoo's) Hill, probably from the number ot thefe birds 
that haunt the lurrounding woods in fpring. It was the opi- 
nion of the late worthy Sir James Clerk, that a former pro- 
prietor, principal heritor of the parifli, gave it this name 
after his ownj but that the original one was St Mungo's, fin 
Norwegian Dear Friend,) the name given to St Kentigern by 
Servanus, Bilhop of Orkney, by whom he was educated about 
the middle of the 6th century *.

There are the remains of two chapels in the parifh, Si 
Mary's, at a place called Monklothian, at the S. and St Ca- 
therine's at the N end of the parifh ; each of thefe has a bu- 
rying place. On one fide of a recefs on the S. of Fentland 
Hills to the weltward, and at the edge of an old track lead- 
ing over to the N fide of thefe hills, on an eminence called 
the Crofs Sword, is a ftone of an oblong fquare figure, 2 feet 
10 inches by 3 feet, and about 1 foot thick, funk into the

and 9 inches deep, fuppofed to have been the pedeftal of a

mer, but larger, with an oval bafon 20 inches by 10, fcoojed 
out of the middle, and two niches on one fi le apparently for 
a perfon's knees. It is called by the country people the-Font 
Stone. The name of the hill on which it is placed is- called 
Monk's Ridge. It is alfo at the fide of an old path, leading 
over in the fame direction with the former, called Monk's 
Road. The original feat of the old proprietors of St Mun- 
go's is ftill to be traced on an eminence above the Efk, and

imity to Peeblesfhire, which was in the diocefe of G jfgow, 
fhow, that this pariili was originally church land, and con- 
firm the opinion that it took its name from the Saint above 
mentioned. 

Extent., Soil, &amp;c— The parifh- is extenfive, being n or ia 
miles long and 6 broad, but in manv places interfered by 
large corners of other parithes. The Elk runs through the 
middle of it from W. to E. and almolt divides the parifh. 
The Pentland Hills ftretch fro.n E. to W. upon the north- 
fide of the parifh. The higheit of thefe hills is 1600 feet 
above the level of the fea at Leith. — The foil is various, con- 
futing of ciay, gravel, fand, and mots, with their combina- 
tions. There is but little wheat railed in the parifh; oats, and 
barley, peafe, turnips, and potatoes, fucceed well, but grafS 
feems to be the moft profitable crop ; the others fhould bs 
attended to only in order to affift its growth. Upon the beft 
and low grounds of ihe pariih, the following rotation of crops 
will anfwer, viz* iff. fallow, turnips or potatoes ; 2d, bar- 
ley with clover and rye grafs ; 3d, hay, one crop only, as the 
clover generally fails the fecond crop ; 4th, oats. It is found 
that wafhing the milk dilhes with water in which a little falt- 
petre has been diflolved, entirely removes the inconvenience 
to the dairy from turnip feeding, and takes away the dif- 
agreeable tafte it is' ,ipr to produce in the milk. — The two 
horfe chain ploughs with the curved mould board, for imr- 
proved, and the Scotch plough, for unimproved, ground, arc 
thofe commonly ufed. The Iheep are much of the fame fort, 
and treated in the fame manner, as thofe in Linton parifh*.

Church and Poor. — The church is a neat handfome build- 
ing, at the eaft end of the village, with a portico fupported 
by 4 doric pillars ; on the top of which is a figure of a crofs 
in ftone, that occafioned fome uneafinefs, at the time of its 
erection, to the enemies of popery. There is on the front 
of the portico the word Bethel well cut in Hebrew charac- 
ters, which likewiie gave fome offence. It was built in 1771, 
before the cotton mill, and, on that account, is now too fmall 
for the parifh. Sir John Clerk of Pennycuick is patron. Mr 
Thomas M«Courty, formerly minifter of Dolphington, was 
admitted here, 17th January 1772. The ftipend is 78 1 3 s. 
6-j- d. all paid in money, befides a manfe and glebe worth 
about jol. or 12L per annum. There are now 21 poor perfons 
upon the feffion roll, but often many more. They are fup- 
ported from the intereft of fome money belonging to the fef- 
fion, by the hire of a hearfe, and of a mortcloth, and by 
the weekly collections at the church door, extending all at 
a medium to about 28 1. per annum j but amounting, for- 
merly, to a larger fum, when the family refided conftantly 
at Pennyc iick Houfe. 

Villages, Inns, and Roads — There is only one village in the 
parifh; the new part of which, at a little diftance from the 
old, was built to accommodate the people belonging to the 
cotton mill. There is a neat fmall inn about the middle of 
the old town, which was a good deal frequented by parties 
of pleafure, from Edinburgh, in fummer, to fee the Houfe of 
Pennycuick, and its fine paintings, particularly Offian's Hall, 
and the pleafure ground around the houle. It muft be ob- 
ferved that there are too many dram fhops, to which the peo- 
ple often refort, and are in danger of deftroying themfelves 
by taking too much of that poifonous liquor, cheap whifky, 
by which both their health and morals are greatly injured, and'

their families much ftraitened Two roads pafs through the 
parifh ; one to Linton or Biggar, about 2 miles to the N. of 
the village along the foot of the Pentland hills. The other 
3bout a mile to the S. E. pafTes through Howgare, and di- 
vides into two roads, the one leading to Peebles, and the 
other to Nobkhonfe. To this, at Howgate, a bye road has 
lately been made from the village of Pennycuick, which will 
be of great fervice. A communication is alfo at prefent form- 
ing, from the Linton road acrofs the hills, which will give 
accefs to the eaftern parts of the parifli, on the other fide of 
a range of mountains, over which their has hitherto been 
no eaiy paffage. 

Fuel, &amp;c — The fuel is coal and peat, of both which there 
is plenty in the parifh, but the coal is not wrought. Coals 
are brought from Loanhead, Whitehill, Hawthorndeen, and 
fometimes from Carlops. Theycoft at the pit 5 d. 6 d and 
7 d per 2 cwt or load, according to thtir quality. The 
peats are driven to Edinburgh for fale. There are fomc na- 
tural woods on the fides of the Elk. There are feveral Chaly- 
beate fprings ; and on the S. fide of the Efk, among the 
woods oppofire to the Spittal hill, is a clear well of a bitterifh 
tafte, fu^poled to have both an emetic and cathartic quality. 
It is reforted to by the common people for bowel complaints, 
faintings,diforders in the blood, cancers, &amp;x. and of courfe is 
faid to have performed many wonderful cures. On the flope 
of a hill, on the S. fide of the river, oppofite to the W. end 
of the Spittal hill, is alfo another fpring of a ftrong petrify- 
ing quality, where it oozes out of the ground it has a white 
appearance, feen at a confiderable diftance on the Linton 
road. A little way below this, where the river iffues from 
between thefe two hills, a village is begun, to be built by Mr

* Antiquities, hc. — In former times there appears from the re- 
mains of towers and manfions fcattered up and down, to have 
been many proprietor!, of confequence in this parifh, whofe hiftory 
is now lolt. On the S. fide of the river, and beyond a confiderable 
glen oppofue to Pennycuick Houie- are the remains of old Ravenf- 
no k. once the property ot Oliver Sinclair, brother to the laird of 
Ri'flin, who, being appointed commander in chief by King James 
tht V was defeated, and taken pfifoner at the battle of Solway 
Mofs, in November 1542. Aooul a mile further up, on the N. 
fide of the river, but high above it, are the remains of a large 
irregular building, (wliu h appears to have been intended for de- 
fence, and fui rounded with a ditth), called Bruntllone Caftk 3 , 
faid to have been inhabited by the predecefibrs of the Earls of 
Dumfries. It is certain, that, in the 16th century, it was in the 
poffcffion ot a family of the name of Crichton ; and according- 
ly, in one place, is the date 1568, with correfponding initial-, 
but on the oldeft part of the building are Hill to be feen the 
Douglas arms. Near to this was lately lou^d an arrow-head 
of flmt, ragled on the edges and barbed, about 2 inches long 
and one. broad, which is now in the houfe of Pennycuick. N. 
W. from this houfe, there feems to have been a town in which 
fome perfons ot confequence refided, as likewife two others, viz. 
Braidwood and Welfhrown, in a weltern diredticn from the lair, 
but ot .thefe no accounts have been obtained. At the N, end of 
the parifh, up the water of Glencrof., is a ruin, remarkable for 
thick walls and fmall narrow windows, called Lodging Hirfe, 
faid to have been a hunting feat of one of the James's. About 
half a mile further W. arc the remains of another building, 
comm nly called the Houlets Houfe, of which no certain ac- 
count is to be found. Two miles It ill farther W on the R fide 
of the lulls, is another building, called Bavelaw, once applied 
to the lame ufe alfo by one of thefe kings, which is ft'iU entire, 
and was, lately inhabited By the former proprietor Mr Scott, but 
is now the property of David Johntton of Laithrifk. South 
from this, one of tlie Pentland hills takes the name of Spittal ; 
on the N. of which, and at the fide of the Uream. are the vef- 
tiges o| the Old Spittal or Hofpital Houfe. As the prel'ent 
houfe is removed to the neighbourhood of the Linton and 
Monk's Rigg Roads, the benighted traveller is ftill conlidered 
as having a right to protection, and one of the out houl'es, with

Pennycukk Houfe. — Tins edifice was built about 1761 by 
the late very refbeftable proprietor formerly mentioned, (Sir 
James Clerk, Bart). It ftands upon a flat above the Elk, 
and by taking advantage of a turn in the river, the back 
front looks up the glen formed by its banks, to the ruins of 
Bruntfione Caftle, and the weftern extremity of the Pent- 
land Hills. In a fiat immediately below the Houfe, in the 
fame direction, is an artificial piece of water, and the garden 
with extenfive green and hothoufes. Both fides of the river 
are diverfified with eminences and glens, and the afcents be- 
hind the garden, and on the oppofite fide of the river, are 
entirely covered with wood. The front of the Houfe is or- 
namented with a handfome portico fupported by eight co- 
lumns, having a flight of fteps on each fide defended by ba- 
luftrades. The materials were brought from the Mairfield 
Quarry near the upper end of the parifh. The roof is co- 
vered with lead, and a row of vales are placed on the top. 
In the Houfe are a good number of Roman antiquities cut 
in ftone, part of which were brought from a Roman camp at 
Netherby, and fome from Graham's Dyke.— The front of 
the offices lies nearly diagonally to, at the diftance of 280

fiding proprietor of Spittal, of the name of Ofwald, was acci- 
dentally fhot in the back by his fcrvant, who was following him 
to Sl.pper Field Loch, for the purpofe of killing wild ducks. 
"When the houfe of Pennycukk was building, Adrun \Va:kens, 
the Kind's printer, and -.mother gentleman, had gone up on the 
Lord's day to fee how far the work was advanced, and on their 
return, were both firuck by lightning to the ground ; Adrian

a woman fitting by the fire with a child n her arms, at her 
brealt,was firuck dead by lightning; the child having recc.yed

along the northern declivity to the river, exhibits one of the 
moft. luxuriant and firiking fcenes any where to be feeq. 
About one eighth of a mile above the garden, a timber bridge 
formerly crofled the river, at the S. end of which is the en- 
try into a fubterranean paflage, called Hurly Cove, 49 yards 
long, 7 feet high, and 6 feet broad; in the middle of which, 
on the W. fide, is a dark cell with feats cut round, capable 
of containing 6 or 8 people, the whole being cut out of the 
folid rock in 1 742. Ac the S. end are the remains of a 
fmall fummer-houfe, where was a little kitchen and dining 
room ; and in the front is a pond flored with perch and trout. 
The large plantations of trees of various kinds, in fummer, 
form a moft beautiful amphitheatre *.

fame fide of the river, was, in 1529, in pofkfiion of a family of 
the name of Cnchtoun. Jq 1646, it belonged to DrPennycuick 
wno was alfo proprietor of Romanno, '.and is noticed in his 
works. In 1702, it pafied from him to Mr Oliphant, by whom 
it was the following year transferred to Sir David Forbes, from

irregular cafile, and with its appendages covered the whole 
breadth oi the point on which it itands, formed by a deep re- 
cefs on ei'hcr fide running up towards the hills from the glen 
behind : The ground floor in the front of the prefent building 
made a part of one of its towers ; it is arched above with flits 
for defence on every fide, and its wall is fo flrong as in one 
place to have a clofet cut out of its thicknefs. On the N. over- 
hanging the eaflern recefi,, through which defcends a rivulet, 
fome vaults are left underneath the remains of a fmall round 
tower, «nd over the Weltern, which is dry, was the chapel and 
pTifon, which laff. is ftiil remembered to have been ufed for re- 
fractory coalliers. — In the time of Dr Pennycuick, fome parties 
from General Monk's army are reported to .have been detach- 
ed to this neighbourhood, and diflinguifhed a Qream that en- 
ters the glen in feveral confiderahle falls about a mile to the E. 
Jt is known by the name of Monkfburn ; the hill from which it 
defcends by this tradition, was from hence called Monk's Rigg, 
and' the gh*de, through which the Eflc winds at its mouth, 
Monk's Haugh. A little below this, furrounded with riling 
knolls, and on three of its lides by the wooded banks of the ri- 
ver fweeping round far beneath, is a clear and deep lake with- 
out any vifible fupply or outlet. At the meeting of two glens 
farther up, and to the S. of Monkfbum, is a lingular reck, re- 
fembling a lower, called the Harbour Craig, on which are 
rudely carved a number of names, and dates correfponding to 
the time of the Commonwealth, f»id to have been the work of 
fame of the Covenantee who took fhelter about it. The build- 
ing fecrns to have remained unaltered till the time of Mr For- 
bes, when molt of the old cafile was pulled down, and the pre- 
fent double Houfe creeled in its (lead in imitation of the Houfe 
of Cullodcn. What makes thefe particulars very interefling, is, 
that at this time the place was dillinguiflied by being chofen for 
the fcenes of the celebrated pafloral comedy of the Gentle Shep- 
herd. ' While i paffed my infancy at New Hall,' fays Mr Tyt-

late, however, the winters have been uncommonly mild, but 
the fummers have been cold, fhort, and unprolific. There 
is not much rain through the year, but when it does fall it 
is generally in heavy (howers. At 12 noon, 5th September 
1788, Farenheit's thermometer rofe to 73 0 in the fhade, 
and 8o° in the fun at New Hall. In the higher parts of the 
parifli the crops are precarious, and the grafs luxuriant, fo 
that ift is chiefly adapted for pafture. Tuere are plenty of 
peat and coal, throughout the whole parifh, for fuel. Above 
Monkfburn, where there is a particular kind of freeftone re- 
fembling petuntle, there is abundance of lime, granite, iron, 
and freeftone intermixed with ftrata of clay, clay marl, gra-

' honourable friend Sir James Clerkof Pennycnick, where Ram- 
« fay frequently refided, and who, I know, is poflelTed of feveral 
' original poems compofed by him, can give the lame teftimo- 
' ny.' The hollow, beyond a place called Mary's Bower, where 
the Efk forms a line or fall, is named the How Burn; and, with 
its bathing pool and fcenery, coincides exactly with the dcfcrip- 
tion of Habbie's How; in all probability a cottager of that, 
name had his hut there at that time. The grounds beyond to 
the weftward called Carlops, a contraction for Carline's Loups, 
now a part of the fame eftate, were fuppofed once to have been 
the refidence of a Carline or witch, who lived in a dell at the 
foot of the Carlops Hill, where a village is now begun near a 
pafs between two conic rocks: From the oppofite points of which 
flie was often obferved at nights, by the frightened and difoi der- 
ed eye of fuperftition and ignorance, leaping and fnfking acrofs 
the entrance. This tradition with the dell or glen, to the N. 
of the fuppofed witch's hut, coincides with, and probably gave 
rife to, another part of the ftory. From thefe circumilances, 
and the manners, employments, and drei's, of the old inhabi- 
tants, the title of the former proprietor, the flicker given to the 
Covenanters before the Reiteration, the number of glens, 
ftreams, rocks, and cafcades, together with the verdure and

vel, and fand ; and in the Carlops Hill have been found 
fkiall quantities of lead and iron ore. Some of the lime-rocks 
in the upper part of the parifli are fo hard and entire as to 
anfwer the purpofes of marble, of which, when polifhed, they 
make very beautiful fpecimens. There are alfo lome ftrata 
of rotten whinficne, and fuch as are fought after for mill- 
ftones. Chalybeate fprings are frequent, befides the mineral 
and petrifying or encrufting fprings already mentioned. 1 he 
ftreams afford plenty of trout and iome eels, and the lake is 
full of perch and pike. In the channel of Monkfburn alone 
are veins of freeftone, mill-ftone, coal, clay, fand, four veins 
of ironftone, two of limeftone, gravel, and granite. In a bed 
of clay, above the undermoft lime rock, were found feveral 
entire petrified fhells, refembling the mytilus anat 'mus ; and in 
a ftratum of limeftone up the Elk at the How Lin, fome 
pieces of petrified wood with imperfect fpecimens of the my a 
and helix of Linnaeus. Several figured ftones, fuch as thofe 
defcribed in the account of Blantyre, have prefented them- 
felves both in the common freeftone and that like petuntfe ; 
they are fomewhat cylindrical, either with regular rows of 
equidiftant and alternate pits, or with net-work railed like 
the coat of a melon : The lurrounding cafe of ftone is the fame

lar net-work, interfperfed with round, oblong, and pointed 
projections, all over one of its fides, on a general view, hav-

Mifccllaneous Obfervailor.s. — On the N. fide of the Linton 
road, on an eminence between it and the hills about the 10th 
mile Itonc from Edinburgh, are the remains of an oval camp 
84 by 67 yards within, inclofing a number of tumuli 1 1 yards 
each in diameter. It has three entries, one to the W. and 
one on each iide to the N. and S. but none at the end to the 
E. The N. entrance is 6 and the other two 4 yards each in 
width. It is eucompafTed by two ditches, itaeh 4 yards wide, 
with a mound of 6 yards in breadth betwem them; and the 
name it ufually gets among the country p jple is the Caftie. 
There is a fimilar encampment at the fide of the Harkin- 
burn within the woods of Pennycuick. They are probably 
of Britifii origin, conftructed either for the protection of 
cattle or for defence in war. In Tweeddale fuch entrench- 
ments, of which there are feveral of various dimenfions, arc 
known by the appellation of Rings. 

From inattention to the unevennefs of the furface, the 
turnpike roads are fall of pulls, and are extremely fatiguing 
and irkfome to travellers; the bye roads are alfo few, and in 
very bad repair. The great objection to the old roads, are, 
that they are ill conducted, ill made, and narrow. To every 
perfon of fenfe it mult appear obvious, that till a road is ren- 
dered eafy and accefiible, it would be abfurd and fooliih in 
the extreme to wafte and fquander the money of the public 
on improvements, which would be comparatively of little 
confequence ; the fir ft object, therefore, ought to be to re- 
move the pulls, and flatten the road as much as pofiible, fo as to 
render travelling eafy and expeditious, then to make and 
keep it in repair, and laft of all to make it wide and hand- 
fbme. When the road is finiftied acrofs the hills, one of the

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1009861">KIRKCONNEL</name>*. 

(County and Synod of Dumfries. — Prejbytery of Pen- 

pont.J 



By the Reverend Mr John Robertson, Minijler.</head> 

<p>Origin of the Name. 

•^^HIS parifh is naturally fuppofed to derive its name from 
£- the firft kirk f erected in it, as either built by Ronald 
Connel, commonly called St Connel, or named in honour of 

him, 

* Thi3 Account had the following Introduction prefixed to 
it; and Mr Robertfon having infilled either to have his Ac- 
count returned, or the following obfervations printed with it; 
as the one could not be complied with, it was neccifary to obey 
his injunctions in regard to the other. 

INTRODUCTION. 

Pulchrum ejl benefacere rcipuUicae ; ctiam bencdicere, huud abfttrdum

f In the Teutonic, it is kirche ; in Dutch, kerke ; and in Sax- 
on, kirke; all evidently from the Greek, Kv£i» Otxtt, the houfe 
of the Lord. So that the word, kirk, is in reality much more 
legitimate and obvious in its meaning than church, which is no- 
thing elfe but an unnatural and baibarous corruption of the ori- 
ginal word kirk.

method of acquiring a full and accurate knowledge of the in- 
ternal Rate of this country ; and thereby to wake ihe dormant 
principles, and direct the benign operations of philanthropy and 
genuine patriotifm, is a circumftance that does infinite credit to 
the character of that author, who firft fet on foot, and has 
taken on himfelf, the trouble of publifhing thefe Statiftical In- 
velligations. — Confonant to this fingular felicity of contrivance, 
and excellence of deiign, are the ardour, and afliduity, exerted 
in conducting the execution, and haftening on the completion 
of the plan propofed. 

As congenial to minds of this amiable and beneficent difpofi- 
tion, the Clergy of Scotland mull enjoy a proportionate degree 
of pleafure, the more they have it in their pewer, to affilt in 
carrying on fo arduous and laudable an undertaking. Upon the 
fame principle, where materials of inftruclive and entertaining 
information are wanting, or few, or of fmall importance} by the 
rule of contraries, we cannot but feel a fimilar proportion of 
painful mortification. To this may be added, that, to an effayift, 
in hiilory or topography, the influence of this kind ot penury is 
equally inaufpicious and deprefling, as that of 'he pecuniary fort 
in common life ; of which, to this purpofe, Plautus, I think, 
fomewhere fays : 

In extrema inopia confiitutis, baud facile eft emergere: 

Which fentence the Satyrifl has turned into the following hexa- 
meter : 

Haud facile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obftat 
Res angufla donii Juvenal. 

Where poverty fpreads out her night, 
How hard 's th' attempt to rife to light ! 
How can the mind exert her pow'rs, 
Where want in chilling horrors lours I 

Nor yet is either abundance, or equality, to be always expefled, 
in the one cafe more than in the other. No; far from it. By 
the uniform and univerfal deflination and arrangement of Pro- 
vidence, there is a wide and evident difference of powers and 

advantages.

and 3 or 4 miles from the high road. — From the name of 
this parifh, the firname Kirkconnel unqueitionably originates ; 
which fuggefts another very probable conclufion, that the 
chief of that family was, in old times, proprietor of the whole 
or greateft part of this parifh. This fuppofition is not a 

little 

advantages, both mental and cnrpdreal, among mankind. From 
this natural and necefT.iry difference ariies, and mult anfe, a 
correfpondent diverfity of property, rank, and power, in fociety. 
The fame thing will refult even from the general inequality of 
fituation, foil, and climate. Nor can any one need lo be told, 
how milch both the natural and political ftate of one country, 
and of one part of the fame country, will vary from that of an- 
other, nay even from itfelf, at different periods of time, and in 
the common courfe of human affairs.— Hence, too, as to fub- 
je&amp;s of detail and defcription, as well as articles of produce, 
there will alwiys be found an equally remarkable diverfity ; to 
which, in both cafes, the poet's obfervation may well enough be 
fuppofed very aptly to allude, in this line : 

Net vero terrae ferre cMtnes omnia ■ • ojfunt. ViRG. 

Not ev'ry foil can ev'ry produce yields 
Nor is each fpot we tread, a claflic field. 

Far lefs is it to be thought, that the remote, wild, mountainous 
parts of a northern country, fuch as Scotland, canfurnifh much, 
to employ the pencil of the artift, or enrich the page of hittory. 
Such is the unfavourable fituation of the prefent writer The 
field, within his province, lies much retired irom public life ; 
was formerly almolt. inacceliible, and very little meliorated by 
culture and improvement ; and contains few fcenes or objects, 
few monuments of facls or events, any way linking or intereft- 
ing, either for landkape painting, or entertaining narrative — 
Thus circumftanced, he cannot but feel and regret the difadvan- 
tage of fuch a fituation. Yet, loth to decline the talk which 
falls to his fhare, he readily recurs to the old approved maxim, 
in the words of the poet : 

Ut defmt vires, tamen eji laudanda voluntas-— —Ovid. 

With each defect, the will acceptance claims ; 
Which candour gives, when peevifh humour blames.

little confirmed by the confideration, that there are lands, in 
different parifhes of this (hire and its vicinity, named Kirk- 
connel, doubtlefs from the fame family. Of the lands thus 
named, the moft confiderable is, the eftate of Kirkconnel, in 
the parifh of Troqueer, and ftewartry of Galloway. The 
proprieror of this eftate was formerly Kirkconnel of that Ilk ; 
but afterwards Maxwell of Kirkconnel, in confequence of a 
marriage, between the heirefs and a gentleman who was a 
branch of the Nithfdale family *. 

Form, Extent^ Surface, Hills, C3V. — The form of the parifh 
is pretty regular : Its breadth, along the great -road from 
weft to eaft, is between 7 and 8 miles ; and its length, from 
north to fbuth, between 10 and 14 miles. Almoft parallel 
with the high road, and 3 or 4 miles from it, on the north 
fide, there is a continued range of hills irregularly formed, 
and of confiderabie height, which run the whole length of 
the p.u*ifh, from eaft to weft; where they are connected with 
Corfencone, in the parifh of New Cumnock, a higher hill 
than any of them, which terminates the range on that fide. 
Thefe hills are moftly green ; and on the north fide extend 
into high, cold, fwampy ground, or a continuation of irregu- 
lar hills, covered with grafs and heath, and interfperfed with 
narrow valleys, deep glens, and winding rivulets. From the 
bafe of the above range, on the fouth fide, there is an exten- 
live and pretty gradual declivity, in fome places interrupted 
with large fiats and deep hollows, and ftretching down to

the river Nith, a little below the high way. On the other 
fide of this river, the ground rifes to a ftill greater height, and 
a much wider extent, towards another range of far more 
diilant hills, the tops of which form the termination of the 
profpeel on the fouth. 

Climate, S$il, Cultivation, Cattle, and Produce.— -From the 
elevated fituation of the parifh, and the number and height 
of its hills, the air is naturally moift and cold ; fometimes 
frofty early in harveft, and late in the fpring ; yet generally 
pure, owing to the declivity of the ground, the rapidity of 
the rivers and brooks, and the frequency of frefh breezes 
and high winds. As in other parts of the country, the foil 
here is much diverfified ; conufting of light gravelly mould, 
loam, clay, mofs, and a mixture of mofs and clay ; and in 
general it is cold, mar (by, and deep. There are above 600 
acres in tillage. Light land is tilled with the Englifh plough 
drawn by two horfes, and deep land with the Scottifh plough 
drawn by four horfes. The mofTy land requires to be very 
early ploughed. Seed time begins about the end of March, 
and harveft work in the end of Auguft. Except two or three 
farms from 40 1. down to 30 1 of rent, and the like number 
of ftill fmaller value, there are none entirely corn farms in 
the parifh ; the reft being ftocked with fheep, and all of 
them with a proportion of black cattle. The number of 
the former will be about 13000; and of the latter above 
700, old and young. The beft fort of fheep weigh from 50 
to 60 lib. and the fmaller kind from 38 to 45 lib. or more. 
The rate of laying, or fmearing them, is, 6 lib. of butter with 
7 Scotch pints of tar for each fcore, which yield annually 
between 50 and 60 lib. of wool. The beft kind of wool is 
fold for 8 s. per ftone, and the inferior fort for 5 s. or upwards, 
to 6 s. 6 d. The grain and roots, chiefly cultivated here, are 

oats, 



Statiflical Account 



oats, bear, and potatoes, with a fmall quantity of peafe, rye- 
grafs, clover, and flax. Seldom, however, do the cr.ips, 
though apparently ftrong and heavy, come to perfection; 
owing to the high winds, frofls, and mildews, to which this 
parifh is very much fubject. The unconfined wandering of 
fheep, and other cattle, in the winter time, is a ftrong check 
to the fowing of much rye-grafs and clover. Nor is the 
cultivation of lint lefs difcouraged, by the carelefs or difho- 
neft management of it at the lint-mill ; the quantity returned 
ufually bearing fo fmall a proportion to what has been fent 
thither, as to exceed all belief, and in fome inftances to be 
perfectly fhameful, and to carry the appearance of jeft, banter^ 
or iniult, as well as of fraud and plunder. This, however, by 
no means alludes to the lint-mill at Morton. 

Improvements and Di '[advantages, — "Within thefe 20 years, 
agriculture has been carried on here to a much greater extent 
than formerly, by means of lime brought from a quarry, be- 
longing to the Larl of Dumfries, about 5 miles from the cen- 
ter of this parifh. At prefent, however, it leems to be much 
on the decline. For mod of the land capable of improve- 
ment has been limed, and will not fo well admit of a repeated 
operation in that way, except where the foil is dry, and af- 
ter a crop of turnips or potatoes. The ftruggle, too, with 
an unfriendly climate ftill fubhfts; though no doubt it might 
be greatly diminifhed by means of ditches, quick-fet hedges, 
and broad belts of planted wood, at convenient diftances, and 
ih a proper direction j as it is ufually obferved that, under 
this kind of fhelter, even the froft makes no impreffion, when, 
in expofed fituations, juicy plants are quite blafted all around. 
Yet, effectual and valuable as this fpecies of improve. \ent 
would certainly be found, it is more than can be expected 
from tenants, whofe leafes extend no farther than 19 years ;

without an adequate allowance for the labour and expence, 
with which it would be attended. But the greateft difcour- 
agement of all is, the exorbitant advance upon the price of 
labour, particularly fervants wages, which in general are now- 
tripled, beyond what they were within the above period : 
Efpecially, as this is connected with a nearly fimilar rife in 
the price of horfes, hufbandry utenfils, artificers work, and 
wearing apparel; to f t y nothing of imports for revenue and. 
roads, the rife of rents, and the expenlive difference in the 
prefent ftile of living 

Minerals. 

* All this muff bear very hard upon the corn-farmer, and at 
lair quite overpower all his rfForts in the unequal conflict; con- 
fidering too that the price of grain is at this day much the 
famt th it it was 20 or 30 years ago. Thus circumllanced, how 
can he but fink down under the incumbent weight of fuch a 
combination of difcouragement from every quarter? And if he 
fall, how can the landed proprietor ftand, or the neceffitous poor 
jive? For, fuppoling matters to go on in this train, the con- 
fequence is obvious: Agriculture muft fall into decay, how far 
no one can tell; the country will turn wild and barren, wdl be 
defol ited and depopulated; grain become fcarce, and rife in 
price beyond the reach of thofe who cannot work, or are noc 
employed ; and the kingdom at large be reduced to want .nd 
difhtfs. What elffe' is to be expected, when the very money, 
paid by the farmer and others, for ftatute labour and at toli-bars, 
is employed againlt him to augment his hardth ps, by being 
lavifhly held out 111 tempting offers to his fervants and 1 ibour- 
ers, to entice 'hern from his work, and induce them to go to 
the making and repan mg of the great roads; efpecially, when 
the mineries, tounderies, and the like great works, above all the 
cotton manufactures, all around, particularly in the weft, have 
fwept the count! y quite bare of hands, and feem as it they 
could ftill keep it in the fame (ituation? For not only fervants 
and labourers, but I k- wife mechanics, of all forts, are now re- 
linquilhmg their refpedive occupations, and betaking themfelves 
to aifferent departments in the cotton manufacture, or are em- 
ployed in hawking, or otherwife extending, the fale of its vari- 
ous articles all over the co intry. This general defertion of

facture is in fo far valuable, as it contributes to the extenfion of 
commerce, produces the conveniences of live, furnifhes employ- 
ment to the labouring poor, and bids fair to be permanen: ; 
but it is rather unfortunate, when one fort happens to interfere 
with the interefl of another; ftill more, when it detaches the 
public attention from others of equal or greater importance to 
the community, or proves a wafting drain to that proportion 
of manual labour, which is neceffary to the very exiftence of 
thofe of a more interefting nature ; fuch as, in the prefent cafe, 
agriculture, and the woollen manufacture, of all others the molt 
important to this country. The fuperior importance of agri- 
culture is obvious at firft view. It produces a very great addi- 
tion to the beauty and value of the country ; rears a healthy 
race of men for its defence ; fecures plenty of provifions for its 
inhabitants ; and prevents all that anxiety, diftrefs, and cala- 
mity, that ufually attend too much dependence on a foreign mar- 
ket. This laft mentioned circumftance claims the moft ferious 
confederation, as nothing can be more vain than to amnfe us 
with falfe comfort, by turning our attention to other countries 
for relief, in cafe of need, fuch as the prefent ftate of agricul- 
ture in Scotland feems too ftrongly to prefage ; becaufe nothing 
can be more precarious, delufive, and dangerous to any peo- 
ple, efpecially in an infular fuuation, than fuch dependence. 

Next to agriculture, the 'woollen mamifatture yzSiV] demands a 
place, in the fcale of national importance. Without wading in- 
to the depths of commercial and political difcuftion on the fub- 
jedl, or even noticing that partiality in favour of any ftaple com- 
modity of our own country, which is fo natural and allowable 
in itfelf, and due from every Briton ; it is enough to obferve, 
that wool, the produce of the very fpot where we live, is not 
liable to any of thofe difaftrous or adverfe accidents, which are 
fo much connected with the importation of foreign materials, 
efpecially, at a great diftance ; and which may plunge the prin- 
cipal adventurer in difappointment and diftrefs, and leave the 
operative manufacturer entirely idle, at a time too, when his 
need may be greateft, and he utterly unable to turn himfelf to 
any other employment. Nor is wool kfs beneficial to the weav- 
er, than fafe and encouraging to the manufacturer. Founded 
in nature, the celebrated old chemift's opinion will always be

confirmed by experience, efpecially in northern climates, that 
wool, an animal .production, is much more congenial and fuit- 
able to the human frame, than any vegetable material whatever, 
for the purpofe of cloathing. For, in fact, it is much warmer 
and more fubftantial, than any of the ufual exotic articles of appa- 
rel; and therefore much better adapted to promote perfpiration, 
and prevent thofe fudden obftructions of it, from which proceed 
mod of the maladies with which mankind are fo much afflicted. 
In fhort, woollen cloth is the only proper wear for this cold cli- 
mate ; efpecially, to thofe who are employed in the labours 
of the field, or are any way expofed to the viciffitudes of the 
weather; at the fame time that it is always at hand, more eafily 
purchafed, and in many refpects far lefs expenfive, than thofe 
manifold variegated fhreds of foppifh finery that are juft now, 
every where, fo much in vogue. 

Hence it would feem not unnatural to fuppofe, that to the 
modern paffion for this light fhmfy, airy drefs, fo prevalent 
among all ranks, fo unfuitable to the conllitutions of all, and 
to the occupations and the funds of moll, .particularly of the 
poorer fort, may be afcribed no fmall fhaTe of the equally com- 
mon prevalence of colds, fevers, rheumatifms, afthmas, confump- 
tions, and perhaps too much of what is the worft difeafe of all, 
the amor fcderatus habencli. This, too, is not a little flimulated by 
the ufual attendant of gaudy attire, a violent predilection for 
expenfive amufements, and the various haunts of levity, diffipa- 
tion, and prodigality. To the rich themfclves, habits of this 
fort are fufficiently pernicious; but to the inferior ranks of life 
they are big with mifchief and ruin. For thefe habits enfeeble 
their powers, engrofs their attention, unfit them for the duties 
of their ftation, impair or extinguifh the influence of thofe princi- 
ples and qualities, that are necelfary to conciliate favour, eftcem, 
and confidence, in any department of bufinefs, and deflroy the 
means of fupplying, not merely the fantafiical wants of their own 
creating, but even thofe that are much more natural, unavoid- 
able, and interefting. 

To apply thefe remarks to the fubjeft, from which we have a 
little digreffed, in proportion as a tafte for finery and profufion 
predominates, among thofe employed in fervice or rural labour, 
it mull operate more than they may be aware, both to their 
own detriment, and that of fociety ; particularly, as it tends to

render them lcfs attentive, obliging, and ufcful ; to deter them 
from marriage, by wafting thole funds, that might be a conlid- 
erable aid in maintaining a family, when they ihould be married ; 
to deprive them of an independent refource, in cafe of any un- 
fortunate accident, or in the time of iickneis, or under the frail- 
ties of old age ; and to put it out of their power to exert and 
gratify fome of the beft principles, and feelings of the human 
heart, by contributing to the relief and fupport of their aged 
parents, in funilar circumftanccs of bodily infirmity, difeafc, and 
diftrefs ; in fhort, as it tends to annihilate all the advantages 
refulting from the railed price of their fcrvice and labour. That 
this is too often realifed, needs rather to be regretted than prov- 
ed; efpecially, in the cafe! of females of the above denomination ; 
in fo much, that the cotton and liik manufacturers, and the ven- 
ders of their goods, are generally ftippofed to be the only gain- 
ers, by the prcfert high advance of wages. No matter, the il- 
lufion goes on ; the woollen manufacture is almoll annihilated ; 
the farmer fuffers, agriculture declines apace, fome have/reduced 
their tillage to one half, others to a third of its former extent, 
and others have given it up altogether. Should this courle 
prevail, the probable confequences, as has been noticed, behove 
to be fatal to the country, which may God prevent. But 
in ordinary cafes miracles are not to be expected. Means mnlr. 
be ufed. Thefe need hardly be fpecilied. They will readily 
occur to thofe whole province it is to devife, and who have it 
in their power to adminifter the relief that is fo much wanted. 
Only, in general, it would certainly be of no fmall fervice to 
the country, were the hint, given about 50 years ago by the 
amiable and elegant Shenstone, properly improved. Strongly 
imprefTed with what he then beheld, and prefageful, as it would 
fcem, of (till worfe to come, by the above abfurd and ruinous 
fyftem ; his gentle but nobly zealous Mufe could not refrain from 
venting her plaintive patriotic forrow, in thefe and the like pa- 
thetic (trains, which may now too well be refumed with redoub- 
led energy :

To what is here fuggefted, with every advantage of poetical 
beauty and patriotic ardour, may be added, that every other aid 
fhould be given towards the revival of the woollen manufac- 
ture in Scotland. With reipect to farmers, every tax or public 
impoft, that bears hard upon them, or the labouring poor, fhould 
be removed or mitigated. Some method too, that may be judg- 
ed confident with equity and humanity, fhould be adopted, to 
fupply the prefent fcarcity of hands, a much more formidable 
evil than all the exorbitance of price for rural labour. In- 
formed of our iituation, tranfmarine ilrangers, many of them 
fufficiently exceptionable, have flocked hither, profeffedly in 
queft of employment, but very little to the advantage of the 
country. Much better, furely, would it have been, to have 
employed the military in making the great roads, which has 
often been done formerly ; and to have allowed them proper 
wages for their work : Or, to have got a competent number of 
our own fober, temperate, hardy, countrymen from the North ; 
by which means the fpirit of emigration, in that quarter, would 
have been much abated ; the bufinefs of great works, and eve- 
ry kind of manufacture carried on, without any detrimental in- 
terference with each other; and much of the inconvenience, at- 
tending the unreftrained influx, and the indifcriminate admif- 
lion of unknown characters, prevented. 

That a meafure, fo obvious and eafy in itfelf, and fo directly 
tending to public utility, fhould have been fo long and fo much 
overlooked, is truly furprifing, and perfectly unaccountable; — I 
had almoft faid, inexcufabje. At laft, indeed, there occurred an 
incident, that ferved to excite the tender and generous fenfibili- 
ties of human nature, into a powerful co-operation with the 
maxims of propriety, expediency, and found policy, in favour 
of that part of the fcheme juft now fuggefted, which relates to 
our fellow citizens, the Highlanders. It was when a confider- 
able body of that very valuable people were crowding to the

between 2 and 3 miles broad, and confifts of feveral feams, 
i'ome of them very deep. One of thefe, at the Cairnburn, is 
the only place in this quarter, that furnifhes that fort of coal 
which is ufed in working iron. It is carried in carts for 
that purpofe, to the diftance of 30 or 40 miles, in different 
directions. In feveral places, the coal is covered with blue free

tified to them, they imagined was not to be found in their own 
country. From whatever caufe, their fituation at this time 
happened to be fuch, as to attract more than ufual attention 
and companion. Among thole who beheld or heard of thii 
moving fcene, an eminent manufacturer, much to his honour, 
exerted and diftinguifhed himfelf. This was Mr David Dale 
of Glafgow, laid to be no lei's remarkable for his public and 
private virtues, than for enterprife and fuccefs in the line of 
his bufinefs, who took thefe poor intending emigrants under 
his care, and employed them in his works. On this occafion, 
too, a Society was inftituted in Glafgow, for Preventing 
Emigration. So linking an inftance of judicious patriotic hu- 
manity, could hardly fail to be the fubject of the warmed enco- 
miums ; but feems to have been too little regarded and im- 
proved, as an example for imitation ; as no material alteration 
for the better has followed, with refpect to the number of ufe- 
ful hands, in moll of the fouthern parts of the kingdom. To

Mineral Waters.— The moft remarkable mineral fprings 
here are, one on the top of the Rig-hill, and another at the 
Rig-burn. The firft is not wide, but very deep, and of the 
fame quality as the Mcrkland Spaw in Galloway ; and has 
been ufed with much advantage for ftomachic complaints. 
The other, called Rig-bum Spaw, is well known. By a che- 
mical analyfis, it has been afcertained to be the fame in quali- 
ty with the Hart-field fpring, near Moffat, but almoft twice 
as ftrong. It has been found very powerful in fcorbutic cafes, 
and very beneficial in fome ftomachic ailments. Certain it is, 
it exhilarates the fpirits, gives an edge to the appetite, and 
promotes digeftion. It is collected into two large ftone cis- 
terns ; the one neareft the fountain is covered with an arched 
roof, and kept locked ; the other is likewife covered with, 
ftrong ftone flags, and open at the under end, where any that 
come may be ferved. This was done about 8 or 9 years ago, 
at the expence of the principal people in this neighbourhood. 
Nothing is charged for the water, which has been fent 
for, from very diftant parts of the country, even from Edin- 
burgh and Glafgow ; but it is ufed with moft advantage on the 
fpot *. 

Population* 

* A Angular proof of this, and of the efficacy of the waters 
as an antifcorbutic, occurred feveral years ago in the cafe of an 
Englifhman, who had been difmiffed from Carlifle infirmary, as 
incurable. He came in the winter time, was very poor, depen- 
ded chiefly on the humanity of the people around, and was but 
indifferently accommodated, confidering what his cafe required. 
For, to fay nothing of other effefls of the fcorbutic habit he la- 
boured under, he was quite emaciated, bowed down, feeble, 
and (difpirited. But after the regular ufe of this water, taken 
from the fpring twice or thrice a day, he gradually recruited, 
till in about 8 weeks time he became quite well, and went away 
flout, lively, and joyous, becaufe of his unexpected and remark- 
able recovery.

Population. — Whether the inhabitants of this parifli were 
formerly (perhaps 90 or 100 years ago) more numerous, than 
at prefent, cannot now be well afcertained * ; though the af. 
firmative may fairly enough be prefumed, from the general 
annexation of 2, 3, or 4, farms into one, and the number of 
ley farms, as they are called, becaufe let to people living at 
a diftance, or not within the parifli. Of thefe there are 9 
or 10 ; four of which are rented by extra parifhioners. Nor 
can it but be doubtful, whether the prefumeable decreafe of 
population, occafioned by thefe means, will be made up by the 
acceffion of the new large village below the church, and 2 
or 3 fmaller ones near the river Craivkk. Be that as it will, 
the prefent amount is near 800 examinable perfons, and the 
number of fouls in the parifli about - - 1000

Language. — That the Gaelic, or Earfe, has in antient 
times been the prevailing language of this part of the coun- 
try, may fairly enough be concluded from the names of dif- 
ferent lands in the parifh; fuch as Crock-ay, Knockenjig, 

Knocfonjlaby 

* Baptifms are inferted in the parifli regifler, but neither 
marriages nor deaths. Nor can even the infertion of baptifms 
be traced farther back than the year 1742. To form a general 
calculation, it may be obferved, that about 20 years ago the 
average number of baptifms, for 3 years, was near 13 each 
year; and that the fame average, for the laft 3 years, was a- 
bout'18. The children of diflenters are not included, as the 
parents decline taking the benefit of the regifler for that pur- 
pofe, either to avoid paying the ufual fmall perquifite to the 
clerk or, as is fuppofed by mod people, becaufe it is a part 
of their political etiquette, to exprefs in this way their dread of 
contagion or contamination, from even a parochial record. 
Whether they keep a regifler of their own, or not, is more than 
can at prefent be afcertained.

Kmckenflab, Cans, tsfc. How long it is ago, fince it ceaf- 
ed to be vernacular, cannot be afcertained; only, the Englifh. 
language is now fpoken here, as in the reft of Nithfdale, with 
confiderable purity, excepting chiefly a few old Scotch, or 
rather obfolete Saxon words, that now and then occur ; and 
in a plain, eafy, manly ftile of pronunciation, without any 
of thofe grating peculiarities of provincial accent, that mark 
the dialedt of iome of the adjoining counties. With the 
fmall exception, of one from England, and another from Ire- 
land, the inhabitants are all natives of Scotland. 

Difenfesy C5V. — Enjoying the advantage of an open fixa- 
tion, particularly a long and wide extended ftrath, which 
forms the principal part of the parifh, added to other circum- 
ftances formerly mentioned, tending to render the air pure 
and falubrious ; the people here are in general ftout and heal- 
thy, and ufually free from epidemical diftempers. Even 
when thofe have been raging in the contiguous parts of the 
neighbouring parifhes, here they have fcarcely or not at all 
appeared; at leaft, if they did, it was moftly in a milder form, 
except in low confined places where the houfes were damp 
and ill aired, and accommodation in other refpects perhaps 
rather unfavourable for the patients. For the lame reafon, 
in part, it is to be feared, that the great increafe of the 
village, below the church, will be attended with a very ma- 
terial change, as to falubrity, in that quarter of the parifh ; 
as the fite of it is low, flat, miry, and partly fubjecl to a 
land flood after heavy rains, efpecially in the months of au- 
tumn and winter. The difeafes moft common in this parifh, 
are, the rheumatifm, afthma, and confumption, in adults ; 
and the teething fever, the croup, chincough, and fmall-pox, 
in children. Of thefe in children the firft three, perhaps 
*po the laft, are greatly mitigated, or prevented, by the ear-

ly and confhnt ufe of the Burgundy pitch plafter, applied be* 
tween the blades of the moulders ; and the danger of the 
laft is effeftually obviated by inoculation, to which the moft 
lcrupulous and prejudiced ;ire now almoft univerfally recon- 
ciled. Only, in fome cafes, its defign has been defeated, 
and its credit much injured, either by injudicious pra&amp;ice, 
■when the patient has been afflicted with fome other acute 
diforder; or by the difcontinuance of proper attention and 
medicines, when the difeafe has been fuppofed at an end, but 
its malignant remains of reforbed virulent matter, ftill latent 
in the blood, have again broke out in fome other form, more 
hoflile to the conftitution, and fatal in the iflue. — As to 
Other particulars, the generality of the people here are in 
ftature from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet, or more ; and live to 
the age of between 60 and 90 years, and fome of them longer. 

Employments. — From the account already given, it will eafi- 
ly be underftood, that the people of this parifh are moftly far- 
mers; confequently they are generally employed in agriculture 
and the breeding and management of fheep and black cattle. 
Hence their fervants and horfes are chiefly intended fur, and 
conftantly occupied in, work relating to thefe various particu- 
lars. So that houfehold fervants and faddle horfes muft in 
this cafe be much out of the queftion ; efpecially as the u- 
nited property of the refiding heritors (5 or 6 in number) 
would perhaps be too high rated at 130 1. per annum, and 
there are only 4 or 5 tenants, each of whom pays above 70 1. 
of yearly rent. Here the rule of judgment, one would think, 
is fhort and fimple ; and yet the report, given in by the tax 
furveyor, has for feveral years paft been very erroneous, if we 
are to judge by its confequences. When a little capricious def- 
pot of this kind has fixed the ftamp of exaction, upon thofe 
yanks of fociety whom the law exempts, he may, if he pleaf-

felf upon his own vaft official importance; but he muft be 
pronounced an unfeeling plunderer, and a real enemy to the 
king, to the conftitution, to the country, and to mankind. 
Nor can it but be regretted, that the prefent eftablifhed mode 
of obtaining redreis or relief, in fuch cafes, is too troublefome 
and expenfive ; efpecially to country people living at a great 
diftance from thofe courts of juffice, to which appeals and com- 
plaints on points of this fort are competent. Betides fervants 
hired for the year or half year, there are other hands employ- 
ed in the work of hay and harvetl, either by the day or by 
the piece, i. e. till the particular work of each of thefe fea- 
fons is concluded. About 20 years ago, the wages of men fer- 
vants were from 2 1. 10 s. to 3 1. 10 s. per annum \ and of 
women, from 1 1. 10 s. to 2 1. But at prefent the former are

Leaving this to thofe o f the two laft denominations, at pre- 
fent, and to others, to be as ludicrous, or even fevere, as they 
pleafe, with illiterate pretenders to medical fcience ; ftill, lay- 
ing afide wantoi , unfair ridicule, one may be allowed to fay, 
that the want of a- thorough bred Ikilful practitioner in me- 
dicine is certainly a very material difadvantage to any part of 
the country. For this reafon, it is much to be wifhed, that 
there were a fixed falary for one properly qualified, in every 
diftrict, of an extent proportioned to its iituation, as falu- 
brious or the contrary, to the number of its inhabitants, 
and the nature of their employments ; at leaft, in thofe parts 
which lie at any confiderable diftance from towns or large 
villages. 

ManufaBures. — On the verge of the parifh, near Sanqu- 
har, there is an iron* plating forge, erected a good many years 
ago. Its great hammer, (head and haft,) weighs 6 cwt. 
and ftrikes 170 times, or more, in a minute, by means of a 
wheel 14 feet in diameter, that goes by water. This work 
belongs to a refpectable fubftantial Company, and the bufi- 
nefs of it is carried on to a pretty confiderable extent. Nor 
indeed can this, or any other manufafture, eafily fail of fuc- 
cefs, in a fituation fo very favourable, as far as plenty of wa-

tcr, coal, peat, and comparative cheapnefs of provisions, are 
concerned. Added to thcfe advantages, abundance of wool 
on the fpot and over the whole neighbourhood, muft render 
a woollen manufacture in this place a mo ft eligible fcherne 
of bulinefs ; yet, till within thelc f nv years, the people here 
feem not to have Sufficiently underftood, or attended 10 the 
importance of thole local circumftances, which were capable 
of being fo much improved, to the advancement of their own 
intereft. During the time excepted, both carpets and plain 
woollen cloth have been manufactured by different hands, in 
the principal village and its vicinity. Much more might, 
and no doubt would, have been done, had any aid been 
granted from the public funds, faid to be intended for the 
encouragement of fuch undertakings. At prelent, notwith- 
standing, the carpet branch appears to be a little upon the 
increafe. But the greateft number of hands have, for fomc 
time paft, been employed in weaving muflin for the cotton 
manufacturers in Ayrfhire. — It is in agitation to eftablifh an 
woollen manufacture on a pretty large fcale ; aided by a full 
fet of carding and fpinning machinery, to be erected for that 
purpofe *. 

Farmer Society. — ImprefTed with the increasing difcour- 
agements attending agriculture, and the want of fyftem in 
the management of rural bufinefs; to obviate or remedy thefe 
difadvantages, as far as might be in their power, the lead- 
ing people of the parifh did, about three years ago, consti- 
tute therafelves into a Farmer Society. Among the nrlt things

they did, was to eftablifh a market, to be always held at 
Kirkconnel village, twice in the year, viz. on the i ft Tues- 
day of Mav, and on the ift Tuefday of November, for the 
hiring of fcrvants, and the fale of cattle, and of woollen yarn 
and cloth. Aware that, in every promifcuous concourfe of 
this kind, there may be fome people too much difpofed to 
create difturbance, efpecially when, in a place like this, 
there is no magiftracy near at hand to keep them in awe ; 
the Society have taken proper meafures for preferving peace 
and good order during the time of the market. To prevent 
inifiakes in buying and felling, and to facilitate the progrefs of 
bufinefs in this way, the Witichefter bufhel is fixed upon as 
the ftandard meafure for grain, and the rate of markets is to 
be duly notified to the clerk, from time to time, in order to 
be communicated. Such too as want either to buy or fell

Heritors and Rent. —Except what was before fuppofed to 
be worth about 130I. per annum, the whole parifh belongs 
to the Duke of Queensberr y. The excepted part is di- 
vided among 5 or 6 heritors, who ufually refide in the pa- 
rift. One of thefe portions is fo fmall as not to exceed a 

finale acre in extent *. 

The Duke's property is occupied, at leaft rented, by 23 te- 
nants, who pay from 160 1. down to 30 1. each, of yearly

* For this there is a charter, (evidently a whimfical thing 
at firft), as far back as the year 1444, the reddendum of which, 
* unus folidus monetae regni Scotiae\ is to be paid ' minijlro minif- 
tranti ad altare beatae virginis', and afterwards, by the precept 
of dare confiat, from Lord William Crichton of Sanquhar, 
to the minifter of the parilh and his fuccefibrs in office. 

+ Anterior to the year 1732, Mr John Carmichael was 
the latl Prefbyterian minifter of this parifh, who was turned out of 
his charge in 1662, when Epifcopacy was violently obtruded 
upon this kingdom. In the year 1681, Mr Samuel Moat, the 
Epifcopal incumbent, was likewife obliged to leave his charge j 
becauie he could not take the oath required by the teft aft. 
From that period, the vacancy was protracled, to the year 1732; 
when Mr Peter Rae, then minifter of Kirkbride, was admit- 
ted minifter of Kirkconnel Like the old celebrated Joannes de 
Sacro Bo/co, or John of Holywood, in his day, fuppofed, by 
his name, to have been alfo of this country, Mr Rae was an 
eminent philofopher and aftronomer, as well as a divine ; buc 
much more learned and enlightened than the other. His af-

conftructed in all its parts with his own hand, is a continued 
linking proof both of his mechanical powers, and of the extent

is patron. The church, manfe, and offices, have been re- 
paired, but not rebuilt fince the year 17295 and, except the 
want of fome fmall repairs, are in pretty good condition. By 
a decreet in 1655, the ft.pend was modified to 43 I. 18s. iod. 
with 3 chalders of virtual, 2 of corn, and 1 of bear ; by a 
new decreet in 1763, it was augmented to6pl. 8 s. 10 » d. 
and no virtual; and, by a late decreet, it is now 71 I. i 3 s? 4 d. 
with 4 chalders of virtual, one half bear, and the other half 
oat-meal. The only diflenters here are Pfefbyterians, under 
the different denominations of Carneronians, Burghers, and 
Antiburghers. Of the firft clafs, there are 3 or 4 • of the 
fecond, 1 or 2 ; and of the laft, between 20 and 30 ; whofe 
meeting-houfe is at Sanquhar, within a mile of the march 
between the two parilhes. Thefe feparate themfelves from 
the eftablifliment, and from one another, on account of mat- 
ters merely political, or fuch miftakes and inconveniencies at- 
tending judicial proceedings, as may be experted, f 0 long as 
men are not infallible, or connerted here below with the 
church militant ; but which are no part of our religion, be- 
caufe no part of this church's terms of communion. Of 
courfe, divifion mult, in this cafe, one would think, be ra- 
ther unneceffary, unreasonable, and unwarrantable from fcrip- 
ture. More aware of this, and more imprefled with it, than 
formerly, as would feem, (now that the dult and heat of con- 
troverfv have much fubfided and abated,) the generality of 
people are more inclined to judge and fpeak of thefe points

April 1770, the prefent incumbent, Mr John Robertson, was

Implicit credit, to thofe who would prefs every thing into the 
fervice of their own views and defigns ; lefs ready to be mif- 
led by confident pretences, or falfe exaggerated reprefenta- 
tions ; and lefs difpofed to relilh thofe efFufions of fpleen and 
rancour, which formerly polluted the field of religious debate, 
and are always the fure proof of a weak argument, the for- 
lorn refuge of a bad caule, and the difgrace of a good one; 
in fhort, no longer the dupes of that captious felfifh fpirit of 
contention, which takes every thing by the wrong handle, 
views every objecl: in the worft light, and difturbs the peace 
of fociety ; the good people here lofe all fight of little party 
diftincfions, make proper allowances for each others peculia- 
rities of fentiment on all hands, and live together in that ftile 
of eafy, harmonious, and friendly intercourfe, which is fo 
amiable in itfelf, ufeful and comfortable in focial hfe, and 
ornamental to the faith which they in common avow. 

School. — The fchool is taught by an old man, who has had 
it thefe 30 years under his care. His falary is only 100 
merks, with a gratuity of 1 1. Sterling, from the Duke of 
Queenfberry, and 10 s. for which he is to teach a poor or- 
phan or two, when any happen to be in the parifh, in con- 
fequence of a mortification to that effect by the late minifter, 
Mr Hunter. 

Poor — There have for many years paft been above 20 per- 
fons on the poors roll, including difTenters as well as others ; 
but of late their number is a little reduced. The only paro- 
chial provifion for them confifts of the weekly colle&amp;ions, 
and 61. 6 s. 8 d. yearly from the Duke of Queenfberry; 
with now and then a fmall legacy from fome of the fubftan- 
tial parifliioners, and the intereft of what has from time to

time been faved from thefe chanties. Relative to the quef- 
tion, whether the poor here receive any fupply from the pub- 
lic collcclions made by difl'enters, extended even to the cafe 
of thofe of their own community, for any thing u^derftood 
by this kirk feffion, much cannot be affirmed j but, confined 
to thofe of the eftablifhment, all that can be faid is, if they do 
receive any thing from fuch collections, in this parifh, it is 
either fo fecretly as not to be known, or fo leldom as not 
to deferve any particular notice. 

Roads. — Befides the old great road, from Sanquhar to 
Cumnock, a parr of that long track of road, made lolely at 
the expenceof the late amiable, revered, and munificent Duke 
of Queensberrt ; there is a fide road from it to the Earl 
of Dumfries':, lime quarry, and one up the holm of Crawick 
river, towards Crawfcrdjohn. Juft now, too, the great turn- 
pike road, on the line between Carlifle and Glafgow, is near- 
ly completed. It runs along the face of the hills on the 
north fide of this parifh, and through the wildeft and high- 
eft part of it. This circumftance will, it is thought, render 
travelling precarious and difficult, fometimes impracticable, 
in the winter feafon, when, after a deep fall of fnow, it is 
often found nearly impoffible to remove the fheep in that 
quarter to lower ground for relief. On the old great road, 
there is a toll-bar lately erected. Of this the near neighbours 
complain much, becaufe it is a heavy cefs upon rhe.n, though 
a fmall impoft to ftrangers or occafional travellers ; not to 
add, that they pay a large yearly afieffment for the ftatute 
labour. 

Rivers and Bridges. — The parifh. abounds in rivers, brooks, 
and fprings. Befides the river Nit/?, which runs through the 
middle of it, from weft to nearly fouth-caft, and the fmaller 

rivers 



of Kirkcor.nel. 457 

rivers Crawick and KiI/oxv on the march with Sanquhar; 
it contains fcveral burns, or brooks, that run into thefe, and 
a good many more which crofs the high road, or come down 
from the hills on the other fide into the Nith. This laft has a 
good ftone bridge over ir, a fhort way above the church; a 
little below which, there is another over the rivulet called 
Polburn. The only other ftone bridge worth notice, is one 
over the Crawick, at the march between this parifh and San- 
quhar, raid to have been built anno 170(1, by James Duke 

v, 

of Queenfberry. 

Antiquities and Curioftties. — Of thefe, very little or nothing 
occurs, that merits attention, except a few font-ftones, and 
a grave-ftone, laid to be on the top of Glenwhurry-hill. It 
is overgrown with grafs, and funk a foot or more below the 
furface, near a little cairn, or heap of fmall ftones ; and, as the 
tradition adds, has this infcription upon it, « Here lies St. 
Connel, who built Kirkbride and Kirkconnel'. There are 
ftill many cairns in the parifh, with veftiges and traditions of 
many more formerly. Some of them contain a great quanti- 
ty of human bones, that are often and eafily difcovered. 
Among feverai romantic fpots that might be mentioned^ there 
is one that claims particular notice. It is a natural cafcade, 
in the river Crawick, about half a mile above the bridge, 
where the water tumbles and daflies from rock to rock with 
tremenduous noife, cfpecially when the river is any way 
fwelled ; then rifes in boiiing eddies and foaming forges; and 
at laft rolls on in a bold majeftic torrent, amidft as fine a piece 
of grotto fcenery as can well be imagined. 

Character.— As to the character and morals of the people ; 
they are acute, deliberate, cool, fteady, ferious, and well ac- 
quainted with the principles of Chriftianitjc With them it is

no new thing to combine, with thefe principles and the offices 
of religion, the difpofitions of dutiful lubjecls, the habits of 
good citizens, and the virtues of private life. To a good de- 
gree of induftry they add contentment, cuearfulnefs, candour, 
good nature, and a quiet peaceable behaviour. Though fixan- 
gers to finical refinement, or even to much of urbanic polifh, 
they are open, honeft, and obliging ; kind, friendly, humane, 
and holpitablc. In their fttie of living, they are decent, fo- 
ber, and temperate •, and, in adverfity or diftrefs, fedate, pa- 
tient, and refigned. Not but that, here, as in other places, 
there are too many exceptions, in whole or in part ; only, it 
may be affirmed, that thefe are, perhaps, as few as in any 
other parifh of the fame number of inhabitants and villager. 
As fo much general evidence of this, a few hSts may be men- 
tioned. 

What fir ft occurs, and claims no fmall degree of commen- 
dation, is, that in thefe giddy, gloomy, turbulent times, this 
people have hitherto remained untainted by the contagion of 
that mod empty but fallacious and peftilential thing, which, 
under various forms and names, particularly, the fpecious 
name of philcfophy y has long infefied the church, and now 
threatens confufion, anarchy, and defolation to the ftate and 
,to the country. To guard them againit its poifon and deceit, 
though conveyed with the utmoft art and induftry, no parti- 
cular exertions were needful ;. fatisfied on the beft grounds-, 
that their religion is divine;, — that its peculiar, as well as ge- 
neral principles, perfectly accord, with the dictates o£ right

reipect to the laws of heaven ; — that thefe laws clearly exhi- 
bit all the regards we owe, all the obligations we are under, 
jo one another, as fuperiors, inferiors, and equals ; particu- 
larly to kings, and others in authority; — that the conftitur 
tion we now enjoy, is the beft human fecurity for the con-

firmed prefervation of both our civil and religious rights and 
liberties ; — -that, as our religion and government thus mutu- 
ally fupport each other, whatever would unhinge the one, 
muft unhinge and endanger the other, or rather, both to- 
gether ; — and that apparent or temporary imperfections and 
inconveniencies cannot excufe or extenuate the guilt of what 
in this cafe would be doubly criminal ; any thing like rebellion 
or /edition. — Satisfied of all this, the people here require very 
little argument to imprefs th'em with juft contempt and detef- 
tation of that heku tight, ablurdly enough fo called, which is 
nothing elfe but the ignis fat uus of old exploded error, brought 
up from its dark caverns, and fet off with fome new -airs of 
fli hr of hand parade ; or of that philofophy, whofe freedom of 
thought , liberality of fentiment, and right of private judgment, 
are chiefly employed in oppoling or depreciating the truth, 
the wifdom, and the laws of heaven, and in reviling and 
fpeaking evil of dignities and rulers on earth -, that philofophy, 
which materializes men into brutes, nay, monfters, raging for 
rapine, blood, and murder. 

Another thing deferving notice, as iiluflrative of this peo- 
ple's chara&amp;er, is, that their charities, both in public and 
private, have hitherto been fo liberal, as to iuperfede the ne- 
cessity of having recourle ro any affeflment lor the mainten- 
ance of the poor *. With the lame view to this, theie needs 
only to be added, what implies much in favour of their gene- 
ral character, that, within the memory of man, none of 
them has ever fuffered a capital punifhment, or received any 
public ftigma from the hands of jufiice. Uniting this, with 
the nrfl mentioned of theie leading fails, we are naturally 

led 

* Nay, though during more than 20 years pafl, the annual

led to make an obfervation, which cannot well be omitted ; 
namely, that the prefent increafe of ignorance, as to the 
principles of Chriftianity, fo remarkable in moft of our towns, 
is evidently owing to the difcontinuance or neglect of cate- 
chetical induction, and defertion of divine inftitutions, fol- 
lowed by the prevalence of gambling and dram-drinking-, in 
connexion with another train of inaufpicious circumfiances 
ftated under a preceeding article •, — to all this mud be afcritx- 
ed much of fhe preient licentioulnefs, both in morals and po- 
litics, and the melancholy difference in the annals of justici- 
ary in Scotland, fo uncommon of late, beyond any former 
era. For nothing is more certain, than that, if in aid of the, 
worft paffions of the human heart, men are allowed to run 
wild and wafte, blind and fecure, in ignorance of thofe di- 
vine principles which alone can awe their conferences, and 
foim their minds and lives to genuine goodnefs, and at the 
fame time are eafily and cheaply furnifhedwith that fort of li- 
quor, luch as aquavitae, or rather aqua mortis, and that too, ge- 
nerally, of the moft poifonous quality, which intoxicates them 
into rage and madnefs; they are then prepared for the perpe- 
tration of any crimes, be they ever fo nefarious, barbftfous, 
or atrocious.

By the Reverend ^ Roderick Macrae, Miffimary Mi- 
mfer in the parifh cf Applecrofs.</head>



<p>Origin of the Nams. 

LO£HBROOM takes its name from a river, -which runs 
through a confiderable tract of this parifh, called Meikls 
Strath, and an arm of the fea, into which this river falls. In 
Gaelic the river is called Braon, and the country around it 
Lochbbraon. But as this would not. found fo well in Euglifh, 
it was thought proper to change it into Lochbroom. 

Situation and Extent.— -The weflern boundary of this parifh 
is wafhed by that part of the Atlantic Ocean, which divides 
the ifland of Lewis from the main land of Scotland. The 
exact length and breadth of it cannot be eafily ascertained, as 
it is of a very irregular figure, being uneven in its marches 
with the neighbouring parifhes, and indented in many places 
by feveral fmall arms of the fea. Some have computed it at 
36 miles long, and 20 broad, 

Surface, Rivers, Lakes, and Fifi, CJ3V.— Th,e far greater 
part of this parifh confiQs'of wild uncultivated mountains and 
hills, abounding with rocks, mofs, and heather. But thefe

tracts are not altogether ufclefs, as they ferve for pafluve to 
a great number of black cattle. There is, however, a great 
deal of fine arable lands in which they ufually raife pretty 
rich crops. Thefe fertile fpots are for the moft part clofe 
by the fea fide ; from which they extend, in fome places, in 
the form of long valleys, to the diftance of two computed 
miles and upwards, fuch as the Meikle and little Straths , Strath- 
Cainard, C5Y. Befides thefe places, which ufually produce rich 
crops both of corn and grafs, there are a few good glens, 
wholly detached from the fea, which are alfo pretty fertile. 
In thefe ftraths and glens, and different other parts of the 
parifh, there are woods of various kinds; particularly, fir, 
birch, afh, and aller. There are alfo fome rivers and frefli- 
water lakes, which furnifh fome trouts and falmon. And, 
upon the whole, the furface of this parifh yields an agreeable 
variety of hill and dale, wood and water, corn and grafs. 

Soil, Produce, and Cultivation. — The foil, though fertile, is 
not in general deep, but rather light and jingly. The crops cou- 
fift of barley, oats, and peafe, together with a great quantity 
of potatoes They feldom begin to fow till towards the lat- 
ter end of April, and fometimes the barley is not wholly 
laid down till the middle of June. The harveft, however, 
is commonly pretty early ; and, excepting fome bad years, the 
crop is ufually all gathered in by the middle of October. 
The chief implements of hufbandry are the plough and the 
crooked fpaclej they fometimes, however, ufe common fpades 
and pick-axes. The manure moft ufed is fea-ware, which is 
got in confiderable quantities on the adjacent fhores. They 
alfo make a few compound dunghills ; and fome of the more 
fubftantial of the farmers ufe a fmall quantity of fhelly fand, 
of which there is a large bank towards the northern extremi- 
ty of the parifh. From this place it is carried in veffels 

and

and open boats, according to the conveniency and circum- 
ftances of the ufers of it. They fometimes bring it, aftesr 
landing, in creels or bafkets on horfeback, from the diftance 
of two or three miles; and, notwithstanding this trouble, they 
often find that it abundantly repays their labour; for it pro- 
duces exuberant crops out of lands that were formerly thought 
good for nothing. The virtue of it, however, does not con- 
tinue above five or fix years ; and at the expiration of fuch a 
period, from the time of laying it on the ground, they are ob- 
liged to leave the lands ley for a certain nua.ber of years; 
commonly three or four. During this interval, the ley lands 
yield very good grafs. 

Climate and Difea/es. — The air of this, as weli as that of the 
neighbouring parifhes, is lomewhat damp and moift; which is 
chiefly imputable to their near vicinity to the Atlantic Ocean, 
The rains are much more frequent and heavy in thefe corners, 
than in the lower and interior parts of this kingdom ; and 
often prove a prodigious obftruclion to the farmers, in the la- 
bouring and harveft fealons. They always come on with the 
wefterly winds ; and when it blows in a contrary direction, 
the weather is ufually fair Notwithftanding its wetnefs, the 
dimate is not unhealthy, and many of the inhabitants live 
to a good old age; few of them, however, complete 100 
years. The people are not fubjeel to any epidemical diftem- 
pers; but, in fpring 1791, they were vifited by a moft ma- 
lignant fever, which IweDt away great numbers of them. 

Population.— The population of this parifh has increafed 
greatly within theie 40 years. The prefent number of fouls 
is about - 3S0£)

4^4 Statijlical Account 

Heritors and Refit — The land rents are about 1700I. Ster- 
ling. There are five proprietors, viz. Mr Mackenzie of Cro- 
marty, Mr Mackenzie of Dundonnel, Mr Davidfon of TuU 
loch, Sir Alexander Mackenzie of Coul, and Mr Mackenzie 
of Achitly. Mr Mackenzie of Dundonnel is the only pro- 
prietor who refides in the parifh. 

Prices of Provi/ions, and Wages. — Every article almoft has 
of late rifen in price. Oat meal, upon an average, fells at 
17s. per boll; barley meal at 14s. barley at 18s. oats at 
16 s. Beef is 2d. per lib. mutton the fame ; hens 4 d. and 
fometimes 6 d. each ; eggs 2 d. per dozen ; butter 12 s. per 
ftone; cheefe 4s. falmon u|d. per lib. frefh ; herring 
7 s. per barrel, including all expences previous to packing. 
A good ploughman gets 4 1. Sterling in a year, together with 
his maintainance ; a woman fervant 20 s. a herd 20 s. and a 
day-labourer od. per day without victuals. 

Villages and Fifieries. — The Britifh Society have fixed one 
of their villages here, at a place called Ullapool. The Socie- 
ty began to build fome houfes in this place, in fummer : 788 ; 
and private perfons have been ever fince adding to the num. 
ber annually, fo that in this village there are now about 72 
houfes, of which 35 are llated ; the reft are thatched with 
turf, fern roots, and heather. The principal inducement 
to fettle in this village is its advantageous fituation for the 
herring filhing, which indeed is very great ; being placed on 
a lake, that has long been remarkable for the finelt herring ; 
and holding a centrical fituation with refpeft to the beft fifh- 
ing lakes on the weft coaft, both fouth and north of it. The 
herring commonly fet in for Lochbroom, and fome neighbour- 
ing lakes, in the month of July; and often continue till fpring. 
They fometimes, however, do not remain long at a time ;

but great fhoals of them come at different periods of the fame 
feafon, and go away again in a few days thereafter. They 
are always caught in the night-time ; and the darker the 
night is, the better for the fiihers, provided it be free of rain. 
In this village there is a red herring home, where they cured 
laft year 500 barrels fine red-herring. There are other two 
filhing houfes of an older Handing, in the neighbourhood of 
Ullapool ; one at Ifle Martin, about 4 or 5 miles north of Ul- 
lapool. This houfe was erefted, about 20 years ago, by a 
company of Liverpool gentlemen, who keep an overfeer 
there during the fifhrng fealbn, every year ; and they have 
often reaped confiderable profits from this trad«. The other 
houfe of this kind is at JJle Tatiera, a little diftant to the 
north of Ifle Martin ; which was erected, in the year 17&amp;5, 
bv a London company and a Mr Roderick Morifon from 
Stornoway, a man of extenfive mercantile talents, who was 
undertaker for the building, and afterwards became manager 
for the company. During his fuperintendency, the riihing 
proved a lucrative branch of bulinefs for the company ; but 
he died in fummer 1 79 z ; and foon after the company was 
difTolved, and the houfe and appendages fold to a Mr Muc- 
donald from the Ifle of Sky. This gentleman has not had 
time to make much of the fifhing as yet ; but, in fo favour- 
able a fituation for that buhnefb, it is cot to be doubted, but 
he will foon experience the fame good fuccefs with his pre- 
decefTcrs. The herring cured in this country are fent to'dif- 
ferent markets, moft frequently to Leith and Greenock, 
where they fetch high prices. Some are likewife exported 
to Ireland, where they ufually fell to great advantage. There 
is a falmon filhing, clofe to the village, on the river of Ulla- 
pool. There are alfo other two falmon fi filings in the pariah ; 
one at Inverlae], and the other at Meikle Gruinard. But

the quantity of fifh, cured at all thefe three places taken to- 
gether, is ufually little more than the two laft. 

Roads and Bridges. — There was an excellent road betwixt 
Ullapool and the town of Dingwall, commenced in fummer 
1792, and it is now nearly finifhed ; fo that, where lately 
nothing could be carried but in creels on horfeback, carts 
and carriages can now travel with the greateft eafe and expe- 
dition. This road confifts of 38 miles, and has coaft govern- 
ment about 4500 1. including bridges, of which there muft 
be a good many in its courfe. We are informed that fimilar 
roads are foon to be made to different other parts of the 
Highlands ; which are indeed highly neceffary. Perhaps a 
I few crofs roads would be alfo proper ; particularly one from 
Ullapool to Pollew, which lies about 30 miles fouth-weft of 
it. And if this road was farther extended from Pollew to 
Lochcarron, by the fhorteft cut that could be contrived, it 
would be of vaft fervice to the Weft Highlands in gene- 
ral, as an eafy communication would, by that means, be 
opened from one parifh to another; and the good efFedts of 
fuch. a road would not only be felt all the way from Loch- 
broom to Glenelg, but would alfo extend further, to oky and 
the Long ljland. Another croft road from Ullapool to Affint, 
on the north, would be likewife very ufeful. 

ManufaSureSt Minerals, Fuel, &amp;c — No manufactures 
have taken place here as yet, except a fpinning one, which 
is carried on upon a very fmall fcale, by two of the fettlers 
at Ullapool, merely for the purpofe of furnilhing employ- 
ment to a few idle hands. A manufacture on a large fcale, 
that could employ a great number of people, is vehemently 
defired. $ome think that a lbap manufacture would be much 
to the purpofe ; but the general voice is in favour of a wool- 
len 



of Lochbroom.

len one. In either cafe, however, they look up to the Bri- 
tifh Society for affiftance, as private adventurers will under* 
take nothing of that kind, that is likely to be productive of 
any extenlive effects. It were therefore earnestly to be wifli- 
ed that the fociety and fuch other patriotic gentlemen, as 
have an influence in the direction of public meafures, would 
take this matter under confideration ; and promote the eftab- 
lifhment of fome ufeful manufacture for the advancement of 
the infant village, which will otherwife be in danger of 
dwindling into nothing again. Though the fifhing be as yet 
the principal, it would not long be the only, inducement to fet- 
tle at Ullapool, if effectual meafures were taken to encourage 
fettlers. This place is poffeffed of many of thofe natural ad- 
vantages, which are requifite to the formation of a guod ma- 
nufacturing town. Here is an excellent harbour, where a 
great number of veffels can lie fafe at anchor, as well as load 
and unload. There was a good quay built in it of late, and 
the entrance to it is fafe and eaiy. Here are alio fevcral hun- 
dred acres of very good foil, which are parcelled out in lots 
or feus by the fociety, for gardens and otUer ufeful purpofes 
to the fettlers. Some of it is inclofed and fubdivided in this 
way already, to very great purpole. A few of the fettlers 
have made fome very fine gardens, where they rear pot-herbs 
and various ufeful roots. Adjoining to this is a large track 
of pafture ground, which will fupport a number of cattle for 
them. Here is alio abundance of ftones for building, and 
lime-ftone too at a little difhnce ; befides the advantage of 
plenty of fuel from a number of good peat moffes, which are 
contiguous to every farm, and almoft inexhauftible ; and a 
river, which might be of great fervice in moving machinery. 
To all thefe advantages we may add, that, if agriculture were 
encouraged, and habits of induftry diffufed among the peo-

pie by men of Ikill and influence, many parts of Lochbroom 
could be made a good corn country. 

Harbours, Shipping, &amp;c. — Befides the harbour at the vil- 
lage, already mentioned, there are fo many othi.r harbours 
in Lochbroom, that it would be tedious to enumerate them. 
Thefe are chiefly to be found on both fides of the Meikle and 
Little Lochs, and along the coaft of Coigach. Th j re are 6 
veffels belonging to Ullapool ; which, together with 4 or 5 
more belonging to the fifhing flations at Tanera and Ifle 
Martin, employ about 40 fearoen. There are no fixed fer- 
ries here, but one is much needed betwixt Ullapool and the 
oppofite fide of the lake. 

Mineral Springs. — There is a mineral fpring at Leckmelm, 
about 2 miles eafl: of Ullapool, which is thought to be of a 
very falubrious quality. Perhaps it may hereafter be found 
to contain powerful virtues, though no pains have as yet been 
taken to afcertain them. Some medical gentlemen, who 
happened to pals that way, were of opinion that it would be 
krviceable in confumptive cafes. There is another mineral 
fpring upon the glebe, but little or no notice has been ta- 
ken of it. 

Church, fefa — There is a pretty good church here, which 
was built feveral years ago. It was lately repaired and ele- 
gantly feated at the expence of the heritors. The money 
ftipend is 91 1. Sterling, and the glebe is worth about 30 1. 
a year. There is befides a large track of ground mortified 
ior the benefit of the church, worth 20 !. a year. So that 
this living in all is worth 141 1. Sterling a year. The pre- 
fent incumbent is Mr Alexander Stronach. Mr Mackenzie 
of Cromarty is patron. There are no funds for the poor, 

but

but what arife from the weekly collections, which in this 
parilh are very trifling, in fome years fcarce amounting to 
4 1. at the parifh church. And when to this are added a 
few fmall collections taken up in other parts of the parifh, 
the fum will ft ill be very low. 

Schools The parochial fchoolmafter has a falary of 1 2 1. a 

year. He is a man of very good abilities, and has been pre- 
ceded by a feries of men, who were fufficiently qualified for 
their bufinefs. But ftill it is to be regretted, that the fchool 
is of no great benefit to the inhabitants. This is partly 
to be afcribed to a ftupid indifference in the generality of 
the people, with regard to every branch of literature, and 
partly to the want of due encouragement from thofe who 
fhould be ready to promote the improvement of the people 
in this way. It is a general and well founded complaint, that 
fchoolmafters meet with too little encouragement in mo ft 
places. It is certainly a grievance which merits redrefs, that 
men of liberal education, fo laborioufly and ufefully employed 
in the fervice of the public, fhould labour for fo fmall a pit- 
tance as the generality of fchoolmafters falaries are. There 
are two Society fchools in this parifh, one at Ullapool, and 
the other at Little Strath. That at Ullapool has a falary of 
25 1 a year, and is ufually attended by a good number of 
fcholars, commonly 40 and upwards. The teacher, Robert 
Monro, has been formerly ordained preacher every Sunday, 
befides teaching through the week. The fchool at Little Strath 
has a falary of 12I. a year, and is alfo pretty well attended. 

Charaaer and Manner of Living.— The people are in gene- 
ral honeft, fober, and well difpofed. At their burials and 
marriages, however, they too much adhere to the folly of 
their anceftors. On thefe occafions they have a cuftom of 
feafting a great number of their friends and neighbours, and 

this

this often at an cxpence, which proves greatly to the pre. 
judice of poor orphans and young people ; although thefe 
feafts are feldom productive of any quarrels or irregulari- 
ties among them. With regard to their food, nth and 
potatoes conllitute the principal part. For moll years the 
produce of the foil does not afford them a fufficicnt (up- 
ply of meal, and they ufually buy a confiderable quantity, 
and that often at a very high rate, from veffcls which are 
fent by meal-mongers to the country. 

Advantages and Difadvantages % C5V It is a very great ad- 
vantage to the people here to be fo near the fea. The her- 
ring fifhing not only contributes much to their fupport, but 
alfo helps them to pay their rents. Still, however, they are 
in general rather poor, and think the land-rents too high. 
The oppreffion of the landholders is a general complaint in 
the Highlands ; and the confequence is, that great numbers 
of the people are forced to emigrate to America, while others 
go to fervice in the low countries and manufacturing towns. 
And thus the population of thefe corners is not near fo great 
as might be expected in fuch an extent of territory. An- 
other circurnftance, which is unfriendly to population, is the 
engrofling of farms for fheep walks. This mode of farming 
has been introduced lately into fome parts of this parifli, and 
proved the occafion of reducing to hardfhips feveral honeft 
families, who lived tolerably happy on the fruits of their in- 
duftry and frugality. Whoever would wilh to fee the popu- 
lation of this country flourifhing, fhould do all in their power 
to put a flop to the fheep traffic, and to introduce manufac- 
tures among the people. Whole diftricts have been already 
depopulated by the introduction of flieep ; fo that, where 
formerly hundreds of people could be feen, no human faces are 

now to be met with, except a fhepherd attended by his dog. 

It 



of Loch broom. 



It has been faid, however, that thefe people who are difpof. 
fefl'ed of their farms, can live much more comfortably in the 
manufacturing employment, than ever they could do before. 
But would they not be ftill more happy, if manufactures were 
introduced among themfelves * ? And is it not a matter of 
importance to the nation to encourage population. in the High- 
lands, as well as in other parts of the kingdom ? Befides 
thefe inconveniencies, many of the people of Lochbroom are 
at a lofs for the means of religious inftruction, though they 
have got a clergyman to the village, and are befides furnifh- 
ed with three catechifts from the committee for the royal 
bounty. In luch an extenfive parifh, there ought to be no 
fewer than 4 clergyman, in order to afford the benefit of 
Chriftian worfhip and public inftrucYton to the whole body of 
the people. In their prelent ftate many of them do not hear 
fo much as one fermon in a year, which is alfo the cafe with 
different parts of fome neighbouring parifhes. In Lochbroom 
it is a ftriking circumftance to fee crowds of people coming 
for christenings and marriages from a diftance of feveral miles, 
both by fea and land, in the time of boifierous and rainy 
weather f . 

Propofed Improvement. — If this parifh were divided into 4 
diftricls, each of them would form a fufficiently extenfive 

and 

* There was a Lint Manufacturing Station eftablifhed 
here, fome time ago, by the Board of Truftees for fifheries and 
manufactures. While this work continued it was of great fer- 
vice to this parilh, but it has been long fince given up. The 
houfe, where the fuperintendant lived, ftands at the end of the 
Meikle Loch, and could be repaired at a fmali expence, fo as 
to be occupied again. 

\ The clergyman of the village could perform thefe good 
offices, to fuch of them as are contiguous to him. But it is a

and populous charge for one clergyman. Colgach would com- 
prehend two of thefe diftricts ; one of which would be con- 
fined to Ullapool and its environs, confifting of upwards of 
iooo fouls. The A'ird of Coigach would form another diftrict, 
which is feparated from the Ullapool diltrict, by an extenfive 
track of mofs, mountains, and rocks. In this diftrict there 
are upwards of 600 fouls; and fome of the tenants there, with 
the concurrence of the proprietor, made lately a very laud- 
able attempt to obtain a miflion from the Society for Pro- 
pagating Christian Knowledge, in which we are forry 
they did not fucceed. The Society, though potfefted of ample 
funds, think it necefTary to ftipulate for their miffions, terms 
and conditions which the Highland proprietors are fo unwil- 
ling to comply with, that few of them are likely to take place. 
It has been faid, and not without reafon, that the fociety's great 
funds would be more productive of good and extenfive effects, 
if they fettled their miffions independently on any ftipulations 
with the proprietors of eftates ; as in this cafe, the people im- 
mediately reaping the benefit of a miffion, would furnifh the 
incumbent with the more neceffary accommodations, fuch as 
a dwelling-houfe and a place of worfhip; that with regard to a 
glebe, which is the principal obftruclion, it fhould never be 
infifted on as a neceflary condition for the efiablilhment of a 
miffion. In fome cafes, a miffionary would not occupy a 
glebe though he had it, and, in moft places, if he was dif- 
pofed to keep a few cattle, he tould always, for a little rent, 
obtain grafs for them, either from the tenants or proprietor ; 
and that according to the prefent mode of fettling miffions 
adopted by the Society, thofe places, that have moft need, 
have leaft chance of being provided with them. The Society, 
however, muft have good reafons for their proceedings, 
though it is to be regretted that the effects fhould thus, 
though contrary to their intention, retard the object they 
have in view to promote. The enlightening of thefe be- 
nighted

nighted corners, for whofe improvement and happinefs the 
pious intended their liberal bequefts, is an object of fuch 
importance, that it were to be wiihed matters could be fet- 
tled on a more favourable footing. It is hard indeed, that if 
a poor ignorant let of people, in an obfeure corner, have the 
misfortune to be under a niggardly or a poor proprietor, that 
does not care a farthing for their fouls or bodies further than 
to get his rents, they ihould fuffer on that account, and be 
deprived of the bleilings which their more feeling Chriftian 
brethren intended them. The 3d diftrict of Lochbroom 
might comprehend Little Strath, Strathnafailg, the Laich, CSV. 
and would alfo ftand in need of a million. It contains about 
880 fouls. The 4th, and the laff. diffrict, might comprehend 
the reft of this parifh, viz. Meikle Strath, arid other places 
contiguous to the pariih church, which confift of about 950 
fouls. 

Antiquities- — Here maybe feen the ruins of feveral old for- 
tifications. But the traditions concerning them are fo various 
and doubtfu;, that nothing certain can be determined with 
regard to their original. In an Ifland, on the fouth-weft of 
this parifli, may be feen two large coves, one on the north 
fide of the iflaud, and the other on the louth. That on the 
north would be fufficiently large for 50 men, either to fit or 
lie down in. It is faid to have been inhabited by a Popilh 
prieft, who ufed to fhift his quarters from one cove to ano. 
ther, as the weather directed. It ftill retains th,e name of 
Priejl Ijland.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6415798">KIRKOSWALD</name>, 

(County and Prefbytery of Ayr. — Synod of Glafgow 

and Ayr.) 

By the Reverend Mr Matthew Biggar, Minijler of that 

Pari/b*.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Nome. 

THE common tradition concerning the name of this pa- 
rifh, carries us fo far into the dark ages of the Scotch 
Hiftory, that it will not be very interefting to the public. 
The tradition, however, which has been handed down for 
near thefe 200 years, is as follows : During the heptarchy 
in England, the King of Northumberland was flain in battle, 
and his army routed by a neighbouring prince. Oswald, 
the king's eldeft fon, having made his efcape from the field 
of battle, fled to the king of Scots, by whom he was moft 
favourably received, and railed to the command of his armies. 
Some time after, Ofwald led the Scots army againft the 
Strathcltryde Britons, with whom the king was at war, and 
both armies came in fight of each other near this place. Upon 
the day before the battle, Ofwald made a vow, that if he 

ihould 

* It deferves to be recorded, to the honour of this worthy 
clergyman, that his ftatiftical account was drawn up under all 
the difadvantages of blindnefs, which has not however impair, 
ed his energy of mind, or damped his zeal, for promoting the 
good of his country. 



of Kirkofwald. 475 

fhould obtain the victory, he Would build a church upon, 
the field of battle. Victory having declared in his favour, 
he performed his vow, and gave his own name to the church. 
The veltiges of a fmall circular camp about half an Eflglifh 
mile to the l'outh, and the great number of large whin or muir 
ftones that were lately (landing about 200 yards to the eaft, 
of this place, in Fuch a form as might give reafon to fuppofe 
that thole who fell in the battle were buried there, are cir- 
cumftances which feem to confirm the tradition. Some time 
after, Ofwald got pofieffion of his father's kingdom ; and, 
being zealous for the eflablifhment of Chriftianity, and very 
friendly to the clergy, was, after his death, canonized as a 
Saint. It is well known that, within the antient kingdom 
of Northumberland, there is a town called Kirkofwald, after 
this king. In this town there is an annual fair upon the fifth 
day of Auguft j and there has, for time immemorial, been 
a fair in this place on the fame day. This fact feems alfo to 
countenance the above tradition. 

Situation, Erefiion, Extent, and Profpefts.— The parifh is 
fituated in that dHtrict of Ayrfhire, called Carrick, and in 
the prefbytery of Ayr. Prior to 1 65 2, the extent of this 
parilh was confiderably larger than it is at prefent. At that 
time the parifh of Barr was erected from the high and dis- 
tant parts of the parifhes of Girvan, Dailly, and Colmonel. 
To make up what was taken from the parifhes of Dailly and 
Girvan, a confiderable track of land upon the north-weft fide 
of the water of Girvan, amounting to a fourth part of this 
parifh, was annexed to Dailly and Girvan. The greater 
part by far of the proprietors lands have been exactly mea- 
fured ; and by taking the mean length and breadth of the 
whole, there appear to be near 11 000 Scots acres. The lea- 
coaft of the parilh from north to fouth is fix Englifh miles ; 

the

the greater part of which is a fandy beach, with a beautiful 
and rich carpet of grafs, to the very fea-mark. From every 
part of this coafl there is a beautiful profpect of the Frith 
of Clyde, land-locked, as it were, on all fides, by the coaft 
of Cunningham, ifland of Bute, ifland of Arran, Kintyre, 
the coaft of Ireland, and the coaft in the parifhes of Kirkum, 
Ballanrrae, Colmonel, and Girvan. The fcene, varied by 
the different height and appearance of the above coafts, with 
the many fmall iflands interfperfed along them, renders the 
whole view mod delightful. What add* to the beauty and 
grandeur of the profpect, is the noble rock of slil/a, fet 
down in the middle of the Frith. This coaft commands the 
neareft, moft diftinct, and regular view of this rock. In a 
clear day, it is eafy to difcern the remains of a caftle upon it, 
with feveral roads diverfified by fpots of verdure. It Hands, 
in a circular form, about 15 Englifh miles from the fhore, 
and belongs to the Earl of Cafiillis *. 

The half of this coaft towards the north is very favour- 
able for lea-bathing ; partly becaufe the lea gradually deep- 
ens for a confiderable way, while the bottom is perfectly 
clear of all rocks and ftones \ but chiefly becaufe it lies at 
a confiderable diftance from any fr-efh water, being. 8 miles 
ibuth from the river of Poon, and 4 miles north from that 
of Girvan. At prefent the principal inconvenience for bath- 
ing, is the want of proper habitations. 

Ecclejiafiical State. — The King is patron of the parifli f.

* Though it be always ftated as belonging to the paiifh of 
Dailly, being annexed to a Barony, the property of the Earl 
of Caffillis, in that parifli, yet the tackfmen of it have, from 
time immemorial, refided in this parifli.

The ftipend of this parifh is in money 33 1. 5 s 2d Sterling ; 
for communion elements 3 1. 6s 8d Sterling; in meal 43 
bolls 1 firlot ; and in bear 20 bolls and 3 firlots : There is alfo 
a glebe confifting of 1 acre 3 roods of natural meadow, and 
4 acres of arable ground, excluiive or the lite of the manfe, 
the offices, and the garden. The decreet of locality and mo- 
dification for the above ftipends, was given in the year 1650. 
About two years ago, a decreet of augmentation was obtain- 
ed for 25 1. Sterling additional ftipend. It is uncertain 
when the old church of Kirkofwald was built. It feems to 
have undergone many alterations. It ftands in a very low 
fituation, furrounded by a very large burying place, which 
is walled in. In 1777 a new church was built upon a riling 
ground, a very little to the fouth of the former, fit to hold 800 
hearers, from a plan, and under the direction, of David Earl 
of Caffillis, who is relident proprietor of above two-thirds 
of the parifh ; and it is confidered as one of the neateft 
churches in this country. This church is 68 feet by 31 
within the walls, having a gallery in each end, and an aifle, 
with a fire room, finifhed at the expence of the Earl of Caf- 
fillis, and which he is obliged to keep up. The prefent 
manfe was built in the year 1770, upon a plan by Thomas 
Earl of Caffillis, and is a very neat and convenient houfe. 
There were never any feceders in this parifh till the year 
1 790, when one family came from Jkith, of the burgher per- 
fualion. 

School, 

Mr Cupples, his immediate predeceffor, was ordained in 1720, 
of whom this particular circumllance is recorded, that he was 
the firft miniftcr in Scotland, who, according to the acl of Af- 
fembly, gave in his letter of acceptance to the prefbytery, with 
the Crown prefentation. His predeceffor, Mr Adam, who was 
the firft minifkr after the re-eftablifhment of prefbytery, was 
ordained in 1694. The laft Epiicopal minifter, Mr Claud Ha- 
milton, was. appointed here in 1670, and retired to Maybole in 
1691. 



V* Stati/lical Account 

School.— There is an eftablifhed fchoolmafter, with a falary 
of no more than 100 merks Scotch, which is by far too 
fmall, as he enjoys no other advantage whatever, except the 
wages he receives from his fcholars, together with the emo- 
luments of feffion clerk and precentor : He is obliged to 
rent his dwelling houfe and garden. The heritors pay rent 
for a fchool- houfe. As the molt populous parts of the pa- 
rilh are at the diftance of four miles, it is very inconvenient 
for young children to attend the public fchool. Private 
fchools are therefore kept in thefe parts of the parilh. 

Population.— As this article is moft important and effential 
in ftatiftical accounts, it demands peculiar attention. There 
has been preferved an old feffion regifter, conducted with 
great exaclnefs, from 1611 to 1661, and from 1694 to the 
prefent day. The following is an extract from Dr Webfter's 
account of the population in 1755 : ' The number of iouls 
4 in Kirkofwald is 1168, number of fighting men from the 
« age of 18 to 56 is 233/ From thefe, and a careful infpec- 
tion and vifitation of the parilh in 791 and 1792, the po- 
pulation of the parilh at different periods may be afcertaincd* 
On the ninth of February 1640, the folemn league and 
covenant Was fworn to, and fubferibed by the inhabitants of 
this parilh. The original Was depofited in the hands of the 
minifter, Mr John Burne, and a copy inferted in the records 
of the kirk feffion. This copy is ftill extant. From it we 
learn that the parilh contained precifely 300 males who 
were difpofed and qualified to engage in this tranfaclion. 
Fifty-eight, including the minifter, fubferibed their own 
names ; — 242, with their hands at the pen, authorifed pu- 
blic notaries to fubferibe for them. Suppofing the number 
who fubferibed to comprehend only the males above 20, 
the population at that time mull have been little inferior to 

what 



of Kirkofwald.

what it is at prefent. But it muft be remembered, that the 
extent of the parifh is qow diminiflied one fourth by the a- 
bove mentioned annexation to Girvan and Dailly j and that 
probably fonse males below 20 would, of themfelves, be am- 
bitious, or prompted by others, to enroll their names in fo 
popular a deed : Accordingly, we (hall afterwards find rea- 
fon to conclude, that the inhabitants are now a fifth part 
more numerous than they were a century and a half ago. 
In 1720, at Mr Cupples' ordination, it appears from the re- 
gifter of the parilh, that the population amounted nearly tQ 
1 168 fouls, being exactly the fame number as in Dr Webfter ? s 
account : Confequently the population of the parifh, from 
1720 to 1755, appears to have been almoft ftationary. In the 
year 1791, the inhabitants were numbered, and it was found, 
that, daring the laft 40 years, they had increafed 167. The 
reiult of this enumeration may be fpecified as follows: 

Number of males - 643 Num. of fouls between 10 

r : — r females 692 and 20 - 264 

20 &amp; 50 516 

Total number of fouls 1335 , ■ 50 &amp; 70 153 

Married perfons 392 , 79 &amp; p0 ^ 

Widows a/id widowers 65 L 
Num. of fouls below 1 0 358 

There are at prefent nq remarkable inftances of longevity. 
The oldeft man in the parim is not above 87. But during 
the laft ten years, feveral have died confiderably above 90. 
The following table exhibits an abftxact of the parochial re- 
gifter of marriages, baptifms, and burials, from the com- 
mencement of the regifter of each, to the ift of January 
1 79 1, with the annual average for every ten years, fractions 
omitted.

* In the above account of marriages, thofe are excluded, 
which probably were not confummated in this parifli. Thefe, 
during the courfe of the above period, amount to 191. Di- 
viding the baptifms by the marriages, exclufive of the above 
191, the average of births from each marriage is only from 3 to 
4, or fully 7 births for every 2 marriages But, as in the table 
of births, the fruit of thofe marriages, which were celebrated 
in other parifhes, and confummated here, is included ; it may 
perhaps be proper, in comparing the marriages and births, to 
include alfo thofe marriages which were celebrated here, and 
confummated in other parifhes. If, then, this be done, by add- 
ing the above 191 to the marriages, the average of births from 
each marriage will be from 4 to 5. Subtracting the burials 
from the baptifms, the total furplus of baptifms is 908, for the 
laft 70 years, which amounts nearly to 13 annually. As the 
population has, during that time, only increafed 167, the total 
emigration is 741, and the annual average nearly 10.

Divifion and Occupations of the Inhabitants.— -There are 280 
inhabited houfes in the parifh, each containing from r to 17 
fouls; and at an average almoft 5. Of 8 heritors only 4 are 
refident. Of thefe the Earl of Caffillis, who is proprietor 
of more than uvo-thirds of the parifh, is the principal. 
The bulk of the inhabitants are farmers, who pofTefs at 
an average about 130 acres of ground. The leafes are all for 

19 years. In the tacks aflignees are excluded, and fornc- 
times the power of fubfetting. The number of tenants is 
76; of fubtenants 26. 

All perfonal fervices from the tenant to the proprietor are 
entirely abolifhed, except the leading of coals to the mailer ; 
and in each tack the particular quantity the tenant is bound 
to lead is fpecified. 

Servants of every defcription do not exceed 120. The 
females are rather more numerous than the males. About 

20 of both fexes are employed in domeftic fervices ; the reft 
in managing the dairy and farm. The bulk of them, being 
unmarried, eat in their matters houfes ; and, at an average, 
the males receive 61. and the females 3 i. Sterling, per annum. 
About 14 male fervants are married, and live with their own 
families. Thefe, at an average, receive 5 1. a-year, and are 
allowed, by their mafters, a houle and yard, 5§ bolls of meal 
yearly, a milch cow maintained fummer and winter, and the 
growing of a few potatoes ; all which renders their Mate more 
comfortable, and their continuance in their matter's fervice 
more certain than thofe of the unmarried fervants *. Cot- 
tagers are in number 109, and rent from the farmer a houfe 

and 

* So fmall a number of labouring fervants is not adequate 
to the half of the Lbour. The remainder is performed partly 
by the farmers themfelves and their families, and partly by 
cottagers.

and yard at 1 1. per annum, a cow's grafs at I 1. per annum^ 
and an acre or two of land, for which they pay fomething 
more than the principal tack duty. Some of them are bound 
to work for their matter during the harveft, for which they 
receive the fee ufual in the country ; others are bound to 
work during the winter half year, and receive their meat in 
the houfe : During the remainder of the year, they are em- 
ployed with the other cottagers in ditching and dyke build- 
ing, and other labours of hufbandry. There is one particu- 
lar ipecies of labour begun to be pra&amp;ifed in this country, 
called Jobbing. The farmers let the whole threfhing of their 
crop to thefe cottagers at lod. per boll, as it meafures when 
cleared of the chaff. They alfo let the cutting down of 
their whole crop from 4 s. to 5 s. per acre ; and the mowing 
of their hay at 1 s. 6 d. per acre. Tradefmen and fifliermen, 
who have a permanent abode in the parilh, with one grocer, 
amount altogether to 73, and inhabit 59 houfes. 

Thus, at the end of July 1792, the diviGon and occupa- 
tions of the inhabitants of this partflh might be ftated as fol- 
lows :

Among the above number are feven licenfed retailers of 
ale and Britifh fpirits. There is one licenfed retailer of 
wine and foreign fpirits, who refides in the village. One 
poft chaife is kept here for hire : A diligence goes three 
times a-week between Ayr and Portpatrick, which changes 
horfes at Kirkofwald. Forty years ago, there was no com- 
munication between this place and Ayr, the head town of 
the county, but by a riding poft on Tuefday, and a foot poft: 
on Thurfday : No carrier whatever palled by this to Ayr. 
Some families in this part of the country, connected with 
the Courts of Seffion and Exchequer, gave fome bufinefs to 
a carrier from Maybole to Edinburgh once a fortnight. Now 
a riding pofl; from Ayr to Girvan paffes this place every 
day. Two carriers with carts pafs once a week from 
Girvan to Ayr j and one carrier from Girvan to Glafgow 
once a week. To all this is to be added, that poft horfes 
and chailes are ready at all times at Girvan, Maybole, and 
this place, together with the above mentioned diligence. 

Surface, Soil, csV. csV.— -The furface is hilly. The hills, 
except in two places, called Mochrum and Craigdow, never 
rife to any confiderable height. Near Mochrum, there is a 
loch which covers 24 Scots acres, and another, apparently 

as 



4 8 4 



Siati/lical Account 



as large, near Craigdow. Thefe lochs either do not abound 
in fiflj, or the filhings are totally neglected. From them, and 
from numberlefs fprings which rile out of every hill, flow- 
many fmall ftreams, which wander through the pariih, and 
afford abundance of pure water. Except, the very tops of 
Mochrum and Craigdow, and a few fpors of mofs, the whole 
pari T. is arable." 

There is little or no natural wood in the parifh. But the 
wants of this is happily f applied by the plantations made by 
the Earl of Caflillis and Sir Adam Ferguflbn. The former 
has, within thefe few years, planted upon his eftate, and efpe. 
cially in his policy, 560 acres ; and, notwithftanding their 
proximity to the Sea, the trees are exceedingly thriving. 
Sir Adam Ferguflbn, on that part of his eftate in this parifh 
which lies on the north fide of the water of Gii van, and op- 
pofite to his feat of Kilkerran, has planted 240 acres, all of 
which are in the moft thriving condition. The foil of the 
parifh is different. The difference in the kind of foil is mark- 
ed nearly by the great port road from Ayr to Girvan, which 
paffes through the whole length of the pariih from N\ to S. 
Between this road and the fea-fhore, comprehending about 
4000 acres of land, the foil is generally a very rich loam, 
mixed with a conflderable quantity of chy. There are few 
or no banks of fand, and the land is dry, and favourable for 
pafture or the plough, even to the fea-mark. To the fouth 
and eaft of the above poff. road, the ground rifes confider- 
ablyj the foil is more light, upon a free-flone bottom, inter- 
mixed alfo with fome clay ; and is upon the whole more 
wet than the land towards the fhore. 

State of Agriculture.— Notwithftanding the advantages of 
foil, and other circumftances, this parifh was, forty years ago, 
generally in a wild and uncultivated ftate. Indeed, there 

were 



of Kirkofivald. 



were feveral inclofurcs, and fome very fine old trees, about 
Cullean Caftle. But the fences were moftly of ftone. Of 
thefe inclofures, the moft remarkable was that called the Cow 
Park of Cullean, containing about 50 acres, which had been in 
pafture for two hundred years, yet there is not, to this day, 
to be feen in it the fmalleft fpot of fog. There was alfo the 
park of Turnberry, containing about 460 acres, which was 
inclofed with ftone about the beginning of the century, and 
has been in pafture ever fince *. All the reft of the parifh 
was then perfectly open, except the tenants kail yards, which 
were fenced in a very coarle manner, with land ftories and 
turf, and the greater part without any planting. The te- 
nants yards on the coaft were fenced with an earthen dyke. 
On this was planted ader, (or, according to the vulgar name, 
bountree,) which thrives exceedingly, affords great fhelter, 
and is difliked by all cattle and fheep. This almoft total 
want of planting and inclofures, gave a dreary look to the 
whole, parifh. 

The tillage and pafture lands were under equally bad ma- 
nagement. The farms upon the fhore, the richeft part of 
the parifh, were then of great extent, each containing above 
200 acres. The farm houfes, pleafantly fituated near the 

fhore, 

* About fifty years ago, the late Mr Gilbert Blane of Blane- 
field, began to inclofe by ditch and hedge, and made a confi- 
derable extent of fences in that way, moft of them double ; and 
in the fpace between the double fences, he planted a great many 
foreft trees. But fuch was the general averfion which the 
country people then had to improvements of that kind, that it 
was not in his power to preferve them from being pulled out 
and deftroyed ; fo that few of thefe inclofures are now ufeful, 
and little of the planting remains. 

Mr Blane was likewife the firft perfon in the parifh who in- 
troduced the improvement of land by lime, and gave an expe- 
rimental proof that the moft barren heath could, by means of 
that manure, be converted in a very fhort time into excellent 
pafture. 



486 



Staiiftical Account 



ihore, had round them about 30 or 40 acres of croft ground. 
The reft of the farms went back to the higher grounds of 
the parilh, and was called out- field. Their croft land had 
been iminemorially in tillage, without one year's reft. They 
commonly manured the third part of it with fea-weed, which 
they carried upon horfes backs (for not one tenant in the 
parifh had a fingle cart) during the three months of winter. 
At candlemas they ploughed it down. In the beginning of 
May they gave it another fur, and then fowed bear upon it. 
This, by the moft intelligent, was followed with only one 
crop of oats, and then with a crop of peafe j and the fea- 
weed fucceeded the peafe crop. Part of their croft ground 
was alfo manured with dung, which they fowed with bear, 
any time between Whitfunday and the end of May. They 
were accuftomed to manure fuch parts of their out-field land 
as they wifhed to plough, by inclofing their cattle upon it 
in folds. From the land thus manured, they generally took 
four crops of oats. It was obferved that the crop was always 
ftrongeft on thofe parts of the field, on which the earth^that 
had compoied the fold dyke was fpread. The fame mode 
of culture took place in the higher grounds, to the fouth of 
what is now the poft road. In procefs of time, they began 
to fpread lime, which they brought on horfes backs from 
the parifh of Dailly, upon their folds. They ufually gave 
about 20 bolls to the acre, reckoning 2 bufhels of fhells to 
the boll. From the ground there manured, they took five 
crops of oats. They alfo began to improve their croft land 
with lime, by fowing with the hand, immediately after they 
had fown their peafe, half a boll of flaked lime to every hall 
peck of peafe. 

About twenty years ago, the hufbandry of this parifh un- 
derwent a total and happy revolution. The farms were con- 
fiderably diminifhed in extent, the boundaries were properly 

flraighted, 



of Kirkofwald, 



487 



ftraighted, and they began to be inclofed and fubdivided with 
ditch and hedge. Almoft, in the courfe of ten years, the 
farms in the whole parifh, were thus inclofed and divided. 
The fheep were entirely banifhed ; and inftead of five or fix 
mean looking horfes, every farmer got four horfes, each of 
them equal in ftrength and value to two of their former ones, 
with a cart horfe to each. Sir Thomas Kennedy, afterwards Earl 
of Cafiillis, took the lead in this improved mode of agricul- 
ture. He enlarged, to a great extent, the farm and policy 
about Ctillean Caftle, and placed the direction of the whole 
under the deceafed Mr Foulis, who lived near Elintone. 
About the fame time, Sir Adam FergufTon brought into this 
parilh fome farmers of great fkill in hufbandry. Both thefe 
proprietors, and all the other heritors, in their new tacks, 
took the tenants bound to fuch wife regulations, and fuch a 
proper rotation of crops, as have contributed greatly to the 
improved ftate of agriculture in this parifh. The tenants firft 
of all laid down their croft lands with rye grafs and clover, 
took one crop of hay, fometimes two, and refted them four 
years in pafture. Then they began to their out-field. The 
whole fyftem of folding was given up. They were bound in 
their tacks not to break up any of their out-field, without 
lime or dung, to take two crops of oats, and lay down with 
the third ; or to take the third crop in peafe, and lay down 
with the fourth. Such, in general, were the ffipulations in 
the tack. But when the tenant had a great quantity of coarfe, 
ftiff, out-field land, he was indulged by his mafter in taking 
three crops of oats, and in laying down with the fourth. 
Some farms have been fo fituated with refpett to their ftiff 
out-field, as to find it neceflary to take their fourth crop of 
peafe, and lay down with new dung with the fifth. In the 
fouth part of the parifh, by far the moft extenfive, as con- 
taining about 6000 acres of ground, there is fome out-field 

covered

covered with a very ftrong heath. In mod parts the foil be- 
low is a ftrongdeep clay. This, with the heath roots, ren- 
ders it incapable of being fubdued without a very great ex- 
pence of lime and labour. To provide ngainft this, the prac- 
tice of paring and burning has, with great advantage, been 
introduced. The paring, generally, cofts about i 1. per acre. 
So foon as the weather permits, the furface is burnt, and the 
afhes fpread over the field. The good farmer, during the 
fummer months, adds 40 bolls of lime to the acre. If, after 
harveft, the ground is dry, it is plowed. In the fpring it is 
fown with oats. Three crops are taken, and it is fown dowa 
with rye grafs in the fourth. Some field?, cultivated in this 
way, have yielded upwards of five bolls per acre, the fecond 
year, with a prodigious quantity of ftraw, and at laft good 
pafture, where before an acre would not have fattened a 
flieep. In liming the grounds, where the foil is ftifF and 
coarfe, they give 100 bolls per acre, where it is lefs fo 80; 
and in light thin foils 60 anfwer perfectly well. When they 
go over their ground a fecond time, they generally ufe a 
compoft of earth and lime, allowing one third lefs of lime 
than formerly. This has fucceeded exceedingly well. By 
attending to this practice, and by taking great care of their 
hedges, this parifh now exhibits a ftate of improved agricul- 
ture, fuperior to moft of the diftri&amp;s of Carrick. 

The tenant, however, labours under confiderable difficulty 
in procurimg lime. Almoft all of it muft be brought from 
the parifh of Dailly, acrofs the moft hilly part of this parifh 
to the fouth. The medium diftance from the lime quarry 
to the Chore part of the parifh, is about five Englifh miles. 
But the length of the road is not the chief difficulty. Many 
parts of the road are fo fteep and rugged, that the farmer, at 
the above diftance, with horfes at 18 1. price, cannot bring 
more than feven bufliels in a one horfe cart, and can load 

but

but once a day. Notwithftanding all this, it appears, by a 
note from the clerks of the lime works, there were brought 
into this parifh in fummer 1791, 48,000 bufhels of lime 
fliells. 

Several marie pits have been found, within thefe three 
years, in thofe parts of the parifh which lie at the greateft 
diftance from, the lime, and within an Englifh mile of the 
fea. So eafily is the marie wrought, that one farmer with 
6 horfes, manured 30 acres in fummer 1791. It is put out 
of the pit, ready to be taken away at 1 d. per cart, and 80 
cart loads are allowed to each acre. The farms thus manured 
promife to be foon in a high ftate of cultivation. 

When fpeaking of the different kinds of manure, one cir- 
cumftance deferves to be mentioned. On a farm upon the 
fhore, there have been obferved from time immemorial, with- 
in 30 yards of the fea-mark, two large hillocks, 10 yards 
diftant from each other, covered with fand and bent. About 
1 2 years ago, by a violent ftorm from the fea, the end of one 
of the hillocks was uncovered, and there appeared fomething 
like coal afhes. This called the farmers attention, who im- 
mediately opened up the hillock, and difcovered a prodigi- 
ous quantity. Thefe afhes were ufed as manure, firft upon 
ley ground, and afterwards, mixed with lime, on light croft 
ground, with little or no fuccefs j but were found to anfwer 
well for garden roots. Although above 1000 large cart loads 
have been taken, yet there remain in the two hillocks, at a 
moderate computation, above 3000 loads more. Tradition 
does not inform us whence thefe afhes came in fuch quantity. 
There is no veftige of any building whatfoever, nearer than 
the old farm-houfe, and the place is 4 Englifh miles diftant 
from any coal work. It has been fuppofed they are the ef- 
fete of barbarous fuperftition in times of idolatery in this 
country.

The prevailing crop in this parifh is oats, which are of an 
exceeding good quality, though not of the early kind. Some 
oats have been known to weigh 4Z libs. Englifh, per Winchef- 
tcr bufhel, and to yield 21 pecks of meal per boll. As the 
foil of the parifh is generally light, the next prevailing crop is 
bear, which is of a very fine quality for malt. Some of the 
bear in this parifh weighs 50 libs. Englifh per bufhel. Bar- 
ley crops are not fo frequent, becaufe, though good in quali- 
ty, yet the crop fails a fourth part in quantity when compared 
to bear. Some peafe and beans are alfo fown, but they are 
often with difficulty brought fafe into the barn-yard. The 
farmers plant considerable quantities of potatoes, which they 
manage with the plough in rows, at 3 feet diftance. Few 
or no farmers think of lefs than an acre, producing 40 bolls, 
chiefly for their family ufe ; the boll nearly 10 Winchefter 
bufhels. The turnip hufbandry has been very little praclifed 
in this jparifh, except on Lord CaffiU's farm at Cullean Caf- 
tle, where it has been very fuceefsful. Moft people think 
the foil of the parifh, in general, favourable for turnip, and 
feveral farmers have thoughts of trying it. 

The great change that has taken place in the corn mrlns, 
both in refpect of the tenure of the milns, and the manner 
of performing the work, has much contributed to the encou- 
ragement of agriculture in this parifh. Forty years ago, the 
landlord obliged the tenant in his tack, to go to his own miln, 
with all his grindable corn above his feed, and to pay to the 
miller a very heavy multure. But now many of the gentle- 
men of property, leave the tenant free to go to any miln 
upon their land, where he can be beft ferved, paying to the 
miller nothing more than the mere working of his grain, 
which is from 4 d. to 5 d. per boll of oats grinding into meal ; 
the victual boll exadly eight Winchefter bufhels. There 

were no barley milns in this country forty years ago. There 

are 



of Kirkofwald. 



49 1 



are now in this parifli two barley milns, which make this necef- 
fary article to any degree of finenefs, at the rate of from 20 d. 
to 2 s. per boll. This circumftance encourages the farmer to 
fow barley inftead of bear, as there is at all times a ready 
market for the made barley, among the (lore farmers in the 
Highlands of Carrick. To this may be added, that 40 years 
ago, every tenant dryed his oats upon his own kiln, conftruc- 
ted in a very coarle manner. Now every miln in the parifh 
has a kiln adjoining to it, properly bottomed with tyle, and 
fo conftruded as to go with every wind. Thefe dry grain at 
the low price of from 1 d. to 2 d. per boll. Indeed the far- 
mers, who have a very great tillage, are now getting kilns of 
this fort, upon their own farms, at their own expence. What, 
however, adds to the charge of the farmer in this article, is 
the diftance from coal proper for the purpofe of drying ; 
which cannot be got nearer than 15 miles from this place. 

The dairy was in a moft negletted ftate in this parifh for- 
ty years ago. Good butter and cheefe were fcarcely to be 
found. Now the milk cows are changed to the better, are 
put into parks {own down with white and yellow clover, and 
when they live in the houfe by night or by day, are fed upon 
cut red clover. Every {leading of farm houfes has an apart- 
ment by itfelf for a milk houfe, and every conveniency fuited 
to it. Both butter and cheefe are now exported from the pa- 
rifh to the markets of Ayr and Paifley. Butter in 1791 fold 
for 8 s. and new milk cheefe for 4 s. 8 d. per Englifh frone. 

There i-s very little lint fown in this parifli. The foil is 
thought to be in general too light for it. 

Many of the farmers now fatten cattle for the market, be- 

fides bringing up a number of young cattle every year. They 

never have been in the ufe of rearing their own horfes, which 

would be a great faving. They are commonly purchafed from 

Ireland. The number of labouring horfes in the parifh is 

300.

Slatiflical Account 



300. The frock of milk an4 yeild cattle varies every year 
according to the tillage and pafture in the fevcral farms. 

The principal export from the parifh, to the manufactur- 
ing towns, is oat-meal and hear. In the year 1783, therr. 
was exported from this parifh, of crop 1782, which failed 
through almoft the whole of Scotland, ahove 1200 bolls of 
oat-meal. At prefent, there are above 1500 bolls of oat-meal 
exported annually, to the manufacturing towns, bpfides bear 
and potatoes. 

State of Manufaflures .—The people are moftly employed 
in farming operations. In no one part of the parifh, except 
the village of Kirkofwald, is there any number of houfes to- 
gether. In the village there are only 17 families. In thefe 
circumftances it cannot be expected, that manufactures can 
be any way very prevalent. Within thefe two years a thread 
miln, and a carding and fpinning machine for wool, have 
been erected, and are now fuccefsfully employed. It were to 
be wifhed that the proprietors of land would give every pro- 
per encouragement to undertakings of this kind, in a parifh 
where labour is cheap, and where there is plenty of all kinds 
of good provifions. There is one fpecies of manufacture in 
this parifh, which ought not to omitted ; that is, the manu- 
facturing of wool into coarfe blanketing and plaiding. This 
is chiefly carried on by the farmers, who have a number of 
daughters or female fervants, and by the cottagers and their 
families. A number of the farmers import from Argylefhire 
and Galloway, great quantities of wool •, which is fpun and 
woven in this parifh, and fold at the markets of Maybole and 
Ayr. 

Upon the coaft of this parifh, cod, ling, haddock, &amp;x. 
are fo plenty, as occafionally to attract different companies 
of fifhermen from Ayr. Lately a falmon fifhery has been be- 
gun 



of Kirkofwald,

gun on this coaft, which promifes to be very produftivc. 
White fifli fell for I d. and falmon from 2 d. to 5 d. per lib *.

• Antient and Modern Buildings — Upon a fmall promontory 
on the barony of Turnberry, now the property of the Earl of 
Cafllllis, are the ruins of the famous caftle of Turnberry, the feat 
of the Lads of Carrick. When or by whom it was built, is al- 
together uncertain. Authentic hiftory, however, informs us, 
that in 1274, Martha, Countefs of Carrick, lived in this her 
caftle, and was that year married to Robert Bruce Eail of An- 
nandale. From this marriage fprung the Kings of Scotland, of 
the race of Stewart. In 1 306, Turnberry was held by an Eng- 
lifti garrifon, under Earl JPercy ; and fome years after this we 
find that King Robert Bruce ilormed the caftle, ftill in pofteffion 
of the Englifti, routed and expelled the garrifon, but at the ex- 
pence of the deftrucYion of the building. After this we do not 
hear of its being inhabited. 

The fituation of this caftle is moil delightful, having a full 
profpeft of the whole firth of Clyde, as above deicribed. Upon 
the land fide, it looks over a rich plain of above 600 acres. 
This plain is bounded by the hills, which rife in a beautiful am- 
phitheatre. Little now is known as to the extent of this an- 
tient building. There ftill remain the veftige of a ditch, and 
part of the buttreflefs of the draw-bridge. There is a pafTage, 
which opens towards the fea, arched above, leading to a large 
apartment in the caftle, which by tradition is faid to have been 
the kitchen. This caftle has been built of whin-ftone, and is 
remarkable for the very ftrong cement that has been ufed in 
building it. The ruins, as they now lie, cover an acre of ground. 

The next remarkable old building in the parifh, is the Abbey 
of Crofsregall or CrofVreguill, founded by Duncan King of Scot- 
land, in 1260, fituated two miles eaft from the village. It is 
more entire than any abbey in the weft of Scotland. The fide 
walls of the church and choir ftill remain to the height of four- 
teen feet. It has been exceedingly well lighted within. To- 
wards the eaft remains the nitch, where the principal altar flood. 
On the right of this is the veftry, and the Abbot's ecclefiailical 
court, all entire, and arched very much in the ftyle of the Ca- 
thedral at Glafgow. There are belides, feveral vaults and cells, 
all built of fine hewn-ftone. At the eaft end of the abbey, (land 
the ruins of the Abbot's firft houfe, with only the outer walls 
remaining. On the weft end of the abbey, ftands the laft houfe 
which the Abbot inhabited ; in this the ftair is entire from top 
to bottom, with feveral apartments regularly divided, all of free-

flone. The whole building Hands in the middle of eight acres 
of ground, commonly called the Abbot's yard, or Precinct of 
Crofsreguill. This belongs to the chapel royal, and is let iu 
tack to the family of Kilkerran. it is fubfet to one of the te- 
nants of the barony of Balterfan, the property of the family ; 
in the middle of which rich and extenfive barony of land this 
abbey ftands. The above Precinct has been walled in with a 
very flrong ftone and lime wall, little of which is now remaining. 
This ruin is preferved with great care and attention, the tenants 
not being allowed to take down and ufe any ftone from the ab- 
bey itfelf. 

The next old building in the parifh, is the houfe or caftle of 
Thomafton, about half a mile to the fouth-eaft of Cullean. Tra- 
dition tells us, that this was built by a nephew of Robert Bruce, 
in the year 1335. It has been exceedingly ftrong, and of very 
confiderable extent. It was inhabited fifty years ago, and is 
now become the property of the Earl of Caffillis. 

Of the modern buildings in this parifh, the mod remarkable 
is Cullean caftle, founded by David late Earl of Caffillis, in 
the year 1777. This noble edifice is fituated upon a rock, pro- 
jecting a little into the fea, of about 100 feet in height from the 
furface of the water, and almoft perpendicular. The plan and 
defign were given by the late Mr Robert Adam ; and fuch is the 
ftyle of the architecture, fuch the execution of the work, and 
the beauty of the ftone, that it impreffes the mind with delight- 
ful ideas of elegance, order, and magnificence, exceeding any 
thing fimilar in the country. At a proper diftance from the 
caftle, ftand the ftables and farm-houfes ; planned by the fame 
architect, and executed upon the fame large fcale ; all of which, 
with the bridge of approach to the caftle, cover four acres of 
ground. The caftle commands, from the principal apartments, 
a delightful profpect of the whole Frith of Clyde, with a full view 
of the rok of Ailfa, fet down in the middle, the vefTels paffing to 
and from Clyde not far from its walls. On the land fide, and im- 
mediately below the caftle, are the gardens belonging to the 
old houfe of Cullean, formed out of rock, at a great expence, 
into three terraces; upon the walls of which are planted fome of 
the choiceft fruit trees. The remainder of the old gardens is 
formed into pleafure ground and gravel walks, kept with great 
care. Round the caftle, and the adjoining buildings, lies an 
extenfive policy of about 700 acres, interfperfed with many 

thriving 



of Kirkofwald.

able The valuation of the parifh, according to its prefent 
limits, is 3903 1. 1 8 s. Scots. The prefent rent is about 
4000 1. Sterling yearly. The fhore part of the parifh, com- 
prehending above 4000 acres, is rented from 1 s. to 8 s. per 
acre. Several farms of confiderable extent, give the higheft 
of thefe rents, and many others 1 5 s. per acre. The higher 
grounds of the parifh, to the fouth of the poft road, are ren- 
ted from 4 sy to 8 s. Forty years ago, the rent of the parifh. 
was exceedingly low. Farms upon the fhore, which now 
yield 1 5 s. per acre, did not give above 5 s. In the higher 
part of the parifli, there is a barony, confifting of above 1 100 
acres, which was at that time rented at 50 1. and it now gives 

280 1. 

thrivi-ng plantations ; the execution of which, together with a 
new garden and hot houfes, is carrying on with great tafte and 
elegance. Upon thefe accounts, this edifice is vifited with plea- 
fure by all perfons of tafte, whether refiding ia the country or 
ftrangers. 

Near to the caftle, and immediately under fome of the build- 
ings, are the coves or caves of Cullean. Thefe are fix in num- 
ber. Of the three towards the weft, the largeft has its entry 
as low as high water mark, the roof is about 50 feet high ; and 
has the appearance as if two large rocks had fallen together, 
forming a Gothic arch, though very irregular ; it extends in- 
wards about 200 feet, and varies in breadth. It communicates 
with the other two, which are both confiderably lefs, but of 
much the fame irregular form. Towards the eafl are the other 
three coves, which likewife communicate with each other. They 
are nearly of the fame height and figure with the former, but 
their extent has not been precifely afcertained. Whether thefe 
coves are natural or artificial, and if artificial, what has been their 
defign,no tradition whatever informs us. One circumftance, how- 
ever, cannot be omitted. To the largeft of the three weft-moft 
coves, is a door or entry, built of free-ftone, with a window three 
feet above the door, of the fame kind of work; above both thefe, 
there is an apartment, from which might be fent down what- 
ever could annoy the aftailants of the door. This laft circum- 
ftar.ee is well known to take place in many of the old caftles in. 
the country, and feems to indicate, that at leaft this part of the 
coves has been at one period or another, the abode of fome of 
the inhabitant of this country.

280 1. Sterling. A ftill greater rife has taken place in the 
eaftern part of the parifh towards Maybole. A farm confift- 
ing of 200 acres, not above half a mile from the church, 
was, forty years ago, let for 81. per annum, and in the fif- 
teenth year of the prefent tack, it is rented at 36 1. and muft 
rife in proportion at the expiration of this tack. Such is the 
ftate and rental of the grounds in the parifh, that if peace 
and good order, by divine providence, be continued in our 
country, and the ftate of manufactures continue to rife, under 
our prefent happy conftitution, the property of this parifh 
muft exceed in value, any in the whole diftrict of Carrick, 
according to its extent. 

One circumftance, however, muft not be omitted, which 
has confiderably retarded the improvement of this parifli, and 
that is fmuggling or illicit trade, which more or lefs has, at 
different times, been carried on in all the coaft parifhes of 
the country. This bufinefs was firft carried on here from the 
Ifle of Man, and afterwards to a confiderable extent from 
France, Oftend, and Gottenburgh. It, however, received a 
full check, by the commutation act, and the greater atten- 
tion and vigilance of his Majefty's revenue officers. Little is 
now done in that way, and it is to be hoped the time is faft 
coming, when this illicit trade will be at an end. Though 
the character and behaviour of thofe engaged in this bufinefs, 
were, for the mofi part, in other refpects good ; yet, with- 
out doubt, it produced very bad effects on the induftry of the 
people, and gave them a tafte for luxury and finery, that 
fpoiled the fimplicity of manners which formerly prevailed in 
this parifh. 

Coal. — Nothing is more wanted in this parifh, than a great- 
er quantity of coal. At prefent it is fupplied from the coal 
works in the parifh of Dailly. But the roads to thefe coal 

works

works are equally diftant and much worfe, than thofe above 
mentioned to the lime. Some attempts have been made, of 
late, to difcover coal in the parifh, but without iuccefs. There 
was indeed a coal mine in this parifh, but it was fet on fire 
about 45 years ago, and is ftill burning. Several methods 
have been tried to extinguish the fire, but they have proved 
ineffectual. It has been the opinion of the beft coal miners in 
the weft of Scotland, that if no part of the coal near the fire 
were to be wrought for a number of years, it would of courfe 
be foon extinguifhed. This method has accordingly been 
adopted, and the fire has gradually lefTened. The want of 
this coal has been a great lofs to this parifh, as it was a valu- 
able mine, confifting of 5 feams of coal, from 6 to 15 feet 
thick *. 

Manners. 

* The drynefs of the foil, the opennefs of the country, and 
the proximity of the fea, render the climate pure and falubrious. 
For thefe 40 years paft, no putrid fever or flux have appeared 
in the parifh. During the firlfc 20 years of the above period, a 
fever prevailed every lix or feven years, with a conli'. eiable de- 
gree of inflammation. It fpread molt rapidly, but, by the appli- 
cation of the accuftomed remedies of bleeding, and taking great 
quantities of weak diluting drink, it was not very mortal, not- 
withftanding its infectious nature. During the above period, 
the fmall pox prevailed at times without inoculation, and, when 
introduced into the parifh, few families efcaped. In Come, the 
difeafe was exceedingly fatal ; but it cannot be -ifceit ined from, 
the r«gifter how many died of it annually. Th 1 ftopping ? or 
croup, a difeafe frequent on the fea coaft never once made its 
appearance here, during the above mentioned period. The 
meafles and chincough have always been very favourable. Du- 
ring the laft 20 years, the fevers have taken a confiderable 
change. They are now, generally, ©f the flow nervous kind, and 
when introduced into the parifh, are by no means very preva- 
lent or mortal. This, in part, may be owing to the improved 
habitation of the farmers. Formerly theie were fmnll, and all 
the fick of the family crowded into one place, and kept fo clofe 
as to prevent the proper circulation of air. This change in the 
fevers may alfo have been caufed, by the great increafe of the

Manners. — There has been no great influx of Grangers in- 
to this parifli, for thefe forty years paft, till within thefe five 
years, when a considerable number of fober and induftrious 
farmers, tempted with the drynefs of the foil, and, as they 
thought, the cheapnefs of the ground, came from the other 
parts of the country, and fettled here. The native inhabitants 
have, from the beginning of the above period, in general, main- 
tained a character of great plainnefs and fimplicity of man- 
ners, a ftrong attachment to the eftablilhed religion of the 
country, and an uniform and decent regard to the ordinances 
thereof, both at home and in the neighbouring parifhes. No 
doubt, that refinement in the manner of living and drefs, 
which has taken place throughout the country, prevails alfo 
here. Owing, perhaps, to the prevalence of fmuggling, this 
took place here earlier than in the neighbouring pariflics. 
Perfons engaged in that trade, found it necefiary to go abroad, 
and enter into bufinefs with foreign merchants; and by deal- 
ing in tea, fpirits, and filks, brought home to their families 
and friends, the means of greater luxury and finery, and at 
the cheapefl rate. Perfons of this defcription, being alfo ob- 
liged to enter much into fociety, in their own country, there- 
by acquired a turn for hofpitality and entertainment at home. 
The other parts of the parifh, from the improved ftate of 
their farms, were both defirous and able, in fome degree, to 
follow the example of their neighbours. But amidft all this, 
they have prefer ved the fobriety of manners, and the decency 
of the Chrillian character ; for during the whole of the above 

period,

period, there has been only one tried by the judiciary, for 
violently beating a man in his own houfe ; and fuch were the 
alleviating circumftances of the cafe, that the pannel was only 
punilhed with a f j w weeks imprifonment. It may not be im- 
proper to compare with this, the flat e of morals in this pa- 
rifh about 1 80 years ago. It appears, from the regilter for- 
merly mentioned, that from 1610, to 1620, the raoft fla- 
grant violations of the Sabbath took place. It was, in fre- 
quent inftances, proved before the fcffion, that perfons were 
guilty of fifhing, and feliing their fifh openly in Maybole 
market ; that others winnowed their corn, and gave no rea- 
fon for fo doing, but that the wind was favourable ; that 
others openly walhed and dryed their cloaths; and that others 
were guilty of tuellying, as it is called, or fighting to the effta- 
fion of blood, in the church-yard, in the time of divine fer- 
vice. So frequent at .that period was the vice of drunkennefs, 
even on the Sabbath, that we find the feffion enacting, that 
no inn-keeper fhould fell on that day, more than two pints 
of ale to a company of three perfons. It further appears, from 
the fame regifter, that the vice of adultery was alfo very fre- 
quent. It would lcem, however, that the morals of the peo- 
ple after the year 1630, improved to a confiderable degree, 
and continued to improve long after 1640, when, as we have 
mentioned, the folemn league and covenant was figned in this 
parifh. 

Poor. — The number of poor has of late years greatly in- 
creafed. Forty years ago, the number of monthly penfioners 
upon the roll, was only feven. At prefent, the number is 21, 
who receive from is. 6 d. to 3 s. every month. Thefe dif- 
tributions are under the management of the minifter and kirk- 
feflion. At two other times of the year, immediately after 
the communion, and at new year's day, they diftribute to 

above 



5oo 



Statiftical Account 



above 40 perfons, to the amount of above 8 1. Sterling at 
each time. Thefe two large diftributions, are intended to 
enable the poor to purchafe fhoes and coals, and to pay their 
houl'e rent, which articles are now become much more ex- 
penfive than they were formerly. The funds for all this arife 
almoft wholly from the collections at the church door, from 
collections at private baptifms and marriages, in whatever 
part of the parifh they are celebrated, and alfo from the pri- 
vate charities of the rich, who, to their praile, do, in times 
of fcarcity, liberally contribute to this humane purpofe. But 
if the poor of the parifh have greatly increafed, lb thefe funds 
have to a proportionable degree alfo increafed. The feffion 
has not, therefore, been yet obliged to make application to 
non-refiding heritors; and it has been, and is the determined 
purpofe of all concerned in the management of the poor, to 
keep at the utmoft diftance from legal operation in their fup- 
ply. No doubt this can be more eafily done in a parifh like 
this, where there are no populous towns or villages, or num- 
bers of manufacturing people. The voluntary contributions 
would, however, be much greater, were it not for the great 
number of Irifh vagrants and beggars, who dailly travel the 
great poft road from Ayr to Port Patrick ; near to which, on 
both fides, ftands the greater number of the farmers houfes ; 
which are oppreffed by the importunate and violent cravings 
of thefe beggars. It were to be wifhed that the police of the 
country would remedy this evil,

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1010422">INVERKEITHING</name>. 

(Prefbytery of Dunfermline. — County and Synod of 

Fife.) 

By the Reverend Mr Andrew Robertson, Minijlcr.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 

INVERKEITHING, or Innerkeithing, is fuppofed to be 
derived from the Gaelic word Inver or Inner, which fig- 
nifies the Mouth, and Keith, faid to be the name of the 
running water at the eaft end of the town. It is of a very irre- 
gular figure. The North Ferry hills form a peninlula ; the weft 
part, formerly the parifh of Rofyth, extends about three 
miles, and the north part about three miles and an half, from 
the town. Thefe refemble two arms ftretched out almoft at 
right angles, and each of them does not much exceed a mile 
in breadth ; the one lies between the Frith and the parifh of 
Dunfermline, and the other between Dunfermline and Dal- 
gety parifties. 

Town, Conjiitution of the Burgh, &amp;c— Inverkeithing is 
pleafantly fituated upon a rifing ground above the bay of the 
harbour ; it confifts of one ftreet, with another fmaller turn- 
ing off near the middle, befides fome wynds. It has many 
good gardens. It is a very ancient royal burgh. King Wil- 
liam, furnamed the Lyon, gave them the firft charter. Se- 
veral 



Statiftical Account 



veral Kings of Scotland granted them charters at different 
periods ; and King James the VI. by a charter, dated 4th 
May 1598, ratifies and confirms them all, and declares their 
rights and privileges, to extend from the water of Dovan to 
that of Leven, and as far north as Kinrofs. It it is laid to 
have been a very confiderable burgh, of large extent, populous, 
and paid to government great taxes. The fet of this burgh 
is uncommon in fome things. The provoft, the two bailies, 
the dean of guild, and treafurer, are annually elected by the 
counfellors and deacons of the trades. The counfellors arc 
chofen from among the burgefs inhabitants, the guildry, and 
even the members of the incorporated trades, who ftill retain 
a vote in their refpective incorporations. The five incorpo- 
rated trades elect their deacons yearly as their reprefenta- 
tives. The town council, including the magiftrates, cannot 
be under 20 ; but it is not limited to any number above it ; 
fo that the whole burgefs inhabitants might be made counfel- 
lors. What is very Angular, the counfellors continue in of- 
fice during life and refidence. There is a good town-houfe, 
built in the year 1770, containing, befides a prifon, fome con- 
venient rooms for holding the bailie-courts, the meetings of 
council, and public entertainments. The yearly revenue a- 
vnounts to 200 1. Sterling and upwards j many of their ex- 
tenfive rights and dues have been fold and difpofed of at 
different times. The ftreets were once lighted with lamps 
during the winter feafons ; but this has been difcontinued 
for a long time. The prefent magiftrates are very attentive 
and active in making improvements, and doing whatever is 
in their power for the advantage and convenience of the in- 
habitants. There are feveral markets or fairs in the year 
for horfes, cattle, and different kind of goods, fuch as 
coarfe linens, checks, fhoes, &amp;c. This burgh is reprefented

Many have arrived at advanced periods of life. There are

going about their ordinary bufinefs. There is a man living 
here, but moflly confined to his bed, whofe age, from au- 
thentic accounts, is 94 : He was by trade a gardener, and 
has had five wives. The annual average of births from the 
parifh records is about 50, and of marriages 15. There is 
no regifter of deaths kept here. The number of births and 
marriages cannot be exactly afcertained, as there are many 
diffenters from the eftablifhed church, who do not infert 
their names in the parifh regifter. The population has 
greatly increafed within thefe few years, owing to the flou- 
rifhing ftate of the coal trade brought from Halbeath and 
fhipped here, to a confiderable diftillery and brewery in the 
neighbourhood of the town, and a branch of the iron foun- 
dery bufinefs lately introduced. 

Proprietors

Stati/lical Account 



Proprietors and Value. — The parifh belongs to the Earls 
of Hopetoun and Morton, Sir William Erfkine and Sir John 
Henderfon, Mr Cunningham and a few {'mall heritors. The 
laft gentleman is the only one of any confequence refiding 
in it. The valued rent in the cefs books is 6956 1. 16 s. 8 d. 
Scots. The real rent amounts to near about 3000 1. Ster- 
ling, and upon new leafes would rife confiderably above it. 

Appearance, Soil, and Agriculture. — The parifh, in general, 
excepting the Ferry hills, and a few others, is either flat or 
gently rifing ground, the greateft part of which is ftrong, 
rich, or clay foil, and yields plentiful crops ; even among 
thefe hills many places are arable, and produce moderately 
good crops. Towards the extremity, upon the north, the 
foil is cold, and a fmall part is muir. Some of the farms are 
extenfive, and others of an ordinary fize. The farmers are, 
in general, wealthy, induftrious, and active : They improve 
and cultivate their lands to great perfection and advantage : 
They moftly ufe the new conftrucled ploughs, drawn by two 
good horfes without a driver : They manure and enrich their 
field with dung, lime, and earth, mixed together, with fea- 
weed, when they can obtain it, and by fummer fallow. From 
the goodnefs of the ground, and the moft proper mode and 
means of cultivation, they raife grain of all kinds, equal in 
quantity and quality to many parts in Scotland. The farms 
are not yet all inclofed and properly fenced ; but, from the 
difpofitign of the proprietors, and the improvements now car- 
rying on in that way, it is expected this will foon be the 
cafe. There is a fociety formed here, called the Farmer Club, 
the members of it belong alfo to moft of the neighbouring 
parifhes, and feveral gentlemen of landed property have 
joined and patronife it. The great object of it is to confider 
and improve the different modes of agriculture. At ftated 

meetings 



of lnvcrkcithing, 505 

meetings they have ploughing matches ; the competitors are 
their fervants, each man takes his ridge. When the work 
is done, it is examined by proper judges, and a fuitable pre- 
mium is given to the beft, and two or three more of the 
ploughmen. This practice has been attended with very be- 
neficial effects. 

Harbour, Shipping, and Ferry. — Before the entrance of the 
harbour, there is a large and fafe bay, which affords excel- 
lent flielter for fhips in all winds. Here his Majefty's (hips 
of war fometimes come from Leith roads, and ride at anchor 
to avoid the winter ftorm* ; and merchant fhips from the 
Mediterranean formerly ufed to perform quarantine here. 
The harbour itfelf is a fmall bay ; at the mouth of which, 
upon the weft fide, there lies a large Dutch built veffel as a 
lazaretto, where, inftead of detaining fhips from foreign 
ports, the particular goods, in which any infection may be 
fuppofed to lodge, are immediately received, aired under the 
infpection of a proper officer, and delivered, within a limited 
time, to the owners, by the exprefs orders of the cuftom- 
houfe. At the head of the bay is the quay, the proper place 
for landing and receiving goods. The depth of water at 
fpring tides is 13 and fometimes 15 feet. It was deepened 
within thefe few years ; and a narrow channel cut farther 
down to admit fhips up to it. This is kept pretty clear by 
the rivulet that runs through it at low tide. Another 
quay is now building, with great improvements, to accomo- 
date the (hipping. There are here fometimes between 40 
and 50 veflels from different places waiting for coals, efpe- 
cially in the winter feafon. Several fhips belqng to this 
place \ but none of any confiderable burden. Some of them 
fail to foreign ports, and the reft are chiefly employed in the 
coal and coafting trade. Between the North Ferry and Ro- 

Vol. X. 3 S fyth 



5 c6 Statiflical Account 

fyth Cnftle is St. Margaret's Bay or Hope, fo called from the 
l'nncefs of that name, afterwards Queen of Malcolm III. 
having in her flight from England landed there. On her 
account, the Ferry is called the Queensferry, being her con- 
stant paffage to and from her favourite refidence at Dunferm- 
line. This paffage is well known to every traveller ; the 
difiance is near two miles. All the boatmen refide in the 
North Ferry. There 2re four boats and four yawls employ- 
ed upon it ; thefe belong to certain proprietors of land on 
each fide of the Frith, who claim an exclufive right to the 
paffage, and for which the tackfmen, befides keeping thfr 
boats in repair, pay annually about 280 1. Sterling. The 
common freight is by far too low, being only a penny each 
paffenger. There are feveral landing places on each fide, 
and it is propofed to build more. r i hi* paffage is fafe and expe- 
ditious, and may be had at all times, excepting in a very few 
cafes ; and this only happens from high winds, together with 
particular and unfavourable times of the tide. There was 
a large boat overfet fome years ago, occafioned by a fudden 
fijuall, and its being fully loaded with black cattle; the boat- 
men were loft, and alfo the paffengers. Upon the welteru 
boundary of the pari ft, is a fmall harbour, called Bruce- 
haven ; fhips fometimes take in coals, but no other trade is 
carried on there. 

Mmufadures and Trade. — There is but little trade carried

the inhabitants with necefiary articles ; and there is a near and 
eafy acceis to Dunfermline and Edinburgh. This is a very 
convenient fituation for fhip-builders. Some time ago, they 
met with great encouragement, but at prefent there is little 
doing in that line. A confiderable w hi Iky diftillery is erect- 
ed here : It belongs to a Company, and is managed by one

of the partners. The fpirits are faid to be of a fine, and 
even fuperior quality ; they are fold at the common current 
prices ; and the fale of them is very extenfive. It feems to 
be in a profperous and flourilhing ftate. There is likewife 
a brewery, carried on to no great extent, and lerving chiaiy. 
for the confumpt of the inhabitants, there is a Company 
who import annually from the Baltic large quantities of 
wood •, they have extenlive and rapid fales, and are very 
fuccefsful in that trade. The coal ihipped here is by far 
the greateft article of trade. The coalliery is at Halbeath, in 
the parifh of Dunfermline : It once belonged to a Dnrch. 
Company; but, being attended with no advantage, they dif- 
pofed of it. It is now worked by a Company of our own 
countrymen, who carry it on with fpirit, and have brought 
it to a flourilhing ftate. There is a proper waggon road 
laid with timber, for the diftance of five miles, and kept in 
good repair at a great expence. Twenty-four waggons are 
employed ; they are drawn, fome by one and others by two 
horfes, and bring down two tons each time. The coals are 
c;ood, burn well, and have , great heat and force ; they are 
fold at 15 s. per waggon, the great coal ; and lis. 6 d. the 
chows or final! coal : The burgefs inhabitants buy them, by 
a particular agreement, at a cheaper rate. Twenty-five thou- 
fand tons and upwards are (hipped annually ; the demand is 
greater than can be anfwered ; and fliips frequently wait 5 
and 6 weeks. There are a few falt-pans that make annually 
from twelve to fifteen thoufand bufhels. An iron foundery 
was lately fct up. Several experienced workmen are em- 
ployed in it : They make beautiful chimney grates, waggon 
wheels, and all kind of caft iron work for machinery and 
houfe utenfils. This feems to be a convenient, and advanta- 
geous fituation ; the metal can be brought by fea ; it is near 
to coal ; and the manufactured goods can be tranfporrcd ve-

the property cf iSir John Hendtrfbn, Baronet, of I'ordel, and

Eccleftajiical State t SchxI t &amp;c. — Sir William Erfkinc, B i- 
ronet, of Torry, is the patron, having lately purchafed tlie 
eftate of S;enccr£ield, to which is annexed the right of pi- 
tronage. The church was repaired and partly rebuilt within 
thefe 20 years. It is Wge enough to contain the parifhioners. 
It is a little lingular in outward appearance, being covered 
with three roofs of equal dimenfions, which are fupportcd 
by two rows of arches within, and the two fide wails. It 
could eaGly be made a handfome, commodious, and elegant 
church. Upon the weft fide, adjoining to it, is the 
fteeple, which feems to be very ancient, from the appea- 
rance of the ftones and the form of the building. The 
ibpend at prefent confifts of 5 chalders victual, and 500. 
merks Scots, befides 4 1. Sterling, of what is called vicarage. 
The free teinds are confiderable : There has been no augmen- 
tation fincc the year 1636, and a procefs is now carrying on 
for that purpofe. There is no manfe or garden, but an al- 
lowance for houfe rent is paid by the town and fome of the 
heritors. A fmall houfe and garden at Rofyth goes by that 
name. There are two glebes and a fmall park by itfelf, mak- 
ing in all eight acres of excellent ground. The one is the 
glebe of Rofyth, which was annexed to this parifh, and lies 
adjacent to that old church now in ruins ; but it is propofed 
to have it exchanged and placed with the other, which is near 
the town. 

There

There is a tolerable fchoolhoufe, with a fufflcient garden. 
The prefent fchoolmafter *, who is a very good fcholar, has 
been here upward? of 40 years ; he draws an annual f'alary 
of 200 merks Scots, paid Dy the town and heritors. He is 
alfo precentor and feflion clerk, for which he receives 28 1. 
Scots, with the ordinary emoluments and dues belongirg to 
rhat office. He teaches, befides the common branches of 
education, the languages, navigation, and the other partr of 
mathematics. The number of fcholars is about 50, being 
commonly 40 in fummer and 6c in winter. There are feve- 
ral private teachers befides. The fchool wages are too low, 
and by no means adequate to the teachers abilities and la- 
bours; although as much as can be well afforded by the poor 
part cf the inhabitants. The number of poor receiving pub- 
lic charity, is not confiderable. Their funds were much dimi- 
nilhed by the failure of a perfon who had their money in his 
hands; and they now chiefly arife from the weekly collec- 
tions at the church doors, which at prefent anfwer the de- 
mands. 

Religious Perfupjiom. — Rather more than the half of the 
inhabitants in the town and parifh adhere to the eftablifhed 
church ; the reft are Burghers, Antiburgers, Relief, and 
Cameronians. A Burgher meeting houfe was built here about 
40 years ago, occafioned by the fettlement of the late incum- 
bent, who, it feems, though a moft worthy and refpectable 
character, was difagreeable to a great number of the parifh- 
ioners ; it is moftly attended by the loweft part of the peo- 
ple, and many of them come from the neighbouring pa- 
rimes. The Antiburghers and Relief are not numerous, 
and attend their meeting houfes in Dunfermline. The Ca- 
meronians,

meronians, in this piace, took their rife, a few years ago, 
from a difference among the Burghers, many of whom, 
along with their minifter, at that time, joined themlelves 
with this fed} : They have no proper meeting houfe, and 
are occafionally fupplied with (ermonsj though but fel- 
dom, by their itinerant preachers. It is remarkable, that all 
thefe differences arofe about church politics, they are main- 
tained and kept up with the fame fpirit and zeal, and the 
leaders of each feci: ufe the utmoft endeavours to retain their 
adherents and followers, which, among fuch a clafs of hearers, 
axe frequently attended with confiderable fuccefs. 

Eminent Men.—TK\s parifh has given birth to feveral per- 
fbns who have diltinguifhed themfelves in their profeffional 
line. Commodore Roxburgh, born in this town, was promo- 
ted to that rank in the Ruffian fervice, and was very active 
and attentive to its interefts before he quitted it. The fa- 
mous Admiral Greig was a native of this town, was educated 
under the prefent fchqplmafter, and went, at an early period 
of life, into the Britifh fervice. While in the navy of Great 
Britain, he diftinguifhed himlelf at the defeat of Conflans by 
Admiral Hawke, the taking of the Havannah, and feveral 
other engagements in that fuccefsful war. After the peace of 
1762, he entered into the Ruffian fervice; and there, at the 
battle of Chio, contributed principally, by his advice and ex- 
ertions, to the deftruclion of the whole Turkim fleet. Senfi- 
ble of his great profeffional merit, her Imperial Majefly pro- 
moted him (though a foreigner) to the chief command of the 
Ruffian navy, which he raifed to a degree of refpeftability 
and importance it never before had attained. In reward of 
his great fervices, the Emprefs beftowed on him many ho- 
nourable marks of diftinction, and an eftate in Livonia which 
his family now enjoy. In the laft war, between the Ruffians 

and

and Turks, which laft were joined by the Swedes, he, in the 
Baltic, defeated the Swedifh fleet, and had not a part of his 
fquadronj through cowardice, refufed to come into a&amp;ion, he 
probably had captured or funk the moft of them. Soon after 
this, he was feized with a fever, and died at Revel, on the 
26th Odober 1788. He was no lefs illuftrious for courage 
and naval lkill, than for piety, benevolence, and every pri- 
vate, virtue **

* Antiquities. — Upon the top of Lethem hill, there are fome 
large Hones, placed in a circular form, faid to have been a Drui- 
dical temple. King David the I. frequently relided in this place. 
Some perfons remember to have feen the ruins of a houfe at the 
north end of the town, which commonly went by the name of 
King David's Houfe, but there remains not the fmalleft veftige. 
At the North Ferry, there are the ruins of a chapel, which was 
Jiberally endowed by King Robert the 1. and ferved by the 
Monks of Dunfermline. The Francifcans and the Dominicans, 
cr the black and grey Friars, had both of them convents in this 
town. There is a houfe called the Inns, which ftill has pecu- 
liar privileges and exemptions, not being within the jurifdiclion 
of the magiftrates, and appears to have been one of them, from 
its form, vaults, high garden walls, and other buildings. To- 
wards the north part of the parifh, there is a flone fet up about 
10 feet high, 2i broad, and 1 thick, commonly called the (land- 
ing ftone. Many rude figures leems to have been cut upon it, 
but are much defaced by the weather and length of time ; how- 
ever, two armed men on horfeback, the one behind the other, 
appear pretty difcemible on the eaft fide. It is fuppofed, thap 
after fome battle between the Scots and Danes, fought near this 
place, fome Dane of diftintfion had fallen, and been buried there, 
and this ftone, as was then very commonly done, raifed as a. 
monument over his grave. In this parifh is the caftle of Ro- 
fyth, almoll oppofite to Hopeton Houfe; it is built upon rock, 
and furrounded by the fea at full tide ; it confilts of a large 
fquare tower, and fome low ruinous walls adjoining to it, buC 
there is the appearance of larger and more extended buildings. 
It cannot now be afcertained by whom it was built, or at what 
time. Above a door, upon the north fide, there is a coat of 
arms with a crofs, a crdwn, &amp;c. and M. R. 1561. Upon the 
ftone bars of windows in the fquare tower, there is T. * S. and

This cafile was the ancient feat of the Stuarts of Rofyth, lineal- 
ly defcended from James Stuart, brother german to Walter the 
great Stuart of Scotland, and father to King Robert. The lad 
laird of that name, having no near relations, difpofed of the 
eftate to a ilranger ; it afterwards became the poiTeflion of Lord 
Rofeberry ; and is now the property of the Earl of Hopeton. 
There is a tradition, however unfounded it may be, that Oli- 
ver Cromwell's mother, being a daughter of the family of Stu- 
art of Rofyth, was born in this caftle, and that the proteclor 
vifited it, during the time he commanded the army in Scotland. 
It is faid, there is a record in the Advocate's Library at Edin-

candidate It is much to be lamented, that religion is made 
fublervient to thefe purpofes, and the fettlement of its minif- 
ters connected with the politics and the factions of the burgh. 
Here the inhabitants have fupported or oppofed, according as 
the promotion of the perfon Was fuitable or inimical to their 
political views ; and they now fhnd diftinguifhed in the records 
of the church, for two fucceffive oppofitions, in the laft of 
which, and that but lately, many of the people declared 
againft their political leaders, and would no longer obey their 
unreafonable and unchriftian orders. However, upon the 
whole, the people, with a few exceptions, are religious and 
devout, peaceable and ufeful members of Ibciety, and attached 
to their king and country, its civil conftitution, and its mild, 
equitable, and falutary laws. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The fituation of this parifh is 
healthy and chearful : There are no difeafes peculiar to it, the 
fmall-pox raged laft fummer with great violence, and car- 
ried off great numbers of children. Inoculation is much ne- 
glected by the lower fort of the people, and many of them 
have an inluperable prejudice and averfion againft the practice 
of it. Provifions of all kinds are good and plenty, but fome 
of them dearer than in Edinburgh. The roads are well 
made : There is a toll bar, a mile from the North Ferry, the 
produce of which, with the commuted ftatute labour, keeps 
them in good repair. Near the North Ferry, there are large 
quarries ; the ftone is very hard and durable, and generally dug 
out in perpendicular rows. Some time ago great quantities 
were prepared and fhipped, to pave the ftreets of London, 
but none has been carried there for lbme years. The 
Frith gradually contracts from Kinghorn; here the fhore, 
which is high and rocky, fuddenly ftretches out towards the 
fouth, and brings it within a narrow compafs. The water 
is deep, and the tides rapid, owing to the widenefs and length

c£ the Frith above. There was a battery eretted, upon this 
point of land to the eaft of the Ferry, after Paul Jones ap- 
peared, with his fmall fquadron, and alarmed the coafts. 
There is a higher and a lower battery, mounting, together, 
8 iron guns, 20 pounders, and 8 field pieces. In the mid- 
dle of the Fritn, and right oppolite, Hands Inch-Garvie, the 
Old fortifications of which were repaired at that time ; and 
4 iron guns, 20 pounders, mounted upon them. Each gun has 
100 rounds of amunition. One man belonging to the corps 
of artillery lives here, to notice the works, and take care of 
the ftores. There is no account of any remarkable battle 
within the parifh. There was a fmali fkirmifh upon the Ferry 
hills, between the Scots and Englifh in Oliver CromwelPs 
fime. The great and fevere engagement upon the following 
day, which was maintained with fo much obftinacy and flaugh- 
tcr on both fides, and terminated in the defeat of the Scots, 
was indeed begun near this town, upon a place called Hill- 
field j but the Scots retreating, it was chiefly fought upon 
the oppofite bank of Mafterton, which, though not far dif- 
tant, lies in the parifh of Dunfermline. Upon the top of 
the Ferry hills the prolpeet is beautiful, extenfive, and pic- 
turesque to the higheft degree. There is a View from the 
Ifland of May to Stirling, and far beyond it, of a rich country 
diverfified with towns, villages, caftles, and noblemen's and 
gentlemen's feats, and bounded by the diftant hills, with nume-

perhaps one of the mod handfome and elegant in Europe.

#* The following additional particulars were received fincc 
the preceding account went to the prefs. 

In the grounds of Caftland Hill the property of the Eari 
of Morton, a lead mine was accidentally difcovered about 
30 years ago. The ore is faid to have been of an extraor- 
dinary fine quality. The ftratum was found to be very irre- 
gular, and of unequal thicknefs. After being wrought for 
fome time, it totally disappeared. A confiderable fum was 
expended, and the working of it attended with fome lofs* 
It is, however, thought, that there is plenty of lead ore ia 
thefe lands, and that it might be wrought out to great ad- 
vantage. 

In the beginning of laft winter, a coniiderable fhoal of 
herrings came into this bay ; and, about the North Ferry, 
they were caught in great quantities, and the fifhing conti- 
nued for a long time. In the beginning of this winter, there 
came a ftill greater fhoal, extending ali the way from Inch- 
Comb to Inch-Garvie. A great number of boats, from the 
eaft coafts of Fife, well manned, and fupplied with proper 
nets, are now employed in this herring fifhing, and meet 
with ample fuccefs. The herrings are pretty large, and very 
good, They are fold at different prices, and fometimes fo 
very low as 6 d. per hundred. They are carried to Edin- 
burgh, and many other places, in a frefh ftate. Some mer- 
chants have fent up feveral veffels to take them in, properly 
faked in barrels ; and, it is faid, propofe to fend them to the 
London and foreign markets. They ftill continue * in the 
greater!: plenty, and may probably do fo during a great part 
of the winter feafon. Some young whales, one of which has 
been caught, difturb the fifhing, and fometimes deftroy the 
nets.

NUMBER XXXV. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1012490">CAMPBELTON</name>. 

(County and Synod of Jrgyll.—Pre/bytery of Kintyre.J 
By the Reverend Dr John Smith, Mimjler.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE parilh of Campbelton is the feat of the prefbytery 
of Kintyre, which is fometimes, but improperly, fpclt 
Cantyre. The name of the parifti is not older than the be- 
ginning of the prefcnt century, when the town, which makes 
a part of it, was created a burgh, and called Campbelton, 
from the family name of the Duke of Argyll, the principal 
proprietor of the town and neighbourhood. For fome time 
before that period, it went by the name of Ceann-loch % ( Loch- 
head J, which it ftill retains in the language of the country, 
and' fometimes by the name of Ki/kerran, one of the four an- 
sient parifhes united in the laft century into one. But the 
oldeft name ot Campbelton, by which a part of it is ftill 
known, is Dairuadhain, from its having been the capital of 
the accent Scottilh or Dalreudinian kingdom, as will after- 
wards be noticed. 

Extent. — The parifti of Campbelton confifts of a large fec- 
iien of the peninfula of Kintyre. Its length, from north to 

foutb, 



Stati/lical Account 



fouth, is computed * to be 1 1 miles ; its breadth at the north 
end about 6, and at the fouth end about 10. It is narrowed 
about the middle, where the two feas verge towards one ano- 
ther ; the bay of M^chir-hanith running in, a confiderable 
way on the one fide, and the loch of Kilkerran, or harbour 
of Campbelton, on the other. The fpace between the two 
is occupied by a large plain, of about 4 miles in length and 3 
in breadth, and not above 40 feet above the level of the fea. 

Soil. — This plain confifts partly of fand covered with bent, 
and a thin but fine pile of grafs ; partly of arable and marfh, 
of which fome has been drained ; but principally of mofs, 
fome of which has been, and more may yet be, improved. 
Both ends of the parifh, to the north and fouth of this flat, 
are hilly, rifing gradually to 1000 or 1200 feet above the 
level of the fea. The fkirts of the hills, and fome valleys 
near their fummits, are cultivated ; but the furface is in ge- 
neral covered with heath. The foil is of various kinds, deep 
or (hallow, according to its altitude or declenfion, and much 
of it wet or fpouty. In general, however, the arable land 
is light and warm, and, when compared with other parts of 
the Highlands, may be called fertile. 

Climate and Difeafes. — The climate is mild, but the air is 
often moift. We have frequent rains, little froft, and fel- 
dom any fnow. The froft is not often fo intenfe as to fink the 
thermometer 8 degrees below Fahrenheit's freezing point. 
The people have few difeafes, except the rheumatifm, which 
is afcribed to the moifture of the atmofphere, and putrid 
fevers, which often vifit the inhabitants in fpring, in com- 
mon

furveyor to the Duke of Argyll.

rcon with other parts of the Highlands ; owing, no doubt, to 
the poor manner, in which the greater part of the inhabitants 
live, during the winter leafon. Confumptions too, and afth- 
matic complaints, are not unfrequent ; and it is to be feared, 
that we muft foon be compelled to invent a name in Gaelic 
for the palfy. Were the people able to pay more attention 
to their drefs, their diet, and their dwellings, their ailments 
would probably decreafe, as their conftitutions are generally 
good, and the climate abundantly healthy. 

Civil Hi/lory *. — This country, like the reft of Britain, was 
peopled at firft by the Celtic tribes. But as one wave im- 
pels another, fo fucceeding hords feem to have driven the 
firft fettlers in this ifland, to Ireland and the adjacent ifles, till 
a fuperabundance of population there, made them recoil on 
the tribes whom they had left behind them. 

The earlieft claffical mention of this country is to be found 
in Ptolomy, who feems to have confidered the peninfula of 
Kintyre and Knapdale, as united to the iflands of Hay and 
Jura ; forming the territory, which he calls Epidium. proba- 
bly from a fimilar Celtic word, which fignifies the ijle of the 
Pifis ; for, at that time, the Pitts were the principal inhabi- 
tants of thofe parts, where they remained till the year 210 
of the Chriftian aera ; when, in their turn, they were driven 
in confiderable numbers to Ireland, as we learn from the 
Piailh Chronicle. 

Some time after, (according to Father Innes and others, 
in the year 258,) a large colony of the ancient Celtic inhabi- 
tants

tanrs returned from Ireland, during the commotions whicri 
took place in that country, under the reign of Cormac 
O'Cuin, and effected a fettlement in the fouthern parts of 
the Pi&amp;ifh dominions, from which they had formerly been 
expelled ; namely, in Kintyre and Argyll *. This colony 
was conducted by Reuda, (as Bede calls him) or Cairbre 
Ruadh, fon of Conar II. King of Ireland, as he is ftiled in 
the Irifh annals, and in the ancient poems, which celebrate 
his valour. The family of Fingal, who had eftablifhed their 
little kingdom in the inland diftrict, which Mill retains the 
name of Morven, feem to have difputed the fovereignty of 
the country with Cairbre or Cairbar. But the death of Of- 
car, the fon of Offian, who fell by the hands of Cairbar f, 
decided the difpute in favour of the latter. From this, Cair- 
bre Ruadh, or Red-haired Cairbar^ Kintyre and the adjacent 
country got, and long retained, the name of Dal-ruaidh or 
the portion of Ruadh ; and hence the people got the name of 
Dalruaidhiniy which was foftened or corrupted by the wri- 
ters of the Latin into Dalreudd, Dalriadd, and Dalreudini. 

The fame people are, by Ammianus Marcellinus, by the 
author of the Notitia Imperii, and by other writers of the 
4th and 5th centuries, called Scotti and Atacotti ; the firft, 
an appellation which they carried with them from Ire- 
land, the Scotia or Scotland of that period •, the latter, proba- 
bly given them by the Romans, from hearing their country 
called Atafcotti, the place or territory of the Scots. 

About the middle of the 5th century, (according to Gildas 
in 446,) the Scots were again driven back to Ireland, where 
thev remained till 503, when they returned under the con-

they had all got the benediction of St. Patrick, who died in 
442. Angus fee.ns to have died foon after his arrival in this 
country, for we hear no more uf him. In the divilion of 
the country, Hay probably fell to his fhare ; as, afrer his 
death, we find it poiTcfl'ed by his fon Murdach, whofe wi. 
dow Lrca, the daughter of Lorn, was afterwards married 
to his coulin-german, the fon of Conal of Ireland, to whom 
fhe bore Felim, the father of bt. Columba, the Apoftlc of 
the Highlands. 

Of the main land, Lorn took the northern diviflon, which 
£1 ill retains his name ; and Fergus the fouthern, or Kintyre 
and Argyll. Lorn dying in a fhort time, Fergus added his 
brother's territory to his own, and fo became fole monarch 
of the Scots or Dairuaidhini ; and he has flood ever fince at 
the head of our hit of Scottdh Kings. From the Irifh fea, 
his territory extended northward to Drumalbin, or Tyn- 
drum ; and was bounded on the eail by the kingdom of the 
Britons or Strath-Clyde, whofe capital (while the kingdom 
cxiftedj was A cluith or Balclutha, now Dumbarton, a cor- 
ruption ot Dun-Briton. On the north it was bounded by 
the kingdom of the PiSts, whofe capital at that time was 
Invernels. 

As the Dalreudinian Kings of the line of Fergus, had, for 
fome centuries, their refidence in this parifh, where they were 
furrounded by the moft fertile tract they were poffefTed of, 
and where they had the fafeft and moft commodious harbour, 
in their whole territory, for their fleet, it may perhaps be ex- 
pected, in a hiftory of this parifh, that fome brief account 
fhouid be given of them ; and that fo many Kings fhould not

be pafled over in filence, when the title of King is fo juftly 
refpecled and beloved. Bcfidfe's, although thefe Kings lived 
in Dalruadhain; or C;impbdton, yet their hiitory claims, in a 
particular manner, the reader's attention ; as it is, in facl, the 
hiftory of the Scottilh kingdom in general, of which this pa- 
rifh was the cradle. 

Fe rgus, as already mentioned, began his reign in con* 
junction with Lorn, and probably with Angus, in 503. lit 
a few years, he was fucceeded by his fon Domangard, who, 
in 4 or 5 years, left the kingdom to Congal, one of his fons 
by Fedelina, daughter of Brian M'Achy, King of Ireland. 
After a long reign, his brother Gauran fucceeded him, ac- 
cording to the annals of UKler, in 544, and lived till 560, 
when his nephew, Conal I. afcended the throne, and reigned 
till 575» a year fatal alfo to his fon Doncha, who fell in the 
battle of Loro in Kintyre, in which he contended with his 
coufin Aidan, the Son of Gauran, for the fucceffion to the 
kingdom. 

The fortune of the day gave it in favour of Aidan, (or 
Acdhan M ( Gaurar: } as he is called in our tales *). Of all the 

Dal- 

* It is remarkable that, in fo rude an age, Aidan was not 
fatisfieu with the title which he had got to the kingdom by the 
fword, without being alfo anointed by dt. Columba. The 
faint, who had more favour for his brother Eogban, delayed, for 
a coniiderable time, the cerernpny of tne unclion, till, at length, 
for two or three nights fucceffively, a fuptrnatural agent, it is

his office ; and, as he ftill delayed, he gave him at lall a blow 
on the fide, of which he retained the matk eyer after; adding, 
at the fame time, a menace of repeating the correction if he 
fhould put off the bulinefs any longer. The faint, it fhould 
feem, did not chufe to run the hazard of having the threaten- 
ing executed He anointed Aidan King, and zealoufly fup- 
ported his interelt ever after ; for when Aidan was to fight a 
battle, the monks of Jona were convened to pray for his fuc- 
cefs.

Dalruadhain Kings, Aidan was the moft renowned. He 
carried his victorious arms from Ireland, where he fought 
many battles, to the Hie of Man, where he alio conquered ; 
and at length to Northumberland, where, however, his for- 
mer good fortune failed him. In 605 he died ; and was bu- 
ried, according to Fordun, in Kilkerran, the burying place of 
this parifh. 

Of Aidan's many fons, the greater part feem to have fal- 
len the victims of his battles. Accordingly, one of the 
youngeft of them, Eochan Bui ', (yellow haired Heeler) was 
his fucceflbr ; who, after a reign of 16 or 17 years, left the 
throne to Conchar Ciar, the fon of Conal, who had already 
given many proofs of his valour in fighting againtt the Picts 
and Irifh. In 622, he was fucceeded by his fon Ferchar I. 
who left the throne to Donal Brec, fon of £achan Bui', and 
grandfon of Aidan. This prince was often in the field, but 
feldom or never victorious. In the battle of Moy.roth in 
Ireland, (in the year 637) he was defeated with great lofs ; 
and the next year had the fame bad fortune in the battle of 
Glen-murelan. In 642, he was killed at Fraith-C.irven, as 
he fought with Hoan, King of the B itons. 

The Dalruadhain, or Scottifh kingdom, greatly weakened 
by the wars and bad fortune of Donal Brec, puffed afterwards 
through the hands of Conal II. Dugal, Uonal II. and 
Malduine, defcendants of Eachan Bui' ; but in that declin- 
ing ftate, which is fo bitterly lamented by Adomnan, towards 
the end of the 7th century. 

Accordingly the houle of Lorn, whofe claims lay dormant 
for many generations, found now a favourable opportunity 
of difputing with the houfe of Fergus the right to the throne, 
and of beginning thole wars which, with various fuccefs, 
ferved for a long time to weaken both houfes, and, of courfe, 
to hurt the general interelts of the kingdom. 

According 



Statijlical Account 



According to the genealogy of the book of Lecan, Ferchstr 
Fada, the fucceffor of Malduine, was of the houfe of Lorn. 
But his fucceflbr, Achy Rineval, grandibn of Donal Brec, 
was of the Fergufian or Cantirian line, and held the unfteady 
fceptre only 2 or 3 years, when it was feized by Jinchellach, 
fon of Ferchar Fada. But he had fcarce. got hold of it, 
when it was wrefted from him by his own brother Selvac, 
who feized the King, (after having burned his palace of Dun- 
olly) and fent him in chains to Ireland. From thence he 
returned ; after 12 years, with fome afllftance which he had 
procured, and, in attempting to recover his kingdom, fell in 
the battle of Finglirn, a fmall valley in the mountains of 
Lorn. 

Thefe domeftic quarrels of the houfe of Lorn, gave the 
family of Fergus fome time to recover. Accordingly, we 
find in the fame year (718), Doncha Beg, (or Little Duncan) 
who is (tiled only King of Kintyre, difputing the fovereignty 
with Selvac, and defeating him in a defpcrate fea engage- 
ment ; which was fought off Ardineffe, a cape or promontory 
of Argyll, that lias now loft its ancient name. Doncha 
died in 720, but Achy, (probably his fon,) and the grand- 
fon of Donal Duine, continued the conteft with Selvac for 
5 or 6 years longer; till, in 726, he prevailed fo far as to ob- 
tain a divilion of the diftrict of Argyll, which lay between Kin- 
tyre and Lorn, and was often the fubjt ct cf contention, when 
neither houfe could entirely fubdue the other. In 729, Sel- 
vac died, and Achy fucceeded, as it would feem, to the whole 
kingdom, for he is ftiled, by Tighearnach, Rex Da/riadd, or 
King of Dalruaidh. After his death, which is placed in 
733, the fucceffion is not clear. The two houfes, as for- 
merly in the cafe of Fergus and Lorn, and,lately of Selvac and 
Duncan, feem, at times, to have had feparate Kings * and, by 
that means, to have occafioned fome confufion in the lift of 

our

our Scottifh fovereigns, which, an author in a remote cor- 
ner, with few books to confult on the fubject, may not per- 
haps be able entirely to remove. Upon the death of Achy, 
Murdach, the fon of Anchellach, according to the annals 
of Tighearnach, affumed the kingdom of Lorn *, at a time 
when it would feem, from the annals of Ulfter, that Dun- 
king, brother of Achy, (and another fon of Doncha Beg) 
afcended the throne of Kmtyre. The death of this prince 
is placed in 746, when he was fucceeded by Aodh Fionn, or 
Aidan the fair, (fon of his brother Achy) remarkable for his 
long reign of 30 years. The end of this period will bring 
us down to 776, which begins the reign of Fergus, another 
fon of Achy, whofe death is marked, in the annals of Ulfter, 
under the year 780. 

To Fergus lucceeded Donchorcai, who died in 791, bear- 
ing, like Fergus, the title of King of Dalruaidh. The Co- 
nal, who ftands next in the ordinary lift, is probably the fon 
of Ao , ain y (or Aodh, above mentioned) whofe death the an- 
nals of Ulfter place in 806, when he was probably fucceed- 
ed by Angus, (fon of Dunlaing) who died in 811. 

Between Angus and Alpine three other kings intervene, 
Aodh, Eoghanan^ and Dughal ; and although fome queftions

t^t' 735) Ungult, King of the Picls, committed great devalua- 
tion in his territories. He took Dunath, burned Creich, and 
put the fans of Selvac in ch.iins, as their father had formerly 
treated his own brother. He alio repeated his hoftile vilit foon 
after, and crulhed the houfe of Lorn to fuch a degree, that it 
never afterwards recoveitd. Stiil, however, it had fome who 
claimed, occalionally, the title of King ; of whom were pro- 
bably Donald, one of the Conals, and that Conftantine, who 
appears in the lift of our Scouifh Kings. He was probably 
the lad of thofe who ventured, in 799, to engage in a fkirmifh 
with the houfe of Kintyre, in which Fiangalach, fon of Dun- 
laing, was killed.

have arifen about their genealogy, as well as that of their 
fuccefibr Alpine, yet if we confider the declining ftate of the 
houfe of Lorn, and the growing power of that of Kintyre, 
which, ever fince the reign of Doncha Be^, extended the 
fceptre generally over all Dalruaidh, no reafonable doubt can 
remain, in which houfe the crown would continue permanent- 
ly fixed. Even before the Picls had reduced the power of 
Lorn, the houfe of Fergus had become fo powerful, and had 
left fuch inconfiderable territories to that of Lorn, that it 
muft have been foon annihilated, without the help of a fo- 
reign invafion. 

As Alpine and Kenneth could not be of the houfe of Lorn, 
it is ftill lefs probable that they fhould, as a late writer * fup- 
pofes, be defcended from the Picts, and become fovereigns by 
right of conqueft. The Picls, about this time, though able 
to diftrefs the feeble and exhaufted power of Lorn, were by 
no means in condition to contend with the houfe of Fergus, 
then at the height of its power, lnftead of extending their 
territories and making conquefts, the Picls were by this time 
greatly reduced, and rapidly declining. From the annals of 
Ulfter it appears, that they were about this period not only 
harrafTed by foreign enemies, but miferably torn by inteftine 
feuds In 710, they fufFered a great flaughter, in a battle 
which they fought with the Saxons ; and in the fame year 
were worfted in another by the Dalruaidhins. In 716, we 
find them agdn engaged with the Dalruaidhins, and again 
worfted. In 727 they are at war among themfelves, and 
great numbers of the;ii flain ; and in the fame year another 
" lacrimabile bcllum," or doleful engagement, of the fame 
kind occurs. Next year (^28) we find their country involv- 
ed in another war, in which their king is flain. In 730, they 

are

arc engaged with the Dalruaidhins, and worfted. In 749, 
they are engaged with the Britons, and Talorgan their leader 
killed. In 788, a moft dreadful flaughter of them is made 
by the Norwegians. When reduced to this low ebb, inftead 
of conquering, they afforded a favourable opportunity for be- 
ing conquered. Accordingly Kenneth, at this "very juncture, 
rulhed down from his hills, with his hardy mountaineers, and 
feized their poffeffions on the eaftern coaft, which feem to 
have been fo greatly depopulated, by the repeated calamities 
already mentioned, that from this period the Picts ceafed to 
be a people, and their very language funk into oblivion. All 
our chronicles agree in this conqueft of Kenneth, who in 843 
tranflated his throne from Dalruadhain (or Campbelton) to 
Fortren, or Forteviot, whither, in the local hiftory of the pa- 
rilh ol Campbelton, it is not neceflary to follow him. 

After Kenneth had thus removed the feat of his govern- 
ment, from the weftern to the eaftern coaft of Scotland, this 
remote and deferted corner foon became a prey to foreign in- 
vaders. The Danes and Norwegians, who, fince the year 
795 made frequent dcfcents on the weftern ifles, had now- 
got firm poffeffion of the greater part of them. Nor were 
they fatisfied with this, but in a fhort time made fuch fre- 
quent inroads into the heart or the kingdom, as to put it en- 
tirely out of the fovereign's power, to pay any attention to the 
frontiers. Kintyre being a peninfula, fuffered the fame fate 
with the ifiands : Both were the afylum of pirates, who not 
only infefted thefe and the adjacent parts, but frequently re- 
turned to commit depredations on the kingdoms from which 
they came. At length Harold Harfager, King of Den- 
mark, about the end of the ninth century, found it neceffary to 
make an expedition to this country in perfon, for the purpofe 
of reducing them to obedience, and appointing a viceroy or 

gover- 



528 



Statijlical Account 



governor over them ; for, as thefe iflands were chiefly in- 
habited by his f'ubjecls, he began to conlider them as a part 
of his kingdom. 

His lieutenant, Ketil, was the perfon inverted by Harold 
with the government of the ifles ; but KetiFs ambition was 
flill higher than his ftation. He formed alliances with the 
people, fet up for independence, and fixed the leat of his lit- 
tle kingdom in the Ifle of Man, where he and his lucceflbrs 
for feveral generations were fometimes independent, and at o- 
thcr times tributary, according to the viciflitudes of their af- 
fairs. 

With one of thefe kings or viceroys, So M erl e d, a power- 
ful chieftain of Kintyre, formed a matrimonial alliance ab ut 
the beginning of the 12th century*, and fome time ,'fcr 
this (in 1 158) availing him f elf of the troubles of that aera, 
and of a fleet of 53 fail, fet up for an independent prince, 
and tore the weftern ifles and Kintyre from the crown of 
Mann. After this, by conqueft or treaty, he made himfelf 
mafter of Lorn and Argyll, which, with the ifl nJ of Mull, 
and thofe to the north of it, he gave to his Ion Dugal, ab he 
did Kintyre and the ifles to the louth of it, to his otner lbn 
Reginald. 

Somerled, not yet fatisfied with the extent of his poflef- 
iions, and elated with the fuccels which had hitherto atten- 
ded his arms, formed the defign, if we may oelieve the Chro- 
nicle of Mann, of fubjecting to himfelf all Scotland. That 
his views were of that afpiring nature, appears highly proba- 
ble, from his having begun the war, and carried his arms to 
fo diftant a part of the kingdom. In the year 1164, with a 

fleet

Picet of 120 fail, he made a defcent on the Clyde, and fought 
with the army of Malcolm IV. near Renfrew; but he there 
fell, in the midft of a great number of his followers, a fa- 
crifice to his ambition. 

The effects of this difafter were long felt by the fimily of 
Somerled, who, inftead of attempting to make conquefts, for 
fome generations after, were hardly able to preferve the ter- 
ritories of their father. Accordingly, we find the kings of 
Norway, of Scotland, and fomttimes of England, laying 
claim, at different periods, to the fovereignty of the ifles, and 
pretending to difpofe of them at their pleafure ; although the 
defendants of Somerled, whofe chief refidence was at 
Campbelton, ftill kept the poffefiion, exercifed the power, 
and often affumed the title of kings. Frequently, however, 
they were obliged to temporife, and to attach themfclvcs to 
different powers, as prudence or policy directed. Thus, in 
1206, we find Reginald an independent prince. In 1212, 
we find him fwear fealty to king John of England. Soon 
after, his fuccciTor declares himfelf the vaflal of Alexander 
II. of Scotland, and gives liberal donations to the monks of 
Paifley, partly on condition of their praying for the foul of 
the king his mafter. After that, we find his dominions tri- 
butary to Norway, till Hacho loft the battle of the Largs in 
1263 ; after which his Norwegian fucceffbrs yielded them to 
the crown of Scotland, for the annual tribute of 100 marks, 
as Donald Baine king of Scotland had formerly, in 1093, 
given them up to Magnus the Barefooted, as the price of his 
friendffiip, or as a bribe to avert his hoftility *. 
Vol. X. 3 X In 

* It has been already obferved, that Kintyre always fhared 
the fame fate with the ifles. On this occafion Magnus, in order 
to bring it within the compafs of his grant, had his barge drawn 
under fail over the ifthmus of Tarbet f After which, confider- 
ing the power of his fword, nobody could be found fo hardy as 
to deny that Kintyre was an ifland.

In 1335, the defendants of Somerled were again indepen- 
dent. In 1405 and 1408, Henry IV. of England, by his 
ambaffador, courted the alliance of the two brothers, Donald, 
anceltor of the Macdonald family, and John, of the Antrim. 
Donald was poffeffed of the ifle?, and the neighbouring con- 
tinent. John inherited Kintyre, which he held of his elder 
brother. Donald having married Margaret, the eldeft fifter 
of Alexander L'flie Earl of Rofs, whofe daughter had taken 
the veil ; on the death of Alexander he acquired a right to 
his title and eft-ate. But the Duke of Albany, who acted as 
regent during the captivity of James I. of Scotland, having 
married a younger fifter of the Earl's, pretended alfo to his 
fucce.ffion. The Duke had been guardian to the nun his 
niece, who. though rendered incapable, by her pious teclu- 
{ion, either to inherit, or to execute any deed valid in law, 
was fummoned by him to appear at a Parliament held at Stir- 
ling, that fhe might refign in form the earldoms, for a new 
jnfeftment to his Ion the Earl of Buchan, afterwards killed 
at Verneuil. Donald oppofed the Duke of Albany by force 
of arms ; and a battle was fought, anno 1410, at Harlaw in 
Aberdeenfhire, between the contending parties, the iftue of 
which was not fo favourable as to fecure htm pofleflion. 

The king being afterwards convinced, that the regent's pre- 
tenfions were ill founded, or jealous of his aggrsndifement 
and power, without attempting to feize on Donald's lordfhip 
of the ifles, or imputing to him, as a crime of rebellion, the 
aflertion of his right, granted livery of the earldom of Rofs 
to Alexander his fon, who, in the reign of James II. was 
perhaps the moft powerful fubject in the kingdom ; being 
Earl of Rofs, Lord of the Ifles, and Jufticiary of Scotland, 
from the river Forth to Caithnefs. His fon John, the laft 
Earl of Rofs of the Somerled, or Macdonald, family, formed 
an alliance with Edward IV, of England, and became bound 



of Campbeltom 



to aid that monarch, in refitting the pretentions of Henry VI. 
and Margaret of Anjou*. The king of Scotland, offended 
at this daring and independent conduct of the Earl, fent an 
army under the command of the Earl of Athole, to reduce 
him to obedience +. But a reconciliation having, in the 
mean time, taken place between James and Edward, the Earl 
of Rofs fubmitted without refiftance. He was afterwards at- 
tainted by a parliament held at Edinburgh in the month of 
November 1475, but reftored the year following to the pof- 
feffion of Kintyre, Knapdale, Morven,and the lordfhip of the 
Ifles, " et omnes alias infu/as, quae fibi Joanni ante diB. forts -

Hugh of Slate in the ifle of Sky, brother to the laft Earl of

In regard to the fecond branch of the Macdonalds, it is 
to be obferved, that in the year 1493 J amcs IV". held a par- 
liament in Kintyre, where he emancipated part of the vaffals 
of the Macdonalds in Argyll, and granted them, de novo, 
charters holding of the Crown j and, in 1536, to curb the 
licenfe, and to fubdue the haughty fpirit of the chieftains and

ther fortified the caflle of Kilkerran, and left in it a garrifon 
io overawe Macdonald of Kintyre, whofe caftle of Duniveg 
flood within half a mile of the King's. But the daring 
chieftain and his followers were not to be thus intimidated. 
Before the King had got clear of the harbour, they added in- 
fult to rebellion, took the caflle, and hung the governor from 
the wall, as a fignal of their conqueft. 

As the troubles of the times, and the impotence of govern- 
ment, allowed the Macdonalds of Kintyre to commit thefe 
outrages with impunity, they continued in the fame courfe, 
defpifing the authority of their fovereign, till at length the 
laft miferable expedient of a weak government was adopted, 
that of commiffioning one tribe to chaftife and fubdue an- 
other. With that view, the lordfhip of Kintyre, then in the 
poflefHon of Sir James Macdonald, was granted to the fami- 
ly of Argyll, who, after many a ftruggle, at laft fucceeded in 
bringing the Macdonalds to order. The Revolution in 1688, 
gave fuch ftrength and vigour to government, as to make 
its influence extend to thofe diftant corners of the kingdom. 
In 1748 the jurifdidYion act diverted all the chieftains of the 
power of life and death, and gave the Highland fubject 
his chance of a (hare in that liberty, which is the peculiar 
boaft and blefllng of the natives of this ifle. 

Since that period, the nature of civil liberty is undoubtedly 
better known in the Highlands, and property is much more fc- 
cure. Yet we are not tofuppofe that the Macdonalds, or their 
predeceflbrs, the fierce fovereigns of this country, ever fported 
wantonly with the lives of their fubjects, otherwife than by 
cxpofing them to the calamities of war •, and in this refpecl it 
is hardly necefiary to remark, that the politeft people of our 
own times will match them. 

It is but juflice to fay of the M'Donalds, that they were 
probably no worfc than the times required. A rough peo ile 

had 



of Cam^helton. 533 

had need of rough lords ; and as, in the courfe of ages, the 
influence of no regular government reached thefe remote 
corners, which the Scottifh fovereigns had totally abandoned, 
the Macdonalds, who made annual circuits to receive and to 
fpend their revenues, to adminifler juftice, and to enforce a 
few Ample laws, were, in many refpecl?, ufeful to their peo- 
ple, and of Icrvice to fociety. 

On this account it is not to be wondered, that thefe little 
fovereigns claimed, and were allowed, a very high degree of 
confequence. The reprefentative of the laft of thefe kings, hap- 
pening to be in Ireland, was invited to an entertainment given 
by the Lord Lieutenant. He chanced to be among the lafi: 
in coming in, and let himfelf down at the foot of the table, 
near the door. The Lord Lieutenant afked him to fit befidc 
him j and Macdonald, who had no Englilh, alked " What 
** the carl faid ?" He bids you move towards the head of 
the table. " Tell the carl, that wherever Macdonald fits, that 
" is the head of the table." The opinion conceived of thefe 
lords in their own country, is emphatically expreffed in the 
fliort epitaph difcovered lately on one of their tombs in Ico- 
lumkill, "Mac-Donuill fato hie-" — as much as to fay, 
that Fate alone could lay Macdonald there. 

The Macdonalds were much celebrated for their hofpitality, 
and no lefs for their generofity. A night's lodging, or a 
fimple meal furnifhed to Macdonald, was often rewarded with 
a farm. That of Coul in Iflay was given to one who had pro- 
cured him a flounder, when he had probably flood much in 
need of it. Many families in the Highlands hold their pro- 
perty in confequence of grants from thefe lords, who con- 
veyed them in charters extremely fhort, but abundantly 
flrong. This will appear from the following fpecimen, 
though divelred of the fpirit and rhyme of the original : » I

Before we conclude this branch of our fubjecT:, we muft 
obferve, that the place in which the caftle of M'Donald 
flood, is now occupied as a church, in which the minifter,

which the kings and lords of the ifles, i/Tued, for ages, their 
arbitrary mandates. Such are the important changes which, 
the revolution of time can effect. 

Ecclefmjlkal Hiftory. — From the contiguity of Kintyre to 
Ireland, one would expedt to find Chriftianity introduced in- 
to it very foon after the year 432, the date of St. Patrick's 
mifiion to Ireland. But it feems the revolutions, mentioned 
above, retarded its progrefs, till fome time after the re-efta- 
blifhment of the kingdom, by the fons of Ere, in the 6th 
century. It was towards the middle of this century, when 
St. Ciaran, S^tterin, or ®htirinus the father and founder of 
the monaflery of Gen upon the Shenan, became the apoftle 
of Kintyre. He took up his humble refidence in a cave near 
Campbelton, which (till retains his name. Here a fountain 
of pure water fupplied almoft one half of the wants of na- 
ture ; and the figure of the crofs, which he had cut upon 
the rock, furnifhed his foul with fubjects of meditation. 

Ufher and others mention two faints of the name of da- 
mn, diftinguifhing them by the epithets of Saighre, and Fi- 
i'nts Artificis. But it is probable there was in reality but one, 

as

as the latter epithet is only a tranflation of the former. St. 
Ciaran was one of the matters of St. Columba, the apoftle 
of the Pi&amp;s and Weftern Hies, who addrcffed a Latin hymn 
to him, which is laid to be ftill extant *. 

The church of Kilkerran was vveil endowed by the Mac- 
donalds, Lords of Kintyre ; but what number of ecclefiaftics 
it maintained, upon its eftabliftiment, or what was the a- 
mount of its revenues, cannot now be afcertained ; though 
j'bme account of them may probably be found in the Char- 
tulary of the Abbey of Paifley, to which this church, with' 
all its revenues, was annexed by the patrons. The motive 
which induced them to annex it to fo diftant an abbey, and 
not to that of Saddel, built by themfelves in the neighbour- 
hood, probably arofe from the circumftance of Somerled's 
having fallen, with a number of his followers, fo near Paifley, 
that the prayers of the good people there were judged ne- 
csflary to fecure their happinefs above. 

In 

* A Gaelic or Irifh prayer, afcribed to CiAran himfelf, is 
alfo preferved in a very ancient M. S. miflTal, lately difcovered 
in Drummond Caftle, and fuppofed to be that which was bor- 
rowed by Father Innes, as mentioned in his Critical Eflay. 
This prayer, of which the tenor follows, feems to have been 
compofed by the faint, while he refided in the cave, which we 
have mentioned. ' Alas, that a /earned clerk fhould perifh ! O 

* thou Son (of God) have mercy on one devoted to thy fervice. 

* Heal and quicken my benumbed foul. Long have thy vifits 
« been denied to my cell. Yet I fliould have quickly failed, if 

* thou hadft not fupported me. I will therefore render thee 

* the tribute of my higheft praife, before the multitude of the 
« people ; and place whatever pangs I may endure, to the fcore 
' of my own fin and folly.' ' 

The good man's pangs were not of long continuance. In 
the 37th year of his age, and 548th of the Chriftian Era, he 
left them all behind him, and changed his cave for the regions 
of glory. But the parifh ftill retains his name in the appella- 
tion of Cil Ciarain, (or Kilkerran); and the ruins of the 
church, which was dedicated to him, are ftill to be feen in die 
center of the principal burying ground of the, town and parifh 
of Campbelton.

In thofe days prayers were in much eftimation, and well 
rewarded. The tide of one of the articles in the chartula- 
ry of Paifley is, * Charta Reginaldi filii Sutnerledi, Domini ln~ 

* chegal*, de uuo denario ex qualibet domo in terra fua de qua exit 

* fumus.' In the fame chartulary there are 4 or 5 other papers, 
relative to the grant and annexation of the church of Kil- 
kerran to that abbey ; but whatever its revenues were, the 
Donors certainly made a notable bargain, when we confider 
that the condition was, ' for their own falvation, and that of 

* their heirs for ever f 

With all their warlike ferocity, the potentates of Kintyre 
had a great degree of piety, which they manifefted, accord- 
ing to the cuftom of the times, in building and endowing 
churches. Befides his grant to the abbey of Paifley, Regi- 
nald finifhed and endowed the abbey of Saddel in Kintyre, 
to which his fon Roderick gave alfo large donations. Do- 
aiald, the fon and fucceflbr of Roderick, gave likewife 8 cows 
and other matters yearly to the abbey of Paifley ; and An- 
gus, the fon and fucceflcr of Donald, gave to the fame ab- 
bey an annuity of half a mark, together with the church of 
Kilkerran, as already mentioned ; and the deed was after- 
wards confirmed by Alexander his fon. 

It has been already obferved, that Campbelton confifted, 
cill lately, of four diftinct parifhes. One of thefe, as men- 
tioned above, was dedicated to St. Ciaran. The three o- 
thers were dedicated to the Saints ConJIan, Michael^ and 
Caomhghin, (pronounced Coivt/i, and tranflned Clement). 
Each probably laboured to plant the gofpel in that parifh, 
which, out of gratitude, preferved his name. Of the two 
lafh fome account may be feen in the fanBologies ; but we do 
not recollect to have met with any written account of the 

firft-,

firft ; although the many fragments of elegant crofles found 
here, (which were fo numerous as to give their name to the 
adjacent farm,) give reafon to believe, that the church was 
much frequented, and the faint of no ordinary fame. Of 
Coivin's exalted merit, a moll honourable teftimony may be 
feen in a Gaelic addrefs, or invocation, to him, preferved in 
the ancient miflal already mentioned, and beginning with 
« O Coivin, now with Archangels,' &amp;cc. 

Thefe two faints, however, Couflan and Coivin, though 
both of an unqueftiouable piety, feem to have had ideas on 
fome fubje&amp;s totally different. Couflan, for inflance, incul- 
cated in the frrongeft manner the indiflblubility of the mar- 
riage tie, (a point probably as neceffary to be inculcated in 
his time, as in our own) ; and if lovers did not yet find it 
convenient to marry, their joining hands through a hole in 
a rude pillar near his church, was held, as it continued to be 
till almoft the prefent day, an interim tie of mutual fidelity, 
fo ftrong and facred that, it is generally believed, in the 
country, none ever broke it, who did not foon after break 
his neck, or meet with fome other fatal accident. 

Coivin, in his diftricl, took a quite different courfe. He 
propofed, that all who did not find themfelves happy and 
contented in the married ftate, fhould be indulged with the 
opportunity of parting, and making a fecond choice. For 
that purpofe he instituted an annual Solemnity, at which all 
the unhappy couples in his parifh were to nifemble at his 
church •, and, at midnight, all prefent were Sufficiently blind- 
folded, and ordered to furround the church three times at 
full fpeed, with a view of mixing the lots in the urn. The 
moment that ceremony was over, without allowing an inftant 
to recover from the confufion, the word cabhog (feize quickly) 
was pronounced ; upon which every man laid hold of the firft 
female he met with, whether old or young, handfome or ugly,

good or bad, lhe was his wife till the next anniverfary re- 
turn of the folemnity, when he had as good a chance (if he 
chofe to fubmit to fuch hazard) of getting a worfe or a bet- 
ter bargain. The faint foon brought his parifhioncrs to un- 
derftand, that they had reafon to be fatisfied with a condi- 
tion, which, with all his Chriftian licence, there was little 
profpeft of mending by a change ; and, for many ages, the 
cuftom has been only handed down by tradition. 

The ruins of the chapels of St. Couflan and St. Coivin, 
having had the good fortune to be at a convenient difhnce 
from houfes, are in tolerable prefervation, and the ground 
about them is ftill facred to fepulture. That of St. Michael, 
furrounded by farmer's houfes, and, in the true Scottifh llile, 
deftitute of inclofure, was found to be fuitable to other ufes, 
to which the mod of it has been, and ftill is, fljamefully ap- 
plied. Saints, who believe in the refurrecTion of the body, 
and lavages, who never heard of it, relpect the remains of 
the dead ; but we, who would not be denrous to pafs for 
either, as we have almoft entirely furmounted the prejudices 
of both, never think of enclofing the remains of the dead, to 
guard their allies from infult. 

Monuments, Manners % CSV. — Having touched upon the ci- 
vil and ecclefiaftical hiftory of this parifh, we fliould next 
endeavour to difcover the hiftory of its arts and fciences, its 
manufactures and commerce ; but of thefe, the kings and 
lords of a dozen of centuries, have hardly left a trace behind 
them. War was the only bufinefs of princes and people, in 
which they were fo conftantly engaged, that, excepting the 
ruins of a ftw caftles and chapels fcattered over the face of 
the country, no monuments remain of their having ever 
exifted. Even thefe belong to the era of the fords, and not 
to that of the kings of Kintyre. The. only monumeDts ever 

fuppofed 



of Campbeiton. 

fuppofed to have reference to the time of the kings, are the 
immenfe barrows, and the rude pillars which mark the 
fcenes of battles, and cover the duft of the flain. Thefe are 
fo numerous throughout the country, that it is unneceffary 
to particularife any of them. The greateft number of them, 
however, is to be found about the head of Loch-Crinan *, 
where probably the families of Kintyre and Lorn often 
met each other, (being nearly mid- way from their refpec- 
tive refidences,) to fight their battles. And yet, from the 
appearance of fuch of them as have been opened or removed, 
(which were found to contain half burnt bones and afhes, 
fometimes in rude earthen urns, and fometimes in fquare 
ftone coffins,) it mould feem, that they had been raifed be- 
fore the introduction of Chriftianity j as burning the dead has 
not been pracYifed fince that period, nor was it probably the 
cuftom for a long time before it, at leaft by the natives f . 
Under the obelifk?, or pillars, the fame contents are found, 
as under the cairns or barrows. 

A great number of forts, fuppofed to be Danifh, are to be 
feen along the fea-coaft of Kintyre \ and there is alfo a vitri- 
fied tower ; but, being beyond the bounds of this parifh, it 
is foreign to the limits of this work. Of the houfes, built 
with lime in this country, none can be fuppofed to be ante- 
rior to the 1 2th century. The little caftles of this kind, 
within the dominions of the Lords of Kintyre, and of the ifles, 
were, for the greater part, of a ftill later date. The beft and 
oldeft of their buildings, in this country, was the abbey of 

Saddel, 

* This bay may have had its name from Crinan, the war- 
like Abbot of Dunkeld, (and father of a race of Kings,) who 
fell in battle in 1045. 

f The Danes may have burned their dead, in their incurfions 
into thefe parts in later times. But thefe monuments are found 
often in the inland parts, to which the Danes never penetrated.

Saddel, begun by Somerled, and finifhed by his fon. But 
this is alfo beyond the limits of this parifh, and cannot there- 
fore, with propriety, enter into the account of it. 

If the diffracted ftate of this country was an obftacle, the 
income of the Lords of Kintyre and of the ifles, was not (as

rude ages, no other ufe could be made of any revenue. 
Luxury was unknown ; and, of the grofs produce of the 
earth, the lord could confume no more than his valTal, or 
meaneft follower. 

The mode of living, in thefe countries, till of late years, was 
extremely Ample; and, though originally rather rude and barba- 
rous,'vvas never, in any period, carried to that favage extent, 
which is alledged by fome ancient writers, as Diodorus Siculus, 
Strabo, and even the good St. Jerome, who accufe the Ata- 
cotti, and other aboriginal inhabitants with being cannibals. 
Caefar, Tacitus, and others, who knew them better, lay no 
fuch imputation to the charge of our anceftors. Indeed, as 
they were in the paftoral date of fociety, antecedent to the 
earlieft account they give, this is of itfelf a fufficient refutation 
of that calumny. For no man, who can by any means come 
at a Iheep or cow, will ever think of eating human flefh. 
The moft genuine account of the ftate of the Highlands, a- 
bout the end of the 6th and beginning of the 7th century, 
may be collected from their own writers at that period, (Cu- 
min and Adomnan,) in their account of the life of St. Co- 
lumba. The belt houfes then were only compofed of 
flakes with wands entwined or wattled about them ; for, the 
church of Jona itfelf, the fee of the kingdom, was of that 
construction. The clothing partly confided of the fkins of 
beafts ; for it was a leather jacket that faved one of Colum- 
ba's monks, from a thruft aimed at his mafter by a barbarian, 
which the difciple, flipping between, received on his own 
breaft. Yet they had even then not only woollen, but fome 
linen cloths j for the fhroud of Columba was a fheet of fine 
linen. Venifon and fifh, (even feals are mentioned,) but 
efpecially flefh and milk, were the principal part of their 
food. Folds of cattle are mentioned, from which the faint 
had his milk carried home on a car. Agriculture, however, 

had 



542 



Statiflical Account 



tad by that time made fome progrefs. We find the monks 
at work in the fields, and heaps of grain in the barn. We 
find fome mention made even of fruit trees and orchards ; 
and of a Saxon, at that time, in Icolumkil, who exercifed 
the office or trade of a baker. 

Hogs, too, made no fmall fhare of the food of thofe times. 
A powerful chieftain in Iflay, was entrufted, by the faint, 
with the charge of a PicTtifh Prince, and the monfter put his 
gueft to the fword. « Before he fhall eat of his hogs, faid 
« the faint, after they fhall have fed upon the nuts, he fhall 
4 die.' This circumftance ftrongly marks, not only the mode 
of living, but alfo the barbarity of the times. Theft and 
robbery were common ; but the modern evil, of fpirituous 
liquors, feems to have been then unknown. A leathern bot- 
tle, with only innocent milk, is all the beverage allotted to 
the failor on his voyage. The bed was the bare ground, and 
a {tone the pillow. No mention is made of money. A 
fpear, and not money, is the price paid by the faint, for the 
redemption of a flave or captive. Indeed, in a much later 
period, this root of evil had hardly appeared in our barren 
mountains. About the beginning of the 13th century, the 
donation of the great Lord of Kintyre and the Ifles, to the 
abbey of Paifley, as already mentioned, was half a mark ; 
and, about the fame time, a King of Mann provoked a re- 
bellion, and loft his throne, by fpending ico marks, which 
feem to have been the collected treafure of his kingdom. 

Five or fix centuries feem to have made no change in 
manners, under the later Kings, or their fucceffors, the Mac- 
donalds ; as we find the moft barbarous punifhments inflict- 
ed on criminals and prifoncrs of war, fuch as putting out 
their eyes, and depriving them of fome other members. In 
that period, too, drefs was not much attended to. Monu- 
ments of the 15th and 16th centuries, reprefent even chief-

tains as clad only in a fort of frock, not reaching to the 
knees, and without fhoes to their feet, or any covering to 
their hands and arms. Before this period, however, Kings 
had trowfers and a robe, and alfo fhoes ; for we read of a 
King of the Ifle of Mann, fending his fhoes to his Majefty of 
Dublin, requiring him  to carry them before his people on 
« a high feftival, or expeft his vengeance V By degrees, 
the drefs, firft of the chieftain, and then of the Kings, came; 
to be thac of the common people. The party-coloured plaid 
of the Highlander, was originally the drefs royal, not only 
girt, but loofe and flowing, and fattened before by a fibula 
or brotch. The drefs, reprelented on the monuments of ec- 
clefiallics with us, is not unlike the prefent night-gown, 
reaching down to the heels, and fometimes girt about the 
middle. 

During this long and turbulent period, too, agriculture 
made little or no progrefs. Even fo late as about the middle 
of the laft century, meal, excepting a trifling provifion, re- 
ferved, perhaps, for an infant, was rarely to be found in any 
family throughout the greatell part of the year. Till about 
the fame period, almoft every man was his own taylor, fhoe- 
maker, carpenter, and every thing ; of which many inftances 
have been known, even in our own times. Weaving was 
the only art necefTary to the fimple life of a Highlander, 
which he did not practife himfelf, becaufe it was accounted 
effeminate, inferring more trouble and patience than he 
chofe to beftow. It was therefore left to thofe who profeffed 
it, who were generally females. Of thefe Penelopes, a few

may ftill be found in the Highlands ; and perhaps, in every 
ftage of fociety, the female fex might well be employed in 
the art of weaving : The labour is not hard, and they naffer 
lefs than men by a fedentary life. 

Population — Of the ancient ftate of population in this pa- 
rifh, no fatisfa&amp;ory account can be given ; only that from the 
firft notice we have of the country, it feems, in general, to 
have been well peopled. Early in the 5th century, we find 
the Atacotti (of whofe territory Kintyre made a confiderable 
part) mentioned as making no inconliderable figure in the 
Roman armies, into which great numbers of them probably 
inlifted, when the bulk of their countrymen were driven by 
the Picls into Ireland. They muft have been ftill more nu- 
merous, when they returned under Fergus the fon of Ere, 
and recovered the country from which they had been expel, 
led. Of their number, whatever it may have been, this 
parifh muft have always had a large fhare, as it was the refi- 
dence of the fovereign, and the rendezvous of their fleet. 
This fleet feems to have been very confiderable ; for in 718 
the powers of Kintyre and Lorn contended for the kingdom 
in a fea-fight. Near the fame period, we find the fleet of 
this place (Dalruadhain) fent for, to decide the conteft about 
the right of fuccefiaon to the throne of Ireland ; and in the 
1 2th century, Somerled of Kintyre was, at one time, poffefled 
of 53, and at another of 120 fail. From all which it may be 
inferred, that this part of the country was then well peopled, 
although it is not poffible to afceruin what their numbers 
may have been. 

During the civil wars of laft century, this country is faid to 
have fuffered much, from the ravages of Alexander Macdo. 
nald, called Alijler Macoll, or Coll Kitta, who came over with 
a party of Irifh to aflift Montrofe. The Earl of Antrim was 

expected 



of Campbeliotu 545 



expetfed at the fame time, and a battery, now called the 
Trench, was raifed for his reception, at the mouth of the har- 
bour. About the fame time Kintyre was vifited by the plague, 
which then raged over a great part of Britain. By thefe ca- 
lamities, the number of inhabitants was greatly reduced : And. 
although the lofs was, in fome meafure, made up by a colony of 
Lowlanders, introduced by the Earl of Argyll, yet it is probable 
that the country did not, till very lately, recover its former 
extent of population. The returns made to Dr Webfter, ia 
1755 *, ftate the number of fouls in this parifli, to have been 

4597-

it is not eafy to afcertain their numbers with precifion. They 
are computed at 5000. In fpring 1 79 1 , the exaft number of 
fouls in the landward part of the parifli (the villages of Dalin- 
tober, Dalruadhain, and Lochend, being clafTed with the town)

In the fame year 400 tickets for admiflion to the communion 
were diftributed to the Highlanders in the town, and 500 to the 
Highlanders in the country. By this proportion, the "number 
in the town (liould be 4644. But as the proportion of Low- 
landers in the town is much greater than in the country, and 
the proportion of communicants fewer, owing to fo many of the 
men being abfent, it is believed that 5000, computed to be in 
the town and adjoining villages, is very near the truth. The 
average of. baptifms in the parilh, for nine years part, is 254^.

rence can be drawn, but that, right or wrong, we increafe and

Eccle/wfiical Sinte. — Nearly two thirds of the people are 
Highlanders, and belong to the Highland charge, or firft 
eftablifhed congregation of the parifh. Of the remainder, 
near 1000 are prefumed to be of the Englifli or Lowland 
eftablifhed charge, and about 2coo of the Congregation of 
Relief. There is a minifter and church for each congrega- 
tion. The Highland church has been for fometime ruinous, 
but there is a profpect of its being foon rebuilt. The fti- 
pends of each of the minifters upon the eftablifhment, is 3 
chalders 8 pecks of bear, and 36 1. 13 s. 4 d. Sterling in mo- 
ney. 1 hat of the minifter of the Relief congregation is 
much better. One of the glebes is diftant and partial ; the 
other is under the legal extent ; but the minifter has the legal 
allowance to compenfate the deficiency. In this refpecr, 
however, the minifters have no caufe to complain, as they 
have accefs to market, (if they have money), and need not, 
unlefs they are fo inclined, occupy their glebes at a certain 
lofs, as the clergy of Scotland in general have no alternative. 
A minifter who occupies his glebe muft keep a horfe, (be- 
fides hiring another occafionally), a man, a maid, and a herd. 
The whole produce of four acres will not maintain them, fo 
that he is a loler of more than the full amount of their wages. 
The writer has accordingly known a very accurate and eco- 
nomical minifter beat about among his neighbours, to try if 
any of them would take the gift of his glebe, and furnifn

it contains 200. To each merk-land may be allowed, at an 
average, about 25 head of black cattle, 25 of fheep, and 6 of 
horfes. The breed of horfes and cows is far from beinr*' 
good. The fheep, which are generally oi the native white 
faced kind, are fmall, hut their wool is fine. They are com- 
monly houfect at night, which keeps them dirty, and fubjecls 
them to difeafes. In i'ummer, efpecially, they are, from this 
practice, liable to be i»fefted with a kind of worm or maggot ; 
a diltemper which was prevented or cured by a decoction of 
oak bark, or of broom and ftale urine, when they had not 
the convenience of oil, tar, and brimftone, or the juice of 
tobacco. From the mildnefs of the climate, if flocks, at leaft 
of the hardy native race, were allowed to lie out, the Imear- 
ing praclifed in other places could here be difpenfed with. 

Produce. — The produce of the arable land confifis of bear, 
oats, potatoes, beans, and fometimes a little peafe. Potatoes 
are the principal food of the bulk of the people, for three 
fourths of the year, and therefore they are raifcd in great 
abundance. Nes.t to potatoes, the chief attention of the far- 
mer is directed to the railing of bear, on which he depends 
chitfly for his rent, as he does on potatoes for his fubliftence. 
A confiderable quantity of flax is alio raifed, but little or no 
hay. "When fomewhat more of the land lhall be incloled, 
and fufficiently drained, the fyftem of hufbandry will proba- 
bly be changed. As the greajter part of the laft leafes were 
given by the Duke of Argyll, on condition of making cer- 
tain improvements, inflead of paying an augmentation of 
rents, there is reafon to hope that the face of the country 
will foon affume a better appearance, and that this noble 
proprietor, and others who may be induced to follow his 
example, will be encouraged to purfue, for fome time, fo be. 
neficial a fyftem. His Grace, fome years ago, encouraged a

number of Englifh farmers to fettle on his eftate here, in 
hopes of their introducing a better mode of agriculture than 
was prafHfed in the country j but they have generally adopted, 
rather than changed, the cuftoms of the place. His Grace 
alfo employs a Ikilful improver, to give his beft advice and 
direction to the tenants, from which confiderable benefit may 
in time be expected. At prefent, the forcing of more than a 
due proportion of bear, without a proper rotation, or any re- 
gular intervention of green crops, has a manifeft tendency 
to impoverilh and run out the foil. Another general error 
in the iyftem of farming here is over-plowing, by which 
the farmer diminifhes his grafs, without adding to his corn. 
A plain proof of this is, that oats, at an average, give but 34. 
returns ; fo that a great part of what is fown muft probablv 
fall fhort of 2. 

Imports.— The quantity of corn raifed in the parifh is by 
no means fufficient for its inhabitants in town and country. 
It is computed, that for fome time paft about 2500 bolls of 
meal have been annually imported. Since the late corn law 
took place, oat-meal has not been above i£ d. per pound in 
our market. For the equity of that law we, and indeed all 
the weft ot Scotland, are much indebted to the wildom and 
humanity of the legiflature ; as, if it had paffed in the way 
in which the gentlemen of the eaft country would have had 
it, we fhould have been compelled, occafionally, to have lived 
only upon air and water. The Highlands are already fo 
heavily taxed by their fituation, foil, and climate, that they 
need every pofiible indulgence from government. Of pota- 
toes, butter, cheefe, and black cattle, we have in this parifh 
fufficient for our own ufe, and fomewhat to fpare to our 
neighbours. The furplus is fent to Clyde, with which we 
have fuch regular and conftant intercourfe by packets, that 

our 



of Campbelton, 



our markets here are pretty much regulated by the price of 
provifions there. 

Wild Animals. — In this parifh we have no wild animals, 
birds, reptiles, or any fpecies of vermin, but fuch as are 
common throughout the weft of Scotland. The mole, for- 
merly unknown, has lately made an inroad to the extent of 
fome miles within the ifthmus. 

Minerals, Fuel, &amp;c. — There is abundance of coal within 
3 miles of Campbelton, and a canal lately made to convey it 
to the town, where the fmall cart load (of which 3 fhould 
make a ton) fells at 2s. 'j-d. About 40 carts a-day are con- 
fumed in the town. Turf or peat is commonly ufed in the 
country ; as it is alfo by many of the poorer fort within the 
town. There is likewife, in this parilh, abundance of Fuller's 
earth, and foap rock,, which, it is thought, may be manu- 
factured into fine ware, or Britifh china. 

Burgh. — Campbelton, originally a fmall fifhing village, 
was erected into a royal burgh, in 170 1. It is governed by 
a provoft, two bailies, a dean of guild, counfellors, and a 
treafurer. This laft employment is not very burdenfome, as 
the town has no landed property, and but a fmall revenue *. 
We have, therefore, no great complaints of abufe, nor any 
loud cry for reform. Where the magiftrates of burghs, like 
the elders of churches, hold offices which occafion trouble, 
and produce little emolument, perhaps, they rather deferve 
the thanks of the public for what they do, than their cen- 
fnre for what they leave undone. 

Harbour, 

* Its principal funds arife from a tax of or a lippie in 
the boll, levied on all the meal and grain brought in from the 
country ; and from the tack profits of a miln, harbour dues, 
and church feats. 



552 



Statiftical Account 



Harbour, School, l&amp;c — The town has an excellent harbour, 
nbout x miles long and i broad, in the form of a crefcent, 
irom 6 to 10 fithom water, good holding ground, furround- 
ed with high hills on each fide, and an ifland to fhelter it at 
the entrance. We have alio a good ichool with two ma- 
tters ; the falary of the one (20 I.) is paid by the heritors of 
the parifh, and that of the other ( 1 0 1.) by the burgh. 

Fi/Jjeries, Commerce, CSV. — The principal trade of the place 
is the fifhing of herring?. To this bufinefs the inhabitants 
naturally turned their attention early, as their fituation for 
purfuing it was favourable. They have one of the beft har- 
bours in the world as their pride and boaft. They are near 
good markets, both on the Clyde and in Ireland : And they have 
ready accefs to the filhing grounds. , With thefe advantages, 
while (like the Dutch) they kept within the limits of that 
economy, which ought to be the characterise of fifhermen, 
while they proceeded no farther than their little flock allow- 
ed, and while every man on board had a fhare of the veflel 
and cargo, they did extremely well, even without the aid of 
public bounty. Now the cafe is altered. The mode of living 
is expenfive ; the wages of men are high ; the fi fhermen are 
no longer owners ; excepting perhaps the mafter who may 
have fometimes a fhare ; and, even when that is the cafe, 
may be able, at times, to feparate his own intereft from that 
of the other owners ; and, what is ftill worfe, almoft every 
man in the place, with or without an adequate flock, is am- 
"bitious to have a fhare in one or more expenfive well found 
veffels, or herring buffes. The great rife in the price of oak 
Haves and barrels, has alfo become of late a heavy draw-back 
on the bufinefs. # For thefe reafons, it has not greatly pro- 
spered, although foftercd by the kind hand of Government. 
The bufs bounty laws have, for thefe 26 years paft, been, 

with.

with different alterations and amendments, renewed at the 
end of every 7th year. By the prefent law, (which is to ex- 
pire in 1793,) they have 30 s. per ton, when they make two- 
thirds of a full cargo, and only 20 s. per ton, when they 
have lefs'. The hardfhip of having the bounty lefs, when 
they have little or no fifti, and therefore ftand moft in need 
of it, is obvious. It is not then fufficient, they fay, to de- 
fray the expence'incurred by the number of men, which they 
muft have by the law, more than are neceffary for the bufi- 
nefs. They hope, therefore, that, upon a renewal of the adt, 
they may be allowed 30 s. per ton, whatever may . be their 
fuccefs in fifhing. With refpecl: to the article of fait, the 
prefent law gave fatisfaction, as being wife and liberal. This 
article they can now have from their neighbours at Liver- 
pool, on eafier terms than they had it formerly from Spain 
and Portugal. But they ftill complain of the many incon- 
venient and embarraffing regulations, to which they are fub- 
jected at cuftom-houfes, before fait bonds can be cancelled. 
It is the general opinion, that the whole prefent fyftem of 
laws, refpe5ting fait for curing fifh and other articles, ftands 
much in need of being revifed and amended. 

The following is the average ftate of the fifhing bufinefs 
in this place, for the laft 7 years.

In a fuccefbful year, the profits of a voyage, between iifh 
and bounty, are faid to be confiderable : But it is reckoned 
a bad bufinefs, when a veflel falls fhort of catching half its 
cargo. One thing is evident, that neither* individuals, npr 
the community here, have made much by profecuting the 
fifliery on the prefent plan ; and one may venture to fay, they

never fhall. It is a game of hazard, which obliges the adven- 
turer often times to live upon hope ; and when that hope is 
at any time realifed, he builds too much on the faith, that 
the fame good fortune will continue. In the elevation oc- 
cafioned by a profperous moment, he launches into expences, 
and projects, fo difproportioned to his capital, that his ftock 
is foon exhaufted, and, if his fortune changes, his credit fol- 
lows. Had the people of Campbelton exerted the perfeve- 
rance, induitry, and zeal beftowed on the fifhery for 40 years 
paft, upon agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, in gene- 
ral, their gains, though fmall and flow, would have been fure 
and fteady ; the inhabitants, like others who followed this 
courfe, would have been eafy, and the place would have been 
Ilourifhing. It is perhaps a low enough calculation, to fet 
down the average of laft 7 years, as the average of the 40, 
and to reckon the ftock in trade, or the value of 50 velTels, 
with their materials of boats, nets, calks, and fait, at 40,0001. 
Add to this the yearly bounty given by government, which 
lias not been niggardly, and one will naturally fuppoie the 
people of Campbelton to be rich. But, inffead of that, there 
is not, perhaps, in Scotland, fuch an aggregate of miferable 
objects, in fo fmall a place. The poor on the church roll 
and in the ftreets, (who do non include all the indigent in 
their number,) make above 5 * T of the whole inhabitants *. 

The 

* This uncommon proportion is partly owing to the number 
of poor families who come here from other parts of the High- 
lands, in hopes of getting fome employment and bread, many 
of whom are foon a burden on the community. The profpect 
of purfuing the trade of begging to greater advantage, in a 
place more populous than the neighbourhood, probably induces 
others to take hut$ here ; from which they are not hindered, it 
they pay, or promife, a few fhillings of rent. As for the poor 
on the parifli roll, they may be faid to be fupported by the poor.

The perilous trade, which the people of the place purfue, 
occafions yearly the lofs of many lives ; and, of courfe, a 
number of poor widows and helplefs orphans. A charity 
fchool, (fupported by the Duke of Argyll, and the Society 
for Propagating Chriftian Knowledge,) which, for many years, 
contained above a hundred children, could never receive all 
the objects. Befides the poor left by the lofs of lives, the 
failors who furvive foon grow old •, and then many of them 
have no refource but begging. Economy is not the virtue 
of a failor ; and if it were, it would be hard to pratt'ife it, on 
an income of 10 1. or 12 1. with the burden of a numerous 
family. 

Unprofitable, however, as this bufinefs has been, efpecially 
for fome time paft, it is certainly of great importance, when 
viewed in the light of public and national utility. What- 
ever is gained from the fea is all clear profit ; and the fifh- 
eries form a nurfery for feamen, which, both as a commer- 
cial and warlike nation, we ought to keep up. Befides the 
number furnifhed to the Clyde and Liverpool traders, it is 
faid, that, from this port, no lefs than 800 went to the navy, 
during the courfe of the late American war. Their encou- 
ragement 

common people, keep their colleftions to themfelves ; and many 
of the affluent and upper ranks, neither come often to church, 
nor fend their offerings. The great family, to which more than 
half the parilh belongs, refides elfewhere, and joins to its other 
virtues, an exemplary attendance on public worfhip there. The 
time has been when our rending heritors did fo here, nor thought 
it beneath them to a£t as elders, in looking after the concerns of 
the poor. But the prefent generation is more enlighted than 
the former, and philojophy is making progrefs. Thofe, however, 
who have any thing valuable to preferve or to lofe, even in the 
prefent world, Ihould inquire, whether a regard to religion and 
its inftitutions be not their great palladium. Neglecl this, and 
what muft follow '—France will tell, Behold this Pharos, and

ragemcnt to fervc his Majefty now is much better, in confe- 
quence of the late humane and important regulations, rela- 
tive to the mode of paying their wages, which enable them 
to be of fervice to their families. For thefe regulations, (of 
which copies have been tranfmitted to the clergy throughout 
the kingdom, in order to be communicated as occafion fhould 
require,) they are indebted to the laudable attention of the 
Right Honourable Henry Dundas, acting as Treafurer of the 
Navy. Still they complain, that the boatfwain is rough, as 
the element around him j for which at times there may be 
need. 

Poor.—* As beggbig is a free trade here, perhaps too many 
are allowed to profefs it ; yet it would require much ten- 
dernefs and delicacy to reftrain it. The weekly collections 
of the 2 eftablilhed congregations, make about 15 s. The 
intereft of a fmall fund *, and fome other adventitious aids, 
enable the feffion to diftribute about 7 1. in every fix weeks, 
among upwards of 100 of the moft needy, who are on their 
roll, and a trifle to about 60 more, at the annual difpenfation 
of the facrament of the Lord's fupper, when the collection 
commonly exceeds 20 1. Afleffinents are not defirable if 
they can be prevented ; but ere long they will probably be 
unavoidable here, efpecially if the filhery continues to be the 
principal bufinefs of the place. 

Dijlilleries. — Next to the fiflfing of herrings, the bufinefs 
moft attended to in Campbelton, is the diftilling of whifky ; 
which the following is the ftate for the prefent year.

In the town 22 5500 
In the country 10 2134 

32 7634 

Of this quantity 5000 bolls are computed to be the pro- 
duce of the parifli. The remainder is brought from diffe- 
rent places, and a confiderable quantity of the fpirits is again 
difpofed of throughout the Highlands. This bufinefs is un- 
doubtedly gainful to a few individuals, but extremely ruinous 
to the community. It confumes their means, hurts their 
morals, and deftroys both their understandings and their 
health. Were it not for preventing the temptation of fmug- 
gling, a duty next to a prohibition would be mercy. At 
pfefent the law, refpedting diftilleries in the Highlands, is fo 
favourable to the trade, as to be hurtful in its confequences 
to the morals of the people. When a man may get half an 
Englilh pint of potent fpirits, or, in other words, get com- 
pletely drunk for 2d. or 3d.* many will not be fober. In 
this place, however, very few, comparatively fpeaking, arc 
given to drunkennefs, as people are feldom guilty of excefs in 
what is their daily fare. But, abftracting from this confi- 
deration, the trade, when carried on to fuch an extent, is ex- 
tremely hurtful to this parifh in another point of view. To 
it we owe the want of wheat or flour of our own, which, 
takes yearly out of the place above 2000 1. ; befides the want 
of a fufficiency of meal to ferve the inhabitants, for which 
we fend away about as much more. Both thefe fums might 
be faved, if we could be kept from deftroying fo much of 
our own and our neighbours grain. But the profpedt of e-

normous gain, firft tempts the indigent to convert their little 
crop into a pernicious liquor, and then the lavr obliges them 
to drink it themfelves, as it cannot be fold but where they 
have equal poverty and equal liberty. Thus, in the trite 
ftory, the two publicans, who went alternately to each others 
houles, with the fame twopence, drank both their cellars dry. 
Were we allowed to export a part, to help us to pay our 
meal and flour, it would do us much fervice. We have, 
however, much caufe to be thankful for the prefent law, as 
it ftands ; for it has been productive of much good to the 
country. It has put the bufinefs into few hands, and there- 
by removed from many a temptation, too ftrong for their 
feeble virtue. It has happily put an end to fmuggling ; and, 
as we muft have fome liquor, it makes us drink our own, 
and allows us to drink it better, than when it was made clan- 
deftinely and imperfectly. The revenue too has been raifed 
fince, by our collector, (Mr. Mackenzie), to full four times 
what it was before the act took place ; and the farmer gets 
a better price, and better payment, for his grain. Still, 
however, it were much to be wifhed, that Good Ale* 
was fubftituted in lieu of whifky, and wheat and green crops 
for the greater part of our bear. 

Manufaclures.— It is fome relief to turn from this unplea- 
fant fubject, to the dawn of manufactures among us. For 
thefe 2 or three years paft, a number of young girls arc pro- 
fitably employed, in tambouring muflins fent from Glafgow, 
and contribute to the fupport of themfelves and parents. 
About 50 weavers are alfo employed in working cotton. yarn 
from the fame place. And yet our own linen yarn is ex- 
ported, unwrought, to the value of near 2000 1. per annum. 
If, inftead of this, we manufactured it ourfelves, it would 

yield,

to do fo, efpecially as a bleachlleld is eftablifhed in the pa- 
rifh, in confequence of encouragement and aid given to it, 
by the Duke of Argyll. 

Mifcellaneous Observations. — The valued rent of the parifli 
is orol. 9 s. 5d. Sterling. The real rent, from the great 
number of proprietors in the town, and from fome of the 
heritors having much of their property in their own hands, 
cannot be precisely afcertained. The quantity of batcher 
meat, flaughtered yearly for the town and (hips, is computed 
to be as follows ; namely,

* A mode lately adopted at this office, and, it feems, at fome 
others, makes it much lefs ufeful to the people, and productive 
to the revenue, than it would otherwife be. The runners, in 
conformity, it is prefumed, to law and eftablifhed ufage, were 
in the practice of delivering the letters in town, at a time when, 
at any rate, they were waiting their difpatches, and of convey- 
ing fuch letters to places on the road, as did not lie out of their 
way. But now, unlefs the inhabitants of the town and coun- 
try fhall conftantly repair to the office to inquire for their own 
letters, they may be returned as dead, without their ever hear- 
ing of them. This mud be the cafe, efpecially with refpect to 
thofe who are feldom in the receipt of letters, and do not there- 
fore know when to look or call for them, as the faculty of the 
fecond-ftght is loft, which would be neceftary to give them, or 
the revenue, that benefit for which the office was intended.

Charafter of the People —The people of Campbelton, in 
their drefs and manners, diffrr little from thofe of other fea- 
port towns in the kingdom, of the fame magnitude. They 
are, in general, orderly and well behaved ; courteous to 
Grangers, and kind to the poor. They afford perhaps too 
much bufinefs to attorneys or writers, of whom half a dozen 
refide.in the town. Want of employment difpofes, and in- 
deed obliges, many to be often idle, and their general po- 
verty leads too many to pilfering ; while the cheapnefs of 
ipirits, and the intolerable number of drain houfes, are con- 
tinual temptations to drunkennefs and riot. Intoxication, in- 
deed, proves oftentimes fatal to many. In the country part 
of the parifh, the people are more regular and frugal. There 
they ufually work hard, live poorly, and are foon old. On 
Sundays they are decently dreffed ; the men in the manufac- 
ture of their wives, the wives from the importation of the 
merchant. One circumftance in the general character of the 
lower clafs of people, both in town and country, according 
to the complaint and experience of their clergy, confifts in 
the little attention paid to every thing beyond their worldly 
interefts, and a woeful ignorance in matters of religion ; 
though, in other refpetts, they are abundantly intelligent ; 
which may be afcribed partly to two caufes, operating gene- 
rally over the whole kingdom ; namely, neglecl in giving a 
religious education to young people ; the principal care, 
which occupies the attention of matters and parents, being 
only to qualify them for bufinefs ; — and, again, to a more 
than ufual negleft in attending public worfhip, which is no 
lefs necefTary, than the early inftilling of good principles j 
the temper and conduct of men, being at leaft as much re- 
gulated by habit as by principle. But it is not to thefe ge- 
neral caufes, that the evil, complained of here, is to be chiefly 
attributed, but to the want of fchools in the country ; to

the poverty and mode of living of the generality of the in- 
habitants in the town ; the extent of the parifli ; and to the 
want of accefs to public worfhip arid inftru6tion, occafioned 
by the ruinous ftate of the eftablilbed churches, which, for 
25 years paft, have been alternately unfit for the public exer- 
cife of devotion. But, it is to be hoped, this reproach will 
foon be removed, together with its principal caufes, A cha- 
rity fchool has been for fome years eftablifhed in the town, 
and two more are about to be erected in the country, in 
confecjuence of the liberal encouragement offered by the 
Duke of Argyll, where his Grace's interelt is chiefly con- 
cerned, and an application made to the Society for Propa- 
gating Chriftian Knowledge, for their aid. The Highland 
church too, fo long wanted, and fo much needed, is about 
to be rebuilt •, and the younger jeople, from feeing the bet- 
ter fuccefs oF inanufacturesj become every day lei's devoted 
to the fea-faring line. A public library was llkewife let on 
foot a few years ago, of which any one, who chooles, may 
have the benefit for 6 s. a year. This inllitution promifes 
much utility, by diffufing general knowledge and a tafie for 
reading. A library, confiftmg of religious tracts and facred 
writings, has alfo been lately fet on foot by one of the cler- 
gymen, who expccls much good from his inftitution. The 
books, are, with little trouble, handed to fuch perfons as at- 
tend for the purpofe of reading between fermons. Every 
reader, or fharer in this compilation, pays only 1 s. per an- 
num ; and it is intended, when the inftitution can afford 
it, to give the ufe of the books, that have been for the great- 
eft length of time in the circle, to fuch of the poor, as may 
wifh to read them, gratis. Books of controverfy, (which 
are read with fuch avidity by the common people in Scot- 
land,) are carefully excluded from this collection, as the 
fruit which they produce is bitter. The ancient martyr

commonly the cafe. 

Improvements.— ^Although the people may be faid to have 
the means of happinefs, in fome meafure, within their reach, 
yet the interefts of the parifh would be obvioufly promoted, 
if fome of the lower grounds were inclofed, and if the high- 
er were flocked with fheep. As they require an extenfive 
range, the hilly parts of feveral contiguous farms might be 
occupied by a joint ftock, in which every farm might have 
an intereft, in proportion to its (hare in the bounds. The 
profits of fuch a ftock would go much farther to pay the 
rents, than any other produce which may be derived from a 
mountainous country ; more meat would be brought to mar. 
ket, and the wool would be at hand for manufacture and 
employment. But God forbid ! that the people, as in other 
places, fhould be obliged to remove in order to make room 
for fheep. The principal proprietor of this country has hap- 
pily difcovered all along a marked averfion to remove his 
people, and often refuied the higher offers of the few, for pof- 
feffions held at inferior rents by the many. In all the pe. 
ninfula of Kintyre, there is but one confiderable fheep ftock, 
and that on a mountain incapable for cultivation. The op- 
pofite fyftem, which has been carried to fuch an extreme 
in the Highlands, is perhaps as adverfe to the interefts of 
the proprietor, as it is detrimental to the kingdom at large. 
To the latter it is an obvious and irreparable lofs, to banifh 
that hardy race of men, by whom its battles have been fo 
often fought *, and its fleets fo often manned. To the 
proprietor, too, it is an obvious difadvantage, to have his 

lands

lands kept in a ftate of nature ; to which may be added, the 
diminution of that political confequence and weight in ib- 
ciety, which, upon emergencies, he would derive from being 
at the head of a number of people, inftead of their fleecy 
fubflitutes. To this it is anfwered, That a fhepherd and 
his dog can manage half a parifh under fheep, and confe- 
quentiy, that he can afford to give more rent, than a fcore or 
two of farmers, who, following the ancient culture, muff, main- 
tain theirfamilies out of its produce. But they do not confider, 
that fuch families work hard, live upon little, and not only 
maintain themfelves, but mend the foil, adding not only to its 
cultivation, but preferving and upholding the labour of ages 
from becoming again a foreft or wildernefs. The value of every 
eftate muft arife from its animal and vegetable productions ; 
and if it can be fo managed as to produce the nobler animal 
mati) without diminifhing the number of marketable com- 
modities, a national as well as local benefit is accomplifhed. 
How eafily might this two-fold advantage be effecTed, even 
in the moll barren and rugged parts of the Highlands ! Let 
the fheep occupy the mountains ; but let the valley, or the 
narrow plain, bordering upon the ftream or rivulet, be given 
to the people. There labour and indufiry would foon raife 
food fufficient, not only to fupply their families, but even 
the undiminished flock with fubfiftence. This is not the 
language of mere fpeculation, but of experience. A few 
years ago, a large eftate in the Highlands was, according to 
the rage of the times, converted into fheep paflure, and given 
in leafe to a few rich graziers at an advanced rent. So much 
humanity, however, was fliewn to fome of the poor people, 
who could not provide for themfelves elfcwhere, that they 
were allowed one large farm among them, the rent of which 
was advanced, by degrees, to the general ftandard. There 
they fat down, to the number cf about 39 families, and, at 

a 



Siatl/lkal Account 



a confidcrablc cxpence, built for themfelves tolerable habits*, 
tions. The arable part of the firm, with as much ground 
as could be improved by cultivation, they divided into fhares, 
proportionate to their refpective famiiies. This being done, 
they fell to work with plough, fpade, and mattcck, occafio- 
nally uniting their forcer, to what they could not fingly per- 
form. At the fame tune they joined their little money, and 
whatfoever they could raife upon credit, to put a common 
frock of Uieep on the mountain, and employed a common 
fhepherd to take the charge of them. Their flock profper- 
ed, and their ground, rendered fertile by (heir exertions, 
produced enough to iupply the wants of nature, which are 
all a Highlander requires. In fhort, they io effectually im- 
proved the ground and their own circumftances together, 
that a rich neighbour, envying their profperiry, perfuaded the 
landlord to transfer the mountain to him, alledging that the 
plain alone would fuflice for the prefent p-'fleflbrs. But 'this 
proving to be abfolutely impoflible, of conference they were 
ruined. The experiment, however, was fairly tried, and from 
too to 150 fouls not only derived their living out of the 
farm, but paid their rent, perhaps without any fenfible dimi- 
nution of the cattle which it was capable of maintaining, if 
the plain had not been tilled. By fuch management as this, 
the hills might" be covered with fheep, the plains with corn, 
the Highland eftates would be improved, and the people 
would be rendered happy. 

Another improvement, much wanted in this parifh, is 
planting, of which it is almoft totally deftitute. Befides 
beautifying the face of the country, this would in time fave 
the money., which muft otherwife be difburfed by the inhabi- 
tants for various purpofes. At prefent the trees in the parifn 
are fo rare, that a child could almoft tell them ; yet there are 

enough 



of Campbelton, 



enough to demonftrate, that if man were active^ nature would 
be kind. 

The manufacture of tiles, a fimple one, and eafily carried 
on, where there is abundance of clay and coal, is alfo an im, 
provement that ought to be introduced, as it is eafily acquir- 
ed, and would fave confiderable funis of money, fent regular- 
ly every year for that article to Glafgow. By thefe means al- 
fo an effential benefit would redound to the farmers, who£e 
yearly expenditure, in ftraw and workmanfhip for their 
thatched roofs, is very confiderable ; nor do they enjoy the 
deanlinefs or comfort, which they might derive from tiles. 
If this article were within their reach, it would probably lead 
to a totr.l change in their mode of building, as they have a- 
bundance of ftone and lime at hand. The country, at pre- 
fent, is infefted with rats, mice, and other vermin, which, 
when they have once taken pofTtflion, can never be diflodged 
from mud walls and thatched roofs. The introduction of 
buildings, impervious to fuch intruders, would be of confider- 
able advantage to the farmer, by faving a great deal of his 
grain from depredation *. 

The growing of wheat, to anftver the demand of the place, 
would, as has been already mentioned, fave to the country 
2000 1. per annum. Thofe, who have raifed this fpecies of 
grain in fmall quantities, lament the inconvenience they are 
fubject to, by having no mill to grind it ; but it is to be hop- 
ed, that the town mill will be fo improved in its machinery, 
as to remove this caufe of complaint. 

Railing green crops would alfo benefit the farmer, and the 
town would foon be properly fupplied with ftall-fed butcher 
meat, throughout the winter and fpring } which at prefent, 

during

taken by the Dnke of Argyll's chamberlain or fteward here,

during thefe fcafons, is fcarce and bad. Inftead of exhaufting 
their land by over- cropping, could the farmers be perfuaded 
to lay it down in heart, under grals feeds, and to give it 
longer reft in pafture, they would foon find their account 
in it. 

But the moft general advantage of this parifh, and of all 
the weftern Highlands and Ifles of Scotland, would arife by 
their being for ever exempted from the oppreffive duty upon 
coals carried coaft-ways, as at prefent two or three months 
of the beft feafon of the year are fpent by the farmers, and 
other inhabitants, in preparing a miferable and precarious 
kind of fuel, when they fhould be carrying on fencing, drain- 
ing, making lime, comport manures, and other means of 
improvement. Till this duty is abolifhed, Campbelton can 
derive but little advantage from its having coal fo near it ; as 
the price will always keep pace with that which we muft pay 
for coal imported. And confidering its inferior quality, per- 
haps it is higher ; fo that in fadt we may be faid to pay the 
duty, though, ftridlly fpeaking, duty free. The mofles in 
many of the ifles, and in many parts of the continent, are 
now exhaufted, and the diftrefs of the inhabitants loudly calls 
for the equity and humanity of government, for a mitigation 
of their diftrefs *. 

With regard to the town of Campbelton, its particular in- 
terefts would beft be promoted, by the introduction of fome 
ufeful manufacture. Till that fhall happen, in fpite of its 
natural advantages, it muft always remain poor. The wo- 
men and children are too heavy a burden on the poor failor, 
whofe wages can hardly furnifh himfelf with bare fubfiftence, 
inftead of having a family to maintain, who at prefent can

contribute little to their own fupport, except by working up 
fiOiing nets. In the mean time, the firft and mod obvious 
manntaclure t-. be fet on foot, is the making of fail cloth and 
cordage i by mcnns of which a fum, which, it is faid, amounts 
yearly to more than 3000 1. would be prevented from going 
out of rhe country. 

Much good alio would arife, by a rigorous fuppreffion of 
petty dram fhops kept in hovels, ieveral of them fo poor, 
that their whole contents could not, perhaps, defray the ex- 
pence of a licence. 

Lajl!y t Perlons, bred to fuch trades as are moft necefTary 
for us, Ihould be invited and encouraged to fettle here. So- 
cieties ought to be formed, whofe large numbers would make 
up for their fmall ability. To every ufeful fettler of this 
kind, all heritors and proprietors of lands or hpufes ought to 
give every encouragement, more elpecially by granting feus 
or long leafes, which would attach them to the place. Man, 
though a fhort-lived animal, grafps at the idea of perpetuity, 
and acts as if even his perfon were immortal.

By Mr William Haldane, Preacher of the Gofpel.</head> 



<p>Name t Situation, and Extent. 
TACHY, or ^uartachy^ is derived from the Gaelic 



fmall valley, furrounded by riling ground. The origin of 
the name Clova is uncertain. Thefe united parifb.es lie 
on the north fide of the county of Angus. The river Pro- 
fen feparates them from the parifhes of Kingoldrum and Kir- 
riemuir, on the S. and S. W. The parifh of Cortachy, from 
the extreme part on the fouth to its northern boundary on 
the Grampian hills, is about 13 miles in length. Its breadth 
varies. The north and middle parts are about 8 miles 
broad. Towards the fouth end, its breadth does not exceed 
two miles. The parifh of Clova is fituated on the north- 
weft of Cortachy, and forms part of the Grampian moun- 
tains. It is about 10 miles long, from E. to W. and 7 
broad. There is no map of the parifli ; nor has the num- 
ber of acres been afcertained.

Soil and Surface The foil of thefe united parifhes is in 

general poor, upon a cold and wettifh bottom. The haugh 
ground, on the banks of the Elk, is an open light foil, in ma- 
ny places interfperfed with, or bordering on, peat mofs. 
The greateft part of thefe parifhes is mountainous, and cal- 
culated only for pafture. The hills in Cortachy are chiefly 
covered with heath, with a fmall mixture of rough grafs a- 
long their fides. Thofe in Cloya are, in general, green, 
producing excellent grafs, and well adapted for fheep. In 
fome places the hills are deep and rocky, and almoft all of 
them abound with large whin-ftone.

Climate and Difeafes, — The air is fharp and piercing, par- 
ticularly on the high grounds. That part of the united pa- 
rifhes, which is lituated among the Grampian hills, is, in 
winter, generally covered with fnow to a great depth, which 
often is not all diffolved before the months of June and July. 
The climate is favourable to health, and many of the inha- 
bitants live to the age of 70 and 80 years. The moft pre- 
valent diftempers are rheumatifm and fevers, which are pro* 
bably occafioned by the variations of the weather. 

River, Lakes, and Fifh. — The only river in the united pa- 
rilhes is the EJk. Originating among the Grampian hills, it 
pafTes through both parifhes ; and, afttrr traverfing a courfe 
of 16 miles to the eafhvard, empties itfeif into the fea at 
Montrofe. It produces plenty of fmall trouts, but very few 
falmon ; the latter being prevented from coming up by the 
number of cruivcs in the way. The only lakes deferving no- 
tice are Loch Brandy in the parifh of Clova, and Loch Churl in 
the parifh of Cortachy. They are fituated on the north fide 
of the Efk, nigh the fummit of the Grampian hills, and are 
diftant about 2 miles from each other. On the north fide 

Vol. X. 4 G they 



Stati/lical Account 



they are bounded by a fteep rock, and on the fouth they 
have outlets which communicate with the river below. 
Their form is circular, and they are about a mile and a half 
in circumference. Thefe lakes abound with trouts of various 
fizes. 

Hills. — The hills in thefe pariflies are of a very confider- 
able height, particularly thofe in Clova, which form part of 
the Grampians. They are partly conical, and partly almoft 
perpendicular. The moft romantic are thofe fituated on the 
fouth-eaft end of the parifh of Clova, and which, on the 
north and fouth fide, encompafs a beautiful valley about 4 
miles in length, and half a mile in breadth. Here the ftu- 
penduous height of the mountain, contrafted with the de- 
lightful narrow plain below, exhibits a fcene of grandeur and 
beauty united. 

Quadrupeds and Birds. — The number of horfes is about 400, 
and of black cattle 1 200. The horfes and cattle are generally 
of a fmall fize. A horfe of 5 years old brings, in the market, 
from 7 1. to 10 I. Sterling j a cow or ox, of 4 years old, from 
4I. to 61. The number of fheep maybe about 8000 in 
fummer, but fewer in winter. They are moftly of the black 
faced kind, bought, when a year old, in the Linton markets, 
in the months of June and July, and kept for four years. 
They are fold fat about Martinmas, to butchers, at the neigh- 
bouring markets. They bring from 12s. to 16s. ahead. 
There are alfo white-faced fheep, but of a fmaller fize than 
the former. The number of fwine in the parifh is very 
fmall. The wild quadrupeds are deers, hares, and foxes. 
Of the winged tribe there are, befides tame fowl, muir fowl, 
wild ducks, partridges, and tarmacks. 



JgrictiUnre.

Agriculture. — Almoft the only cultivated part of thefe uni- 
ted parifhes, except what lies on the fouthern extremity, is 
that lying along the banks of the Elk, about 14 miles long 
and half a mile broad. The reft is hilly, or laid out for pas- 
ture. Confiderable improvement of late has been made in 
agriculture, particularly in the lower part of the parifh of 
Cortachy. Here the farmer oblerves a proper rotation in 
cropping ; and the fields, after 3 years tillage, are fown out 
with grafs feeds for 4 years. In the middle and upper dif- 
tri&amp;s of thefe united parifhes, where fheep and cattle are the 
ftaple commodity, improvement in agriculture is not fo much 
attended to ; nor is the climate fo favourable for railing corn 
as in the lower parts. If here the farmer can raile as much, 
grain as will fuffice for meal and feed, he feldom feeks far- 
ther, and trufts to his profits from fheep and cattle to pay 
his rents. The only manure on the parifh is that which is 
made by the cattle on the farms. Some farmers, for the 
fake of improvement, drive marl from the loch of Kinordy, 
in the parifh of Kirriemuir, which is about three miles dif- 
tant from the fouthern boundary of the parifh of Cortachy. 
Such of the farmers in the parifh as can procure marl, are 
enabled to bring their farms into a ftate of high cultivation, 
and to raife excellent crops ; but this fpecies of manure can. 
only be acquired by a few of them, by reafon of their great 
diftance from it. 

The Englifh plough has lately been introduced here ; but 
that chiefly ufed is the Scotch plough. The harrow and 
cart ufed are of the common conftruclionj the latter general- 
ly drawn by two horfes. A good plough cofts from 40 s. to 
50 s. •, a cart from 6 1. to 7 1. ; and a harrow about 10 s. *

Crops, Seed-time, &amp; HarveJ.—Thtk united pari flies produce 
oats, barley, peafe, flax, and potatoes. Turnips, white and red- 
clover and rye-grafs, are feldom lown, except in die vicinity of 
Cortachy, which lies on the fouthern extremity of the parilh. 
The time of fowing oats generally commences about the 24th 
of March, and ends about the 24th of April. Barley fow- 
ing begins about the 8th of May, and ends about the 24th. 
Harveft is generally begun about the middle of September, 
and concluded by the firft of November. There is little 
grain exported from this parifh even in the moft fruitful- 
feafons. The crops are feldom t'uflkient to fupport the in- 
habitants ; and often the farmers, in the upper dithricls, are 
under the necefiity of buying feed corn. Here the principal 
dependence of the farmer is on his flieep and cattle *. 

Wcod, Fuely and Minerals. — The only natural wood in the 
pariih is allar, birch, hazel, and willow, which are to be found, 
in a few places, in fin all clumps along the banks of the Elk. 
There is only one fir plantation, deferving notice, lying near

during the harveft feafon, he rarns from 20 s. to 25 s. A ma-

A taylor receives 8 d. with his maintainance ; a maid fervant, 
3 1. per annum ;. and a carpenter, including victuals, 1 s. per day. 

* The value of grain and provifions is very much regulated 
by the prices given in Kirriemuir, the neareft market town to 
this united parifh. Their value alio is according to their plen- 
ty or fcarcity ; but, on an average, the following may be con- 
fidered as the prices of grain and provifions in this parilh. Hay 
1 rings from 5' d. to 7 d. per Hone, barley from 15 s. to 16 s. per 
boll, and oats from 13 s. to 15 s. A ftone of fla* gives from 
10s. to 13s.; peafe, from 13s. to 14s. per boll; potatoes, 
horn 5 s. to 6s. The average price of beer and mutton is 3 d. 
per lib. cheefe 4 d. butter 9 d. ; the laft two articles have 27 
ounces to the pound weight. A hen is fold at 10 d. a chickca 
at 3 d. and a duck at 7 d.

Proprietors and Rent. — The Proprietors of the united pa- 
•rilhes are the Earl of Airley, and his brother the Hon. Wal- 
ter Ogilvy of Clova. 

Ecckfwjlical State. — There are two churches in the united 
parifhes ; the one in Clova, the other at Cortachy. The dis- 
tance between them is about 9 miles. Worfhip is performed 
in both on ftated Sundays. The church in Clova was rebuilt 
in the year 1730, and is capable of containing 200 perfons. 
The church of Cortachy was built about 300 years ago, and 
contains about 300 perfons. The prefent ftate of the church 
of Cortachy, {hews it to have undergone fome reparation. 
One third of it is excellent workmanfhip, being of cut ftone, 
nicely compacted ; the remaining part is coarfe, and ieems 
to be of much later date. The value of the ftipend, includ- 
ing a glebe of 6 acres, is id bolls of meal, 800 merks of mo- 
ney, and 20 merks for providing the communion elements. 
The manfe was built about 50 years ago, and has been 
frequently repaired. Mr Charles Gordon, ordained in 
February 1774, is now minifter of the united pariflies. The 
family of Airley are patrons. 

School and Poor. — The parochial fchool was rebuilt in the 
year 1785. The fchoolmafter's falary is 100 merks, with a 
houfe and garden. The number of fcholars in winter is be- 
tween 50 and 60, but much fewer in fummer. The fees 
for teaching are 1 s. per quarter for Englilh \ is. 6 d. for 
writing, and 2 s. for arithmetic. The Latin language is not 
taught. The value of the office, including the emoluments 
arifing from the dues of baptifms, certificates of marriages, 
and feffion-clerk's fees, may be eftimated at 17I. Sterling.

■whence the poor are fupplied. 

General CharaBer, CSV. — The inhabitants are frugal and 
induftnous, and enjoy, in a reafonable degree, the comforts 
and advantages of fociecy. They are not fond of a military

(County of Roxburgh.— Prejhytery of Kelfo.— Synod of 
Merfe and Tiviotdale.J 

By DoBor Christopher Douglas, Phyfcian in Kelfo.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THIS diftridt, formerly tonfifting of three feparate pa- 
rities, viz. Kelfo, Maxwell, and St- James's, is fituated 
in the lower divifion of Roxburghshire or Tiviotdale, in N. 
lat. 55 0 . 36'. in W. long, i°. 20V It is of an irregular tri- 
angular figure, extending in length, from N. to S. 44. miles, 
and in breadth, from E. to W. 4| miles. It contains from 
5000 ro 6occ acres. On the E. the parifh of Sprouflon iepa- 
rates it from Northumberland. The rivers Tweed and Ti- 
viot unite at Kelfo. The former divides the parifh nearly 
into two equal parts. St. James's lies between the two rivers ; 
Maxwell on the S. E. and Kelfo on the N. and W. of both. 

Rent and Proprietors. — The valued rent is 15,300!. Scotch. 
The real rent, including the land in pofTeffion of the proprie- 
tors, which is by far the greateft part of the parifh, is from 
7000 1. to 8000 1. Sterling. The land, in this part of the 
country, is all meafured by the Englifh acre. It lets at 2 1. 
3 1. 4 1. and fometimes 5 1. per acre, and little or none, even 
in the remote part of the parifh, under 15 s. The Duke of 

Rox- 



of Kelfo. ^jj 

Roxburgh, fuperior of the town and the greateft part of the 
parilh, refides above half the year at Fleurs. Befides his Grace, 
the following heritors alfo refide in the parilh ; Sir George 
Douglas, Bart. Rear-Admiral William Dickfon, Robert Da- 
vidfon of Pinnacle-hill, Robert Walker of Wooden, John 
Proctor of Softlaw Tower, Efcjs; Capt. Scott of Rofebank, 
Rev. Dr Panton, Dr Blaw, and many others of fmaller 
property. 

Sci/ t Agriculture, and Produce. — The foil of this parilh, 
for a confiderable tract on both fides of the river Tweed, 
and in that part of it which lies between the Tweed and 
the Tiviot, is in general compofed of a deep rich loam, 
upon a bottom of gravel ; from its favourable lituation, and 
the culture it receives, it produces early and luxuriant crops. 
Towards the N. W. extremity of the parilh, the foil is a 
wet clay ; in the S. it is in general thin and wet, and the 
bottom is a red clay ; here the crops are generally three 
weeks later than in the vicinity of the rivers. About 20 
years ago, it was a common practice to divide the cultivated 
land into fix equal parts, each of which,. in regular fuccellion, 
got a fummer fallowing, and all the dung that the farm pro- 
duced, lime being then Ibidem ufed in agriculture. The 
crop immediately after the fallow was always wheat, the le- 
cond barley, the third oats, the fourth peale, and the fifth 
oats or wheat ; after thefe crops it was often laid out into 
paft ure, fometimes fallowed again. By this management the 
lands were always foul, fo that the crops, excepting the firft, 
and fometimes the fecond, were moftly poor. But lime hav- 
ing of late been very generally employed as a manure, and 
turnips, potatoes, and fown grafies introduced along with it, 
the following rotation is adopted with fuccefs through the

whole parifli. The land in tillage is divided into four equal 
parts, one of which is fown with turnips, or planted with 
potatoes ; for both, the land muft be carefully cleaned and 
pulveriled, as well as manured. The common practice is to 
fow turnips on ridges 30 inches wide, and the feafon molt 
proper for this is, from the 10th to the end of June; when 
fown earlier, they are apt to {hoot in autumn; and, if 
later, they feldom grow to a large fize. Potatoes are planted 
from the middle to the end of April, in ridges 30 inches 
afunder. The fucceeding crop is either barley or fpring 
wheat, which is thought by many to anfwer as well as when, 
fown in autumn ; the third hay, and the fourth oats or wheat, 
unlefs the land has been laid down for pafture, in which cafe 
a fourth of the old grafs land is ploughed up, and fown with 
cats ; fometimes the third crop is peafe inftead of hay, but 
this practice is every day lefs prevalent. By this mode of 
cultivation, the crops are good, the land kept clean and rich, 
and at an expence comparatively fmall. Upon fome fields 
©f a clay foil, the management is a fummer fallow, with the 
following rotation of crops, firft wheat, fecond peafe or 
beans, third barley, fourth oats ; and upon very poor hnd 
of this kind, when tpo wet for turnips, and too wet as well 
as too weak for wheat, after a fummer fallow the firft crop 
is wheat, the fecond hay, and the third, if not left for pas- 
ture, oats. A confiderable part of this parifli is kept in 
grafs, and paftured with ftieep and black cattle ; but as moft 
of the fields are let for a fummer pafture only, it is impof. 
fible to afcertain the number of flieep and cattle, that are fat- 
tened in the parifli upon grafs and turnips during the year. 
It is however well known, that, owing to the high price of 
Wool, and the conftant demand for fheep and cattle, both

better for many years paft *. 

Bridges.— At Kelfo there is an elegant bridge over the 
Tweed, confifting of fix beautiful arches, built in the year 
1756, by a fubfcription from the county at large, but parti- 
cularly by the inhabitants of this parifh of every denomina- 
tion, who diftinguifhed themfelves by their liberality. An 
aft of Parliament has lately paffed, for building a bridge 
over the Tiviot, a little above its junction with the Tweed, 
Which will make a free communication With the weft part of 
the county, much wanted, and likely to prove, in many re- 
fpefts, highly advantageous to the public. 

Antiquitits. — A confiderable part of the Abbey of Kel- 
fo f, formerly an immenfe edifice, ftill remains, and exhibits 
a venerable monument of that tafte for magnificence, which 

diftin- 

* The common hire of a labourer, per day, is from 1 s. to 
16 d. but, in hay time and harveft, from i6d. to 20 d. Male 
fervants, maintained in the houfe, receive from 6 to 8 guineas 
yearly; women, from 3I. to 4I. 10 s, Moft of the men fer- 
vants, however, are hired as hinds. Their wages, at an avenge, 
amount to ■ 8,1. a year. A great part of the fummer work, 
fuch as hay-making, hoeing of turnips, potatoes, &amp;c. is per- 
formed by young girls, who, being early accuftomed to ufe the 
hoe, are more expert at this work thai, the men. They receive 
from 4d. to 8 d. and country mafons and carpenters, from 16 d. 
to 22 d. per day, without victuals. 

f The Abhey of Kelfo was built by St David, king of 
Scotland : He had a predilection for an order of monks called 
Tyronenfes, whom he firft planted at Selkirk ; but not think- 
ing it an eligible fituation for his favourites, he foon re- 
moved them to Roxburgh, (in r 1 26), and at lalt tranfl.ued 
them to Kelfo, where he, in 1 128, founded for them a magni- 
ficent church, and other buildings in the Saxon Rile. This ab- 
bey was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evan-

diftinguifhed antient times. But, while it contributes to the 
ornament of the furrounding country, and the pleafure of 

fpecta- 

gelift : Its privileges were very confiderable, and its endow, 
ments liberal. The monks were exempted from toll, and leave 
■was granted to them and the abbot, to receive the facraments 
■of the church from any bilhop they pleafed, in Scotland and 
Cumberland. The abbot was allowed to wear a mitre, to 
make ufe of other pontifical diflincVions, and to be prefent at all 
genenil councils. It is related, that this order was particular- 
ly attentive to agriculture, and that, befides hufbandmcn, they 
maintained within their monaftery all kinds ol mechanics, 
whofe profits were depofited in the common (lock, for the fup- 
port of the order. If this was the cafe, David (hewed good 
fenfe and reafon, in patronizing an order of men, who promoted' 
the improvement of the arts, as well as the intefefts of religion, 
in an age when fcience and philofophy, feebly, if at all, illu- 
minated the kingdom. Small fragments of pillars, antique (tones, 
Itatues, &amp;c. evidently belonging to the abbey, have been found 
at different times, and fome of them are iiill to be feen at a 
confiderable dillance from the fabric, affording a lively, though 
melancholy emblem of the all-fubduing power of time. 

The church of St. James's was fituated between the rivers 
Tweed and Tiviot, near to Roxburgh Caftle, and on the veiy 
ipot on which the greateft fair in this country, as well as one 
of the mod antient, called St James's Fair, is now held. Tiiis 
church was dedicated, anno 1 1 34. No part of it remains above 
ground, but the place where it (food is perfe/lly obvious. The 
Duke of Roxburgh, a 'few years ago, employed labourers to 
trace the foundation. While carrying on this work, they dug 
up a tomb-Rone, which had been erefled to the memory of 
Johanna Bullock. It was pretty entire ; and, befides fome 
elegant Popiih fculptiire, had the following infcription in Saxon 
characters, Hie jacct Johanna Bullock, quae obiit anno 1 37 1. 
Orate pro annua ejus. Hiftorians mention a William Bullock, 
a favourite with Edward Baliol, and generally (tiled the 
King's beloved Clerk. As this name is feldom found in Scot- 
land, it is piobable that Johanna Bullock was the daughter, 
or a near relation, of this eminent perfon, efpecially as he fre- 
cpuently refided at Roxburgh Caftle. There was al£b found a 
confiderable quantity of wheat and barley, in a charred (late, 
fcattered on a tiled pavement ; as were alfo feveral pieces of 
elafs and brick, which fhewed obvious marks of fire. All thefe

fpedTators, it, at the fame time, recalls the mortifying re- 
membrance of that rudenefs and barbarity, with which neigh- 
bouring kingdoms carried on hoftilities againft each other,, 
The venerable appearance of this ruin is marred, by the ad- 
dition of an aile built in the laft century, for the accommo- 
dation of the family of Roxburgh, when part of the building 
was ufed for the parifh church. This uncouth modern ad- 
dition entirely fhuts up one very large arch, and the half of 
another, befides 7 of a fmaller fize above; but from the va- 
lue which the Duke of Roxburgh puts upon it as a ruin ; 
and from his defire to preferve it in its priftine ftate, there is 
much caufe to hope, that we mail foon fee this modem build- 
ing levelled with the ground,, and the genuine antient re- 
mains fecured from injury by an inclofure. It has not, like 
molt of the Gothic buildings, any minutenefs of ornament, 
but has a tendency, by its plainnefs and magnitude, to in- 
fpire the mind with the grand and the fublime, rather than 
the pleafing and beautiful. 

Roxburgh Castle * ftands upon an eminence of con- 

fiderable 

circumftances render it probable, that this church was burnt 
down in fome of the border wars. 

At a fmall diftance from this church, flood a convent of 
mendicants of the order of St. Francis, on the north bank 
of the river Tiviot, a little above its confluence with the Tweed. 
Within thefe few years, a fine arch of their church remained, 
and other parts of the building, which are now almoll wholly 
effaced. This monaftery was confecrated by William Bifhop of 
Glafgow, in the year 1235. — In the parifh of Maxwell, fouth 
of the Tiviot, and nearly opp fite to Roxburgh Caflie, ftood 
Maifin Z)/f«,an afylum for pilgrims, thedifeafed, and the indigent. 
The fite of this houfe is well knows ; and upon the very fpoc 
where it ftood there flill remains a village, bearing the antient 
name. The guardian of this houfe, Nichol de Chapelyn^ 
did homage to Edward I. of England anno 1296.

fiderable extent, and is furrounded with a deep trench, ftill 
vifible, which the garrifon could fill with water at pleafure, 
and over which a draw bridge was placed. The wall which 
furrounded the fortrefs is in a great meafure deftroyed, but 
fome parts of it ftill remain pretty entire, which difplay a- 
mazing llrength from their thicknefs and folidity. — Upon Mr 
Walker's eftate at Wooden, there are the veitiges of a Ro- 
man tumulus *. There are alfo feveral of the fame kind* in 

different 

poflefflon of this fortrefs, render its hiftory of more importance 
than that of any near the borders. It frequently changed maf- 
ters ; and, in the reign of Henry VI. was in the pcfllflion of 
that monarch. James II. of Scotland having laid fiege to it, 
his army made themfelves mafters of the Caftle, in a great 
meafure deftroyed the works, and reduced it to ruins ; but, pre- 
vious to the victory, the king was killed by the burftjng of a 
piece of ordnance. A holly tree is faid to ftand on the fpot 
where this happened, on the north fide of the river Tweed, and" 
a little below Fleurs houfe. Near this tree flood a large village, 
which, from a crofs that remained within thefe few years, was ge- 
nerally called the Fair Crofs. But the probable origin of the name, 
as it has been handed down, though not generally known, is this : 
James IPs Queen, having very foon reached the fpot where 
the lifelefs body of her hufband lay, is reported to have ex- 
claimed, ' There lies the fair corpft" whereupon it received 
the name of Fair Corpfe or Corf ; and, in procefs of time, the 
change from corfe to crofs was eafily effected. The Queen, 
foon after this fatal accident, obferving that the army was dif- 
heartened, and that the chiefs were for raifing the fiege, ufed 
every means to excite their courage, and, among other things, 
told them, that although their king had fallen, he was but one 
man, and that fhe would foon give them another king, her fon 
James III. who next day arrived in the camp, and was crown- 
ed in Kelfo in the 7th year of his age. This heroic and well 
timed addrefs, produced the defired effect ; the fpirits of the 
whole army were roufed ; and, renewing the attack with re- 
doubled ardor, the garrifon furrendered in a few days. From 
this period the Caftle has remained in ruins, although it was in 
fome degree repaired, by the Lord Protector, Somerfet, in the 
reign of Edward VI.

of Cairns. 



PiBurefque Scenery. — The variety of charming profpccts, 
which this part of the country exhibits, renders it a difficult 
tafk to felect any of them. The views, however, prefented 
from the caftle of Roxburgh and the Fleurs, deferve parti- 
cular notice ; but to attempt an enumeration of their beau- 
ties, were to no purpofe ; for to be in any degree conceived, 
they muft be feen. The fcene which appears from Kelfo 
bridge, and has often called forth the powers of the painter, 
partakes fo much of the pidturefque and elegant, that it ex- 
cites the admiration of every lpectator. From this the tgwn 
is feen, with the majeftic ruins of the ancient abbey, and the 
handfome modern fabric of i,dnam houfe ; at no great dis- 
tance to the north- weft, the lofty building of Fleurs; be- 
tween the rivers, the remains of Roxburgh caftle ; near to this 
Springwood-park; towards the eaft, Pinnacle-hill and Wood- 
en ; at the diftance of a few miles, the Eildon hills rifing in

of Stichell, and of Mellerftain ; add to thefe, the winding 
courfe of the rivers, before their junction, with an ifland in 
each ; one of thefe, and the banks of both rivers, covered 
with beautiful wood ; the fteep precipices of Maxwell, and 
Chalk-heugh, and a variety of other fine objects. All thefe

'Town of Kelso. — Kelfo, anciently, Calchow, Kelkow, 
or dc Calco, is fituated on the river Tweed, in an extenfive 
plain, bounded on all fides by gently rifing grounds, covered 
with fine foreft trees, forming a mod beautiful amphitheatre. 
Its fituation is particularly taken notice of by Patten, who 
accompanied the Lord Protector, Somerfet, into Scotland, 
arid who calls it a pretty market town. 

During the border wars, which long fpread defolation and 
mifery over this country, Kelfo was thrice burnt down by 
the Englifh : It was alfo reduced to afhes, in the year 1686, 
by an accidental fire ; and nearly fo by another, about 50 
years ago. At prelent, it is a handfome town, containing 
many good houfes, with a fpacious market place 300 feet in 
length, and 200 in breadth ; from hence, as a centrical point, 
proceed four long ftreets, and two confiderable lanes. In 
the fquare (lands the town houfe, the principal houfes, and 
fhops, many of which would do no difcredit to the capital 
,of any country. 

Name. — Kelfo is probably derived from the word Calx. This 
conjecture feems the more probable, from an eminence on 
Tweed fide, on which part of the town ftands. This height 
is called the Chalk-heugh, or Calchow, one of the ancient 
names of the town, and contains a great quantity of Gyp- 
fum, and other calcareous matters ; all which, in the Celtic 
language, were denominated Kelk, hence Kelkon ; and the 
Monks denominated the feal of the ancient monaftery, Si- 
gillum Monafterii de Calco. This eminence alfo affords a 
delightful profpect, which, by fome, is thought to eclipfc 
that from the bridge. 

Government 



of Kelfo. 585 

t 

Government of the Town. — The Duke of Roxburgh, as lay 
proprietor of the lands and abbey of Kelfo, is Lord of the 
Manor. His Grace's anceftor, Sir Robert Ker of Cefsford, 
obtained this grant from James I. of England, anno 1605, 
on the forfeiture of Edward Earl of Bothwell, Admiral of 
Scotland, when it was probably made a burgh of barony. 

Kelfo is governed by a Baron Bailie, appointed by the 
Duke, and fifteen ftent-mafters, of whom the Duke nomi- 
nates feven. The other eight confifts of the Prefes of the 
Merchant Company, a Deacon Convener, the Deacons of 
the five following Corporations, Hammermen, Skinners, 
Shoemakers, Taylors, Weavers, and the Deacon of the But- 
chers, although they are not incorporated. The ftent-ma- 
fters, under the authority of the Baron Bailie, are entrufted 
with the power of impofing a ftent or tax upon the inhabi- 
tants, as they judge their circumftances may afford. This is 
levied for the purpofe of fupplying the inhabitants with water, 
conveyed by leaden pipes, to different parts of the town, 
for repairing the ftreets, keeping the town clock in order, 
paying part of the fchoolmafter's falaries, and for feveral o- 
ther incidents. 

Sefts and Religious Houfes. — Befides the effablifhed church, 
and an Epifcopal chapel, there are a number of feels, each 
of which has a houfe for public worfhip, and fome of them 
are even elegant. Thefe are the kirk of Relief, Burghers, 
Antiburghers, Cameronians, Methodifts, and Quakers. There 
are three Roman Catholics,' and one Jew in the parilh. The 
major part of the inhabitants, particularly of the genteel 
clafs, attend the parifh church, and Epifcopal chapel. The 
meeting-houfes are chiefly fupported by inhabitants of diffe- 
rent parifhes in the vicinity. This place, being centrical and 
convenient, induces them to build here. The Parochial

church and Epifcopal chapel are both new ; the former, 
a fpacious od~hgon, with a handfome dome, and conftrudted 
to accomodate three thoufand hearers ; the latter, a fmall 
neat gothic building, and has lately been ornamented with 
an organ. 

Population. — In the year 1749, the number of inhabitants 
was 2900. The return from Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 
2781, and the number at prefent amounts to 4324. The 
annexed table contains an exact ftatement of the number of

The difproportion between the average number of each fa- 
mily of the town and country, is owing to the number of 
widows and Angle women, who live more conveniently in 
the town, and get employment more readily than in the 
country. In 38 years, the increafe of inhabitants has been 
1543. This great increafe may, in part, be accounted for, 
from the deftrudn'on of many villages in the neighbourhood, 
occupied by fmall farmers and mechanics. From the en- 
largement of the farms, many were obliged to follow other 
trades, and Kelfo being the metropolis of the diftricl, they 
flocked there for habitations and employment •, and, in pro- 
portion as labourers and mechanics have become fewer in 
the country, Kelfo increafed in population. 

Fairs, Markets, Manufactures, Isfc. — The weekly market 
day is Friday. There are twelve high markets in the year, 
two before and one after the term days of Whitfunday and 
Martinmas j the two firft are for hiring male and female fer- 
vants •, the laft is generally employed by the fervants in 
mirth, and in laying out their wages before they enter again

into fervice. On.thefe days, the concourfe of people being great, 
and beyond what is known on the like occafions in any part of 
Scotland, it is productive of immenfe profits to the mopkeep- 
ers, milliners, &amp;c. among whom they lay out incredible futns 
of money, principally for wearing apparel, and female orna- 
ments. The other fix high market days are in March and 
the end of autumn ; the former for purchafing horles for 
fummer work, fuch as, driving lime, coal, &amp;c. ; which be- 
ing over, they fell the horfes again beiore winter fets in, 
owing to the high price of fod.ler al this feafon. 

There are three fairs in the parilh, including St. James's, 
which is held on the 5th of Augult j two in the town, one 
of thefe on the 10th of July, the other on the 2d of No- 
vember. When thefe fairs were eftabhl'hed, they were wife- 
ly defigned ; the firft was for buying lean cattle, to be fed 
during the fummer and autumn months, upon ueadow and 
pafture ground j and, when fat, they were brougnt to market, 
and fold for winter and fpring food, called Marts, being im- 
mediately killed and falted. In thefe days, frelh meat was 
not to be got during winter ; but, fince the introduction of 
turnip hufbandry, the market is plentifully fuppiied with the 
very beft fed cattle during the whole year, i he fummer 
fair being no longer of its original ufe, it would be a great 
advantage to the ftockholders, to have it altered to the end 
of Auguft ; this would fuit dealers in cattle to purchale, at a 
convenient time, to drive them fouth to Woolpitt market, 
held in September. Fairs ought to fucceed one another from 
north to fouth, until ftocks arrive in London, the ne plus 
ultra. The great concourfe of people, of all defcriptions,

whence the inhabitants derive their fupport ; but, of all o-

who come here in great numbers to fell immenfe quantities

of grain, particularly wheat, all by the fample. They are 
a moft relpeclable body. Their farms, advanced to the moll 
perfect ftate of cultivation, (hew, that, in ingenuity and in- 
duftry, they are not inferior to the farmers of any other 
country ; and with refpett to depth of information and 
liberality of fentiment, they ought to be efteemed what they 
really are, a focicty of independent country gentlemen. 

Articles of Trade. — The fliopkeepers, who are the moft 
refpe&amp;able clafs of traders, deal to a great extent, in all 
kinds of woollen drapery, haberdafhery, hofiery goods, gro. 
ceries, and hard wares ; and have likewife a great demand 
for various kinds of grafs feeds. Thefe different articles 
amount to a great fum ; but, from the difficulty of afcer- 
taining it, I forbear giving a ftatement ; it may, however, 
be curious and interefting to mention the quantities of ex- 
cifeable wines, fpirits, &amp;c. confumed yearly in Kellb, and 
the adjacent country, exclufive of what is commiffioned by 
people of the higher rank, from wine merchants at a dif- 
tance.

Upon an average, they kill annually,

The Ikinners drefs from 70 to 80000 fheep and lamb

the wool of 40 or 50000 mort fkins. Thefe are, the fkins 
of lambs, either brought forth dead, or which die early. 
They likevvife collect and fend away above 5000 hare lkins*. 
The fhoemakers, by far the moft numerous clafs, make an- 
nually 30,000 pair of fhoes, and from 3 to 400 pair of boots. 
Thefe are all fold at different fairs in Northumberland, and 
in Kelfo market. The high wages the journeymen receive, 
and the price of leather, precludes matters from the benefit 
of exportation. . 

The weavers yearly make about 20,000 yards of flannel, 
or what are locally called, plains ; and from 9 to 10,000 of 
different kinds of linen, which they call cuftom work. 
Stocking weavers work annually from 3 to 400 dozen of 
pairs. Dyers and clothiers are principally employed in dy- 
ing, and dreffing, what they call country work, made by in- 
dividuals for private ufe, in pieces from 50 to 60 yards in

vate wearing. The copper and white-iron fmiths, fell every

* It is but juftice, due to merit, to make particular mention 
of John Gibson optician in Kelfo, as a man of genius, who 
has made feveral improvements in optical inflxuments. His 
rectifying telefcopes fhew objects very diftinctly, by rendering 
them brighter, and more free from tremors, than any we have 
feen. This arifes partly from the compofition of the fpecula, 
all of which he cafts himfelf, and partly from the correct figure 
and bighpolifh he gives them. He has invented a reflecting microf- 
cope, which fhews minute objects, with much greater exactnefs, 
than any made upon the refracting principle. The conftruction 
of it is very fimple, and it is eafily managed, and adapted to fhow 
both opaque and tranfparent objects, which can be applied to 
it with much facility. He has been equally fuccefsful in the 
execution and improvement of the achromatic telefcopes. He 
obferved, that, in the heft of thefe inttruments, fome of the co- 
lours were not corrected, and found that it lay in the principle : 
for, on examining the nature of the crown and flint glafs, of 
which they are made, he difcovered, that the diftance of the 
colours, in the oblong images, formed by prifms, made of thefe 
kinds of glafs, were not fimilar ; and, therefore, that all the 
different coloured rays, could not be united in the fame point. 
Whether, by ufing flint glafs of a different compofition, or by 
fome other device, we know not ; but he has not only over- 
come this error in the principle, but likewife that arifing from 
the fpherical figure of the compound lens. Some of his telef- 
copes, 4* feet in length, with triple object glalfes, bear, with 
the greateft: diflinctnefs, a magnifying power of more than 240 
times, Thefe telefcopes he makes of four different lengths, 
one foot, two, three, four and a half feet, and mounts them 
either in Aiding tubes or on ftands, by which they are fitted for 
aftronomical purpofes.

kinds ; and, upon the whole, at a cheap rate, confidering 
the diftance from the fea, but, as the price varies much, no

the mouth of the river ; they gradually lefTen in value, as 
they become more diftant from the fea. 

Eccleftajlical State, Schools, and Poor. — The ftipend is, in 
money and victual, 100 guineas, per annum, exclufive of a 
houfe and garden, and a valuable glebe, meafuring between 
fix and feven acres. It is worthy of remark, that, during 
this century, there have been but two incumbents, Mr Ram- 
fay, and the prefent much efteemed and worthy paftor, Mr 
Cornelius Lundie. 

There are two eftablifhed fchools, one for Latin, and the 
other for Englifh. The tutor has a falary of 22I. per an- 
num, a houfe and garden, and 5s. per quarter for each of 
his pupils. He has about 50 fcholars. The office of fef- 
fion-clerk, is generally annexed to his employment, which 
is worth about 1 2I. a year. The Englifh matter's falary is 
5I. 13s.; 2s. 6d. and 3s. 66. per quarter from his pupils; 
the firft for being taught reading ; the fecond reading and 
writing ; and the third arithmetic, in addition to the other

two. His fcholars are from 100 to 130. There are alfo four 
other Englifh fchools, one of them taught by the clerk of rhe 
chapel, and in good reputation. Belides thefe, there are 
female teachers, for inftru&amp;ing girls in fewing. A recent in- 
ftitution, which does credit to the founders, and which, it 
is hoped, will turn out to their advantage, and to that of the 
public in general, is a Jchool of indufry, in which employ- 
ment is given to poor girls, who have ftated hours for few- 
ing, knitting, and tambouring, for learning to read and write, 
and for inculcating moral duties. 

In the year 1782, there were 57 penfioners on the poor's- 
roll i in April 1702, their number amounted to 92, of whom 
23 were men, 48 women, and 2 1 children. Their weekly 
allowance came to 5 1. 6 s. 5 d. of which the heritors paid 
3 1. 14 s. 6 d. and the town 1 1. 3 s. 7 d. ; the balance was 
made up by part of the money arifing from charitable le- 
gacies. 

Births and Deaths — The births amount to about 200 an- 
nually, but, owing to the number of duTenters from the efta- 
blifhcd church, and others who neglect to regifter their 
baptifms, it is impoffible to afcertain the number. Surely 
the fmall tax for regiftration, which may in future be of ef. 
fential conlequence to the children, and of prefent informa- 
tion to the public, ought to be enforced. — For five years fuc- 
cefiively, the deaths, upon an average, amounted to 134, fo 
that only one out of 32 die in the year. 

Climate and Difenfes. — Eafterly winds, accompanied with 
froft, fleet, and moifture, prevail here, as well as upon the 
whole eaft coaft, for three or four months in the year. They 
produce intermitting fevers, rheumatifm, and other febrile

alFeftions, and never fail to aggravate the complaints of va- 
letudinarians ; yet, from the very favourable fituation of the 
town, their baneful effects are lefs felt here, than in any other 
fpot in the country. There is no fituation in the north 
where the climate is fo mild ; which the author has obferved 
when travelling fouth in the fpring, when the foliage of the 
hedges and trees was more advanced about Kelfo, than in 
any fituation north of York. 

It is true that the climate becomes colder in proportion as 
one afcends from thje Tweed, lb much fo, that at a mile or 
two fouth or north from Kellp, a confiderable change is felt 
in the air, and ftrongly marked in the progrefs of vegeta- 
tion. 

However healthy the people are in this parilh, which is 
obvious from thofe proportion the advanced in life, bear to the 
whole number, and from only I in 32 dying annually, yet 
many of the young and beautiful fall victims to confump- 
tions, and other fcrophulous affections. Thele difeafes are 
frequent over all the north of England and fouth of Scot- 
land. This may in part be owing to the prevailing cold 
eaft winds obftructing perfpiration ; to the conftant vicifii- 
tude of weather, to which our infular fituation fubjects us ; 
and to the inhabitants not paying due attention to their 
clothing, nor to their perfons, in point of cleanlinefs. Tneir 
diet, though chiefly farinaceous, and efteemed wholefome, 
from the quantity which the labouring clafs ufe daily, may 
be one caufe of laying the foundation of glandular and vif- 
ceral difeafes. Although the mechanics in town generally 
eat meat for dinner, the labourers in town and country fel. 
dom do fo ; but one and all of them live much upon hafty 
pudding, and boiled potatoes with milk ; without deviation, 
they all breakfaft or fup upon the one or the other. Moll 
of the adults eat of this food, at a meal, from 6 to 3 Englilh 

pounds 



o/ Kelfo. 



595 



pounds weight, including milk ; children in proportion^ 
Surely this amazing quantity of food mult injure the tone of 
the ftomach, and, from the air let loofe in digeftion, to what 
an immenfe magnitude may it not be diftended, by which 
the whole chylopoetic vifcera muft be much oppreffed. 
Hence flatulency and indigeftion arife, which is foon follow- 
ed by bad concocted chyle, which gradually debilitates the 
fyftem, and is followed by glandular affections, eafily obferv- 
ed in the large bellies of children, owing to the mefenteric 
glands being obflructed. Other fcrophulous fymptoms gra- 
dually fucceed, and tubercles being formed in the lungs, ul- 
timately produce confumptions. The fame caufes, which ex- 
cite pulmonary affections in the young, lay the foundation 
for vifceral obftructions in the more advanced in life. This 
is obvious from the ftate of Kelfo Diipehlary. Laft year 
there were 604 medical patients admitted Upon that chanty, 
out of thefe 236 were affected with one or other of thefe 
complaints. In 27 deaths (the number reported for the 
year) 1 8 died of thefe difeafes ; and Without doubt there were 
many more, whofe deaths not being intimated to the govern 
nor, could not be publifhed in the fiatement. 

A fcrophulous affection often remains dormant in the 
fyftem for years ; and Were it rtot for exciting caufes which 
produce inflammation in the glands, many would live to Old 
age, who now fall victims to this difeafe ; thefe are, fevere 
labour, fudden change from vegetable to animal food, the 
too frequent ufe of fpirituous liquors, expofure to cold, 
which fuddeniy obftrue'ts perfpiration, particularly after fuch 
exercifes as accelerate the circulation of the blood, and de- 
termine to the lungs, as running, leaping, dancing, &amp;c. 

Excepting difeafes peculiar to children, epidemics feldom 
of never prevail in Kelfo. About 4 years ago, a putrid fe- 
ver was introduced by a patient from the country} it fpread, 

and

and proved fatal to many. The weather at the time was 
warm, and the air moift - t but it would not probably have 
proved fo baneful, had proper attention been paid to clean, 
mg the gutters of the (trcets, and to cleanlinefs in general. 
The greateft part of the town fiands upon a level, it there- 
fore requires particular attention, to prevent water and filth 
of every kind from ftagnating. This ftigma is by no means 
more applicable to the inhabitants of Kelfo, than to the north 
in general. Did they but know what a fames for difcafe un- 
cleanlinefs produces, they would inftantly follow the exam- 
ple ot their fouthern neighbours, who, as a late author ob- 
ferves, are now as remarkable for that particular attention 
to cleanlinefs, as they were two centuries ago tor the contra- 
ry extreme. Tc the laft cauie, the frequent vifitation of the 
plague has been often attributed ; for ever fince they became 
cleanly in their perfons, houfes, and ftreets, this dreadful 
dileafe has not once appeared among them. 

Mifcellaneous Qbfervations. — The uncommon fertility of 
this count i y affording all the neceffaries of life in abundance, 
and at a moderate price, its population,, and the amazing 
number of fheep, bred upon the Cheviot and Lammerrnuir 
hills, whole wool and (kins are lent to the moft diflant parts 
of the lfland, are circumftances fo peculiarly favourable to 
manufactures, that one is naturally led to expect, that here 
they muft be eftabliflied and flourith ; yet hitherto, unfor- 
tunately, none of any conftquence has been inftituted, the 
Kelfo plains being the only one ever attempted, and even 
this does not increafe. In general, this is fuppofed to be 
owing to the diftance,and high price of coals. This opinion, 
however, leems not to be altogether- well founded, as in ma- 
ny Englifh manufacturing towns, and even in Hawick and 
Galalhiels, the one 20, and the other only 16 miles from 

Kelfo, 



of Kelfo* £gp 

Kelfo, coal is brought from a much greater diftance, and fold 
at a higher price, than in Kelfo, yet in thefe towns they 
flourifh, and are carried on to a confiderable extent ; but 
although the demand were greater than it really is, if the 
roads leading to the coal hills were kept in proper repair, 
that necefTary article would undoubtedly be procured at a 
much eafier rate. It has been obferved, that, in countries 
where agriculture is carried to fuch a degree of perfection as 
in this, manufactures are little if at all attended to. This 
may be accounted for in part, from the thirft of mankind 
after riches. Our farmers being by far the moft opulent 
and profperous clafs in the community, this naturally induces 
men of wealth to lay out their money in hufbandry, per- 
fuaded that in this way they have the beft reafon to look for 
a certain and fpeedy return. But were manufactures efta- 
blifhed, they would foon exhibit another great fource of 
wealth, and both jwould equally affift and derive advantage 
from each other. 

The higher clafs of inhabitants in this p2rifh are courteous 
in their manners, liberal in their fentiments, and benevolent 
in their difpofitions. A public library, which has exifled 
upwards of forty years, and can now boaft of a collection of 
the beft modern authors, being regularly fupplied with every 
publication of merit ; together with- a coffee-houfe fupplied 
with the London, Edinburgh, and Kelfo newfpapers, have 
contributed to render them not lels intelligent than agree- 
able. The proprietors of the library have lately refolved to 
erect a neat elegant houfe for the books, and for the accom- 
modation of the librarian. 

Many of the inhabitants have formed themfelves into three 
different focieties, the members paying a certain fum weeklv, 
for the purpofe of maintaining any of their number who 
may be fick j in cafes of death, for defraying funeral ex- 

pences, 



598

pences, and giving a fmall annuity to their widows. Could 
focieties like thefe be made general, they would fuperfede 
poors rates, and would afford to the indigent themfelves, a 
much better fubgftence than they can obtain from the o- ' 
ther. 

It is much to be regretted, that the elegant fquare in which 
the market is held, is not ornamented with a better town- 
houfe. The prefent is old and ruinous, and, from its con- 
firuction, the receptacle of filth, and the harbour of va- 
gabonds, who here lay theur plans of depredation, which are 
too frequent among the idle and low clais of whifky compa- 
nions. 

There is no fatisfaclion which renders the pofleffion of 
riches more agreeable, than the power it gives the pofTefibrs 
of applying part to alleviate the diftreffes of the indigent. 
This country has happily many fuch, among whom the Hon. 
Mrs Baillie of Jervifwood appears moft confpicuous. About 
17 years ago, upon her fuggefting the utility of a Dilpenfary, 
for the relief of the difeafed among the lower orders of peo- 
ple, of all the parilhes on both lides of the borders ; the 
opulent, with a readinefs that does equal credit to their ho- 
nour and feelings, heartily concurred with her in advancing 
a fum more than fufficient for its immediate eftablilhment, 
and providing for its lupport by an annual fublcription. 
They have now a handlome convenient building, where the 
patients receive advice and medicines, and a Ipacious ward, 
to accommodate 12 patients who may ftand in need of chi- 
rurgical affiftance. The fubfcribers have now the latisfac- 
tion to fee their funds yearly increafe ; and alfo the agree- 
able reflection of having contributed to the comfort and re- 
lief of between 8000 and 9000 perlons, no lefs by prevent- 
ing their running in debt to apothecaries, than by the medi- 
cal affiftance they have received.

It is matter of ferious regret to every perfon of feeling 
and reflection, it ftrikes ftrangers with furprife, and imprefles 
no favourable opinion of the inhabitants, that the church- 
yard, from being uninclofed, fhould have a number of roads 
running through it ; and that it fhould be covered with the 
ikins of animals^ which the fkinners take the liberty of dry- 
ing upon it ; and, owing to the fame caufe, there is nothing 
to prevent even fwine from turning up the graves. The 
refpect which mankind, in all ages and countries, whether 
refined or barbarous, have uniformly paid to the afhes of 
their anceftors, fhould of itfelf be a fufficient motive to in- 
duce the heritors and inhabitants to concur in inclofing it, 
and by this means to prevent ftrangers from entertaining 
fentiments and fufpicions of them, for which no other part 
•f their conduft can afford the leaft foundation.

<name ref="NA">SOUTRA</name>. 

(Counties of Mid and Eajl-Lothian. — Prefbytery of 
Dalkeith. — Synod of Lothian and T weeddale J. 

By the Rev. Mr Archibald Singers, Mtntfter.</head> 



<p>Situation? Extent, Surface, and Profpetl. 

THE parifh of Fala lies partly in Mid, and partly in 
Eaft Lothian. Its greateft breadth, from north to 
fouth, is about 3, and its grcateft length, from eaft to weft, 
about 4 miles. The furface in general is nearly level, and 
interrupted by no confiderable rifings or fallings, till it ap- 
proaches to the roots of Soutra hill. Soutra is the wefter- 
moft ridge of that chain of mountains, called the Lammer- 
xnuir hills, which run along the upper part of the county of 
Eaft Lothian, and terminate a little to the eallward of Dun- 
bar. The height of Soutra is not accurately known, but is 
believed to be fomething about 1000 feet above the level of 
the fea. To a traveller coming from the fouth, the view 
from Soutra is moft enchanting. Paftlng for a confiderable 
way through a dreary muir, where nothing meets the eye 
but barren heath ; — here all at once the fine cultivated coun- 
ties of Mid and Eaft Lothians, with the Frith of Forth, and 
coaft of Fyfe, burft upon his view. The fuddennefs of the 
change, and the mingled group of hills, and dales, and 
woods, and waters, which now ftretch extenfive to the eye, 

give

give fuch a throb of pleafure to the heart, as is not to be de- 
fcribed. 

Climate, Mofs, Fuel, &amp;c.— The air is (harp, but falubrious. 
It is fometimes, however, loaded with fogs, owing to the im- 
mediate vicinity of Soutra-hill and Fala-muir, which is ex- 
tenfive and wet. In this muir there is a fmall piece of water, 
called the Flow, which alfo gives its name to a good part of 
the marfhy grounds, lying to the fouth and weft of it. Of 
this mofs, which contains fome hundreds of acres, no ufe is 
at prefent made, but digging of peats for the fmall village of 
Fala. The proprietor, it is true, attempted laft year a ma- 
nufactory of peats, by charring and grinding them to a fine 
powder, for covering the moulds ufed in founderies ; but 
this fcheme has been given up. The draining of the muir 
would yield, in the end, the moft certain profit to all con- 
cerned, and it would likewife add very much to the mild- 
nefs of the air of Fala and its neighbourhood. Something 
of this fort, upon a fmall fcale, has been attempted by the 
prelent tenant j but nothing effectual can be done without 
the interference of the proprietor, as no tenant would chufe 
to fink fo confiderable a fum, as the draining would require, 
upon the fhort leafe of 20, or even 30 years. 

Soil, Produce, and Sheep. — The lower part of the parifh is 
moftly clay, and produces all the variety of crops which are 
ufual in other parts of the Lothians. The upper part of the 
parifh is moftly heath ; and the crops commonly cultivated 
are barley and oats, with an interchange of turnips, grafs, 
and potatoes. 1 his upper, or muirland part, is by far the 
moft extenfive, comprehending nearly two thirds of the 
whole. It is at prefent divided into four farms, which to- 
gether maintain about 144 fcore of fheep. The fpecies of 

Vol. X. 4 G fheep

Siatijlical Account 



fheep, reared on thefe farms, is a crofs breed between the Ga- 
la Water and the Tweedfmuir, a fpecies fomewhat fhorter 
than the Cheviot, though longer than the Tweedfmuir. But 
a gentleman from Edinburgh, now in poffefiion of one of 
the farms, has much improved the breed by crofimg it with 
the Cheviot. He tried alfo a Spanifh ram, but found it did 
not anfwer. The wool, per flone, of late years, has fold at 
from 7 s. to lis. But nothing, perhaps, would more con- 
tribute to the improvement of the breed, as well as of the 
wool, than the laying down thofe lands, which are fown 
with corn, in pafture grafs. This would, upon the whole, 
be even as profitable for the farmer ; for though his gains 
might be fometimes lefs, yet they would be much furer. 
The reafon is obvious — In this high part of the country, the 
crops in general are fo very late, that they never come to 
full maturity. Befides, they are liable to fo many rilks, 
from winds, froft, and rain, which crops in a lower climate 
are not expofed to, that they are feldom got in in good con- 
dition. It fometimes, however, happens, that a dry feafon, 
fuch as the laft has been, may enable the farmer to get in 
his corns pretty foon, and tolerably ripe ; but this happens 
fo very feldom, that it is truly furprifing, that any man of 
confideration fhould ever venture to run the rifle, efpecially 
as his lands might be otherwife laid out, to nearly an equal, 
and a more certain advantage : But a lucky feafon, like a 
lucky chance at cards or dice, induces the muirland farmer, 
with the gamefler, ftill to venture another ftake. 

State of Improvement, &amp;c. — The lands in general are well 
cultivated, and many of them incloled. ' This, high ftate of 
cultivation is, in a gre.it meafure, owing to the fpirited ex- 
ertions of the late Mr Hamilton of Fala. He firft fet 

the 



of Fala and Soutra, 



the example of improving, by inclofing part of his eftate 
with ditch and hedge, and flieltering their inclofures with 
clumps and belts of planting. This not only added to the 
general beauty of this part of the country, but excited a fi- 
milar fpirit of improvement in the neighbouring gentlemen. 
But a great deal more in this way remains ftill to be done. 
Soutra-hill is yet a large fubjeft lor improvement. 11 it 
were properly planted and incloled, the parilh of Fala might 
vie in piclurefque beauty with any in the country. 

Cattle and Rent — The tillage of the parilh is rated at 1 74- 
plough-gates. About 52 work horfes are daily employed, 
for the purpofes of agriculture, exclufive of faddle and young 
horfes, which perhaps may amount to nearly as many. 1 he 
number of black cattle, upon an average, may be 177. — The 
valued rent of the parilh is 1326 1. 7 s. 8 d. Scotch; the 
real rent, about 1 100L Sterling. In the year 1727, the real

which, when compared with the prefent, Ihews, in an emi- 
nent degree, the now high Itate of cultivation.

fees of regillration — There are no remarkable inttances of lon- 
gevity in the parilh, though there are feveral very healthy peo- 
pie between 70 and 80.

Village and Se£lanes.— The only village in the parifh, is 
Fala, which confifts of a few miferable cottages, and con- 
tains about 100 inhabitants, young and old. And the only 

diffenters are the Burgher Seceders. They have built a 
houfe in the village for public worfhip, as well as a houle for 
their minifter. The meeting, however, is not very nume. 
rous, and is chiefly made up from the neighbouring parifhes. 

Employments, W iges, and Manners — As no foreign trade 
or manufactory is carried on in the pariih, the inhabitants 
are moftly employed in agriculture. There arc, however, 2 
wrights, I fmith, 1 baker, 3 mafons, 3 taylors, and 3 wea- 
vers. A manufactory of cotton might be ettabliftied here 
with fome advantage, as there is plenty of water for the 
movement of the machinery, and the great road from Edin- 
burgh to London leads directly through the village — Every 
kind of mechanical work is fully as high priced here as in 
Edinburgh. Male fervants, employed in hufbandry, have 
from 6 1. to 9 1. and female fervants from 3 1. to 4 L Sterling 
of yearly wages, exclufive of bed and board. Day-labourers 
have from is. to is. 6 d. per day. The manners of the 
common people are, in general, rather rough. This parti- 
cular trait of character is, in fome meafure, owing to the 

fcarcity

fcarcity of hands, and the high rate of wages, which makes 
them at once independent and infolent. 

Poor. — The poor, at prefent upon the roll, are far from 
being numerous — a lucky circumftance for the heritors, as 
the funds for lupporting them are wonderfully flender. They 
folely arife from the perquilltes of a mort- cloth, which is fo 
very ragged that nobody will ufe it ; and the collections at 
the church door, which may amount, upon an average to 

1 s. every Sunday. This may be thought a very fmall col- 
lection, from the number of parilhioners already ftated ; but 
it will not be found to be fo very fmall, when we confider, 
that, in this part of the country, it is only falhionable for the 
lower claffes of the people to attend the church. The higher 
orders are above the vulgar prejudices, of believing it neceffa- 
ry to worfhip the God of their fathers. They have long 
adopted the philolophy of France, in efteeming religion an 
ufelefs burden to the ftate. 

SchooI C3V. — The fchoolmafter's falary is not the largeft 
in Scotland, being only 2I. 4 s. 4 d. The fchool fees are in 
proportion. Englifh is is. 6 d. writing 2 s. and arithmetic 

2 s. 6 d. per quarter ; — very great encouragement indeed, for 
a man of abilities to be fchoolmafter of Fala ! 

Church *. — Lady Dalrymple-Hamilton-M'Gillof Fala, and 
the city of Edinburgh, are joint patrons of the parifh. — The 
church is fmall, and indifferently feated j but as no great ones 
attend, it does not much fignify. — The manfe is roomy and.

IVemyfst Kirkurd, Ormifion, and Gogar, together with the lands 
of B/attce, were annexed to the Trinity College Church q£ 
Edinburgh, in the year 1529.

convenient ; but, though new, draws water through every 
part of the walls and roof expofed to the blaft. The ftipend 
is charafteriftic of the religion of our great folks, rather 
fmall.— Including an allowance for communion elements, it 
confifts of 37 1. 12 s. 7 d. in money ; 20 bolls 2 firlots bear, 
and 24 bolls 2 firlots oats in grain; which, when we confi- 
der the very inferior quality of corn in the muirland farms, 
that pay the moft of it, feldom amounts to above 60 I. a 
year. If we take into the account the remarkable high 
prices of provifions here, this fmall fum is very inadequate 
to the maintainance of a family, unlefs they are clothed, like 
the Baptift of old, in coats of Jkins ; and live, too, like him, 
upon locujls and wild honey. 

Antiquities. — Vulgar report fays, that in the S. W. part of 
the parifh, there are fome traces of a Roman camp ; but 
thefe have been fo often defcribed, and fo often miftaken, 
that the author of this article (hall neither attempt a defcrip- 
tion, nor hazard a conjecture concerning them. The only 
authentic remains of antiquity, to be met with in the parifh, 
are the ruins of an hofpital* upon Soutra-hill. — On the 

north 

* This hofpital was founded in the year 1164, by Malcolm 
IV. King of Scotland, for the relief of pilgrims, and for poor 
and fickly people. To this charitable institution, the royal 
founder annexed fome lands near to St. Leonard's, in the neigh- 
bourhood of Edinburgh. It had alfo the privileges of a fane- 
tuary, as appears from the name of the road leading to it, from 
the abbacy of Melrofe. From Bridgend, about half a mile a- 
bove Dornick to the weft, on the fouth fide of the Tweed, there 
has been a plain road or caufeway, through the muirs to Sou- 
tra-hill, called the Girthgate, from the word Girth, which, in 
the Gaelic, figDifics an ajylum or fanftuary. The traces of this 
road are ftill vifible in many places of the muir. Another cir- 
cumftance, illuftrative of Soutra's having formerly been a place 
•f refuge, is, that about half a mile to the fouth of the hofpital, 

there

north fide of the hill, a little below where the hofpital flood, 
there is a fountain of excellent water, which was dedicated 
to the Holy Trinity, dill called Trinity Well.— This well, 

though 

there is a fmall eminence or rifing ground, ftill called Croft* 
chain-hill It would appear that along this hill, and acrofs the 
Girthgate, there had been a chain fufpended for a confiderable 
■way, in the direction of eaft and weft, to mark the boundaries 
of. the privileged ground. Criminals, who had the happinefs 
to pafs or crofs this chain, however clofely purfued, were fhfe 
from every harm, and exempted from profecution. Alex- 
ander of Soltra, or Sautra, is mentioned as mailer of this 
hofpital in the year 1204; and, in 1292, Prynne, in his Col- 
lections, ftyles Rodolphus, " Magijier Hofpita/is de Soitre" 
John Heriot vicar of Soutra, is witnefs to feveral charters in 
the year 1467. Adjoining to the hofpital, and under its jurif- 
diction, there was a church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity. 
This circumftance has led fome authors into the belief of Sou- 
tra's having been a monaftery ; for under this appellation, we 
find Douglas in his Peerage, uniformly ftyling it. 

It does not appear, that ever this hofpital was richly endow- 
ed ; though feveral donations were made to it, at a very early 
period. Among the tirft of thefe donations, was that of the 
patronage of the church of Wemyfs in Fife, made to it by Sir, 
John de Methkil, an anceftor of the Earl of Wemvss. This 
donation runs in the following words : *' Dominus Johannes 
«' Methkil, miles, &amp;c. — dedi]/e, &amp;c. — Deo, et ecclsfiae Sanclas 
" Trinitatii de Soltray, ma^ijlro et f'ratribus ibidem Deo Jervj- 
4 entibus, 3C. totum jus, quod habeo, vel habere pctui, vel antecefjb- 
t( ret mei habere poteruni in ecclejia Sanclae Marine de Wemyss, 
*' pro anima mea, et anima comitis Dun can i, et pro animabut fa- 

tris et matris" &amp;c. &amp;c Though this donation has no date, 
yet it appears to have been made in the end of the reign of 
King William, who died in the year 12 14. It was afterwards 
confirmed by Sir John's heir and fucceiTor, Michael de 
Wemyss. We find another donation, but of what nature is not 
certainly known, made to it, by Sir David de Grsme, to which 
Dominus Alexander Seaton, of the noble family of Winton, 
and Magijler Thomas de Seaton, are witneffes. This charter 
of donation has likewife no date ; but it appears to have been 
made between the years 1226 and 1230. Sir john de Keith, 
Great Marifhal of Scotland, confirms to Soltray, a donation of 
the lands of Johnfton in Eaft Lothian, of which he was fupe- 
rior, in the beginning of the reign of Alexander III. 1

though It does not now appear to have any medicinal quali- 
ties, was formerly much celebrated, and much frequented by 
fick and difeafed perfons. — On the weft of the hofpital, there 
is a fmall houfe and offices, with a property of between 3 
and 4 acres of land, belonging to one Pringle, which is 
faid to have been a gift from King James V. for a night's 
lodging, when he was feparated from his companions upon 
a hunting party. This fmall property has continued e- 
ver fince in the fame family, from father to fon, with- 
out addition or diminution. — Sautra feems formerly to 
have been a very confiderable village, and a place of much 
conviviality, if we may guefs from the great number of pub- 
lic houfes, faid to have been in it. Now there is nothing to 
mark the happy fpot where the village flood, but two or 
three wretched cottages, feeble remembrancers of its antient 
greatnefs.

(County and Prejbytery of Perth. — Synod of Perth 

and Stirling. J 

By the Reverend Mr John Do we, Minifter.</head> 


<p>Origin of the Name. 

THE name, in Gaelic, is faid to fignify the Middle, and, 
in that language, the adjective doiv, or black, is com- 
monly added in fpeaking of it ; and the origin of that ap- 
pellation was fuppofed to be, That it was fituated nearly in 
the middle of the great valley, (or Strathmore,) on the louth 
of the Grampian Mountains, which extend from Dumbar- 
ton to Stonehaven, and nearly at equal diftance from thofe 
mountains, and the ridge of the Ochills, which there bound 
that valley on the lbuth, Others contend, that the word 
Methven may be interpreted, the Little Mountain. This 
name is not defcri[ tive of the fituation of the village,, which 
lies in a hollow j but in a good meafure applies to the fite 
of the Caftle, which ftands, with a dignified appearance, on 
pretty high ground. The village, which is now confider- 
able, feems to have originated from a collegiate church, 
founded before the middle of the i 5th century. But, it ap- 
pears, that the old caftle of Methven was of a much earlier 
date, and therefore communicated its name to the collegiate 
church.

Extent and Surface t csV. — This pari fli, from E. to W. Is, at 
an average, about 5 Englifh miles ; and between 3 and 4 from 
N. to S. The furface is agreeably varied by hollows and 
rifing ground : But, in general, it flopes from north to fouth, 
where it terminates in a narrow plain, the weft part of 
which is a morafs, which fupplies with peat the neighbour- 
ing inhabitants, and from whence two ftreams take their 
rife ; the moft confiderable of which runs weftward into the 
Earn, and the other eaftward into the Almond : Both have 
the name of the Potv. Tne cultivated foil is, in general, 
good ; one part clay, another loam, and a third gravel ; but 
the clay foil predominates. There is a tract of wafte ground, 
above 800 acres, on the north fide of the parifti, which was 
a common, and is now divided. A confiderable part of it 
is very improveable ; and it is hoped, that, in due time, the 
hand of perlevering induftry will transform the uncultivated 
heath, into verdant paftnres and plentiful fields. 

Rivers, csV. — The Almond-, which bounds the greatefi: 
part of this parilh on the N. and E. is a large and rapid 
current oi water, and, in its courfc, turns a number of mills 
of various kinds. Its banks are bold and rocky, and in ma- 
ny places agreeably wooded. It furnilhes fome very pic- 
turefque and romantic views, as it panes the eftate of 
Lednock, the property of Mr Graham of Balgowan. It 
was formerly well fiored with fine trout, &amp;c. but the late 
erection of a high dike to raife the water, which fupplies 
the cotton fpinning, and other works, of Cromwell Park, 
prevents almoft every kind of fifli from penetrating any far- 
ther ; and probably, in a fhort time, they will entirely defert 
the river. 



Woods*

Woods. — The wood of Mcthven is the only natural one, 
of any extent, in the parifh. It covers 172 Scotch a- 
cres, and is of confiderable value to the proprietor, Lord 
Methven. It is cut in about 18 divifions, at the age of 25 
years. It confifts of oaks, many of which have been lately 
allowed to ftand for timber, birch, &amp;c. The hazel has 
been let at the rent of 12L to a coal company, for above 20 
years. The prdent wood lies a little eaftward of the Caftle, 
to which it is a great ornament ; but anciently it extended 
a confiderable diftance to the fouth and well, as is evident 
from fome old oaks flili remaining in cultivated fields ; and 
from an old farm which retains the name of Weftwood or 
Woodhead. There are likewife fome fpots of natural wood, 
on the banks of the Almond. 

Agriculture and Produce, Isfc. *. — Within thefe 20 years, 
the improvements in agriculture have been very great in this 
pariih, as well as in other places ; and, of conlequence, the 
rents are much increafed. This is owing to the life of limr, 
which is become very general, and is got at the port of 
Perth, either from Lord Elgin's lime works, on the Frith 

of 

* Thirty years ago, almoft the whole of this pariih was pof- 
fefTed in Runr'tg ; the tenants of 3, 4, 5, or 6 ploughgates, 
living in one Town, as it was called, and occupying a large 
tract of ground in that manner. About one third of the land, 
next to the houfes, was called Infield, or Crt,ft land, and whs 
cropped alternately with oats and barley, the whi le dung bo- 
ing laid on with the barley The remainder of the farm was 
called Outfield ; of which one third, or more, wis in uats, and 
the reft in paflure. The, cattle were folded in lummer, on that 
part of the outfield, which was to be broken up the cniuing 
feafon, after which 3 crops of oats were taken ; and io:nelimes  
if the ground did not fcem to be quite exhausted, a fourth ; 
after which it was left out for pafture, until it had fo far reco- 
vered, as to be able again to undergo the fame operation.

of Forth, or from Sunderland. Some years ago, there was 
alfo a good deal of marl difcovered, with which fome of the 
grounds have been manured. Tenants now fee the error 
of over cropping their lands, after lime or marl, and there- 
fore often fow clover and rye-grafs with their barley crop. 
Every pofleflbr of a few roods of ground, finds it profitable 
to fow iome pounds of red clover *. Barley, grafs, oats, 
flax, peafe, and beans, are the common crops -f-. Of late, 
fome wheat has been railed, but very few turnips. Probably, 
however, the farmers, in a few more years, will fee it their 
intereft to clean their grounds with a turnip fallow, where 
land is fuitable for producing that valuable root ; for it ieems 
to be allowed, that the two great points of hufbandry are, 
to keep ground clear of root-weeds, (which cannot be done 
lb profitably as by a turnip fallow well dreffed ;) and to keep 
it always in good heart, (which is to be done by the plenty 
of dung, arifing from the ufe of turnips:):). The average 
rent, per acre, of the cultivated ground, is probably about 
j c s. There are a few acres, in the near neighbourhood of 
the village, let at 2 1. 2 s. and upwards ; and two pretty 

large 

* When grafs fir ft began to be introduced as a crop, the 
old tenants were much offended ; and their common language 
was,  That it was a JJjame to fee beafts meat growing where 
* men's meat fhould grow.'

barley gave 14 s. 6 d. per boll, Linlithgow meafure. A good 
ploughman has 8 1. and his maintenance ; a lervant maid from 
50 s. to 3 1. ; a day-labourer 1 s. ; and, in public works, from 
1 s. to 1 s. 6 d. per day. 

I This parifh owes much of its improvements to Mr Graham 
of Balgowan, who firft fet the example of inclofing his turms, 
and gave encouragement to judicious tenants, by granting them 
eafy leafes, and providing them with comfortable houfes.

large farms at i I. 5 s. per acre. This was reckoned high, 
3 years ago, when the leafes were granted j but, in all pro- 
bability, will prove a profitable concern. 

State of Property. — Two thirds of the parifh belongs to 
Lord Methven and Mr Graham of Balgowan. 
The other third comprehends the eftatcs of Tippermalloch 
and Bachilton, (belonging to Mr Duncan and Mr Oliphaiit,) 
with the (mail property of Wefter Campfey, and feveral lit- 
tle feus which hold of Lord Methven. — ^The valued rent is 
6400 i. Scotch. The real rent amounts to fomething more 
than 3000 1. Stirling, per annum. Almoft the whole of the 
parifli was anciently comprehended in the Barony or Lord- 
fhip of Methven. While that eftate remained in the Crown, 
various portions of it were granted in feu to different per- 
fons •, and the feu duties of thefe lands are now paid to Lord 
Methven, as proprietor of the Lordlhip, although the lands 
are held of the Crown. 

Ecclejiajlical State. — The ftipend, by decreet, dated 1650, 
is 12 chalders of victual, two thirds meal, and one third

# The Dotfor's immediate predecefTor, was Mr William 
Moncrieff, fettled in 1694. The minifters between the Re- 
ftoratton and the Revolution, were Mr Ramsay and Mr Omev ; 
and, when Prefbyterianifm was re- eftablifhed in Scotland, in 
1 638, Mr Robert Murray, of the family of Woodend, a lmali 
eftate in this neighbourhood, was then minifter, whofe fon, Mr 
John Murray, fucceeded him : They were both eminent in 
their times. John Duke of Argyll's great-grand-father's 
father, in the maternal line, was brother to the above Mr Ro- 
bert Murray : His name was William Murray ; he was 
minifter of Dyfart ; and there was another brother, Thomas, 
who was Preceptor to King Charles 1. By the intereft of 
the preceptor, his nephew, William, fon to the minifter of Dy- 
fart, was educated with the young Prince, who contracted fo 
great an affection for his play fellow, that he afterwards created 
him Earl of Dylart. He married Elizabeth Bruce, of the fa- 
mily of Clackmannan, by whom he had two daughters, Eli- 
zabeth, Countefs of Dysart, and Margaret, married to 
Lord Maynard, in England. The Countefs married Sir 
Lionel Tollemache of Helingham, in the county of Suf- 
folk, by whom Ihe had Lionel, Earl of Dysart, and another 
fon ; alfo two daughters, Elizabeth and Catharine. Elizabeth 
married Archibald, rirft Duke of Argyll, by whom Ihe had 
John, the great Duke, the Earl of Islay, and Anne, married 
to James 2d Earl of Bute, and mother to John, the late Earl. 
Catharine, the other daughter, was married, ift, to James 
Lord Down, fon and heir of Alexander Earl of Murray, 
and next to John Earl of Sutherland. The Counted, after 
Sir Lionel's death, married the great Duke of Lauderdale. 
Thus the little family of Woodend, foon connected itfelf with 
fame of the belt families in both kingdoms.

To which is added, the annual intereft of 267 1. bequeathed, 
at different times, to the poor of the parifh. There are 9 
diftricts, whofe houfeholders collect the proportions by rota- 
tion, and give them to the fchoolmafter, (the treasurer and 
cleric of the fund, ) who makes a weekly diftribution, com- 
monly after divine fervice. In 1775, the number of poor, 
on the ftated lift, was 36, who received weekly 1 1. 10 s. In 
1 793, the number is 2 1, and the weekly expenditure il, 3s. 2d. 
The heritors and houfeholders meet twice a year, and fix 
the aflefiment tor the enfuing half year. The feffion have 
alio power from the heritors to expend, on occafional poor, 
the whole of the weekly collections, &amp;c which amount to 
about 18 1. per annum: And the late Dr Oswald be- 
queathed 100 1. the intereft of which is to be annually given 
to fuch houfeholders, as the feffion know to need a tempo- 
rary relief, but who do not receive regular fupplies from the 
aliened funds of the parifh. This furely is a well judged 
charity.

Markets, CSV — Two butchers carry on their bufinefs in 
the village, who annually kill about 2000 fheep, between 
300 and 400 calves, about 150 fat cattle, and about 60 
fwine. Their trade has alfo increafed rapidly. About 13 
years ago, the butcher market here commenced about the 
latter end of Auguft, and clofed about the middle of Janua- 
ry ; during which time there were fold, at an average, per 
week, 40 carcafes of fheep and goats ; in ail about 850. But, 
of late, the public taffe has fo much improved, that there is 
no more demand for goats flefh. It is only 13 years fince 
beef was fir ft expofed to fale in the village. It was a fat ox, 
value 7 1. ; and the young man, who embarked in the con- 
cern, was thought very injudicious. The fame man now 
frequently fells more than one in a week, during the plenti- 
ful feafon ; and, for fome of thefe, he has paid 17I. and 1 81.

Thefc little circumftances are mentioned to fhew, how much 
the manner of living is improved here in fo fhort a time. 
About 4 fifths of the meat.expofedtofalein the village, are fold 
in the neighbourhood, and what remains on hand is carried to 
Perth : And it may be added, that, in quality and variety, 
it is, for the moft part, equal to what is to be had in the 
Perth market. The trade of killing cattle for the Perth 
market was long carried on, to a confiderable extent, by the 
inhabitants of this village and neighbourhood; and the Meth- 
ven butchers were, about 50 or 60 years ago, much richer, 
and in better credit, than thofe of Perth. 

Roads. — As a great part of the panfli tonfifts of ftrong 
clay, our roads in winter have been wretck^'iy bad, the fta- 
tute labour not being adequate to uphold them in decent re- 
pair. But lately, an act of Parliament has been obtained 
for a turnpike road between Perth and Crieff, the line of 
which pafies through a great part of this parifh ; and is con- 
• dueled through an uneven country, with a ikill which does 
much honour to the abilities of Mr Abercrombie, the engi- 
neer, who directed it. It will be finifhed in the course of 
this feafon, (autumn 1793,) and will contribute much to the 
improvement and accommodation of this country. The 
crofs roads are alfo afiuming a much better appearance, now 
that the ftatute labour is applied entirely to them. 

Antiquities. — The firft mentionfound of Methten, in hif- 
tory, is about the year 970, when Colenus, reputed the 79th 
King of Scotland, is faid to have been killed in its neighbour- 
hood, by Ro hard, Thane of Methven, whofe daughter he had 
deflowered. Before 1323, the lands of Methven belonged to 
the Mowbray's*, whofe anceftor, Roger Mow brat,

— The firft religious eftablilhment here was a Provoftry, 

or 

Scotland, and became very flourifhing. To Sir Roger Mow- 
bray belonged the baronies of Kelly, Eckford, Dnlmeny, and, 
Methven, lying in the fhires of Forfar, Roxburgh, Linlithgow,' 
and Perth : But, for adhering to the Baliol and Englifh inte- 
relr, his lands were confifcated by Robert L. who bellowed 
Eckford, Kelly, and Methven, on his fon in law, Walter, the 
8th hereditary Lord High Steward of Scotland, whofe fon, Ro- 
bert, was afterwards King, and the 2d of the name, in right 
of his mother Marjory Bruce, daughter of Robert I. The 
Lordfhip of Methven was granted by him to Walter Stew- 
art, Earl of Athole, his 2d fon, by Euphame Rofs, his 2d 
wife ; and, after his forfeiture, remained in the Crown a confi« 
derable time. It became part of the dowery lands ufually ap- 
propriated for the maintenance of the Queen Dowager of Scot- 
land, together with the Lordfhip and Cattle of Stirling, and 
the lands of Balquhidder, &amp;c. all of which were fettled on 
Margaret, Queen Dowager of James IV. who, in the year 
1524, having divorced her 2d hufband, Archibald Earl of 
Angus, married Henry Stewart, 2d fon of Andrew Lord Evan- 
dale, afterwards Ochiltree, a defcendant of Robert Duke of 
Albany, fon of King Robert II. Margaret was the eldeft 
daughter of Henry VII. of England, in whofe right James VI. 
of Scotland, her great grandfon, fucceeded to that Crown, on' 
the death of Queen Elizabeth. She procured for her third 
hufband a peerage from her fon James V. under the title of 
Lord Methven, anno 1528 ; and, on this occalion, the barony 
of Methven was diffolved from the Crown, and eretfed into a 
Lordfhip, in favour of Henry Stewart and his heirs male, on 
the Queen's refigning her jointure of the Lordfhip of Stirling. 
By Lord Methven fhe had a daughter, who died in infancy, be- 
fore herfelf. The Queen died at the Caftle of Methven, in 
1540; and was buried at Perth, befide the body of King James 
I. Lord Methven afterwards married Janet Stewart, daugh- 
ter of the Earl of Athoil, by whom he had a fon, Henry II. 
Lord Methven, who married Jean, daughter of Patrick Lord 
Ruthven, and was killed at Broughton, by a cannon ball from 
the Caille of Edinburgh, in 1572, leaving a fon, Henry III. 
Lord Methven, who died without iiftie. This 3d Lord Meth- 
ven is mentioned on the authority of Stewart' 's Genealogical Ac- 
count 0/ the Houfi of Stewart. In rhe year 1584, the Lordlhip 
of Methven and Balquhidder was conferred on Lodowick

CharaBer of the People. — The people are fober and induf- 
trious, charitable to the poor, and compaflionate to objects 
in diftrefs. They are regular in their attendance on the 

ordinances 

eft difficulties and diftrefles. The account of the battle is thus 
given by a modern hiftorian. — « Bruce, having had no time 
' to difcipline his men, had formed a camp at Methven, near 
1 Perth, which was the head quarter of the Englifh General j 
4 and there lay, upon the defenfive, well knowing the difadvan- 

* tage he was under from his men not being dilciplined. He 
 had already attempted to fuprife Perth ; but failing in his de- 

* fign, he had retired to Methven, from whence he fent a chal- 
« lenge to the Earl to fight him. According to Barbour, and 

* the beft hiftorians, the challenge was accepted ; but, on the 
' night before the day appointed, which was the 20th of July, 
1 while the Scots thought themfelves fecure, and were unpro- 
' vided for battle, they were attacked, and routed by their ene- 
« mies, in the park of Methven.' 

Guthrie's Htft. 0/ Scotland, Vol. II. page 177. 

* The common tradition is, that BefTy Bell was daughter 
of the Laird of Kinvaid, and Mary Gray of the Laird of Led- 
nock. Being near neighbours, a great intimacy fubfifted be- 
tween the young ladies. When they were together at Led- 
nock, the plague broke out, anno 1645 » t0 av °id which, they 
retired to a romantic fpot, called Burn Breas, on the eftate of 
Lednock, where they lived for iome time ; but, afterwards, 
caught the infection from a young gentleman, an admirer of 
both, who came to vifit them in their folitude : And here they 
died ; and were buried at fom e diftance from their bower, near 
a beautiful bank of the Almond.

pious care, the fpot of ground, and confecrated it to the me-

<p>Name, Lake, Fi/h t bfc 

THE Loch of Spynie, which has given this parifh its 
name, is the fir ft object in a ftatiftical account which 
claims attention. This lake is more than 3 miles in length, 
and about 1 in breadth. It bounds the parifh along its N. 
fide, and appears to have been a Frith of the Sea, though it 
is now fhut up by a long extent of valuable land at each end, 
both on the E. and W. Accordingly part of the country, 
between the lake and the fea, ftill retains the name of Ross 
Isle ; and there is a place near its weftern end called Kin- 
trae, (in Gaelic, Cean Traidhe,J which fignifies, the Head 
of the Tide. Befides which, beds of fhells, principally oyf- 
ters, which are not now found on the coaft, are frequently 
difcovered on the banks of the lake, feveral feet below the 
furface of the earth *. This lake abounds with fwans ;

and FoRDONj in his Hiftory, remarks it as a curiofity. 
There arc alfo perch and trout in this lake. 

Palace — The Bishop's Palace is the next object to 
which the attention is mod naturally called. It is fituated 
in the eaftern extremity of the parifh, on the b#nk of the 

lake ; 

from the chartulary, that, in 145 1, the bifhop got this village 
erecttd into a burgh of barony, and the next year into a burgh 
of regality ; but there is now no other veftige of it than a mar- 
ket crofs. But although it is evident, that, at a period compa- 
ratively not remote, the fea flowed into the fpace which the 
lake now occupies, and covered, befides, a large extent of land 
at each end of it ; yet it is alfo obvious, that, at a ftill more re- 
cent period, the bounds of this lake were more limited than at 
prefent. For, a few years ago, when the canal, which had long 
been neglected, was cleaned out and enlarged, a caufeway was 
difcovered, ftretching from this parifli quite acrofs the lake, in 
which there were feveral paffages for the water, each about 3 
feet wide, and covered by a thick flag-ftone ; and, upon its ap- 
pearance, a tradition was recollected, that this caufeway was cal- 
led the BiJJjop's Steps, and had been formed by his influence, 
for the accommodation of the miniflers of St. Andrew's, who 
officiated alfo in the church of Oguejion, (fince united to Draitty,) 
both having been menfal churches before the eftablifhment of 
Prefbytery. Bifhop Falconer told the author this; and that 
the Bifhop's prieft, who officiated, had prayers in the forenoon 
in the one, and in the afternoon in the other, and thereafter 
his dinner in the Caflle every Sunday. This caufeway was 
foon converted, by Mr Brander of Pitgaveny, into a fubftan- 
tial road, by which a more direct communication was opened 
between Elgin and the more. And as he is now farther im- 
proving the canal, fo as to gain nearly two feet of additional 
fall, it is expected, when this work is completed, that the lake will 
be again reduced to its ancient narrow limits. It may be farther 
obferved, that it has been conjectured, that the vaft qnantity of 
land waflied up by the fea, on the coaft between Nairn and Find- 
hord, and drifted eafhvard by the wind over the eftate of Cu- 
bin, deflroyed the oyfters on the coaft, and fhut up the lake on 
the weft, which, preventing any current, permitted the alluvion 
of the river Spey to clofe it in at the eaft, as the appearance of 
ifee ground feems ftill to fhew.

tificial iiland emerged, upon clearing out the canal, of an 
oval form, about 60 by 16 paces, appearing to be compofed 
of ftones from the quarry, bound together by crookrd branches 
of oak, and as if the earth, with which it was completed, 
had been wholly wafhed off during its fubmerfion. The 
palace itfelf was a magnificent and fpacious building, round 
a fquare court, having the, gate on the eaft fide, and fortified 
by towers at the corners, and a dry ditch on the weft and 
fouth, containing lofty halls, deep vaults, a chapel, fhbles, 
and other offices *. The remains of paintings, on a part of

* Spynie Palace has been lb often defcribed by antiquarians, 
that it would be ufclefs to recapitulate thefubjec"t at large. It may, 
however, be obferved, that although there is no certainty when 
the palace was firfl: founded, yet the bilhopric was erected by 
Malcolm Can more, anno 1057 ; and we are authorifed to fay, 
that Grecory was appointed billiop here, in the year 1107, by 
the Cartulary of Drumf erling, when King William confirmed to 
that monaltery the cell of Urquhart, in this neighbourhood, and 
renewed the privileges and gifts to this abbacy, made by Mal- 
colm, and the worthy St. Margaret his wife. Kng James 
II. anno 1450, by his charter in the public records, refers alio to 
the gifts made by that King's fuccelfors, Duncan, Edgar, Ethel- 
r ed his brother, Alexander, and Sybtlla his Queen, David, 
Malcolm, William, and Robert Bruce, fucceffiveiy. Hence 
we may infer, that the fame King Malcolm Canmore creeled this 
diocefe, at this period, and the bdhops occupied the church as a ca- 
thedral ; and made their refidence here, as well as at Birnie and 
King-edward, where they lived in CafUes, which are dill remain,

The boundaries of eftates were early attended to. There was a 
diftinft march, dividing Spynie and Fmdraffie from Kintrae and 
Quarrywood, by agreement, in 1226, between Hugh de Mora- 
via, and his brother the bifhop, and efhblifhmg the road to

Burroivbrigi, /j 1 tighter- Spynie, and Auldroehiy. Thofe of the 
Crowi: were Leggat, Kintrae, and Quarrywood, and Barony of 
Weftfield. 

The earlieft feu of the bifhop is that of a ftance for a miln up- 
on Auchter Spynie, (Sherriffmiln, ) in a donation of the laid 
Andrew, bifhop of Murray, to Walter of Duffus, his bro- 
ther, anno 1237. As on this dance alone, a mdn is built, a 
few rigs along with it, though 6 miles diftant from the baro- 
ny, continued the miln of that eltate 5©© years, and lately were 
purchafed, from Mr Arthur Duff, by the proprietor of Duffus,

themfeives were teued before the year /309, in favour of .^dah 
Steven, burgefs of Elgin ; and the laid ftance of a miln is there 
referved. They were in the perfon of Thomas Urquhart of 
Bui .'fyards, in 1390. The lands of Auldrochty belonged to Ro- 
bert Sibbald, in 1398 Findralfie was fewed by the bifhop to 
John, Dominus de Toilres, and Margaret his wife, anno 1378. 

The remaining lands of the church continued with the bifhop 
till the eve of the Reformation, when Bifhop Hepburn made 
great havock. What of them were laved from his prodigal 
hands, with the feu duties and patronages, were granted by 
James VI. in favour of Alexander Lindsay, who was created 
Lord Spynie, and the bilhopric erecled into a temporal Lord- 
fhip to him and his heirs and affignees, and to Jean Lyon, 
Conntefs of Angus, his wife. 

This Alexander Lindfty, a brother of the Earl of Craw- 
furd, was a great favourite of this Prince, who wrote him from 
Denmark, advifing him to the marriage of Jean Lyon, in 
thefe words : ' Dear Sandy, marry her — your young tout will 
' blaft her old born.'— About the year 1605, Lord Spynie dif.

fluence which the clergy, for a long period, pofleffed over the 
minds of men. In this enlightened age, we can hardly think, 
without indignation, of that fpiritud bondage in which our an- 
ceftors were held ; but, perhaps, a philofopher, in viewing the 
ftate of focfety in this country, during the times of Epifcopacy, 
when the police was extremely insperrecl, and the j»overrment 
too weak to enforce obedience to the laws, would confider the 
great afcei deocy of licclelialiics to have been a happy circum-

to redrefs injuries from powerful layman ; and thus ferved to 
mitigate thole evils, which couid only be cured by the wifdom

Although no perfon, in the catalogue of the Moray Bishops,

a pretty high hill, and clothed almoft throughout its whole

hill, that fupplies a large extent of country with mill-ftones, 
and the town of Elgin and the neighbourhood with {tones 
for building. When the intended Bridge over the 
Spey at Fochabers comes to be erected, it will, no doubt, 
occur to thofe concerned, that they can no where be fup- 
plied with better ftones, or at a cheaper rate, than from the 
Earl of Fife's quarry in this parifh-. 

Sci/, C/imate, River, &amp;c. — Upon each fide of this ridge 
lies the whole of the cultivated land, in which almoft every 
variety of foil is to be met with, from the heavieft clay to 
the lighteft fand. The air is healthy, and, on the fouth 
fide of the hill, peculiarly foft and warm, during a great 
proportion of the year : On the north fide, the climate is 
not fo pleafant, the foil being wet and cold, and the lake of- 
ten emitting a very thick and difagreeable fog. Thefe dif. 
advantages do not, however, feem to have any bad effects 

upon

upon the health of the inhabitants, no difeafe being more 
prevalent litre than in any other part of the country, — This 
parifh is bounded on the S. throughout the greatcft part of 
its length, by the river Lo/fie, excepting that oppoUte to the 
town of Elgin there is a fine field of about 40 acres, called 
Brrovgh bridge, which belongs to this parifh, though on the 
fouth fide of the river : The reafon of this is, that the Lottie 
formerly run dole by the town, as appears from the title 
deeds of the properties in the adjoining quarter of the burgh, 
which ftill boutid them by the river, although this valuable 
field, the property of the Earl of Findlater, has been, 
from time immemorial, interjected between them. The re- 
verfe of this has happened a little lower down, in a fmaii (e- 
rnicircular field, called Dean's Crook, which has been evident- 
ly cut off from the Cathedral lands of Elgin, by the liver 
occupying the diameter inftead of the periphery, which ftill 
remains a reedy pond. 

Produce. — The productions of the parifh are in no refpecl 
different from thofe of the country around. Grain, includ- 
ing peafe and beans, is the article on which the tenants 
chirfly depend for the payment of their rents, and the pur- 
chafe of the neceflanes of life. On the larger farms, which 
are rented by gentlemen, turnips and fown grafs have their 
places in the rotation of crops ; but, on the fmaller, none of 
the modern improvements in agriculture have yet been a- 
dopted *. Every farmer, however, raifes hay, the foil being 

very 

* Thirty years ago, neither turnips nor potatoes were known 
in this parifh, except a few in gardens. The principal farmers 
have now both in abundance in the open fields, and partake of 
the profits of thefe ufeful productions. Grifs feeds, fuch as 
rye-grafs and clovrr, wrre equally unknown 40 yeais ago. A

very productive, and the fmall pofleflbr finds it his advan- 
tage's one acre will produce 300 (tones, when properly cul- 
tured, which anfwcrs for the food of cattle in fummer, and 
prevents their fending them to the Highland Glens, 40 
miles diftance, which was their former practice, and ftill 
partly orevails. In this parifh and the neighbourhood, with- 
in 4 miles of each other, there are 9 pulgecn houfes well ftor- 
ec) •, a fign of the good grain of the parifh, which, upon an 
average, weighs from 18 to 20 ftones, per boll, of barley; 
15 ftone, per boll, of oats; and \6 (tone, per boll, of wheat. 
The wheat is meal meaiiire. That of the other grain ex- 
ceeds the Linlithgow boll about a peck. 

Cultivation, Farm Rents, CSV. — The farm of Sherriffmiln, 
rented by James Walker, Efq; M. D. claims particular 
notice in an account of this kind. This gentleman, in the 
early part of his life, entered, with all the ardour of enthu- 
fiafm, into the horfe-hoeing hufbandry, on the plan of 
Jethro Tull; in which he has ever fince perlevered 
with unfailing fteadinefs, railing crops of wheat, barley, and 
beans, in drilk without a particle of dung, always following 
the intervals, (about 3 feet,) for each lucceeding crop; and 
thus compleatly demonftrating the effecl: of" cultivation with- 
out the ufe of manure. Although every operation has been 
performed with the niceft accuracy; and in its proper feafon, 
and though the foil of Sherriffmiln feems to be well calcu* 
lated for this kind of hufbandry, being light and fandy, yet 
the refult has not been fiich as to encourage imitation. The 
corn is indeed fuperior in quality to any in the country; 
but the quantity by the acre much lejs than is raifed in the 

broad- 

and a gardener in Elgin, who had been bred in London, was 
employed to cur. the grafs, and overfee the hay, for the fcythc 
was then little known, and could not be ufed.

broad-caft way, on the fame kind of foil, well plowed and 
manured. The average rent, per acre, is about r 5 s. the 
clay land letting at 1 I. the fandy foils at about 10 s. and 
thofe of the intermediate qualities from 14 s. to 17 s. the 
acre*. Although the clay land in general produces large 
crops, yet, on account of the additional expence which at- 
tends the management of it, it is not by many reckoned the 
moft profitable ; as the labour of this foil is often fufpended 
for a great part of the winter, and in the beginning of fpring, 
while all the neceflary operations of that fcafon are diligently 
profecuted on the drier lands. 

Improvements. 

* In this parifh, and generally in the whole parifhes of the 
country, the land-lords drew a victual rent ; and this prac- 
tife continued till Lord Fife introduced a converfion at 1 2 and 
iz s. 6 d, per boll. If the ancient rents were exafted, ip/is cor- 
fonbus, it would be found, that, on the average value of grain, 
the prefent rents would not much exceed the rents eflablifhed 
170 or 200 years ago. For, by the valuation of teinds, anno 
j 629, Spynie, on the one end of the parifh, : is then rented at 108 
bolls, and now pays the heritor, exclufive of the precinfl or 
bifhops part, 72 1. Sterling. The farm of SherrifFmiln, then 
rented at 50 bolls, now pays 48 1. In the vicinity of the town 
of Elgin, and in the other part of the parifh, Kintrae was given 
up, anno 1629, at the yearly rent of 130 bolls of victual, and 
recently fet by Lord Fife at 1 18 1. 14 s. of money, and 20 bolls 
of wheat. This, reckoned with the firft quality of foil in the 
country, is about 20 s. per acre ; which, eftimating the value of 
a boll at 16 s. proves, that the prefent reddendo fcarcely exceeds 
the ancient exaeYion ; and likewife fhows, whether the farmer has 
improved the method of cultivation, for he has no other fource, 
but the prices of cattle, which, in the memory of man, have 
been tripled in value. If the cafe were otherwife, the tenant 
ftill could not pay, nor the land-lord receive, the ftipulated 
rents exigible 170 years ago. — It alfo proves that vicinal, then 
valued at 5 1. Scotch the boll, has not been doubled, when every 
other article of life has been doubled, tripled, and quadrupled. 
Servants wages, in this parifh, 40 years ago, v/ere, for a plough- 
man, 10I. Scotch half yearly, now 30 1. ; and exceeding it ia 
many parts of the country.

Improvements.— The induftry of the farmer will often in- 
creale the value of a farm, where the fluggard will ftarve. A 
remarkable inftance of this occurs in the improvement of the 
farm of Murrayfton, which was poffefled by Mr James Dun- 
can, and held by 4 tenants, at the low rent of 70 bolls, in the 
year 1764, when they all became bankrupts. The land- 
holder then adapted his converfion for 19 years to Mr Do- 
naldfon, who exerted much induftry, and improved the 
farm greatly. On his refignation, Mr Duncan entered at 
an advanced rent of 10 1. He lives as comfortably as Mr 
Donaldfon did; and now, befides the profits of his crop, 
by attention to the dairy alone, draws, for milk and butter, 
150 1. yearly. — It may be obferved, that the farm of Burrow- 
brigs was, 170 years ago, only rented at 18 bolls of victual*; 
but now it rents at 100 1. Sterling, owing to its vicinity to 
the burrow lands of Elgin. As a farther evidence of what 
the grounds, by proper cultivation, may produce, Mr Ruf- 
fell, the proprietor of Wellfield, has let his eftate in lots of 
from 20 to 40 acres, and built houfes for the inhabitants, 
whereby he gets a rent of from 30 s. to 40 s. per acre. So

that this eftate, bought Tome years ago at 6000 1. draws now 
more than 400 1. annually. 

Cattle. — There are 201 horles and 560 black cattle in the 
parifh, befides 14 large oxen, which go in pairs either in the 
plough or wain. Before the moor was planted, almoft every 
tenant had a fmall flock of fheep ; but now there are not 
above 200 fheep in the pari fh : And thefe are chiefly of a 
fmall white-faced breed, which has been in this country 
from time immemorial. There is little attention paid to the 
breeding or improvement of black cattle, except by a few of 
the gentlemen, who alone turn this branch of hufbandry to 
any account. 

Rent and Proprietors. — The valued rent is 3055 1. 3 s. 8 d. 
Scotch *, which is divided among 5 heritors, exclufive of the 
precinct of Spynie, belonging, as was faid, to the Crown. 
Betides the farm of Spynie, the Earl of Fife holds all the 
lands in the north and weft, except the eftate of Weftfield, 
the property of Francis Russel, Efq; of Blackhall, Ad- 
vocate. The Earl of Findlater holds the lands of Bur- 
roughbridge, lying between the Loflie and the town of El- 
gin \ as well as the lands of Greenhall, Myrefide, and Bifhop- 
miln, in the eaft, between Spynie and Elgin ■ James Miln, 
Efq; having only the milns of Biftiopmiln, with a fmall con- 
tiguous property. And the Lesslies of Findraflie have 
long pofiefied that eftate, on the fide of the lake, between 
the properties of the two Earls. 

Population. 

« By the old valuation roll of this county, in the year 1667, 
the real rent is' laid to have been 198,217!. 13 s. Scotch,

Population. — The population feems to have decreafed in 
the courfe of the laft 30 years. Although there are no ve- 
ry large farms in the parifh (there being only one that ex- 
ceeds 100 acres), yet there are feveral, in which, within that 
period, one tenant has fucceeded to 405. It is probable, that 
the population may be ftill a little farther diminifhed, as 
nearly one half of the parifh confifts of farms from 20 to 
40 acres, which the proprietors may through time fee pro- 
per to lay out in larger tenements.

Manufactures — The only manufactory of this parifh is 
that erected by Mr John Ritchie, merchant in Elgin. In the 
eaftmoft part of this parifh', on the river of Loffie, within a 
half mile of the town of Elgin, he has built on a feu belong- 
ing to him, a mill for the manufactory of tobacco, a waulk- 
n ill, a flax mill, and bleaching machinery, which has brought 
to great perfection the bleaching of linens and thread ; and 
he is, with great affiJuity, giving every hope of bringing thefe 
uieful and laudable inventions to perfection. 

Fuel. 



* Thefe averages are taken from the parifh regifler, from 
1784 to 1790, inclufive, a period in which it appears to have 
been very txaclly kept. 



6tf Statijlical Account 



Fuel. — Coals mny now be had at fo moderate a price, and 
in a few years there will alfo be fuch abundance of wood, 
that it is hardly necefTary to notice the prefent fcarcity of 
fuel for domeftic accommodation. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — The church and manfe were moft 
pleafantly fituated at the eaftern extremity, in the vicinity of 
the Caftle, until the year '730", when they were removed to 
ghtarryivood, a more centrical, though more bleak fituation, 
nearly under the higheft part of the north fide of the hill. 
Both are at prefent in pretty good repair ; and the glebe 
and garden, confining of about 6 acres, are both fubftan- 
tially incloled with ftone walls. The ftipend, including 60 
merks for communion elements, is 30 1. Sterling, and 64 
bolls of bear. 

Antiquities. — The remains of a Banifh camp * are ftill 
very confpicuons on the hill of £tiarryivood. It would ap- 
pear that thofe Danes, who inhabited the burgh ( burges ) 
in this neighbourhood, had erected it as an afylum for their 
families. It commands a view of the whole county, and a 
pleafant profpect into the counties of Caithnefs, Sutherland, 
llofs, Invernefs, Nairn, Banff, and Aberdeen. It is worthy 
of Lord Fyfe's notice, and becoming his tafte, in beautifying 
the county, to renew this monument, and perpetuate its an- 
tiquity. 

Advantages. 

* Both Fordon and Buchanan give account of the Danes 
landing in Murray, about the year 1008, when Malcolm II. 
inarched againfl them, fought, and was defeated at Forres. 
In the career of their fuccefs, they fent for their families, who 
enjoyed the land till they were repeatedly defeated at Gamerie 
in Banff-fhire, and Cruden in Buchan, where the Danifti camps 
are ftill to be fecn.

■Advantages.*— One great advantage, which this pari^ in a 
pt culiar manner enjoys, is the abundance of ftone !o well 
adapted both for building and inclofing; of which, however, 
the inhabitants have not yet availed then.fnvcs in any great 
degree. Befides this, no part of the parifti js inconvenient- 
ly diftant from either of the harbours of Loffieniouth or 
Findhorn, or the markets of Elgin, to which laft there is at 
all times an uninterrupted accefs by a handfome ttone bi idge, 
where the poft-road to Forres crolTes the Loflie, about the 
middle of the fouth fide of the parifli. 

Language. — The language of the parifh is the Scotch dia- 
lect. Some of the names of places are evidently Gaelic, 
fuch as Kintrae, Infiagarty* , ( Innis-ant-Jliagairt J, the Leggat 9 
(an lag-fhad), &amp;c. And it is highly probable that many 
more of them are of Gaelic origin, though they are now 
corrupted or difguifed fo much, by having been fo long ir* 
the mouths of Lowlanders, that it is hardly poffible for a 
Highlander to recognize them for his native tongue. 

CharaBer^ SsV. — The people are ihduftrious and frugal, pot 
fefling alfo other virtues, not fo much the necefTary confe- 
quence of their fituation ; being in general honeft, benevo- 
lent and friendly, and entertaining a high refpecT: for thf 
ordinances of religion. The drefs of the poorer tenants and 
day-labourers is of the cheapeft kind, chiefly of home ma- 
nufacture; that of the more fubltantial farmers, and their 
fervants, is purchafed from the fhops of Elgin.
