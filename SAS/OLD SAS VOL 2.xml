HE publication of the Statiftical Account of 



Scotland, notwithftanding all the afiiftance 
that could poffibly be procured, is attended with much 
greater difficulties, than can well be conceived. Yet, 
had it been the means, of producing alone, the valua- 
ble information, contained in the following pages, it 
is impoffible, that any one, poflHTed of the leaft par- 
ticle of public fpirit, could have confidered his time 
and labour mifapplied. For, it is believed, that there 
is no work, now extant, which throws fuch light up- 
on the actual ftate of human fociety, or furnilhes fo 
many ufeful hints, of the moft likely means of pro- 
moting its happinefs and improvement. 

Among the other fubjecls of importance, which 
the reader will have the fatisfaction of finding pretty 
clearly explained, in the courfe of the following pa- 
pers, there is one point which merits to be particular- 
ly attended to, namely, the proofs, which they con- 
tain, that the Population of Scotland, within thefe 
4oyears paft,hasconfiderably increafed. Though the 
progrefs of improvement in the country, might have

fatisfied every individual, of that fad, yet, iuch is 
the bias in favour of former times, that nothing, 
but a fair comparifon,foundedon accurate furveys, at 
different periods, could have produced full conviction, 
in the minds of many. It is a fortunate circum- 
ftance, therefore, that the late ingenious and learn- 
ed Dr Webfter, was employed, many years ago, in 
limilar inq;*i ies ; and, that he drew up, in 5755, at 
the defire of the. late Prelident Dundas, for the in- 
formation and the fervice of Government, an ac- 
count of the number of people in Scotland. In his 
introduction to that account *, he ftates, " that he

ever, feveral copies of it, in manulcript, in private hands ; 
and the mod material parts of the information it contains, 
will be inferted, in the courfe of this work. It may be fuf- 
ficient, at prefent, to give the following ftatement, drawn up 
by that accurate calculator, of the ages of the inhabitants of 
Scotland, in 1755-

, ( had eftablifhed, in 1743, a general correlpond- 
" ence, both with clergy and laity, for preparing a 
" fcheme, which was afterwards ratified by Parlia- 
" liament, for a provifion for minifters widows : 
" That he had improved that correfpondence, for 
" the purpofe of procuring lifts, either of individuals, 
,; or, of perfons above a certain age, in the difFe- 
" rent parimes of Scotland : That, when the lifts 
11 contained only thofe above a certain age, he pal* 
v culated the amount of the whole inhabitants, by 
" the proportion, which they might be fuppofed 
" to bear, to the number of fouls, according to the 
molt approved tables, compared with the fact in 
" many parts of Scotland, where the minifters, at 
" his defire, not only numbered their parifhioners, 
" but diftinguilhed their refpedtive ages : So that, 
H it is humbly apprehended, the account he has giv- 
" en, of the number of the people, is fufficiently 
" exact to anfwer every valuable purpofe." Doctor 
Webller's well known character for accuracy, and 
the fuccefs, with which his calculations have been 
uniformly attended, ought to fatisfy every one, that 
the report he drew up may be fafely relied on; and 
above all, he had every inducement to mate the po- 
pulation of Scotland rather large, than otherwife; 
fince the report was to be laid before the Govern- 
ment at the time, in whofe eyes, he would natural- 
ly be inclined to place his native country, in as fa- 
vourable and refpectable a light as poffible. 

It 



C vlli ) 

It is much to be regretted, that it was found im- 
practicable, to include a greater number of parimes, 
in this volume. It contains, however, fo many im- 
portant diftri&amp;s, that the accounts could not, with 
any degree of propriety, be rendered more concife. 
There is reafon, however, to believe, that, in future, 
every volume will contain from 80 to ieo parimes; 
fo that, the whole work will be contained in about 
ten volumes. It now can hardly be doubted, that it 
will prove the completer! furvey of a kingdom, of 
which we have any knowledge ; and, at the fame 
time, will not exceed, either in price, or bulk, the 
topographical accounts given of many individual 
counties in England. 

Nothing, therefore, is wanting, but a little far- 
ther perfeverance and exertion, on the part of the 
clergy of Scotland, to complete a work, — which 
will be a monument of their own induftry and abi- 
lities ; — which will promote the improvement of 
their country, more rapidly than can be effected by 
any other means ; — and avhich, by giving more 

AUTHENTIC INFORMATION, REGARDING THE IN- 
TERNAL STRUCTURE OF POLITICAL SOCIETY, THAN 
EVER WAS KNOWN BEFORE, MAY VERY MATERIALLY' 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE OEMERAL HAPPINESS OF THE 

SPECIES.

CALCULATION. 

IT appears, on the whole, that in 50 country parifhes in 
Scotland, taken indifcriminately, from one end of the king- 
dom to the other, there is an increafe, fmce 1755, of 10,5 17 
fouls; which is at the rate of 210 to a parifh, or 189,000 in 
the 900 country parifhes of North Britain : And, as the great 
towns (Edinburgh, Glafgow, Paifley, Aberdeen, Dundee^ 
&amp;c.) have probably increafed to the amount of 210,000, the 
total increafe in Scotland, in lefs than 40 years, will be 
about 400,000, and the total population about 1,700,000 
fouls.

<head>NUMBER I. 
    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7827287">TORTHORWALD</name>, 

(COUNTY OF DUMFRIES.)  

By the Rev. Mr. James M'Millan.</head> 

<p>Origin of the Name, Situation, &amp;c. 
*T^ORTHORWALD, the prefent name of the parifh, 19 
fuppofed to fignify the Tower of Thor in the wood. 
The name is evidently of Saxon original, and derived from 
Thor, the Jupiter of the Saxon deities. It lies in the county, 
prefbytery, and fynod of Dumfries. It is bounded by the 
parifhes of Moufwald on the S. of Lochmaben on the E. of 
Tinwald on the N. and N. W. and of Dumfries on the S. W. 
The weftern part of the parifh is very low, being part of that 
extenfive tract known by the name of Lochar Mofs : Next to 
this are paftures and meadows, frequently overflowed : Then 
fandy ground of various breadth ; to the eaft a fine till 
foil, about a mile broad: Then green and arable braes, 
banks, and hillocks, interfperfed with wet clay grounds and 
moors. At the eaftern extremity of the parifh, the ground

rifes in high black hills ; one, called the Beacon hill, affords 
perhaps the moft extenfive view, round the horizon, of any 
rifing ground in this part of the country, Crifftl excepted* 
There are about 4400 acres, including 900 cf mofs, in the 
parifh-, the inhabited part of which, with the exception of a 
few fcattered families, is a fquare of 2^ miles, in the middle 
of which ftand the cattle, the manfe, and the church. 

River and Mofs. — The river Lochar, which, for 7 miles, 
divides this parifh from that of Dumfries, is about 25 feet 
broad at a medium \ and fo much on a level, in its courfe through 
Lochar Mofs, that it has a defcent of only 1 1 feet in that fpace, 
which meafures 12 miles in a direct line. It contains pike, 
perch, trout, and eel ; fome of the pike weigh 20 lbs. fome 
eels 3 lbs. and a few of the trout 5 lbs. Several otters fre- 
quent this river, and make great havock among the pike. 
Wild duck and teal abound here all the year round, and 
many wild geefe vifit this place in ftormy winters. A few 
fwans alfo come hither, and feveral bitterns and herons. In 
the adjacent mofs and meadows, curlews, plovers, and moor- 
fowl breed. Lochar mofs*, it is well known, is a tract of 12 
miles in length, and betwixt 2 and 3 in breadth, extending down 
to Sohvay firth. That this mofs was once an arm of the fea, 
appears from feveral circumftances : Sea-fand and fleech are 
found at the bottom j and fometimes boats, almoft entire, with 
anchors, cables, and oars. Tinwaid ifles, at the N. W. extre- 
mity of the parifh, are faid, in a Spanifh hiftory, to have been 
the befl harbour in Scotland and Dumfries, which lies at the 
hack of the mofs, lias been tranflated by Latin hiflorians, Dor- 
fum freti, the back of the firth. There is a faying common

Oak, fir, birch, and hazel-trees, the latter with nuts and hulks, 
are frequently dug up in many parts of the mofs : Several of 
thefe trees are very large and frefh, and arc applied by car- 
penters to various purpofes of their trade. Fragments of the 
firs are cut in fmall pieces, and ufcd for kindling fires ; they 
burn amazingly, and are frequently carried to Dumfries for 
that purpofe. This niofs is bounded on the eaft by four pa- 
rifhes, Tinwald, Torthorwald, Moufwald, and Ruthwald, all 
terminating in nvald, which in the Saxon fignifies a wood. 
It is a tra£l of above 12 miles in length, generally fine land, 
about 2 miles broad, of a gentle weftern expofurc, which 
muff., from its good properties, have been early cultivated, 
and indeed it is reported to have been antiently the place of 
the greateft refort in the country. 

Climate and Difeafes. — From 1764 to 1 790, a period of 27 
years, 135 males, and 145 females, in all 280 individuals, 
have died in this parilh^ 54 of whom were between 70 and 8c, 
and 46 above 80 years of age, fo that the climate, it fhould 
feem, is very healthy, and favourable to longevity. In re- 
gard to the prevailing diftempers, that will beft appear from 
the tables of mortality, during the period above-mentioned, to 
be inferted in the appendix. 

Proprietors, &amp;c. — There are only two heritors, the Duke of 
Queenfberry, and Sir Piobert Grierfon, of Lag, neither of 
whom refide. The rental of the parifh in 1756, was 
L. 610:8:8; in 1790 it amounted to L. 1357; and in 
1791 rofe to L. 1850. The beft croft land fets at 21s. 22s. 
and 23s. per acre, fometimes more; the fecond beft at 15s. 
the third beft at 10s. The rent of a common houfe is not a- 
bove 1 os. at an averrge -, but then the tenants are bound to

uphold them. No houfes are unoccupied. The land in ge- 
neral is better calculated for grain than paflure. A good deal 
of clover and rye grafs is raifed; but the mode of cultivation hi- 
therto ufed, is rather of the old than of the new and moft ap- 
proved kind. Formerly the farmerswere accuftomed to pay their 
rents by their big or bear crops, andby felling peats in Dumfries; 
but, for 20 years part, they have in a great meafure given up 
the fale of peats ; and of late have taken to fowing barley 
inftead of bear. Oats and barley are their chief grains they 
raife but little wheat, peafe, rye, and fcavcely any turnips. A 
large quantity of potatoes is annually raifed, and this is the on- 
ly article by which the grounds are cleaned, fallow being very 
feldom pra&amp;ifed. Till about 1770 the farmers of Torthor- 
wald and Roucan had a confiderable pare of their lands at a 
diftance from their dwellings ; on this account the late Duke 
of Queenfberry removed no lefs than 25 farmers from thefe 
villages to themore remote parts of the parifh, where good farm 
houfes were erected ; for which, his Grace gave them confi- 
derable affiftance, and at the fame time inclofed almofl his 
whole grounds with ftone dikes and thorn hedges, at the ex- 
pence of above L. 2000. The thorns have generally fucceedeci, 
but the ftone of which the dikes were built, being of the flatey 
kind, they have fallen down very much. The late Sir Wil- 
liam Griei fon, of Lag, was fo attentive to have his lands clear 
of weeds, that he held goo! (chryfanthemum) ccurls as long ns 
he lived, for the purpofe of fining the farmers, on whofe 
growing crop three heads cr upwards of that weed were found. 

"Implements of Hujbaudn,and Manures. — About 1750, there 
were very few carts in the parifh, trail cars being then gene- 
rally ufed for leading goods ; dung was carried out in creels ; 
hay led in trufTes ; and peats in large facks, upon horfes backs ; 
luit, for 1 a confiderable time pad, carts have been ufed for ailthefa 

purpefeg,

purpofes, fothat there are now 88 in the parifh; there are alfo 44 
ploughs of the ordinary kind, drawn by 2 horfes each. Lime 
from Comlongan, 8 miles diftance, is much ufed as a manure, 
and with good effect. Marie was formerly found on the edge 
of Torthorwald moor, but the pit is now exhaufted. 

Prices of Proviftons and Labour. — Theprefent prices of provi- 
fions and labour are the fame as in Tinwald and Holywood pa- 
rifhes. — In 1730 the common half yearly wages of a male 
houfe fervant, were 22s 6d. in 1739, they were 23s. in 1744, 

and for feveral years afterwards, 30s. and a pair of {hoes. . 

The ordinary wages of a women fervant, for the fame fpace, 

were then 10s. At thefe periods, including victuals, a 

Wright's daily wages was 6d. a taylor's 4d. a labourer's 3d. or 

4d. a mower's, is A hen fold for 4d. (now for yd) — eggs 

i|d. the dozen, — butter at 4d. per. lib. of 24 oz.— pork, 4d. 
per. lib. of 16 oz. (the fame price it bears at prefent, becaufe it 
was formerly very fcarce) — an ordinary beef cow at Mar- 
tinmas, 2 guineas, — a good kg of lamb, ;d. — an ordinary 
leg of mutton, i^d. — The bed horfe in the parifh, in 1 749, was 
fold for feven guineas. 

MifcelLvteous' ' Obfrvations. — Several in the parifh employ 
•themfelves in fpinning factory-yarn, both lint and tow *. — . 
There are four licenfed alehoufes in the parifh, to which, 
for the moft part idle and loofe perfons refort to drink 
whilky. Thefe houfes greatly hurt the morals of many, and 
in various refpecls deeply injure tbe interefts of the country. 
Every effort of the legiflature, fhould, therefore, be ufed to 
reduce their numbers, and to keep them under the fhicleft dif 

cipline.

cipiine. — The great military road from Gretna, to Dumfries 
and Fort Patrick, paffes through the fouth part of the parifh, 
and a toll-bar was erected on it laft year. A turnpike road 
from Dumfries to Loch maben goes through the center of thepa- 
lifh, on which the firft toll-bar fet up in Nithfdale, was placed 
in 17S9. The ftatute labour in this parifh is commuted for 
L. : 5 per. annum. — There are plenty of good fprings 
and running water in the parifh,. A well in the moor of 
Torthorwald, fuppofed to be of the chalybeate kind, is reckon- 
ed falutary in fcorbutic diforders, and in gravellifh complaints. 
There is abundance of peats in the parifh, but no coal. 

JLccleftaJlical State, Poor, £jV. — The church, which was built in 
1782, at the expence of above L. 400, will contain 500 per* 
fons, and is well executed. The manfe was built in 1738. 
The ftipend, as augmented in 1756, amounts to L.70. per 
annum, including L. 3 : 6 : 8, for communion elements ; and 
the minifter has alfo a glebe of above 10 acres, valued at 
L. 1 1 per. annum. The duke of Quecnlberry is patron. The 
poor do not exceed 4, 5, or 6 in number, and are fupplied 
quarterly at the rate of 5s or 6s each, in ordinary cafes; but 
fome of them occafionally get a great deal more. The col- 
lections for their fupport are about L. 7 per annum, with the 
intereft of a fund of L. 150, which is increafing every year. 
— The annual falary of the parochial fchoolmafter, including 
the intereft of a capital of L. 210, is L. 17:14:5!, befides 
fees for teaching. There have been 80 fcholars at one 
time, at this fchool in the winter feafon ; but of late it has not 
been fo full as ufual, a private fchool having been fet up in the 
village of Roucan.

Stattftkal Account 



Of married women, there are only three barren, two of 
whom are fillers. Since 1756, ten women have had twins, of 
whom feven lived in the parifh of Torthorwald. Of the 14 
aged perfons in the parifh, 3, anno 1790, were in the 80th 
year of their age, and the reft 80 and upwards. Of thefe, 5 
were men, and 9 women. One of the men was born in Feb- 
ruary, 1697. 

Number of Horfes, &amp;c. — There, are, in the parifh, 1 20 hor- 
fes ; 650 head of black cattle ; 280 common, or fmall fheepi 
principally fed on the hills, (about 30 on the farm of Drum- 
moor excepted), and fmall parcels of petts, as they are com- 
monly called, or half mugs, which run among the milk cows, 
greatly to the injury of the cow pafture, and to the ruin of the 
low ftone dikes, and thorn hedges. 

Antiquities. — This parifh, was, it fhould feem, of fome mi- 
litary confequence, 

" In ancient time, when Britain's trade was arms, 
" And the lov'd mufic of her youth alarms :" 
For it contained a caftle, and two Britifh camps, the veftiges of 
which are ftill confpicuous. The former, laid, by tradition, 
to have been erected by a Ihoemaker, in the parifh, named 
.Skrimple, or Skriry-hard-fcraes, by means of a treafure he 

found whilft digging his garden. It is ftill ftanding, 

though in a ruinous condition. The fituation is beautiful, 
on the top of a fmall bank. It is fuppofed to have been built 
in the thirteenth century ; and appears to have been very 
ftrongly fortified. The two camps are fituated about a mile 
diftant from each other, one to the weft, and the other to 
the eaft of the caftle, each being about 30 yards in diameter ; 
furrounded in fome parts with two, and in other places with 

three

three, large trenches. In Torthorwald moor there Is 3 cairn ; 
and a ring or circle formed of final! ftones. 

Chara&amp;er } &amp;c. of the People. — The inhabitants of this parifh 
are generally very fober, honeft, and induflrious; and live com- 
fortably and at an eafy rate. They feed much on potatoes 
and on pork. It is very common for the cottagers to buy a 
pig, which theyfattcnup for fome months, and then kill. A few 
of the men are fix feet high, and fome above that ftature; a 
conficlcrable number are greatly above the common fize; and 
their complexion is tolerable. None enlift in the army ; but 
feveral enter into the navy. In 1750, five farmers emigrated 
from this parifh to the ifle of Bute, where they engaged in 
farms, but about 10 years afterwards, 3 of them returned to 
Torthorwald and the neighbourhood. This parifh has pro- 
duced 10 preachers of the gofpel fince 1762. Many young 
men have gone abroad in different lines, feveral of whom have 
been fuccefsful, and have done honour to the place of their 
nativity. 

Bills of Mortality. — In forming the tables of mortality, (fee 
appendix) it was intended, in as far as confifted with accuracy, 
to prefcrvethe common names by which the difeafes are known. 
Where thefe are either not fufficiently diftinctive, or where one 
name is ufed to exprefs more than one kind of difeafe, num- 
bers" are added exprefive of the genus they belong to inCullen's 
Nofology. No difeafes are mentioned for children under 
one year of age, unlefs they have died of the fmall pox, mea- 
fles, or chincoucdi, and therefore they are put into one column, 
The column marked " Internal chronic complaints, &amp;c." are 
Cafes where no other definite name could be thought of, and 
where they are in general thought to arife from obftru&amp;ions 
B 2 of

of fomc of the vifcera. Many of them under this head had 
been bed-rid for a long time before they died. 

Obfervations on the Tables of Mortality. — It appears fromthefe 
tables, that the afthma, which carried off 36 fouls, has been 
the moil prevalent diftemper, and that 1 8 have died of rheu- 
jnatic complaints, within the fame period. The uncommon 
mortality of thefe difeafes was occafiofied by a great number 
of the inhabitants having been in the practice of employing the 
greater part of the fummer, and even a good part of winter, 
flrlt in making, and then in carrying peats from the mofs to 
their own houfes, and for fale in Dumfries. In this (employ- 
ment, befides being expofed to the vicimtudes of the weather, 
the labourers generally had their legs foaked in mofs water al- 
moft all the day ; and, as they performed this work, not for 
wages, but on their own account, they conftantly wrought 
feveral extra hours, at a diftance from their own homes, and 
without the convenience of warm victuals, &amp;c. Under thefe 
circumftances, the frequency and malignity of the afthma and 
the rheumatifm need not be wondered at ; and the unheal- 
thinefs of this fpecies of labour is a ftrong argument, in addi- 
tion to many others that might be adduced, for abolifhing the 
duty on coal ; fo as to render that fort of fuel, fo deftrudtive 
to the health, as well as to the induftry of the people, no 
longer neceffary. 

In 1776, inoculation for the fmall pox was fiift introduced 
into this parifh, and that practice has fince been conti- 
nued, always with fafety to the perfons inoculated, though 
fatal to thofe who were infected by it in the natural way 
from the inoculated. Hence in twelve years preceding 1 776, 
only two perfons died here of the fmall-pcx, whilft in

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5298138">DORNOCK</name>. 

(COUNTY OF DUMFRIES.) 

By the Rev. Mr. James Smaill.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, 5sV. 
T"\ORNOCK is a fmall parifh, lying in the prefbytery of An- 
nan, in the fynod and the fhire of Dumfries. It is 
two miles and a half in length, and in general about two and 
a half in breadth. It would be nearly fquare, were it not for 
a final! detached part, confiding of three farms, almoft quite 
unconnected with the reft of the parifh, lying along the banks 
of the Kirtle. It is bounded by the parifh of Annan on the 
weft and north, by Kirkpatrick-Fleming on the north eaft, 
by Gretna oa the eaft, and by the Solway Firth on the fouth. 
Its name is probably derived from the oak woods, that former- 
ly grew there. Tor or Dor, in the Celtic language, fignify- 
iig, an oak, or wood, and nock, a know, or hill. The parilh, 
however, is remarkably level, having no mountains, and few ri- 
fjng grounds 60 feet above high-water mark. The foil is in gene- 
ral fertile and produces very good crops when properly cultivated. 
But the greater part of the parifh, confifteth of loam upon a 
ftony clay, or brick earth. So clofs a bottom makes it rather a 
damp country in winter. The air is healthy, though rather 
moift and chilly. There are no local diftempers peculiar to 
the diftrict. Confumptions fomerimes prevail, and occauonjl-

ly fevers and the fmall-pox ; the lad of which is rendered 
much lefs fatal Gnce inoculation has been fo generally pTao 
tifed. 

Rivers, Fi/bit:gs, — The fmall river, Kirtle, touches the 
north eaft point of the parilh, and the Solway Firth, or Boo- 
nefs Wath, as it is called, is its fouthern boundery *. In the 
Kirtle, there are fome common trouts, eels, pike, perch, and 
the like ; but thefe are not in fuch quantities as to be an objecl 
of much profit to the inhabitants. The fifhings in theSolwaf 
Firth, however, are more confiderable, and merit a more par- 
ticular detail, both on account of the income they produce, 
and the fingular modes of filhing, which are adopted ; a de- 
scription of which, may furnilh ufeful hints to proprietors in 

other parts of the kingdom. The modes are four. 1 . With 

leifters : a kind of four pronged fork, with the prongs turner} 
a little to one fide, having a {haft 20 or 24 feet long. Thefe 
they run along the fand on their edge, or throw them when 
they fee any filh. In this manner they often wound and ki'i 
great quantities. Some of our people are very dexterous at 
this exercife, and will fometimes upon horfeback throw a 
leifter, and kill at a great diftance. This is.alfo called JJjauling; 
as it is generally prac~tifed, when the tide is almoft fpent, and 
the waters turned fhallow. — 2. A fecond mode of filhing, called 
haaving or hauling) is Handing in the dream, either at the flow- 
ing or ebbing of the tide, with a pock net fixed to a kind cf frame, 
con filling of a beam, 12 or 14 feet long, having three fmall 
flicks or rungs fixed into it, one in the middle, and one at each 
endj about four feet long each ; to thefe the net is fixed 

by 

* Wath feems to fignify a ford, or place that may be ford- 
id ov waded,

by a fmall line ; and with this frame they ftand, having the 
mouth of the net, which is fixed to the frame, oppofed to the 
ftream, and the points of the rungs fixed upon the bottom, 
holding firmly the middle of the beam : fo that, whenever a 
fifh ftrikes againft the net, they, by means of the middle rung, 
inftantly haul up the mouth of the net above water, and the 
filh which lies caught in the pock or hollow of the net, they 
kill with an inftrument kept for that purpofe. A dozen or 
twenty men will fometimts go in, and ftand a-breaft in the 
ftream, at this kind of fifhing, up to the middle, in ftrong run- 
ning water, for three or four hours together. A company 
of this kind is called a Mell 3. Another method is cal- 
led pock-net fjbifig : This is performed by fixing ftakes or flours 
(as they are called) in the fatid, either in the channel of the ri- 
ver, or in the fand which is dry at low water. Thefe ftours 
are fixed in a line, acrofs the tide-way, at the diftance of 40 
inches from each other, about 3 feet high above the fand, and 
between every two of thefe ftours is fixed a pock-net, tied by a 
rope to the top of each ftour. The under part of the net is 
made faft to a hank or ring, made of twilled willow or hazle, 
znd flipt on to the ftour on which it is moveable. Thefe pock- 
nets are made of ftrong twine, and the mouths^of them are a- 
bout 3 feet wide both ways : They are of a wide mefh, fo that 
the filh coming up rapidly with the ftream, inftantly run 
their heads into one of thefe mefhes, where they ftick, and fo 
are unable to difengage themfelves ; and as foon as the tide is, 
fpent, the fifhermen go in and cake them. Five of thefe pocks 
are called a clout ; and ten clout of nets are the quantity al- 
lowed to each fifherman, who has only one fhare in the fiflt- 
ing. They have alfo the diftances regulated, fo that one fifher- 
man muft not fet his nets within a certain diftance of another. 

4. The fourth method is called raife-net f'fo'mg. This 
is by far the molt profitable mode, yielding a rent of from 2 
2, to

to L. 300 a year, within the bounds of this parifh. It is fo cal- 
led, from the lower part of the net rifing and floating upon 
the water with the flowing tide, and fetting down with the 
ebb. This is alfo called lake-fiflnng, from the nets being al- 
ways fet in lakes, or hollow parts of the tide-way, and never 
either in the channel of the river, or on the plain fand. The 
ltakes or Hours ufed for thefe nets, are in general, 10 or 12 
feet long, and fixed in a row, acrofs a lake, or hollow, at 
about 5 or 6 feet diftance. After thefe are ttrongly fattened to 
the bottom, by being driven pretty deep into the fand, a 
ftrong rope is palled along, and fixed to the head of each ftour ; 
to this rope is fixed a net of about 9 or 10 feet deep, bound al- 
io at the bottom with a ftrong rope, but not fattened to the 
flours below. In the middle between every two flours, is 
fattened to the upper rope, a fmall ftick about the fize of thofe 
ufed by coopers for hoops to large vefiels, and about 12 feet 
long. The other end of thefe flicks are faftened to the foot 
rope of the net which keeps it quite tight, the lower end 
of courfe, rifes with the net, and floats on the water with the 
flowing tide : but, when the tide begins to turn, thefe fticks 
are prefled down to the bottom by the returning or back- 
going ftream, and fo take the net along with them, and pre- 
vent any fiih getting clown the lake, till the tide is fpent or 
gone out, when the filhermen, or the perfons to whom the 
nets belong, come every 12 hours to fee what is left. But if 
the lake does not ebb quite dry, they have to draw the lake 
with a draught-net, to take out the fiih. In this manner, great 
quantities of falrnon, fea-trout, nerrings, cod, flounders, 
fturgeoa, &amp;c. are fornetimes taken. 

The fiih caught here are inftantly fold, and almoft, always 
for ready money. Fiih carriers are conftantly waiting at the 
drawing of the nets, in order to buy and carry away the fifh, 
as foon as they are taken. They carry them to the large manu-

fachiring towns, in the north and weft of England ; and (oms 

of them are fent even to London. The falmon is fold from 

is. per. lb. down to 2-^d. according to the feafon of the year, 
and the fcarcity of fifh. The herrings and fea-trou:s are fold 
in proportion, rather at a lower rate. Cod are generally fold 
at Carlifle and the neighbourhood, at about i^d. or 2d. per. lb. 
The flounders are bought by the dozen, at from 4d. to is. ac- 
cording to their fize and fcarcity. In July, 1789, there was a 
confiderable herring fifhing, but we feldom have them in fuch 
quantities, as to merit much attention. 

The Solway firth is navigable at high water, for veffels of 
ico tons burden, five or fix miles to the eaftward of this j 
and veffels may ly in fafety any where alone the fhore, being 
all flat fand, without rocks. The tides are pretty regular. Spring 
tJes rife about 25 feet above low-water mark, and ordinary 
tides about 10 or 12. There are evident marks of the 
tides having been higher at fome diftant period upon tln3 
coaft than they are at prefent, by at leaft 20 feet. 

Minerals. — When the great military road was making 
through this parifh, a great quantity of matter was dug up 
from a field, and ufed for gravelling the road, which had all 
the appearance of a vitrified fubftance or kind of lava. There 
are very good quarries of red free ftone, and fome muir or 
whinftone, which are ufed both for building dykes and houfes. 
No lime-ftone or coal has as yet been difcovered in this 
parifh ; nor has any trial of confequence been made to dif- 
cover them. The want of coal is truly diftreffing to 
ihc country in general, both in regard to agriculture and 
manufactures. As to lime, it can be obtained in the neigh- 
bourhood. 

Cattle, tfl-.—A good many black cattle, (about 700 head in 



cf Dor nock. 



ali) are reared irrfte parifh, principally of the Galloway breed, 
being reckoned more eafily fattened than any other. There 
are about 145 horfes, moftly of the draught kind. The fheep 
do not exceed 160 in number; and little or no pains is taken* 
to improve the breed. There are about 300 fwine, fatted an- 
nually. They are moftly falted, made into hams, and fent 
into England. There are, one year with another, about 960 
acres in tillage ; of which, about 200 are fown with barley, 600 
with oats, 40 with peafe and beans, 20 with wheat, 20 
with rye, 60 with potatoes, 20 with turnip, and a few with 
lint. The only manure made ufe of, befules the dung produ ■ 
ced by the cattle on the different farms, is lime, there bcin-- 
no marie. Some trials of fleech from the fliore, have been 
made, but it did not feem to anfwer. From an acre of barley, 
there is generally reaped, about 40 Winchefter bufhels, of 
oats 36, of wheat 30, of beans 20, of peas 15, of po- 
tatoes 6 tun. There are about rco acres fown with artifi- 
cial graflcs, chiefly clover and rye grafs. About 790 acres in 
pafture, and 1000 acres of common, fome part of which, 
however, is improved every year ; fo that, foo.n, there will be 
no wafte land in the parifh, excepting about 103 acres of mofs, 
which mud be referved for fuel. The expence of peat, in- 
cluding calling, carrying out, winning and leading t4iem 
home, may be about 9d. per cart-load. Such of the inhabi- 
tants as are in better circumftances, ufually purchafe, every 
feafon, fome coals from Cumberland •, for which, they pay at 
the rate of is. 6d. per fingle cart load, befides a journey, go- 
ing and coming of 36 miles, ir addition to the great inconve- 
nience, and rifk of croffing the firth at low water. Some En- 
glifh coal is brought by water, which, with the duty, colls a- 
bout 9s. per ton. while, in Cumberland, at the diftance only of 
two miles, they have the fame coal, for about 3s. per ton. It has

Climate, Charatlcr rf the Petfk, CSV. — Though the foil is ra- 
ther damp in winter, and the air moid and chilly, yet this di- 
ftridt Is rather healthful than otherwife. There are fevcral 
inltances of longevity. Some pcrfons above 3o years of age, now 
Hving,areab'e to go about theirordinary occupations, and even, 
fome about qo and above it. There is one man 93, and a very 
refpectable old woman, 96, who is ft LI 1 remarkably chearfuland 
amazingly recollc&amp;cd. Another old woman died about a month 

ago, that was 93 or 94 On feveral monuments in our 

church-yard, there are inferiptions, aflerting the deceafed to 
have been upwards of 100 years of age, one or two in parti- 
cular, faid to have been 104, if not more The inha- 
bitants are in general above the middle fize, of clear co n- 
plexion, agile, and active, and not deficient in mental qualifi- 
cations : Several of them are above 6 feet high, fome about 6 
feet, 3 inches. They are inclined to be induftrious; but have no 
manufactory of any confcqucncc to employ them. It is thought 
by fome, that the fifhipg hurts their induftry, both in the ma- 
nufacturing and farming line-. The people are not very fond

to fea. Such young men as enter into the army, feem to give 
the preference to the artillery. 

Village, C5V. — Dornock is the only place that can be called 
a village. It is pleaf.intly fituated upon a gentle eminence a- 
bout a mile from the fea, and has a very commanding view of 
the Sclway firth, &amp;c. It confitts of about 25 or 26 dwelling 
houfes, fcattered along the fide of the military road, which 
runs through it. But the manfe, and two other dwelling-hou- 
fes, inhabited by the proprietors, are the only ones two ftory 
high, or covered frith flate. The reft are all mud houfes and 
covered with thatch. 

Mud-honfes. — The farm-houfes in general, and all the cot- 
tages are built of mud or clay ; yet thefe houfes, when plaif- 
tcred and properly finiflied within (as many of them are) 
are exceeding warm and comfortable. The manner of erect- 
ing them is fingular. In the firft place, they dig out the foun- 
dation of the houfe, and lay a row or two of ftones, then they 
procure, from a pit contiguous, as much clay or brick-earth as 
is fufhcient to form the walls : and having provided a quan- 
tity of ftraw, or other litter to mix with the clay, upon 
a day appointed, the whole neighbourhood, male and fe- 
male, to the number of 20 or 30, aifemble, each with a dung- 
fork, a fpade, or fome fuch inftrument. Some fall to the 
working the clay or mud, by mixing it with ftraw ; others car- 
ry the materials ; and 4 or 6 of the moft experienced hands, 
build and take care of the walls. In this manner, the walls 
of the houfe are finiflied in a few hours ; after which, they re- 
tire to a good dinner and plenty of drink which is provided for 
them, where they have mufic and a dance, with which, and 
other marks of feftivity, they conclude the evening. This is 
called a daubing •, and in this manner they make a frolic

of what would otherwife be a very dirty and difagreeable 
job. 

Rent, &amp;c. — The parifh is moftly let in {mail farms, from 
L. 3 : 12s. up to L. 120. per. annum, but the greater part of 
them are under L. 30. The beft arable and meadow grounds, 
let for about 20s. or a guinea per acre, that of an inferior qua- 
lity, at an average, about is. The valued rent of the whole 
parifh, is only 2620 merks Scots. The land rent paid by 
the tenants, is about L. 1480 fterling ; the fifhing rents a- 
bout L. 22©.; and houfe-rents, may be from L. 60. to L. 70 a 
year : total, about L. 1760. None of the greater proprietors, 
who are 6 in number, refide in the parifh. There are 6 feuers 
who have fmall portions of land of their own, who live in the 
village of Dornock. It is certainly unlucky for this diftricl, 
as well as for many others in Scotland, that the property of 
the foil has fallen into the hands of great proprietors, who draw- 
their rents annually away, and fpend them either in London or 
in foreign parts. Whereas fmaller proprietors, living and refid- 
ing on the fpot, would lay out their rents at home, and unit- 
ing their ftock and influence with men of activity in bufmefv, 
in promoting manufactories, commerce, and improvements 
of every kind, would foon prove of efTential fervice both to 
the diftricl itfelf, and to the kingdom in general. 

Roads — The great road from Carlifle to Poripatrick, runs 
through the middle of the parifh. It was made at the expence oi 
government, but is kept in repair by money collected at a toll- 
bar, lately erecled upon it for that purpofe. Some of the crofs- 
roads in this parifh were formerly made, and upheld by the 
flatute labour ; but, in confequence of an act of parliament 
obtained for that purpofe, the ftatute labour is now com- 
muted, and paid in money at the difpofal of the commiffioners 

of

of fupply for the county. Little or none of the money that 
lias been collected for that purpofe, has, however, been 
laid out in this parifli for thefc five years part. 

Antiquities. — From the fituation of the parifh, it is natural 
to fuppofe, that it has frequently been the fcene of action in 
the contefts between the two nations. But the particulars 
of thefe predatory incurfions, are now in a great meafure loft. 
One tradition, however, Iti! I remains, of a battle, faid to have 
been fought upon a muir in the neighbourhood, between a 
party of the EngHfli, commanded by Sir Marmaduke Lang- 
dale and Lord Crofby, and a body of Scots, command- 
ed by Sir "William Brown of Coalfton ; in which the Englifh 
were defeated, and both their commanders flain. They are 
buried in Dornock church-yard. The ftones that are placed 
over them, are about fix feet and a half long, two feet broad 
below, and raifed in the middle like a coffin, but fomewhat 
higher ; and upon the fides of thefe tombs are cut hierogly- 
phics, like broad leaves of plants, and other antique fi- 
gures, quite unintelligible. They feemtobeof confiderable 
antiquity, but have neither letter nor date. A fpring-well on 
the muir where the battle was fought, ft ill bears the name of 
fhe fword-well, probably from fome of thefe weapons being 
found there after the battle. 

There is the remains of a druidical temple, ftill to be fcen 
near Woodhcad, though fome of the ftones, of late, have been 
carried away. — And there is alfo an entrenchment, near Dor- 
nock wood, where about an acre of ground has been furround- 
cd with a fofTee, of confiderable depth, called the fhankj 
but for what purpofe it has been made, is not certainly known. 
The fofTee is now drained and moftly filled up. There is al- 
fo at Stableton (now belonging to the Marquis of Annandale) 
a ftrong fquare tower, built, of hewn {tone, vaulted below,

Englilh borderers The ftone in which a wooden crofs for- 
merly ftood, alfo, {till remains : It was called St. Marjory's 
crofs, to whom, tradition fays, the church itfelf was dedicated. 
The names of places feem moltly derived from the An- 
glo-Saxon, or old Englifh, as Butterdale, Todholes, &amp;c. 
and fome may be derived from the Erfe, as Robgill, Gillfoot 

&amp;c The language, fpoken here is the Englifh, or lowland 

Scots ; but from the intercourfe with Cumberland, a little of 
that dialect, is naturally imbibed. , 

Population. — The population of this parifh is rather on the 
decline, owing, perhaps, to the increafing manufactures in 
our neighbourhood, particularly Carlifle and Annan, which 
has induced fome of the people, to go and fettle there ; and 
partly to the accumulation of many pofleilions into one ; feve- 
ral inftances of which have lately happened. Some young 
people alfo go into England, as fervants, for higher wages, 
and fome as itinerant merchants or pedlars. By the exami- 
nation roll taken about fix or feven years ago, this parifh con- 
tained 780 inhabitants ; and about eight or ten years before 
that, nearly the fame number ; but by the roll taken in March, 
1790, there were only 738 then living, fo that the decreafe a- 
mounts to 42. The number, however, in 1755, acording to 
DrWebfter, was only 716.

The average of baptifms for the laft 5 years is 15, of mar-

is fmall and inconvenient. 

There is a fchool-houfe, and a very good fchoolmafter. His 
falary is only 100 merks Scots, paid by the heritors ; which, 
with the fchool-wages, may amount to L. 18 or L. 20 a year: 
a poor pittance to live on, for any man of education and parts, 
which even a country fchool-mafter ought to be. The num- 
ber of fcholars, fummer and winter,may,on an average, befrom 
50 or da. They are taught reading Englifh, writing, arith- 
metic, geometry, accounts, and a few even Latin. 

The number of poor at prefent upon the lift, are 18. There 
are no funds for their maintenance, but the funday collections, 
which, will fcarcely amount to 3s. a week, together with the 
fmall fum of 10s. yearly, left them by an heritor. 

Agriculture, &amp;c. — There are 60 ploughs in the parifh, 65 
carts, and 48 wheel-cars, or tumbrils. The ploughs are all of the 
Englifh make, with the curved mouldboard, and drawn by two 
horles without any driver. 

The parifh is partly inclofed with hedges and ditches, and 
partly with earth and ftone dikes. The farmers, in gene- 
ral, are very fenfible of the benefit of inclofures, but are not 
always inclined to take proper care of their hedges after they 
are planted. More provifions are raifed in the diftrift than is 
equal to its confumption. The anilual exports may be nearly

Advantages and Dij "advantages. — The advantages of this 
parifh are, its fituation on the Solway firth, and its ready ac- 
cefs to the Englifh and other markets by water carriage. The 
military road between Carlifle and Portpatrick alfo, runs 
through it, and the mails pafs and repafs every day; fo that the 
communication by land to any part of the three kingdoms is 
eafy and expeditious. 

On the oppofite fcale, the following circumftances may be 
placed, towit, the moiftnefs of the climate •, the violent gufts of 
wind from the weft and fouth weft, even in the fummer fea- 
fon, by which the crops, particularly thofe of the tender kind,

are greatly injured ; the great fcarcity of timber ; the want of 
water-falls to drive machinery; and, above all, the fatal duty upon 
coals ; to which, may be added, the want of perfons of capi- 
tal and fpirit to provide employment for the poor, who fuffer 
- much from neglect, no provifion being made for their fuppovt, 
while the rents they raife.are fpent by their landlords in diftant 
parts of the kingdom. 

Character of the People- — The people in this parifh are natu- 
rally fober, aclive, and indultrious. They are greatly more ci- 
vilized than they were 20 or 30 years ago, particularly fince all 
intercourfe of a contraband nature with the Ille of Man has been 
broken off. They are in general, contented with their fituation, 
though defirous of improving it ; and fo ftri£t in their conduct 
and behaviour, that, not only during the incumbency of ths 
prefent minifter, but from time immemorial, not one indivi- 
dual among them has been convicted of a capital crime.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20713711">KIRKMAHOE</name>. 

(COUNTY OF DUMFRIES.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Lawson.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, CSV. 
'THHIS parifh is fituated in the (hire, prefbytery, and fynod 
of Dumfries. Any origin that can be affigned for the 
name is merely conjectural *. Its form is not eafily defcrib- 
ed, its length and breadth being fo various. It is furrounded 
by the parifhes of Clofeburn, Kirkmichael, Tinwald, Dum- 
fries, Holywood, and Dunfcore. The northern and eaftern 

parts are hilly, but there are no mountains of any note. Where 
this pariih joins Tinwald, there are many little rifing grounds 
snterfperfed with rnoraffy grounds at the bottom, which, when 
out of tillage, are foon covered with furze and broom ; but, 
when plowed (as they are of a light kindly foil) they produce 
pretty good crops of oats. Some of them were never plowed 
till within theie few years pad. The more hilly parts of the 
parifh produce heath and coarfe grafs, fit only for fheep. 
There are two confiderable fheep farms in thefe hills, one of 

which

which maintains about fixty, and the other from twenty to thir- 
ty fcore. The wool is faid to be uncommonly good, and ufu- 

ally fells at the beft price of any in the neighbourhood. The 

other high grounds, alfo, feed a confiderable number of flieepj 
but being in many hands, the number cannot be fo well af- 
certained. They probably, however, amount to, at leaft, twen- 
ty fcore more. 

Progrefs of Improvement. — When the prefent incumbent 
was ordained, An. 1750, improvements were not commenced. 
There was not a cart in the parifti but two ; and thefe were 
merely for the purpofe of fupplying the families to whom they 
belonged, with water for domeftic ufes. About that time the 
eftate of Carnfalloch was purchafed by the late Mr Johnfton. 
He was the firft, in this part of the country, who made any 
confiderable exertion in draining, inclofing, and planting , 
Which foon altered the afped~t, and increafed the value of his 
eftate. By his means, in a great meafure, the ufe of carts 
was introduced ; the number of which, increafed fo rapidly, 
that, in a ftiort time, even the pooreft tenants were provided 

with one, and many with two or more The neighbouring 

gentlemen foon followed Mr Johnfton's example. Great im- 
provements were made both in the low lands, and on the ri* 
fing grounds ; and thus the parifti, inftead of being almoft in 
a ftate of nature, or, at leaft, comparatively unprodu&amp;ive, 
became remarkable for its cultivation. Planting alfo, became 
an obje£t of attention, and there are feveral hundred acres 
covered with different forts of trees, which greatly adds to the 
beauty of the country. 

Hujbandry.-— Some years ago, it was a rare thing to fee 
fewer than four horfes in a plough. Three in a yoke, was a 
matter of wonder. But, for a great while paft, two horfes,

generally fpeaking, do the fame work with equal facility* 
This, however, is greatly owing co the breed being improved. 

Dalfwinton. — The eftate of Dalfwinton is by far the largeft 
in the parifh. It was there where the Comings in former 
times had one of their chief feats. It was a large Gothic build- 
ing, reared on one of the higheft eminences in the neighbour- 
hood. In 1750, and for fome time after, large portions of 
the old walls were (landing ; and, from thefe ruins it appear- 
ed to have been a large fabric, and of confiderable ftrength. 
Thefe (tones were afterwards ufed for building a manfion- 
houfe and offices, immediately below the eminence. The 
mount where the caftle flood, and the grounds adjacent were 
planted with fir and other trees to a confiderable extent. A 
large orchard alfo was made, which, for many ye.ars, yielded a 
lent of 50 guineas per annum. "Within thefe few years this 
eftate was purchafed by Patrick Miller, Efq. who has already 
with tnfte and much judgement, and with wonderful rapidity, 
improved great part of the eftate, and has made Dalfwinton 
one of the fineft feats in the fouth of Scotland. He is in a like- 
ly way of pre venting the river Nith from making fuch depredations 
upon the rich holm lands, as it had formerly done ; and is ef- 
fecting many other alterations and improvements of equal im- 
portance. He has now built, on the mount where the old caf- 
tle ftood (and as near to the old foundation as was confiftent 
with the fafety of the building) one of the belt and moft com- 
modious dwelling houfes, for its dimenfions, of any in this 
part of the kingdom. From its top, there is one of the 
moft extenfive and plealing profpects any where to be met 
with. 

Pcp-Jation. — The inhabitants cf the parifh amount to about 
1200. In 1755, according to Dr Webfter, the number was 

1098. 



of Kir%maboe. 



1398. Baptifms for fome years part, have been upwards of 
4a. Marriages about fix, feven, or eight, and feldom more- 
Deaths, much in the fame proportion, as in the neighbouring 
parifhes, according to the number of inhabitants. For up- 
wards of 40 years back, there has been no epidemical difeafe, 
but the fmall-pox ; excepting a fever, which, about 30 years 
ago, raged for fome time ; and got, from the village where 
it hrft appeared, the name of the Duncow fever. But only a 
few were cut off by it. 

Villages. — Befides a new and regularly built village on the 
cflate of Dalfwinton, for the accommodation of 15 families, 
and upwards, there are four others; the fmalleft of which 
contains about 100 inhabitants, and the largeft (Duncow) be- 
tween 150 and 200. 

Roads and Bridges. — There are, perhaps, few public roads 
kept in better repair, than thofe in this neighbourhood. By 
the furplus of the parifh funds, alfo, fome excellent crofs-roads, 
little, if at all inferior to the principal ones, have been late- 
ly made. Befides three bridges upon the principal high-road, 
two of them over pretty rapid rivulets, there are four others in 
the parifh, well executed, and of the greateft benefit to the in- 
habitants. 

Man/e, Stipend, and Glebe. — The manfe is one of the old- 
eft in this part of the country. It was built about-i 723, but 
has had partial repairs at different times fince. The church, 
which is an old one, has been for fome time in a good condi- 
tion. The ftipend amounts to L. 83 : 6 : 8, communion ele- 
ments included. But as a part of it is paid in victual, it has 
produced for fome years rather more. The glebe is fmall : what 

Vol. H. E is

is properly glebe indeed, not exceeding four acres; but the gra# 
and arable land united, may be from feven to eight acres. 

Heritors. — There are four heritors who have confiderablc 
eftates in the parifli. Of the reft, to the number of four- 
teen, the greater part of them have only fmall properties ; 
and are commonly diftinguiflied by the name of portioners. 
They have of late got their lands, which formerly lay in run- 
rigg, divided and fet apart, which has occafioned very great 
improvements. 

HJ 

Rcrf. —The valuation of the parilh is 7 234 J merks Scots- 
The real rent cannot eafdy be afcertained. It probably a- 
tnounts to about L. 3000. fterling. As lands are rifing r 
and as there is a very great track of fine holm, and other, 
ground of an excellent quality, and ft ill capable of much im- 
provement, it is not eafy to conje£ture to what fum the rental 
may foon rife. Some land now lets at from L. 1 : 10s to L. 2. 
per acre. Every fort of grain produced in the neighbourhood, 
alfo potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. are raifed to very great perfec- 
tion* 

Poor. — The poor, who, for 40 or 50 years back, have been 
about 20 in number, have always been maintained by the 
public collections in the church, together with fome dues on 
particular occafions, and the intereft of fome mortified mo- 
ney* In this way, by distributions four times annually, and 
fome fmall donations occafionally given amongft them, there 
have never been any complaints.. Some of the poor, too, are 
pretty induftrious, and endeavour, in a great meafure, to main- 
tain themfelves ; by which means, more can be given to others* 
who are old or infirm, and unable to do any thing. 



School', 



of Kirkmahoe. 35 

Schools.— There is one legal fchool and fchoolmafter in the 
parifh. His falary, together with fome mortified money, 
amounts to L. 8 : 7 : 8 ; and by the common fchool wages for 
teaching, his income may rife to more than double that fum. 
There are other fchools in fome of the villages ; one in particu- 
lar, on the eftate of Dalfwinton, to the fupport of which Mr. 
Miller generoufly contributes- There are few or none in the 
parifli, any way advanced in life, who are not capable of 
reading Englifh, and in genera!, who have not learned a lit- 
tle writing and arithmetic. 

Ale-houfes. — Within thefe few years the number of alc-hou- 
fes has greatly diminilhed. By the additional taxes upon malt, 
and the more rigid exactions of excife-men, people do not 
find it worth their while to fell ale : There were at any n,te, 
but few in the parifh. Of late, felling whifky and other fpi- 
rits, has chiefly prevailed. This muft, at times, produce the 
common effects attending the ufe of fpirituous liquors. The 
jpeople, however, are in general fober and induitrious.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">LOCHRUTTON 1</name>, 

(STEWARTRY OF KIRKCUDBRIGHT.) 

JBy the Rev. Mr. George Duncan,</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name, Situation, and Extent. 
T OCHRUTTON derives its name from a lake or loeh in 
the centre of the parifh. The meaning of loch is well 
known, and the word rutton is fuppofed to fignify, in the Gae- 
lic language, the Jlraight road. As the great road to Ireland, 
through the ftewartry and the county of Galloway, paffes clofe 
by the loch, it feems to have received the name of Lochrutton, 
or the loch upon the Jlraight road, from that circumftance. 
The name was afterwards transferred to the whole diftricl: in 
the neighbourhood. The parifh is fituated in the county or 
ftewartry of Kirkcudbright, and is one of the ten pariihes be- 
longing to that ftewartry, which is incorporated with thepref- 
bytery and fynod of Dumfries. It is of an eliptical form and 
maybe computed to be four miles and a half long, from eaft to 
weft, and three miles broad from north to fouth. It is bound- 
ed by the parifhes of Newabbey and Troouire on the fouth 
and eaft, Terregles and Irongray on the north, and Urr and 
Kirkgunzeon on the weft. 



Surface 



of Lochrutton, 37 

Surface, Soil, and Climate, — From the town of Dumfries, 
which is diftant about four miles to the eaftward, the country 
riles gradually, more efpecially throughout the whole extent 
of this diftrid. In the lower and upper extremities, and to- 
wards the fouth, the country is hilly ; but the reft of the pa- 
rifn lies in a valley confiiting of arable land, interfperfed with 
knolls, mofles, and meadows. The whole profpecT: forms a 
kind of amphitheatre. The foil is various, but, in general, is 
compofed of light (hallow loam, either on white granite, or on 
a gravellifh, and in many places a cold, fpringy bottom : a fpe- 
cies of foil, which is neither very barren, nor very fertile. The 
climate is rather colder in this diftrid, than in fome of the 
neighbouring parifhes, being much elevated above the level of 
the fea, and having in it a large lake. But as refrefliing 
breezes are fcldom wanting, even in the hotteit weather ; and 
ii.s, at other times, there are frequently (harp and high winds, 
the air is greatly purified by thefe means ; and, on the whole, 
it is accounted healthy. 

Lake, IJIaiul, vSV. — The lake or loch, from which the pa- 
rifh derives its name, is a mile in length, and, at an average, 
about half a mile in breadth. In the middle of it, there is a 
fmall ifland, about half a rood in extent, of a circular form- 
It feems to have been, at lead in part, artificial: Over its 
whole furface, there is a collection of large Hones which have 
been founded on a frame of oak planks *. There are both pike 
and perch in the lake ; and formerly eels were caught, in great 
quantities, by means of wicker bafk=ts, and fometimes of a 
large cheft placed in the fiuice, at the foot of the lake, witho- 

penings 

* The fea-gulls frequent this ifland in funanier, and cover it aH 
over with their nefts. 



38 Statijlical Account 

penings at the bottom, which let the water pafs, but retained 
the fifli. The fifhing, however, now turns to very little ac- 
count. From the lake there iffues a fmall ftream, in which 
tfoutsare found. 

Mineral Spring. — There is a mineral fpring in the parifli, 
called Merkland well, of the chalybeate kind : a very effe&amp;ual 
remedy in agues, complaints of the ftomach, and all nervous 
diforders ; but fatal in confumption6. It is exceedingly light, 
very diuretic, and an excellent reftorer of the appetite. Though 
the accommodation has been always very indifferent, yetv. this 
water was formerly refortcd to, during the fummer months, 
by perfons of rank and fortune, as well as by numbers of infe- 
rior note. Of late years, its reputation, among people of fu- 
perior ftation, has rather declined •, partly, becaufe there is a 
whim and fafhion with refpect to what are called, watering 
places ; and, becaufe, though the accommodation is much im- 
proved, this improvement has by no means kept pace with the 
luxury of the times. 

Minerals.— Lime-ftone has been found upon upon the eftates 
of Mr Conftable of Nithfdale, and Mr Irvine of Gribton. 
A quantity of the foffil was lately obtained for a trial, but when 
fire was applied, inftead of being reduced to a calx, it cemen- 
ted. This may difcourage farther attempts, efpecially as it 
muft be difficult or expenfive, while the duty on coals conti-r 
nues, to procure, in this part of the country, a fufficient quanr 
tity of fuel to carry on the procefs. 

Antiquities. — The veitige of a druidical temple is to be feen 
upon a hill at the eaftern extremity of the parifh. This fpot 
goes by ;he name of ^he/even grey Jlones ; though in fac"i there 
are nine ftones ; furrounding a rifing ground, and forming a 

circle

circle of about 170 feet diameter. This place was excellently 
fituated for aftronomical obfervations, commands a fine open- 
ing to the eaft, and one of the richeft and molt extenfive pro- 

fpedls in this part of the country. There are veftiges alio, 

of feveral of thofe towers ufed antiently, both as places of re- 
fidence and of defence, in times of hoftility ; fome of which 
appear to have been furrounded with a foflee. One tower 
remains yet entire, and is mentioned in a Scots chronicle, 
publifhed in the reign of James VI. by the name of the Caflle 
of Hills. The are abefore the entrance is inclofed, and, over 
the gate, a porter's lodge was erected. When this tower was 
built is uncertain ; but, upon a corner ftone of the lodge, 
which feems to be of a more modern conftruclion, the year 
1598 is infcribed. 

Population. — The population has not materially varied for 
fixty years part. In 1728, the fartheft period to which it can 
now be traced, the number of fouls were 480. In 1755, ac- 
cording to Dr Webfter, 564. 

In 1790, as follows.

ProduBionS) crops, £sV. — The parifh not only fuppHes itfclf 
with provifions, but, there is exported to England, ordifpofed of 
elfewhere, a number of young cattle, and a confiderable quan- 
tity of barley. Upon thefe articles, the farmers principally 
depend for the payment of their rents. A great proportion of 
oats, too, when made into meal, is fold in Dumfries market, 
andbought up tofupply the miners atLeadhillsandWanlockhead, 

or tranfported to the weft country Oat-feed, if the feafon 

anfwers, is begun to be fown on the fecond or third week of 
March, barley towards the end of April, and turnip towards 
the middle of June. Wheat has been tried, but not with much 
iuccefs. Early fowing, is looked upon a3 of confiderable ad- 
vantage ; the harveft being in general late, and indeed often 
later by three weeks, than many places in the neighbour- 
hood. 

Shell Marie — Within thefe fifty years, fhell marie has been 
difcovered ; and has operated as a very confiderable fource of 
improvement. Before that fortunate difcovery, the fpecies of 

Vol. II. F oats,

Stahjlicnl Account 



oats, commonly cultivated, was of the grey kind ; but, in s 
few years after, it entirely difappeared, and gave place to the 
white oats. The marie is far from being yet exhaulled, and 
where it begins to fail, lime is fubflituted in its place. In- 
deed, marie was obfervcd'to produce fuch wonderful effects, 
that thofe farmers, who had not accel's to it, were foon indu- 
ced to have recourfe to lime, imported from England, and to 
carry it even ten or twelve miles by land carriage. It has been 
obferved, that, whenever the land has been once enriched 
with lime or marie, and afterwards laid down into pafture, 
that the ground, early in the fpring, is covered with daifies, 
which are fucceeded, in the beginning of fummer, with 
plentiful crop of white clover. 

Fuel. — The fiiel commonly made ufe of is peat. There are 
feveral moffes, from which, the farmers are allowed the privi- 
lege of taking what they require. Some of thefe contain 
marie, under 3 or 4 feet of mofs. There is one large mofs, 
which not only furnifhes fuel to the families refiding upon 
the eftates of the gentleman, whofe property it is, but to o- 
thers in the parifh and neighbourhood. Some is fold at the 
rate of 2s. each cart-load ; but this by way of favour or conni- 
vance. 

Heritors and Rent. — The heritors, or owners of land in 
the parifli, are foven in number. One of them, proprietor 
only of a fmall eftate, refides in it. 

The land rent of the parifh, twenty years ago, was L. 900. 
it is now, L. 1540. To give an idea of the rile of rents, it 
is faid, that three farms, which together yield, at prefent, 
L. 100 per annu7n i 'wzxt poffeffed, towards the end of laft century, 
Upon condition of paying the public burden? upon the eftate 

of 



of Lochrutton. - 43 

of Nithfdale, in the parifh, which could not, at that time, 
exceed L. 12. fterling. The beft arable land, may be valu- 
ed at 1 ;s per acre, the inferior at 6s or 7s. But, as there is 
fcarce a farm, that has not a great proportion of barren land, 
this can give no idea of the rent per acre. Some farms are 
rented from L. 60. to L. 100. others as low as from L. 10. to 
L. 20. but the general run is about L. 40. The farms are di- 
vided from one another, by march dykes, but few of them 
fo fubdivided as to encourage a proper plan of improve- 
ment. 

Church, Patron, Poor, — The church was built in the 
times of Popery ; it was hut repaired in 1786. The manfe was 
built in 1 730 ; and repaired in 1777. The value of the living, 

including the glebe, is eflimated at L. 90. The patron 

is the Duke of Queenfberry. The annual amount of the 

funds for the relief of the poor, is per annum, about L. 20, 
out of which, eight perfons receive a quarterly allowance. 
Others receive alms occafionally. None of the poor beg from 
door to door ; but fcarcely a day paffes, that the parifh is not 
vifited with vagrant poor, from neighbouring parifhes, or 
from Ireland. In 1782 and 1783, when there was a ge- 
neral fcarcity over the country, the crops in this diftri£r. 
were, at leaft, as good as ufual-, and though the harveft 
was late, the crops were got fafely in. The farmers were fo 
grateful for the plenty they enjoyed, and were fo fenfible of 
the hardfhips a number of families might fuffer from the high 
price of provifions, that they ftored up a confiderable quanti- 
ty of oat-meal, to be fold to fuch of their neighbours as ftood 
in need of a fupply, at is. 8d. per ftone, though at that time 
the market price was 2s. 4d. 



Roads.

Statiftical Account 



Roads. — The great military road to Portpatriek, runs 
through the whole length of this parifh. 

Crofts-roads are alfo making, by the ftatute labour now 
commuted, though they have not in general been brought in- 
to proper order. 

Advantages and Difad vantages The ricli beds of marie, 

difperfed over this diftrict, are the moft material advantages 
it enjoys over fome other places in the neighbourhood •, but 
this is counterbalanced by many disadvantages, in particular, 
the extraordinary expence of cultivation ; the fields being flony, 
interfperfedwith knolls, and molt of them lyingonanafcent.The 
climate, and comparative poverty of the foil, alfo retard'the pro- 
grefs of vegetation; fo thatgrafs and hay are by no means luxu- 
riant, and the crops of oats, b;:rley, &amp;c. are of an inferior 
quality ; and, in an unfavourable feafon, when the harveft is 
late, expofed to wind, rain, ana frofL 

Means of farther Improvements. — The inhabitants may be 
faid to enjoy, in a reafonable degree, the comforts and ad- 
vantages of fociety : there are means, however, by which 
their condition might be improved. The coldnefs of the 
climate, and the latenefs of the harveft, have been mention- 
ed as peculiarly difadvantageous. Thefe difadvantages might, 
in a great meafure, be remedied, by planting, draining, and 
raifing ftone and thorn hedges. Were the proprietors to 
turn their attention to thefe objects, and to purfue them 
with fpirit and perfeverance, the climate itfclf would be 
changed, cultivation would rapidly advance-, and, whilil 
they enjoyed the heart felt-fatisfaition cf augmenting the 
happinefs of their fellow creatures', their exertions would 
be amply rewarded, by an incrgafe in the value of their e-

ftates. If fuch a plan were adopted, one may renture 
to affirm, that, this part of the country, which, at prefent, 
has a bare and bleak appearance, would become, in the 
courfe of fifteen or twenty years, diftinguiflied for warmth, 
(belter, and fertility.

from every other parifh, except Lefwalt, which forms its 
boundary to the fouth. On all other fides, it is furrounded 
by the fea. It is, on an average, about four miles in breadth, 
and it extends in length, along the weft fhore of Lochryan, 
from five to fix miles. On this coaft, partly formed by the 
fhores of Kirkcolm, is a beautiful bafon, called the Wig, 
large enough to afford a fafe retreat for a great number of 
fmall craft in bad weather ; and in other parts of the bay of 
Lochryan, there is a fufiicient depth of "water for fhips of any 
burden, and either good anchoring grounds, or a foft beach, as 
:nay be moft convenient : And, as there are no fhoals or funken 
rocks near the mouth, to obftruiSV. the entrance, itisqueftionable, 
whether a more convenient harbour is to be found between 
the two head-lands or MulU of Kintyre. and Galloway. 




— — Beyond 



of iCirkcolm. 47 

Beyond a final] point of land, called the Star, there is 
a fine bank of moft excellent oyfters, fmall indeed, but highly 
flavoured, and of a moft delicious tafte. It is belieted, that 
if perfons, fkilled in managing dredge-nets, were to ply in 
deep water, oyfters would be got in greater numbers, and of 
a larger fize, than by the prefent mode of taking them off the 
beach, with the hand, when the tide is out and, inftead of 
being (tinted to a day or two about the new or the full moon, 

they might dredge for them at all times with fuccefs. 

In regard to frefh waters, in fo narrow a peninfula, any large 
ftream cannot be expe£ted ; and accordingly there is but 
one fmall rivulet, which very fcantily fupplies water fuf- 
ficient to ferve a corn miln, the only one in the parifh. 

Surface, Crops, £sV. — The furface of the parifh is rather plain 
and level, than hilly, and, the rifing grounds havefo eafyandgen- 
tle an afcent, that they may be, and actually are, cultivated 
with the plow even to the very fummit. The foil is variocs r 
Round the fhore it is thin, fandy, or gravellifh •, in the more 
inland parts, it is infome place? a rich loam, in others a deep 
clay -, and in others, a mixture all thefe foils. 

The crops principally raifed are oats and barley, or bear, 
with rye grafs and clover. They have not yet engaged in the 
culture of field turnips or cabbages. Small quantities of grey 
peafe, and fmaller quantities of horfe beans are fown by fome 
for their own private ufe, but none for fale ; and much the 
fame may be faid in regard to wheat. The fpirit of improv- 
ing land began fome years ago ; but it was confined to a few 
individuals, proprietors of the land they cultivated. The 
common tenants thought fuch operations were too expenfive 
for them to embark in ; but now that fpirit has diffufed itfelf 
greatly, and, indeed, almoft univerfally, among farmers of 
ail defcriptions. 

Manure 



Statijlical Account 



Matwresy bfc. — The manure chiefly made ufe of is lime % 
great quantities of which are imported from Whitehaven, in 
the north of England, and ftill greater from Loch-Lame, in 
the north of Ireland. Confiderable quantities of {hells, which 
are found not far from the furface, in feveral places of the 
parifh, are alfo ufed. Another manure, much run upon at pre- 
fent, is a foft fea fand, either taken from within the flood- 
mark, or dug in lands that have been formerly covered by the 
fea. This laft manure is not thought to be fo ftrong in qua- 
lity as the former, but by fpreading it a little thicker, it is 
found to anfwer equally well •, and is in great requeft, as it 
cofts nothing, but the labour of bringing and laying it on. 
It has not yet been afcertained how long the virtue and effica- 
cy of this manure will continue ; but feveral have found the 
good effects of it for four, five, fix, and feven years ; and 
when the fource whence.it is taken is confidered, we may ven- 
ture to pronounce it an incxhauftible fund of wealth to the 
diflria. 

The quantity of grain produced by means of thefe manures, 
is very confiderable, and increafing every year. About twen- 
ty years ago, it was thought a very extraordinary crop, if about 
200 bolls of bear and oats, after referving what was fufficierrt 
for the maintenance of the inhabitants, could be exported. 
But within thefe ten or twelve years paft, the export has rifen 
from 200, to 400, to 600, to 800, to iopo, and in 1790, to 1200 
Galloway bolls, each boll, containing twelve bufhels, Win- 
chefter meafure. Nay ? it is believed, by the molt judicious 
and intelligent farmers, that the quantity exported will go on 
increafing for many years to come. The grain is carried to 
Ayr, Greenock, Glafgow, and other places on the Clyde. 
Thefe improvements in hufbandry have alfo mended the 
breed of cattle, the farmer being enabled by the greater quan- 
tity, and the better quality of food to rear them in greater

numbers, to raife them to a larger fize, and to greater per- 
fection.

Rents, Stipend, Poor, 6«rV. — The rents of the parifh exceed 



L. 3000 per annum, which is more than double the amount 
feven years ago. There are only five proprietors ; of whom the 
Earl of Galloway, who is alfo patron of the church, and titu- 
lar of the tiends, is by far the moft confiderable. The fti- 
pend has not been augmented for more than fixty years ; and 
amounts to four bolls of bear, twelve bolls of meal, Wigton 
meafure, L. 53 in money, and a glebe of about nine acres. 

The poor are chiefly fupported by the collections at 

the church doors, which produce about L. I o per annum. 
With this fmall fum, and the occasional charity of the 
well-difpofed part of the inhabitants, the poor, to the num- 
ber of fixteen, are not only preferved from ftarving, but 
are, in a great meafure, prevented from ftraggling to beg 
in other parifhes in the neighbourhood. 

Till within thefe three years, there was not the leaft vef- 
tige of a village in the parifh ; but, fince that time, about 
thirty houfes, contiguous to each other, have been built. 
They are, in general, inhabited by tradefmen, but fome of

them by common day-lrbourers. Unfortunately, however, 
more than one third of thefe houfes may be called gin, or 
rather whiflcy (hops, as they all fell that pernicious liquor. What 
effects this muft have upon the morals of die people, net 
only in the village, but in the neighbourhood, may be e fiiy 
forefeen. 

Air and Climate, — The climate is mild and temperate, 
and the air falubrious. Many of the inhabitants live to a 
very confiderable age. The minifters of Kirkcolm have, 
in particular, been diftinguifhed by longevity. In 1643, 
Mr James Bell was fettled minifter, and held the cure, 
with fome interruption when Epifcopacy was eftabliihed 
in Scotland, until the year 1 700. His fucceflbr, Mr. Mar- 
shall, pofTeffed the charge until 1705, when the prefent in- 
cumbent was admitted ; who, in April 1791, was on the verge 
of eighty. 

There are no mineral or medicinal wells in this parilh ; 
and the holy wells, that, in times of ignorance, were fuc'n 
objects of fuperftitious veneration, are now treated with con- 
tempt and ridicule. 

Antiquities. — This parifh furnilhes no antiquities, but 
the ruins of &amp;n old building, which has been .large and 
capacious. Tradition has not fo much as preferveu the 
name cf the founder or its inhabitants. It is only certain, that 

it has not been habitable for above a century. It may be 

proper to add, that, in digging among the ruins feme months 
ago, a fmall cannon was found, feven feet long, and about 
three inches in the bore. This circumftance tends to prove, 
in addition to the thicknefs of die walls, that it was built 
as a place of ftrenrth for the protection of the neighbouring 
country. </p>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7619443">STONYKIRK</name>. 
(county of wigton.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Henry Blain.</head> 

<p>Name, Situation, Extent, &amp;c. 
'HE parilh of Stonykirk, more properly StephenUrk, 



compofed of the united parifhes of Stonykirk, Clafhank, 
and Tofcarton, in Stranraer prefbytery, lies in the county of 
Wigton ; and is bounded by the bay of Luce on the eafl, Kirk- 
maiden parifh on the fouth, the Irifh channel and Portpatrick 
parifh on the weft, and by the parifhes of Inch and Glenluce oh 
the north. It contains about 17,000 acres; of which, 700, 
lying along the bay of Luce, are of a fandy foil, hardly capa- 
ble of improvement. The foil of the reft of the parilh is, in 
general, light and dry ; and favourable to an early har- 
veft. 

Pr oprietor! and Rent. — In the parilh there are five heritors ; 
the two moft confiderable of whom refide in it. The valued 
rent is L. 4924 Scots ; the real rent, fervices, &amp;c. included, 
is eftimated at L. 3169 : 2 ; 7 fterling; but a confiderable rile 
may foon be expecled. 




Manure. 



5? Stqti/lica! Account 

Manure. — There has been, for fome years part, a vaft quan* 
tity of lime, for manure, imported from Whitehaven ; and 
delivered to the farmers, at is. 2d. the Carlifle bufhel, or her- 
ring barrel. A fouth eaft wind brings plenty of fea-weed to 
Balgreggan head, in the bay of Luce, which is conftantly ap- 
plied as manure ; and is found to yield one luxuriant crop, if 
put on wet clay land, particularly if the following fummer is 
dry and warm. In confequence of the great alteration 
made by thefe articles, the value of land has increafed confi- 
derably. The tenants find their account in improving, and pay 
their advanced rents with greater facility than before ; fo that, 
Galloway, (as thefe improvements are now becoming general) 
may, with great propriety, be called a corn country. 

Produce, Exports, &amp;c — More grain is exported from Sto-» 
nykirk, than from any pariih in the weft of Galloway. It is 
computed, that, after fupplying the inhabitants, the ex- 
port amounts to 1800 bolls of oats, 900 bolls of bear, and a- 
bout 100 tons of potatoes, per annum. There is more flax 
raifed here than in any other pariih in the neighbourhood. 
That crop has been particularly attended to fmce the com- 
mencement of the late American war. About L. 2000, on an 
average, is annually received for black cattle. For fome 
years pad, it has been the practice to rear a number of fwine, 
which were fold for flaughter ; but it is now found to anfwer 
better to kill them at home, and to fend the carcafes to the 
London market. That article brought about L. 200. in 1790. 
Ali the fheep, reared in the pariih, are confumed in it. The 
mutton of fuch as feed on the fea coaft, is reckoned remarkably 
high-flavoured. 



Prices of Prcvijiin and Labour. — Beef, mutton, and lamb, 
fell at 3d. — and pork at about 2r the pound; — a goofe fells 
2 for

lor is 3d.— and a hen for 8d. or 9c!. each eggs at ad. the do- 
zen-,— rabbits, (of which, there is a good warren on the bay of 
Luce) 5d. the pair -,— butter 8d.— and common cheefe 3d. 
the pound of 24 ounces. The average price of well drcfi'ed 
oats is rather below L. 1. per boll, of 12 Winchefter bufliels ; 
— of common bear, about L. i : I ; — and of two rowed bar- 
ley, generally L. 1 : 6, per ditto. A day labourer, if he finds 
his own victuals, receives is. per day ; — carpenters and ma- 
ions from is 6d. to is iod. Were it not for the influx of the 
lrilh, the price of the labour would have become infuppor- 
tably high. 

Services — There are various fervices performed by the te- 
nants, to the refident heritors, fuch as cutting peats, and car- 
rying them to the manor houfe, cutting down corn, and fome- 
times ploughing and harrowing. Baillie work, as it is term- 
ed, is common over the whole county of Wigton. 

Manufaclures. — Some years ago, fait was manufactured at 
two places in this parifli ; but the practice is now discontinu- 
ed, probably, becaufe it was found ealier to fmuggle that ar- 
ticle from Ireland. This bufmefs, however, might be revived 
with advantage to the public and to the undertakers, particu- 
larly if the fifheries fhould prove fuccefsful. There is fome 
kelp made here every year, and generally exported to Ireland. 
The coarfe yarn fpun by the old women, is ufually brought to 
the fairs, of which two are held every year, in this parifli, 
and there readily bought up to be .nade into ofnaburghs for 
the Weft Indian market. There is in this parifli a bleachfleld, 
and four mills for drefling flax, alfo a very excellent mill for 
making pot or pearl barley, conftrufted by an ingenious me- 
chanic from Edinburgh, with ^ view of preparing that article 
for the Liverpool market.

Fijheries. — Tliere is a tolerable good cod fifhery in the ftifh 
channel, which is purfued with various fuccefs through the 
whole feafon ; but none is exported. About Lammas, abun- 
dance of mackerel are taken in the bay of Luce. The falmon 
fifhery might be carried on with fome fuccefs, but has been 
very much neglected. 

Reals. — The parifh roads, formerly made and repaired, 
by ftatute labour, are new kept in order by a converfion of 
15s. for every L. 10c. Scots, of valued rent, payable by the 
tenants, pro rata ; and each houfeholder, not a tenant, pays 
at the rate is. 8d. per annum. 

Stipend^ Schools, tzfe. — The flipend is L. 640. Scots, in- 
cluding L. 40 for furnifhing communion elements, 60 bolls of 
meal, 32 bolls of bear, Linlithgow meafure, with a manfe and 
glebe. The patronage of the church lies in the Crown, and 
Mr. M'Donald of GarthIand,/«- w^r, the former for Clafhank 
and Tofcarton, and the latter for Stonykirk. There are 
two fchools in the parifh, both in wretched order as to houfes ; 
A.nd the falary only 100 merks. There may be above 130 fcho- 
lars at them, for four months in the year, but after the 1 ft of 
March, the number dwindles down to 20 or thereabouts. There 
are, at prefent, about 1 5 poor on the funds'; the collection for 
their relief, amounts, at an average, only to 7s 6d. per week.

<p>Origin of the Name. 
/^OLMONELL or Calmonell, is prefumed to be of Gaelic 
derivation, as the names of many places in this parifh 
undoubtedly are *. Some, who pretend to knowledge in that 
language, alledge the word fignifies a turtle dove, or wood 
pigeon, with which, there is reafon to believe, the parifli for- 
merly abounded, and (till many of thefe birds harbour in woods 
on the banks of the river Stinchiar. Or, if conjecture might 
take place where no certainty can be obtained, the name may 
be derived from St Coleman, one of the popifh faints. There is 
a parilh in the prefbytery of Kintyre, of nearly the fame name, 
Kilcolmonell ; where, as the Gaelic language is better under- 
ftood, more certain information, as to ihe etymology and fig- 
nification of the name, may perhaps be obtained.

Stailfikal Account 



Situation and Extent. — The parifh is fituated in that diftrift 
of the county of Ayf called Carrick. At the firft fettlement of 
prefbyteries in Scotland, it was propofed, according to Cal- 
derwood's hiftory, to make it the feat of a prefbytery ; but this 
not taking place, it was firft placed in the prefbytery of Ayr, 
and fynod of Glafgow and Ayr ; but was afterwards annexed 
to the prefbytery of Stranraer, and fynod of Galloway, united 
to which it now remains. As Stranraer is very diftant, and 
the prefbytery of Ayr, perhaps, at prefent, too numerous 
a body, the eredlion of a new prefbytery in Carrick, for the 
feat of which Girvan or Dailly would be pretty centrical 
and commodious, has been fuggefted. It was originally of 
uncommon large' extent ; but when the parifh of Barr was e- 
rected, all the lands of Ardmillan, extending three miles along 
the fliore, and about two miles inland, were disjoined from 
Colmonell and annexed to Girvan. A very large parifh, how- 
ever, ftill remains ; its greateft length from weft to eaft, be- 
ing about fourteen computed miles, and its average breadth a- 
bout fix. 

Surface, Soil, and Climate. — The furface varies in different 
parts of the parifh. From the fea, towards the inland parts 
of the country, it is very hilly for about four miles. The reft 
of the parifh, though more elevated above the level of the 
fea, is flat. The foil is in general thin and light, feldom above 
the ordinary depth of a plough furrow, moftly upon a tilly 
bottom, and pretty much encumbered with ftones. The flat 
land, however, upon the fides of the river, is a loamy foil, mix- 
ed with fand of a good depth, and particularly well calculated for 

fruit trees. There are feven gardens, or orchards in the 

parifh, all of whom produce apples, pears, plumbs, cherries, 
and the fmaller fruits in the greateft perfection. — In regard to 
climate, there ate few places in Ayrfhire, or in the fouth weft 

z r " of 



of Colmonell,

of Scotland, where the air is milder or more wholefome than 
in the village of Colmonell, and all along the banks of the Stin- 
chiar. The weary and impatient traveller, chilled and 

benumbed with the pinching cold he has experienced on the 
adjacent mountains, feels with peculiar pleafure, the genial 
warmth of the valley into which he defcends. The inhabi- 
tants, in general, are not only long lived, but healthy in their 
old age. There are a good number upwards of 80, now alive j 
among whom, there is a woman in the 98 year of her age, who 
reaped corn lalt harveft, and a man about 90, who mowed 
hay. 

Rivers. — Stinchiar is the principal river in the parifli. It 
has its fource in the parifli of Barr, about twelve miles above 
the village of Colmonell. Its water is moft clear and tranfpa- 
rent, fo that a fifh lying at fix or eight feet deep in it, can be 
diftinclly feen from its banks. It produces falmon and trout ; 
but the quantity caught is only fufficient for the confumption 
of the inhabitants. Several ft reams or rivvlets, fall into the 
Stinchiar, particularly the Afshill, the Dufk, the Muick, 
and the Feoch. 

Woods.— -It is univerfally believed, from traditional authori- 
ty, that, in former times, there was a continued wood from 
Knockdolian hill, to the kirk of Barr, an extent of ten miles : 
and it may be ftated, as an additional proof in fupport of that 
idea, that, in molly grounds, large oak trees are often found in 
that part of the country. There is alfo ftill a great deal of wood 
in the neighbourhood. The banks of the Stinchiar areadorned 
with natural woods, almoft the whole length of its paffage thro' 
the parifli. There is alfo much wood upon the Muick; and for an 
extent of three miles atleaft, upon theDuik. The timber grow- 
ing in thefe woods, is oak, afh, elm, birch * and there are alfo 
H 2 great 



60 Statijlical Account 

great quantities of hazle nuts, wild ftrawberries, and wild ap- 
ples in them. Thefe trees grow naturally on banks and fteep 
grounds, which could be turned to any other purpofe equally 
profitable. The price of wood here twenty or thirty years a- 
go, was a mere trifle, as there was then very little confump- 
tion for it in the country, and no good roads to convey it to o- 
ther places ; but now it gives a better price. Good oak and 
afh, will fetch from is. 6d. to 2S. per cubical foot. The home 
confumption is greatly increafed, by the building of better 
houfes, and by better implements of hufbandry, particularly 
carts, of which, thirty years ago, there were only two in the 
parifh, but now there is fcarcely a farmer who has not one, 
two, three, and fome even more in his poffcffion. 

Hills. — Carleton hill rifes with a very fteep afcent and is fi- 
tuated fo near the fea, on the bay of that name, that at full tide, 
there is, little more than room for the traveller topafs, without 
being in danger from the rocks that threaten to tumble upon 
him. It rifes 518 yards above the level of the fea. Knock- 
daw and Knocknormon are equally high, but being farther 
removed from the fhore, and Handing near more elevated 
grounds, they do not fo much ftrike the eye of the traveller, 
liut the moft remarkable is Knockdolian, whofe height is 650 
yards above the level of the fea ; and as it rifes in a conical 
fhape, it is both a moft beautiful object to the traveller by 
land, and of fingular fervice, as a confpicuous land-mark, to 
veffels at fea, when they enter the Firth of Clyde. 

Number of Farms, bV. — The lo we ft rent paid for any farm 
in the parifh, is L. 7 ; the higheft about L. 200. 

The number of farms may amount to - - 116

is given to have ilieep with fine wool, though there are lome 
in the diftricl. 

To the north of the Stinchiar, and along the Ihore, there is a 
great deal of land fit for fatteningboth fheep and black cattle, and 
to that ufe feveral farmers appropriate their ground. But the 
breeding of cattle is a more general object in this part of the 
country. It is fuppofed, that nearly one fifth part of the pa- 
liifi is arable land, or capable of being made fo. Agriculture, 
however, has been lefs attended to, as within thefe twenty or 
thirty years, the price of fheep and black cattle has been more 
than doubled, whereas the value of corn has continued nearly 
the fame. Such encouragement alfo is given to importation 
of Iriih grain, as tends greatly to deprefs the hulbandry of this 
neighbourhood. 

Rent — The valued rent of the parifh is L. 5945 Scots ; the 
real about L. 3000 Iterling. Within thefe twenty years part, 
the rent has been doubled, almoll universally, and in fome 
inftances, more than trebled. A fajrm in tlie vicinity of the 
village of Colmonell, paid, twenty years ago, L. 25 ilcrling. 
The pofTeflbr, at the expiry of his leafe, went out a beggar-

a lucrative bargain. It was too large for the former tenant to

v.tj upon their refpec~live poiTefiions. This is mentioned to 
prove the hazard ,of putting too much improveable land, 
in the hands of one perfon. The rent per acre varies •, but in 
the near neighbourhood of the village, there are fome fingle 
acres iet to tradefmen, from 20s. to 40s. per acre. 

O^/.-^Oats, peafe, bear, or barley, and potatoes, are in 
general the crops in the parifh. Of oats there is ufually given 
from feven to eight Winchefter bufhels per Scots acre of feed, 
and the crop yields, from three to four returns on ordinary land. 
But when the ground has been refted for fome years, and en- 
riched with dung and lime, from fix to nine returns may be 
expected. The oats in the fertile parts of the country, will 
yield from eight to nine ftone of meal per boll. But the oats, in 
the upper or muir grounds, which includes by far the great- 
eft part of the parifh, is of a much inferior quality. The boll 
will not yield above fix ftone of meal and feldom above three 
feeds are reaped. In thefe hilly grounds, little bear is fown, 
or peafe ; but fome rye, which anfwers much better than any 
other crop. Where the land is in any tolerable good heart, 
four bufhels of barley is reckoned fufficient feed for an acre.. 
Of common bear a larger allowance is requifite. The barley will 
Weigh from forty-eight to fifty pound per bufhel. The com- 
mon bear weighs lefs, by eight, ten, or twelve pounds. The 
j'eafon for fowing corn and peafe, is any time in the month of 
April, when the ground is dry, and in proper condition to re- 
ceive the feed .: that of bear and .barley about Whitfunday. 
Harveft ufually commences about the middle of Auguft ; and 
h» generally over by the end of September. In 1782, when 
much damage Was fuftained in other placeb by an early froft, 
ihe crops upon Stinchiar were generally cut down before it ap- 
peared.— -Great quantities of potatoes are raited in the parilh, 
and anfwer very .well, evxrn in the wi'.deft parts, where other-

crops do not.Theyare thechicf meansof fubfiftenceto the poor- 
er clafles of people, for at lead three quarters of the year. No 
one who has land in his pofleffion, refufes a potatoe vigg to a 
poor perfoa ; and very often they have both land and dung 
given them, for nothing. They have lately got into the me- 
thod of fetting potatoes with the plough. The ground is plow- 
ed twice or thrice, and perfectly cleaned of weeds : It is then 
dunged, the dung is plowed in, and the land is harrowed. 
The plowman than begins at one fide of the field, and makes 
a furrow. A number of people follow him dropping in the 
feed, fo that the row is fet as foon as the furrow is drawn. As 
he returns with the plough, he covers the potatoes with a light 
furrow, and follows the fame plan, till the whole field is gone 
over. The feed potatoes are fet at fix or eight inches, and the 
rows are placed at three feet diftance from each other. To 
dung the whole field is judged better for the land, and for the 
crop that is to follow, than to lay the dung only in the furrow, 
when the potatoes are fet. Befides the work is much more er,~ 
peditioufly carried on. The diftance of the row admits a horfe 
and plow to lay up the earth to the potatoes, fo often as may 
be neceffary. A crop of wheat has been tried after the po- 
tatoes fet in this manner, and has turned out very well. 

The crops produced in the parifti, are of late years, more 
than fufficient for the maintenance of the inhabitants. The 
towns of Girvan and Ballantrae, have received the furplus. It 
is only of late years, that the farmers have had any encourage- 
ment to raife more grain than was neceilary for the confump- 
tion of the neighbourhood •, remote from any good market, 
and no cart road by which it could be conveyed to a diftance. 

Roads. While the making and repairing of roads de- 
pended only upon the ftatute-labour, nothing to purpofe ei- 
ther was, or could be, done in this part of the country. An 

aft 



Stati/lical Account 



act. was therefore applied for, and obtained, to convert the 
ftatute-labour into money. The conversion is at the rate of 
25 millings fterling for each L. 100 Scots of valued rent. In 
the act, the feveral roads that were judged moft necefTary, 
were defcribed : One by the more from Girvan to Ballantrae, 
and thence to the confines of the county, by Glenap. This 
one is already formed, and has lately received fome improve- 
ments ; but there are ftill fome arduous and difficult pulls in 
it, which are hardly to .be avoided. The other from Gir- 
van, by the village of Colmonell. Upon the credit of the act 
money was borrowed, and the work was begun. But it was 
foon found, that any fum which could be raifed on that fund, 
would be very inadequate to the purpofe. Some affiftance ha- 
ving been obtained from Government, the work was gradually 
carried on through the parifh of Ballantrae. But a difference 
of opinion as to the direction of thefe two roads, in the parifh 
ef Colmonell, having taken place, an engineer was employed 
tcr make a particular furvey of the whole country, and to draw 
out the plan of a road, which mould be, on the whole, the 
leaft expenfive and exceptionable. The plan he formed was 
univerfally approved of-, and will be completed in the courfe 
©f the year 1 791 . 

Improvements.'— - .Whatever progrefs may have been made 
in other places, yet in the parifh of Colmonell improvements 

are ftill in their infancy. Till of late, there were very few 

mclofures indeed ; but now the farmers are all ftriving with 
one another who fhall have their grounds firft inclofed. In 
fome inftances, the proprietor indoles the ground, and charges 
the tenant fix per cent, or upwards, of intereft for the expence 
he lays out. Sometimes, however, the tenant himfelf is at 
the expence ; the proprietor being obliged to refund him the 
value of the dykes at the expiration of the leafe, if he then 

quits 



of Cdmomll 



quits the pofieflion of his farm. There are few in the lower 
part of the parifli, who have not their arable and meadow 
land feparated by dykes from their pafture ; and many have 

their whole farms inclofed and divided The practice of 

inclofing is gradually extending itfeif over the parifli; and is 
judged to be the moil profitable fpeciesof improvement, that 

the nature of the country in general will admit of. The 

dykes are commonly built with dry ftone, and are ufually about 
five feet high, about two feet wide at the foundation, and 
ten or twelve inches at the top.— But this practice of inclo- 
fing, together with the increafe of rents, has occafioned the 
difmiffion of herds and cottagers; and, of confequence, has ma- 
terially affected the population of the diftncl:. Many perfons 
of that defcription lived in the parifli ; and their fervices were 
particularly neceffary while the ground was open. They had 
from their mafters a houfe and yard, a fmall piece of land, 
grafs for one or more cows, &amp;c. the value of which was ac- 
counted trifling, while the rents were low : But when they 
came to be doubled or trebled, the farmer began to calculate 
the colt, and to eftimate what the grafs of every cow was 
worth, &amp;c. and thus they were fpurred on to inclofe their 
grounds, that they might not haveoccafion for fuch a burden iu 
future. But however profitable this expedient might be to 
the farmer himfelf, it has evidently proved inimical to the po- 
pulation, and perhaps to the real improvement, of the coun- 
try. About twenty years ago there was hardly a tenant who 
hadnotone ormore of thefe cottagers on his farm, whereas now 

there are very few of them in the whole parifh. The 

cottages were the nurferies of fervants ; but their inhabi- 
tants have now been removed to towns, and having bred up 
their children to other employments, farm fervants have become 
exceedingly fcarce throughout the whole country.

In the lower parts of the parifh, the improvement of arable 
land has of late years been principally carried on by lime, which 
turns out to exceeding good account. Tbereisgreat plenty of good 
limeftone ; but coals lie at the diftance of fourteen miles. 

Antiquities. — There are feveral remains of antient buildings 
in this parifh. Thecaflles of Caikton, Knockdaw, Kirkhill, 
Craigneil, Pinwhirry, Kildonan, &amp;c. and alfo a number of 
cairns, or large heaps of flones in different places, which are 
certainly antient enough ; but for what purpofe they were col- 
lected, is not certainly known. 

Heritors* — There are feventeen proprietors of land, only 
two of whom refide in the parifh. 

ManufaElures A tan-work was fet up about a twelve- 
month ago •, it is at prefent on a fmall fcale, but will probably 

be enlarged. An woolen manufacture would be the mofl 

proper one for this part of the country.—— There are in the 
pariih 24 weavers, 7 of whom refide in the village \ 13 fhoe- 
makers, 13 taylors, 7 wrights, 10 mafons, 5 blackfmiths, 5 
millers, and 2 clothiers, all employed in working for the neigh- 
bourhood. There are alfo 5 corn mills, a barley mill, and a 
lint mill. 

Churchy £jV.— -An infeription upon a (tone above the old 
church door bears date 1591. The church \tf as taken down 
and built new from the foundation in 1772. It is in good re- 
pair J but not being in a centrical fituation, it has been euf- 
tomary for the minifter of Colmonell once a month to perform 
divine fervice at a place called Barrhill, five miles diftant from 
if. The manfe was built in 1762*, and has fince been re- 
paired. The ftipend amounts to 99 bolls, 1 firlot of victual^

Population. The return to Dr. Webfter, about 40 years 

ago, was 1 8 14 fouls. There are now only about 1 100 in the 
parifli ; all of whom are of the eftablifhed church, excepting 
56 Seceders of the Antiburgher denomination, and 6 Came- 

ronians. No authentic account can be given of births, 

deaths, and marriages, as no full record of them has been 
kept here, fince Government impofed a duty upon them, 
which few of the pariftiioners chufe to pay ; and the parifli 
clerk is forbid to record any for whom the duty ij not paid. — 
The population has been gradually decreafing for thefe 30 
years part; partly owing to the union of farms ; but princi- 
pally, to the difmiflion of cottagers. There is now often but 

one family, where formerly there were three or four. In 

the village there are 34 dwelling houfes, all thatched, except 
the manfe ; 4 fliopkeepers, who fupply the neighbourhood 
with grocery, hardware, &amp;c. 2 inns, with very indifferent ac- 
commodation for fo frequented a road, as this is likely to be- 
come ; and 4 'public houfes, for the lower ranks of people; 
particularly during the four great fairs, which are held here 
the firft Monday of every quarter, at which a good deal of 
common countrv bufinefs is trarfacled- 

School. — There is an eftablifhed fchoolmafter at the church, 
with a fchool-houfe, fufliciently largo, and a dwelling houfe 
for the mafter : but the extent of the parifh renders it impof- 
fible for him to be ufeful to a fourth part of the inhabitants. 
It is very ufual, therefore, for three or four farmers in the  
country to join in hiring a private teacher, to inftruct their 
I 2 children.

children. The fchool -matter's falary is i meiks from each 
L. 100 Scots of valuation. There is alfo a fmall farm, which 
was mortified to the heritors and kirk-feffion, for the benefit 
of the Lhool, the yearly rent of which is L. 16 fterling •, one 
half whereof goes to the fchoolmafter, and the other half to 
poor boys in the parifli, of a particular dcfcription. 

Seceders. — Their meeting-houfe for public worfhip is with- 
in a quarter of a mile of the village. Their congregation, 
though collected from the parifhesof Ballantrae, Girvan, Barr 
and Colmonell, is after all but fmali. They have never been 
able to make any great acceffion to their intereft in Canick, 
owing very much to the prudence and moderation, with which 
the fettlement of minifters, on the eftablifhment, in this part 
of the country, has been conducted ; an example which ought 
to be imitated, by all who wifh well to focfety, and to the in- 
tercfts of religion. 

Poor. There are few common beggars, or perfons total- 
ly defticute, belonging to the parith, but a confideraMe num- 
ber of people who require occafional fupplies. The number 
upon the lilt at prefent is 24. The only fund for their relief 
arifes from the collections made at the church doors, and the 
Jnterelt of a fmall fum laved in a courfe of fome years. M he 
money annually di(triluted, on an average of three years, end- 
ing 1790, was L. 20: 14 fttrling. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatwns. The inhabitants, in general, 

are fober and indultrious. They pay a proper regard to their 
religious duties, and, in particular, areat.entive to the dictates 
ofjullice, humanity, and charity to their brethren. A num- 
ber of them, though they have received but a very common 

and

and ordinary education, yet poffefs a degree of judgement and 
knowledge, both in fpiritual and temporal matters, exceeded 
by few. They enjoy life very happily, and are ftemingly 
pleafed with their fituation. Till of late years, their dwelling 
houfes were very uncomfortable ; but now they are making 
great improvements in them, particularly when they receive 
any afliftance from their landlords to excite, or to enable 
them. One great bar to improvement is the fhortnefs of lea- 
fes. They are fcldom given for more than nineteen years; 
and, in many cafes, (where jhe lands are ftriclly entailed) 
cannot be granted for a greater length of time. This affords 
but little fcope, and lefs encouragement, to extenfive or ex- 
penfive exertions. 

Another difadvantage is, the want of more crofs roads fov 
the purpofe of carrying manure, &amp;c. particularly one up the 
river Dufk, to join the (hire of Ayr to that of Wigton, and 
the ftewartry of Kirkcudbright *. 

The laft great bar to improvement is, the cuilom univer- 
fally prevailing through the country, of landlords binding

Knockdolian hill, to the bridge of Balla.itrae, is in a line of fix-

(COUNTY OF AYR.) 

By the Rev. Mr. George Smith.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name, Situation, Extent, and Surface. 

SOME have imagined that the name originated from a fmall 
number of the Gauls, having made a temporary fettlc- 
ment in the village. But the derivation cannot now be afcer- 
tained *. Jt lies in that divifion of the county of Ayr called 
Kyle, in the prefbytery of Ayr, and fynod of Ayr and Glas- 
gow. Its length is thirteen meafured miles, and it is from 
four to five miles broad. The furface is very different. To- 
wards the caftern boundary, there is a good deal of mof, 
muir, and heathy ground. The foil, at the head of the parifli, 
next Strathaven, is light and gravelly : But in the lower and 
more cultivated grounds, there is rich clay, and in fome 

places 

* Many names of places in the parifti are derived from the Cel- 
tic, as Achenbart, or the field of the bards, Letifien, the defcent of 
the hjll, &amp;c. Gall, in that language, fignifies ftrangcr, but ton feems 
to be of Saxon original.

\ 

places loam. The bottom is, in general, a blue or red clay, and 
in fome parts rather inclined to till. 

Rivers and Fi/h. — The Irvine, which rifes a little above 
Loudoun hill, runs on the northern boundary of the parifh, 
and is joined by many rivulets in the neighbourhood, in parti- 
cular by the Glen, the Gower, the Burn-Anne, and the 
Ceffnock. 

All thefe ft reams have very good trout, and the Irvine, at 
times, a few falmon. The Burn-Anne trouts, though large, 
are rather foft, as the ftream conies from moffy grounds \ 
thofe of the Irvine, and of the Ceffhock in particular, are little 
inferior to char. Liming the lands has diminifhed the num- 
ber of the trouts, from the noxious quality of that article 
to hili. But their greatcft enemy is man. The few falmon 
that get over the mill-dams, are deftroyed by means of hand 
nets and harpoons. Scarcely one falmon in afeafon can be 
caught by the rod, where 20 or 30 years ago, any fkilful perfon 
might, for his amufement, have killed fecres of them. 

Lech. — There are two lochs in the parifh; one Loch Gait, 
at its eaftern extremity, is a fheet of deep and clear water, a- 
bcunding in trouts and very large eels. It is the chief fource 
of the water of Even, or Aven, which joins the Clyde below 
Hamilton, and gives name to the parifh of Strathaven, or A- 
vcndale. The other is Brunt-wood loch, towards Mauchlin. 
It breeds an immenfe number of wild ducks •, and, in fevere 
winters, great flocks of fwans frequent it for the benefit of the 
fprings. A bird, which tiie people here call a hether blutter, 
perhaps it is the bittern (it makes a loud roaring noife) built its 
•neft on the ifland in the loch, about eight or nine years ago, 
but as fome fuperftitious people fuggefted tha.tits loud and un- 
common 



of Galjlon. 73 

common cries forboded no good, foon either deftroycd or 
banifhed. 

Air, Climate, Hills, &amp;c— The air may be called rather 

moift, but it is not unhealthy. In common with all the 

weftern coaft of Scotland, there are frequent rains, and high 
winds; the latter of which are fuppofcd to contribute much 
to the general health of the inhabitants. Sometimes, even in 
fummer, and autumn, the rain falls in confiderable quantities, 

and in large drops. The mod remarkable hills are Cairn- 

faigh, which, in the Celtic, fignifies, The Hill of Peace ; where 
probably, in former times, fome truce or other agreement 
was made between two neighbouring clans, regarding their 
boundaries ; and thus the large dykes, and cairns of ftones, 
on the top of Cairnfaigh may be accounted for. Mol-mount 
( Mollis Mons ) is arable to the top. The view from this hill 
is delightful ; a great part of Carrick, moft of Kyle, and all 
Cunningham being foen from it. In the neighbourhood, there 
is under view, the antient feats of CeiTnock Tower andLoudoun 
Caftle, with their extenfive woods and plantations, the thriving 
village of Galfton, the turnings and windings of the Irvine, 
&amp;c. ; and, with regard to diftant objects, in fine weather, the 
ifland of Arran, (which ferves as a barometer to this country), 
and even Ireland itfelf, may be clearly diftinguilhed. 

Antiquities. — There are the remains of a druidical temple on 
the top of Mol-mount-hill, of a circular for.n, and of about fixty 
feet diameter. A great part of the circle has of late been deftroy- 

ed, and the Hones taken away. Some years ago, in Mr 

Brown's .grounds of Waterhaughs, an antient burial place was 
dug up ; an account of which was publifhed at the time by 

Dr. Lawrie minifter of Loudoun. At Claymore, about ten 

years ago, an urn, containing fome filver and other coins was

different forts were difcovered. They were fold for the price 
of bullion, and brought only about L. 3. The infcription on

Among other antiquities there may be mentioned, ieveral 
fmall hills, called Laws, on which tbere are cairns of ftones. 
Alfo a place call Beg above Allinton, where the brave Wal- 
lace lay, in afpecies of rude fortification, with only 50 of his 
friends, yet obtained a complete victory over an Englifh officer 
of the name of Fenwick, who had 200 men under his com-* 
mand. This gallant hero, it is well known, had feveral places 
of retirement towards the head of this parifli, and in the 
neighbourhood, fome of which retain his name to this day ; 
W allace-hill in particular, an eminence near the Galla-law, 
and a place called Wallace-Gill, in the parifli of Loudoun, a 
hollow glen, to which he probably retired for fhelter when 
purfued by his enemies. 

Sheep —There are fome fheep farms in the parifh, in which 
•about 2500 fheep, of the black-faced or Lammer-muir breed 
are grazed. The pafture is exceedingly healthy, and there is 
feldom any lofs by difeafe. In the lower grounds a few En- 
glifli (beep are alfo kept. The wool of the muir fheep is coarfe, 
and it takes from eight to nine fleeces to the trone ftone. 

Slate of Agriculture. — There are about 100 farmers, but on- 
ly 80 ploughs ; two farmers fometimes joining to keep one 
plough. Allowing 30 acres to every plow, the number in ac- 
tual tillage w-ould be 2400 ; and, as the tenants are in gene- 
ral allowed to plough only one third of their farms, hence the 

who's 



of Galjlon. 75 

whole arable land in the parifh may be calculated at three 
times as much, or 7200 acres ; of which one-third is plough- 
ed, another paftured, and the remainder cut for hay. 

After fix years reft, and liming the land at the rate of 100 
bolls of flacked lime per acre, it is ufual to take three fucceflive 
crops of oats. The lime is fpread upon the green fwaird be- 
fore plowing, fometimes not many weeks before the ground 
is plowed, which muft occafion much of the lime being 
loft at the bottom of the furrow ; yet it is aftonilhing what 

large crops are produced in this way. Very little bear or 

barley is fown. Peafe, beans, &amp;c. thrive extremely well, and 
fhould certainly intervene between the crops of oats; though 
there is a great deal of difficulty in preferring them, owing to 
frequent rains in harveft. 

The produce is chiefly oats ; and, for thefe two or three 

years laft paft, a fmall quantity of wheat. Potatoes are 

raifed in great quantities, both by the farmers and by the in- 
habitants of the village; the laft renting the land neareftthem, 
at 3d. i and 4d per fall, and manuring and dreffing the crop 
for themfelvcs. And though the tradefmen might certainly 
buy their potatoes as cheap from the farmers, yet this practice 
tends much to promote their health, and amufement at bye- 
hours, when otherwife they would be idle, and ought there- 
fore to be encouraged. 

One great article of produce is eheefe, made after the Dun- 
lop manner, and equally good*. It is fent to Kilmarnock, 
Paifley, Glafgow, and Edinburgh. 

The farmers, in general, asaife their own (lock of black 
K 2 cattle.

cattle. Many calves in the fpring are fed for the Edinburgh 

market; and a few horfes are bred in the rarifn. More 

grain is raifed within the bounds of the diftrict than what is 
neceflary for its confumption, and the furplus is carried to the 
great manufacturing towns in the neighbourhood. 

The harveft of 1782 was remarkably kite, a great quantity 
of fnow having fallen before the crop was cut ; and the corn 
was picked out from among it, in the belt maimer it could. 
In feveral fields the grain was covered with frozen fnow, and 
hardly any part of the crop was to be feen. 

The foil, particularly next Straven, is well adapted for 
turnips, but little of that root has as yet been raifed. From 
20 to 30 acres are generally fown with flax, and the produce 
is drefled by a water-mill in the village. The quantity of flax 
manufactured there, is from 900 to 1000 {tones avoirdupoife, 
and about the half of that quantity is heckled. Little flax is 
drefled in any other manner ; though, by the hand, is by far the 
fafeft method, and fubject to much lefs wafte, than when wa- 
ter mills are employed. Clover and rye-grafs, efpecially the 

latter, is fown for hay, when the land is allowed to reft 

White clover is, in moft places, the natural product of the 
foil. 

Proprietors and rent. — There are about 50 heritors great and 
fmall ; of whom Mifs Sco' of Scotftarvet is by much the moft 
confiderable, having purchafed, in 1787, the cxtenfive baro- 
nies of Ceflhock, Hainingrofs, and others. — The valued rent 
of the parifh is L. 4644 : 3 : 10, Scots ; the veal rent from 

L. 5000 to L. 6000 fterling. -The greater part of the land 

is inclofed. Good land lets for about 2os per acre, and near 
the village at double the fum. 



Woods 



of Galjion. 77 

• Woods and Planting.'- There is a great deal of fine old plant- 
ing, many very large Scots firs, and fome copfe wood round the 
houfe of CefTnock. Within thefe 20 years, very extenfivc 
plantations have been raifed by Mr Brown of Water-haughs, 
and other proprietors in the parifh. Near old Barr caftle, there 
is a very remarkable old elm, which meafures 24 feet round, has 
1 2 feet of trunk at the top, and fpreads itfelf into 24 branches, 
many of which, are themfelves large trees. A tree called the 
Maiden-Oak, was lately fold for about L. 13. By the oldeft 
Jeafes on the Barr eftate, the tenants were bound to plant, at 
leaft twelve afh yearly. This accounts for the beautiful ap- 
pearance of the farm houfes on that property, which are in 
general furrounded by trees. 

Fowls and Birds. — There are here all the common tame 
fowls of the country. The muirs yield plenty of groufe, and 
partridges abound in the low grounds. Within thefe 13 or 14 
years, fome wood-larks have been feen in the plantations of 
Ceffhock ; and about the fame time bull-finches ftift appeared ; 
and have now increafed to a very confiderable number. They 
do great damage to the bloflbms of the plumbs, and fmall 
fruit ; a lofs which is fcarcely compenfated by their deftroying, 
at the fame time, fome grubs and caterpillars, and filling 
the neighbouring woods with the mufic of their pipes- Wood - 
cocks, in the winter and fpring are to be found in great num- 
bers; and within 5 or 6 years, pheafants have bred in the pa- 
nth, but have been, in a great meafure, deftroyed by poachers. 

Minerals. — Mifs Scot has a valuable coal, now working, 
within a quarter of a mile of the village ; and alfo an exceed- 
ing good lime quarry, which fulTiciently fenres all the tenants 
on this part of her extenfive domains It is worthy of re- 
mark, that within thefe 40 or 50 years, all the fuel made life of

here, was peats from Galfton muir, a few coals excepted, 
which were carried in lacks on horfes backs, from Caprington t 
near Kilmarnock, through almoft impartible clay roads. The 
late Mr Wallace of Ceffnock is the gentleman, to whom this 
neighbourhood owes the important advantages both of coal and 
lime, which have fo materially contributed to its improvement, 
There is no doubt, that all the muir edges abound in iron ore, 
which might be fmelted to great profit. At Cairnfaigh, there 
was lately difcovered, on the banks of the Aven, a vein of 
very rich iron ore ; and feveral tons were wrought out by the 
Muirkirk company. But it was given up for want of proper 

roads to convey it. The Burn- Anne throws up at times 

fome good pebbles, which are fuppofed to come from the 
fides of the Mol-mount-hill, where it is faid they abound.— 
There are many flone quarries in the parifh ; and, clofe to 
the village, abundance of ftone of a red colour, which is well 
calculated for building. 

Population. — In 1755, the population of Galfton amounted 
to 1013 fouls. 

It appears, from an actual and pretty accurate furvey taken 
in 1790, that the number had increafed to 1577, of which 
1 2 19 were examinable. 

In the village of Galfton, which, An. 1779, contained on- 
ly 455 fouls, there are at prefent 573, of which the follow- 
ing is an analyfis.

Since 1779, about "40 houfes have been built ; and, feu-

ing continues to go on rapidly, infomuch that 12 new houfes 

were feued this year. The conveniencies for building and 

carrying on manufactures are very great ; to which may be 
added, reafonable ground-rents, abundance of (tone and lime, 
excellent water, and a rich and populous country. Till of late, 
the chief manufacture was Ihoes, which were made for mer- 
chants in Kilmarnock, and exported. Now, the weaving of 
lawn and gauze is the chief object ; and, if a little money 
were laid out in ellabliihing thefe manufactures, while Paifley 
and Glafgow flourifli, this parifli might expect to thrive. 

The firfl loom for filk or light work, was fet up here in 
1787. At this time there will be about 40. The weavers 
of Galfton depend on Glafgow and Paifley. It would be defir- 
able to have an woollen manufacture attempted. The premi- 
ums given by theTruftees might contribute to its eftablifhment. 
There is fome paper manufactured, but it is chiefly of the 
coarfe fort. 

Local Ciiftoms. — It is ufual for even the women to attend 
funerals in the village, dreft in black or red cloaks. An- 
other Angular cuftom prevails here : When a young man 
wiflies to pay his addrefies to his fweet-heart, inftead of going 
to her father's, and profefiing his paffion, he goes to a public 
houfe; and, having let the land-lady into the fecret of his at- 
tachment, the object of his withes is immediately fent for, 
who never almoft refufes to come. She is entertained with 
ale and whiflcy, or brandy ; and the marriage is concluded on. 
The fecond day after the marriage, a creeling, as it is called, 
takes place. The young wedded pair, with their friends, af- 
femble in a convenient fpot. A fmall creel or bafket is pre- 
pared for the occafion, into which, they put fome {tones : 
The young men carry it alternately, and allow themfelves to be 
caught by the maidens, who have a kifs when they fucceed. Af-

ter a great deal of innocent mirth and pleafantry, the creel 
falls at length to the young hufband's (hare, who is obliged to 
carry it generally for a long time, none of the young women 
having companion upon him. At laft, his fair mate, kind- 
ly relieves him from his burden ; and her complaifance, in 
this particular, is confiJered as a proof of her fatisfaclion 
with the choice (lie has made. The creel goes round again j 
more merriment fucceeds, and all the company dine together, 
and talk over the feats of the field *. 

Churchy Manfe, Stipend, end Patron. — The church is an- 
tient, probably built before the Reformation. The manfe was 
built in 1727 •, but has fince been frequently repaired. The 
ftipendis 8 chalders, or 128 bolls of rieal, and about L. 8 in 
money, with a glebe. The living was the fame 100 years a- 
go. Mifs Scot is patron. 

State of the Poor The collections for the poor, with the 

intereft: of a fmall fum of money, bring in about L. 40. per an- 
num, which is distributed among two claries. The firft clafs con- 
fifts of the old,the infiim, young children, orphans, &amp;c. who 
have a weekly perifion. Such as are rendered unfit, by tem- 
porary ficknefs, to provide for 'themfelves and families, re- 
ceive only an occafional or interim fupply» 

The Seluon takes an inventory of the goods of fucli as have 
a weekly provifion, which, at their death, are fold for the be- 
hoof of the poor Intimation is given from the pulpit 

from time to time, to let no houfes to any perfon who is like- 
ly to be a burden on the parifh. There are no native beggars, 
but too many of that defcription from other parifhes. The

** font faites," may allude to a fimilar cuftom. 



%z Statijlical Account 

number of dated poor is from 10 to 12, of occafional from 
11 to 16. 

There is an univerfal fociety for the relief of the poor, at 
Newmills, with a fund which is of great ufe to tradefmen in 
diftrefs. Some of the natives of Galfton belong to it. One, 
on a very fimple principle, is eftablifhed in this parifh. It 
confifts of about 50 members, and is called the penny or half- 
penny fociety. It has no funds, which are too apt to be embez- 
zled ; but, when a brother is confined to bed by ficknefs, every 
member pays him a penny weekly, and if able to go about, 
though not to work, a half-penny. This inftitution is found 
to anfwer ; and might be adopted in other places with advan- 
tage. 

MifceUaneous 0lfervat'w?2s.— 'There are two great fairs at the 
village, one in July, the other in December. The firft (St. 
Peter's) has greatly fallen off, but the cuftom is ftill retained 
of kindling fires on all the neighbouring hills, the evening be- 
fore it is held. The great roads from Edinburgh to Ayr, 

by Riccarton, and from Glafgow to Dumfries, by Mauchlin, 
pafs through the village of Galfton. The roads are chiefly 
made and kept in repair by the ftatute-labour. There is 

an excellent parifh' fchool, and a fchool-houfe lately built, 
which accommodates 100 fcholars. A funday-fchool, erect- 
ed by Mrs. Scot in 1787, and maintained at her fole expence, 
is attended with very good effects. 

There are about 5 or 6 ale4ioufes in the village Kil- 
marnock is the neareft poft town. There are 7 corn mills, 
3 lint mills, and 1 paper mill. Of the former, one is known 
under the name of Patie's mill, and claims the honour of hav- 
ing given birth to that delightful fong, " The lafs of Patie's 
** mill." The banks of the Irvine, on which it is fituated, ab- 
fir .xted from the charms of the fair, might well have infpired a

poet of lefs powers and fenfibility than Ramfay, with the 

fentiments contained in that celebrated paftoral. The high 

multures formerly paid at thefe corn mills, are now, in a great 
meafure, bought up and abolilhed ; though, in the lands of 

Greenholm, and a few others, they ftillexift. The only 

fervices of a perfonal nature which remain, are, the common 
mill fervices, of thatching the mill, dragging home the millftone, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. and, on one eftate, that of bringing home the mas- 
ter's hay. The people are in general long lived ; many hav- 
ing died within thefe few years between 70 and 100.— The con- 
fumption is the moft prevalent diftemper, and the moft fatal. 
The fmall-pox makes frequent ravages; and inoculation is not 
fo common as it ought to be. The religious prejudice againil 
it is ftill great. Of above 500 who have been inoculated in the 

fpace of 12 years, not one has died. It may be added, 

that the inhabitants of Galfton are, in general, fober, induf- 
trious, and charitable to the diftrelTed. It is to be regretted, 
however, that inftead of the wholefome beverage of ale, they 
are now compelled, by the high duties on that article, to be- 
take themfelves to the ufe of whifky, which is equally deftruc- 
tive to the health, and to the morals of the people.

(COUNTY OF AYR.)</head> 



<p>The firjl part of the following very inter ejling paper, was drawn 
up by the Rev. Mr. James Mackinlay, and the ftcond, by the 
Rev. Mr. John Robertson, the Minijlers of that parifi. 

PART I. 

Origin of the Name, Extent, Climate, tsfc. 
* | S HE parifh of Kilmarnock in the county of Ayr and pref- 
bytery of Irvine, is, on many accounts, of very confi- 
derable importance, and furnifhes room for a variety of ftatif- 
tical obfervations. In regard to extent, it is about nine miles 
long, and four broad; bounded by Newmills upon the eaft, 
by Fenwick and Stewarton upon the north, by Kilmaurs up- 
on the weft, and by the river Irvine, which divides it from Ric - 
carton and Galfton, upon the fouth. The name Kilmarnock, ov 
Cellmarnock, is evidently derived from St Marnock, who is faid 
to have been a bifhop or confeffor in Scotland. He died, A. D. 

322, and probably was interred here. The appearance of 

the country is, in general, flat,, with a gentle declivity to the 
fouth. The foil is deep, flrong and fertile, but runs a littie 
into a kind of mofs towards the north eaft. The air, from its 

Ipcal 



of Kilmarnock, 85 

local fituation, and the frequent rains which fall in the weft 
of Scotland, is moift and damp, but is far from being unheal, 
thy. The inhabitants are feldom vifited with any epidemi- 
cal diftempers ; and, it has been obferved, that when the 
neighbouring fea-port towns of Ayr and Irvine are labouring 
under fuch diforders, Kilmarnock, though to appearance in a 
lefs healthy fituation, has been happily exempted. This per- 
haps, may, in fome meafure be attributed to a rivulet which 
runs through part of the town; which is not only ferviceable to 
fome of the man ufa£tures carried on there, but greatly contributes 
to the health of the inhabitants. Inftances of longevity, there- 
fore are not uncommon. A few years ago, a woman who 
lived in the town, died at the advanced age of 107. Several 
now alive, are between 80 and 100 •, and there is a porter ft 111 
able to walk about, and carry parcels, whofe age is afcertain- 
ed to be 105. 

Population. — The return to Dr. Webfter of the population 



of Kilmarnock, was 4403 fouls. 


In 1763, 


it amounted to 


about 5000. Its prefent ftate is as

The difference between the males and females in the town, 
muft ftrike the moft carelefs obferver. This, however, arifes 
from the wollen and cotton manufactures, which have induced 
feveral families, where the females were the moft numerous, to 
come and fettle in this place. That difference is not very mate- 
rial in the country part of the parifh. 

This vaft increafe of population has arifen from the progrefs 
©f manufactures, by which means, many families have been 
led to come from neighbouring parifhes to get employment 
here ; and partly, perhaps, from the regular and comforta- 
ble mode of living that has been eftablifhed ; which is always 
found to be peculiarly favourable to the increafe of the human 
fpecies. The annual average of births and deaths cannot, at 
prefent, be precifely afcertained, as few, or none of the dif- 
fenters enter their children's names in the parifh regifter. By 
this means, Government is not only deprived of a tax, but an 
injury may be done to their pofterityj who, in cafe of anydif- 
pute, will not have it in their power, from that authentic re- 
cord, to prove their age, propinquity, or extraction. From 
$e following extract, however, taken from this regifter,

ManufaElures. — Kilmarnock is one of the principal manufac- 
turing towns in Ayrfhire, and, for many year9 hn9 carried on 
a very confiderable trade. Manufactures were at firft gradual- 
ly introduced, but of late have made a very rapid progrefs. 

About fifty years ago, the principal trade was carried on 
by three or four individuals, who bought ferges and other 
woollen articles from private manufactures, and exported 
them to Holland. When the demand afterwards increafed, 
a company was formed, who erected an woollen factory for 
different branches of that bufinefs, which ever fince has con- 
tinued in a very flourifhing ftate. The fhoe trade was introdu- 
ced about the fame time •, and now the woollen and fhoe trades 
are the molt extenfive and important in the diftrict. Several 
fpinning jeanies, however, for cotton, have been lately erected, 
and a carding and fpinning machine for coarfe wool ; all o£ 
which feem to do very well. 

The following is an account drawn ud by the moft intelli- 
gent manufacturers in the town, of the prefent annual ave- 
rage value of the different branches carried on in Kilmar- 
nock.

In thefe different branches from two or three thoufand hands 
may be employed. There are 56 matter {hoemakers, who em-

manufacturers of ClafgowandPaifley alone. As a msnufactur-

Ing town tlxis place has advantages and difadvantages, which 
it may not be improper briefly to mention. Among the ad- 
vantages may be reckoned its fituation in the midft of a po- 
pulous and fertile country, where provifions of all kinds are to 
be had in abundance, and at moderate prices. Coal, fo ne* 
ceflary in almoft every branch of manufaclure, is found clofe 
to it in vaft abundance, and may be had eafier and cheaper than, 
in any other town in the neighbourhood. The town is fur- 
nilhed with a meal-market, plentifully fupplied with good and 
wholefome grain j and always a penny or three halfpence a 
peck cheaper than in the Glafgow or Paifley markets. Indeed 
all forts of provifions, efpecially meal, butter, eggs, and poul- 
try, are fo much cheaper in this part of the country, that they 
are conftantly carried to the Glafgow and Paifley markets, not 
merely to fupply the demands of thefe populous towns, but to 
bring greater prices than can be got for them at home. The 
town is alfo provided with an excellent market for all forts of 
butcher meat, which is reckoned by far the bejl in the neigh- 
bourhood ; in fo much that many families in Glafgow, at the 
diflance of 21 miles, are fupplied from it; induced, partly by 
the fuperior quality of the meat, and partly by an addition to 

the weight of an ounce and a half to the pound The 

chief difadvantage under which the place labours, is, its inland 
fituation, being about fix or feven miles dlftant from the fea. 
This occafions a confiderable expence in the land carriage of 
raw materials, ar. well as in their exportation, when manufac- 
tured* A propofal was made fome time ago to have this difad- 
vantage removed, by a canal from the fea below Troon-point, 
to the bridge at the fouthend of Glencairn-ftreek This under- 
taking would no doubt be attended with great expence ; but ns, 
from all accounts, it is practicable, (the lands through which 
it would run having no great afcent), if accomplilhed, it woul$

Certainly rentier Kilmarnock the moft eligible and flourifhlrig 
manufacturing town in the weft of Scotland *. 

Eccleftaftical State of the Pa rijh.— -There are in.Kilmarnock 
no lefs than five places of public worfhip. Firft, The parifh 
church, which is collegiate, and continued to be the only 
place of divine fervice, until the year 173 1. Being then 
found unable to contain the people of the parifh, the Town- 
Cpuncil and inhabitants next erected a handfome new church 
or chapel, in which the collegiate minifters officiated alter- 
nately; until 1763, when, owing to a violent fettlement, 
that took place by order of the General Afiembly, the pro- 
prietors of houfes called a minifter of their own, who was or- 
dained by the Prefbytery. There is a Burgher feceding 

meeting-houfe, ere&amp;ed in 1772 ; and an Antiburgher one, 
built in 1775 : and, finally, there is an old difienting meeting- 
houfe, connected with what is called, the Reformed Prefby- 
tery, erected in the neighbourhood of the town, An. 1785. 
It muft be obferved, however, that notwithftanding fo many 
divifions, the people in general, of all denominations, live to- 
gether in the beft habits of friendlhip, as Chriftians ought to 
do ; and that ecclefiaftical rancour, has fortunately given 
place to the milder difpofitions of forbearance, benevolence, 
and charity.

as Abbot of Kilwinning, to whom the patronage of Kilmar- 
nock originally belonged, difponed it to Robert Lord Boyd ; 
from one of whofe fucceffors it was purchafed by an Earl of 
Glencairn ; from whofe family it was lately acquired by Mifs 

Scot of ScotftaTvet. -There are two eftablifhed minifters. 

The living of the firft is wholly paid in meal : the quantity 
is eight chalders, wanting a boll ; and, with a glebe of 1 2 
acres, may be worth L. 1 20 per annum. The fecond charge, 
including a fmall glebe of 4! acres, may be calculated at nearly 
L. 105. 

Heritors. — The number of heritors in the parifh is about 
24 ; but, excepting Colonel Crawfurd of Crawfurdland, no 
confiderable proprietor refides in it. The greater part of the 
parifh is the property of Mifs Scot, ^ho has lately made ve- 
ry extenfive purchafes in this neighbourhood It is a fin- 

gular circumftance, in regard to the Crawfurdland family, 
that its prefent refpe&amp;able reprefentative, is the twenty-firft, 
lineally defcended from the original ftock, without the inter- 
vention of even a fecond brother. The Countefs of Loudoun, 
another proprietor, reprefents the antient family of the Muirs 
of Rowallen ; from whom the greater part of the fovereigns 
of Europe are defcended ; Robert III. king of Scotland, being 
the fon of Robert II. by Elizabeth Muir, daughter of Sir A- 
dam Muir, of Rowallen. 

State cf the Poor. — The poor, in fuch a large and populous 
parifh, it is to be expefted, muft be very numerous, and 
would require a confiderable fum for their fupport. The fo- 
cieties and incorporations are of great fervice in maintaining 
their indigent and diftreffed members, and thereby keeping

annually, among their poor and afflicted brethren, L.i8o.

The number of poor who are upon the penfion lift, and re, 
ceive weekly alms from the Seflion, is 80, befides others who 
receive occafional fupplies. The contribution, at the church 
and chapel, annually averages at L. ico; which, together 
with the intereft of L, 100, and fome occafional donations, 
is all that is diftributed among the pew. From thefe funds, 
they can only receive from 6d. to is. each, per week ; which, 
although it may affilt them a little, is by- no means able to fup^ 
port them in their own houfes, even when joined to the profits 
of any little labour which fome of them may have ftrength to 
perform. Begging, therefore, is allowed, and is a very great 
burden upon the inhabitants. The poor, indeed, will never 
be fuitably or permanently provided for, until the proprietors 
of land agree to affefs themfelves in a fum that may be ade- 
quate to this purpofe : and when \\ is confidered, that the 
greater part of the heritors are non-refiding, that they con- 
tribute nothing to the maintenance of the poor by their own 
perfonal charity, and that the value of their property is great- 
ly increafed by the manufactures and population of the place »

Ccah — There is an extenfive and profitable coal work in the 
parifh,'fbout half a mile to the fouth weft of the town. The 
mines are rich and abundant, affording coal of different qua- 
lities, fome fit for export, and fome for home confumption. 
The fpecies that is raifed for exportation, is known in this 
country by the name of Blind-coal. It is of a fine quality, and 
much efteemed. The quantity of this fpecies annually expor- 
ted, is 3289TV ton s j which, at 9s per ton, is L. 1390 : 1 : 5£. 
This immenfe quantity is carried by land to Irvine, about 
fix miles diftance, and from thence exported to djjperent places

In Ireland, as Cork, Dublin, Belfaft, Droghedu, Laim, Do-

fufficiency of water to carry the fmalleft craft. It is likewifi? 
exported to many of the Highland ifles, for the purpofe of dry- 
ing malt and corn, and burning of lime-ltone. The fur or 
feeiiig-coal, (fo called from the light it gives), is of a rich and 
caking quality, refembling the Englifh coal. The yearly 
home confumpt of thisfpecies is 52,143 loads, which, at 7d. 
per load, is L. 1520:16:9. The total income from this 
work, then, is ^2910:18:3^ per annum, which will pro- 
portionably increafe with the growing population and ad» 

vancing manufactures of the town The number of 

hands employed in raifing the abovermentioned quantities, 
and in carrying them to thefhore, is, at an average, 1221. 

The To%un. — The town lies low, and its form is extremely 
irregular. It is a burgh of barony, governed by two baillies 
and a council of feventeen, The firft charter, erecting it into 
a burgh, was granted An. 1591, in favour of Thomas Lord 
Boyd. A fecond charter was obtained, in 1672, in favour of 
William, Earl of Kilmarnock, which was ratified in parlia- 
ment the fame year. 

In 1 700, the Magiftrates and Town Council obtained 
a grant from the Kilmarnock family, of the whole common 
good, and cuftoms of the burgh, comprehending the com- 
mon green, (hops under the tolbooth, weights and meafures, 
&amp;c. It is in virtue of this grant that the corporation holds 
its prefent property, and is confulered as an heritor in the 
parifh. There are in the town five incorporated trades ; the 
bonnet makers, fkinners, taylors, fhoemakers, and weavers ; 
of which, the bonnet makers, incorporated in 1646, is the

preferving regularity and good order in the different branches 
of trade in which they are occupied. 

Schools. — There are two public and eftablifhed fchools in the 
town, befides a number of private ones, which are alfo found 
to be neceffary for the purpofe of educating the numerous 
children of this place. Firft, there is a grammar fchool, for 
the fole purpofe of teaching Latin and other languages. The 
mafter has L. 1 2 : 2 of falary, 5s. per quarter from each of 
his fcholars, befides a voluntary offering at Candlemafs. 
There i6 next an Englifh fchool : the mafter of which has 
L. 10 of falary, 2s 6d. per quarter from fuch as read Englifli, 
3s. from fuch as read Englifh and write, and 4s. from thofe 
who are alfo taught arithmetic. Thefe fchools are flouriftiing, 
and well attended. The frrft, indeed, had, fome time ago, 
fallen into difrepute ; but from the attention and ability of the 
prefent teacher, is increafing in numbers and celebrity. The 
other has always been well attended, and, for many years has 
confifted of more than ico fcholars. 

Inns and Akhottjes. — The number of inns and alehoufes in 
the town is 50,exclufive of fpirit (hops ; and, befides, three or 
four in the country. Thefe muft have a pernicious effecT: up- 
on the morals of the people ; for in proportion as the number 
of houfes of this nature is multiplied, the temptation to intem- 
perance, andtheeafe and fecrecy with which it maybe indulged 
are evidently increafed. In juftice, however, to the inhabitants 
of Kilmarnock, it muft be obferved, notwithstanding the great 
number of houfes of this defcription, yet that in general 
they are as fober and induftrious, as the people of any town 
of its fize in Scotland : Nay, to their praife, it muft likewife 
be obferved, that the ruinous practice of dram-drinking has 
of tate been, in a great meafur-, laid afide, and the more fa-

lutary and healthful beverage of ale or porter, introduced in 
its (lead. Nor mud it be omitted, that to fobriety and induftry, 
they add the amiable virtues of charity and beneficence. This is 
evident, not only from die large collections made every funday 
at the church doors, principally arifing from the charity of 
the middling and induftrious part of the community, but alfo 
from the extraordinary a£ls of generofity, which fome indivi- 
duals have performed. In particular, when the poor were 
in the utmoft diftrefs, during winter 1790, and when all that 
could be afforded from the ufual funds, was not able to pro- 
cure them even the common neceffaries of life, an individual, 
with a delicacy which did him peculiar honour, fent a conli- 
derable fum of money, in an anonymous card, to one of the 
minifters, to be laid out for their relief. 

PoJl-OJfice and 'Ettife. — There is a poll-office in the town, 
for this, and for the neighbouring parifhes. The mail-coach 
from Glafgow to Ayr paffes through Kilmarnock, by which 
letters are brought and fent every day. The poftage of a fm- 
gle letter from Edinburgh to this place is 4d. and from Glaf- 
gow 3d. The poft office yields about L. 400 per annum. The 
excifes on ale, fpirits, candles, &amp;c. produce about L. 1700 
more. 

Both thefe branches of revenue are rapidly increafing, with 
the trade and population of the place. 

Antiquities and Curiofiiles The only antiquities which 

feem worthy of notice, are Dean caflle, and Soules crofs. 
The former ftands about half a mile north-eaft from the 
town, and was the refidence of the noble, but unfortunate fa- 
mily of Kilmarnock. It is a very antient edifice, but no 
information can now be obtained of the time when it was 
built. In 1735, it was entirely confumed by fire. This ac- 
cident

cident was occafioned by the inattention of a maid fcrVaa^ 
who was preparing fome Hnt for fpinning, which unhappily took 
fire, by which means this noble and ancient ftruchire wa r . 
laid in ruins. In this fituation it ftill continues ; and the hand 
of time is gradually accomplifhing what the fury of the flames 
had fpared. On the top of an arch, and in the centre of the 
dining-room, an afh tree is at prefent growing, and has at- 
tained fome height, which the credulous fay, fulfils a pre- 
diction emitted in the time of the laft perfecution. The ruins 
from the fouth-weft have ftill a magnificent appearance, and 
ftrike the mind with the melancholy idea of fallen grandeur. 

Soules- crofs, which gives name to a quaiter of the 

town, is a ftone pillar of eight or nine feet high, fituated in 
the north^-ealt part of the town, near the entrance of the new 
church. It was erected in memory of Lord Soules, an En- 
glifli nobleman, who is fald to have been killed on the fpot, 
in 1444, by an arrow from one of the family of Kilmarnock, 
Some years ago, it was falling into ruins ; but the inhabi- 
tants of that quarter, frpm a commendable refpecl for this 
piece of antiquity, collected a fum of money among themfelvesj 
caukd the broken pieces to be put together, and again erect- 
ed it, with a fmall giit vane upon the top, bearing this inferip- 
lioii, L. SOULES, 1444. 

PART ii 

Country Part of the Par'i/Jj.— As nearly as can be collected 
without an actual admeasurement, there are about 5900 acres 
(Scots meafure) in the country or landward part of the parifh. 
This is valued in the cefs. books of the county, at L. 7025 
Scots, and pays the land tax accordingly ; but the real rent at 
prefent, including what is poflefled by proprietors, may be 

nearly 



of Kilmarnock. 97 

nearly L.5400 fterling; which is, at an average, above 18s 
per acre. Some particular farms are let confiderably higher^ 
at 25s or 26s, and one at 36s, and final! inclofures near the 
town from 50s to L.4 per acre ; while thofe at greater diftance 
from the town, and near the: muirs, are fometimes as low as 
1 2S. The rent of the different lands in the parifh, however, 
has lately been brought much nearer a level than formerly, 
by the good roads that are now made through the whole of it. 
About 20 years ago, Mr Orr of Barrowfield, who was pro- 
prietor of a large eftate at a diftance from the town, and 
neareft the muirs, feeing the importance that good roads 
would be of to his eftate, was at a great expence in opening a 
communication with the high-ways, leading to Glafgow and 
other towns, as well as in making feveral other valuable and im- 
portant improvements ; in confequence of which, his property- 
lias become as valuable as any in the neighbourhood ; and 
fome of the farms on that eftate, are amongft the higheft 
rented of any that are in it. 

Soil and Mode of Inclofing. — There is not much difference 
of foil throughout the parifh. In general, it is a ftrong 
rich foil, confifting of clay, with a mixture of fand, and 
near the muirs fome mofs. There are fome fine holms along 
the fide of the Irvine, confifting of fand and fine loam, 
brought down by the river and left on its banks after floods. 
It is a great detriment to the grounds in this parifh, as well as 
in the greater part of Ayrfhire, that the bottom is a ftrong 
till, almoft impenetrable by water; reaching, in general, 30 
or 40 fathoms deep, or even more, while the foil on the fur- 
face, is little more than a foot, merely what the plow has re- 
peatedly turned up to the influence of the weather. The 
confequence of this is, that the autumnal rams, which -fall pe - 
culiarly heavy in the weftern parts of the kingdom, having no 

Vol. II. N longer 



Htatijiical Account 



longer the heat of the fun, as in fummer, to exhale them, lie' 
and ftagnateon the furface of the ground, during the whole 
winter', which greatly injures it, and, for a r time, even deftroys 
its vegetative powers. The bad effects of this circumltance, 
however, are now not nearly fo much, nor fo generally felt 
as formerly. This, in a great meafure, is owing to the num- 
berlefs drains made by the ditches, which have been drawn, 
in all directions, for inclofing the grounds : For the common, 
or rather univerfal method of inclofing in this fertile part of the 
country, where ftones are fcarce, is by ditches, with haw- 
thorn hedges planted in the fides* or on the top of the banks. 
This method was little known, and ftill lefs practifed, till a- 
bout 35 or 40 years. Before that period, no inclofure was to be 
feen, except, :perhaps, one or two about a gentleman's feat, in 
all the wide, extended, and beautiful plain of Cunninghame. 
Hence, at the end of harveft, when the crop was carried from the 
fields into the barn-yard, the whole country had the appear- 
ance of a wild and dreary common, and nothing was to he 
feen, but here and there, a poor, bare, and homely hut., 
where the farmer and his family were lodged. The cattle too, 
were then allowed to wander about at pleafure through all the 
neighbouring fields, till the grafs began to rife in the fpring, 
and miferably poached all the arable ground, now faturated 
with the water that lay on the furface. To fuch a degree 
was this mifchief done, by the ranging of the cattle in fearch 
of food, when none was to be found, that, in many places, 
it deftroyed all profpect of any crop, worth the labour of the 
hufbandman, for the enfuing year ; and, in fome instances, 
for many years to come- But now the fcene is completely al- 
tered, and infinitely to the better. There is, at this time, 
fcarcely a fingle farm, in all that wide-extended plain, that is 
not inclofed with ditch and hedj;e, and moft of them with 
numbers of intermediate ones, to feparate the fields from each 

other. 



of Kilmarnock.

other. By this means, the farmers have it in their power to 
confine the cattle, through the winter, to the fields where they 
can do lcaft harm by poaching ; the water is moftly drained 
from the furface ; and the ground is, in fome degree, flicker- 
ed by the hedges from the feverity of the winter cold and 
florms. This, along w ith the other improvements made upon 
the foil, has rendered the grounds much more productive and 
fruitful than ever they were in any former period, probably 3 
or 4 times at lealt. In confluence, however, of this method of 
mclofurc with thorn hedges, fheep are nearly banifhed from 
this country ; nor is there any individual who can venture to 
keep any considerable number of them, at lcaft, of the wilder 
forts ; though the larger or tamer breeds might perhaps be tri- 
ed to advantage. 

Manures. — From the nature of the foil in general through 
ihis parifli, it is better calculated for producing grain, than feed- 
ing black cattle. In confequence of this, the improvements are 
principally directed to the meliorating of the foil, and preparing 
it for the plough. As no mavle of any kind has a3 yet been found, 
the manures made ufe of, are only the dung collected in the 
town, or at the different farms, together with coal-aflies and 
lime : Some fmall quantities of horn fliavings alfo have 
occafionally been brought from Ireland, and raife good crops 
for two or three years, without injuring the foil : The allies 
do well enough for a year or two, upon a fandy foil, but are 
prejudicial where there is clay : and it is only near the town 
where thefe can be had ; fo that, all th it the farmer has to de- 
pend on, is the dung made on his own farm, and lime. Of 
the lafl, there is fome in the higher parts of the parifli; but 
the greater part of what is ufed, is brought from the neighbour- 
hood, at the diflance of a few miles. Fifty bolls of fliells, 
or 100 bolls of flaked lime is commonly laid on, per acre, 
N 2 when 



I0O 



Statijlical Account 



when ground is to be broke up by the plow, and has not been 
lately limed before; but rather lefs (perhaps 70 or 80) if it 
has. But fome have gone much farther; and, when the 
ground was a very ftrong clay, and had never been limed be- 
fore, they have found it greatly to their advantage. One hun- 
dred and fifty or two hundred bolls have been ufed in this cafe. 
The ufual method, in this parifh, is, to fpread the lime on the 
ground, in the beginning of the winter before the field is bro- 
ken up. But fome judge it better to have it fpread on the 
ground fo long before, that it may remain on it for two win- 
ters and a fummer ; by which means, it becomes better incor- 
porated with the foil ; is not fo apt to fink into the bottom of 
the furrow made by the plow ; nor fo ready to hurt the enfu- 
ing crop, if it fhould chance to turn out a dry feafon after it is 
plowed down. It is, however, a general perfuafion, that 
land ought, if poffible, to be limed and dunged alternately, in 
order to receive the full benefit of lime as a manure : for if re- 
peatedly limed, without a fufficient quantity of dung, and 
plowed often, it is gradually exhaufted, and becomes, almoft, 
a caput mortuum. 

Crops. —Every intelligent farmer, in this diftrici, is now 
fenfible, that, a proper rotation of crops is of the utmoft im- 
portance in hufbandry ; and that the ground, with the fame 
manure, will continue in equal, or even in better heart, for 
at leaft double the time, under a rotation properly calculated 
for the foil, than whaHt will do under a conftant fucceflion of 
any one crop. The fame method, however, does not fuit all 
different foils ; and, perhaps, the rotation that is moft proper 
for each different foil, has not been fo much attended to any- 
where as it ought to have been, and is yet, in a great meafure, 
left unafcertained. But the proprietors of land, in this part 
of the country, have, almoft univerfally, adopted a plan of 

letting 



of Kilmarnock. loi 

letting their grounds, which, in a great meafure, prevents the 
tenants from making ufe of any rotation. In their leafes, 
they bind the farmer to plow only three years, and then to keep 
the ground for fix years in grafs. The leafes are in gener.il 
for 19 years, fo that a farmer has it only in his power, during 
that term to have two breaks of his farm, together with what he 
can plow in the laft year of his leafe. This plan is attend- 
ed with great difadvantages to the proprietor, to the tenant, 
and to the public. Under fuch a reftriclion, the whole ef- 
forts of the tenant to meliorate his ground, are confined to 
the firft break. Then he limes and dungs to the utmoft of his 
power; and, more efpecially, endeavours to lay down his fields 
as richly as pofhble, in order that he may have good returns 
during the courfe of the fecond break, without being at farther 
expence for manure, at a period of the leafe when he cannot; 
receive die full benefit of it. The confequence of this is, that 
"he greater part of the grounds are reduced to a very poor ftate, 
before the end of the leafe. The tenant again, when he has 
brought his grounds to a ftate in which they could more eafi- 
ly than at firft be rendered more productive, is reftrained in his 
exertions, becaufe he cannot reap the full benefit arifing from 
them, but muft probably leave it to another, or pay a higher 
rent for it himfelf, than he would otherwife have done, and 
thus his intereft is materially hurt : while the public fuffers 
like/wife, as more grain would undoubtedly have been raifed, 
had the farmer had equal encouragement, to exert himfelf as 
much, in the latter part of the leafe, as he found it for his in- 
tereft to do in the former. Befides, the term of tillage is too 
fhort to allow any proper rotation of crops. The ground is 
fown with oats when firft broke up, and everyone knows that 
the fecond year after breaking up, affords the beft crop of oats. 
Thefe two years, therefore, the ground muft be fown with 
the fame fpecies of grain, to enable the farmer to pay his rent, 

and 



102 



Statiftical Account 



and he can only make a change to another in the Iaft year of 
that break. Thus, they are nearly deprived of the power of 
obferving any regular rotation ; and every one muft fee the 
difadvantage that this muft prove to all concerned. The only 
reafon given for this reftraint is, to put it out of the power 
of the farmer to run out his grounds at the end of the leafe. 
But though he cannot, in confequence of this reftricTion, over- 
plow them ; yet, by doing little or nothing, during the laft 
break, he leaves them in a condition, poor enough to be high- 
ly detrimental to the intereft of the proprietor, whilft it proves 
an effectual check to the genius of the farmer, and prevents 
his trying many ufeful and important experiments, by which, 
both tenant and landlord, and indeed the public at large, 
would be benefited. Perhaps it might be more expedient to 
let leafes upon one or more lives, leaving the period of their 
termination uncertain ; or the tenants might be allowed to 
plow as much for four years, as they could properly manure the 
third year, which would be a great encouragement to their ex- 
ertions *• 

Potatoes. 

* At the commencement of improvements in this part of the 
country, the fowing of what is called bear peafe, or giving a crop 
of peafe the fame pains, manure, and attention, that is ufually be- 
ftowed on a crop of barley, was found the heft mode of bringing 
in poor, weedy, or worn-out ground. The method practifed was as 
follows : In the beginning of winter, or as early in the fpring as pof- 
fible, the ridges were plowed and gathered; and then, as foon as the 
oat feed was fown, the ground was well harrowed, the folid crowns of 
the ridges were turned out by the plow. About 40 or 50 bolls of 
lime, and about as many carts of dung, or perhaps rather more of 
both, if the land was very poor and ftiff, were then led out and 
fpread upon each acre ; this was plowed down, and then fown with 
a late kind of fmall gray pea, which runs out to agreat length, and 
continues lengthening and flowering till the end of the feafon. They 

were 



of Kilmarnock. 103 

PotaPjts. — There maybe about 30 acres in the parilh plant- 
ed annually with potatoes, which yield, at an average, about 
30 bolls per acre, and may be worth from 8s to 10s per boll. 
The principal part of this crop is raifed on fpots adjacent to the 
town, by the inhabitants of Kilmarnock. Every tradefman 
takes as mu.h ground for 3d. or 4d. per fall, as he can pro- 
perly manure, and plants the potatoes with the fpade. This, to- 
gether with the hoeing and dremngthem through the fummer, 
and digging them up in the autumn, affords a healthful and 
agreeable exercife to the trades people, who are fo much 
neceilarily confined to their houfes and the produce makes a 
confiderable part of their provifion for 3 or 4 months at the end 
of autumn, and the beginning of winter-, which, exclufive of 
the value of their labour, they have at a pretty reafonable rate. 
After potatoes, it has now become a pretty general practice 
to fow wheat, which ufually makes a very good return. Lit- 
tle wheat indeed is raifed in any other manner ; though fome 
of the farmers have tried it after fallow, and when the fea- 
fon anfwers, have had very good crops. Yet here it muft al- 
ways prove very precarious, owing to the great autumnal rains, 
which the foil, in moft places, does not quickly enough drain 

o(Ti 

were generally fown about the end of April, orbeginning of May. la 
confequence of the particular nature of the pea, and the late fea- 
fon of lowing, there there were little peafe produced, but there was 
a complete and clofe covering given to the ground bytheftraw, which 
lying upon it all the feafon, cleaned and n elioratcd the foil to a 
furprifing degree ; and they fcarce ever failed to have, from what 
was before the pooreft ground, two excellent crops of oats, in the „ 
two fucceeding years ; and the land, after it had refted 6 years, 
was in very good order at the next break. This practice is now 
moftly given up, as the ground has all been brought in, but it was 
confidercd as the bell method of improving a poor foil.

bff; joined to the alternate frofts and thaws, which rake 
place in the fpring, by which it is fometimes raifed almoft 
wholly out of the ground, before it is poffible, from the 
wetnefs of the foil, to have it rolled to advantage. 

Farms and Farm-Honfes. The extent of the farms an: 

in general, from 50 to 100 acres. At a medium about 70. It is 
but of late that the landlords have begun to pay any attention 
to the farm houfes on their eftates. In general, however, a 
ftranger ftill views, with concern, the poor and mean-looking 
huts, in which the farmers are condemned to dwell, through- 
out all this country. Their habitation, and that of their cat- 
tle, are generally under the fame roof, and only feparated 
from one another by partitions. Scarcely any of them have 
an upper ftory, fo that the whole family are obliged to deep 
upon the ground, on a damp foil, where the floor is not fo 
much as paved with ftone or flags, and where there is not e- 
ven a fire place to draw off" the moift and ftagnant air. This 
muft be attended with the worft confequences to the health of 
the people ; whereas, were better and more comfortable houfes 
provided for the tenants, it would be a great inducement to them 
to pay betterments for their farms, and it would even be a means of 
enabling them to do fo, by giving them greater fecurity for their 
health, and rendering them better able attend to their bufinefs. 
Every houfe, therefore, ought to have as much of it raifed to a 
iecond ftory, as would furnilh the whole family with fufficient 
room to fleep above flairs, with vents in every fleeping apart- 
ment, in which fires might be put, occasionally, and, which, at 
any rate, would acl as ventilators, and, by keeping up the circu- 
lation of frefh air, would render confumptive complaints, at 
prefent fo fatal, muft lefs frequent. 



Thatching with Straw and Mortar. — There is nothing that 
1 would

would be more defirable, than to difcover fome method of co- 
vering the roofs of farm-houfes, fo as to render them cheap 
and comfortable. A flate roof is too expenfive in many pares 
of the country, from the difficulty of getting either the tim- 
ber, or the flate. Tile roofs do not laft, and common thatch- 
ing is of very fhort duration, is more liable to the danger of 
lire, affords fhelter and encouragement to vermin, and is ve- 
ry apt to be deftroyed by violent winds. But there is a mode 
of thatching with draw and mortar, introduced into the neigh- 
bourhood of Kilmarnock, about 22 years ago, in confequence 
of areceipt given by the late Mr Macdowalof Garthland, which 
»s, in many refpe&amp;s, preferable to every other, for the nor- 
thern parts of the ifland. The thatching is carried on in 

the ufual manner; only mortar, very well prepared, and mix- 
ed with cut ftraw, is thinly fpread over the ftrata of thatch, 
with a large trowel made for the purpofe. One expert thatch- 
er will require two men to ferve him with ftraw, one to pre- 
pare the mortar, and a fourth to carry it up. If the work is 
properly done, it will make a covering which will laft 40 or 50 
years ; and, when it begins to fail, it can eafdy be repaired. 
Sometimes clay is ufed inftead of mortar, and anfwers nearly 
as well. As it makes a moft excellent roof, the timbers ought 
to be good, and the fpars ftraight, and neatly put on, that 
there may be no heights and hollows in it. Such a roof will 
Hand in the moft expofed fituation, againft the moft violent 
winds ; gives no fhelter to vermin ; is not near fo much in 
danger of fire ; and though a little more expmfive at firft than 
the common thatch, yet does much more than compenfate for 
that circumftance, by its being fo extremely durable.

try, except about gentlemens houfes. It is commonly reck- 
oned not to be for the intereft of the proprietor topiant fore ft

timber, where land can be let for 1 8s or 2osper acre. But though 
this may be the cafe with refpeel; to the planting of large fields 
of arable ground, yet hedge-rows, or belts of planting, are 
well worth their room, from the fhelter that they afford ; and 
there are in every farm, even in the beft cultivated grounds, ma- 
ny fpots which the plow cannot reach, which, with a little at- 
tention and expence, might be planted, to the great ornament 
of the country, and to the great advantage of all concerned. 
Wherever fuch fpots are to be found, they ought to be inclo- 
fed and planted by the proprietors, and the care of them in- 
trufted to the tenant, who fliould be allowed to deduct yearly 
from his rent, (if the trees are properly taken care of) a cer- 
tain fum according to the extent of the ground planted, and 
the rent paid for the farm. Befides, he ought to be permit- 
ted to make all fuch farm utenfils as he needed, from thefe 
fpots ; only taking care to replace them when cut down, if 
they were not of a fort that fprouted again from the root. — 
This would prove a very important acquifition to the tenant 
and, befides the benefit the ground would derive from the ad- 
ditional {belter, the proprietor would in time be more than 
compenfated, by the timber that would remain on his eftate af- 
ter all the demands of the farmer had been anfwered. 

There is another method by which a very important addi- 
tion might be made to the quantity of timber in the country. 
Every farm-houfe ought to have a large plot of ground, con- 
taining from one to two acres adjacent to it, for flacking the 
corn in winter, for grafs to any favourite milk cow, for a 
kitchen garden, &amp;c« It fliould be laid out on no uniform plan, 
but the figure of it varied every where, fo as to fuit the fitua- 
tion of the houfe, and the form of the fields around it. If any 
rivulet runs near the houfc, it fhould be carried up through 
it, for the conveniency of wafhing and bleaching, and of wa- 
tering the plot. But, what' is of ftill more importance, the 

draining? 



of Kilmarnock.

draining:; from the ftables and dunghill ihould be conducted 
over it •, by which means three or four rich crops of grafs 
would be raifed in a fiafon. Round this fpot, fome rows of 
trees fhould be planted, of fuch kinds as arc proper for farm 
utenfils, for covering the houfes, Sec. Should this be -done 
properly, the yard alone would fupply much more than ever 
the farm would need ; the tenant would always have timber 
at hand for all he wanted, and be at no farther expence but 
that of cutting down the trees, and making his utenfds ; by 
which means he might always have them good in their kinds, 
and in perfect order at very little expence ; the country would 
be highly beautified and adorned, while the tenant would af- 
ter all reap more benefit from the ground thus employed, than 
from any other part of the farm of equal extent. A few fruit 
trees might be planted in one of die corners of this plot, and 
would feldom fail, in fuch a fituation, to produce a valuable 

crop The foreft trees, which^are reckoned moft proper for 

general ufe, are the afh, the elm, the larix, and above all, the 
Huntington willow. From the top of one of thefe willows, 
when it comes to the fize of a tree, and has been formerly cut 
over, there may be cut again, once in 16 or 20 years, for 
country purpofes, as much as is equal in value to 8s or 10s. 
They grow rapidly in almoft all foils, and are peculiarly ex- 
cellent for the roofs of farm-houfes, thatched in the manner 
before defcribed. If they are allowed to grow to a fulficient 
age without being cut over, they make excellent houfehold 
furniture, take a fine poliih, are very light, and lafl long. 

If thefe plans weie generally followed, it would complete, 
in the fpace of a few years, the improved appearance of this 
part of the country, and add greatly to the comfort and hap- 
pinefs of its inhabitants. The plain of Cunninghame, of which 
this parifh makes a part, when viewed from the high grounds 
of Kyle, lies in the form of a large and beautiful amphitheatre,

above 20 miles in diameter, and is efteemed by all who have 
viewed it, as naturally one of the mod delightful vallies to be 
found in Great Britain. But the principal part of it being the 
property of feme great landlords, there are, of confequence, 
but few gentiemens houfes in it. It is, therefore, the more 
neceflary, that it fhould be ornamented with neat and good 
locking farm-houfes, and with a confiderable number of groves, 
and plantations of trees, in order to give it a thriving and pro- 

fpercus appearance. It is to be hoped, that this will foon 

bi . ght about-, and, perhaps, no objects are better intitled 
to the attention of a public-fpirited fociety, (could one be con- 
t the purpofe) than to encourage the planting of fo- 
reft timber, and to improve the accommodation of our huf- 
bandmen, who are juftly to be accounted not the leaft valu- 
able part of the community.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1020265">MACHLIN</name>. 

(COUNTY OF AYR.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Auld,</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

IN old deeds, the name of Machlein, or Machlene is ufcd, 
but of late it is more commonly fpelled Machlin. It is 
derived, as fome imagine, from the Gaelic, and fignifies in 
that language, a field of flax. It is fituated in the prefbytery, 
fynod, and county of Ayr. It is about 7, miles in length, 
and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth. It was a priory or cell, 
belonging to the Abbacy of Melrofe : and when that Abbacy 
was erected into a temporal lordlhip, the lands and barony 
of Kylefmure, and Barmure, and the patronage of the church 
of Machlin, were given to the Lord of Loudoun. From the 
town ot parifh, the eldeft fon of that noble family takes his ti- 
tle to this day. 

Surface and Soil The parifh is in general flat, except' 

ing Machlin-hill, which rifes a little to the north-eaft of the 
town, and runs in a ridge, from eaft to weft, about a mile in 
I the parifh, terminating at Schioch-hill, in Tarbolton. From 
; the hill there is a very extenfive" profpecr, not only over a

great part of Ayrfhire, but 2s far as Cairnfmure, and other 
hills in Galloway, and Benlomond, Jura, Arran, Kintyre, 

3cc. The town of Machlin is fituated on the fouth fide of 

this rifing ground, which gradually declines towards the river 
Ayr, on the fouth and fouth- weft. About 80 years ago, the 
town had a charter, which is now loft, and with it, the right 
of chufing magiftrates. This is much to be regretted, as that 
privilege, if properly exercifed, might contribute much to the 
public good, by checking riots and difcrders, which are at pre- 
fent too frequent, and promoting the, good order, peace, and 
happinefs of the community. 

The foil in the parilh, is, for the moft part, of a clayifii na- 
ture, except fome fields, about Machlin, which are of a light 
fandy, or mixt kind. Hence, the fame weather does not 
fuit both ; and, when there is a good crop on the one, there 
is a light or bad crop on the other. — The whole of this parilh 
is arable, except two fmall moiles, and fome declivities on the 
banks of the Ayr, fit for planting. A large tract of land, 
called Machlin-muir, has, of late years, been turned into ara- 
ble land, and properly inclofed and furrounded with belts of 
planting, by the late Sir. Thomas Miller. In general, all the 
lands or farms in the parilh, within thefe 40 or 50 years, have 
been inclofed and fcbdivided. 

Minerals, , — There is a good red Hone quarry, near 
Machlin town ; and another white ftone quarry called Deacon- 
bank, about 3 miles to the north- weft. This laft is much ef- 
teemed for its fine grain and colour. At Bridgend, about 2^ 
miles from Machlin, there is a coal-work, with a fire en- 
gine. At Killoch, there is a lime- ftone quarry and iron ftcne, 
both belonging to Mifs Scot. Lime-Hone alfo at Auchmillan, 
belonging to Sir William Miller. In, and on the confines of 
Machlin parifh, are various curious caves cut out of the folicl 

rock,

Poor. — The poors ftock in this parifh, is between L. So and 
L. 100. The number of poor families, or weekly penfioners, is 
about 30- The income from collections, mort-cloths, and 
fome feats in the church, L. 50. The annual expenditure 
L. 60 yearly, and fome years more ; but the difference is made 
up by an affeffment, unanimoufly agreed to by the heritors, at a 
meeting in 177 1; who, in order to prevent begging in the pa- 
rifh, affcffed themfelves in a fum, amounting to L. 22 : 10 : 10 
per annum, one half of which, however, is payable by the te- 
nants. This increafed the poors ftock at the time-, but as the fund 
is gradually decreasing, in confequence of the number and ne- 
ceffities of the poor, unlefs a new affeffment is made, it will 
not be poffible for the ordinary income to fupply the de- 
mands which are made upon it. It muft be obvious to every bo- 
dy, that according to the prefent mode, the burdenlof maintain- 
ing the poor, is moft unequally divided. It falls almoft en- 
tirely on tenants, tradefmen, fervants, and charitable perfons 
attending the church; while other people, however rich, 
particularly non-refiding heritors, whatever their income may 
be, contribute little or nothing to the charitable funds of the 
parifli. Hence there is, in general, ample ground for the com- 
mon obfervation, " that it is the poor in Scotland who maintain 
" the poor." It muft be confeffedat the fame time, that, it is ve- 
yy difficult forming a plan that would provide for the poor, with-

out encouraging in them either inattention, indolence, or 
wa'fte. 

It may be added, that fortherelief of diftreflcd brethren, there 
was a fociety eftablifhed in this place about ten years ago, cal- 
led Machlin. Friendly Satiety. The prefent allowance is two 
millings weekly to fuch as are unable to work, and 3s to fuch 
as are confined to bed. One guinea is paid at entry. Th^ 
prefent ltock is L. 300. 

Charatlcr, In fuch a number there mull be fome 

exceptions : but, in general, they are a fober induftrious peo- 
ple, charitably difpofed : Careful and even punctual in attend- 
ing the church on Sundays, and on facramental occafions-, 
and their practice in the main is agreeable to their pvofeffion. 
— The inhabitants are of a middle fize, from 5 feet, 4 inches, 
to 6 feet, 2 inches, and make a decent appearance, particular- 
ly at public meetings. It is a great difadvantage to them that 
no manufacture is carried on : But they are willing to encou- 
rage any plan that may tend to promote the improvement of a- 
griculturej commerce, and manufacture ; in all which they are 

making fome progrefs. The manner of living and drefs, 

is much altered from what it was about 50 years ago. At 
that period, and for fome time after, there were only two or 
three families in this parilh, who made ufe of tea daily, now 
it is done by, at leaft, one half of the parith, and almoft the 
whole ufe it occalion?lly. At that period, good two-penny, 
ftrong-ale,and home-lpiritswere in vogue: but now even people 
in the middling and lower Itations of life, deal much in foreign 
fpirits, rum-punch, and wine. In former times, the gentlemen 
of the county entered into a refolution to encourage the con- 
fumption of their own grain, and, for that purpofe, to drink 
no foreign fpirits : 'But, in confequence of the prevalence of 
fmuggling, and the heavy taxes laid on home-made li- 

Vol If. P quors,

quors, this patriotic refolution was either forgotten or abandon- 
ed. — As to drefs, about 50 years ago, there were few females 
who wore fcarlet or filks. But now, nothing is more com- 
mon, than filk caps and filk cloaks ; and women, in a mid- 
dling ftation, are as fine ao ladies of quality were formerly. 
The like change may be obferved in the drefs of the male fex, 
though, perhaps, not in the fame degree . 

School and Language. There is a public eftablifhed 

fchool in this parifh, with a falary of L. 10 yearly ; and there 
are two private fchools in the town, befides fome in the country. 
The Scots dialed!: is the language fpoken, but is gradually im- 
proving, and approaching nearer to the Englifh. 

Climate, &amp;c. — The air is milder and more temperate here, 
than towards the eaftern coaft of Scotland. It is rather wet, 
but not unhealthy. 

There are no difeafes peculiar to this parifli. Inoculation 
for the fmall pox is prattifed with fuccefs. As a means of bet- 
ter health r it were to be wiflied, that the clothing, and houfes 
of the lower fort, were more warm and comfortable. The 
contributing thereto would reflect great honour, and afford 
much real fatisfaction to the more opulent. The inhabi- 
tants of this parifh, are in general, addicted to exercife and 
temperance, two great fources of long life and good health. 
But death, againft whom there is no defence, is ever match- 
ing away fome of all ranks and ages, the rich and the poor, 
the young and the healthy, as well as the old and the difeafed. 
The people, however, in general, are long-lived. Among 
other inftances of longevity, the minifters might be adduced. 
The late incumbent, Mr Maitland, held the charge of Machlin 
for 44 years •, and the prefent incumbent was ordained about 
50 years ago, to wit, in April 1742. 

Church, 



of Machlin. 



Church, Manft, &amp;c. The manfe was built in 1730; 

and has fince been feveral times repaired. The church, it is 
believed, was built before the Reformation. The ftipend con- 
fifts partly of vidual, and partly of money, and, including 
the glebe, which meafures from 5 to 6 acres, may amount 
annually to about L. 100. The right of patronage is in the fa- 
mily of Loudoun. 

At the town-head of Machlin, on the green, there is a tomb- 
ilone, with engravings ; from which it appears, that in 1685, 
under the unhappy reign of James VII. of Scotland, five men 
were put to death there. Under their names, there are the 
following verfes in the language of thofe times : 

** Bloody Dumbarton, Douglafs, and Dundee, 

" Moved by the devil, and the Laird of Lee, 

" Dragg'd thefe five men to death with gun and fword, 

** Not fuffering them to pray, nor read God's word ; 

M Owning the work of God was all their crime j 

" The eighty-five was a faint-killing time." 

The hole where the gibbet was fixed is Hill vifible. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. There are two great turnpike 

roads which crofs one another at Machlin ; one from Ayr 
to Edinburgh, the other from Kilmarnock to Dumfries. 

The river Ayr runs through this parifh from eaft to 
weft about a mile fouth of Machlin. In its courfe, there are 
feveral great works carried on at prcfent ; to wit, an iron 

work at Muirkirk, and a cotton-mill at Cattrine Over 

this river, there are feveral ufeful bridges near Machlin, par- 
ticularly the new-bridge at Barlkimming ; built by the late 
Sir Thomas Miller. It excels all the bridges of the county In 
beauty and elegance, and is one the greateft curiofities to be

feen in it. The river Ayr in its courfe, efpecially through 

Machlin parifh, paffes between fteep rocks, from 30 to 4© 
feet high. How this paflage was formed, whether by art, or 
by the water gradually making a channel for itfelf, is a point 

which cannot now be afcertained The only loch in 

the parifh, called Loch-Brown, is about three miles north-well 
from Machlin. Wild ducks, g^efe, and fometimes fwans re- 
fort to it. It covers about 60 acres of ground ; and would 
have been drained may years ago, had it not been for the fake 

of two corn mills which it fupplies with water. There is 

no tradition of any battle in the parifh, except one at Mach- 
lin muir, between the kings party and the Covenanters, about 
the year 1647, when the former was defeated ; and their mi- 
litary cheft was found, it is faid, many years after, hidden in 

the ground. The antient parochial records of the parifh are 

now loft. Sometime before the Reformation, the Popifh cler- 
gy perceived their intereft declining, and their down-fall ap- 
proaching in the kingdom, to prepare for the worft, they fold 
their lands for ready money, in fmall parcels, and then depart- 
ed, carrying with them all their money and effects, and all the 
books and regifters belonging to this, and, it is believed, to 
other parifhes in the neighbourhood.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q638046">EAGLE SHAM</name>. 

(COUNTY OF RENFREW.) 
By the Rev. Mr. ALEXANDER DoBIE.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

BEFORE .the village was built, which gives its name t© 
this parifh, thtre were feveral woods in it, particularly 
one of great extent on the banks of the river, an Englilh mile 
fouth of the village. This wood, and the rocks in the neigh- 
bourhood, were much frequented by eagles ; and as they of- 
ten perched on the holm, or low ground, where afterwards 
the village was built, it was thence c dled Eaglefholm, or Ea- 
glefham. Others derive the name from Ecclefia-holm, or, 
the church in the hollow. 

Extent, Situation, and Surface. — —The parifh is about 5 
miles from eaft to weft, and 6 miles fron north to fouth. 
It is bounded on the eaft by Kilbride and Carmunnock, on 
the north by Mearns, on the weft by Fenwick, and on the 
fouth by Loudoun. It is fituated in the county of Renfrew, 
the prefbytery of Glafgow, and fynod of Glafgow and Ayr. 
The foil is various. The higher and weftern part of the di- 
ftri£l confifts partly of dry heath, and partly of deep mofs, 

with 



itS Statijlical Account 

with a number of fine green hills, and a great deal of natural 
meadow-ground mixed together. The tenants in this part of 
the parifh plow little : Their great dependance is on their 
(heep, and the rearing of black cattle. The lower part of the 
parifh lying along the banks of the Cart, and to the weft of 
that river is a light foil, above a rotten whin-ftone rock ; and, 
when allowed to reft for four years, it produces two excellent 
crops of corn, with a very flight manure of lime or dung. 
The tenants in that quarter plow only a fourth part of their 
arable ground ; and oats is the principal grain they raife. 
Their great dependance is on the milk, butter, and cheefe, 
which they fell at Glafgow. On this account, they keep few 
horfes, but a great number of cows, rather of the beft than of 
the largeft kind. In the beginning of winter, they feed them 
with oat-fodder j but in the latter end of winter, and till the 
pafture grafs fprings up, with hay, and a little corn, once a 
day. 

Climate and Difeafes. The parifh lies high, and enjoys 

a free air. In the moorifh part of it, the air is exceedingly 
fharp and cold, but in the lower part it is mild and temperate, 
efpecially when the wind is from the weft. The village of 
Eaglefham, which contains the one half of the whole inhabi- 
tants of the parifh, is built on ground, that is full of, and 
furrounded by, fprings; which renders the houfes damp, 

where pains are not taken to prevent it. Confumptions 

are not uncommon -, but moft of the deaths are occafioned by 
fevers. The fine air, and the excellent water in the parifh, 
make it, on the whole, exceedingly healthy : and thofe who 
are at a fmall expence' in raifing the floors of their houfes, and 
making drains, have very dry and comfortable dwellings. 
There are numerous inftances in this parifh, of perfons ar- 
riving at 80 years of age, and a many beyond it. —

The fmall-pox carry off great numbers of children : but there 
is no reconciling the minds of the lower ranks to inoculation. 
In 1786, a few children were inoculated, and it feemed to 
give pain to the people in general, that they came fo well and 
eafily through. The thoughts of bringing trouble on their 
children, as they call it, with their own hands» outweigh every 
argument that can be advanced in its favour. 

Rivers and Mineral Springs. — Several rivulets rife out of 
the muirs of Eaglefham, and fall into the river Cart, on the 
eaft fide of the parifh. This river takes its rife out of the 
muirs of Kilbride and Eaglefliam, about four miles fouth of 
the village of Eaglefham ; and in its courfe northwards, di- 
vides the counties of Lancrk and Renfrew, and this parifh 

from Kilbride and Carmunnock There are two mineral 

fprings in the parifh ; the one is of a purgative quality, and 
when ufed in the cafe of complaints in the ftomach, gives im- 
mediate relief. The other is ufed as a remedy for the muir- 
ill in black cattle, and is carried to a great diftance for that 

purpofe. At Balegich-hill, two miles weft of the village, 

there have been lately obferved, feveral pieces of the barytes, or 
heavy ftone. It is of a reddifh colour, and laminated ftruc- 
ture j and is often the matrix of lead. This circumftance, 
joined with other fymptoms, render it probable, that there are 

filver and lead in that part of the parifh There are alfo 

found large mafles of the ofmund ftone, which feems to be a 
volcanic production. It ftands the ftrongeft heat without 
renting, for which reafon it is ufed in building ovens and 0- 
ther furnaces. 

Number of Proprietors, Farmers, and Inhabitants. — The Eai 1 
of Eglinton is patron and proprietor of the whole parifh, except 
three fmall farms in it. The valued rent is L. 3070 :6 : 8, 

and 



1-20 



Statijlical Account 



and the real rent about L. 2700 fterling. The Eglinton fami-* 
ly do not refide ; but the other three heritors poffefs their own 
farms, on which they live comfortably. The number of te- 
nants is greatly diminifhed, within thefe twenty years, by the 
junction of farms. At prefent there are only 63, without in- 
cluding thofe who take the parks adjacent to the village. The 
principal tenants pay L. 80, L. 90, and feveral above L. 100 
yearly rent. The lands in general let at 1 6s or 20s per acre, 

but thofe near the village at above 30s The number of 

people from fix years old or upwards, is 700, and there are 
about 300 under that age. The return to Dr. Webfler of the 
population of Eagkfham, was 1103 fouls, confequently the 
decreafe may be about 100. The baptifms, including thofe of 
the Seceders, are, at an average, about 25, the marriages 
about 9 or 10, but no regifter of deaths has been kept. 

Antiquities, Church, £sV.— Upon the banks of the Cart, a 
fcw miles from its fource, there is ftill {landing a part of the 

walls of the caftle of Punoon orPoinon —Sir John Montgo- 

merie of Eagle fham, at the battle of Otterburn, in 1388, 
took Henry Piercy (the famous Hotfpur) prifoner, with his 
own hand, and with the ranfom oxpvind ?noney, built that caf- 
tle, whence its name is derived Eaglefham is the moft 

antient poffeffion of the Montgomeries, a family of more than 
fix hundred years {landing. The church and village lie about 
a mile from this antient fabric. An old Popifh chapel, a ve- 
ry diminutive place, was ufed for public worfhip, till within 
thefe two years ; when Lord Eglinton, much to his honour, 
t reeled a moft elegant church, of an octagonal form, and fit- 
ted it up in the belt manner. The village of Eaglefham is al- 
lowed by every traveller who has feen it to be one of the mofr

nobleman of the fined tafte. It confifts of two rows of houfes 
oppofite to, and diftant from each other thirty-two falls, (a- 
bout 200 yards). Down the middle of that fpace runs a fmall 
rivulet, to which there is a gentle defcent from each row. 
The village is two furlongs and thirty falls long ; and the 
whole area on each fide of the rivulet confifts of grafs, for the 
ufe of the inhabitants. There they may bleach their linen, 
Szc. &amp;c. but no cattle are allowed to graze or tread on it. A 
number of fine trees planted along both fides of the rivulet, 
adds to the beauty of the fcene. Towards the higher end of 
village, on the rivulet, a large cotton work is juft now erect- 
ing. 

Stipend, School, &amp;c. — The ftipend is L. 79 : 3 : 4 fterling, and 
forty bolls of meal, with a glebe of 7^ acres, Englifli meafure. 
The Manfe has been in ruins for a number of years ; during 
which time, an excellent houfe has been hired for the mini- 
fter's accommodation. 

The encouragement for a fchoolmafter is better than in 
moft country parifties. The falary is L. 100 Scots (L. 8 : 6 : 8 
fterling), and the number of fcholars through the year may be 
rated at 60, or upwards. An excellent fchool houfe, with accom- 
modationsforthe matter, is juftnow' ; finifhing: Hehas alfo a good 
garden, and the other common emoluments. The whole will 
amount to about L. 30 fterling per annum. 

Divlfion of the Inhabitants.'— -In the country part of the pa- 
rifh, the farmers themfelves, with their wives and children, 
do the farmer and dairy work, with very little additional af- 
fiftance. In the 63 farms in the parifii, there are not above 40 
male, and 63 female fervants, except in hay time and harveft, 
when a few labourers and cottagers are hired occafionally. The 
trades people live all in the village. A few years ago, there 

Vol. II. were

were 63 filk looms at work there, but at prefcnt there ire on- 
ly 33, and thefe are moftly employed in weaving cotton of dif- 
ferent fabrics; the materials of which are furnifhed bythe Glas- 
gow and PaHley manufacturers. There are 4 joiners, 2 fmiths, 
4 fhoemakers, 5 taylors, 3 coopers, 8 day-labourers, 2 horfe- 
dealers, 1 baker, 8 public houfe-keepers, (but only two of thefc 
have (tabling for horfes). Thefe.houfes have here, as well as in 
other places, very bad effects. Surgeons, at different times, 
have attempted to fettle at Eaglefham ; but made no ftay on ac- 
count of wanting employment : And there are places, at no 
great diftance, from which, when neceftary, they are eafily 
had. — The hire of women-fervants for the half year, is from 
L. 1:15 to L. 2:5, and of men-fervants, from L. 3:10 to 
L. 4:10. The hire of a day-labourer is is. in winter, and 
1 5 d. in fummc*. 

; There are a few Cameronians, 40 Antiburghers, who at- 
tend public worfhip at a meeting-houfe in the parifh of 
Mearns. Befides the minifter of the Eftablifhed Church, 
there is one of the Burgher communion. About 60 of the 
parifhioners are his hearers ; the reft of his congregation 
come from the neighbouring parifhes. 

Morals , Poor, C5V. The people in general are very in* 

duflrious : There are few in the parifh in affluent circum- 
ftances, but they fupport themfelves and families in a com- 
fortable manner. At church, and other public occafions, 
they are clean and decent. No parifh has fewer real poor. 
The charity-roll is feldom above 7; though there are fome fami- 
lies that require a little affiftance, if the funds could afford it. 
But the heritors and inhabitants are averfe to any affeffment* 
and there are no mortifications. The collections amount to 

about L. 16. fterling per annum. The morals of the 

people arc, according to the beft information, ftrider now 

than 



vf Eaglcjham. 11$ 

than they were in former times. This may be partly attribu- 
ted to the greater expence of living, andtheadvance of the rents; 
as labour and induflry are among the heft preventatives of vice. 
Public ordinances are regularly attended : and there has not 
been, in the memory of man, a fingle inftance of any perfon 
belonging to this parWh, being either banilhed or capitally con- 
demned. 

Hor/es, Sheep , and Block Cattle. Through inoft of the 

year, there are not above 120 horfes in the whole parifli. 
The farmers begin to plow about the beginning of March ; 
and a great many of them join, two and two, to make out a 
plough ; which, in the language of the country, is called mar- 
roivitig. Thofe who have much plowing to execute, buy 
what horfes they want, at the beginning of the working feafon, 
■and fell them again when the labour is over. The number of 
milch-cows is about 756. Butbefides tc h©*fes fit for ! 8 Our, 
and the cows that give Milk, there are many young horfes and 
cows reared, efpecially in the moorilh part of it. There are 
upwards of 4000 old Cheep in the parifli, befides a proportion- 
able number of young ones. 

Advantages and D if advantages. — Between Eaglefham and 
Glafgow (about 9 miles diftance) there is a turnpike road, by 
which the farmers carry what they have to fell, in carts or 
waggons. A turnpike road from Ayr to Edinburgh palfes 
through this village, by Hamilton, which is fhorter by fx milcn 
than by Glafgow, and will be finifhedthis year. A turnpike is al- 
fo propofed to be made from Muirkirk, through this village, to 
Glafgow. It may likewife be confidered as an advantage 
which the villagers enjoy, that they have their houfes for nine 
hundred years, at no higher an annual than 3d fterling a fall; 
and each houfe has a rood of ground for a garden. They have 
2 befides,

befides, among them, 100 acres of muir, for which they pay 
nothing •, the greater part of which is capable of being im- 
proved into good arable ground. The difadvantages of this 

.parifh are, firft, its diftance from Glafgow, which is its mar- 
ket-town- Another, is the expence of fuel ; no good coal be- 
ing nearer than 7 miles, and no peats within lefs than two miles 
and a half. But the greateft difadvantage is the want a good po- 
lice. There is no magiflrate nearer than within 4 miles ; and 
the place is opprefled wich gangs of gypfies, commonly called 
tinkers, or randy-beggars, becaufe there is nobody to take the 
fmallefl account of them. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations Balagicb, Dunwar, Mires, 

Blackwood, and Mellawher, are remarkable hills. The firft 
two are nearly of the fame height ; and their fummits are 1000 

feet above the level of the fea. The inhabitants are under 

no fervitudc to the landlords; and in general pay nothing more 
than their money-rent, cefs and road-money ; fome few ex- 
cepted, who are bound by their leafes, to perform one or two 
days work yearly to the landlord, which is feldom exacted. — 
The farms, in the iQwer part of the parifh, are all inclofed. 
and great benefit is derived from it.

name is affumed from a famous abbey in the parifh, which

Situation, Extent, and Surface. — This parifh, lying in the

Air, Climate, and Difeafes. — The air in general is clear; 
but from the vicinity of the Atlantic, and the high hills which 
intercept the clouds and attract the vapours, this parifh and 
the neighbourhood experience frequent ftorms of wind, and 
heavy falls of rain ; but the latter is foon abforbed, and the 
vapours diflipated, the foil in the lower divifion lying on a 
fandy or gravelly bottom, with many declivities. The froft 
is very intenfe, and fnow does not lie long upon the ground. 
The climate is remarkably healthy, infomuch that invalids re- 
fort to Newabbey in the fummer feafon for the benefit of the 
fine air, goat's whey, and fea-bathing. There are no diftempers 
that can be called local, only the rheumatifm prevails much. 
The former virulence and ravages of the fmall-pox are much a- 
bated in this and the neighbouring parifh of Kirkgunzion, ow- 
ing to the minifters performing the operation of inoculation to 
a confiderable extent, and with the greateft fuccefs, among 
their refpective parifhioners *. 

Soil. — The foil in the Jower divifion of the parifh is moftly 
a light brown loam, which grows blackifh in proportion as it 
is richly manured, .and deepens by liming. The loam, from 
4 to 10 inches in depth, lies on a fine dry gravel: fome fields on

* Here humanity fuggefts the remark, that if other minifters 
would take the trouble to perform this very fimple operation ia 
their respective parifhes, it would contribute te make the practice 
general ; which will hardly be the cafe, while the common people 
confider it as a chirurgical bufinefs, and find it attended with ex- 
pence. It is to be believed, that a plan is now in agitation, for in- 
ftructing the ftudents of divinity at the Univerfity of Edinburgh 
in the art of inoculation, which the phyficians of that city ge- 
neroufly and humanely propofe to do without putting them to any 
cxpencc.

the fhore arc of a deep coarfe foil, on a dry bottom, and ard 
very produ&amp;ive. In the upper divifion, among the hills, the 
foil lies on a bed of wet, cold, tenacious till ; and the harveft 
is therefore later ; but, when the ground is well manured, ef- 
pecially in dry feafons, it produces good crops, though infe- 
rior both in quantity and quality to the former. 

Rivers and Lakes. — The river Nith wafhes the eaft border 
of the parifli for 2 miles, or thereby, and may be about that 
fpace in breadth when the tide is in ; the water riling 15 or 
16 feet in fpring tides, and making frequent incroachments 
upon the fhore ; though there are evident proofs th.it the land 
has, on the whole, gained confiderably. Veflcls of 60 or 70 
tons burden come up a burn in the parilh, called Newabbey- 
Pow, importing lime and fhells for manure, and a few coals, 
and exporting oats, oat-meal, barley, potatoes, and charcoal 
for England and Greenock. There are three lakes in the pa- 
rilh ; Lochkindar i£ mile long, and £ of a mile broad, a- 
bounding with trouts, and producing bull-ruihes and reeds ; 
the firft gathered by chair-makers, and the laft by the weavers. 
Lochend and Craigend lakes are each about £ of a mile long, 
and t a mile broad ; they abound with pike, confequently 
have few or no trout in them. 

Mountains. — The S. and S. W. boundary of this parifli is a 
chain of hills, beginning on the S. W. with Lowtis, and end- 
ing on the S. and S. E. with Criffell, both fteep, high, and rocky 
eminences. CrifFell, in particular, has a grand appearance, rifing 
about 2000 feet above the level of the fea, from whence it is 
a mile diftant. On the fummit there is a perennial fpring of 
very fine water ; near which is a large heap of (tones, called 
Douglafs cairn, probably from Douglafs, Earl of Morton, 
who, when he wag Lord of the marches, had a cattle called 

Wreaths 



Statifticai Account 



Wreaths at the foot of this hill. The foil of Criffell is in gene- 
ral good green pafture, efpecially on the N. and N. E„ 
Cdes. It is vifible at a great diftance ; and the country peo- 
ple who live within fight of its fummit are accuftomed to con- 
fult it as a fure weather-glafs. 

State of Property. — Several people now living have feen the 
whole parifh, (one moderate eftate excepted) in other families 
than thofe of the prefent heritors ; fome eftates have had three 
different proprietors within the laft 20 years, and I of the pa- 
rifh have changed owners in that period. But this is not like- 
ly often to be the cafe in time-coming ; and one of the beft 
eftates in the parifh has been lately entailed. The heritors 
are 20 in number, but only one of any confiderable property 
refides. 

Mule of Cultivation. — In the lower divifion of the parifh, 
a mode of cultivating the ground, introduced about 20 years 
ago, by Mr Craik of Ardbigland, has been found by experience 
to anfwer particularly well, efpecially when the land is inclof- 
ed, and is as follows: Each farm is divided into nine parts; one 
divifion of the oldeft ley in the farm, is the firft year limed 
with 50 or 60 Dumfries meafures of unflacked lime, each mea- 
fure cofting od. or (j{A. and containing about 2| Winchefter 
bufhels : this divifion is in fpring ploughed up, and fown with 
oats, at the rate of 8 or 9 Winchefter bufhels to the acre. 
Next year a fecond crop of oats is taken ; the third crop muft 
be a green crop, or open fallow ; the former may be peafe 
and beans, turnips, or potatoes, but the laft is generally pre- 
ferred, and they are planted in drills, from 3 to feet afun- 
der, and well dunged. The fourth crop is barley or wheat, 
with which 1 2 or 14 lb. of red clover, 2 Winchefter bufhels of 
vye-grafs, and fometimes 6 lb. of white clover-feed, muft be 
1 fown 



qf Newabbey. 129 

&amp;vra on each acre. The fifth crop, and fomctimes the fixth 
is cut for hay; and the field is afterwards ufed for pafture, 
till its turn of being broken up for oats in the tenth year re- 
turns 5 then it is limed with fomewhat more than half the firft 
quantity of lime, and the former rotation of crops is followed. 
By this mode of cultivation, a farm of 9 divifions will thus lie 
in crop, year ift and 2d oats, 3d potatoes, &amp;cc. 4th barley, or 
wheat, 5th hay, 6th hay or pafture, 7th, 8th, and 9th pafture. 
This courfe is pretty ftrictly followed in the lower divifion, 
confifting of about 1600 acres; and, it is kept in view, as 
much as the nature of the foil will admit, in the upper part of 
the parifh, in which there may be 400 acres arable; 150 of 
which are ufually in oats and barley, and the remainder in hay 
or pafture. 

Implements of Hujbandry. — About 52 ploughs are employed 
in agriculture, moftly of the true Scots conftruction, and a few 
of the Englifh form. They are generally drawn by two horfes , 
but in {tiff and fteep foils, three horfes a-breaft are yoked to 
each plough ; in both cafes the ploughman drives the horfes. 
There are from 75 to 80 carts in the parifh; a great number, 
in proportion to the ploughs, owing to an improvement lately 
introduced, of ufing light fingle horfe-carts, in place of the 
large heavy double carts, which were formerly in ufe. 

Seed-time and Harvejl. — Wheat is fown from the ift of 
Odober to the middle of November, and reaped from the 
middle of Auguft to the ift of September. Barley is fown af- 
ter the 10th of April, and reaped at the fame time, with the 
wheat. Oats fown from the 1 ft of March, and reaped in 
September. Potatoes are planted in April and early in May, 
and dug up after the ift of October.

This produce not only abundantly fupplies the parifh, but 
affords fales at home, and exportation abroad, to a confidera- 
ble amount, particularly of wheat, oats, barley, and potatoes to 
England, and of wheat and oat-meal to Greenock. Importation 
of victual is extremely rare, or rather unknown here. Very 
few peafe are raifed, as they pay next to nothing in this 
foil and climate ; and very little hemp and flax are fown. 
The culture of turnips is almoft wholly fuperfeded by potatoes, 
which yield, if not a larger, yet a quicker return than the 
former, as there is a fulhcient demand for all that can be 
raifed here; the greateft part of which is exported to Briftol, 
Liverpool, and fometimes to Dublin. The price is from I2d« 
to 2od. per cwt. which brings good profit to the farmer. Un- 
der this head, it may be ftated, that great abundance of capil- 
laire, (vulgarly maiden hair) grows in the crevices of the de- 
caying walls of. Newabbey, and its precincts. This plant is 
much ufed In afthmatic complaints, by drying it in the fun, 
then infufing it in water, and drinking it as tea ; alfo by in- 
fufing

fufing it in its green ftate in water, for a day or two, ftrain» 
ing the liquor, and boiling it up with fugar-candy into a fyrup 
for ufe. Good effects have been often experienced from the 
ufe of this plant, efpecially when prepared as a fyrup. 

Rent. — The rent of the parifh may be nearly L. 2000 for 
the land, L. 45 for the mill and fifliings, and L. 55 for houfes 
and gardens, in all L. 2 1 00. The general rent of the largeft 
farms, is, from L.40 to L.70 a year, only two are above L, 100, 
none above L. 150 : Many perfons occupy fmall portions of 
land of L. 10 rent and under; fo that the land is very bene- 
ficially divided, none pofleffing too much, and numbers having 
a little. 

Prices cf Provifwns and Labour. The Dumfries market 

regulates the price of every article of provifion here ; only the 
oats and oat-meal of this parifh are (hipped for exportation, at 
a rate fomething below that market price. A (kilful able 
man-fervant in the houfe earns yearly from L.7 to L. 8, befides 
his victuals, which may be about L. 5 more — a houfe wo- 
man-fervant from L. 3 to L. 3 : 10. A married man-fcrvant, 
hired by the year, commonly called a benefit-man, has a 
houfe and yard, a cow kept, his potatoes fet, his peats caft 
and led, with fo much meal, barky, and money, as may 
amount in the whole, to L. 12, L. 15, or even L. 16 a 
year-, which, with his wife's induftry, and that of the older 
children, keeps his family in the neceflarks of life, and enables 
him to give his children a tolerable education. A day labour- 
er earns is. a day, for nine months in the year, and iod. a 
day for three months in the middle of winter ; but, if the 
victuals are furniflied by the employer, thefe wages are 4d. a 
day lefs. An able and (kilful labourer, who takes jobs by the 
piece, fuch as ditches, drains, and (tone-dykes, will, by hard

labour, and" extra hours, earn 15c!. and even i8d. a day m 
fummer. A woman working at hay, weeding, &amp;c. earns 
4d. a day, with victuals, or yd. without them; at carrying 
peats, and reaping in the harveft, 8d. in the former cafe, and 
1 3 in the latter, is the common wages for that fex. Spinning 
yarn, or factory-yarn, as it is called, employs many women, 
efpeciallyin winter and fpring; but they make forry wages of 
it, not above 3d. per day ; — which can afford very fcanty food, 
when firing, and often houfe-rent, is fuperadded. Taylors 
earn 6d. fome few 8 d. a day, with victuals  — mafons charge 
2od. and joiners i6d. a day, without victuals. 

Benefit-men, mentioned above, are now much lefs employ- 
ed than formerly, fo that there arc not above 3 now in the 
parifh, as the farmers find their account in preferring houfe- 
fervants, becaufe the latter are always at hand, under few- 
er temptations to difhonefty, and coft L. 2 or L. 3 a year lefs 
than the other. Unlefs villages, however, are fcattered up 
and down the country, where the farmer can find day or job 
labourers to execute his extra work at hay, peats, harveft, 
&amp;c either benefit-men, or fupernumerary fervants will be 
neceflary, nor will it always be poffible to procure them. Col- 
lecting people into villages, therefore, cannot be too much 
encouraged. 

Flperies. — The fifh in the river Nith at this place are falmon, 
flounders, and a few fmall cod and whitings. The quantity 
of falmon caught is very triffling, and is far from recompenfing 
the time confumed in that employment ; fo that now it is but 
little followed *. The flounders are found in great abundance, 

and

and of the beft quality, and are in feafon from July to Janu- 
ary. Lochkindar abounds with large and fine trout, (fome 
few weighing 2o or 24 ounces ;) and is much refbrted to 
by anglers from Dumfries, who reckon a dozen a good day's 
filhing, as the trouts are very fhy. 

Ale-bottfef ami Village. — There are only two ale-houfes in 
this parilh, botli in the village of Newabbey ; through which 
a public road pa Acs, and they are more frequented by ftrangers 
than by the parifhioners, whofe morals are in no degree hurt by 
them. Newabbey is a pleafant village of 5ohoufes, adjoining 
to the ruins of the abbey that gives name to it; well 
fupplied with fine water, and furrounded with beautiful 
woods. 

Stipend, Church, tzfe. The ftipend, a3 augmented in 

1 77 1, is L. 83 : 6 : 8, and L. 3 : 6 : 8 more for communion e- 
Jements. The glebe confifts of 10^ acres; 4 acres wheieof. 
lie within the precincts of the abbey, and the other 6|- are 
adjacent to the old parochial church, at Lochkindar, at a very 
inconvenient diflance from the manfe : but both parcels are 
of an excellent foil, and worth, at leaft, a guinea per acre. 
The prefent church, which is contiguous to the ruins of the 
abbey, was built in 1 731. Some remains of the antient parochi- 
al church are ft ill to be feen in the illand of Lochkindar. ■

fent, and that their numbers have been gradually decfeafing. 
The number of poor now on the roll, does not- exceed 10 or 
1 2 ; for whofe relief the weekly collections amounting to 
L.o,— the rentof a fmall farm purchafed with a mortification, 
L.i 2, — and the intereft of fome late mortifications (L.150, at 
4 per cent.) L. 6,— total L. 27 a year, are quite fufficient. Not 
a fingle pauper, in this pariih, has left his houfe to beg, thefe 
30 years ; but vagrants and beggars from otter parifhes are of- 
ten met with. 

School. — There is a parochial fchool, at which the number 
of fcholars, has, for many years paft, been, at an average, 
50 at leaft, the falary is L. 15, with a comfortable dwelling- 
houfe; the wages and perquifites may amount to from L. 15 or 
L. 2 1 more. Befides this, there are two little fchools with trif- 
Sing falaries, one at each extremity of the parifh. 

Population The population, on the whole, is rather on 

the increafe. From 1730, to 1760, the yearly average of 
baptifms, entered in the regifter, is 15 -, from 1760, to 1770, 
16; and, from 1770, to 1790, 18. 

Though this and other circumftances, in particular, the great 
difference betiveen the births and deaths, the one being in 
proportion to the other as 25 to 11), fully prove an increafed 
population; vet old people, when converfed with upon thefub- 
jefr, uniformly maintain a contrary idea, grounding their opi- 
nion, on the union of many fmall farms into one, on the veftiges 
uf ploughed land, at prefent neglected, and the remnants of 
houfes and cottages, now in ruins. To thefe obfervations, 
however, the anfwer is eafy. The fervants, labourers, and 
cottagers required on a large farm, will equal the population

There has been little or no- emigration from the parifh, 
within the iaft 20 years, excepting a very few ill-advifed peo- 
ple, both married and fmgle, who went to St. John's, in

North America, and, in the ifiue, had abundant reafon to re* 
pent leaving their native country. 

Number cf Cattle, tfft:.. The upper or hilly divifion ol? 

the parifh is applied chiefly to pafture for fheep and black cattle; 
of the former there may be about 3500, and of the latter iooq. 
Thefe are of the true Galloway breed, were formerly of a 
fmall fize, but are much improved of late years, by paying 
greater attention to the fize and fhape both of the bulls and 
cows. The fheep are of the fhort fmall kind, but improving in 
fize. Their wool is not fine, nor are their fleeces large ; they are: 
falved or fmeared with tar and butter j 8 fleeces, at an average^ 
go to the ftone of 24 lbs. avoirdupois, which has fold, for 10 
years part, from 4s. 6d. to 6s. The price of wool has been 
riling for the 3 laft years. The mutton, -when fat, and kept 
to four years old, is exceedingly nice, of a rich red juice, and 
fine flavour, and may then weigh 10 or 1 1 lb. per quarter, and 
will yield from 4 to 6 lb. of 24 oz. of tallow. But the hills of 
this parifh produce very little good, fat, and old mutton, fince the 
farmer has found it more to his advantage to feed his fheep bet« 
ter, and to fell them young. The number of work-horfes is about 
130, and of young horfes 30. They are greatly improved of 
late, by paying attention to their breed, and are very hardy* 
and fit for labour. 

Minerals and Fuel. Criffell affords plenty of granite ; 

exceedingly fit for building, both in point of ftrength and 
beauty. There are fome appearances of coal in the lower end of 
the parifh ; and a flight trial to find it was made a few years 
ago, but without fuccefs.— -The fuel made ufe of is in ge- 
neral peat j but mofs is not plenty, and moitly the property 
of one heritor j whofe tenants alone have the liberty of mak-

for it. The leading cofts the poor people dear ; no lefs in re* 
turn than a day's reaping in harveft, equal to 8d. for each' 
eartfull. Ten of thefe cartfulls fuffice for a labourer's family, 
and that quantity may be call by one man in one day. 
Dry broom, furze, and branches of decayed fir-trees, aid the 
fcanty quantity of peats to many, and wholly fupply their 
place to fome. A few families ufe a little coal, which is im- 
ported from England, at the price of about 4^-d. per Winchef- 
ter bufhel, or id. per ftone avoirdupois. There is lime- ft one 
in the parifh, though in no great quantity ; and, from the 
icarcity of fuel, no attempt has been made to burn it. 

Antiquities. — The principal monument of antiquity in the 
parifh, is a famous Ciftertian abbey, founded by Devorgilla, 
daughter of Allan, Lord of Galloway, wife to John Baliol, 
Lord of Caftle-Bernard, and mother of John Baliol, King of 
Scotland. It was firft called the Abbey of Sweet-heart, from 
the circumftance of her hufband's heart being embalmed, and 
inclofed in a box of ivory bound with fdver, which was built 
into the walls of the church : but that name was afterwards- 
changed into that of Newabbey. This ftru&amp;ure ftands in the 
middle of- a fine level field of about twenty acres, called the 
precinct, inclofed by a ftone wall 8 or 10 feet high, built of 
granite ftones of great fize, fome of them, even near the top 
of the wall, feem to be no lefs than a ton in weight. The 
abbey itfelf, which was erected towards the end of the twelfth, 
century, is a beautiful and lofty building, of the light Gothic 
itile of architecture; its church is 194 feet long, 102 feet 
broad at the crofs, and 66 feet at the ends, with a tower up- 
wards of 90 feet high. This place is frequently vifited by 
ftrangers ; and is particularly defcribed by Grofe and Cardon- 
nel, in their late publications on the antiquities of Scot- 
land. 



■of Newabbey. 139 

In Lochkindar there is an artificial mount of ftones, rifing 
6 or 7 feet above the furface of the water, fuppofed to have 
been conftructed for the purpofe of fccuring the mod valuable 
effects of the neighbouring families from the depredations of 
the borderers. The ftones ftand on a- frame of large oaks„ 
which is vifible when the weather is clear and calm. Sea- 
fowl breed here in fummer. 

Food of the People, cs°r. — The food of the poor, and of the 
labouring people is very indifferent in quality, though there is 
no deficiency in the quantity. Potatoes may here be fairly 
computed to conftitute more than half the food of the lower 
clafs of inhabitants, for full three quarters of the year. La- 
bourers and tradefmens wives are generally frugal and induf- 
trious ; their children thrive and grow up apace to be helpful 
to their parents, and ufeful to fociety, and generally get a to- 
lerable education for their ftation in life. 

Size and Characltr of the Feopi,; The inhabitants of 

Newabbey, are, in general, about the middle ftature, of 5 feet 
6 or 7 inches, healthy, acYive, and inured to labour. One 
young man, who lately removed from the parifii, was of the 
height of 6 feet 7 inches, of a make and ftrength proportional, 
and was remarkable for a quiet and peaceable temper. The 
genius and employment of the inhabitants turn to agriculture, 
in which they are very induftrious and judicious. They are a 
fober, obliging, honeft and intelligent fet of people, hofpita- 
ble to ftrangers, charitable to the poor, juft in their dealings, 
and obliging to one another. They affect not elegance or ex- 
pence in their drefs or diet, but are cleanly and comfortable 
in both, and are truly a fet of very worthy and refpedlable 
people. Very few incline to fea, and fewer ftill to the ar- 
my. To the credit of the parifh, it may be added, that not a

The means of bettering their fituation feem to be chiefly 
thefe, i. Taking high duty off Engltfh coals ; as much time, 
labour, and expenci are confumed in cutting, winning, 
and carting peat, which operates as a great difcouragement to

duce of his fields. Moft of the land? here pay Vt °f a N the

ler's dues of manufacturing, and they alfo pay T ' T of all grain 
fold. The particular hardfhip of this laft tax is, that it ex- 
tends to wheat, though the proprietor never has had a mill fit 
for grinding it. It is, however, but juftice to the prefent 
proprietor, to obferve, that an offer has lately been made to 
all the heritors of purchafing their refpedtive multures, at pri= 
Ces which do not feem to be unreafonable.

NUMBER XIII. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q747777">NIELSTON</name>. 

(COUNTY OF RENFREW.) 
By the Rev. Mr. John Monteath.</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

IT is generally fuppofed that the names of fuch parifhes, at 
leall in this part of the country, as end in the fyllables 

town or ton, are derived from proper names. Perhaps fome 

perfon of diftin&amp;ion, of the name of Niel, had either fixed 
his refidence here, or having fallen in battle near it, had a 
done ere&amp;edon his grave. Either circumftance might occafion 
the name of Niel's town, or Niel's ftone, being given to this 
diftricl: *. The latter, however, feems to be the prevailing, 

hut uncertain tradition. There were, it is well known, 

four 

* Nielfton was an antient pofleflion of the Crocs of that ilk, a 
family of great antiquity in this mire ; and this diftrift, with the 
lands of Crocftoun and Darnly, came afterwards, by marriage, to a 
younger brother of the illuftrious family of Stewart, of whom 
were defcended the Stewarts, promifcuoufly defigned of Crocftoun 
and Darnly, afterwards earls, and then dukes of Lennox.— —

four moor ftones of confiderable thicknefs, four feet and a 
half high, and placed four feet diftant from each other, which 
ynany have fuppofed, with great probability, to have been the 
monument of Niel. Thefe Rones were entirely demolished a- 
foout 30 years ago. 

Situation, Extent, and Surfcce. — This parifh is fituated in 
the (hire of Renfrew, prefbytery of Paifley, and provincial 
fynod of Glafgow and Ayr. Its extent is very confiderable. 
There was a map made of it many years ago, which, was 
lately inquired after, but without fuccefs. The form of the 
parifh is irregular, reaching about nine miles in length, from 
eaft to weft, and may be, on an average, three miles in 
breadth. Suppofing the above extent were perfectly accurate, 
and allowing 503 Scots acres in an Englifh fquare mile, it 

contains, 13,570 acres In the lower parts of the parifli, 

which is at the eaft end, the foil is various, and all kinds of 
grain common to Scotland are cultivated to advantage. But 
to the weft, the country gradually rifes, till it comes to a 
pretty high elev.ation. It is moftly of a light mould, and 
though much of it be tilled, yet it appears better calculated 

for pafturage The Faraneze and Lochlibo-fide hills, 

making one ridge, reaching from north- weft to fcuth-weftfor 
feveral miles, are covered with green, and contain a number 
of arable farms ; and, as the farm-houfes appear in a line 
along the fteep afcent *, they afford a beautiful profptcT: to

it has been a queftion, whether they ought to be plowed. In 
fome parts they get only one furrow taken, anj fiide back the

Jhe traveller. On the farther parts of the lands of Lochlibo, 
the foil is more barren, the furface covered with bent and 
heath, and partly with deep mofs ; which may, one day, be 
of great importance to the country, by furnifhing peats for fuelj 
when all the coal mines in the neighbourhood are exhaufted. 
Along this tracl of country, the traveller is delighted with a 
very pleafant and picturefque landfcape. On nearly the fame 
fpot, may be feen towards the fouth and weft, the beautiful 
and fertile plain' of Ayrfhire, wafhed by the firth of Clyde ; 
Ufa, a flupenduous rock, ftanding-alone,buffetted by the waves; 
Arran, with a number of other iflands interfperfed, in a channel 
covered with fhips ; Carrick hills, and feme mountains in Gal- 
loway towards the fouth-eaft, and the boundlefs expanfe of 
waters which joins the Atlantic ocean, towards the fouth. 
Towards the north and eaft, many of the moft pleafant, and 
romantic fcenes in Scotland, prefent themfelves to the view ; 
Lochlomond with feveral of her iflands; Benlomond with 
ins fhoulders covered with fnow, and his head enveloped with 
clouds; the plains of Renfrew and Lanerk; the city of Glaf- 
gow, with her numerous and lofty fpires ; and the profpecl: to- 
wards the eaft, terminated by the mountains beyond the 
Forth. Several plantations of firs, larix, beeches, and other 
foreft trees, have lately been made in the neighbourhood, 

winch will greatly add to the beauty of the fcene. The 

craig of Nielfton, in the fouth part of the parifh is the higheft 
in the diftritft, and the only high hill which Hands by itfelf, 
not forming a ridge or tract, of the country. It is vulgarly cal- 
led the Pad, from having in its appearance the form of a pil- 
lion. It is 820 feet above the flood mark, and yet is all green, 
and arable to the very top, though now only ufed for paf- 
ture.

extent and furface of this parifh, it is evident that the climate 
mult vary in different parts. It is often milder at the eaft end 
than in the centre, and milder there, than on the higher 
grounds towards the fouth and weft ; hence the farmers can 
often plow on the one, when they cannot, on account of the 
froft, on the other. During winter, the fields towards the 
eaft are often black, when thofe to the fouth and weft are 
covered with fnow. 

The original inhabitants, it is certain, were a healthy, ro- 
buft, and induflrious people, employed principally in agricul- 
ture. Many of them rather above the common fize. It 

was afferted by a late military gentleman of this neighbour- 
hood *, who was well informed, accurate in his obfervations, 
and who had opportunity, during many years of his life, 
whilft in his Majefty's fervice, to fee the fubjects of moft of 
the different powers, and fome of the fineft troops in Europe, 
that John Stewart of Moyne, the proprietor of a fmall eftate 
in the hilly part of the parifh, above the Craig of Nielfton, 
was for ftature, ftrength, exact proportion, and good looks, 
the completeft figure of a man, he had ever feen f . What ef- 
fects the luxury of modern times, and the fedentary employ- 
ment which are now fo prevalent, have had, and will have 
upon the ftrength and appearance of the people, may eafily be 
conjectured. 

Rivers and Lochs. There is fcarce a ftream in this pa- 
rifh that deferves the name of a river, though there are many 
rivulets, called, in the provincial dialect of the country, burns.

One of thefe, and the principal of them, is called Lavern-wa- 
ter, rifing in the high grounds in the fouth part of Nielfton, 
and running north-enft through the diftriet. Its ftream is na- 
turally fmall 5 but within thefe few years, fome companies 
concerned in the cotton-mill, the Faraneze print-field, and 
feveral bleachfields fituated along its banks, not without 
fome difficulty in fettling with a number of heritors, in this and 
the neighbouring parifh of Mearns, obtained a leafe, with liber- 
ty to get the fource of this water dammed up, with a breaft- work 
of about 16 feet high. The fprings above this being numerous, 
and the land level, a tract of country, of about a mile in 
length, and half a mile in breadth, called the Long-Locb t 
is overflowed, fo that, during the greateft drought in fum- 
mer, by drawing the fluice three inches, there is a plentiful 
fupply of water to drive all the machinery in the public works 
erected, and ft ill erecting on this ftream. This bafon, extend- 
ing along part of the march between Nielfton and Mearns, 
was formerly a loch, though, it is believed, not fo extenfive 
as at prefent, and had been drained many years ago by the 
furrounding proprietors, by which they obtained a confiderable 
tract of coarfe hay and pafturage. Some trout from Lavern 
have lately been put into it, where, it is expected, they will 
thrive exceedingly. When the prefent leafe expires, the a- 
bove companies muft make a new agreement with the pro- 
prietors *'", who, no doubt, are by this time, fully apprifed of 
its increafed value. 

There is another loch in the weft end of the parifh, called

and almoft every kind of foreft trees ; the property of Wil- 
liam Mure, Efq. of Caldwell, whofe manfion-houfe and plea- 
fure grounds in the parifli of Beith, are in the neighbour- 
hood. From Lochlibo, iffues, with an almoft impercepti- 
ble motion, the water of Lugton, meandering through a 
large meadow of near 100 acres, and running weftward 
through Ayr-fhire. At its fource, it is a fmall rivulet, but be- 
fore it reaches the plantations and pleafure-grounds of Eglin- 
ton, it increafes into a confiderable and rapid current. It is 
faid, that, at a confiderable expence, the waters of this loch 
might be brought eaftward through Nielfton to join the La- 
vern, about two miles diftance. There are feveral other ri- 
vulets in this parifli, which, from the vicinitude to the large 
manufacturing towns of Glafgow and Paifley, (the former be- 
ing only nine miles diftant), have become of great value to the 
proprietors ; all of them having their banks occupied with 
extenfive bleachfields, which, in Confequence of the excellent 
fprings in their neighbourhood, (the purity of whofe water is 
very great,) and the plenty of coals in this, and the adjoining 
parifli of Paifley, carry on a moft extenfive bufinefs in bleach- 
ing, but chiefly of light goods, as muflins, cambricks, lawns, 
&amp;c. 

Woods and Plantations. There are no natural woods of 

confequence in this, nor in the three adjacent parifhes on the 
fouth and weft, a want feverely felt by the inhabitants. There 
are, however, befides the plantations round Lochlibo, juft 
now mentioned, and fome on the heights of Lochlibo-fide *, a

which may, in time, fo far fupply the above want. The mod 
thriving appear to be thofe on the fides of Faraneze *j which 
may convince the neighbouring proprietors, whofe lands art- 
lower and better Iheltered, what may be done on their eftatea \. 

Coals, and Lhne-Jlone — Coals have formerly been wrought 
along the banks of the Lavern, about the middle of this parilh. 
There is juft now a coal pit working at the weft end of Loch- 
libo, with a fteam engine upon it, the property of William 
Mure, Efq. rented at L 60 per annum. There are coals alfo 
at the eaft end of the parifii, on the lands of Mr Cuthbertfon 
of Lyon-Crofs ; but, as the roads leading there are not made, 
and the ground is by nature a deep clay, he has only dug them 
for his own confumption. Lime-ftone is found in plenty in many 
parts of the parifii ; free-ftone both at the eaft and weft ends, 
ufed for building houfes. Moor-ftone alfo abounds, but 
there are no good quarries of it, the ftones being fo hard, that 
it is difficult to work them, or fo brittle in their texture, that 
they moulder down with the weather. Hence, building in 
the centre of the pariih is very expenfive %.

common in the weft of Scotland. The migrntory birdswhich ap* 
pear in the fpring, are in the following order of time; the lap- 
wing, or green plover, the curlew, the ftone-checker, vulgarly fo 
called, and laftly, the cuckow and fwallow. In the end of au- 
tumn the wood-cock and fieldfare appear. In fome ftatiftical 
accounts already publifhed, the wood lark is mentioned as mi- 
gratory ; but it is certain, that this delightful bird, which has 
been juftly called the nightingale of Scotland, may be feen e- 
very month in the year in fome of the woods in this country, 
and her plaintive notes heard during the greater part of the 

feafon. The plants are alfo fuch as are common to the 

weft part of the ifland. The mercurialis, anemone, primula, 
and hyacinthus, are the firft that appear on the banks and in 
the glens. 

Antiquities, Fcjftls, Isfc. — The principal remnant of antiqui- 
ty in the parifh, is a Danifh {lone with curious carved works 
upon it, which, it is faid, once flood on the lands of Hawk- 
head, but is now a humble bridge ftone over a fmall rivulet be- 
twixt thefe lands and Arthurlie. There are two tumuli, vul- 
garly called, cairn3, on the top of the Faraneze hills, one of 
them in particular is of confiderable bulk, and there is the 
foundation of a large dyke, or wall around it, (till difcerna- 
ble. A great quantity of ftones have been led away from ir, 
but nothing except a few fmall bones, whether human or not 
was uncertain, have yet been difcovered. Tradition reports 
that a battle was fought there. Several urns with bones in 
them, furrounded with fquare free- ftones, have been found in 
different parts of the parifh : alfo fome petrified fliells, and 

ftones with impreffions of trees on them. There arc alfo 

two places, where, it is faid, chapels flood before the Refor- 
mation, one a mile above, and the other a mile below the 
church ; but no veftige of their walls now appear. The for-

Population* —There arc difficulties In afcertaining the num- 
ber of people in this parifh, not known in parilhes mere re- 
mote, and lefs populous or commercial. When it is confider- 
ed, that there are two cotton miils creeled, ijuid two more c- 
recring, one large print field, and twelve bltachfields, the 
mode of precifely afcertaining the number ot : inhabitants for 
any given time beyond a few months, is but uncertain. At 
thefe fields, for example, there are a number of -women not hav- 
ing families, nor refiding in families, but in wuvnen-houfes, fo 
called, erecled on purpofe near almoft eve ry field, where 
they lodge only during the working featcn, repairing to the 
neighbouring towns during the winter iron ths, anci perhaps 
not returning again to the fame fields. This migratory clafs, 
in number about 03, lodge at prefent in feve n women-houfes, 
and are not included in the following lift, If it be thought 
proper to add them, it is ealily done, and the confequences 
are obvious. They will add their amount to the number of 
fouls in general, and to the article of fern ales in particular, 
ind overbalance the males, which would not otherwife be the 
cafe : they will alfo add their number to die article of thofe 
above 15 years of age; and to that of fetrvantsj with this 
difcrimination, that they are only emplo ycd in bleaching 
and drying goods. 

The following lift was taken up within ■•thefe few months,

Previous to the year 1783, there is a great chafm in the re- 
giftration of burials, and it is to be obferved, that many bury 
out of the bounds of the parifh, and the poor, who are exemp- 
ted from the tax, are not regiltered. 



Number of Proprietors, Tenants, &amp;fc. There are twenty 

heritors ; but none of the greater proprietors refide in the pa- 
rifh. There is but one refident juftice of the peace*; a 
circumftance to be regretted in fo extenfive a diftritt, abound- 
ing in public works, and daily increafing in population. 
There are no attorneys ; but that want is abundantly compen- 
fated by the vicinitude of Paifley and Glafgow. There are 
frequently two furgeons in the bounds. 

The numberof farmers atprefent is about 114. Many of them 
keep but one horfe, a number of their farms being fmall, but 

in 



* Gavin Ralfton, Efq. of Ralfton, 



t$z Statijth at Account 

in general, they keep two, nr morehorfes, and from 8 to 12, and 
fome of them 20 black cattle'. There are only four or five of 
them that have a flock of l'heep, if a hundred Iheep, the great- 
eft number any of them keep, is entitled to that appellation. 
Could the farmers in the higher grounds of this diftricl: main- 
tain their cattle during the winter and fpring months, with- 
out the aid of oat-draw, it would be their intereft to cultivate 
©nly grafs crops, potatoes, and turnip, with fome flax for 
their refpective families •, but though they have many natural 
meadows in their pofleffion, yet the grafs obtained from them 
is coarfe, and the quantity too fmail for that purpofe. They 
make up much of their rents by rearing young cattle, and fel- 
ling milk, which they drive in barrels on carts to Paifley. And 
as this parifh marches for a confiderable tract of country with 
Dunlop, fo famous for making cheefe, the foil, and quality of 
the grafs, cannot be greatly different. They fow from the 
middle of March to the end of April, and feldom reap foon- 
er than the end of September, with the exception of a few 
farms that may be more early. Confiderable part of the crop 
has, of late years, been often in the fields at the end of Oc- 
tober, in ftooks and huts. 

Rent of the Parifi. The valued rent of the parifh is 

1.4823:6:8 Scots. The real rent is fuppofed to be about 
L. 4210 Sterling. But from this fum confiderable deductions 
bitift be made for what is commonly called public burdens, as 
cefs, ftipend, road-money, fchool-maftcr's falary, &amp;c. 

Some farms let from 15 to 25s ; and land in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the villages at L. 2, nay, fome above that 
fum ; not that the land is worth that price, but people will do 
much, fometimes, for convenience, at other times from necef- 
fity. Koufes in the village of Nielftoii let at L. 1 : 10 to 
3 L. 2 



of Nieljlon. i$$ 

L. 2 per annum. The building of a cotton-mill near the vil- 
lage, has, in fome degree, railed their value. | 

Extraordinary^ rife of Rent The farm of Dubbs, the 

property of the Dowager Countefs of Glafgow, was let to the 
prefent tenant's father, as late as the year 1765, for L. 3 fter- 
ling, in money, and 5 bolls of meal and oats. It was after- 
wards railed to L.21 : io,and 4 bollsof meal, and it mw pays 
about L. 50 fterling. The fmall Barony of Auchinback con- 
fiding of about 460 acres, let, at the beginning of this centu- 
ry, for about L. 100, converting grain at 15s. per boll, and 
is now raifed to about L. 321. 

Prices of Labour and Provifions. A common labourer, 

called a darkfman, with his fpade, will earn is6d. fterling, 

per day; very ordinary workmen, is 2d Farmers 

men-fervants get L. 10 fterling, per annum, if able bodied 
and active ; women-fervants L. 3 : 10 per annum, befides be- 
ing victualled and lodged. The prices of thofe employed in 
the different departments at the public works vary. All of 
them are high. Engravers, &amp;c. at printfields, 19s fterling, 

per week If the prices of prcvifions differ here from 

thofe in the markets of Glafgow and Pailley, it is in their be- 
ing higher ; for the feller, when once on the road, if he thinks 
he can get a farthing more for his articles, at thefe towns, than, 
in the country, will fcarcely be prevailed upon to ftop, although 
he Ihould find himfelf miftaken, when he makes a trial at the 
end of his journey. 

Manufactures — There are two cotton mills already erected in 
the parifh, one called Dove-cot-hall, which is 76 feet long, 
28 feet wide, and 3 ftories high;— the other, named Gatefide, 
is 100 feet long, 31 wide, and 2 ftories high; but it is pro-

pofed to turn the whole of the latter into lodgings for the work 

people, and to erect a new mill on a much larger fcale. , 

The number of workmen employed in both mills, is, as fol- 
lows : 

Males above 15 - 29 
Females above 15 - 100 
Males under 15 94 
Females under 15 - 78 

301 

Average of wages paid to the above work-people per month, 
L. 217, or, at the rate of L. 2821 per annum. 

The Faraneze printfield pays L. 3,000 fterling, per annum y 
of excife-duty. And their extra expence may amount to 
L. 2,000 yearly. The profit and lofs of the company are 
known only to themfelves. 

The cotton mill of Stewart, Orr, and company, now erec- 
ting, is 127 feet long, 34 wide, and to be 5 ftories high and 
will probably add 500 people to this parifh. They will labour, 
however, under the difadvantage of not having a village in 
which to lodge their work-people, and muft necefiarily be 
put to great additional expence in buildings. 

The cotton-mill of Cochran and Airfton, erecting fartheft 
up the Lavern, as it is near the village of Nielfton, will have 
the advantage of the work-people refiding there. This mill is 
98 feet long, 34 wide, and is to be raifed 5 ftories. Theplace 
where the level is begun, for bringing the water, is, near the 
junction of the Lavern and of Coudon-Burn, about a quarter of 
a mile above the village, and about 266 feet above the level of 
the tide at Paifley. There are great fpeculations in the cotton 
bufmefs at prefent ; and yet fome, who pretend to fee as far as

their neighbours, have averred, that the (ilk gauze trade, 
which has been on the decline for fome years paft, is reviving, 
and will foon rival and furpafs the cotton; and, that the latter, 
may, in feven years time, be fo low, that fome people engaged 
in it may find the profits little enough to keep, and to pay the 
children, at the points of the fpindles. Whilft others contend, 
that the cotton trade is as yet only in its infancy. 

There are 85 looms in the Barhead and houfes adjacent, 48 
looms in the village of Nielflon, 9 in Uplamour-village, and 
there may be about 10 more in different parts of the parifh ; 
in all 152 looms, mofUy employed in working muflin, and 
filk-gauze. A few in what is called country work, (linen, 
&amp;,€.) for private families. 

Ecclefuijlical State. — There is only one minifter at prefent 

in.this extenfive and populous diitricl. Archibald Speirs, 

Efq. of Elderflie is patron. On the laft vacancy he very ge- 
neroufly gave the free choice of a minifter to the pnrifhioners. 
— The ftipend confiftsof feven chaldrons of meal, and L.33 : 10

* The glebe has this farther difadvantage, that there are four 
feus upon it, a circumflance which appears directly oppoiite to 
the dtiign of the legiflature in giving glebes to minilters in land- 
ward parifhes, which was to keep a hoile for riding, when doing 
parifh-duty, and to do any neceiTary work for themfelves, with 
grafs for two cows alfo, for the benefit of their families. This 
practice of feuing glebes appears alio exprekly contrary to the fta- 
tute laws of Scotland. It is fubmitted, therefore, to heritors and 
prefbyteries, whether, by permitting feus on glebes in large iand- 
ward pariflics, they do not thereby cut oft" the incumbents from

The church was built in 1 762 ; and it is believed will hold 
about 1000 people. It is ornamented with a neat fpire and a 
clock About two years ago, a number of heads of fami- 
lies wbo had little, and fome of them no room in the church, 
offered the heritors the fum of L. 3o, for adding to, or enlarg- 
ing an aifle in it, upon the fingle condition that the feats of 
this addition mould be annually let, by public roup, to parifhi- 
oners only, and the money arifing from them given to the 
poor. But the heritors did not chufe to accept of this offer. 
Had this plan taken place, it is the opinion of many, that it 
would not only have been a considerable accommodation to 
the parifhioners, but would have made fuch an addition to the 
poors funds, as would have prevented the neceffity of an affeff- 
ment for maintaining the poor for many years, which otherwife 
may become -indifpenfable. 

The fchool-honfe was built large, and commodious, laft 
year, with a dwelling-houfe in the upper ftory for the teach- 
er. The heritors alfo gave an area before the fchool-houfe, 
for the benefit of the children, and a garden to the fchool-maf- 
ter behind. The falary is L. 8 : 6 : 8. He may have between 
60 and 70 fcholars; —wages per quarter for Latin 3s, arithme-

much as their time, ftrength, and perfonal fafety will permit. 
To remedy this inconvenience, by the minifler's taking a farm, is 
a plan, in the prefent ftate of this country, inexpedient, and al-

and ItcI during the fummer quarter, from each fcholar for fire 
money. In moft parifhes, 6 hours attendance from the fcho- 
lars, during the longer days, and five during the fhorter days 
of the year, are required. By keeping evening fchools for 
arithmetic, church-mufic, &amp;c. every fchool-mafter, efpecial- 
Jy in large landward parifhes, may greatly increafe his emolu- 
ments. 

ScJJion ClerJ;Jhip.—Th\s office has L. I fterling falary paid 
out of the public money, is 6d for regiltration of marriages, 
6d. for baptifms, 3d. on a certificate of moral character to 3 
fingle perfon, though, it is believed, a certificate for a whole 
family has been charged 6d. There is alfo fome fmall per 
centage, for collecting the king's duty of 3d. on marriages, bap- 
tifms, and burials ; but this, inftead of being an advantage to 
the office, has, in moft parifhes, it is believed, proved a trou- 
blefomeand vexatious employment,and very difagreeable to the 
people at large. The regulations in the act are not calculated to 
extend to Scotland. In fome parts it is difficult to underftand.its 
import. It is clogged with a qualification on the part of the 
collector, the expence of which, in many parifhes, may re- 
quire more than all the profits he can make. Many people are 
deterred by the expence, triffling as it is, from regiftering ; 
and the duty can fcarcely bring in L. 1 fterling from each of 
the 950 parifhes in North Britain, a fum altogether inconfide- 
table •, and, when the expense cf collecting is deducted, it 
muft be very contemptible indeed. This ; s a fubjeel not un- 
worthy the attention of perfons in power, by whom alone the 
jnconveniencies attending this act can be remedied. — In many 
parifhes the church-feffion beftows the clerkfhip on the pa- 
riih fchocl-mafter, fome in vitara aid culpam ; others, for rea-

only for a limited time, or, during thepleafure of the court.

This laft mode will probably become the general practice in 
Scotland. In this very parifh, the office of fchool-mafter, 
during the former mailer's time, was held only during the 
pleafure of the majority of the heritors. 

Private Schools. — There are generally tv/o private fchools, 
one in the eaft end, and the other in the weft end of the pa- 
rim ; where the fchool-mafters depend entirely on the number 
and wages of their fcholars, which are always in proportion 
to their diligence and fuccefs in teaching. 

Inns and Akhonfcs. — There are not lefs than nineteen inns, or 
ale-houfes in this parifh, and no fewer than eight of thefe in the 
village of Nielfton. Houfes of that defcription can be of no 
benefit to the public, but in two refpects, ift, to accommo- 
date public meetings, or private companies on neceffary bufi- 
nefs; or 2dly, to entertain travellers by day, and to lodge 
ihem and their horfes, when overtaken by night. This laft, 
and not the leaft ufeful public benefit refulting from inns, per- 
haps not four of the nineteen are equal to. A que. ft ion then 
arifes, are the whole of the remaining fifteen neceffary, or what 
proportion of them is requilite for the public good ? The 
reader muft have already anticipated the anfwer that fhould 
be given. 

State of the Poor. — During the laft quarter of the year 
1786, the number of perfons on the poors roll, amounted to 30, 
and, in the fame quarter of the year 1790, 1034. Some of 
thefe are children •, fome aged ; one of them fatuous. They 
are fupported by the collections at the church door, which, at 
an average, feldom exceed 20s weekly; andthe intereft of afmail 
capital, amounting to about L. 140 fterling, which is the 
whole fund belonging to the parifh; together with is 6d. paid

i£e Statiftical Account 

The heritors are called once every year to audit, and pafs 
the Seffion's accounts, and examine the fecurities for the mo- 
ney lent. At thefe meetings it has been recommended to 
them, efpecially to the non-refiding heritors, to prevent far- 
ther encroachments upon the capital of the parifh funds, by 
their making up any annual deficiency, (which hitherto has 
been but trifling,) according to their refpeclive valuations; 
or, by fending a voluntary donation yearly to the poor, in fome 
kind of proportion to their refpeclive properties; and, to conti- 
nue this mode, without aflefling the people, while they conti- 
nue to give liberally. AflelTments indeed, never fail to coun- 
teract charity ; and were the people to be once afieucd, they 
would probably with-hold their collections altogether. It does 
not appear, however, with the exception of about two heri- 
tors, that this reprefentation has hitherto produced any effect. 
In this parifh, the non-refiding heritors, probably hold three 
fourths of the furface, and may, perhaps draw, the fame pro- 
portion, of the whole rent. It is faid, that in fome parts of 
Scotland, there are inftances of non-refiding heritors receiving 
almoft the whole rents of feveral parifhes, and yet, in fome of 
them, that they have never contributed a farthing to the fup- 
portof the poor. Equity, juftice, humanity, common fenfeitfelf, 
lift up their united voice, againftfo difgraceful a circumftance, if 
true ; nor is it any wonder, that in fuch diftriets, the difcerning 
part of the inhabitants look forward with pleafure to a coming 
day, when this " with-holding more than is meet," nay, with- 
holding every thing, may be counteracted, and when thofe in the 
middle and inferior ranks of life, {hall no longer have the folc 
burden impofed upon them.

rable offence.

At prefent, it may be obferved, that the burden of main- 
taining 34 poor people falls upon the refiding inhabitants in 
this pariih •, and, that the collecting, taking care of, and dif- 
tributing among them the fcanty pittance they receive, lies, 
(with the infpedion, and concurrence of the minifter) upon 
fix elders ; a clafs of men, who, in the different parilhes of 
Scotland, have, for thefe two centuries part, faved the land- 
ed intereft a fum, which may, perhaps, feem fmall, if com- 
pared with what has been expended, in maintaining an equal 
number of poor in a neighbouring kingdom, but which would 
have been confiderably felt, had it been exacted ; and, if a 
trifling falary of L. i or L. 2 fterling to a treafurer, which is 
only the cafe in fome parilhes, be excepted, the whole is mana- 
ged without a farthing of expence ; an inftance of frugality in 
an extenfive and public management, it is prefumed, not paral- 
lelled in Europe, and exhibiting at once, in thefe days of ve- 
nality, a ftriking and lingular example of public fpirit, and 
Chriftian charity. But this ufeful body of men appear to be 
on the decline, as t^ number, at leaft in the well of Scotland. 
Few people chufe to accept an office, which not only has not 
the fmalleft emolument annexed to it, but, as far as connec- 
ted with the management of the poor, is a thanklefs and trou- 
blefome bufinefs. The refpe&amp;ive fefliors (veftries), in this 
part of Scotland, are alfo in general very ill accommodated, 
and deftitute even of common convenience for managing the 
public bufinefs; few country parilhes have a fefiion-houfe j 
and the elder, when colleclingthe offering, in many places, has 
not fo much as a fhade, to fcreen him from the fevereft tempeft. 
Their attachment alfo to the Eftablifhed Church has, in many 
places, been greatly weakened by caufes well known, and now 
long experienced in the weftern dillricls, where with a fpirit 
of commerce, a high fenfe both of civil and religious liberty 
now prevails. What the refult of this may be, time will dif-

cover ; but one confequence is evident, that the care of the 
poor can hardly continue long on its prefent footing, and 
mud of courfe devolve on the heritors, and parifhioners at 
large. 

Advantages and D if advantages. — The general lightnefs of 
the foil, and the elevation of great part of the diftri£t, are not 
favourable to agriculture; but, from the vicinity to large towns, 
there is a ready market for the productions of the farm, and 
often at very high prices. Oatmeal, however, is to be excepted, 
which, on an average, has not been fold above is. per peck 
thefe twenty years paft *. In regard to manufactures there 
are many advantages, in particular, the great command cf 
water, and the abundance of fuel. With thefe natural advan- 
tages, provided fobriety and induftry can alfo be maintained, 
the greateft ends may be accomplifhed •, and they will proba- 
bly be the means of raifing the fhire of Renfrew in general, 
and this diftri£t of it in particular, to a degree of commer- 
cial confluence and wealth, which fome years ago could not 1 
have been expected. 

Conftdcrable difadvaniages y huwever, are likely to follow the 
rapid increafe of manufactures, which are already beginning 
to out-rival agriculture, the bafis and fupport of all other arts. 
—-Farmers now complain that their fervanu defert them, 
and engage in manufactures, where they receive higher wa- 
ges, and have lefo laborious employment. But it is not an 
extroardinary rife of wages 2 that will fecuve either induftry, or 

economy ; 

* This, if in favour of the manufacturer, is againft the fanner, 
who alledges, that, as all wages have doubled within thefe 20 years, 
that all ihould pay a reafonable and proportionable rife on this, $t 
well as on other eorcmoditita, and on labour itfelf. 



o/Nieljlctu I63 

economy; in mod cafes it produces the contrary effect. 
It is well known in many of the manufacturing diftricts, that 
when wages are high* many of the operative tradefmen are i- 
dle, at leafl: three days in the week. It is alfo notorious, that 
many of them, who earn, by conltant induftry, about 7s. per 
week, often bring up creditable families, without contracting 
debt, giving their children wholefome food, decent clothes, and 
ordinary fchool education ; while others, who gain almofl: thrice 
that fum, have fcarccly common credit. The reafons are ob- 
vious ; when the wholefome viands of our own country are de- 
fpifed,'and even the firll meal of the day cannot be taken, but 
of commodities brought from two of the moll diftant parts of 
the globe, and every fubfeqaent repaft is proportionally ex- 
penfive, large debts, and an incapacity to pay them, are the ne- 
ceffary confequences. How foon fuch luxurious habits may o- 
peratc to the deftruction of commerce itfelf, cannot be deter- 
mined : But furely a German, or Ruffian manufacturer, who 
can content himfelf with fimple fare, may bring his goods to 
the different market towns of Europe, and tranfport them e- 
ven beyond the Atlantic, at a much cheaper rate, than where 
fuch modes of living are practifed. The obfervation alfo of a 
late judicious philofophef * is daily verified, that, in every 
country through which he had travelled, where manufactures 
flourilhed, he obferved that beggars abounded ; and mould 
poors rates, from this caufe, become neceffary, and univerfal 
in this country, this will be a very evident difadvantage. 
It is alfo apprehended, that the rapid imreafe of manufac- 
tures, is neither friendly to the health, nor morals of the peo- 
ple. In cotton mills a multitude of children are env»

ployed, before they receive even common education. They 
there fpend, perhaps, a confiderable part of their life, without 
any other principles for the direction of their conduct, but 
thofe which natural confcience dictates. The lower ranks of 
mankind, however, whenjcollected, and confined together, are 
too apt to corrupt one other ; and, when affembled in fuch 
promifcuous crowds, are probably often expofed not to the 
beft example. It is to be feared alfo, that a total ignorance of 
Chriftianity, which, even among the loweft of the people, 
was lefs the characteriftic of this country, than any of the 
neighbouring kingdoms, will foon become prevalent; and, 
if one ignorant race once arife, it is probable that not only 
the next, but many fucceeding ones, of the fame defcription, 
will follow *. The children, too, in thefe works, confined, 
as it were, to the very point of a fpindle, muft of courfe have 
narrow ideas and contracted minds. The finer parts of the 
cotton, alfo, in the progrefs of the work, flying off continual- 
ly by friction, fills the atmofphere in which they breathe, with 
unwholefome particles, and it is probably from this caufe, 
that their appearance in general is fo pale and fickly. Nor 
ought it to be omitted, that the oil on the different parts of 
the machinery, coming often in contact with their clothes and 
bodies, occafions an effluvium, which, to any perfon accuftom- 
ed to the open fields, or to a well-aired apartment, is fenfibly 
felt, even when palling along the road. 

In a military view, the lofs that the public muft fuftain,

* It has been recommended to the proprietors of thefe public

contrary to the axiom, fo ably inculcated by a great political 
author*, " that the ftrength of a country docs not fo much

Notwithflanding thefe difadvantages, it appears, atprefenf, 
to be the wifh of the landholders, in the weftem diftri£ts of 
Scotland, to give every poflible encouragement to all kinds of 
manufactures f ; nay, fuch is the rage for them in this parifh, 
that corn mills are dcfpifed, or forgotton, even by their proprie- 
tors. Two have been allowed to go into total difrepair ; one cf 
the fe has been advertifed for a cotton-work; and a third, 
though in good repair, h;:s been actually fuperfeded, and is 
now an appendage to a cotton-mill; fo that there are at

at heart to prevent, as far as his influence and example 
will go, the difadvantages that may follow ; and above all, 
the evils that may be dreaded from a relaxation in the 
morals of the people, which were formerly fo pure, and

fARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q615693">RENFREW</name>.</head> 



<p>ENFREW is one of the royal burghs of Scotland, an** 



' head town of the county. It (lands 3 miles north of 
Paifley, and 5 miles Weft of Glaigow. The high-way from 
Glafgow to Greenock runs through it. Some think that Ren- 
frew is theRanduara mentioned by Ptolomy. Be that as it may, 
it is certainly of great antiquity, for mention is made of it in 
the chartularies of Dumfermline and Paifley. An. 1164, in 
the Reign of Malcolm IV. a battle was fought near the town, 
between Sumerled, Thane of Argyle, and Gilchrift, Earl of' 
Angus, in which Scmerled was put to flight. The name of 
the difhict is probably derived from the Gaelic. The name 
fcy which it is known, in that language, Rein-froach^ fignifies 
the heath dlvificti. It is not at all improbable, that, in former 
time*, the country around the burgh, was intitled to that ap- 
pellation j for many people, ftill alive, remember when a 
great part of the ground to the fouth of the town, was unin- 
clofed, and quite covered with heath. 

It was erected into a royalty by King Robert, From that

By the Rev. Mr. Thomas Burns, 



Toivn of Renfrew.

prince a charter was obtained, confirming all the- privileges 
granted by himfeJf or his predecefiors. Other charters were 
given by James VI. of Scotland, and by Queen Anne. The 
town formerly fent a reprefentative to the Scots parliament; 
but, finee the Union, it forms only part of a diftricl: ; and in 
conjunction with Glafgow, Dumbarton, and Rutherglen, e- 
lecls a member of the Iiritilh legiflature. 

The town is about half a mile in length, but in fome place* 
fo narrow, that it is with great difficulty two carriages can pafs 

each other. There arc fome fmall Erects and lanes in it, 

befides the principal ftreet. 

It is governed by a provoft, 1 baillies, and 16 counfellors. 
The revenue amounts to about L. 360 per annum, and confifts 
of rents from lands, fifhings, cufloms, a public ferry boat p- 
ver the river Clyde, &amp;c. Its right to a falmon fithery on the 
Clyde extends from Scot ftoun to Kelly bridge, and yields an 
income of L. 75 per annum. The ferry was formery between 
the King's-Ineh and Blawert-hill, but is now removed about 
a qumer of a mile farther down the river. The place is 
broader, and much more expofed to the weather, than where it 
formerly was : But there objections are compenfated by other 

advantages. There is now a ferry-houfe on each fide of the 

river, the property of the town, and a mod complete ferry- 
boat, built by fublcription, purpofely for carriages; in which, 
by means of a rope, fixed upon each fide of the river, and run- 
ning upon 4 rollers, two at each end of the boat, one placed 
in a horizontal direction, and the other perpendicular, any 
carriage, with a pair of horfes, can be eafily boated, and car- 
ried over by one man in five minutes. It is believed, that the re- 
venue of this town, will, in a few years, be confiderably en- 
creafed, by the change in the ferry, and this eafy mode of con- 
veyance. 

There are a good many falmon at times caught in the river,

though not ne?.r fo manv as formerly. Two caufes may be af- 
figned for this : The one is, the deepening of the river, when 
the fifli were difturbed in their courfe for fo many years ; — 
the other is, the the public works which are now carried on in 
the neighbourhood upon the river. 

Maw/faclures, &amp;c — The commerce of this town is very 
inconfiderable, though, in regard to local fituation, it is not 
inferior to any place in the neighbourhood. Indeed had it not 
been for the fatal effects of borough-politics, it might, at this 
time, have been one of the principal feats of manufactures in 
the weft of Scotland. There is a foap and candle work, car- 
ried on here, upon a pretty large fcale ; which, though lately e- 
rected, is of confiderable advantage to the place. There is al- 
fo a fmall branch of the thread manufacture. Four mills are 
employed for this purpofc ; and each machine for twining the 
thread, is fuppofed to require, on an average, 36 perfons. 
There is alfo a fmall bleachfield at the eaft end of the town, 
which employs about 6 men, and 24 women. The wages of 
the men are from 7s. 6d. to 12s per week; and thofe of the 
■women from 2s 6d. to 6s. a week. The number of looms in 
the town, is- from 117 to 120, partly for filk, but principally 
for muflin, chiefly on account of the manufacturers of Paif- 
ley. Thefeare the only branches of trade carried on here, 
and all of them are of fhort ftanding. 

Climate, —No place, perhaps, in the weft of Scotland, 
is fo peculiarly healthy as Renfrew. Epidemical diftempers 
are ever hardly known. Two reafons may be affigncd for this. 
The one is, that the town ftands upon a bed of fund, of great 
depth, fo that all the heavy rains, which fall here, are foon ab- 
iorbed ; and consequently, dangerous damps, and unwhole- 
fome fogs are hardly ever felt. The other reafon ib the good-

rtefs of the water, which is fuperior in quality to moft pla* 

ccs, perhaps, in Scotland. There are many inftances of 

longevity to be met with. Several perfons now living in the 

parifh are above 80, and fome above 90 The fmall-pox 

has been very fatal to the young, for thefe two years pad : 
Yet there ft ill continues a backwardnefs among the lower clafa 
of people, to inoculation, partly owing to the expence attend- 
ing it, and partly to prejudice. The operation is fo fimple, 
that many , of late, however, have not only been perfuaded of 
its advantage, but have adtuajly inoculated their own children. 

Schools. — There is no parochial fchool in this parifh, though 
there is great need of one. One is kept in the ft flion-houfe, 

though another place for it would be more defirable 

The falary of this fchool-mafter arifes from the fuppreflion of 
an antient hofpital, " the hail rents and pertinents of 
" which are difponed to the burgh, for the fupport of the 
" grammar fchool j and the fame to be called the grammar 
" fchool of Renfrew, in all time coming." The provoft, 
baillies, and council are the patrons — There is abundance of 
employment here for two fchool-mafters ; and many families 
in Renfrew feel the want, and earneftly wifh a fecond. . . 
To the credit of the people in general, it may be remarked, 
that not only tradefmen, but even day-labourers, give their 
children a good education. Scarce a boy who is hot taught 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, a little church mufic, &amp;c. 
And mould any of them be neglected in their youth, when 
they come to the years of difcretion, they go to fchool, at their 
own expence, in order to acquire thefe branches. This is an 
important advantage which the Scots, as a nation, enjoy over 
the natives of other countries.

prefbytery of Paifley, and fynod of Glafgow and Ayr. Its 
extent varies from 3 to 4 miles in length and breadth, but its 
figure is very irregular, being frequently interfe&amp;ed by the ri- 
vers in the neighbourhood, and by the abbey parifh of Paifley. 
All kinds of foil are to be found in it. Some part of it confifts 
of a light kind of fand ; which, without conflant attention or 
manure, would foon return to its natural ftate. Some is rather 
inclined to a kind of till. A great part of it is a ftrong clay, but a 
ft 111 greater part is a deep rich loam. In general, however, 
the whole of the parifh is good ground, capable of yielding 
excellent crops, of the different forts of grain, ufually cultivated 

in Scotland. There is very little mofs ; and not many 

acres in planting. 

In the courfe of the laft century, the town of Renfrew 
flood upon the banks of the river Clyde, and vefTels of confi- 
derable burden were built clofe to the town. But the river 
left its ufual courfe, nearly oppofite to Scotftoun, took a femi- 
circular direction, leaving the King's-Inch upon the north 
fide, and running along by the. bottom ,of the garden be- 
longing to the manfe, came into its prefent direction, juft a- 

bout the place where the ferry now is. — . There is a pretty 

large canal made, on the old bed of the river, from the Clyde 
to the town, where even large vefTels can come and unload at 
fpring tides. There is another canal made, to accommodate the 

people of Paifley. When the bridge of Inchinnan was built, 

the navigation to that town was very much obftrufled. Vef* 
fels were then obliged to pafs through the arches, which could 
not be done without lowering their marts, the channel below 
the bridge became vaftly wider, and of courfe very fhallow. 
To render the navigation of the river fit for vefTels with fixed 
mails, the town of Paifley obtained liberty, to make a cut about 
half a mile in length, in which, there is a very complete draw- 
bridge,inthe turnpike road, at the eaftend of Inchinnan bridge.

—Not far from this fpot, on the north fide of the road, the 
Marquis of Argyle was taken, after he had crofled the river 
on foot : — a party lay waiting for him the moment he came 
out of the water 5 he attempted co fire upon them, but, his 
piftols being wet, would not difcharge, upon which, one of 
the ruffians came behind him, and cut him on the head with 
a fword ; in the mean time, the Laird of Greenock came up, 
knew the Marquis, and took him prifoner. He was firft 
carried to Renfrew, and thence to Edinburgh, where he was 
beheaded, on the 30th June, 1685. 

Population. — In 1695, it appears from the poll-books, that 
there were in the country part of the parilh 5 1 families ; at 
prefent there are 88. At that time, and long after it, a great 
part of the pariffi lay unimproved and uninclofed, merely in a 
ftate of nature. All thefe lands are now improved, inclofed, 
and parcelled out in fmall farms. In 1755, the return to Dr. 
Webfter, amounted to 109 1. In March, 1791, the popula- 
tion of the parifli of Renfrew, was as follows :

The number of deaths, in the two laft years, was owing t* 
the natural final! pox. 

Rent, Proprietors, &amp;c. The valued rent of the parifh is 

L. 3629 Scots, the real rent probably more than L. 3000. 
Some of the lands in the parifh are let at 5s and 7s 6d. an 
acre ; fome at 40s ; and fome of the lands around the town, 
at L. 4 fterling. There are 10 heritors in the parifh, and i 
great number of portioners, pofTefling what is called Burgher 
lands, holding of the town. Three of the greater proprietors, 
either occafionally, or conftantly, refide in the parifh. There 
is neither a furgeon nor a writer refiding in it, a circumftance 
which is not much to be regretted. 

Crops. — The chief crops are oats, barley, wheat, and pota- 
toes. There is alfo a confiderable quantity of clover and rye- 
grafs fown every year, which, in general, anfwers extremely 
well. Potatoes are a great crop, particularly round the town, 
and there is a good market for them at Paifley. The foil is 
exceedingly favourable for them, being a deep rich loam, upon 
a bed of fand : Seventy-two bolls of very fine potatoes, have 
been produced on an acre. 

Though the ground near the town has enjoyed no reft, in 
the memory of the oldeft man living, yet ftill it bears good 
crops of every kind. They crop it, as long as the produce 
is tolerable, then they trench it ; and in this way they go 
on. 

Oats are fown in March or April,--barley in April or May,— 
and wheat generally in Oclober. The glebe laft year was^fown 
in November, after fallow, and the wheat on it was as early, and 
as good as any in the country. In general, the wheat round 
the town, and indeed in moil places of this country is fown 
1 -after 



174 



Statijlical Account 



after potatoes. Such a rotation requires a good foil, potatoes 
being a much feverer crop than mod people are aware of. 
It is a certain fact, that wheat, produced from fallow ground, 
will always bring a better price, than wheat after pota- 
toes *. 

Ecclefiajlical State. — The church was built in 1726. It is 
not very well conftru&amp;ed, nor is it fufficient to contain the 

inhabitants of the parifh. The king is patron. 

The {Upend confifts cf ' 12 chalders of meal, payed in money 
by the college of Glafgow, according to the fiars of the Com- 
mhTariot of Hamilton and Campfie. The glebe is about four 
acres 5 and the whole living amounts to about L. 150 per an- 
num. 

Poor. In confequence of an unfortunate mifunderftand- 

ing, between the late incumbent and the heritors, the former 
threw up all connexion with the management of the poor, and 
theilatter chofe a treafurer of their own ; and in this ftate matters 

ftill 

* There 13 no part of Scots agriculture more difficult to deter- 
mine, than what crop mould precede wheat. Fallow ought if 
poffible to be avoided, as it is lofing a year. Wheat after tur- 
nips (unlefs fpring wheat) is liable to the fame objection, at lealt, 
if the turnips are fuffered to come to perfection. The £rop of po- 
tatoes being ready for gathering, when the wheat ought to be fown 
is a ftrong temptation to make the one follow the other ; but po- 
tatoes, inftead of enriching, rather exhauft the foil, and make 
the ground too loofe and open, which endangers the crop of wheat 
during the frcfts. Oats, — barley, — clover, — wheat, would per- 
haps be the beft rotation where the ground was rich enough for 
it. W»qx ooj. t

ftill continue. There, is, however, a good fund; the inte- 
reft of which, together with the collections at the church 
doors, fhould be fufficient, with a little affiftance, to fupply 
the poor of the parifli. But the opulent, who do not chufe to 
attend divine fervice, fliould fend their mite regularly to 
the poor ; otherwife people of inferior rank, may be temp- 
ted to imitate their example, not in abfenting themfelves 
from the church, but in with-holding their contributions. 

Mifcellaneous Obfcrvatlons. There is no regular market 

here, though butcher- meat can be had occafionally.— — — — 
The average price of oat-meal, for feme years paft, has been 
1 s. per peck ; — potatoes 8 d. (double the meafure of Edin- 
burgh) ; — mutton from 5d. to 8d. per pound; — beef from 
5d. to 8d. — and hens 3 s. a pair. Servants and day-labourers 
wages are very high. There are men now living, who, 
when young, thought L. 2 : ro a year, great wages ; and 
now, a hired fervantby the year gets L. 10. "Women remem- 
ber, when they thought L. 1 : 10 a year, great wages; and 
now they are L. 2 a half year. Day-labourers now alive, 
have wrought for 5d. and 6d. a day. Day-labourers are 
now fcarce, and not to be got under is. 6d. a day; and at 
this moment, women are receiving is. 4d. a day, and is. a day,

now procure it at 2s. 6d. and makes intereit to purchafe it 

at that price. Horfes, that fome years ago were thought 

extravagantly high at L. 1 8, now bring L. 30 and L. 35.

<p>Name, Extent, Situation, and Boundaries. 

THE parifh probably derives its prefent appellation from 
the noble family of that name, though vague tradition 
gives it a different origin. The whole diftricl: formerly feems 
to have been called Cadzoiv. It is fituated in the centre of the 
middle ward of the county of Lanark, and is the feat of the 
prefbytery which bears its name, fubjttt to the fuperior juris- 
diction of the fynod of Glafgow and Ayr. It is almoft a fquare, 
extending about fix miles, from north-eaft to fouth-weft, and 
being about five miles from north-weft to fouth-eaft. The ri- 
ver Clyde runs along the eaft and north of the parifh, forming 
nearly the boundary, excepting in one pLce, where a large 
corner is cut off on the north fide of the river. The parifhes 
by which it is bounded are Dalziel and Cambufnethan on the 
eaft, Dalferf and Stonhoufe on the fouth, Glafsford and 
Blantire'on the weft, and Bothwel on the north.

Surface and Soil- — Along the Clyde lie extenfive vallies of 
a deep and fertile foil. Thence the land rifes gradually every- 
where to the fouth-weft, to a configurable height ; in the 
highefl parts being about 600 feet above the level of the feaj 
but without forming itfelf into any hill, or becoming remarka- 
bly uneven. The foil of the riGng ground is moftly of a clay- 
ifli nature. The lower puns of the afcent are tolerably fertile, 
and well cultivated ; but from the nature of the foil and bot- 
tom, the crops are feldom early. The highefl: parts often 
produce fcanty, and always late crops. The furface, not being 
broken by any great irregularities, rhe land is all arable,except 
fome fteep banks by the fides of the rivers and brooks, a few 
fwampy meadows in the upper part of the parifli, and fuch 
parts as are covered with planting or natural wood, the ex- 
tent of which is (till confiderable ; though much ground, for- 
merly covered with wood, has been converted into corn- 
fields. 

Rivers. — Befides the Clyde, already mentioned, a fmaller ri- 
ver, called the Avon, which comes from the fouth, and runs 
near four miles through the parifli, empties itfdf into the Clyde 
near the town. The banks of the Avon, as it pafl'es through 
the Duke of Hamilton's park, are high and bold; and, being 
covered with wood of various kinds, having different tints of 
foliage, are extremely pid~turefque, forming a fine contraft 
with the plains below. There are feveral other frnajl ftreams, 
the banks of which are well wooded in the low ground, but 
naked towards their fources in the upper country. 

Salmon, trout, pike, perch, roach, lampreys, filver eels, 
and fmall flounders, are found in thefe flreams and rivers j but 
no kind of fifli in great abundance, excepting the minnow. 
The quantity of falmon, in particular, has much decreafed 
of late years. The number of fry killed by anglers, the great

Sfhery carried on, in the populous country lower down the 
Clyde, the deepening of the channel for improving the naviga- 
tion from the lea to Glafgow, and the manufacturing machi^ 
nery erected on the river, are fuppofed to have difturbed and 
delhoy^d the fifh; and, by preventing them from getting regu- 
larly to their fpawning ground, muft necefiarily have diminifh- 
ed their numbers. There is no regular market for any kind 
of fifh caught here ; but of late, fome furplus falmon from 
the Duke's fifliery have been fold, in the plentiful feafon, for 
2d. per pound avoirdupois, lafl year at 3d. and this year at 4d. 
In deep dill pools, are found a large bivalvular fhell-fifh, 
known here by the name of the horfe mufcle. They are not 
ufed as food, but in fome of them are found fmall pearls ; fo 
rarely, however, that they are fcarcely thought worth the fifh- 
ing for. 

The rivers are not navigable here; but in great rains they 
fwell to a confiderable height, and cover a great extent of the 
lowland; fometimes fweeping away the crops by the violence 
of the inundation. On the 12th of March 1782, in particu- 
lar, the flood was near two feet higher than was ever remem- 
bered before ; and the river rofe about 1 6 feet perpendicular, 
above the ordinary level of low water. It overflowed a great 
tract of country, and appeared like an arm of the fea. 

There are two bridges over the Clyde in this parilh; one of 
an old Handing, called Bothwel bridge ; famous for a fkirmifh 
in the reign of King Charles II. between a body of the Whig?, 
and a party of the King's army, in which the former were rou- 
ted with a great flaughter. The other was built immedi- 
ately below the influx of Avon, under the authority of an act 
of parliament ; and was finifhed in 17S0. Avon has alfotwo 
bridges ; one on the road through Hamilton towards Carlyle, 
which was built before the 16th century; and ftrengthened and

beginning of the prefent century*; the other was built laft year,

Buildings. — Hamilton houfe, the refidertce of the duke of 
that name, a large and well built pile, (lands on the upper 
border of the great valley, lying weft of the conflux of 
the two rivers. The modern part, which is by far the moft 
eonfiderable, was built about the end of the laft century ; 
but part of the houfe is of longer {landing, bearing date 
1591 This palace, (as it is fometimes called,) was at firft 
built in the middle of the town, which formerly flood cluf- 
tering around it ; but the lower part having been gradually put- 
chafed, and pulled down, by the noble family above mention- 
ed, for the extenfion and improvements of their pleafure 
grounds, (as foon as the more fecure ftate of the country gave 
them lefs occafion for the afliftance and protection of the inha- 
bitants,) the town has fince ftretched to the fouth and weft, and

* The following tradition is handed down with refpe&amp; to the 
rirfl building of this bridge. Some controverted point was to be 
fettled by a plurality of voices, at a meeting of the clergy, to be 
held at Hamilton, upon a certain day. A prieft who lived fouth- 
ward from the town, had been very zealous on one fide of the con- 
troverfy, and had prevailed with a great number of the brethren in 
his neighbourhood, to join him in fupporting it. But on the day 
fixed, when they came to the fide of the river, it was fwoln with 
the rains beyond the pofiibility of pafiing, and the oppofite par- 
ty carried the point ; at which, the prieft was fo much provoked, 
that, being very rich, he immediately ordered a bridge to be built 
at his own expence, that fuch a difappointment might not occur in 
future.

nvains of fhe antient manor-houfe, called Cadzow-caftle, 
which feems to have been deferted, after the injuries which it 
fuffered by Regent Murray's army, are ftill to be feen on the 
weft bank of the Avon, in the middle of the great park, about 
a mile from the town : And, on the oppofite fide of the fame 
river, ftands a fhowy building, in imitation of a ruin, executed 
from a defign of the elder Adams. It \f as built by the Duke of 
Hamilton, about 1730, and is faid to have been intended as a 
reprefentation of the caftle of Chatelherault, in France, of 
which his anceftors were dukes. — The town is very irregular- 
ly built, fkirting around the bottom of a riling ground, above 
three quarters of a mile in length. It is a confiderable tho- 
rough-fare, the roads from Glafgow to England, and from 
Edinburgh to Ayrfhire, &amp;c. paffing through it. In the mid- 
dle there is a prifon and town-houfe, built in 1643, contain- 
ing a court, hall, &amp;c- There are alfo convenient build- 
ings for markets; in particular, one for butchers' meat, which 
is in general pretty well flocked with the ordinary forts, at 
their different feafons. 

The parifh church is a handfome building, erected in 1732, 
inftead of an old one, which ftood hard by the palace. It 
ftands upon the rifing ground above the town, and makes a 
very good appearance. It was alfo defigned by Mr Adams. To» 
wards the weft end of the town, there is a large meeting-houfe, 
built by the people who were unwilling to fubmit to theun» 
limited exercife of patronage, in J776: And on the eaft fide, 
a meeting-houfe for the people of the Antiburgher perfuafion, 
built in the year 1761; and lately repaired and enlarged. 

Near the town-houfe, ftands an hofpital or alms-houfe, 
built inftead of one which ftood in the lower part of the town, 
now erazed, and was endowed by the noble family of Hamil- 
ton, and other pious donors. It contains lodgings for eight 
poor men, a hall for morning and evening prayers, befidej

fome {hops and rooms fet for the benefit of the funds. To trig 
weft, there is another hofpkal, for four old men and their fa- 
milies*, built and endowed in the year 1775, by William 
Aikman, Efq. proprietor of an eftate in the parifh, and fomc 
time merchant in Leghorn. 

It is difficult to determine, at what period (he town was 
built. The lower part, which was certainly the oldeft, no 
longer remains. One houfe ftill ftanding, has date 1533, cut 
over the gateway ; and parts of fome others are faid to be ftill 
older. A writing among the town records, which bears to 
have been prefented to the Court of Seflion, in 1580, fets 
forth, that the " town was erected into a free burgh of ban 
M ny by the king's molt noble progenitors, in the year 
u 1456." In 154B, Mary, Queen of Scotland, created it a 
free royal burgh. But the rights and privileges thus acquired 
from the Crown, were, after the Reftoration, refigned into 
the hands of William and Ann, Duke and Duchefs of Ha- 
milton; who, in 1670, reftored to the community its former 
polTeffions, and erected it into a " burgh of regality," depen- 
dent on them and their fuccefibrs : and thus it has continued, 
after fome ineffectual ftruggles, to this time. 

Air, Difeafes, £yV. — The air is generally reputed tolerably 

dry and healthful Fogs are not frequent, and rains lefs fo 

than at other places a few miles diftant; infomuch that it is a 
general complaint, in this and fome of the neighbouring parifh- 
es, that they are later in getting refrefhing fhowcrs, than molt 
other parts of the country. This is one caufe of the latenefs 
of the harvefts. After the fummer folftice, the rains are 
commonly more copious ; and during open weather in the 
winter feafon, a great deal often falls. 

The water of many of the wells about the town is

hard * ; but neither that, nor any thing in the air, is thought 
to be injurious to the health of the inhabitants.— There is no 
dife.ife peculiar to the place. Colds, fevers of different kinds, 
particularly flow nervous fevers, fluxes, l'mall-pox, &amp;c. pre- 
vail here, at times, as in other places around. Inoculation 
for the fmall-pox is pr;c~lifed, but the common people are not 
reconciled to it. tSeventy-five children were fwept away by 
this dife.ife in 1787. The ague, or any fpecies of intermit- 
ting fevers, is not known here, except with people who have 
caught the difeafe in other countries, and are vifitfed with oc- 
cafional returns of it f . A good many people in this parifh 
have arrived at a great age ; fcveral having died of late years 
from 90 to above 100; particularly a man and lus wife, the 
one 106, and the other 102 : There are fevcral above 80 now 
living. 

Cattle, Cultivation, and Produce. A few years ago, the 

principal part of the parifli was occupied in tillage, and then 
above 300 horfes were employed in cultivating the land, and 
900 cows were kept, befides the young ftock of both kinds. 
But the land being now moftly inclofcd, fome farms are, at 
times, turned into paiture for fattening, which diminifhes the 
number of horfes and milch-cows. There are 30 draught 
horfes kept in the town, principally by carters, who ply for 

hire ; 

* That is, tin&amp;ured with fome mineral admixtures. 

f The fcurvy is almoft unknown, nor are any kind of cutaneous; 
difeafes frequent, though oat-meal makes a great part of the food 
of the people. Thofe, who are difpofed to reprobate the ufe of 
this wholefome and nourifhing fund o e fubfiftence, ought to exa- 
mine the healthy and blooming countenances of the people in this 
country, who feed on fcarcely anyother food, before they condemn 
the ufe of it in toto.

hire; 16 for the conveyance of travellers, and about 100 milch- 
cows for the ufe of the inhabitants. There are no fheep now- 
bred and kept in the parifh, except a few pets from different 
Englifh breeds. But great numbers are annually bought in ,to 
be fattened on the paftures, particularly thofe round the pa- 
lace of Hamilton,- fometimes to the amount of 1700, or i8ce 
in a feafon. 

In this parifh, as well as in all the neighbouring ones, every 
farmer formerly kept a few fheep, which were of a kind more 
domefticated and improved, than thofe now bred in the moun- 
tains. Their bodies were long and fquat made, their heads 
erect, having either fmall horns, or no horns at all, their legs 
fhort, their faces and legs white, or flightly fprinkled with 
black or brown fpots, their fleeces foft, and moftly of the 
longeft kind of carding wool ; their tails were not fo long as 
thofe of the Englifh fince introduced, nor fo fhort as thofe of 
the mtiiriand fheep, but defcended almofl to the knee joint, 
and feldom below it. Thefe fheep were conftantly attended 
by a boy or girl during the day, whom they followed to and 
from the paflure, and penned at night in a houfe called the 
Bught, which had flits in the walls to admit the air, and was 
(but in with a hurdle door. In this houfe was a rack, into 
which peafe-ftraw or foft hay was put, in winter, every even- 
ing, and in times of fnow, a few ftalks of unthrefhed peafe 
or oats were added ; and the floor was littered from time to 
time with dry ftraw, or turfs dried and piled up in fummer. 
Thefe little flocks were the peculiar care of their owners. The 
whole family was interefted in the bufmefs : for every child 
claimed the property of a ewe-lamb, and its future progeny, 
and an emulation prevailed among them, who fhould pofief; 
the handfomeft, and mofl valuable part of the flock. Hence, 
after yeaning-time, the young were daily examined with the 
gveateft folicitudc, and a hairy or fpotted fleece, a defective 

habit 



of Hamilton. 



habit of body, an aukward fhape, horns too thick at the bot- 
tom, or ftreaked with black, were blemilhes which doomed 
the animal irrevocably to the knife ; none being preferred for 
ftock, but fuch as poflefled all the characleriftics of beauty 
and utility. In this manner were thefe fheep improved to 
fuch a degree, that their wool was preferred to any then 
known in the neighbouring markets. When inclofmg with 
hedges became frequent, the farmers were obliged to part 
with thefe little flocks, which injured the young fences, and 
gradually fold them off for fiaughter; fo that no remains of 
them can now be traced in this part of the country. 

This parifh produces wheat, oats, peafe, beans, barley, 
hay, cheefe and butter, fome flax, and a good many pota- 
toes. Wheat is fometimes fown after peafe and beans, oats 
or potatoes, but generally after fallow. The produce com- 
monly is from 40 to 70 Winchefter bufhek per Scots acre ; 
but, in 1783, 84, and 85, the long fevere frofts in the fpring 
deftroyed the young wheat, and, for fome years after, great- 
ly difcouraged this branch of agriculture. The farmers, how- 
ever, are again returned to their former practice of fowing this 
grain, finding wheat a very beneficial crop, when it fucceeds. The 
cultivation of it, however, does not anlwer well on the higher 
grounds ; and, all over the neighbourhood, it meets with ob- 
structions from the autumnal rains ; by which the foil is fo 
much foftened, as to be unfit for the reception of the feed, or 
bearing working cattle to cover it in. 

Formerly a confiderable q^mtity of barley of an excellent 
quality/ was produced here, particularly in the lower parts of 
the parifh,; but the backward fprings, and cold inconfbnt 
fummers, which have been prevalent for more than twenty 
years pall, have been very unfavourable to the growth of that 
plant, particularly, where the predominant foil is clay. Huf- 
bandmen advanced in life, concur in afferting, that the average

produce of barley is now fcarcely three fifths of what it was 
in their younger days ; and the culture of it is almoft aban- 
doned, except for cleaning and preparing the land for the 
reception of artificial graffes. 

The greater part of the pariih produces good peafe and 
beans ; the feeds of which are, for the moft part, fown promif- 
cuoufly, the one or the other kind preponderating more or lefs, 
as the cultivator apprehends the foil and circumftances of the 
cafe may require. On the poorer land, peafe are fown alone ! 
and, in favourable feafons,a conficlerable quantity of thefe kinds 
of grain is produced and fent to market. But the late unfa- 
vourable yean have been much more productive of flraw than 
of feed, and have tended greatly to difcourage the culture of 
thefe plants *. Indeed there is no kind of crop, which more' 
frequently difappoints the expectation of the hulbandman. 

Wheat and oats are now the grains on which the farmef 
principally depends. Wheat, coming fosward early in the 
feafon, tills and ripens, while the days are long and the fun 
powerful. Oats are of a very hard nature, and are brought to 
maturity by a lefs degree of heat than the other ordinary field 
crops require. It rs remarkable, that in fome parts of this 
parifh, where the foil was firm, and the land lay fheltered 
from the high winds, which prevailed during the fummer of 
that year, and loofened the roots of the con. in expofed pla- 
ces, the oats were found to produce nearly as much meal, in 
1 790, as they ufed to do in the bed feafons ; though the ripen- 
ing could fcarcely be faid to have commenced, till themildwea-

* Some people, thinking they have obferved, that barley, peafe, 
and beans have become lefs fuccefsful, as the culture of artificial 
graffes has become more prevalent, attribute the failure of thefe 
kinds of grain to the introduction of ryv-grafs.

ther came in, which fucc^eded the autumnal equinox. The 
beft oats here produce 8 (tone, Dutch weight, of meal, from 
a boll of the ordinary meafure of the country; one boll and a 
fourth of which, is nearly equal to the F.nglilh quarter of 8 
Winchefter buihtls. The produce of an acre varies greatly, 
according to the foil, the fcafon, and other circumfha- 
. ccs - 

Almoft every hufbandman cultivates potato.? ; not only for 
the ufe of his family, but to feed his horfc:. and cows; for 
which they are found very beneficial. 'there ate dfo good 
many cultivated for i'ale. Artificers, inhabitants ci tv. wn 
and villages, plant potatoes on fpots rented for one year, for 
which they pay at the rate of from L. 4 to L. 0 per acre ; 
and this they drefs at their leifure hours. The cultivation of po- 
tatoes is advantageous. It puts the ground in good order for 
the enfuing crop, whilft an acre, when ready for digging, 
commonly fells at from L. 12 to L. 18. However, much of 
the foil, in this parifh, being rather heavy for that root, the 
culture of it does not fucceed well in very wet, or very dry 
feafons. Befides, every fort of foil here, is injured by repeating 
the culture of potatoes too frequently upon it. The plant itlelf, 
alfo, is of iate frequently infe&amp;ed with a difeafe, particul iry in 
the lower grounds near the town, which proves very injurious. 
After it begins to rife, its leaves contract and fhrLvel, and when 
that part of the ftalk, which is below the earth, is examined, 
a narrow groove, or longitudinal fear, appears corroded, 
through the fine gloffy rind; and, on that part, the pure 
white is tinged with a light ochre colour ; which tinge, when 
the djfeafe goes to a great height, is afterwards communicated 
to the new roots. When thofe fymptoms appear, though the 
plant proceeds to produce flowers and apples, its growth is 
.ftunted, and fooner over than that of a healthy plant; and, 
when the difeafe is violent, the roots which it produces, are

few in number, fniall in fize, aril not pleafant to the tafte. 
This difeafe is not mentioned here, as fuppofing it peculiar to 
the pariihj which is the fubjett of this description : For it 
feems, that it has been Severely felt in many other ^arts in 
Britain, and has occafioned various diflertations, none of which 
are faid to be Satisfactory. But, as it is believed, that it was ob- 
ferved to make its appearance about this town, before it was 
known any where in the country immediately around it ; and, 
as it is an important article in the natural hiftory of this mod; 
valuable root, which has not yet been fully inveftigated ; this 
hint may not be improper to excite more accurate inquiries con- 
concerning its caufe and cure *. 

The 

* This difeafe firft made its appearance in the neighbourhood 
of Hamilton, about the year 1770, or 1 77 1, and has Since been 
gradually gaining ground, infomuch that people have fometimee 
almoft intirely loft their crops, without knowing how that lofs 
could have been prevented. Many contradictory caufes have been 
affigned for this extraordinary phenomenon, all of them, perhaps, 
conjectural. The moft popular and plaufible, is, that the root 
degenerates by being too long planted in a country, widely diffe- 
rent from its native foil and climate ; and, that to prevent this evil, 
it ought to be renovated, by obtaining new ones from the feed 
contained in the apple. But waving all fpeculative reafoning on 
the fubjeft, one plain fact is a fufficient objection to that hypothe- 
cs ; namely, that the difeafe never made its appearance till after 
thofe renovated potatoes were introduced, and has increafed as 
they have been multiplied. It muft, neverthelefs, be acknowledg- 
ed that raifing new potatoes from the apple for feed has been of" 
co"-. derable fervice. They become fit to be discriminated, and 
cut into fets for feed the fecond year; and, when proper -kinds are 
chofen, and the other varieties, with which they are always accom- 

panied,

The culture of carrot, turnips, and cabbage, is fcarcely 
praclifed here, except in gardens. 

Red, white, and yellow clover, rye-grafs, ribwort, &amp;c. 
aTe cultivated here, for hay and palture, and no perfon now 

lay, 

prnicd, rejected, they generally prove very fruitful for fome 
ytars. 

Whatever may be the caufe of this difeafe, nothing can be dis- 
covered in the parent root to give any indication of its being lodged 
there, nor does it appear, in fact, to proceed from it. The brown 
fear, above mentioned, breaks out always near the furface of the 
earth, and is frequently three inches above the original root ; be- 
fides, a healthy plant, and a difeafed one, have been frequently 
found to fpring from contiguous eyes in the middle of the fame po- 
tatoe ; and fometimes both a healthy, and a difeafed one from the 
fame eye : Yet the producing germ feems to be in fome manner 
contaminated ; for, potatoes, from different ftalks planted at the 
fame time, in one field, and undergoing the fame treatment, one of 
them will produce healthy, and the other curled plants ; and when 
the difeafe once appears among potatoes, if part of their produce is 
ufed for feed, in the fubfequent feafon, a greater proportion of the 
plants will be infected every year, though thofe, fprung from dif- 
eafed plants, have been reje&amp;ed. 

The difeafe firft made its appearance in rich ground, manured 
with offals from the town ; aad even potatoes, which prove healthy/ 
on fuch land one year, are frequently much difeafed, though plan- 
ted on other land, the year following. 

Thpugh the difeafe has fpread much fince its firft appearance, it 
has been confined to low lying lands, and has not yet reached any 
place, in this part of the country, which lies more than 350 feet a- 
bove the level of the fea ; nor are plants fprung from potatoes 
which grow in fuch places, fubject to it, even in the low ground 
for a year or two. Since this has been difcovered, it has pront o the

lays down land to reft, without fowing the feeds of fome of 
thefe plants upon it. The produce of hay is from one to three 
.tons per acre, beGdes an after growth, which is generally paf- 
tured on, or cut for green food, the autumn being feldom fa- 
vourable for making it into hay. But red clover never continues 
vigorous in the ground, for more than two years at the utmoft. 
Of late, rye-grafs frequently dies after producing one crop, 
and the other plants, above mentioned, diminifh in fize; fo that 
after one crop of hay, the land is generally ufed in pafture. 
The management of the dairy is fcarcely brought to fuch per- 
fection here, as in fome parifhes to the weft ward ; but there 
are people who make cheefe and butter of a very good quality, 
and the produce of a cow, well managed in that way, will 
yield about L. 4 fey annum. The profits on fattening are 
fluctuating, and depend on the rife and fall of the markets 
for lean and fat cattle : but fattening, being attended with lefs 
trouble andexpence than the conduct of the dairy, is preferred 
by fome people, and, upon the whole, is frequently full as ad- 
vantageous. It is farther to be obferved, that graziers here 
give a higher rent for pafture, when they are at liberty to feed 
black cattle upon it, than when they are confined topafture it 
with fheep. 

Little flax is fown, except for private ufe. At times, fome 
people have made greater adventures, and put in for the pre- 
miums offered by the Truftees, not always without fuccefs : 
But the care and attention, requifite to make the culture of 
flax advantageous, have never been regularly purfued in this 
parifh. Some of the farmers formerly fowed a little hemp, 
which they afterwards made into ropes for domeftic ufe ; but 
their time being now taken up with other articles, that prac- 
tice is laid afide. f 

The modes of cultivation, and rotation of crops, are lo vari- 
ous, that it is impoflible to give any idea of the average quantity 

ef 



of Hamilton. 



of land, applied to any particular purpofe. For the likeres- 
fons, it is equally difficult to afcertain the average amount of 
the annual produce. When, from the viciflirudes which oc- 
cur in human affairs, old paltures are converted into tillage, 
the quant'. y of grain raifed is, neceflarily, more abundant for 
a time ; but it is believed, that, in general, the produce of 
the parifh will fcarcely yeild one half of its annual confump- 
tion. 

Some farmers have got different kinds of new invented 
ploughs, and have them occafionally drawn by two horfes, and 
worked by a plowman without an affiilant. But the Scots 
plough, drawn by three or four horfes, is the molt common. 
Some improvements have been lately made upon it ; and when 
a greater or lefler number of horfts are yoked, aSfherefiftancc 
may require, it is found to make excellent work, and to fuit all 
thevarious purpofes of hufbandry equally well, and, according to 
fome, rather better than any other. A good deal of land here is 
dug with the fpade. This is done for 25 or 26s per acre ; and, 
when the work is properly done, the crop is found fully to an- 
fwer the additional expence. 

The cultivation of the orchard has not been carried to fuch 
a length, nor, perhaps, been fo fuccefsful, as in fome of the 
neighbouring pariflies. Probably both the bottom and the ex- 
pofure are lefs favourable. However, there are a good many 
little orchards in the lower parts, producing apples, pears, 
plumbs, and cherries. In good feafons, they bear very good 
and well -flavoured fruit ; but, upon the whole, this is a very 
precarious article of produce, fubjecl to many injuries from 
fpring-frofts, the depredations of caterpillars, fummer's 
blights, &amp;c. fo that there is fcarcely one year in three, in which 
the orchards turn to good account. The feafons, of late, 
have been particularly unfavourable. Confiderable quantities

of goofe -berries and currants, produced here, are fent to the 
Glafgow market. 

Foreft trees, of all kinds, capable of {landing the climate 
of Scotland, thrive in the lower parts of the parifli. Some of 
them attain to a great fize. On poor land, in high expofures, 
the larix, fince it has been introduced, has thriven better 
than any other. Next to it, is the Scots fir. Scarcely any 0- 
tlier kind of wood has fucceeded in the high ground except 
the birch. At the fame time, the beech, the alh, and the 
plane, will Hand the fevereft expofure, when they have a fuf- 
ficient depth of dry foil. 

It has been already fhted, that the parifli is moftly inclofed, 
that is to fay, the fields are in general furrounded with earthen 
mounds dug out of a trench, in the face of which, a row of 
white thorn has been planted : But it is a rare tlung, excepting 
in the befl foils and moft flickered places, to find the length 
ef fifty yards together of fufficient fence, and in many places 
tltere are not ten yards in fifty. The thornsj when the foil, in 
which they are planted, is in any degree tolerable, make 
moots for a few years ; but the bank of hard unproductive 
earth, to which they are confined, affording them little nou- 
rifhment, and, at the fame time, fecluding them from the be- 
neficial influences of the fun and air, they become Runted, 
and, at length, are fmothered up, in many places, with a 
coat of fliaggy gray mofs growing all over them. The defi- 
ciency requires to be perpetually made up by repeated fupplies 
of dead fence. Much of the under foil in this parifh is, no 
doubt, unfriendly to the growth of quickfet hedges, but pro- 
bably the manner of planting is not lefs unfavourable. Hed- 
ges planted on the top of a bank, of the befc foil, gathered from 
♦he furface, generally fucceed better, and it is only in that 
fhuation, that quickfet hedges continue to be permanent 
2 fenceSa

fences, where the foil is thin, and the bottom retentive of 
water. 

Upon the whole, this parifh is rather a beautiful than a fer- 
tile country, and cultivation has been more fuccefsful in en- 
riching the fcenery, than in multiplying the armual produc- 
tions. Not that the land is incapable of improvement : for 
there are feveral fpots, particularly fuch as have been in the 
pofleffion of fmall proprietors, which have been rendered 
more than doubly productive, in the courfe of the laft thirty 
years. Nor are the hufbandmen deficient in induftry, or a 
difpofition to labour :' But a variety of adverfe contingencies 
has difappointed the good effects, which fuch difpofitions 
might have produced. Villages have been demolifhed, and 
land, which formerly gave fufEcient employment to three 
or four families, has been put into the poffeffion of one man. 
Rents have been raifed, in fome inftances, beyond what the 
ability of the tenants could pay, who have thus been made 
bankrupt, driven from their farms, and fucceeded by others, 
no better qualified than the former pofi'efTors. From thefe and 
other circumftances, which would take too much time here to 
enumerate, agricultural (lock has been diffipated, and the num- 
bers, the energy and enterprifc of hufbandmen neceffarily 
diminifhed. Thus, the improvement of a country, which, 
from the nature of its foil and climate, requires the moft vigo- 
rous exertions, and the moft vigilant attention to cultivate 
it to the beft advantage, has been greatly impeded. 

The-rent of land, at a diftance from the town, let in Ieafe 
for 19 years, is from 5 or 6s to a guinea per acre. Good land, 
near the town, is let from L. 3 to L, 5 -, and there are inftan- 
ces of rich land, which had been long in pafture or highly ma- 
nured, being let, for a fhort fpace of time, from L. 5 to L. 8, 
for raifing wheat and other grains.

i^Tr.—— -Coal is found in this parilh, as well as in all the 
neighbouring country, and ftill continues to be wrought in the 
Duke of Hamilton's property. But the greateft part of the coal, 
confumed here, is brought from the neighbouring parilhes, and 
is delivered at the town for about 5s per ton. Thirty years ago, 
it was not above half that price. Lime abounds! in| the upper 
part of the parifli ; and in one place, has been wrought for a 
century paft. In the lime-works are found, bivalvular and 
fpiral (hells, refembling fmall fea (hells; and, in a thin 
bed of clay, which is fometimes found abovekhe lime, there are 
many of thefe fhells, fome of them fo minute, as fcarccly to 
be difcerned by the naked eye. Bits of fmall petrified flicks 
are alfo found above the lime, fo hard as to ftrike fire ; and 
yet the component parts fo diftin£tly preferved, that the bark, 
the different years growth of the wood, and the pith, can be 
eafily diftinguifhed. Free-ftone, moftly foft, and of a reddifh 
colour, abounds almoft every where ; but in fome places it is 
white and firm. — The higheft land in the fouth-weft part of the 
parilh, has a great ridge of whin ftone rock. Iron ftone is fre- 
quently to be met with ; and the water of different fprings is 
ftrongly tinctured with the ore of that metal ; but none of 
thefe have obtained any great degree of fame in the cure of 
difeafes. There are feveral petrifying or encrufting fprings, 
iffuing from the rocks i which, when they fall upon mofs, 
make an encruftation around its filaments, and form thofe fan.- 
taftic figures which are kept in the cabinets of the curious. 
Beds of fullers' and potters' earth are found in different places ; 
and, in one part, a very pure yellow ochre, in confiderable 
quantities. 

Population. From a minute enumeration of the inhabi- 
tants, taken in 1791, it appear*} there are 954 families 

in

Total fouls in the parlih 

There are about 48 farmers in the parilh, befides a number 
of occupiers of fmall fpots, many of whom have fome other 
employment, and above 42 perfons employed in the coal and 
lime-works. 

The people here are very inattentive to the regiftering of 
theit children's births, fo that no authentic information can be 
obtained refpecting that fubje£t : But the number of marria- 
ges is better afcertained, amounting, at an average of the laft 
three years, to 36. By an account of deaths, kept by the parifh 
grave-digger, the mortality for the three laft years, is as fol-

lows: In 17B8, — 91, in 1789, — 120, and irt 1 790, (which 
was a year uncommonly fatal, an epidemical nervous fever hav- 
ing raged for fome months,) 167. The annual average of 
thefe three years, is 126, to which, about 10 muft be added, 
fuppofed to be carried annually to other burying grounds, 
making in all 136; fo that, about 1 in 37 die yearly. 

The only enumeration of the parifh at any former period, 
whieh can now be traced, is that tranfmitted to Dr Webfter, 
about the year 1755, which makes the number of fouls at that 
time 3815. Hence, the increafe of population in the laft 40 
years, is 1202. It is probable, that this is the real progreflive 
ftate of the population of this diftricX There is no doubt, 
that'ithe numbers, in the country part of the parifh, have dimi- 
nifhed confiderably fince that period : for, though new houfes 
have been built in feveral places, yet there were then four or 
five villages, containing a good number of inhabitants, in 
which, there now are very few. The town, however, has 
greatly increafed, particularly of late. An exact lift of all the 
families in it, was taken in the year 1782, and amounted only 
to 805, and, fuppofing the average number in each family to 
be in the fame proportion as at prefent, (little more than 3!,) 
the increafe in the laft nine years, is about 564, and in that 
time, the country part of the parifh has continued nearly the 
fame. 

It will be obvious, that there is a confiderable change of the 
ftate of the place, by taking a comparative view of it at diffe- 
rent periods. Thirty years ago, there were not more than 9 
or 10 carpenters and joiners of all kinds in the parifh, and fome 
of thefe, at times, not very well employed. There are now 
about 58 in the town of Hamilton, alone. Three or four bak- 
ers baked all the bread for this, and the neighbouring pariflies: 
There are now 1 8 bakers, mafters and affiftants, in this place, 
befides many ovens and bakers in the neighbourhood. At the 

firft 



of Hamilton. 197 

firfl period there were not more than 250 weavers' looms in the 
parifli : there are now 450. Thefe, without carrying the com- 
parifon farther, will evidently Ihow a confiderable incrcafe of 
population and induftry. 

There are 5 practitioners of medicine in the town; and fix at 
torneys ; three common brewers ; and one diililler, who con- 
fumes much more grain than all the brewers. All of them obtain 
the greater part of their materials from other diftricts. There is 
no lefs a number, than 66 houfes for retailing liquors, befides 
thofe which are unlicenfed. 

Manufafturcs When induftry began to flourifh in Scot- 
land, it was generally expected that Hamilton, from the exer- 
tions, which the inhabitants had already made in all the 
branches of domeftic induftry, — from the plenty and cheap- 
nefs of fuel, — from its fine ftreams of water, — from its eafy 
communication with all the neighbouring diftricts, — from its 
vicinity to Glafgow, on the one hand, mid an extenfive corn 
country, on the other ; — and its exemption from the difturb- 
ances of election politics, wouldhave made great progrefsin ma- 
nufactures. It has, however, fallen far fhort of thefe expedi- 
tions. Paifley and Kilmarnock, which, fifty years ago, were not 
more confiderable, and are not poflclled of any vifible fuperio- 
vity in regard to local advantages, have now become large opu- 
lent towns, while this place ftill continues comparatively incon- 
fiderable. The people, however, are occupied in manufactures 
of various kinds. All kinds of cabinet and carpenter work are 
executed here, not only for the ufe of the inhabitants, but for 
others at a confiderable diftance. The tanning and dreffing of 
leather is carried on to a confiderable extent ; and great quanti- 
ties of Ikins, for that manufacture, are brought from Glafgow, 
■ind even from Ireland*. A good deal of dreffed leather is now 
lent to London, whence formerly much of what was ufed here 



19 8 Stati/lical Account 

was brought. Saddlery is carried on to fome extent. There Is al- 
io a great manufacture for fhoes, and 120 fhoemakers are em- 
ployed in it ; who, befides making that article for the people 
in the neighbourhood, manufacture different kinds for expor- 
tation. The candles made here, have long had a great charac- 
ter ; and one family in particular, has carried on thatbufinefs 
with reputation and fuccefs, for four fucceffive generations. 

But the principal manufacture it weaving, which has 

long been followed here to fome extent/and has of late greatly 
increafed. Befides the looms above mentioned, there are 24 
(locking frames ; chiefly employed by the Glafgow manufac- 
turers. A fmall manufacture of thread lace has long been car- 
ried on here. At an early period, it was the occupation 
cf a good many women ; but, from the fluctuation of fafhion, 
it had fallen greatly into difufe. Fafhion again revived the 
demand ; and the late Duchefs of Hamilton, afterwards of 
Argyle, found (till fome lace-workers remaining, to whom 
her own demand, and that of thofe who followed her example, 
gave employment. To thefe, her Grace added 12 orphan 
girls, who were cloathed, maintained, and taught at her ex- 
pence. Others learned the art ; and, while the demand lafl 
ed, the manufacture employed a good many hands. Though 
the number is again diminifhed, there are ftill above 40 at the 
bufinefs, who make handfome laces of different patterns, be- 
fides thofe who work occafionally for themfelves, or their 
friends. Perhaps, under the patronage of the prefent refpec- 
table Duchefs, the manufacture of Hamilton lace may again 
become as flourifhing as ever. But the principal employment 
of the women of this parifh has long been the fpinning of 
linen yarn; packs of which were collected and fent to England, 
about the beginning of this century, befides what was made into 
cloth at home. So late as the year 1 7 50, large parcels of yarn 
were fent from Hamilton to the north of Ireland : but the Irifh 

have

199 



have fmce learned to make good yarn, to fupply their own de- 
mands ; and the manufacture at home has confumed all the 
yarn, made in this neighbourhood. 

The (late of manufactures has, of late, undergone confide- 
rable alterations. Formerly, almoft all the weavers manu- 
factured linen only, and either employed themfclves, or de- 
rived their employment from others on the fpot. Now they get 
employment from the great manufacturers in Glafgow, &amp;c. and 
cotton yarn is the principal material. Young women, who 
were formerly put to the fpinning-wheel, now learn to flower 
muflin, and apply to the agents of the fame manufacturers for 
employment. On the other hand, the greateft number of the 
(hoe-makers formerly derived their employment from the 
Glafgow manufacturers : Whereas now the fhoe-makers of 
this, and great numbers in the neighbouring pariihes, are em- 
ployed by dealers in this town. Some people here arc now 
beginning to attempt the manufacture of thread. 

Chorafter The people of this place have long had the 

character of being affable, courteous, and humane ; and arc 
diftinguifhedfor eafy, fociable, and accommodating manners. 
But the moft leading feature in their general character, is t 
kind of fportive humour, breaking out in little faliies of fancy, 
as often as opportunities occur. This has frequently fliown 
itfelf in whimfical rhymes, fquibs and pafqumades on all occa- 
fions; in giving people additional names, adapted to their 
difpofitions, or fome remarkable occurrence in their lives, and 
in conteft for fuperiority in converfation, and repartee. They 
are alfo faid to have been rather addicted to the plcafures of 
the bottle. The manners of the people, upon the whole, 
however, long continued to be decent and refpectable. Mo- 
ral or intellectual delinquency were the objects, at which ridi- 
cule was generally pointed, their moft ufual beverage was 

a 



100

a lively malt liquor, of moderate flrength ; which was thought 
to be well made here, as long as the nature of the excife permit- 
ted it. Their convivial meetings, were, of courfe, rarely attend- 
ed with riot, or extravagant debauch. The better fort retained a 
rcfpecl: for order and propriety ; the inferior ranks were fub- 
miflive to authority, and refpeclful to their fuperiors •, an ef- 
teem fsr virtue, a juft regard to the peace and property of o~ 
thers, and an unambitious contented fpirit, generally prevail- 
ed. The beautiful tints of this pleafing picture are now fcme- 
what defaced. Decency is too often the butt of fcorn ; and ic 
is the belt zeft of a frolic, that it is attended with mifchief to 
the inoffenfive. Whifky, which inflames its votaries w ith fu- 
ry, or debafes them into the grcfleft flupidity, is become n 
common beverage j and people too often forget every fenfe of 
duty, when indulging the bewitching draught. Even women cf 
the lower ranks arc not afhamed, as often as they have an op- 
portunity, to drink it to intoxication. The changes in the 
ftate of our manufactures, which have been above adverted 
to, having removed the intermediate gradations in the fcaleof 
fociety, operative people, deprived of the profpe£t of advan- 
cing a llep higher, have loft that incentive to economy andin- 
duftry : nor has the eye of the employer, at a diftance, and 
almoft unknown, any influence as a reftrtHnt on their behavi- 
our. The young artizan, having hnifhed his fhort appentice* 
■{hip, finds himfelf mafter of his conduft and of his earnings 
before he has attained difcretion to manage them ; and, yield- 
ing to bad example, unthinkingly plunges into folly and difh- 
pation. Thus are the focial and domeftic duties too often ne- 
glected, by thofe, whofe exiftence depends upon their applica- 
tion to labour. Habits cf lazinefs gain ground ; and a day of 
j*i!enefs or riot is fometimes clofed by a night, either employ- 
ed in wanton milthief, or in fupplying the deficiency of in*

Juftry by pillage ; fo that no kind of property, which is neccf- 
farily expofed to depredation, i3 any longer fafe. 

Amidft this general diflblution of manners, the people of 
Hamilton may be rather faid to be deficient in virtue, than de- 
termined in vice. Their irregularities appear rather to pro- 
ceed from thoughtlefsnefs, than confirmed depravity. Some 
traces of their antient humanity may be ftill difcovered on dif- 
ferent occafions. Though petty breaches of juftice and good 
order are frequent, atrocious deeds of cruelty and wiekednefs 
are not known. In the courfe of forty years, no perfon has 
been accufed of murder : Robbery and houfe-breaking have 
very feldom beeu committed ; and there is no inftance of any 
individual, during his refidence in the parifli, having been con- 
victed of fuch crimes. Much has been faid of the happy influ- 
ence of Sunday fchools in other places. If there were people 
of wealth and influence heartily difpofed to ftrengthen virtue, 
to encourage good behaviour, and to difcounttnance vice and 
irregularity, by cftablifhing that inftitution here, in order to 
refcue the children of diffolute parents, from the danger of bad 
habits, to irftrucT: them in the principles of religion, and a 
courfe of fobriety and induftry, it is probable, they might be 
the happy means of reftoring and improving the morals of all 
Vhe people in this populous diltrict. 

The young men of this parifh have always fhown a great ar- 
dour for a military life. A popular recruiting officer never 
comes to the place, in time of war, without making great le- 
vies. In the year 1778, above fixty enlifted in the regiment 
raifed by the Duke of Hamilton, befides fome who entered with 
other corps. The women have fhown little lefs cagernefs to 
follow the camp, a good many always going off, with every par- 
ty of the military, who have been quartered here.

mory is fo much and fo juftly celebrated, was born here ; and 
received the firft part of his education under Mr Brifbane, at 
the grammar fchool of this town. There are people here, 
who remember him at fchool ; and faw him in girls clothes, 
acting the part of a fhepherdefs, in a Latin paftoral. Here he 
alfo fettled for fometime as a furgeon ; and was chofen one of 
the magistrates. Captain James Gilchrift, of the navy, who 
was defervedly accounted one of the braveft, and moft fkilful 
naval officers, that ever Great Britain faw, was alfo born in 
this parifh; and being at length difabled by a wound, which he 
received, bravely fighting in the caufe of his country, fpent ' 
the latter part of his life, in the improvement of his property in 
this neighbourhood. Nor ought Mr John Miller, now pro- 
fefibr of law in the Univerfity of Glafgow, to be omitted, 
whofe abilities as a teacher, and whofe merit as an author, are 
fo well known to the public. 

Ecclefiajlical State. The Duke of Hamilton is patron. — 

There are two minifters. To the firfl charge is annexed, a 
ftipend of 8 chalders of victual, and L. 41 : 13 -.4 in money, 
befides L. 20 for the glebe, (which is now included in the 
Duke of Hamilton's pleafure ground,) and, a certain fum an- 
nually by way of rent for the minilter's hcufe and garden, there 
being no manfe built. The fecond living is 6 chalders of 
meal, and L. 33 : 6:8 in money, with a free houfe and gir- 
den ; but there is no glebe attached to it. The diilenters are 
pretty numerous. The moft populous feci: is that of the Re- 
lief ; who pay their clergyman about L. 100 a year. There 
are, under his miniftry, about 874 perfons of all ages belong- 
ing to this pariffi. The Antiburgher congregation is more 
widely difperfed, the circumftances of the people lefs affluent, 
and the provifion of the clergyman more fcanty. There are

250 people of this parifh, arrived to the years of discretion, 
who join him. The Macmillan feci, who profefs an adherence to 
the pure tenets of the Prefbyterian reformed religion, as efta- 
blifhed in Scotland in the time of Charles I. have upwards of 
60 in this pavifh, who attend a meeting houfe in the neigh- 
bourhood. The Independents, who maintain an affecYionate 
brotherhood together, and difpenfe religious ordinances gra- 
tuitoufly by turns, without the ceremony of clerical invefti- 
ture, have a fociety confift ing of nearly 50, and a large room 
in the town, properly fitted up for performing divine ferviee. 
There are three Anabaptifts. All the reft of the inhabitants 
are either of the Eftablifhed church, or attach themfelves to 
no particular fe£t. 

Schools. There is a large hall for a grammar fchool ; 

which has had, for a long time paft, a good reputation ; and, 
befides the youth of the place, a great many boarders from a 
diftance, have been educated at it. About 22 years ago, ano- 
ther fchool-mafter was eftablifhed to teach Englifh, writing, 
arithmetic, &amp;c. to whofe falary the emoluments of precentor 
and feffion-clerk have been added ; together with the intereft 
of L. 100, left by Mr James Naifmith, for the education of 
poor children in the parifh. Ann, Duchefs of Hamilton, in the 
beginning of this century, mortified 2000 merks Scots, under 
the management of the church feffion, for four fmall falaries to 
fehool-mafters, in the diftant villages of the parifh. Two of 
thefe are ftill continued : the reft, from the decay of the vil- 
lages, are dropt, and the money applied to other pious ufes. 
Befides thefe, there are always feveral private fchools ; th$ 
teachers of which, have no other income, but the emoluments 
from their refpe&amp;ive fcholars.

and there are aifo feveral indigent perfons, who receive week- 
ly penfions from the fame quarter. 

About the year 1750, the inhabitants, in order to put a 
flop to begging, and to give more regular relief to the modeft 
poor, aflefled themfelves in the payment of annual poors rates, 
the amount of which Was then about L. ico. With this, 
and the other funds, all the poor, (then upwards of 50,) 
were decently fupported, and begging, for a time, ftri&amp;ly 
prohibited. — Towards the year 1770, the number of poor 011 
the lift was 79, and the annual amount of the rates L. 16:. 
Claimants for public charity, however, becoming flill mors 
numerous, and more clamorous, the lift was afterwards in- 
creafed to 1 15, and the annual rates to L. 230. But the he- 
ritors and church feflion, who adminifter thefe funds, alarm- 
ed at the growing burden, have become more cautious of admit- 
ting people on the lift, and the poors rates are now reduced to 
ibout L. 200. 

Befides the common funds, for the fupport of the poor, 
there are ten charitable focieties, formed by people of different 
occupations and profeffions, for the relief of any of their re- 
fpeclive members, who may fall into diftrefs. The rr.oft im- 
portant of thefe are the weavers ; who compofe two focieties, 
called the old and the new box. Thefe have been of confide- 
rable fervicc, particularly the laft, which has eftablifhed very 
wife regulations, for the management of its funds and gives 
to each of its members, while on a bed of ficknefs, 3s week- 
ly, and when in a ftate of convalefcence, but unable to work,

quently and very properly obferved, refpe£ting the many be-

and to individuals, if fuch focieties were more univerfal. To be

adverfity of fiiends and neighbours, but as, a pro'vifion ags'infi 1 
the day of affliction, which too furely awaits the contributor 
Iiimfc'.f, muft certainly give the moft pleafing reflections, and 
tend greatly to cheriih that honeft pride and manly indepen- 
dence of mind, which enables people to be ufeful in the low- 
eft ftations, and to ftrr.ggie fuccefsfully with all the various 
difficulties of human life. This too, would be a proper field 
for the rich and the benevolent to exercife their charity. 
Their bounty, thus beftowed, would alleviate the diftrefs, and 
•would promote the comfort of the moft ufeful members of fo- 
cie-ty, without debafing them into the abjecl: condition of beg- 
gars. It is a melancholy confideration, therefore, that thofe 
affociations are fo much disregarded. Of all the weavers in 
this parifh, there are only 60 contributors to the firft of the 
above mentioned boxes, and 120 to the fecond, fome of whom 
are contributors to both, and fome not really of the profeffion. 
The greateft part of the reft, either wafte away their time in 
idlenefs, or fpend their earnings in drinking, thoughtlefs of 
the evil day, and regardlefs of futurity. 

Hence, notwithftanding all the provifions for the poor, to 
which, if the alms privately beftowed, were added, the fum 
would exceed L. 500 a year, the condidon of many of them is 
very wretched ; and the demands, upon the public charity, 
v.re always greater than it can fatisfy. When the people once 
come to admit, that the fruits of their induftry are unequal to 
their wants, they are difpofed to lay it afide entirely ; and eve- 
ry one, aggravating his own diftreffes, thinks himfelf en- 
titled to a larger fhare of the public funds than another, and is 
proportionally importunate for affiftance. The great misfor- 
tune is, that their economy too often relaxes along with their 
induftry ; and the poor pittance beftowed for providing necef- 
faries, is laid out in the only luxury within their reach. The 
plenty and the cheapnefs of whifky, and the great number of

lioufes allowed to retail it, is an irrefiftible temptation to people 
of this description, and confumes a considerable part of the 
weekly charity. What a fatal policy is it not in any govern- 
ment, to encourage a manufacture fo peculiarly deltruclivc, 
for the fake of converting a (mail proportion of the profit de- 
rived from it, into revenue ? . 

Such difpofitions among the lower, ranks occafion alio a 
great many beggars, who ftroll about exacting contributions 
frqm the companion of individuals, their demands not being Sa- 
tisfied in the diftribution of the charitable funds. But the num- 
ber of beggars, belonging to this pavifh, is trifling, eomparecTto 
the crowds of vagrants of every defcription, who fwarm from 
the populous towns around, and Spread over the country, beg- 
ging, cheating, fwindling, or ftealing, as bed fuits their pur- 
pofe. And here, as in other places, they have feveral infa- 
mous haunts, to which they refort for lodging, difpofe of 
their booty, and fpend their finifter gettings in the grofiefl: 
riot and debauch: and, as foon as theSe are cxhaufted, they a- 
gain ilTue forth to practice every art upon the public, which 
unprincipled ingenuity, Stimulated by want, can devife. 
How worthy would it not be of the generous exertions of pa- 
triotic Spirits, to find means of reftraining thefe infidious depre- 
dations, and turning the activity and addrels of vagrants to 
more innocent and ufeful purpofes ! 

State of Properly. — The whole valued rent of this parifti, is 
L.9377 Scots. The Duke of Hamilton is proprietor of more 
than the half, and the remainder is held of him in feu. There 
are nine proprietors of eflates, from L. 400 to L. 100 of valu- 
ed rent, — twenty from L. 100 to L. 20, — and a good many 
Smaller properties. The Duke has his principal refidence here ;

already mentioned, the veftiges of a few others are ft 111 to be 
feen in the parifn, probably the feats of fome of the leffer ba- 
rons, in the middle ages ; but tradition has not handed down 
any thing refpe&amp;ing them, which deferves to be recorded. 
Near the middle of the parifh, is a Roman tumulus, which 
has been of confiderable extent. About 20 years ago, one fide, 
of it was broken into, and a good many urns found, contain- 
ing the afhes of human bones, fome them accompanied with 
the tooth of a horfe. There was no infcription feen ; but 
fome of the urns, which were all of baked earth, were plain, 
others decorated with moulding, probably to diftinguifh the 
quality of the deceaft. The old oaks in the Duke of Hamil- 
ton's park, have always been regarded as a curiofity. They 
have, no doubt, been very majeftic trees, fome of themmea- 
furing upwards of 27 feet round. They flood irregularly at a 
confiderable diftance from one another, covering a confidera- 
ble extent of pretty plain ground ; and feem to be the laft re- 
mains of thofe antient forefts, which, in former times, over- 
fpread. the country. They have been much diminifhed in 
point of number, in the courfe of the prefent century •, many 
of them having been cut, many having fallen down, and ma- 
ny of thofe that remain, having loft their tops and fine fpread- 
ing boughs, are now only mutilated trunks, covered with 
fhort fcrubby branches, ftill exhibiting the melancholy remains 
of their former grandeur. Among thefe venerable trees, graz- 
ed the wild cows, mentioned by naturalifts as an untamed na- 
tive breed. They feemed to differ in nothing from the domef- 
tic kind, excepting that they were all over white, with black 
or brown ears and muzzles ; and, from their manner of life, 
very fhy, and even fierce, when they had not room to fly. They 
were exterminated, from economical motives, about the year 
3760. Here, alio, the Duke of Hamilton has a park well

{locked with fallow deer. Barncluith, a pleafant little fpot 

upon the bank of Avon, at a north corner of the Duke's great 
park, has been much reforted to by ftrangers. It is a houfe 
on the top of a bold bank, with terrace walks cut out of the 
rock, one imder another, dcfcending towards the river, fup« 
ported by high walls, covered with fruit trees of different 
kinds. Evergreens of various fhapes ftood along thefe walks. 
On favourable points were built little handfome pavilions ; and 
a jett d'eau, in the middle of a bafon, fpouted the water to a 
confiderable height. This fpot commanded the profpeft of the 
fine wooded banks of Avon, rifing like a vaft amphitheatre, 
with here and there fome prominent rocky cliffs, pufliing out 
their bold heads, the tops of the antient oaks, fome beautiful 
peeps into the open fields, and the water rolling below ; fo 
that every change of place furniftied the view of new and de- 
lightful obje£ls. Thefe works are now fallen greatly into de- 
cay ; and the tafte for this artificial fpecies of gardening hav- 
ing become lefs fafhionable, the place is not now held in fo 
much repute. But while the proprietor, who planned and ex- 
ecuted them, is remembered, the fpot will always be regarded 
with refpeft. He was of the family of the Hamiltons of 
Pancaitland, a very ftudious and learned man, particularly a 
great adept in mathematics, and the curious mechanic arts ; 
and, at the fame time, a man of great benevolence of heart, 
lie isfaid to have executed the works above mentioned, prin- 
cipally with a view to give bread to the poor, in the time of 
the famine, which happened towards the end of the lalt cen- 
tury The old church, which ftood hard by the palace, 

was a venerable Gothic pile, fome parts of which were highly 
ornamented in that tafle. It is now all pulled down, except 

the aifle, which covers the family burying vault. "Where 

the lower part of the town formerly ftood, is a fquare column 
of ftone, about fix feet high, very rudely cut, without either

date or infcription, having only upon the fide of it a number of 
circles, infcribed within one another, of a very rough fculpture. 
It was probably fet up in the antient market place, as a badge 
of municipal jurifdidtion. Of the fame nature, was a tall 
wooden poft, with two crofs arms affixed to it, and an iron 
collar, for encircling the necks of offenders, called the Jougs, 
fufpended by a chain at the fide of it, which ftood on a ftone 
pedeftal in a public part of the prefent town *. It was called 
the Trette, and goods fold in the public market were weighed 
at it. It was taken down about ten years ago, being thought 
an incumbrance on the ftreet. 

Mijidlaneous Remarks. — The Scottifh dialed} is fpoken heie 
with very little provincial peculiarity. The names of mod pla- 
ces are derived from that language*, but a few have a Celtic o- 
r:gin 5 fuch as Earnock or Eanwgg, the old Ton's poffeffion, 
Dam galer, the houfe or village between the waters, &amp;c. — 
The wild quadrupeds here are the fame as in the neighbouring 
country ; neither are there any uncommon birds. Eagles are 
fddom feen. Rooks abound greatly, and are very injurious 
to the hufbandman. It may be obferved, that the bulfinch, 
which is faid to be a new bird in Scotland, is known to have 
hatched in this parifh, more than forty years ago. The wood- 
lark is frequent in this part of the country. On the approach 
of mow, great flocks of fmall birds of the migratory lpecies, 
and of vaft variety of plumage, fpread over the fields. They 
are here called fnyw-jlights ; and are faid to come from the 
Orkneys. It has been obferved, that, in blowing weather, in 
fpring and autumn, great quantities of gulls pafs this way to 
the wcftward, but have never been feen to go eaft by the fame 
rout. 

Glafgow

of Hamilton. 



ill 



Glafgow being the great mart in this country, fervants wa- 
ges, the price of labour, and the value of provifions, &amp;c. Sec. 
are regulated, throughout the country by the rates there. From 
the nature of circumftances, many things are a little lower 
here ; but people being always eager to refort to the bell mar- 
ket, it is generally belt fupplied, and prices are often cheaper 
at Glafgow. 

The two principal roads, through this parifh, were made and 
are upheld by turnpikes. They are generally kept in pretty 
good order ; though, from the foftnefs of the foil, and the 
fcarcity of materials, hard enough to ftand the fatigue of the ma- 
ny heavy carriages which pafs, it is attended with considera- 
ble difficulty and expence. Nobody here entertains any doubt 
of the advantage of turnpike roads, fince, at leaft, three times 
as much weight can be drawn in a carriage, as was fufheiene 
to load it before they were made. If any objection can be 
made to the turnpike roads of this country, it is to the manner 
in which they have been laid out, being generally conducted 
over the fummit of every eminence in their courfe ; when 
with a little judgement and attention, a direction might have 
been found equally near, and incomparably more eafy and con- 
venient. 

The crofs roads in this parifh being numerous, and the foil 
foft, many of them are (till in very indifferent repair : but fe- 
veral of the mod frequented have been much improved of late; 
and there is fcarcely a brook in the parifh, which has not a 
bridge over it, where neceflary. 

A commutation in money is now generally levied for the 
ftatutework; but this, according to fome, is a miftaken po- 
licy. If a parifh were divided into fmall diftricts, and each of 
them directed to work, under a proper overfeer, upon the 
road, in which they had moft intereft, the people are be- 
come fo fenfible of the^ advantage of good roads, that ihey 
D d 2 would

would do much more work, it is faid, than can be done with 
the commutation in the hands an undertaker, who propofes to 
make profit by the job. 

But this parifh has ftill the profpecr, of being better accord 
modated with roads. From the new lines going on and pro- 
pofed, — from the fpirit for enterprife and improvement which 
prevails, — from the experience obtained from former errors, 
it is probable, there will foon be eafy and commodious accefs 
in all directions, and the internal commerce of the country 
greatly facilitated and enlarged *. 

* The prefent magistrates of the town, who have been in office 
for feveral years, have been, during their administration, indefati- 
gable in their attention to the improvement of the Streets, which 
are now made as eafy and convenient, as the fituation can poffibly 
-*dmit. </p>

Parish of <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q881708">blantyre</name>. 

(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Henry Steven;^</head> 



<p>Origin cf the Name. 
* J ""HE name of the parifli is evidently exprefTive of its local 
1* fituation. The principal part of it lies on the banks of 
the Clyde, and is furrounded by riling grounds. The lower 
part is but a few feet above the level of the fea, (though it is 
about 30 miles diftant.) From its low flickered fituation, it 
obtained the name of Blantyre, which, in the Gaelic language, 
is faid to fignify a warm retreat. 

Situation and Extent. Blantyre is fituated in the county 

of Lanark, in the prefbytery of Hamilton, and fynod of Glaf- 
gow and Ayr. It is about 6 miles in length ; but, at an ave- 
rage, only about a mile in breadth. From the church, which 
is placed nearly in the middle of the parifli, to the banks of 
the Clyde, the ground is almoft a plain ; divided into fmall 
inclofures, furrounded with beautiful belts of planting. In the 
whole parifli there is neither hill nor mountain. 

«So/7. -The foil is various. Some fields, adjacent to the 
• church) 



Statijlical Account 



church, are a fine rich loam. From the church to the Clyde, 
towards the north-eaft, the foil is in general a ftrong deep 
clay ; and when properly cultivated is exceeding fertile. At 
the northern extremity, which is furrounded by the Clyde, 
and where the banks become low, there is a flat that confifts 
chiefly of a fandy foil. From the church, towards the fouth 
end of the parifh, the foil is clay, but more light and free, 
than that in the lower part ; and is in general of a very poor 
quality. In advancing farther from the church, towards the 
fouthern extremity, the foil becomes gradually mare of a mof- 
fy nature ; and, at laft, terminates in a deep peat mofs. 

Rivers. — Blantyre is bounded on the north, and north-eaft, 
for the extent of about two miles and a half, by the Clyde ; 
which abounds with excellent falmon, trouts, pikes, pars, &amp;c. 
The exclufive privilege of fifhing falmon, belongs to the diffe- 
rent proprietors, whofe lands are contiguous to the river : but 
they are feldom caught in fuch plenty, as to become any great 
object for the market — A confklerable part of the banks are 
covered with wood ; and, from the gentle bendings of the ri- 
ver, they form many beautiful and romantic profpects.— — — 
Clyde is not navigable above Glafgow. 

Mineral Springs. — There is a mineral fpring in this parifh, 
the water of which is frequently and fuccefsfully ufed, for 
fore eyes, fcorbutic diforders, and a variety of other complaints. 
The water is fulphureous ; it is very ftrongly impregnated, 
and is accounted the beft of the kind in this part of the coun- 
try. About fifty years ago, it was the common fummer rtfort 
of many families from Glafgow : but from the changes of fa- 
fhion, fo frequent in relation to fuch objects of medical regi- 
men, i: is now alrnoft totally deferted. 



of Blantyre. 



Iron Mines. — In the banks of Calder-water, which divides 
vhis parifh from Kilbride, there has, of late, been difcovered, 
a vaft quantity of iron ftone, of an excellent quality, which is 
now wrought to great extent. Many different feams of it ap- 
pear on the face of the banks, at the diftance of a few feet 
from each other : and the feams are ufually about 6 or 7 in- 
ches thick. The ftone is dug out, by mines driven forward 
into the bank. It is carried to the diftance of about 7 miles, to 
a furnace erected near Glafgow, and converted into pig iron. 
The iron company ufually pay the proprietors of the land, at 
the rate of 6d per ton, for the iron ftone ; befides making 
compenfation for any damages that may be done in dig- 
ging- 

Figured Stones — Many of thefe iron (tones appear to retain 
the original fhape of the wood, from which, according to the 
opinion of fome naturalifts they have been formed. Some of 
them retain the original form of the branch of an exotic pine ; 
and have rows of fmall protuberances winding round them, in 
an oblique direction; and fome of them are covered with fpines. 
Befides the (tones, which retain the original fhape of the wood, 
there are others, that are only marked with the impreflions of 
die bark. Thefe impreflions are moftly chequered, fome on 
a level, and others on a concave furface, anfwerable to the con- 
vexity of the original trunk or branch ; and thefe impreffions 
on the iron ftone are fometimes very perfect. 

Population. — The ftate of the parifh, with refpect to popula- 
tion, as far as can be traced back, feems to have been nearly, 
for many years, the fame. The return to Dr. Webfter, in 
1755, was 496 fouls. But in 1787, the number of inhabi- 
tants was immediately and greatly increafed, by means of a 
cotton mill erected upon the Clyde. Before that period, the 

number 



216 



Statifticat Account 



number of inhabitants above 8 years old, was about 460. The 
number of families, including every individual who poffeffed a 
feparate lodging, was 130; and, calculating at the rate of 
4 to a family the number of fouls might be about 520. The 
annual average of births, for ten years preceding 1787, was 
17, — of deaths, during the fame period, 1 1, — and of marria- 
ges^. Since the year 1 787, when the cotton mill began to work, 
the population has been making continual and rapid progrefs ; 
and, as the machinery is not nearly completed, they are ftill 
daily increafing. The numbers at the cotton mill were not ex- 
actly afcertained, till the 14th of March, 1791 ; and, at that 
date, they flood as follows : 

Men, women, and children, employed in the mill 295

rims, the number of inhabitants, in the parifh, has been 

doubled, 

* Tliefe children are in general orphans, between 8 and 12 
years of age. They are generally bound to the work by their re- 
lations, for a few years ; and are fed, cloathed, and lodged by the 
proprietor of the mill. He has a fchool mafter employed in 
teaching them at their fpare hour6 ; a furgeon to attend them 
when fick : And much praife is due to fuch a guardian of 
youth, for bis attention both to their health and education.

% 

doubled, in the courfe of about 4 years, and may now amount 
to 1 040 fouls. In the mill there are, at prefent, 4096 fpindles 
driven by water ; and the company are ft ill greatly extending 
rhcir operations. There is another very large houfe built contigu- 
ous to the mill, which is to contain 15000 fpindles, to be dri» 
ven by the hand : but only a very fmall part of thefe machines 
are as yet finiflied. A confiderable village is now built, for the 
accommodation of the people employed at this work, where 
formerly there was not a fingle houfe. 

The employment at cotton mills, has, in general, been ac- 
counted unfavourable to health ; and yet, what is lingular, in 
the prefent cafe, is, that out of a great number, employed 
at work within the mill, only two have died fince it waserected. 
Great care indeed is taken, to keep both the houfe and machi- 
nery as clean as pofiible j frefh air is carefully thrown in ; and 
tar is burnt, to remove or counteract the noxious fmell of the 
oil, that mult neceflarily be ufed about the machines. 

Heritors — There are at prefent 37 heritors, who pay cefs  
and of thefe, 1 o do not refide in the parifh. The landed pro- 
perty has very feldom been transferred : for, though there are 
few poflefled of more than a plowgate of land, and fome who 
have only a few acres, yet many even of thefe fmall pofleflions, 
have been inherited by the fame family, for fome hundred 
years. This retention of landed property, is plainly to be 
imputed to the induftry, frugality, and amiable rural fimpli- 
city of the inhabitants. The whole pariln confifts of 24 
plowgates of land, each plowgate containing about 80 acres ; 
and, for the mod part, the proprietor occupies his own 
lands. 

Produce. — The parifh confifts, for the molt part, of arable 
grounds ; and oats are the crops moft frequently raifed. Peafe, 
Vol. II. E e a 



218 



Statijiical Account 



few beans, barley, and wheat are alfo raifed ; but the quanti- 
ty of thefe kinds of grain is but fmall, when compared with 
oats. Potatoes are alfo cultivated by almoft every family, 
whether of farmers or labourers, for their own fubfiftence j 
and the practice of feeding cattle with them is become pretty 
general. Of late, more attention begins to be paid to the po- 
tatoe crop ; becaufe a ready market is found, for a confidera- 

ble quantity, at the cotton mill. The old Scots plow is 

almoft univerfally ufed.— There are few fheep kept in the pa- 
rifh, not much exceeding ioo. Flax is feldom raifed, in any 
greater quantity, than what' the farmer thinks fuffieient for the 
ufeof his own family. Avery considerable quantity of rye-grafs, 
and clover hay, is cultivated in the pariih, and carried to Glaf- 
gow^ about 8 miles diftant ; where it always finds a ready 
market, and in general fells at about 5d per done. Confide- 
r able quantities of butter and cheefe, ufed alfo to be carried 
to the market at Glafgow ; but there is now a great demand 
for thefe articles at home. 

Rent of the Par'tfi. The valued rent of the parifli is 

L. j 684: il : 8 Scots: the real rent may be about L. 1400 i 
but as the land is, for the moft part, pofielicd by the proprie- 
tors, this canyut be exactly afcertained. 

Manufaclures, and Price of Labour. — There are no manu- 
factures eftablifhed in the parifh, except the cotton branch al- 
ready mentioned. The only tradefmen in the place, arc fuch 
as find employment from the country people ; except a few 
weavers, who are employed by manufacturers in Glafgow. — 
The iron mines in the neighbourhood, together with the ope- 
rations of the cotton manufacturers, have contributed greatly 
to raife the wages of labourers. Before the iron age, (as it may 
be here called,) overtook us, a man's wages by the day, 
was never above is; but now they are advanced to 1 5c! and

l6d. The average rate at which men-fervants are hired by 
the farmer for the year, and who are maintained in the fami- 
ly, is from 8 toL.9 : and women-fervants ufually get from 3 
to L. 4 per annum. The work in agriculture is, for the molt 
part, carried on by hired fervants. 

Ecclcftajlical State. The manfe was built in 1773: but 

there is no record of the time, when the church was built. It 
bears evident marks of great antiquity; and is in a moft de- 
plorable condition. Lord Blantyre is patron The fli- 

pend confifts of 56 bolls of meal and barley, and L. 53 : 6 : 8 
of money ; with the addition of a manfe, and glebe of about 
12 acres. 

Schools. ' • There is only one fchool in the parifh, befides 
the one already mentioned, at the Cotton mill. The fehool- 
mafter's falary is about L. 6; but he has neither houfe nor 
garden belonging to the office. The number of fcholars is u- 
fually about 50 ; and the whole living may amount to about 
L. 70 per annum. 

Akhoufes There are 8 alehoufes in the parifh. Before 

the cotton and iron works found their way to us, there were 
only two or three alehoufes ; but the increafe of numbers, has 
alfo increafed the demand for liquor. Upon the whole, how- 
ever, there is very little alteration, to be obferved, in the charac- 
ter and morals of the inhabitants. They are, in general, re- 
markably induftrious, fober, and contented : And from the 
fmallnefsof the parifh, as well as their peculiar circumftances 
of independence, they have acquired a ftrong fpirit of equali- 
ty, and a fort of efprit du corpj, that renders them ready to u- 

njte in fupporting their common privileges There is no in- 

E e 2 ftance 



220 Statiflical Account 

ftance can be remembered, of any perfon belonging to the pa- 
rifh, differing any capital punifnment. 

Poor. The number of the poor, on the parifh roll, is n- 

fually about four or five. The parifh have a ftock for the fup- 
port of the poor, amounting to about L. 200 ; the intereft of 
which, together with the weekly collections, affords a com- 
fortable fupply for the indigent. All the heritors are joint 
managers of this fund ; and alfo in appointing fupplies to the 
poor, along with the minifter and kirk-feflion. The ftated 
meetings for the affairs of the poor, are on the firft Tuefday 
of February, and the firft Tuefday of Auguft. At thefe 
meetings, a committee is appointed, confifting of heritors 
and elders, to collect each in their turn, at the church doors, 
for the following half year : a treafurer is appointed to diftri- 
bute to the weekly penfioners ; and in his hand, all the week- 
ly collections are lodged. Occafional fupplies are alfo given, 
to relieve thofe who fall into accidental diftrefs. 

Fuel. The fuel commonly ufed in the parifh, is coal ; 

which is generally brought from Cambuflang, at the diftance 
of between 3 or 4 miles. It is fold at the coal pit at yd 
per hutch, amounting to 400 wt. two of which make 
an ordinary cart-load ; fo that a ton, containing five hutches, 
or 2oco wt. cofts 3s od. There are plenty of good peats in 
the parifh, which are ufed for part of the fuel ; but the coals, 
being exceedingly good, are preferred. 

Antiquities.— -There are few remains of antiquity be- 
tides the ruins of the priory. A considerable part, of the 
walls of that antient building, is ftill Handing. It was buiif. 
cn the top of a high rock, which rifes perpendicular from

cipice ; ami to look down from them, is indeed, to look from 
the pinnacle of the temple. On the top of the oppofite bank, 
which is lofty and bold, (land the majeftic ruins of Bothwell- 
caftle : fo that few places are to be found, affording fuch aw- 
ful monuments of the devaftations of time ; together with fuch 
a romamic profpec"t, formed by the bendings of the river, and 
the boldnefs of its woody banks. 

Little account can now be found, of the origin and 
hiftory of this religious eitablifhrnent. It appears from fome 
antient records, that it was originally a fort of colony, from 

the monailery at Jedburgh It is alfo recorded, that, 

" Friar Walter, of Blantyre," {probably he fhould be Riled, 
Prior Walter,) " was one of the Scottifh commiflioners, ap- 
" pointed to negotiate the ranfom of King David Bruce, 

" taken prifoner in the battle of Durham, in 1346." 

The following facts, concerning the Priory, are alfo mention- 
ed in Hope's Minor Praclics, Appendix, No. 1. Chap. 2. 
Canon Regulars, page 420. " Blantire, in Clydefdale, a 
11 Priory of this order, was founded before the year 1296; 
" for, at that time, Frere William, Priour de Blantyre, is a 
" fubferiber to Regman's roll," Prynne, page 663. " Wal- 
11 ter Smart, commendator of this place, was Lord Privy 
u Seal, in the year 1595; and, fhortly after, treafurer,

" a peer, by the title of Lord Blantire, the icth July,

" tire." 

Urns have been dug up at different times, in feverul parts 
of the parifh ; and fome of them were found lately, in a 
large heap of flones. In the centre of the heap, fcjuare 
ftones were placed, fo as to form a kind of chelt, and the

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7619236">STONEHOUSE</name>, 

(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 

By the Rev. Mr. James Morehead.</head> 



<p>Situation and Extent. 

THE parifli of Stonehoufe is in the county of Lanark, in 
the prefbytery of Hamilton, and fynod of Glafgow and. 
Ayr;— 18 miles from Glafgow, — 7 and a half from Hamilton, 
— and nearly the fame from Lanark. It is 5 miles in length, 
.nd, at an average, nearly 2 miles in breadth. No exact fur- 
vcy has yet been taken of it ; but, by comparing what has been 
furveyed, and what has not, it may be reafonably fuppofed to 
contain nearly, 6000 acres. Of the above, it is computed, that 
r.bcut 12 acres confift of mofs, and about 24 of muir. All 
the reft; is arable, excepting the banks of the river. The foil, . 
at the top of the parifh, is light,; in the middle and lower end, 
it is alfo light, but mixed with fome clay. It is laid out moll- 
ly in fmall farms. Four or five, perhaps, may pay between 
&amp;J and L. 80 of yearly rent ; but, at an average, they do not 

exceed 20 or L. 30. In the centre of the parifh, there is a 

very thriving village, called Stonehoufe. In the courfe of the 
Jaft 20 years, 35 new houfes have been built ; and 2 or 3 
more are to be built next fummer. Some of thefe houfes con- 
tain 



224

tain 2, 3, 4, and even 5 families. The village is principally 
inhabited by weavers. A few have begun to carry on bufinefs 
for themfelves : but, generally fpeaking, they are employed 
by manufacturers elfewhere. Some begin working the loom 
at nine^or ten years of age. The females are remarkable for 
fpinning fine. The village above is fuppofed to draw L. 500 
annually for that article. Some years ago, there was one 
woman, who fpan to the extent of ten fpiudles in the 
pound. 

Produce The produce, which principally confifts of oats, 

barley, and peafe, is, in general, more than what is necefla- 
ry for the confumption of the inhabitants. The furplus is fcnt 
to Hamilton, Glafgow, and Paifley. About 12 years ago, 
an attempt was made to raife wheat ; but, after repeated 
trials, it was found not to anfwer, and is, therefore, moftly gi- 
ven up. Every farmer lays his account to raife 10 or 1 2 bolls 
of potatoes yearly •, and to fow about a peck, or a peck and a 
half of lint feed, for family ufes. They have no fields either 
of potatoes, flax, or turnip. In the middle and lower end of 
the parifli, every farmer lias fome parts of his ground in rye- 
grafs. What they peculiarly attend to, is the dairy. It is, 
in general, expected, that the half, and in fome parts the 
whole, of his rent fhould be paid by the produce of the byre. 
They deal greatly in rearing calves for the butchers, which 
they fell from 20s to 3 or L. 4 each. 

Difcafcs. — There is no difeafe peculiar to the parifh. What 
has hitherto proved moft fatal, is the fmall-pox, which returns 
every 4 or 5 years. In 1778, 18 children were carried off in 
the courfe of a few weeks. Some have begun to inoculate : 
In every inftance where tried, it was fuccefsful j but the pre-

have attained to 90, but none, (at lead for thefe 30 years,) to 
100 years of age. 

Rivas and Mineral Springs. The Avon, which rifes 

in the parilhes of Avondale and Gallon, paffes through 1 
part of this dillricl, and run6 into the Clyde, not far from 
Hamilton.— Near the village of Stonehoufe, it has a fall which 
would anfwer for a cotton mill. — —There is a mineral fpring 
at Kitfymuir, which has been found to be of fervice in 
fcorbutic diforders. It would, probably, be more rcforted to f 
if fome attention were paid to the well, and if there were 
better accommodations neaf it. 

Mines Some years ago, there was a good coal-work in 

the parifh, the property of Mr Lockhart of Callle-hill, which 
was afterwards, in a great meafure, abandoned. Of late, 
different trials have been made, and it is hoped, it will again be 
fet a going. The parifh, in the mean time, has not fuffered 
much, being abundantly fupplied with coal from 3, and now 
4, different coallieries in the parifh of Dalferf, the neareft, 
fcarcely a mile, and the fartheft, not four from the village. 
At prefent, they coft at the work, 1 oi-d. per cart, which is 
more than double what they were 30 years ago. A cart is fup- 
pofed to contain about 30 ftone, Trone weight. The pa- 
rifh abounds in lime •, which has been much ufed of late, for 
the purpofes of farming. It is generally ibid in fhells, at 
L. 2 : 10 the kiln, and to the tenants of the proprietors, at 
L. 2 : 5. A kiln contains 100 bolls of flacked lime. In 
the river, and on the top of the lime ftone, there is plenty 
of excellent iron ftone ; which, in all probability, will be- 
come foonjan obje£l of importance. — There are alfo fine quar-

ries of free ftone, eafy to be got at, which has been of great 
fervice in the late buildings. 

Population. — By a lift taken in 1696, which feems to have 
been made out by Mr Foyer, the then minifter, there appears 
to have been, at that time, 87a fouls in the parifh : of thefe 
272 refided in the village, and 600 in the country. The re- 
turn to Dr. Webfter in 1755, was 823 fouls. By a lift made 
out by the prefent minifter in November laft, there were 
found to be 1060; of whom 593 refided in the village, and 
467 in the country. The village confequently has increafed 
321, and the country decreafed 133, fince 1696. The in- 
creafe, on the whole, in the laft 40 years, is 237. Of the a- 
bove 1060, there are,

Birth. — It is impofftble to ascertain the number of births : 
though there is a regifter kept, yet it cannot be depended up- 
on. Some of the antient Diffenters feem never to have regii- 
tered their children at all. Many of the Eftablifhed Church 
forget it. Since the late duty was impofed, there are many 
who refufe it. Some on account of the expence, and fome 
fVom a miftaken notion of religion. Some who now refide in one 
parilh, regifter in another, becaufe it happened to be their 
former place of refidence ; and ftrangers fometimes regifter in 
this, becaufe their children, by fome accident, have been bap- 
tized in it. As it ftands, the average will be found to be 25 
precifely, reckoning from the beginning of the regifter, which 
was in 1696, till November 1790, there being 2275 baptifms 
recorded. No regifter appears for the years 1721, and 1722, 
excepting 2 at the beginning of 1 721, and 4 at the end of 1722, 
which are not included in the above. Multiplying 91, the 
number of years, by 25, the number 01 children, the pro- 
duct is 2275, precifely. 

Death. — It is difficult to afcertain the number of deaths 
Of thefe there is no regifter kept. The only thing, that can 
throw any light upon it, is the account of the morf cloths, 
F f z kept 



12S Statijlical Account 

kept by the treafurer for the poor. But this will not be found 
quite fatisfa£lory ; beclufe fome, who reHde in this pa- 
rifli, bury in another, and confequcntly ^et a mortcloth from 
them ; while ftrangers, fometimes, bury in this ; and, fuppo- 
feng thefe to be equal, which it is probable they are, the ren- 
ter will be uncertain, becaufe mortcloths are feltlom required 
for children under two years of age. As it (lands, the an- 
nual average for thefe laft twenty years, will be found to be 
17 and y. 

Marriages. There is no authentic regifter of marriages. 

A lift of proclamations, in order to marriage, is kept, both by 
the precentor and treafurer for the poor. Thefe two have 
been compared, and found to agree. According to them, 
there have been, of proclamations, from the beginning of the 
year 1 761, to the end of the year 1 790, in all, 289 : Of thefe 
7 mull be difcounted, becaufe the marriages did not take place. 
Of the remaining 2H2, in 133 inftances, both parties refided 
in the parifh; — in 75, the man vefided, but not the woman ; 
and in 71, the woman refided, but not the man. Thefe 
facts being afcertained, every peifori will be able to tlrike an 
annual average, according as his views are, in making the in- 
quiry. 

"Dijfenters. — It is not eafy to afcertaln the precife number 01 
diflenters from the Eilablifhed Church, principally, becaufe 
many fcarcely know to what particular fe£t they belong. Such 
heads of families, as have come to a determination on this 
point, are as under :

their families, and according to the average of families above 
mentioned, the number of diflenters will be fomewhat more 
than 140. 

Refit, The valuation of the parifli is L. 2721 Scots: 

the veal rent cannot be exactly known. The heritors at pre- 
terit amount to iS. Four of thefe only have L. 100 of valu- 
ation ; and none fuch refide in the parifli. More than 
one half is the property of Mr Lockhart of Caftle-hill ; who 
is alfo patron. 

Poor. — The flared poor on the lift, in the year 1790, were 
13. The expence of maintaining them amounted to L.37 : 12; 
L. 4 or L.5 more were distributed in, what is called, occafional 
charity. The funds, for defraying the above expence, are raifed 
in the following manner : 

By collections, (at an average) - - L. 14 © o 
Intereft of L- 1 20 of principal ftock - - 600 
Money arifing from mortcloths, (at a-n average) 400 
from proclamations of marriage 084 

L.24 8 3 

If the above is not fufheient, as has been the cafe for fome 
pears, then a ftent is laid upon the parifli, one half of which is 
viidby the heritors,*according to their valuation, and the other 
talf by the inhabitants, according to their circumftances — 
^Sfone of the parilhioners are allowed to beg, though we 
.re much troubled with beggars from other pariihes. 

Stipend. The ftipend of this parifh is 97 bolls, 7 pecks 

nd a half of meal, and L. 16 : 12: 6, in money. Some 

years 



23-^ Statijlical Account 

years ago, it was paid by 60 different hands ; at prefent by 
42. The glebe is about 4 acres of arableground, and about an 
acre of pafture. At an annual average, ftipend and glebe will 
amount to a little more than L. 84 fterling. The manfe 
was built in the year 1761 : it coft the heritors, befides 
the old manfe, valued at L. 20, to the extent of L. 153.— 
The church was rebuilt in the year 1772 ; the expence betwixt 
400 and L. 500.

Horfesy Cows, and Carts. The parifii, in former times, 

was divided into forty ploughgates. On the fuppofition, that 
every plough has 5 horfes, younp and old, 12 cows, awl 



ftf Stonehoujc. 



J carts, the amount will be 200 horfcs, 4S0 cows, and 120 
carts. The carts are always drawn by one horfe only.—Thert: 
are fome fheep, moftly in the upper part of the pariih. They 
are fuppofed not to exceed 5 fcore. 

Roads and Bridges. The roads arc not in good repair; 

and it is not eafy to fay, how they can be made better. They 
are much hurt by the carriage of coal and lime. Materials 
to mend them are ill to be got. There are no turnpikes with- 
in the parifli. Two bridges over the Avon were both 
fwept away by one flood, in the year 1771 : but they were 
rebuilt in a year or two after, — partly by private contributions, 
and partly from the county funds- 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations . — The produce of the year 1782 
fell fhort of what was neceflary, for the confumptiou of the 
parifli. The deficiency was made up, by fome of the more, 
wealthy inhabitants, who purchafed foreign grain, and fold it 
without profit. — By fobriety, frugality, and a more diligent 
attention to bufinefs, the difficulties of that unfortunate feafen, 

were got over more eafily than could have been expected. 

The parochial fchool-mafter has too merks of falary, which 
at prefent is paid by 47 different hands. His perquifites, at an 
average, amount to 20s annually. The number of his fcho- 
lars are about 50; — his wages is 3d. per quarter ; — one third 
is deducted for the vacation quarter. The amount of the 

whole about L. 18: his payments a.e ill made; and 

fomething ought to be done, to make his fituationmore comfor- 
table. He has a houfe, and fchool-houfe allowed him by the 
parifh. They were built in 1781 ; and coft the heritors up- 
wards of L. 40.— Befides the parochial fchool, there is one ge- 
nerally at the head, and another, fometimes, at the foot of the 
parifh. The expence is defrayed by the parents of die children.

Statiftical Account 



There are 4 alehoufes, who have taken out a licence, all in the 
village. No very bad effects, on the morals of the inhabitants, 
have yet been felt from them ; but many fufpecl:, that this will 
not long be the cafe.--The difference betwixt employing cotta- 
gers and hired fervants, in agriculture, cannot be ascertained 
here, few or none in the parifh, having employed the former. 
— There is no jail in the parifh ; or were any of the parifhion- 
ers in prifon, during the year 1790. Indeed there has been 
no judiciary trials of any of the people of this parifh, for thefe 

30 years, one excepted, who was punifbed by whipping — 

The people in general, are of a middle fize •,— healthy in their 
conllitution ;--decent in their condu£t,~and, though they may 
have fome real, and fome imaginary grievances, yet they are 
as much contented with their ftate, as mofl of their neigh- 
bours.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3997687">LIBBERTON</name>. 



(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 
By the Rev. Mr. John Fraser.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, Surface, £sV. 
'HE antient and modern name of the parifli is Libberton * 



In the old feflion records, it is written fometimes Lib- 
berton, and fometimes Libertown. The origin or etymolo- 
gy of the name cannot be afcertained, unlefs we derive it from 
the Latin. 

This parifh of Libberton lies in the upper ward of Clydef- 
dale, and belongs to the prefbytery of Biggar, and the fynod 
of Lothian, and Tweedale. — The length of the parifli, from 
north to fouth, is about feven, and the breadth, from eaft to 
weft, about 4 miles. Its form is nearly a triangle. The face 
of the country, in this parilh, exhibits fo different an appear-

ance, that the eaftern and weftern parts of it, are a ftriking 
contraft to each other. That which lies towards the weft, on 
the banks of the Clyde, is, perhaps, the molt fertile fpot in all 
the neighbourhood. Much of its fertility is, no doubt, ow- 
ing to the inundations of the Clyde, which overflows the low- 
er grounds, or, as they called in this country, the Haughs, of- 
ten a dozen of times in the year The foil is a deep rich 

clay ; and from time immemorial, has been cultivated for 
common crops, without receiving the fmalleft particle of dung. 
The eaftern tracl of the parifh, is an irregular part of varied 
grounds. Though it be raifed confiderably above the level 
of the Clyde, yet it is not fo high, as to deferve the name of 
mountainous ; being, throughout its whole extent, a waved 
tra£t of ground, covered with heath, and, in fome places, 
fufceptible of tillage. 

The air is dry and penetrating, and far from being unheal- 
thy. The moft prevalent diftempers, among the people are 
rheumatifuis, and nervous complaints. The cold and WTetch- 
ed hovels, in which they live, are certainly the caufe of the 
former; the low diet, which they ufe, may occafion the latter. 

Rivers.-— Methven, which divides this parifh from that of 
Carnwath, is divided into two branches, Commonly called, the 
north and fouth Methven. The north branch takes its rife 
near Croflwoodhill, the partition which divides the county of 
weft Lothian, from that of Clydefdale : the fouth, near Gar- 
velfoot, in the parifh of Linton. Theft; two branches form a 
junclion in this parifh, within a mile and a half of the Clyde, 
and are a great accelhon to the waters of that rapid river, lr 
is here, perhaps, neceflary to obferve, that there is a fmall 
branch of the fouth Methven, which runs off towards the eaft, 
near Garvelfoot, and dividing at Dolphington, the counties of 
Clydefdale and Tweeddale, falls into the Tweed. This parti- 
cular 



of Libberion. 235 

cular circumftancc is a tlemonftrative proof of the great height 
wf this country. Both thefe rivers produce trout. Thofc 
found in the Mcthven, are fatter, and much better, than thofe 
found in the Clyde; which is, no doubt, owing tp the rapidi- 
ty with which the latter runs- In many dcip pools of the 
Clyde, there are likewifc perch and pike. The fifh caught in 
thefe rivers are never brought to public market, but fold to pri- 
vate families in the neighbourhood. 

Hills. — The only hill, in this parifli, is Couthboanlaw, now 

by corruption, called Quothquanlaw — The late Dr 

M'Farlane, fo celebrated for his knowledge in antiquities, 
was of opinion, that this hill derives its name from thefe two 
Erie words, Couth boan y which, in that language, fignify a 
beautiful, or fmooth hill : And indeed, it is one of the moll 
beautiful little hills, that is to be feen in any country. It is a- 
bout 600 feet above the level of the Clyde, and is green to the 
very top. On this hill, the common people, to this day, point 
out, with much fond admiration, Wallace's chair, where he 
had his abode, and held conferences with his followers, before 
the battle of Biggar. The chair is a large rough ftone, fcoop- 
ed in the middle. 

Population. From the feflion records, it appears, that 

the births in this parilh, from April, 16S3, to April, 1753, 
amounted exactly to 2205 : the annual average of which is 
3 1 4-- The marriages, during the fame period, amounted to 
563 ; the annual average of which, is a little more than 8.— •

parifh amount to 370 ; the females to 380, which makes the 
whole number of the inhabitants 50. Of thefe, none refide 
in towns or villages, there being none in the parifh, except that 
of Libberton, which fcarcely deferves the name of a village, as 
it only confifts of a few fcattered huts. 

From 1 783, (the time when the tax, impofed by parliament, 
on births and burials, commenced,) the records of this feffion 
have been kept with great accuracy : and from them it is found, 
that the births, from October, 1783, to October, 1790, 
were 122 ; the annual average of which is nearly 174-. The 
deaths, for the fame period, were 98 ; the annual average of 
which, is 14. The marriages for the fame time, were 29 ; 
the annual average pf which, is a little more than 4. 

Of the 750 fouls in this parifh, there are 109 below 10 ; 130 
from 10 to 20, 2S0 from 20 to 50, 199 from 50 to 70, 
and 22 from 70 to 100. 

The number of prcfefTed farmers, in the parifh, amount to 
40. But feveral of thefe, have only the half, and fome only 
the quarter of a plough. With their children and fervants, 
they amount to 198. — There are 6 apprentices in the parifh; 
— i 00 labouring fervants, male and female ; — 1 ftudent at the 
Univerfity of Edinburgh ; — 1 furgeon ; — the Seceders, of all 
denominations, amount to 98. 

From the faGs, which have been already Mated, refpe£ling 
the annual average of births, from 1683, to 1753, it appears, 
with all the force of demonftration, that the population of 
this parifh has decreafed very near a half. It is evident, from 

the 

rifh of Libberton, was in the decline of life, and totally unable to 
take an a£tual furvey of it. When the Doctor therefore applied 
to him, he fent his examination roll, which only contained thofe a- 
bove 8 years of age. This the clerk of the parifh, who has lived 
in it all his days, perfectly remembers. 



of Libberton. 237 

the feflion records, that there is an annual, and gradual decreafe 
of the births and marriages, from 1753, down to the prefent 
time. The annual average of births, from 16S3, to 1753, is 
31!; fo that the number of fouls in this parifli, at that time, 
could not be lefs than 1400. For it muft here be obfcrved, 
that the rule laid down of multiplying the number of births by 
26, the number of deaths by 36, in order to afcertain the po- 
pulation of any country, is, in feveral inftanccs, very fallaci- 
ous. The annual average of births in this parifh, for thefe 7 
years, is 17I, which, multiplied by 26, would make the inha- 
bitants amount to little more than 450. The annual average 
of deaths, during the fame period, was 14, which, multipli- 
ed by 36, would make them amount to 604. Whereas, accord- 
ing to the lift, which the incumbent took of them, in the courfe 
of his firft vifitation of the par'ifh, they amounted to 790. 
And, according to that, which he took with great care, about 
3 months ago, they amounted to 758. 

The births from January, 1 765, to January, 1775, amoun- 
ted to 223 ; the annual average of which, is about 22. From 
1775, to 1785, they amounted to 200; the annual average 
of which, is exactly 20. From 1785, to 1790, they amoun- 
ted to 89 •, the annual average of which, is about 17' . From 
thefe fads, taken from the feffion records, it appears, that the 
population of this parifh is materially different, from what it- 
was, 5, 10, and 25 years ago. 

This depopulation may be attributed to the following cau- 
fes : \Jl y To the non-refidence 1 of gentlemen on their eftates. 
When landed proprietors refide on their eftates, there muft be 
a number of fervants, dependants, and workmen of different 
kinds. Houfes would then be built, and marriages take place. 
Now there are 9 heritors in this parifh, none of whom refide 
in it, except two fmall ones, of L. 30 a year. Whereas, in 
former times, 6 confiderable families had their conftanfc refi-

dence in it, whofe hcufes are now partly demolifhed, partly- 
kept by a fervant or two. A kind of epidemical rage feems to 
have feized them to flock to large cities. 2tMy, This depopu- 
lation may be attributed, to the demolition of the villages and 
cottages, and the letting out the lands in large farms. The 
village at Libberton has been a place of fome note. Whereas 
it now confifts only of a few fcattered huts. That of Quoth- 
quan, has likewife been of confiderable extent •, and now there 
are not much above 100 fouls in it. The old people remem- 
ber double the number of ploughs in the parifh, that are at 
prefent ; and the ruins of demolifhed cottages, are to be feen 
in every corner. When a cottage falls, it is never rebuilt, be- 
cause the farmer is not obliged to keep it up. Since 1 760, the 
plan, in this country, has been, to deftroy the villages and cotta- 
ges, and throw the lands into as few hands as poffible. The 
evils, which muft attend the continuance of this plan, it is 
not difficult to conjecture. It is not too much to fay, that 
uulefs fpeedily checked, it will depopulate the country, with 
an alarming rapidity. 

Some defend this plan, of demolifhing the cotl*ges and vil- 
lages, and letting out the lands in large farms, by afferting, 
ehat though country parifhes be thereby depopulated, yet 
there is no real decreafe of population, the people only chang- 
ing the country for the town. But it ought to beconfidered, 
that towns never fupply themfelves with inhabitants. The 
country is the nurfery of population, and large cities would 
foon decay, were they not conftantly recruited from the coun- 
try. It is a truth generally admitted, that, in large cities, few- 
er children come into the world, and immenfely fewer arrive 
at maturity, than in the country, in proportion to the number 
of families. 

There are, at prefent in the parifh, 125 married men, widow- 
ers 



of Ubberton. 239 

crs included, and 28 bachelors. Among the bachelors are in- 
cluded all above 22 years of age. 

The number of inhabited houfes, is exa&amp;ly 168; which 
makes the number of perfons, at an average, to each inhabi- 
ted houfe, to be nearly 4!. 

Produce, t!fe. — The parifh produces no vegetables, plants, 
nor trees, but what are common in Scotland. There is, in- 
deed, very little planting in it. Though the wafte grounds 
are well fitted for raifing firs, and all kinds of hard wood, 
yet there Is no parifh, in the upper ward of Clydefdale, where 

!efs has been done to improve it in this way. The number 

of horfes in the parifh, amount to 2 19 ; black cattle to 700 ; the 
fheep to 1 149. 

There are upwards of 6000 acres in the parifh. Of thcie 
there are about 3500 in tillage, viz. 100 employed in raifing 
.barley, — 30 in turnips and potatoes, — 35 in flax — 24 in'fown, 
or artificial grafies, — 1 188 in pafture, — 2123 in oats. All the 
reft of the land may be called wafte, being fit for nothing 

but planting. The parifh fupplies itfelf with all kinds of 

provifions; and exports a confiderable quantity of meal, butter, 
checfe, and fome horfes and black cattle. 

This parifh has many difadvantages. From its high fitua- 
tion, it is much expofed to froft, which generally fets in verv 
early, and is very late in going away. As it ftands in the 
centre between the eaft and weft feas, it is 'ileewife expofed to 
the rains of both oceans, by which, the farmers often fuffer in 
harveft. Another difadvant age arifes from the want of (bel- 
ter. There are few (tries, or clumps of planting, to (belter 
ihc cattle during the fevcrity of winter. The vaft tract: of 
wafte land in the parifh, which at prefent is not worth 6d 
an acre, might be turned to great account in that way, did 
the landed proprietors attend to the intereft of their families. 

The 



Statijlical Account 



The only phyfical advantage, which it lias, arifes from the in- 
undations of the Clyde. The overflowings of this river, depo- 
fxte a kind of flime over all the haughs, which generally 
makes them produce good crops of oats, without receiving a- 
ny dung. 

The general rent of the bed arable ground is L. I : 5. the 
rent of the inferior, 10 s. The rent of the farms is from 
L. 79 to L. 3c. The number of farms, as already obferved, 
is greatly diminifhed, and will be diminifhed more and more 
in the courfe of four years ; that being the time when a great 
many of the prefent leafes will expire. Though the people be 
convinced of the great advantages of inclofing, yet the parifh 
is in general uninclofed. The foil however is, in many pla- 
ces, efpecially about Libberton and Quothquan, excellently 
adapted for raifing hedges, and inclofures of all kinds ; and 
until the landed proprietors do fomething in this way, the 
country will never be improved. It is to no purpofe to fow 
turnip and artificial grafles, while the fields remain open to 
the inroads of all kinds of cattle during the winter. 

The land- rent of the parilh, at prefent, is exactly L. 18 19. 
But were the lands improved, as they ought, the rental might 
be raifed much higher. 

Church and Stipend.- -The time of building the church,is un- 
certain, it being very old. It was repaired in 1759. The manfe 
was built in 176 1 ; and received fome inconfiderable repairs in 

1784. In confequence of a late augmentation, the value of 

the ftipend, including the glebe, and what is allowed for pro- 
viding communion elements, amount to L. no. — Mr Lock- 
hart of Carnwath is patron. 

Poor. — The number of poor in the parilh, is 12. The fund 
for their fupport, arifes from the voluntary collections at the 

church 



of Libberton. 



241 



church doors on Sabbath, — from mortcloths, — and proclama- 
tion money, and the intereft of L. 50, at the rate of 

4! per cent. The collections at the church doors, with the 

intereft of the L. 50, &amp;c. &amp;c. amount to L. 17 per annum 

The burden of fupporting the poor, lies entirely upon the far- 
mers, and the other poor inhabitants in the parifti. Though 
there be nine heritors, yet they never inquire into the ftate of 
the poor, nor contribute one farthing for their relief. 

Prices of Provfons and Labour.-' — The price of all kinds 
of provifion is double what it was 60 years ago. A cow, 
weighing 20 ftone, might have been bought then, for L. 2:15 
fterling : a cow, of the fame weight, will now coft L. 5. A 
fatted calf, which, at that time, brought 10s 6d. will now 
bring L. 1 : 1. The price of mutton, lamb, &amp;c. &amp;c. is raifed 
in the fame proportion. 

The wages of labourers in hulbandry, and other work, are 
generally is 2d. a day, except in the time of harveft ; then 
the men, when hired by the day, get is 6d. the women is. 
The wages of mafons a day, are is iod. — that of taylors, 
is. 

The wages of a ploughman, have, within thefe 5 years, ri- 
fen from L. 5 : 10, to L. 7 ; and fome of them get L. 8 : — that 
of a barnman, from L. 4, to L. 5:5. The wages of 
female fervants, are alfo raifed from L. 2:10, to L. 3 : 5. 

Antiquities. From the monuments of antiquity in the 

village of Libberton, there is reafon to believe, thai it has been 
a place of confiderable importance in former times. On the 
fouth and eaft, it has been furrounded with a ftrong dyke, or 
earthen mound, the foundation of which is ft ill vifible ; and 
which feparates the arable, from the wafte lands.— In the vil- 
lage, there are likewife to be feen, the veftiges of three large

penned vaults, which were certainly ere&amp;ed, as afylums for 
cattle. For it is a well known fact, that while war and tumult 
occupied the attention of men, in this country, animal food 
was their principal fupport ; and the lands that were under 
grain, were all bounded by earthen mounds, and divided by 
run-ridge, among the inhabitants, proportionably to their re- 
fpeclive interefts, the out fields being allotted folely for the 
ufe of their cattle. The ftate of the times required this regu- 
lation; — for when the families of Doughs and Buccleugh 
were wardens of the fouth marches, they allowed their retain- 
ers, conftantly to commit depredations on the inhabitants of 
this part of the country, deftroy ing their grain, carrying off their 
cattle, &amp;c. fo that, upon a fignal given, the whole villagers, 
(having all one Intereft), turned out to combat their fpoilers : 
And, as an afylum for their cattle, ere&amp;ed thefe penned vaults; 
before the doors of which they always built a high wall, and, 
on the top of it, Rationed men, with a quantity of large 
ffones, which they threw down upon the enemy, when they 
attempted to get at the cattle, by breaking open the doors. 
Many of thefe vaults, and walls, were to be feen entire, fome 
years ago, in this neighbourhood. 

About a quarter of a mile co the fouthward of the village of 
Libberfon, there are likewife to be feen, the ruins of a ftrong 
fortification, or camp. It Hands on the edge of a high, and 
barren muir, about half a mile from the Clyde ; and com- 
mands an extenfive profpecl of that river, to the fouth and 
weft. Its form, which is round, is quite diflinc"t : It compre- 
hends more than an acre of ground, and is furrounded with a 
double wall of earth : between the walls, there is a deep ditch, 
or vallum. There is no appearance of any ftone work about 
it, except in the middle, which feems to have been coarfely 
paved with free-ftone. About 300 yards to the fouth, there 
is a free-ftone quarry, out of which, thefe ftones have been 

dug, 



of Libberton. 



243 



dug, as appears from their being of the fame grain. From 
the entry, which has been upon the eaft, there was a ftrong 
earthen wall, which was plowed down a few years ago ; and 
which run to the north, and feparating the arable, from the 
wafte lands, joined the village of Libberton. Upon the 
fouth, there is to be feen the foundation of another ftrong 
earthen wall ; which likewife divides the arable, from the 
wafte lands ; and, running through a fteep defcent, joins a 
fmall burn, that runs through a glen. There is no tradition, 
concerning this camp, that can be depended upon. Perhaps 
it was erected by the Picls, during the time that they were in 
a ftate of hoftility with the Scot6 : and this conjecture is fup- 
ported by the following hiftorical fa£ts : It is well known, that 
the river Clyde was the divifive line, between the two con- 
tending nations. Now, as this camp is ftationed on the very 
verge of the weftern boundary, of the kingdom of the Picts, 
there is every reafon to believe, that it was erected by them. 
It may be added, as a further proof of its being Pi&amp;ifh, that 
there is to be feen, on the oppofite fide of the Clyde, at Dru- 
malbang, about 4 miles diftant, the veftige of a Scots lodge- 
ment, or camp ; to which they often reforted in their frequent 
excurfions from Dunbritton, (Dumbarton,) their principal 
refidence. It is alfo well known, that, when in danger of an 
attack from the Pitts, they betook themfelves to the ftrength 
of the hill of Tinro, which ftands in full view, and within 2 
miles of this camp. From all which, there is reafon to be- 
lieve, that this camp was ere£led by the Pitts : But whether 
there has been any engagement at, or near it, hiftory does 
not mention. 

About 300 yards to the eaftward of this camp, are three 
fmall artificial hillocks, which have all the appearance of being 
tumuli.

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiotis. About a quarter of a mile to 

the fouthward of the village of Libberton, there are quarries 
of free-ftone. Thefe ftonesaie veryeafily gotat; andare general- 
ly ufed in building the fewhoufes that are ere&amp;ed in the parifh. 
In the eaft part of the parilh, there is a coal mine. It has 
not been wrought for thefe many years, which is a great lofs, 
not only to this, but to all the neighbouring parifhes towards 
the eaft, as we are obliged, for want of it to drive our coals 
from places at the diftance of 12 or 15 miles. 

The fuel made ufe of in the parifh, is peat and coal. There 
is little, or no peat mofs here. They are moftly brought 
from Carnwath ; where each of the farmers, on Mr Lock- 
hart's eftate, have, what is called a room, in a large peat mofs, 
that lies to the fouthward of that village. Coal is brought 
partly from Douglafs, and partly from Cleugh, in the parifh 
of Carnwath. Fifteen (tone of coals, (or what the people 
here call a load,) coft 5d. at Douglafs; and at Cleugh, the 
fame quantity is bought for 4d. 

The number of ploughs in the parifh may amount to 46. 
They are of the old Scottifh kind, and made in a very clum- 
fy manner. The carts may amount to about 180. 

The people in this parifh are very economical, and far from 
being expenfive or luxurious for their circumftances, except in 
the ufe of tobacco. Smoaking is almoft univerfally pra&amp;ifed 
among both men and women. 

The people of this parifh enjoy, upon the whole, a confi- 
derable fhare of the comforts and advantages of life ; and, from 
their outward appearance, they feem to be contented with 
their fituation. The firm perfuafion of a future ftate is their 
great fupport, in the midft of all their poverty. The firft 
way to meliorate their condition, is to give them better houfes : 
for at prefent, the cottages, and many, even of the farm houfes, 
are fitter for the habitation of beafts, than of human beings. 

Property 



of Libberton. 



245 



Property in land has not undergone many changes, as will 
be feen in the following facts : In the nth century, this pa- 
rifh belonged entirely to two portioners, viz. the anceftors of 
the prefent Lord Sommervelle, and of Mr Chancellor, of 
Shield-hill ; both of whom came from Normandy, with Wil- 
liam the Conqueror, in the year 1066. After the battle of 
Haftings, not being provided for in England, they were fent 
to Scotland, and with the concurrence of the Scottifh king, 
were provided for as follows : The former, viz. Mr Sommer- 
velle, in the baronies of Libberton, and Carnwarth. This fa- 
mily gradually arofe in power and influence, and foon became 
the chief, in the upper ward of Clydefdale. Mr Sommervelle, 
being dignified, with the title of Sir Thomas Sommervelle, 
was pitched upon, after the Battle of Durham, as one of the 
fureties for the ranfom of King David II. Soon after he was 
farther dignified, with the title of Lord Sommervelle, which 
greatly increafed the power and influence of the family. But 
Gilbert, the eight lord, being vain enough to entertain, for 
many weeks, James V. with his court, at his caftle of Cauth- 
alley, (now by corruption, called Caw-daily,) reduced him- 
felf fo much by thefe, and other extravagancies, that he was 
obliged to fell the whole eftate ro the Lords Marr and 
Buchan, and betook himfelf to the lands of Drum, in Lothi- 
jan, which, it appears, were" the patrimony of his eldeft fon's 
wife. The lords Marr and Buchan pofleffed it for near a 
century. It does not appear, however, that they made any 
improvements, on either the lands or villages.. But there is 
reafon to believe, that Lord Marr, pafled a confiderable part 
of his time in Libberton. For there is (till to be feen, within 
the diftance of 300 yards of the prefent church, the veftige of 
an old houfe, called Marr's walls, (probably thofe of a hunting 
houfe i) and many other parts of the lands, about the vil- 
lage,

lage, arc called, to this day, Marr's braes, Marr's dyke, &amp;c. 
&amp;c. 

The common people, even point out the place, where 
his horfes were warned and watered. It ftands at the diftance 

of about 300 yards from his houfe. Thefe two lords, a- 

bout the beginning of the 17th century, fold this great eftate 
to Lord Dalziel, afterwards Earl of Carnwath, who pof- 
fefied it, down to 1676, when it was pur chafed by 
Prefident Lockhart, at a very eafy rate;' as the ar- 
rears, non-entries, &amp;c. went all into the bargain, and 
which, when recovered, reduced the price very much. It 
is afferted, by fome, that, at the period, when this *purchafe 
was made, fo great was the extent of the eftate, that the ren- 
tal then was equal to the prefent rental, L. 6000, notwith- 
ftanding the odds of the value of money, in the courfe of 
114 years. The Lockhart family have fold, at diffe- 
rent times, various parts of the land, which is the reafon 
that there are now fo many heritors in the parifti. 

As was obferved above, the founder of the prefent fa- 
mily of Shield-hill, came down to Scotland in the nth cen- 
tury, with Mr Sommervelle, and had, for his (hare, the ba- 
rony of Shield-hill, or Cauth-boan, where he built a moft 
beautiful houfe, on the lands called Road-head, about 300 
yards to the fouthward of the church of Quothquan ; a moft. 
beautiful fituation, having a commanding view of the Clyde, 

for many miles.— This family continued to flourifh, till 

1567, when the then Mr Chancellor, from a principal of loy- 
alty, joined the Queen's party at Hamilton, and was engaged 
at the battle of Langfide ; the particulars, and confequences 
of which are fo well known. After the defeat of the un- 
fortunate Mary, Regent Murray fent out a party to demolifh 
the houfes of all her adherents ; and among others, they burnt 
down the beautiful houfe at Road- head j the veftige of which 

ftili

ftill remains. And here it may be remarked, her great error 
after the battle of Langfide, was in eroding the Clyde. For, 
had fhe remained on the weft fide of it, among her friends, 
lhe might, with the reft of her fcattered army, have kept 
Murray, and his party, at bay, until a treaty had been made 
between them ; and confequently have avoided her difmal 
captivity, and ignominious death in England. 

There are 2 bridges in this parifh, over the river Methven. 
One of them was built by the county ; and the other, out of 
the vacant ftipend of this parifh, when the prefent incumbent 

was fettled The ftate of the roads is far from being 'good : 

they were all made by the ftatute labour, which, for fome years, 
was exacted in kind. But the heritors, not thinking that the 
farmers wrought fo well as they ought, agreed to commute it 
at 1 2s the plough : and, it muft be confefled, that the work is 
done to much better purpofe, fince this alteration took place. 
— The parifh, however, is fo extenfive, and the number of 
ploughs fo few, that the roads will never be good, unlefs the 
heritors agree to be at more expence themfelves. The gene- 
ral opinion among the people, is, that the advantages of turn- 
pikes, are great. There are none, however, in the parifh, ex- 
cept the great road, which is juft now making, between Pee- 
bles and Glafgow, and which pafTes through the eaft corner 
of it. 

There are 3 fchools in this parifh ; — one in Libberton, one 
in Quothquan, and one in White- Caftle. The rates of teach- 
ing of the 3 fchool-mafters, are the fame, being is fterling, a 
quarter, for Englifh, — is 6d. for writing, — and 2s for Latin, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. The falary of the fchool-mafter in Libberton, is 
L. 8 : 1 1 fterling ; and the number of his fcholars is about 35. 
The falary of the fchool-mafter in Quothquan, arifes from a 
mortification, and amounts to L. 2: 10: the number of his 
fcholars is generally about 20. The fchoolmafter in White- 
1 Caftle 



248 



Staiiftical Account 



Caftle has no fixed falary ; being employed by the inhabitants, 
in that part of the parifh, to teach their children, merely on 
account of their great diftance from the fchools in Libberton 
and Quothquan. 

There is only one alehoufe in the parifh, which retails whif- 
ky, porter, and fmall beer. It does not appear, that it has any 
bad effect upon the morals of the parifhioners ; the people in 
this country being much lefs addicted to drinking than they 
were 40 years ago. 

Twenty-five cottages have been pulled down, or converted 
into ftables, and flails, within thefe 10 years, and 3 only have 
been built within the fame period. This is an additional proof 
of the depopulation of the parifh.

<p>HE origin of Kirkpatrick, or Kilpatrick, is evident. It: 



■*■ is a church, cell, or burying-place, dedicated to Pa- 
rick, the tutelary faint of Ireland; — a perfon, whofe name, in 
ntient times, feems to have been held in high veneration, in 
le fouthern parts of Scotland. The origin of Durham is not 
 evident. It has given rife to many fpeeulative opinions : 
ut mod probably it is derived from the Saxon words, 
}urr, which fignifies, dry or barren, — and Ham, which de- 
otes, a village, or the divifion of a manor. If this deriva- 
on be juft, Durham becomes defcriptive of a country that 
; dry and barren •, an appellation that is peculiarly appli- 
able to the fituation, foil, and furface of this particular 1 
iftria. 

Extent and Situation. — The parifli of Kirkpatrick-Durham 
; about 9 miles in length, from fouth to north, and between 

and 4 miles in breadth, from eaft to weft. It lies in the 
tewartry of Kirkcudbright, and in the prefbytery, and fynod

of Dumfries. It is bounded by the parifhes of Urr and Cro&amp; 
michael on the fouth, — by Parton and Balmaclellan, on the 
weft, — by Glencairn and Dunfcore, on the north, — and by 
Holywood andKirkpatrick-Irongray, on the eaft. The church 
is fituatednearlyin the centre betwixtDumfries, Kirkcudbright, 
and New-Galloway ; and is within 2 miles of the great road 
from Carlifle to Portpatrick. 

Antiquities. In different parts of the parifh, there are vi- 

fible remains of circular walls and mounds, of artificial con- 
ftruction. What thefe have been, or for what purpofes they 
were erected, cannot, at this remote period, be diftinclly as- 
certained; as there is no written record, to perpetuate the me- 
mory of their origin, nor any incontrovertible tradition, to ex- 
plain the ufes to which they were deftined. Some think, that 
they have been Roman fortifications, and others, that they have 
been Druidical temples : But the general opinion is, that they 
have been Danifh encampments. The impartiality of hiftory, 
however, prefumes not to venture dogmatical aflertions, on a 
fubje£r., where the knowledge of truth, is either fhaded 
by the drapery of fable, or loft in the fallacy of conjec- 
ture. 

Soil afid Si/rface.+-Thc- upper part of the parifh, which gra- 
dually rifes to the north, and which includes about one half of 
its extent, is, in a very large proportion, covered with heath. 

—Its average value, for pafture, is from is to 2 s per acre; — 

the grain, which is produced on fuch fpots as have been culti- 
vated, is little more than Sufficient to fupport the inhabitants. 
———The chief excellence, for which it is diftinguifhed, is the 
ftore of game, with which it abounds. Kirkpatrick moor has 
loiig been celebrated for that production ; and, on the return 

of 



of Kirkpatrick-Durham, 



of every fliooting fcafon, has ever invited the keen and active 
fportfmen of the neighbourhood, to enjoy their favourite a- 
mufement, on its rough and uncultivated furface.— The lower 
part of the parifh, which gradually declines towards the fouth, 
is almoft entirely arable. The foil is thin and fandy. When 
excited by lime, or other ftimulating manures, it produces 
rich and luxuriant crops ; and the grafs, which grows upon 
tliofe parts of the land which are improved, is kintlly and nou- 
rifhing. The average value of the beft cultivated land, in 
the lower end of the parifh, is from L. i to L. i : I o per a- 
cre. ' 

Agriculture and Produce. — The fyftem of agriculture, which 
takes place in Kirkpatrick-Durham, is much the fame asth?t 
which is adopted in other parifhes in the fouth of Scotland : 
As the principles of that fyltem have been fully explained, 
in the account of thofe parifhes, the ftatiftical hiftory of which 
has already been prefentedto the public, it would be improper to 

detain the intelligent reader by unneceffary repetitions.. 

The quantity of grain, annually produced in the parifh, can- 
not be precifely ascertained : — The reafon is this: The im- 
provement of land being only in its infancy, large fields, 
which formerly lay wild in a ftate of nature, are every year 
brought into a ftate of tillage ; fo that, upon a probable fup- 
pofition, a tenth, or twelfth part of arable land, within the 
parifh, which was formerly neglected, is put into a fituation 
of bearing grain; andconfequently, till the whole arable land, in 
the diftrict, is reduced to a ftate of culture, it will be impofliblc 
to fix, with any degree of accuracy, the extent of the annual 
produce ; becaufe the account of any one particular year, is 
extremely different from that of another. It is, however, 
proper to remark, that, even in the prefent partial ftate of cul- 
tivation, there is much more grain produced in the parifh, 
I i 2 than 



35 2 Statijlical Account 

than what Is neceflary for the maintenance of the inhabitant;' 
and the furplus is fent either to the Dumfries market, or to 
the Manufacturing towns on the weftern coaft of Scotland. — 
Experiments have been made to raife wheat, barley, arrd 
rye but the attempts have not been fc fuccefsful, as to induce 
a general imitation. The fpecies of grain, which chiefly em- 
ploys the attention, and which moil liberally rewards the toils 
of the farmer, is oats ; and it is highly probable, from the na- 
ture, both of the feafons, and of the foil, that oats will re- 
main the ftaple grain of Galloway. Great quantities of pota- 
toes are annually raifed : a confiderable proportion of them 
is ufed as food by the inhabitants •, and what is not neceflary, 
for the purpofes of internal confumption is eitherfent tomarker, 
or employed in feeding bogs, which, by many, is confidered 
as one of the mo ft lucrative branches of rural attention. 

Mills and Multures. The fpirit of agriculture, in Kirk- 

pr.trick-Durham, is confiderably checked, and the progrefs of 
improvement very much retarded, by a fevere fcrvitude, laid on 
a great part of the parifii, in confequence of an aftrittion to 
the mill of Locbpatrick : This, after a deduction of feed and 
horfe corn, amounts to about the twelfth part of the whole 
crop, produced on each farm, within the limits of the aftric- 
tion. This is a burdenfome, and moil opprcffive taxation : 
The farmers loudly complain of it; and, though their com- 
plaints are not heard, yet they feem to be reafonable. — For can 
any proportion be more evident than this,— that every tax, laid 
upon agriculture, is hoftile to the interefts of induftry, and to 
the progrefs of improvement, and, of confequence, mull be 
fubverfive of the public good ? It is hoped, therefore, that 
proprietors of land, andperfons of power and influence, will 
be roufed to exert themfelves, in order to procure relief both iipr 
themfelves, and their tenants, from this, and every other re- 
maining •

(naming fhackle of feudal oppreffion : And, it is not doubted, 
that the liberal fpirit of the Britifh Legiflature, will give coun- 
tenance to any regular application, that may be made to them, 
for a juft and equitable repeal of thofe laws, which are nor, 
only burdenfome and oppreilive to the fubjects of the country, 
but even, in fome degree, inconfiftent with the principles of 
a free conftitution, and contrary to the common rules of civi- 
lized fociety. 

Air and Climate The air Is extremely pure and health- 
ful. Having, at ail times, a free and fall circulation, its falu- 
brity is feldom injured by noxiou-. vapours. Comparatively 
lpeaking, there is but little lickncls or dileafe in the parifli. TRe 
inhabitants, who are naturally of a found conftitution, and 
who meet with no remarkable occurrences to waftc their 
flrength, generally enjoy the blcflings of life to a remote old 
age. There died lately in the parifh, a woman, aged 108 
years, whofe faculties were frefli, and almoft unimpaired to 
the la ft: ; and there are living in it, juft now, a number of 
perfons on the borders of 90, who fupport the fatigues of 
their refpecYive employments, with an altonifhiiig degree of 
flrength and ability, and who tell the tales of former years, 
with a vivacity and chearfulnefs, almoft approaching to the gai- 
ety of youth. 

R-i'crs and Lakrs. — The river Urr runs ilong the weftern 
fide of Kirkpatrick-Durham, from one end to the other. It 
riles from Loch-Urr, a lake of confidcrable magnitude on the 
confines of Bahnaclellan, and, after a winding courfe of a- 

bout 20 miles, difcharges itfelf into the Solway Firth. The 

Sfh, which are molt frequently found in. the Urr, arefalmon, 

it a trout, burn trout, and pike. There are 4 iarge lakes in 

the parifli, and 5 brooks, or burns, which, rif:ng from difl'c-

rent fourcer, and running in different directions, empty them- 
felves at laft into the Urr. 

Number and Occupations of the Inhabitants. — The popula- 
tion of Kirkpatrick-Durham, in former times, cannot be fix- 
ed by any certain rule, as, from time immemorial, there has 
been no parochial regifter of births, baptifms, or burials. 
The return to Dr Webfter, was 699 fouls. The prefeirt 
computation is about 1000: Of thefe, nearly one half are 
males, and the other half females.

The population of Kirkpatrick-Durham, for the laft 10 years, 
has increafed with furprifing rapidity and within the laft 2Q 
year6, may be fuppofed, without any great deviation from pro- 
bability, to have been doubled. 



Catifes of Pcptdatian. — The increafed population of the pa- 
rifh, is principally owing to the three following caufes : 1. A 
public and moft beneficial road, about 15 or 16 years ago, 
was made between the church of Kirkpatrick-Durham, and 
fhe Dub of Hafs, a harbour on the Urr, nearly where that 
river enters the Solway Firth; by which, a communication has. 

been

beert opened with the north of England, whence lime, that 
great fource of improvement, has been imported ; and thus, a 
fpirit of agriculture having been excited, it lias given employ- 
ment 'to a great number of labourers, and artificers of different 
defcriptions. 2. The proprietors of land, who were formerly ac- 
euftomed to let whole eftates to one tenant, for the purpofe of 
failure, (a practice which tended very much to depopulate the 
country, and toproduce continual emigration,) have of late years 
been induced to divide their property into fmaller poffeflions, and 
by that means, have greatly encreafed the number of tenants. 3 . 
A ullage has lately been erected in the vicinity of the church, 
which, though projected only about 7 or 8 years ago, has ad- 
vanced fo rapidly, that there are about 50 dwelling-houfes al- 
ready built, and nearly as many feued, which, it is expected, 
will be built in the courfe of 2 or 3 years. This village, though 
as yet but in its infancy, has given a livelinefs and animation 
to the place, formerly unknown in that part of the country; 
and has made a very confiderable addition to the number of the 
inhabitants. But, as villages will always become nurferies of 
diflipatum and prcfiigacy, when the inhabitants are idle, plans 
have been formed to give them honeft, and creditable employ- 
ment. In the courfe of the laft year, the three following fo- 
cieties, or copartneries, were ettablifhcd : 1. A foeiety for 
carrying on a cotton manufactory, confifting of 6 members, 
whofe operations were commenced on a capital of L. 1 20, or 
L. 20 each (hare. 2. A foeiety for carrying on an woollen ma- 
nufactory. This foeiety confills of 5 members, and begins its 
operations on a capital of L. 100, or L. 20 each fhare. 3. A 
foeiety of trade and commerce : This foeiety confifts of 80 mem- 
bers ; and begins its operations upon the fmall capital of 80 
guineas, or 1 guinea each (hare. 

Thefe focieties have their refpedtive regulations, drawn up, 
with 3S much care and attention as poffible, to prevent error or

fraud, and thefe are fubfcribed by all the members. The annual 
profitswhichanfefromthefedifrerenteftabli"iments,arepropof- 
ed, inagrcatmeafure,to be added to the original ftock,and thus, 
from fma 11 beginnings, to ad van ce by hu mble and progreflive fteps 
to fuch a degree of importance, as the fituajtion and circumflan- 
ces of the country will permit : And though the fmallnefs of 
the refpective capitals, may excite, in fome perfons, the idea 
of infignificance, yet as the plans are evidently calculated to 
promote induftry,— to give employment to the young,— and 
to advance, though perhaps in a fmall degree, the good of the 
country, they cannot fail to merit the approbation of every ho- 
neft and virtuous citizen. 

General State of the Panjb — The valuation of the parifh is 
L. 3500 Scots : the rental about L. 3000 fterling. — The king 
is patron — Dr Lamont is the prefent incumbent. The manfe 
and offices, which were built about 15 years ago, and the 
churcb, which was erected about 40 years ago, are all in a 
ftate of complete repair. The ecclefiaftical benefice, including 
ftipend, glebe, &amp;c. is worth L. 110 fterling, per annum. — 
The fchool-mafler's income, may be computed at L. 30 per an- 
mim\ as, beiides the legal falary, which is about L. 11, there 
is a free houfe, and the intercft of near L. 300 fterling of mor- 
tification. 

State of the Poor, and their Provifons There are few 

poor perfons in the parifn. Such as belong to that clafs, are 
fupported by weekly collections at the church, and the inte- 
reft of a fmall fund, faved out of the former collections. A 
few months ago, a fociety of a charitable complexion, was e- 
ftablifhed in the parifh, The appellation which it has affumed, 
is, The Sympathetic Society of Kirkpatrick- Durham ; and the 
place where it meets, is at the village before dtfciibed. The 
% 9 intention 



of fcirkpatrlck-Durham. 



*57 



intention of this fociety is to provide a fource of relief for the 
fick, and the old, for widows, and orphans. The fyftem on 
which the foeiety proceeds, is this; — every member, at his en- 
trance, pays downasfid.— and, aslong ashe continues a member, 
he gives in 6d. every montli, which added to the general 
ftock. Tliis money, under fixed and public regulations, is 
diftributed by the office-bearers of the fociety, to fuch as are 
found to be proper objects of relief ; and the office-bearers, 
who are annually elected, are refponfible for their manage- 
ment, during the continuance of their office. Societies of this 
dfifcription are becoming frequentin different parts of the coun- 
try, and they feem to deferve encouragement; — becaufe the 
delicacy of the human feelings will belefshurt, when fupplies 
are received from a fource of this kind, than when received 
from the ordinary fources of charity: and likewife they will 
tend, in a great meafure, to fuperfede, at leaft in this part of 
the ifland, the neceffity of other charitable inftitutions ; and to 
prevent the exiflence of thofe heavy taxes for the relief of the 
poor, which are fo much, and, on fome accounts, perhaps, fb 
}uilly complained of, in the fouthern part of the united king- 
dom. / 

Fair and Races. — There is an annual fair in the parifh, on 
the lalt Thurfday of March. It is held in the village before 
mentioned ; and in the afternoon, when the bufinefs of the. 
day is moltly concluded, foot races, and other diverfions, are 
exhibited, for the entertainment of thofe who chufe to attend 
them. This fair has increafed molt remarkably for the laft c 
years ; and if the manufactories, which are begun this year, 
ihould have any tolerable degree of fuccefs, it is probable that 
they will ft ill increafe more and more. About 4 years ago, 
a courfe was prepared, in a field adjoining to the village, foi 
horfe races, which have regularly taken place every year fince 

Vol. II- 1C k their 



1$ 8 Statijllcal Account 

their commencement, andare propofed tobe continued annually 
in all time coming. Thefe races have given a wonderful degree 
of publicity to the place, and have been the means of collecting 
great numbers of fpe&amp;ators : At the laft races, the perfons 
prefent were computed to be not fewer than 8000. They are 
attended by the nobility and gentry of the neighbouring diftricb 
of Dumfries and Galloway, and the fportsof the day are always 
concluded by a ball in the evening, which is held in an afTem- 
bly-room, lately built in the village ; that is finifhed in a 
ftyle of elegance and accommodation, which excites the afto- 
nifhment of ftrangers. 

Inns — There are 7 inns, or alehoufes in the parifh, which 
are faid to be very well frequented •, and which, it is believed, 
produce, in this parifh, much the fame effects as they do in 0- 
ther parifhes ; — that is, a mixture of good and evil : on one- 
hand, they are productive of good, by affording entertainment 
to the traveller, and accommodation to thofe who have occa- 
fion to meet, upon private or public bufinefs and, on the Ei- 
ther hand, they are productive of evil, by giving opportunity 
to the idle and diffipated, to indulge themfeives in practices, 
which are but little connected with either the temporal or fpi- 
ritual interefts of fociety. 

Roads. A road from Kirkcudbright to Edinburgh, and a- 

nother from New Galloway to Dumfries, crofs each other, at 
right angles, at the entry to the village of Kirkpatrick-Durham. 
Thefe roads have not hitherto been much attended to ; but 
the high expediency, of having them put into proper repair, has 
of late attracted the notice of the gentlemen of the county ; 
and committees of the commiffioners of fupply, and juftices of 
the peace, have been appointed, to fix the proper lines for thefe 
roads, and to get them made as foon as poffible, When pro- 
% perly

perly finifhed, they will be of fingular advantage, not only to 
the parilh of Kirkpatrkk-Durham, but alfo to the county at 
large; — as, in travelling from Kirkcudbright to Edinburgh, 
the road over the moor, willbe at lead 1 2 miles fliorter, than 
that which goes by Dumfries and Moffat and farther, as it 
will open up an eafy and beneficial communication, betwixt 
the lower part of the ftewartry of Kirkcudbright, and the up- 
per part of the {hire of Nithfdale, by which corn and meal 
may be conveniently taken, from the ftewartry, to Sanquhar, 
and the country around it ; — and coals from Sanquhar, and 
limeftone from Clofeburn, or liarjarg, may be brought into 
the ftewartry. This country is evidently only in the infancy 
of improvement ; but a little attention and expence, properly 
applied, might foon bring it into a fituation, equally advantage- 
ous to the interefts of fociety, and honourable to thofe, whofe 
public fpirit induces them, by encouraging the exertions, and 
rewarding the induftry of their countrymen, to promote the 
general benefit of the community. 

Import and Export. — The articles generally exported from 
the parifh, not including flieep, horfes, or black cattle, which, 
at the proper feafons, are fent to different markets, are oats, 
barley, oat-meal, potatoes, and wool. The articles imported 
into the parifh, are lime, coals, ftone-ware, and thofe goods 
of all kinds which are retailed by the fhop-keepers. 

Fuel. — The gentlemen, who refide in the pavifh, generally 
burn coals, which they get from Sanquhar, Dalmellington, 
or Whitehaven. The fmiths get the coals, neceffary for the 
purpofe of the forge, from Sanquhar, or Dalmellington. The 
other inhabitants ufe peats ; of which there is fuch great a- 
bundance in Kirkpatrick-Durham, that the neighbouring pa- 
rimes of Urr and Crofsmichael, receive confiderable fupplies

from it every year. When once the roads above mentioned 
are made, peats will become of lefs value, and coals will proba- 
bly be ufed, (at lead in part,) by almoft all the families in the 
parifh. 

Price of Prcvifons. — The prices of grain and meal are very 
mutable; but in general, the price of meal is from is 6d. to 
2s per ftone :— butter about gd per pound cheefe about 4c! 
beef and mutton about 3d : — fowls from 8d to is. each, ac- 
cording to their weight or fatnefs ; — and eggs 3d, or fome- 
times 46. per dozen. The prices, of all the articles of con- 
fumption, have rifen greatly within thelafh ioyears;and are ex- 
pected to rife ftill higher, in proportion as the country be- 
comes richer, more populous, and more cultivated. 

Price of Labour. The price of labour here is very high. 

The wages of an experienced man-fervant, for the year, are not 
lefs than 7 or L. 8. The wages of an experienced woman- 
fervant, for the year, from L.? : i© to L.4. The wages of a 
harvefl-labourer, are from L. 1 : 5 to L. 1 : 10. of a day-la- 
bourer, is 3d. in fummer, and is. in winter ; of a mafoo, 
from is 8d. to 2s. 

The Ecchfaf ical State cf the Par ijb. —The ecclefiaftical af- 
fairs of this parifh, as in every other parifh in Scotland, are 
under the direction of the kirk-feffion. This court, anxious to 
regulate its proceedings, by a ftri£l regard to law, juftice, ex- 
pediency, and decorum, never indulges a fpirit of inquifitori- 
al inveftigation, or perplexes itfelf with a train of idle or vex- 
atious procelfes. There is no diffentyig meeting-houfe of any 
denomination in the parifh. There are a few C?.meronians, 
and a few Secedcrs in it ; but liberty of confeience, and the 
unqueftionable right, which every man has to qhufe his own

religion, are principles fo well under Hood, that few difturban- 
ces arife from the turbulence of faction, or the ftrife of con- 
troverfy. Though a religious feet, called Buchanites, refided 
for fometime in the parifh, yet that circumftance did not pro- 
duce one inftance of apoftacy from the Eltablifhed Church. In 
fhort, the wildnefs of fuperltition, and the bigotry of fanati- 
cifm are giving place to liberal fentiment, and rational religi- 
on : — and every good Chriftian beholds with pleafure, the 
dictates of reafon, and the maxims of morality, happily con- 
necting themfelves with the doctrines of faith, and the duties 
of devotion.

N U M BER XX. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">NEWTON UPON AYR</name>, 

(COUNTY OF AYR.) 
By the Rev- Mr. Peeeles...</head> 



<p>Origin of the Name. 

IN the charters granted to this burgh, Newton, is called 
Nova villa de, or more commonly Super Air. It is now 
generally known, by the name of Newton upon Ayr. It ex'v- 
dently derives that appellation, from its vicinity to the adjacent 
royal borough. Though built at a later period, it appears, that 
Newton originally poffeffed, as it ftill does, diftincl: and inde- 
pendent privileges, and hence it is called, not the Newton of 
sfyr, but x Newton upon the banks of the river of that name. 

Situation and Extent — Newton lies in the county, prefby- 
tery, and fynod of Ayr. It was at firfl included in the parith 
of Preftick, but was erecled into a feparate parifh in 1779. Its 
extent is very inconfiderable, not above a mile and a half in 
length, and a mile in breadth. It is bounded by the parifhes 
of Preftick and St Quivox, and, in every other quarter by the 
river Ayr, and the fea. 

The Burgh,— Newton is a burgh of barony, or regality, 

holding 



of Newton upon A)'i\ 



263 



holding directly of the king. By whom it was erected, is un- 
certain, as the original charters are loft ; but tradition lays, 
that Robert I. who, in his old age, was feized with a fcro- 
phulous, or leprous diforder, granted Newton and Preilick 
the privileges they now enjoy, in confideration of the kindnefs 
lhown him upon the occafion of his iilnefs. The fame king, 
it is alfo faid, endowed ;in hofpital for old infirm people, cal- 
led King's Cafe, which ftill exifls, and is fituated near the boun- 
dary of this parifh. The oldeft paper in the cufto- 

dy of the community of Newton, is dated in 1574, and 
contains a fhort precept, directed to the two baillies- of 
the burgh, empowering them to exercife authority in tin- 
town ; but there is no fignature affixed to it. All the privile- 
ges, formerly given to the borough, were renewed by James 
VI. of Scotland, and I. of England, by a charter, dated the 
24th of September 1595 \ and another charter, to the fame ef- 
fect, was granted, about 5 years after. 

In thefe charters, no mention is made of the internal regula- 
tions of the burgh ; but from antient and conftant ufage, its 
conftitution has acquired certain peculiarities. The number of 
freemen or burgeffes, is limited to 48, which compofe the 
community. Each of thefe freemen poiTefles, what is called, a 
lot or freedom, containing about 4 acres of arable land ; befides 
the common, on which the burgeffes have an exclufive right 
to pafture their cattle. No houfes are annexed to thefe free- 
doms ; but every burgefs muft refide in the burgh, or poffefs a 
houfe as his property, which he may rent to any of the inha- 
bitants. The community meet every two years to ele£t their 
magiftrates ; and, at this election every freeman has a vote.. 
They choofe two baillies, one treafurer, and fix counfellors, 
who have the management of every thing belonging to the 
burgh ; but on urgent occafions, they call meetings of the 
community. Of late, little or nothing has been done without 

taking 



Stat'iftical Account 



taking thefer.fe of the freemen. This method, however, ozi 
account of their numbers, is Sometimes a hindrance to bufinefs. 
The accounts of the treafurer are open to the infpe&amp;ion of e~ 
very freeman, and he is accountable to the community at large. 
The right of fuCceffion to their freedoms is limited. A fou 
fucceeds to his father ; and a widow, not having a fon, en- 
voys the property of her hufband as long as flie lives- But as 
the female line is excluded, the lots or freedoms frequently 
revert to the town, who difpofe of them to the molt induftrious 
inhabitants of the place, on their advancing a certain fum of 
money, which is placed in the public fund. Each freedom is valu* 
ed at L. 25, though none have given fo much for it. The com* 
moil revenue of the burgh, exclufne of thefe freedoms, is 
fmall. It arifes from certain feu dutfes •, the rent of a mill, 
a ropework, fome carpenters yards, and other fmall proper- 
ties, which produce about L. 60 per annum ; but of late years, 
they have derived considerable profit ftom the coal works in 
their eftate. This fund, however, is precarious, and uncer- 
tain. 

The Tavn, — its Grounds, and Surface The town prin- 
cipally confilts of one large ftreet, about 68o, yards in length, 
and about bo feet in breadth. It is unfortunately incumber- 
ed near the bridge, with a mill, Sec. the removal of which, 
would be a great convenience and improvement. There are 
three other ftreets in the parifh, but theirextent is not great. In 
that part of it, called Gawten-ftreet, there formerly ltood a 
large dwelling-houfe, denominated Newtonca-flle, which 
was, for a long time, the property of the Wallaces of Craigic; 
but now fome part of the wall, which inclofed the garden, a- 
lone remains. Thirty houfes have been built in the town 
within thefe thirteen rears; but ten of thesn on old founda- 
tion*. 

. . The 



of Newton upon Ayr. 265 

The greateft part of the ground, belonging to the communi- 
ty, is a dead level, lying to the eaft, and north-eaft of the 
town. — The foil is a light blowing fand, fo that the land, a- 
long the coaft to the north-eaft, wears a gloomy appearance. 
It might be meliorated, by rearing plantations of Scots fir, and 
of the larix, but, above all, of the pineafter, which is called 
the maritime pine, from its thriving fo near the fea. No du- 
rable inclofures can be made but at a great cxpence. The 
more [inland part is rather of a better foil, with a ftratum of 
mofs on the furface. It was once a morafs, but was drained 
many years ago at fome cxpence. By this drain, the water is 
conveyed, that ferves the mill, belonging to the community. — 
A plan of all their grounds was drawn up fometime ago by 
the Town-Council", and another was lately executed by the 
company, who rent their coal. The arable ground confifts of 
above 200 acres, and the common about 150. The whole is 
valued in the cefs-books at L. 1 17 Scots, and the property is 
cftimated to be worth in all L. 4000 fterling. From the na- 
ture of the foil, which is moflly a bed of blowing fand, to a 
confiderable depth, the ground is far from being fertile ; it re- 
quires conftant manuring to render it moderately productive. 
The beft and moft profitable crop is rye-grafs and clover. 
Oats and bear are the grains commonly fown. The feed-time 
for oats, is from the middle of March to the middle of April : 
and that for barley, from the 20th of April, to the 25 th of May. 
It is thought, that the inhabitants fow their grain much too 
late. Rye is fometimes cultivated with advantage 5 but this 

crop impoverifhes the ground Sea-weed is found to an- 

fwer as manure ; but the quantity caft on the fhore is not 

great The foil, in tolerable feafons, produces excellent 

potatoes. The whole parifh is open and unfheltered. No 

a tree to be found, and no thorn hedges of any growth, ow- 
ing to the violence of the wefterly winds, which often blow

feverely on this coaft, during the winter feafon. The property 
of the borough, however, might be much improved, and i*s 

value greatly increafed The only public road, is the high 

way leading through Preftick, to Kilmarnock and Glafgow, 
which is always kept in tolerable repair. On this road there 
are two turnpikes within the parifh ; one of which rents at 
L. 100, and the other at L. 285 per annum. 

Population of the Pari/h. — Not above a century ago, New- 
ton contained few inhabitants; probably from 300 to 400. 
Within the laft 40 years, the number has greatly increafed. 
This increafe was chiefly owing to an extenfive herring fifhe- 
ry, at that time, carried on along this coaft, particularly near 
the mouth of the river, which continued upwards of 15 years. 

When the coalleries on the Newton and Blackhoufe 

grounds began, the number of the inhabitants ftill increafed. 
In the year 1778, when the prefent incumbent made his firft 
parochial vifitation, the number from 7 years of age, and up- 
wards, was 1200; and that of fouls, 1600. Since that time, 
no enumeration of fouls hath been taken. For fome years af- 
terwards, the number rather decreafed, owing to the failure 
of the coal-works. But fince thefe have been refumed r which 
was about 5 years ago, the number has been increafing. At 
the laft vifitation, in fummer, 1790, there were found 1350 
perfons, from 7 years and upwards: Of thefe, 610 were 
males, and 740 females ; the number of families amounting 
to 380 ; the number of fouls to about 1750. The follow- 
ing is a ftatement of the births and marriages, for the laft 10 
years :

From the above ftatement, trie number of births, at an a- 
verage, amounts to above 46, and of marriages, about 1 3 an- 
nually. No exa£r, account can be given of the number of 
deaths, as no proper burial ground has been allotted for the 
ufe of the inhabitants : the greatelt part burying in Preftick or 
Ayr, in St Quivox, and the burying ground belonging to the 
Seceding meeting-houfe, in the parifh of St Quivox. Burial- 
ground is much needed ; which the community might pro- 
vide at a fmallexpence, by inclofing a part of their walte land, 
in the vicinity of the town. The number of deaths is fuppof- 
ed to amount to 30, annually. The whole of the inhabi- 
tants belong to the Eftablifhed Church, a few families excep- 
ted, (about 12 in all,) who are moftly of the feci, called the 
Antiburgher Seceders.

parifh. The borough lying at the diftance of 3 miles from 
Monkton, formerly the parifh church, where the inhabitants 
had little or no accommodation, the community, from the 
funds of the town, generoufly built the prefent houfe for pub- 
lic worfhip, in the year 1777, which was at firft eftablifhed 
with confent of the prefbytery, on the footing of a chapel of 
eafe. Finding this plan attended with fome difadvantages, 
the community, in the year 1778, applied to the Lords Com- 
miffioners for plantation of kirks, and valuation of tiends, to 
have their town disjoined from the united parifhes of Monk- 
ton and Preftick, and erected into a feparate parifh. In con- 
fequence of this application, they obtained a decreet for that 
purpofe, in 1^779; having previoufly purchafed the right of pa- 
tronage to their church, from the patrons of the united pariti- 
es of Monkton and Preftick. By the above decreet, it is efta- 
blifhed, that the community (hall choofe, every year, 13 of 
their number to manage the fecular affairs of the church, who 
are ftyled delegates. When a vacancy takes place, thefe 1 3 
delegates have the fole power of electing a pallor, and of 
granting a prefentation, with this provifo, that 9 of the 13 
muft be unanimous in the choice. 

The ftipend, at firft, amounted only to L 65 ; but it has 
fince received an addition of L. 10 per anmim y in lieu of the 
coal below the glebe. In 1780, the town granted a glebe of 
4x acres ; part of which is now occupied by the manfe ana 
garden. The ground being poor, and of a light fand, it rent- 
ed, before the manfe was built, only at 5 guineas per annum, 
though in the vicinity of a populous place. All that is allow- 
ed forgrafs, is the liberty of keeping a cow, and her follow- 
er, on the common belonging to the town. The glebe is 
not well inclofed^ which lefTens its value. The melioration or

the General Afiembly, deferves every poffible encouragement. 
— A manfe was firft built in 1787. A houfe is alio appro- 
priated for the parifh fchool. The number of fcholars that 
attend it, is from 40 to 5Q. The wages are 2s per quarter for 
Englifh ; 2s 6d for writing ; and 3s for arithmetic. There 
are fome private fchools in the town ; and a few of the inha- 
bitants fend their children to the fchools of Ayr, being almolt 
equally near. 

Poor of the Pimp. — Owing to the want of manufactures of 
every kind, and to the conftant influx of beggars from Ireland, 
few places, in proportion to their extent, are more diftrefl'ed 
with poor than this parifh. Many of them, indeed, who 
refide only a fhort time in the place, c3n lay no legal claim to 
fupplies from the kirk-feffion, but they are ftill a burden to 
the inhabitants, by their begging from door to door. The 
number of monthly penfioners is daily increafing, while the 
only fund, to be diftributed among them, is fmall and preca- 
rious. There is no fund indeed, for the purpofe, but what 
arifes from collections at the church doors, on Sundays, and 
facramental occafions, amounting in whole to L.50 per annum. 
At prefent there are 1 8 penfioners on the poors roll, each of 
which receives from 2s to 4s 6d per month; befides others who 
are fupplied occafionally. No ftent or tax has been laid on 
the inhabitants for the fupport of the poor ; but if their de- 
mands continue to increafe, as they have done for feveral years 
pall, that meafure will foon become unavoidable. Attempts 
have often been made to eliablifh regulations, concerning the 
poor in this part of the country, but, from various caufes, they 
have proved unfuccefsful. 

Coal. A confiderable quantity of coal is found in the 

grounds belonging to the community, and has been wrought 

for 



1J0

for many years. It was rented from the town, at L. 250 per 
annum', but the woiic was abandoned about 10 years ago, and 
the leafe was confequently broken. It was returned in 1786, 
by a company of refpe&amp;able gentlemen at Edinburgh, and has 
ever fince been carried on with fuccefs. The tackfmen pay 
a duty of 6d. to the town for eveiy tun they raife. The firft 
3 or 4 years, the town's profits amounted to above L. 300 per 
annum, which makes the number of tuns above 1 200 yearly,but, 
for the two Iaft years, the produce has not been fo confiderable. 
—The greateft part of the coal is (hipped for Ireland. — The 
prefent company, at fome expence, have made a waggon way 
from the pits to the harbour, the road reaching to the key, 
which renders it exceedingly convenient for loading velfels. — 
The price of the coal is 5s 6d. per tun, each tun weighing 24 
cwt. The quantity of water in the pits is fo confiderable, 
that it was found necefTary to ere£l a large fleam engine. The 
pumps are of 14 inches bore; and the quantity of water 
difcharged is 36 gallons at each ftroke, the flroke being repeat- 
ed about ten times in the minute, or 360 gallons in the minute. 
This difcharge continues 20 hours in the 24. — There are two 
feams of coal, about 4 feet thick each, the upper feam is 30 
fathoms deep from the furface ; the greateft part of which 
near the town, is already wrought. The lower feam, which 
is 20 fathoms deeper than the upper, is flill untouched. No 
probable conjecture has been formed, what quantity of coals 
remains in the grounds of the community. There is another 
coal pit in the parifh, belonging to a private individual, 
wrought by the above tackfmen, for which, they paya duty of 
lod per tun; but it is of fmall extent, and will foon be exhauft- 
ed. The coal in the Blackhoufc grounds, in the neighbour- 
bourhood, being in the parifh of St Qiuvox, comes not with- 
in the limits of this defcription. 



Harbour. 



of Newton upon Ayr. 



271 



Harbour. — Newton upon Ayr is a fea-port town; the north 
caft fide of the river, lying in the parilh, which, with the o- 
ther fide in the parifh of Ayr, forms the harbour. — The town, 
like that of Ayr, is fituated at a fmall diftance above the place 

where the veflels ly. A fewhoufes, of late, have beenbuilt 

nearer the quay.— The entrance to the harbour has always been 
precarious, by reafon of a bank at the mouth of the river, formed 
chiefly by the fandthatiscarvieudownthe river by land floods; of 
late years, the accefs has been ftill more difficult. The bed of the 
river is narrow, and the depth of water, at fpring tides, not a- 
bove 1 2 feet ; fo that veflels, exceeding 1 40 tons, regifler burden, 
cannot be brought over the bar. — In December, 1789, con- 
fiderable damage was done to the fhipping of this place : no 
lefs a number than 12 veflels, in one night, were ftranded, 
fome to the fouth, and others to the north of the harbour ; 
— one of them was totally wrecked, and all the hands in it pe- 
rifhed : feveral men, on board the other veflels, at the fame 
time, loft their lives. This deplorable calamity pointed out 
the neceflky of erecting a ltght-houfe. The defign was ac- 
cordingly carried into execution, by the gentlemen who rent 
the coal belong the community. At their own expen.ee, they 
erected, laft year, two reflecting lights, both of which ftand 
on the north-eaft fide of the harbour, in this parifh. A 
fmall duty is paid by each veflel for maintaining them *. 

Though

into the harbour at any time of the night : " ift, One of the lights

Though thefe lights were only erected in October, 179O, 
they have already been found very beneficial. The greateft at- 
tention has been paid to them, fo that no accidents have hap- 
pened through neglect. 

The principal trade carried on at prefent, in the harbour, is 
the exportation of coal. For four years paft, above 300 vef- 
fels have been annually loaded with coal, which go to Dublin, 
Belfaft, Learne, and other places in Ireland. A few veflels 
are alfo employed in bringing fir in logs, and plank, from Me- 
mel, and other parts in the Eaft feas. — Since the annexation of 
the Ifle of Man to the Crown, and particularly fince the late 
acts of parliament concerning fmuggling, any fpecies of illi- 
cit trade is now little practifed in this, or in any other part of the 

neighbourhood. There are two packet boats to Greenock, 

one to Liverpool, and fometimes one goes to Campbleton. 
No regular flated communication has hitherto been formed be- 
tween this port and London. 

Ship building and Rope work. —Vox many years paft, fhipbuilding 
has been carried on at this harbour, — but it is only of late, that 
this branch has met with any particular encouragement. By 
the activity and diligence of fome individuals in the parifli, 
a number of veflels have been conftructed, and the bufinefs 
feems to proceed with fpirit and vigour. It is carried on chief- 
ly on this fide of the river, as affording many more convenien- 
ces than the other. Fifty hands are employed in this branch of 

bufinefs, whofe wages are from 2od to ?2d per day. Oak 

wood is brought from England and Wales, fir from Dantzick :

the extent of the trade, at this time, will be about L. 5000 
per annum. 

The only rope-work in the neighbourhood is on this fide of 
the river. Some years ago, little was done in this line; but it is 
now beginning to revive. Ten hands are employed in manu- 
facturing ropes. The extent of the bufinefs is from L. 1500, 

to L. 2000 per annum The hemp is imported from Peterf- 

burgh. 

Fifjeries. A falmori fifhing is carried on at the mouth 

of the river, and along the coaft, as far as the parifh extends, 
to the northward. This fifhing, it is faid, originally belonged 
to the burgh of Newton ; which is the more probable, as fifh- 
eries are particularly mentioned in their charter : but it was 
purchafed from them, or otherwife got pofTeffion of, by the 
Wallaces of Craigie, who retained it in their hands till within 
thefe few years, when the eftate was fold. It was then pur- 
chafed by a fociety of writers or attornies, in the town of 
Ayr, who paid L. n 00 fterling, for it ; and now it rents at 
L. 80 per annum.— ——Your boats are employed in this 
fifhing, and four men to each boat; their wages is is per 
day. 

White fifh, haddocks, cod, and ling, with a few macka- 
rel, flounders, and lobfters, are taken in this bay. This 
fifhing is carried on by fome of the natives of the town, but 
chiefly by a fet of fifhers, who, within thefe 20 years, came 
from the parifh of Pitfligo, and the adjacent places in the 
north country. Moft of them refide in this parifh, and they 
are an induftrious fet of people; but their profits are not con- 
fiderable. Nine boats, and 4 men to each boat, are employed 
in this fifhery. 

Seal fifhing is alfo followed by a few of the inhabitants. 
One of the fifhers in this branch obtained, for feveral years

paft, a conGderable premium from the Truftees of the 

filheries, for his diligence and fuccefs Several go to the 

herring buflts, in the Weft Highlands, and Iflands ; but 
the two laft years were remarkably unfavourable, fo that they 
were great lofers by the expedition. The number of hands 
employed at fea, from this parifh, exclufive of the falmon, 
the feal, and white fifhing, amounts to 50 ; fome of whom, 
at one feafon of the year, go abroad in trading vefitls, and, 
at another, are engaged in the herring fifhery. 

Difeafes We fhall conclude this account with a few 

remarks on the health of the inhabitants. Though the 

grounds of the parifh ly low, yet the air is pure and healthy ; 
owing to the vicinity of the fea, and the dry and fandy bot- 
tom of the foil. No epidemical diforders are peculiar to the 
inhabitants; and infectious difeafes feldom prevail to any 
great height. It is, however, affirmed by fome of the 
medical department, that the air is too pure for conftitu- 
tions inclining to a confumptive habit ; — few of the natives 

of the place, however, fall a facrince to that diftemper. 

The health of the inhabitants is much injured by the too 
frequent ufe of fpirituous liquors. And it would be advan- 
tageous both to their health and morals, if there were few- 
er alehoufes. Though the town is of fmall extent, it is 
computed, that there are 12 public houfes, befides feveral places 
where fpirituous liquors are fold. On the whole, however, 
though the inhabitants, in general, do not arrive at extreme 
old age, there are few places, where the ineftimable bleffing 
of health is enjoyed to a greater degree ; fo that this part of 
the country has, with fome juftice, been called the Montpe- 
iitr of Scotland.</p>

<p>Extent, Situation, Surface, C5V. 

THE diftrift, which now conftitutes the parifli of Kirkin- 
tilloch, made, in the time of the Romans, a part of 
the northern boundary of the province of Valentia. When, 
at an after period, the country was divided into parifhes, it 
acquired the name of Wefter Leinzie. Under that denomi- 
nation, it was given, by Robert I. of Scotland, to Sir Robert 
de Fleming, in confideration of the eminent fervices, he had 
performed, in the courfe of the long and bloody conteft, which 
that monarch carried on with the Englifh, for the poffef- 
fion of the Scottifh throne.

* Roman Wall. — The remains of the Roman wall, and of three 
large forts, and as many watch-towers built upon it, may ftill be 
diftindtly traced in this parifli. The wall proceeds through Kirk-

pairing through the whole length of the parifh, Its former 
name was probably derived from that circumftance, fince 
Leinzie, may, by no very fanciful etymology, be coniidered 
as a provincial corruption of the Latin term, Linea. Its pre- 
fent appellation, Kirkintilloch, or rather Caerpentilloch, is 
faid to fignify, in the language of the antient inhabitants of 
North Britain, " the end of a long tongue or promontary of 
rifmg ground," which is exactly defcriptive of the fituation 
pf the town, ftanding on the extremity of a ridge, advancing 

from 

flrft of thefe polls upon the eaft fide, ftands upon the top of the 
Barr-hill ; a fituation fo elevated, as to command a view of almoft 
the whole length of the wall, both eaft and weft. The fort is a 
fquare area of 150 yards. Some vaults belonging to it, have later 
ly been difcovered. Thefe are ft ill entire ; and are covered above 
with flat bricks, and floored with a mixture of lime and black 
and white gravel, refembling fand from the fea more, very 
unlike any that is now to be found in this neighbourhood The 
next of thefe forts, proceeding weftward, is fituated three miles 
dift?nt, at the village of Auchindowie : this appears an oblong 
rectangular figure, extending 150 yards oneway, and 70 another. 
It is now almoft defaced ; one part of the area being now a corn- 
field, while another is occupied by the houfes of the village; and 
the reft has been cut away in opening the canal between the Forth 

and the Clyde. Two miles onward, in the fame direction, is 

the fort of Peel; fituate on a piece of riling ground, at the weft- 
ern end of the town of Kirkintilloch ; oblong and rectangular, 
90 yards in length, 80 in breadth ; Angular, in being fituated on

from the fouth, into a plain on the banks of the Kelvin. From 
the town, the name came at length to be extended to the 
whole diftri£t. 

The parifli is fituated in the (hire of Dumbarton, or Len- 
nox, in the prefbyteiy of Glafgow, and fynod of Glafgow 
and Ayr. It is of a triangular figure, no where exceeding 5^ 
miles inlength. Its breadth varies confiderably. — The face of the 
ground,althoughdiverfifiedthroughoutbyafucceffion of waving 
fwells, is no where broken into abrupt precipices; and, ex- 
cepting in one place of inconfiderable extent, no where de- 
formed by rugged rocks. There are no lakes in the diftricl;. 

The Kelvin is the principal river, which, of itfelf, is a confi- 
derable body of water, and, which is joined in its courfe along 
this parifh, by many fmaller ftreams 5 in particular, by the 
Skinna, and the Luggie, The latter pafTes through the towa 
of Kirkintilloch. 

Soil, Fojfils, and Animals. — The hufbandman finds a confide- 
rable diverfity of foils, through the lands in this diftritL The 
ground along the fouthern part of the Kelvin, is of a deep, 
marfhy nature, and is often overflowed by the river. The 
foil of a fmall tract, towards the north-eaft angle, is of a 
light reddifh earth, upon a whinftone and gravelly bottom = 
Around the town of Kirkintilloch, the foil is a light black 
loam, 16 or 18 inches deep, on a reddifh tilly bottom. A 
ftrong natural clay prevails through the fouthern, and the 
eaftern parts of the parifli. Tracts of mofs, affording a black 
peat earth, are interfperfed here and theie, throughout the 

whole diftricl:. Lime, coal, and freeftone, are found 

in great abundance. — The ftreams by which the parifh is wa- 
tered, afford falmon, trout, perch, and pike. — We have the

in a day. 

Cultivation and Produce of the Lands. The lands in this 

parifh are almoft entirely arable ; — and we have happily abun- 
dance of the beft manures. Our farmers, accordingly, are chief- 
ly employed in agriculture. Oats, barley, hay horn fown graflec, 
flax, peafe, beans, and a fmall proportion of wheat, are our 
chief articles of crop. Turnips begin to be cultivated among 
us. Dung, lime, a compofl of earth with other materials, 
and an addition of fimple earth, of a different nature from the 
foil of the field upon which it is laid, are the manures princi- 
pally made ufe of. 

A chalder of lime, confiding of 16 bolls, each of which 
contains 3 firlots, wheat meafure, is, at prefent bought, 
at any of the lime-works, in the neighbouring parifh of Camp- 
fie, for 6s 8d. 

The average produce of oats and barley, through thefe lands, 
may, in moderately favourable feafons, be about 5 or 6 bolls 
an acre : And, in years of moderate plenty, their average price 
in the -market, is from 13s to 14s, a boll. The farms are in 
general fmall; confiding commonly of about 50 acres each. 
The farmer is often proprietor, in feu, of his own farm. The 
lands may be eftimated as either actually yielding, or, at 
leaft, capable of yielding from 15s to 20s an acre, of yearly 
rent. 

Town, and the Employments followed in it The town of 

Kirkintilloch is a very antient burgh of barony. It was erected 
about 1 1 70, by William, King of Scots, in favour of William 
Cumin, Baron of Leinzie, and Loi'd of Cumbernauld; and ftill 
holds of the barony of Cumbernauld, for the payment of 12 
merks Scots, of yearly feu-duty. The privileges with which 

it 



of Kirkintilloch. 



i| has been endowed, are very ample. Its burgefTes elect 
their own magiltrates, independently of the lord of the baro- 
ny. The magiltrates are two baillies ; and are annually cho- 
fen. They are impowered by the charters of tire burgh, to 
hold courts, levy fines, imprifon offenders, or even banifh 
them from their liberties ; and in fhort, to exercife every right 
with which the baron himfelf was veiled, before the erection 
of the burgh. Thefe rights, the community have continued, 
ever fmce that period, to enjoy, undifturbed. They were, in 
no degree, affected by the act, by which the Britilh parlia- 
ment, in 1748, aboliihed the heritable jurildiotions in Scot- 
land- A large tract of land was alio annexed to this burgh at 
its erection ; and is now feued out, from time to time, in 
moderate parcels, as purehafers offer Linens and cot- 
tons, of different forts, are manufactured here. The wea- 
ver* are the moft numerous clafs of mechanics in it. Many of 
the orh^r mechanical employments, which fupply the necefia- 
ries, and the ordinary conveniences of life, are likewife prac- 
tifed. — Mr Stirling, younger of Glorat, a gentleman of dif- 
tinguifhed public fpir.it, lately erected a fmall cotton-mill. 
I land-machines, for fpinning cotton, were, at the fame time, 
introduced. The undertaking is in a very thriving condition. 
And, as the pavilh affords fcveral other happy fituations, it is 
probable, that thefe may foon be occupied by more works of 
the fame kind. 

Highways, and the Canal.—' -One of the great roads between 
Glafgow and Edinburgh, paffes through the town of Kirkin- 
tilloch ; which is 7 miles diftxet from the former, and 49 from 
the latter. — None of our rivers are navigable; but the great ca- 
nal between the Forth and the Clyde, paries through the whole 
length of this parifh. After having been frequently propofed,. 
fince the Union, this canal was at length begun in 1768, and

finifiied in 1790. The trade upon it is already great, and is 
rapidly increafing. One of its firft effects has been, to equa- 
lize, in a great meafure, the price of grain, throughout all the" 
corn-countries in Scotland ; to the temporary lofs of the 
landholders, in the fouthern, and to the gain of thofe in the 
northern diftricts. 

State of the Landed Property. In the beginning of the 1 

14th century, the whole parifh, excepting the burgh lands of 
Kirkintilloch, and the fmall barony of Wefter-Gartfhore, 
(which has, for many generations, been poffefled by that an- 
tient and refpectable family, the Gartfhores of Gartfhore,) 
were the entire property of the noble family of Fleming. 
But, in the long feries of years, which has elapfed fince that 
period, that great eftate has been gradually difmembered, part- 
ly in forming eftablifhments for the younger branches or con- 
nexions of the family ; and partly by fupplying the enlarged 
expences, required by thofe new modes of life, which have 
been introduced in the progrefs of fociety. The laft remain- 
der of it was fold off, in 1 75 7 : And nothing now continues 
in the pofTeflion of the former proprietors, but the feu-duties, 
and fome other cafualities of feudal fuperiority. 

The Poor — The poor of this parifh are not numerous. The 
weekly collections at the church-doors, have hitherto been 
found more than fufficient for their fupport. Thefe happy 
circumftanees are to'iie afcribed chiefly, to the minute fubdivi- 
{ions of the landed property in the parifh, and to the general 
manners, and perfonal habits, which ufually attend agricultu- 
ral induftry. But, it is to be feared, that if a greater propor- 
tion of the inhabitants, {hall be induced to apply themfelves to 
manufactures, one difadvantage which muft neceffarily arife 
from this increafe of induftry, isfuch a change in the manners

flute of helplefs poverty. 

State of Population. — The whole inhabitants of this parifh, 
have been found, upon a very accurate furvey, to amount, 
at preleiit, to the number of 2639. 

Of thefe 1536 refide in the town.

A good many taylors ; and a few hairdrefTers. 

In J 75 1, the Rev. Br. Erfkine, at that time minifter of 
Kirkintilloch, now of Edinburgh, found the number of the 
families in the town, to be 195. 

The families in the country 226. ' 

The perfons in the town, from eight years of age, upwards, 
575- 

Thofe in the country, from 8 years of age, upwards, were 
796. 

The addition of the Seceders and Quakers, at that time in the 
parilh, to thefe numbers, make up 1490 e.-.aminable perfons in 
the parifh. The return ofcfouls to Dr Webfter, was 1 696. 
Hence, it appears, that the increafe of numbers, within thefe 
laft 40 years, amounts to 943.

mind, and impatience of contradiction, which the j)ofleTfio1i 
of landed property frequently infpires, perhaps may occafion 
too many law-fuits. The prefent minifter was told, before 
he came amongfc them, that they were often dilpofed to treat 
their clergymen with neglect and unFmdnefs ; but he has ex- 
perienced nothing in his miniftry, that could juftify fuch an 
nccufation. The exiftence of Seceders, and of feceding mee- 
ting houfcs, has perhaps no bad effect upon the manners and 
fentiments of the people, either here, or any where elfe

checks upon the members of the efiablifhed church ; and the 
difcourfes of their clergy are often adapted, with fingular feli- 
city, to the capacity and the prejudices of the leaft enlighten- 
ed claffes in the community. The fmall number of the 

poor, dependent upon alms, and the liberal provifion made 
for them, by voluntary contributions, are facts implying, i;: 
fo populous a parifh, no common praife : they befpeak induf- 
try, fobriety, frugality, and charity, to be the leading features 
in the moral character of fhefe people. As to their exter- 
nal appearance, they are of a middle ftature ; and, being free 
from hereditary difeaies, while they enjoy the advantages of 
nn open fituation, and a pure, although rather moill air, they 
are, in general, vigorous and healthy. Some, indeed,- par- 
ticularly the females, are not a little fubject to hyfterics ; a 
difcafe, the prevalence of which in this place, has, with fome 
fhew of probability; been attributed, partly to the dampnefs 
of our earthen floors, and partly, to the effects of fpinning, 
for which, the women in this neighbourhood are defervedly 
famous *. . : . . .

Probable Improvements It is eafy to fee, that the parifh 

of Kirkintilloch, fituated as it is, in the vicinity of a great, 
an opulent, an induftrious, and a commercial city, and in 
a tract of country, where a pafTion for manufactures is fo 
prevalent, interfected by, a canal which joins the two great- 
eft navigable rivers in the kingdom, and which promifes to 
ipread cultivation, opulence, and induftry, every where a- 
long its bunks ; divided, too, by the great road between the 
two principal cities in Scotland ; poileffing fuch varieties of 
excellent foil, and fo plentifully fupplied with fuel, manure, 
and materials for building: — With fuch advantages, it is 
eafy to fee, that the population, wealth, and induftry of 
this parifh, can hardly fail to increafe confiderably, even be- 
fore the clofe of the prefent century. The value of the lands 
may yet be greatly raifed, by the introduction of .more jmprove- 
ed modes of agriculture : and fcarcely any place can enjoy 
circumftances more favourable to manufacturing induftry. 
It is, indeed, probable, that either manufactures or agricul- 
ture, might long fincc, have attained a ftate of ftill greater 
improvement, if they had not mutually checked one another's 
progrefs. The facility, with which a piece of ground has been 
hitherto obtained, in feu from the burgh, has generally tempt- 
ed the trader and the manufacturer, to retire too early to en-

fire. Beiide?, in turning her lint- wheel, the perfon who fpinf, 
commonly employs but one fo*ot, and ufes chiefly the hand of the

ly divided, by which the health cf the body mull naturally be a f- 
fedtcd. Laltjy, the wafte of faliva in wetting the thread, mull:

joy the confequence, which landed property confers, and to 
the pleafures which imagination fondly, but too often fallaci- 
oufly, afcribes to a life fpent in rural employments : Whilft a- 
ga}n, the profits of fpinning, and the manufacturing fpirit of 
the country, have commonly induced the farmer to pay only 
a partial attention to the cares of husbandry. 

Corruption of Morals likely to attend the increafe of Inch/fry, 

One unhappy circumftance, that may attend the increafe 

of induftry, and the introduction of new manufactures among 
us, is too important to be overlooked : Children becoming 
fooner able to fubfift by the profits of their own labour, will, 
of confequence, fooner difregard the authority of their parents, 
acquire earlier habits of expence ; and, being expofed to the 
infection of vice and difiipation, before the powers of their 
minds are in any degree matured, or their characters formed, 
— will be much more worthlefs in manhood, and more help- 
lefs in old age. It would be a happy circumftance, therefore, 
if politicians could contrive fome means, to preferve the virtue 
and morals of the people, while they are endeavouring to in- 
creafe their numbers, to enliven their induftry, and to aug- 
ment their wealth *i 

* The advantages refulting from our late improvements is at- 
tended with one circumftance, of which, we have reafon to com- 
plain, which is this, that the ufe of lime upon our lands, the filth, 
which is conveyed into our rivers, from the coal-works in the neigh- 
bourhood, and the machinery which have been erected, have alrea- 
dy rendered a falmon fifhery, which was confiderable, very infig- 
nificant ; and, indeed, there is too much reafon ro apprehend, that 
the fifh in our rivers will be almoft totally exterminated by the joint 
effects of thefe different fources of deftruction.

NUMBER XXII. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q646784">MOFFAT</name>. 

(COUNTIES OF DUMFRIES AND LANARK.) 

By the Rev. Mr Alexander Brown.</head> 

<p>Situation, Boundaries, and Name. 
HE principal part of the parilh of MofFat lies in the 



ftewartry of Annandale, now united to the (hire of 
Dumfries. Two farms only belong to the {hire of Lanark, 
and remain under the civil jurifdi£tion of that county. 

The parifti is bounded on the fouth by Wamphry; on the 
eaft by Ettrick and Line ; on the north by Tweedfmuir and 
Crawford ; on the weft by Kirkpatrick-Juxta. Its greateft 
length, from eaft to weft, is about 15 miles-, its breadth, 
from fouth to north is 9 miles. Its form is irregular, parti- 
cularly on the weft, where it joins Kirkpatrick-Juxta. 

The name is faid to be Gaelic, and to Signify Long-holm. 
The village of Moffat ftands by the fide of a holm, which, 
with a few interruptions, extends full 20 miles along the banks 
of the Annan. There is a river in the parifti, which is like- 
wife called Moffat. But whether the village derives its 
name from the river, or the river from the village, is uncer- 
tain. 




Moffat 



286 Statijlical Account 



Moffat is diftant from Dumfries 21 miles ; from Annan 27 \ 
and thefe are the neareft lea-ports. 

Rivers. — There are three rivers, which run through the pa- 
rifh, to wit, Evan on the weft, Moffat on the eaft, and Annan 
in the middle. Thefe three rivers join near the fouthern 
boundary of the diftricT: ; and the united ftreams bear the name 
of Annan thence to the Solway ffrch. 

Soil. — Upon the banks of the Annan, and the Moffat, there 
is a good deal of meadow and arable land. The foil is a mix- 
ture of clay, loam, and fand warned, down in the courfe of 
ages, from the mountains and high grounds. Above thefe, 
rifing towards the hills, the other arable lands are of a light 
dry gravelly foil, in moft places tolerably deep ; and with 
lime, which the farmers begin to ufe, producing excellent 
crops of oats. There is very little wheat or barley fown. 
But there are large crops of excellent potatoes. Turnip and 
clover alfo are very fuccefbfully cultivated. Lime is brought 
near 30 miles. 

The extent of arable land is not known, having never been 
meafured. It is guefled at about 3000 acres : about 300 of thefe 
ai-e fuppofed to be in crop, befides meadows. The land, in 

general, is very mountainous. 

?,larkct. Theie is a weekly market in Moffat, which is 

fupplied from the lower parts of the country. It is thought, 
however, that the whole grain produced in the parifh, would 
not do more than fupply the inns in the village. 

Air. — The climate is thought remarkably healthy. Though 
the rains are frequent, and fometimes heavy, yet in general, 
ihc air is wonderfully pure and dry. Every opening of the 

clouds

clouds difcovers a fky of a beautiful azure ; and this, together 
with the drynefs of the foil, it is believed, contribute greatly 
to health. Fevers fcldom make their appearance in Moffat ; 
and are generally much milder than in the lower parts of An- 
nandale. Agues are not known. The people in general en- 
joy good health. Many live beyond 80, and fome beyond 90 
years. 

Lake. — Lochfkeen is the only lake in the parifh. It is 1 ico 
yards in length, of unequal breadth. Where broacleft, about 
400 yards. The depth is not known. There is a fmall ifland 
in it, where the eagles bring out their young in great fafety ; 

as the- .water is deep, arid no boat upon the lake; The only 

fifh in Lochfkeen are frefh water trout, generally large; fome 
of them 1 1 inches long, which are very line in- the -fcafon. The ri- 
vers in the parifh are plentifully flocked with trout of the 
fame kind ; and a fpecics much fmallcr, fca-trout, alfo, fomc- 
tinics come up the l ivers in fummer, and a few falmon. 

Cafcadc. — The water iifuing from Lochfkeen forms a confi- 
derabte rivulet ; and, after running near three quarters of a 
mile, falls from one precipice to another, from a great height, 
Vnfhing and foaming, and thundering, between two high, fteep, 
and rocky hills ; forming the cafcade known by the name of 
'the" Grey Mare's Tail. It is Teen to the greatelt advantage af- 
ter a heavy rain ; when it appears like one unbroken fhset of 
water, from top to bottom. 

Aniiqmties. The rivulet, a little before it falls into the 

Mbffiitj h is carried away a part of a circle, in form of a Dru- 
id temple •, a fmall portion of which, however, ftill remains,, 

The Roman road, from Efk to Stirling, pafled through part 
• ' flifc parifh, to the weft of the village of Mofl'at. The vef- 

tiges

Stati/lica! Account 



tiges of that road, and of fome military ftations near it, arc 
full vifible. Some large Roman encampments; alfo, can be 
diftin&amp;ly traced in the neighbourhood. A piece of gold was 
found, a few years ago, in a mofs not far from the road, part 
of fome military ornament, marked with the number of the 
legion to which it belonged. 

There are vcftiges of an encampment, fuppofed to be Bri- 
tifh, near Moffat water, three miles fouth-eaft of the village- 
There is a moat of confiderable height, of a conical form, 
with a deep ditch round it, near the road which leads from 
Moffat to the well ; — a beautiful object from that roadatpre- 
fent ; and which will foon become more fo, being inclofed and 
planted by Lord Elliock, upon whofe property it ftands. An- 
other fmallcr moat ftands at the diftance of a few hundred 
yards weft from it. 

A mile eaft of the Roman road, and not far from one of the 
Roman encampments, are two caves, cut out of a freeftone 
rock/ fit to contain a number of cattle. But, when formed, or 
by whom, is beyond all memory. They are in a deep fequef- 
tereu glen ; and were probably made for ftielter in trouble- 
fome times. They ferve at prefent for offices to the farm- 
houfe placed near them. 

There are ruins of many old towers in different parts of the 
parilh. None of them appear to have been large. They have 
been built with lime made of fea fhells. They have probably 
been defigned as places of fecurity, againft the invafions of the 
borderers, or retreats for the inhabitants, when returning from 
their own predatory excurfions. 

Mountains The higheft mountain in the parifh, and 

perhaps fouth of Forth, is Ilartfell. Its altitude was taken, 
with great care and accuracy, by Dr Walker, profeflbr of na- 
tural hiftory in the univerfity of Edinburgh. It is within a 
2 trifle 



of Moffat. 28c) 

viiflc of 3000 feet higher, than the village of Moffat, which 
may be 300 feet, or more, above the level of the fea. There 
is a large and beautiful plain, upon the top of Hartfell, of ex- 
tent enough for a horfe race. The profpecl on a clear day is im- 
menfe : W:ftmoreiand, Cumberland, and Northumberland, are 
feen on the fouth ; the ocean, both on the eaft and weft, and, 
to the north, the view is terminated by the Highland hills. 
There is a fpring well near the top of the mountain. The 
fpring, called Hartfell Spaw, iffues from the foot of it. 

Moft of the hills in the parifh are very high, though they 
all fall fhort of Hartfell. They are moftly green, with very- 
little heath : S^me of them much broken with rocks. One 
hill, called the Yoke, is fo narrow at the top, that a perfon 
can lit with a leg on each fide of it, as upon a fuddle, and fee 
to the bottom on both fides, where two beautiful rivulets 
flow. 

Mines and Minerals'- No mines have been difcovered in 

the parifh, though fome flight trials have been made. Coah 
are brought from Douglas ; a few from Sanquhar ; both dif- 
tant near 30 miles. Fuel is confequently dear at Moffat •, fel- 
dom, even in fummer, can coals be bought, under iod. the 
hundred weight ; and, in the winter feafon, they coft from 
is. to 16, or i8d. 

Peats or turf are brought 4 or 5 miles, and fold at 2 s. the 
fingle cart load in fummer, and, in winter, at 23 6d. They 
•are generally very good ; and yet, dear as coal is, it is thought 
the cheapeft fire of the two. 

It is faid, that there is a confiderable body of allum 
rock in the pariih ; but no trial has been made of it. Indeed its 
mountainous Gtuation, and itc diftance from fuel, and from 
the fea, would render it of little no value. 

There is a fpecies of clay, which the fmiths ufe for fixing

their bellows in their furnaces, and of which the country peo= 
pie make, what they call, Hudds, to fet in their chimnies be- 
hind their fires, which, they fay, does not calcine or fplit with- 
heat ; and which, after it has flood the fire for years, and be- 
come hard as a ftone, upon being expofedfor fome time to the 
common air, it turns foft, and may be wrought and fafhioned 
with the hand as before. 

There is a vein of free ftone, which runs through the parifh, 
from fouth to north. It is red, but uncommonly foft and 
brittle ; and is, for that reafon, of little or no ufe in build- 
ing. 

There is a flate quarry lately opened in the parifh. The 
flates -are ftrong, and, it is believed, durable. They are 
not very fmooth ; and are of a colour between blue and 
grey. 

Animals. The quadrupeds, of the wild kind, are foxes, 

hares, wild cats, fulmarts, otters, badgers. The foxes are 
in great numbers. The farmers often fuftain confiderable lofs 
by them ; and it is thought, that few of them kill fheep, in 
comparifon with thofe, who live upon poultry, game, and 
the fmailer animals. Great numbers of them are killed by 
the farmers* and by the county huntfmen, almoft every fea- 
fon. 

It is probable that, in former times, the mountains abound- 
ed with deer ; as feveral places in the parifh derive their 
names from that animal, as Hartfi.ll, Harthope, Raecluegh, 
&amp;c. 

Came. — There are both red and black game in the parifh ; 
not much, indeed, of the latter ; but they are increafing, and 
as the plantations get forward, it is expected, that they will 
become more numerous. There are abundance of partridges in 



of Moffat. 29 Z 

the lowlands, and plovers in the muirs. Birds from the fea- 
fhore come in the feafon to hatch — The common migratory 
birds, are the cuckow, the fwallow, and the woodcock. The 
bulfinch has appeared within the lad 7 years, and feems to 
multiply faft. 

Cattle. — Clack cattle are few in proportion to the extent of 
lands in the parifli ; chiefly milch cows, kept by the farmers, 
and the people in the village of Moffat. They are generally 
above the middle fize ; many of them excellent milkers. The 
number in the whole diftricl: is about 200. Hardly any bul- 
locks, or heifers are fattened in the parifh ; and only a few 
cows, not exceeding 30. 

In the neighbourhood of the village of Moffat, a cow is 
graffed at L. 1 : 10 fterling. New milk is fold for id. the 
Scots pint ; lkimmed milk for \. Butter for od. per pound ; 
ewe-milk cheefe for 6s. the ftone ; both heavy weight. 

Sheep. The fheep farmers, or ftore-m afters, are not 

much difpofed to publifli or make known the amount of their 
refpeclive flocks ; but it is fuppofed, that there are, in all, from 

18,000 to 20,000 fheep The prices of fheep flocks, of late 

vears, have been, for aged fheep, from L. 12 to L. 14 per fcore; 
for young fheep, from L.8 to L. 9 ; for lambs, from L. 3 : 15, 
to L. 6. 

Wool. Befldes the wool confumed in the parifli, about 

200 packs are annually exported. It has gone moftly to Eng- 
land, for thefe three years paft. Prices have been from 6 s. to 
6s 3d. per ftone. Within the laft 7 years, wool was fold un- 
der 4s • per ftone; fome under 3s. "Within thefe few years, 
there has been a confiderable rife of the value both of fheep 
and wool, 

O o 2 An 



Statljlical Account 



An intelligent farmer in the parifh, (David Irvine of Pol* 
moody,) has tried a very important and fuccefsful experiment 
for improving his wool. In the years 1787, 1788, and 1789, he 
put Efkdale and Tiviotdale rams, of the white faced, polled 
kind,ithefame with the Cheviot breed, to his ewes, of the horned , 
black- faced kind. In the year 1790, he fold the wool of the 
fheep, produced by that crofs, at 10 s. the 6 fleeces; the 
wool of his other ftock, which were of the horned, black-faced 
kind, and went exactly on the fame pafture, only at 6s 3d. the 
7 fleeces. He has found the fheep produced from the white- 
faced polled rams, as healthy as his other fheep ; and that an 
equal number may be fed on the fame pafture. The weight of 
the carcafe has not been materially altered. 

The ideas of the other farmers do not, as yet, coincide with 
this ; and many of them are eminently Ikilfull in the manage- 
ment of fheep. Yet Mr Irvine's farm, is as high ground, as al- 
moft any in Scotland. Should his plan of improvement be 
juftified by farther experiments, it would double the value 
of the wool produced in the parifh, by increafmg the weight 
a feventh part, and the price more than a third *. 

Few of the farmers wafh their fheep. They fmear heavily $ 
and apprehendj that the wool would lofe more in weight, by o- 
mitting that operation, than the additional price, (were it im- 
fmeared,) would compenfate. 

It is not long fmce the fheep, in this part of the country, were 
of the four horned kind ; a few of which, it is faid, remain 
itill in fome parts of Nithfdale. Their body is fmaller, but their 

wool 

* There can be no doubt, that the fine, clofe, fliort woolled 
breed of fheep, is the proper fort for a hilly country ; and that 
their wool may be brought even on the Moffat hills, to 3es. ny, 
perhap?, to 49s. a ftcne.

wool finer, thanthofe oftheprefentbreed. Their want of weight 
for the butcher, and greater difficulty and danger in lambing, 
have banifhed them from this place. The mutton of the prefent 
breed is excellent; not large, weighing only from 10 to 
12, or 15 pounds per quarter. The market is generally well 
fupplied with this and other articles of provifion. The price is 
ruled by that of Dumfries. 

Population. — There are 220 families in the village of Mof- 
fat, and 80 in the country part of the parifh. The number 
of perfons, young and old, rather above 1600. In 1755, they 
amounted to 161 2, according to the report made toUrWeb- 
fter. 

There are no houfes uninhabited. Some new ones were late- 
ly built in the village, and more are building at prefunt ; yet the 
inhabitants can hardly be accommodated. 

As jhere are, as yet, no manufactures in Moffat, many 
young perfons of both fexes go to other places for employment. 
An woollen manufacture is intended to be eftablifhed foon j 
and the neceffary buildings were propofed to be erected in 
fummer, 1791. As thofe who have engaged in this bufinefs, 
are poffeffed of [the important requifites of capital, judgement 
and activity, and bear moft refpectable characters, it is hoped, 
that they will fucceed, to their own intereft and honour, and 
to the advantage of the neighbourhood, and of the public at 
large. In that event, more of our young people will find bu- 
finefs at home, and fewer will emigrate. 

There are, at prefent, in the village and parifh of Moffat, 
50 weavers, 6 fhoemakers, 6 taylors, 4 fmiths, 8 merchants, 
1 watch-maker, 2 bakers, 1 butcher, 1 barber, 5 mafons, 6 
wrights, 1 phyfician, 1 furgeon.

Roads. — The road from Carlyle to Glafgow, pafTes through 
the parith, from foutli to north, for upwards of fix miles. — 
The mail-coach between thefe places, pafTes and repafles eve- 
ry day ; and, at an average, about 70 cart load of merchant 
goods, every week. The trade moftly confifts of cotton- yarn, 
and cotton cloth. 

The road from Dumfries to Edinburgh joins the Glafgow 
road at the village of Moffat, and parts with it four miles 
north of that village, on the hill, known by the name of E- 
rickftane-brae. A little further north, the rivers Tweed, Clyde, 
Evan, and Annan, take their rife : And though the Tweed 
falls into the German ocean at Berwick, the Clyde into the 
weftern fea below Glafgow, and the Evan and Annan united, 
fall into Solway firth, their fources are fo near each other, 
that one rivulet, which was formerly a branch of the Clyde, 
now falls into the Evan, 

The trade on the Edinburgh road is not fo confiderable as 
on the one which leads! to Glafgow. A mail-coach from 
Dumfries to Edinburgh was lately fet on foot, but has been 
given up. When that road is completely repaired, it will 
probably be re-eftablifhed. Both roads are made by act of 
parliament, and are maintained by the tolls. 

Woods and Plantations.— —There is one natural wood in the 
pnrifh, about 50 acres in extent; confifting of oak, afli, birch, 
alder, &amp;c. It is the property of William Campbell, Efq. 
writer to the fignet, who hath inclofed it properly, and pays 
every attention to its prefervation. It is upon the north fide 
of Moffat water, and adds greatly to the beauty of that part of 
the country. There was another natural wood oppofite to it, 
on the fouth fide of Moffat water, belonging to his Grace the 
Duke of Oiieenfberry ; but it was lately cut down, and, being 

left 



of Moffat. 29* 

Jeft u'ninclofed, is loft in future to the proprietor, and to the 
public. 

Near the foot of Moffat water, where it joins Annan, there 
are many large and thriving plantations, made by the late Sir 
George Clerk Maxwell; confifting of Scots, fpruce, Over, 
and balm of Gilead firs ; oak, afh, larix, elm, beech, and va- 
rieties of other barren timber, which do honour to the judge- 
ment and tafte of that public-fpirited gentleman ; and have 
rendered a place, formerly bare and bleak, one of the moft 
delightful fpots in Annandale. 

The Earl of Hopetoun has likewife made feveral confidera- 
ble plantations, to the North and Weft of the village of Moffat, 
which will foon be a great ornament to the place, and a laft- 
ing monument of his Lordfhip's zeal and patriotifm. 

Village. The village of Moffat, though in a high coun- 
try, is pleafantly fituated. It ftands upon a rifing ground, 
gently declining towards the fouth, to which the principal 
ftreet looks, and hath a fine profpe£t of the valley below. It 
is encompaffed on the weft, north, and eaft, with hills of dif- 
ferent heights, partly inclofed and cultivated, and partly in 
pafture. The ftreet is wide and fpacious, handfomely formed 
and gravelled, exceedingly fmooth, clean and dry in an hour 
after the heavieft rains; and is a moft agreeable walk to the 
inhabitants, and to the company that come for goats-whey, or 
the mineral waters. Annan runs on the wtft of the vil- 
lage, at the diftance of a few hundred yards, dividing a fine 
holm, which is beautifully diverfified, by the windings of the 
river, thejneadows and corn-fields. The planting, on all fides of 
the village, is feen from the ftreet, and every year appears with 
increafing beauty. There is one capital inn in the village, where; 
the poft-ofhee is kept. There are other kffer inns, and feve-

ral excellent lodging houfes, where the bed company may be 

accommodated. 

Mineral Springs. There are two mineral fprings in the 

parifh ; both well known, and juftly celebrated for their me- 
dicinal virtues. 

The firft has long ago been diftinguimed by the name of 
Mpffat Well, and is a ftrong fulphureous water, about a mile 
and a half from the village •, with an excellent carriage road to 
it, and a long room and (tables, and other conveniences, upon 
the fpot, for the ufe of the company, when they are drinking 
the waters. This well was difcovered more than 150 years ago; 
and has ever fince been much reforted to, from all parts of the 
kingdom. It is generally allowed to be a very effectual reme- 
dy in all fcrophulous and fcorbutic cafes, and is feldom known 
to fail, when the lungs are found. Mod wonderful cures have 
been effected by it. For many years paft, it has been gene- 
rally ufed, and with equal fuccefs, for creating appetite, and 
promoting digettion ; for bilious and other complaints of the 
ftomach and bowels ; for the gravel and the rheumatifm. It is 
a remarkably light water, and fo powerfully diuretic, that 
many of the common people are known to drink 8 or 10 bot- 
tles of it daily, throughout the feafon, without the fmalleft in- 
jury to their health. It fparkles in the glafs like champaign, 
and is fo remarkably volatile, that it cannot be drunk in per- 
fection, unlefs at the fountain. It is alfo ufed as a wafh. A 
chemical analyfis was made of it, in the yean65o, by Mr x 
M'Kaile, and lince that time by Mr Milligan and Dr Plummer. 

The other mineral fpring is known by the name of the 
Hartfell Spaw, and is four miles diftant from the village. It 
is a powerful chalybeate, and therefore taken only in fmall- 
quantities. It poficfTes a very fingular property, of being 
flrongeft after heavy rains ; but when taken up then, and pro-

perly corked and fealed, it will carry to any diftance, and 
preferve its taile and virtues many years. It is very fuccefs« 
fully ufed in complaints of the bread, ftomach, and bowels ; 
in all difeafes peculiar to the fair fex, and is a valuable refto- 
rative. It has alfo been found very effectual as a wafh, in 
healing obftinate ulcers, and cutaneous eruptions. A che- 
mical defcription of it is given by Dr Horfeburgh. It was dis- 
covered by John "Williamfon, more than 50 years ago. A 
monument, erected on his grave in Moffat church yard, by 
the late Sir George Maxwell, is meant to tranfmit his name, 

and the date of the difcovery, to future times. 

There is likewife a petrifying fpring, about 4 miles north 

weft from the village, but little attention has been paid to it. 

Goat Whew As an additional inducement to the invalid 

to repair to Moffat, a confiderable number of goats are kept 
in the neighbourhood of the well. The pafture is thought to 
be excellent, and the milk of the belt kind. It is fent to the 
village new every morning and every evening •, or, it may be: 
got at the farm-houfe, where it is milked, hard by the well, 
from the firft of June to the end of Auguft. 

Stipend, Churchy &amp;c The ftipend is loo guineas* The 

glebe meafures 12 acres, and has been let at L. 16 fterling. The 
manfe was built about 20 years ago ; and, though a fmall houfe, 
is a very fufficient and well executed building. The church 
was built about two years ago ; is a!large phin edifice, com- 
pletely fitted up in the infide, upon a regular plan, and may 
accommodate ieoo hearers conveniently. — The Earl of Hope- 
toun is patron. 



Poor The number of poor, receiving alms weekly from 

the parifh funds, is under ten at prefent. Befides, there are 
Vol. IL P p upward 



Statijlical Account 



upwards of 30 that receive occafionally. The ordinary col- 
lections at the church, amount to L. 30 per annum. Particu- 
lar collections are fometimes made for fpecial exigencies ; and, 
upon fuch occafions, the people are very liberal. 

General State. The valuation of the parifh, in the coun- 
ty books, is about 13,000 merks. The prefent rents of the 
landward part, including the parks and pafture about the vil- 
lage, amount to L. 3300 fterling. The rents of the houfes, in 
and about the village, cannot be exactly afcertained : Many 
houfes are poflefTed by the proprietors ; but eftimating the 
rents of them proportionally, with the houfes that are poffef- 
fed. by tenants, we may ftate the whole rents of the village, at 
L. 600. Total L. 3900. 

Half the parifh belongs to the Marquis of Annandale, and* 
to the Earl of Hopetoun- There are 1 1 or 12 other heritors, 
only one of whom refides in it. — There are many feuers in the 
village. 

The parifh has never been meafured. A few parks near the 
village, and fome individual farms, have been furveyed, but 
no map has been made of the whole diftrict, nor is it eafy to 
ejtimate what its contents may be.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1016925">GALASHIELS, 

(COUNTIES OF ROXBURGH AND SELKIRK</name>.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Douglas.</head> 



<p>Extent, Situation, tsfc. 
r T" , HE parifh of Galafhiels, in the prefbytery of Selkirk, and 
* fynod of Merfe and Teviotdale, lies partly in the fbirc 
of Roxburgh, and partly in that of Selkirk. The Tweed, 
which is here an inconfiderable river, divides it into two 
parts. The fouthern part belongs to the former, the 
northern to the latter county. It is of an irregular trian- 
gular form j but, at an average, may be about 5^ miles in 
breadth. 

Surface, C2V. — The country is hilly, and may even be cal- 
led mountainous ; Meagle, or, perhaps, Meg-hill, or May- 
gilt, being 1480 feet above the level of the fea. The hills are 
moftly green, though feme of them have a little heath. They 
are remarkably dry, and furnifh excellent fheep paflure. 
In fome places, fpots of rock appear, either a kind of rotten 
flate, or rotten granite ; the latter, a few feet below the fur- 
face, is hard, and ufeful for building ; and ftones t of confide- 
rable fize, of both kinds, are not unfrequently found upon the 
P p 2 furface, 



3oo 



Statiftical Account 



furface, remarkably hard and durable. One or two of the 
hills are conical ; but are fo completely covered with grafs, or 
turf, that nothing like lava can be feen. Nor are there any 
figured ftones, coal, minerals, marble, freeftone, or petri- 
factions in the parifh« 

Soil and Agriculture. — The foil is various; and the ftriking 
difference,between the foil on the fouth, and that on the north 
of the Tweed, deferves particular attention. In the former, 
it is, in general, deep, heavy, cold, and wet, on a bottom of 
clay or of rock. It is, in fome parts, perfectly red, and iron 
ftones are found amongft it. In other places, it is very po- 
rous ; but though light, is not fandy, or lying on gravel. 

There are feveral fmall lakes, and moffes, which yield excel- 
lent peats ; and, when drained, fome of them are full of fhell 
marie, of a good quality. — Oats, a fmall quantity of barley, 
and a few peafe, were the only crops raifed, till within thefc 
few years, that marie began to be ufed. Turnips, red and 
white clover, are now introduced, and the annual quantity of 
peafe and barley, is confiderably increafed. Of $00 acres, 
which, for the laft five years, have been annually ploughed, 
not above'four-fifths, have, at an average, been fown with oats ; 
whereas, formerly, that grain was fown upon, at leaft, nine- 
tenths of the ploughed ground. The other fifth is employed 
in turnips, clover, peafe, barley, and a few potatoes ; and, 
fometimes, in low grounds, there are fmall fpots of wheat.— - 
They fow as early as the feafon will permit, which is never 
before March ; yet they reap late, feldom before September, 
and fometimes have corn in the fields in November. 

Though only 500 acres, or thereabouts, are, at an average, 
in corn every year, yet, of the 2700, of which this part of 
the parifh confifts, at leaft 1500 acres have, in a kind of rota- 
tion, been torn up,partly for the fake of enriching the foil with 

maile,

marie, but chiefly, becaufe unfkilful farmers, after having o 
vercropped one part, by railing oats for many years fucceffive- 
ly, are forced to give it reft, and to break up what has long lain 
jn pafture. Notwithstanding the wetnefs of the foil, and cli- 
mate, the flieep walks are fufficiently dry, owing to the natu- 
ral declivity of the ground, and, in fome places, to drain- 
ing. 

On the north of Tweed, the foil, jn general, is dry and 
lhallow, lying partly on gravd, a good deal on till, and fome 
on rock. It is remarkably full of fmall ftanes, which almolt 
every where cover the furface. It has been found, however, 
by experience, dangerous to remove them, unlefs the lhallow 
foil, is, at the fame time, deepened and enriched. They are 
faid both to reflecT: heat, and to retain moifture ; and to them 
is to be attributed, m fome degree, the luxuriance and excelr 
lent quality of the crops, in this part of the diftricl ; which, 
confidering the fmall depth of the foil, are truly aftonifhing. 
Even here, there is a confiderable portion inclining towards 
clay ; fome of it is ftift* and deep, though, on the whole, not 
difficult to work. In fome hollows, there are fwamps, and a 
kind of mofs, yielding very bad peat ; and all the fpots, 
where mofs appears, if laid together, would fcarcely exceed 

10 acres. No marie can be found, by all the trials which 

have been made ; and, though it may appear incredible, and 
cannot eafily be accounted for, it is neverthelefs confidently 
alferted, by fome, who have made the fearch, that there is no 
marie in the whole range of country, from Tweed to the vici- 
nity of Edinburgh, except in fome places of the Merfe. 

On the clay foil, and high grounds, both oats and peafe are 
fown as early, and reaped as late, as on the^fouth of Tweed. 
But on the dry foil, which, though lhallow, produces the fu- 
reft and beft crops, oats are never fown, erupting in a very 
tempting feafon, till the very end of March, or beginning of 

April, 



3 02 Statijlical Account 

April. When the feed time of oats is over, potatoes arc 
planted, and the land, defigned for barley, receives a fecond 
furrow. — From the 28th of April, to the 12th, or even the 
15th of May, peafe are fown ; and from that time, barley, 
till the beginning of June. This late fowing, fupplies, in 
fome meafure, the defect of foil ; generally fecures a fufiicient 
growth of ftraw, and never endangers the lofs of a crop, from 
the latenefs of reaping. In every feafon, the lateil fown grain, 
on dry gravelly fand, ripens before the earlieft fown on clay 
land ; and grain of every kind, fown on dry foil, earlier than 
the above periods, feldom turns well out, except when the 

ground is very full of manure. Though harveft has been 

known to commence early in Auguft, and to be moftly over 
in September, yet it more commonly begins with September, 
and ends about the middle of October. 

This dry land may confifl: of 500 acres, of which 300 are 
annually in oats, and the remaining 2cq in barley, peafe, clo- 
ver, potatoes, and turnips, nearly in equal proportions. But 
as the three laft are produced in great perfection, it may be 
expected, that the increafe of thefe green crops, will diminifh 
the quantity of oats, fir ill annually fown, and help to check 
the ruinous fyftem of impoverifhing land, by a fucceffion of 
white crops. A few acres here, as well as in the fouthern 
diftridt, are fometimes dedicated to wheat. The reft of the 
land in tillage, on the north of Tweed, which is either in- 
clining towards clay, or lying in a high expofed fituation, con- 
fiding moftly of irregular fpotson the fides of hills, cannot be 
fo accurately afcertained, but may be fafely computed at 
100 acres ; on which hardly any other grain is fown, except 
oats, the fmall quantities of barley and peafe being fcarcely 
worthy of notice. 

Superficial Cor.iev.is and Produce. On the whole, the num- 
ber 



of Galajhiets. 36J 

ber of acres in the parifb, are calculated at 8000. Of thefe, 
upwards of 1200 are annually in tillage, of which above oco 
are in oats, and about 300 in barley, peafe, clover, potatoes, 
and turnips. The difference in the quality of grain, mould al- 
fo be remarked. In the worft fcafon, oats, on fome dry 
grounds, will yield at leaft at the rate of 8 ftone of meal per 
boll, Linlithgow meafure ; while, in the fame fcafon, they 
will not, on wet lands, yield, 5 ftone. Barley will alfo weigh, 
on dry grounds, 18? ftones,(the Linlithgow boll,) and on marled 
ground, fcarcely 1 2 ftones ; and, in general, all grains are 

heavier on a {harp foil There can be no doubt, but thar. 

more grain is raifed, than confumed in the parilh. But as a 
great deal of wheat, flour, and bread, is bought for confump- 
tion here, and, on the other hand, as large quantities of eve- 
ry fort of grain, wheat excepted, are exported to Edinburgh, 
Dalkeith, and Peebles, the furplus of grain produced, more 
than what is ufed, cannot be calculated with any degree of 
certainty. 

Ploughs and Cattle. There are 37 ploughs in the parilh:, 

moftly made after Small's model, fome with moulds of can; 
metal, and fome in the old Scottifti form ; which many, after 
trying the other, think moft fuitable to a ftony foil. They 
are, in general, drawn by two horfes, though four are fome- 
times feen in a plough, or two horfes and two oxen. There 
are 109 horfes in the parifh ; of which 92 are employed in 
draught, including ploughs, carts, and huckftering. The reft 
are young, occafionally, perhaps, yoked in the harrows, cr 
employed as faddle horfes. Single horfe carts are moftly ufed, 
and their number may be 64 ; all, except 5, carrying, folely, 
coal, manure, grain, and wood The black cattle, may- 
amount, at leaft, to 300, moftly young or milch cows, be- 

fide; 



3°4 



Statijlical Account 



fides thofe fed on turnips, the number of which cannot be 
afcertained. 

Sheep— Horfes and black cattle are here objects of inferior con- 
federation to fheep, for which all parts of the parifh are well a- 
dapted. According to the bed information, their number 
muft be nearly 5000 ; fome farmers thinking it greater, and 
fome lefs. This number, which cannot be far from the truth, 
is maintained on little more than 6000 acres •, from which 
circumftance, fome idea may be formed of the value of the 
pafture. They are, in general, of the long bodied kind ; ra- 
ther fmall, feeding only to 8| lb. rarely to 10 lb. per quarter, 
on the hill, but improving to i2t lb. and even to 15 lb. per 
quarter, in fheltered inclofures. The drynefs of the pafture, 
and fmall fize of the fheep, give them a juice remarkably rich, 
and a flavour remarkably delicate. Their wool is not fine, 
yielding only about 12 s. per ftone of 24 lb. Englifh, and 
taking 8 or 9 fleeces to a ftone. The value of it is leflened by 
the quantity of tar, with which, it is the univerfal practice, 
to falve the fheep, being fully equal to that of oil or butter ; 
but, in this neighbourhood, farmers now begin to ufe, 2 and e- 
ven~3 pints of oil, or melted butter, to one pint of tar, and think 
their wool is improved by this change. Judges afTert, that 
fmearing is, in general, unfkillfully performed in this corner, 
rhe feafon being too far advanced, and the ingredients being 
both improperly proportioned, and carelefsly laid on. With- 
out entering into points, which muft be determined folely by 
the experience of ftore farmers, it is natural to think, that 
this operation fhouid take place early in the feafon, before the 
days fhorten ; becaufe quantities of rain and fnow, are then 
apt to fall •, and when the fheep are once thoroughly drench- 
ed, they do not readily become dry enough to receive the 
falve to advantage. Befides, the firft attacks of cold and wet 

3 3T5 



of Gaia/biels. 305 

are always moft to be dreaded and guarded againft. Perhaps 
alfo, when done early, the wool will be more eafily laid afide, 
fo as to let the falve reach the fkin, which alone, and not the 
wool, it is intended to protect * — In juftification, however,- 
of the farriiers of thisparifh, let it be remembered, that about 
one fourth part of their profit strifes from raifing corn ; that 
their bar veil is late, and that, without neglecting their crops, 
they cannot well attend, earlier than they do, to fmearing 
their fheep. Let it alfo be obferved, that, as their chief ie- 
pendance is on their flocks, it is natural for them to be timo- 
rous in venturing on innovations, which may be attended with 
riik; and they can only be expected to adopt, by flow degrees, 
any alteration on the mode of treating their fheep, how- 
ever promifing it may be, until it is fully functioned by experi- 
ence. 

Commons, Woods, &amp;c. There is no land in common, or 

lying wafte j but upwards of 69 acres are occupied by houfes, 
gardens, orchards, ftack-yards, and dunghills. About 200 
acres are in wood, moftly planted, though part is natural. 
Lakes, modes, and the beds of Tweed, Gala, and Ettrick, 
by all of which the parifh is either interfected or bounded, will 
occupy, at leaft, 100 acres. — The produce of the orchards 
is trifling, confining only of a few common apples, pears, 
and plumbs. But the woods are valuable. Oaks, afhes, 
and elms, grow to a large fize, and are of in excellent quali- 

VoL.IL Qjl ty; 

* It feems farther probable, that good oil, being known to de- 
fend againft water, to meliorate wool, and deftroy vermin, it 
fubftituted for butter, and uied in a larger proportion to the 
tar, might both increafe the weight and the quality of the fleeces. 
The farmers, however, in general, prefer butter to eil.

ty: Scots firs, planes, and birches, are in great abundance, ancf 
equally thriving : And the larix, the beech, the mountain-alb, 
and feveral kinds of willow, though lefs frequent, are in great 

perfection.- The woods are frequented by the birds and 

quadrupeds, which are common through Scotland : Snipes, 
woodcocks, fwallows, fea-gulls, and wild geefe, are annual 
vifitants. Wild ducks remain through the year. — Little da- 
mage has ever been done by wind, thunder-ftorms, or inunda- 
tions. In fpring, 1782, both Tweed and Gala were fwelled 
higher, than they had been for 30 years before, yet did no mif- 
chief woTthy of being mentioned. 

Population. From traditional accounts, as well as from 

the veftiges and ruins of houfes, the population, both of the 
parifii and of the village, muft have been confiderable about % 
century ago ; and the general opinion is, that it has diminifh- 
ed. According to the return made to Dr Webfter, in 1755, 
the number of fouls then amounted to 998. Since 1770, 
when the prefent incumbent was admitted, the population has 
been on the increafe. By a lift, taken at that time, the inhabi- 
tants were between 870 and 880. A fecond lift, taken in 
January, 1789, made their number 901 ; of whom, 412 
were males, and 489 females; 352 were under 14 years of 
age, and 20 were above 70. By an accurate lift, taken in 
January 1 791, their number was as follows :

In 



of Galapneh. 307 

In the village of Galafhiels, 581 ;— in Lindean, 51 ; — in 
the country, 282. There are 209 families ; of whom, 18 are 
farmers, 28 are cottars, whofe residence depends on their re- 
maining in the fame fervice ; and all the reft are leafeholders 
for a longer or fhorrer time. 

The number of deaths, marriages, and births cannot be af- 
certained, becaufe many bury at Lindean, and fome in other 
parifhes; and many, from neighbouring parifhes, bury at Ga- 
kfliiels. Many of different feclaries alfo are not married by 
cltablifhed clergymen; and a ft 111 greater number neglect to 
regifter the births of their children. Yet the rapid increafe of 
population, and thriving ftate of the parifli, are plainly evin- 
ced by this circumftance, that, on the eftate of Mr Scot of 
Gala alone, there have been built, within thefe 20 years, fx 
farm houfes, with complete ofhce-houfes, and 32 good dwell- 
ing houfes, in the village; befides 39 dwelling houfes, (on a 
pari of the parifli of Melrofe, which lies immediately conti- 
guous to it,) containing 201 inhabitants, not included in tic 
above ftatement ; all of whom, except 4 families, removed 
from Galafhiels, for the fake of getting feus, in a fpot more 
convenient for carrying on their bufinefs. This fuburb, to 
which hitherto no reference has been made, muft necefiarily 
be included in the following information, relative to the dif- 
eafes, employment, character, and religious opinions of the 
inhabitants. 

Air, Difenfesy isfc. From the nature of the foil, the air 

muft be dry and healthy. There never was, in the memory 
of man, ?ny deftrucYive epidemical diftemper in the parifli. 
Even the fmall-pox, meafles, and chincough are not fata!, nor 
very infectious. Though each of thefe has repeatedly vifited 
the village, during the laft 20 years, yet none of them, at a- 
r.y time, became general or violent among the children. One 
Qji 2 half 



go8 Statiftical Account 

half of them, at leafi, efcaped the infection, and very few of 
the other half died. Inoculation is gradually gaining ground. 
Perhaps the mildnefs of the natural fmallpox, makes its pro- 
grefs flower, than it otherwife might be. Agues, and flow 
fevers are the mod prevalent difeafes ; rheumatifms and piles 
are not unfrequent. Fluxes and dyfenteries fometimes make 
their appearance. But the far greater number of deaths is oc- 
cafioned unqueltionably by ftvere labour, and want of proper 
attention to cleanlinefs, diet, and health. 

Mamtfaclure of Woollen Cloth.— The manufa&amp;ure of coarfe 
woollen cloth is here carried on to great extent. It has rapid- 
ly increafed within thefe few years, and is now brought to 
great perfection. From Midfummer 1774, to Midfummer 
1775, only 722 ftones of wool were manufactured into cloth 
by the clothiers, and fcarcely as much more could be made by 
private perfons ; whereas, in the current feafon (1790) 245 
packs of wool, (each pack containing 1 2 ft. of 24 lib. Engliih) 
have been purchafed by the manufacturers ; befides which, 
they receive from different quarters, wool, yarn, and weaved 
cloth, to a confiderable amount, to be dyed and drefled for 
private ufe, or for fale The higheft price given, per ftone, 
for wool, this feafon, is los, and the lowed: 7s ed ; but in 
general, the quantity purchafed is of that finenefs, as to raii'e 
the average price to 15s per ftone. The wool, being bought 
in fleeces, as it comes from the fheep, muft be aflbrted, fcou- 
red, and freed from refufe, in which procefs, it lofes at leaft 
one-fourth of its weight. A ftone of the fineft of it, weighed 
after being thus prepared, will yield 32 flips of yarn, each 
containing 1 2 cuts, and each cut being 120 rounds of the le- 
gal reel. Of this yarn, 1300 threads is the grcateft number 
put into the breadth or warp of any web, which, when finifii- 
cd, exceeds fevtn-tights of a yard in breadth, and fetches, in 

ready 



of Gala/hieis. 309 

ready money, at leaft 5s per yard wholefale from a dealer, 
or about 6s, when fold in retail. The coarfeft cloths are made 
of wool, which yields only, when fcoured, 8 flips per (lone. 
They are wove with no more than 600 threads of warp in the 
loom, are about fix-eights of a yard in breadth, when finilhed, 

and are fold, in wholefale to dealer?, at is4d per yard. 

From thefe fads, it feems fair to conclude, that the average 
produce of wool muft be 20 flips of yarn per ftone, and that 
the average price of cloth fhould be 3s 2d per yard wholefale. 
Yet, in fa£t, notwithftanding the high average price of wool, 
and its confequent finenefs, the average quantity of yarn pro- 
duced does not exceed 16 flips per ftone, and the average 
price of cloth wholefale, is fcarcely 2s6d per yard ; — a ftrik- 
ing proof of its excellence. For all manufacturers know, that 
wool, fpun beyond its finenefs, makes unthrifty cloth; where- 
as a thread, coarfer than the wool will admit, is both more 
eafily drawn; and more equal ; and confequently makes the 
fineft and moft durable cloth. In fpinning wool, 241 women 
are conftantly employed, befides accafional fpinfters- Such 
of them, as have no avocations, will make 12 cuts in a day, 
for which they are paid 6d. But as family concerns, field and 
harveft work, and fuch other bye-jobs, take up a great part of" 
their time, let 100 days in a year be allowed for thefe avoca- 
tions, and (till, in the remaining clays of the year, they would 
fpin, at the above rate, more yarn, than can be produced from 
the 243 packs of wool, purchafed for the current feafon. Yet 
not only are they always furnifhed with as much wool as they 
can fpin, but three machines alfo, with 30 and 36 fpindles 
each, which, at an average, fpin at le^ft 24 flips in a day a- 
mong them, are employed always two, and often three days 
every week. In like manner, there are 43 looms in the vi!» 
lage and fuburbs, 9 of which are only occafionally ufed by the 
aged and infirm, and by young bcyd. Suppofiag thefe o, to 

be 



Statljlical Account 



be equal to 2 looms conftantly occupied throughout the year; 
and fuppofing the 36 looms, thus made up, to weave only, at 
an average 7 yards raw cloth, which is equal to 4-f yards, drefs- 
ed cloth, each day, for 300 days in the year, they would thus 
weave feveral thoufand yards of more cloth, than can be made 
out of the above number of packs. Now, as many weavers 
are known not to be a week idle throughout the year, and 
fome of them, for a courfe of weeks in temperate weather, 
work 12 and even 15 yards per day, the above computation is 
abundantly moderate. Again, every flip of yarn is allowed, 
by the manufacturers, to make, at an average, a yard of cloth, 
confequently, from the 243 packs, containing 2916 ftone, and 
each ftone yielding 16 flips of yarn, there fhould be pro- 
duced 46,656 yards of cloth ; yet, from the moft accurate en- 
quiry, the actual number cannot be found to exceed 43,740 
yards. To reconcile thefe feemingly inconfiftent circumftan- 
ces, let the following obfervations be attended to : ift, Many 
neighbouring farmers referve fome part of their wool, and 
many families in the village purchafe fmall quantities, which 
are fpun at home during winter, or given out to be fpun at 
the ordinary rate. The yarn is fent to the weaver, the web 
to the dyer, or perhaps the wool, from the beginning, is com- 
mitted to a clothier, to be manufactured into cloth. A great 
part of the cloth, thus made, is intended for the market, 
though moft of it is generally for private ufe. Nor is it unu- 
iual, for the manufacturers themfelves, to buy woollen yarn, 
and webs from the loom, to bring forward into cloth for fale. 
Jn this manner, about 30 packs of wool may annually be fpun 
and woven, befides the quantity purchafed by the manufac-

wool in making cloth. A confiderable quantity of blankets,

frocks, are made fefcth by them and private families. And

fome of the coarfefl of their wool is fold, and carried off for 
other purpofes. And thirdly, The weavers, are ocCafionally 
employed in working linens, cottons, and other fluffs, from 
mixtures made of linen, cotton, and worded. As the actual 
number of yards woven annually by them, cannot be collect- 
ed from their memories, or fuch accounts as they keep, it 
mud be calculated, by taking the whole 43 looms, at the low 
rate of 4 yards each of dreffed cloth per day, and reckoning 
300 days in the year, which will make them amount nearly to 
52,000 yards of cloth of all kinds, ready for the market. 

The price of weaving, including winding and preparing the 
yarn, &amp;c. is from 2d. to 34- per yard. Taking the average at 
2|, a weaver earns about is 7d. each day; and the 43 looms 
will draw about L. 1000 a year. A journeyman clothier gains 
4s per week, befides board ; and being in conftant employ- 
ment through the year, without the expence of providing im- 
plements, for carrying on his work, his wages may be confi- 
dered, as nearly equal to thofe of the weaver. 

Of thofe who purchafe wool, and fuperintend the whole 
procefs of making it into cloth, there are 13 mailers, who 
employ, at prefent, 50 journeymen and apprentices, in affort- 
ing, fcouring, and fcribbling the wool, before it is given out 
tolpin; and in fcouring, milling, dying, cropping, prefTmg, 
and finifhing off the cloth. The unwearied attention, which 
they bellow on all the various departments of their complicat- 
ed employment, and the proficiency, which they have attain- 
ed, have obtained for them, many yeais fucceflively, almofl 
all the premiums advertifed by the Truflees for cloth of 5, 4, 
3, and 2s. value per yard. It is, however, on the whole, 
reckoned a difadvantage, that fo many different obje&amp;s mufc 
occupy their attention. In England, there are ivool-forters, who 
buy, and prepare the wool for fpinning 5 fy'mjlers, who buy 
it, and fell the yarn to weavers ; who again fell the webs af-

tcr they are wrought and fcoured. In fome places they are 
purchafed by dyers, and after being milled and dyed, are fold 
again to thofe t whofe province it is to fit and poliih them for 
the market. In other places the perfons both dye and drefs 
them.— From the materials thus becoming the actual pro- 
perty of thofe, through whofe hands they pafs, in the diffe- 
rent ftages of the work, it may be prefumed, that the feveral 
parts of it will be more expeditioufly and better done, to infure 
its felling quickly, and to good advantage. As fpinfters will 
learn to examine the wool, weavers the yarn, and dyers the 
web, before making a purchafe, all of them are thereby fti- 
mulated to take the greater care, to avoid all faults and ble- 
mifhes, which would hurt the fale, or leflen the profits of their 
labour. Befides, it feems probable, that the fewer employ- 
ments any man follows, the greater will be his proficiency in 
them. They, who conftantly and exclufively are kept fcrib- 
bling wool, will work more, and to better purpofe, than o- 
thers, who are accuftomed equally to perform every branch 
of the manufacturing line. In like manner, the fined dye 
will always be given by him, whofe fole bufin&amp;fs it is, to mix 
and prepare the colours, and fix them on the cloth. And the 
fweeteft polifh will come from the hand, which is only put 

forth to the (hears, the teafle, and the prefs. In oppofiti- 

on, however, to this rcafoning, fpecious and conclufive as it 
may appear, fome intelligent manufacturers here prefer their 
own method, of conducting the whole procefs from firft to 
laft } afl'trting, that, from univerfal experience, the yarn and 
webs, which they purchafe, are greatly . inferior to thofe 
which are made under their own eye ; and aihgning, as the 
rtafon of this inferiority, that, having the abfolute direction 
both of fpinning and weaving, and a perfect knowledge of the 
refpective abilities of fuch as they employ, in thefe depart- 
ments, they mint eafily perceive, and can keep out of their 
i webs,

trebs, all faulty yarn ; they muft be acquainted with all de- 
fects in weaving ; and, if they are of a nature not to be cor- 
rected, or concealed by the fubfequent operations, which the 
cloth undergoes, they can make both fpinfters and weavers ac- 
countable for their feveral miftakes, which cannot thus be 
amended. And the excellence of all cloth depending, in a 
great meafure, on the equality of the yarn, both as to finenefs 
and twifting, they have the advantage of knowing and employ- 
ing the hands, which come neareft to each other in thefe re- 
flects, and the weavers, who excel in working finer or coarfer 
yarn. 

Spinning machines poffefs one eminent advantage over com- 
mon wheels. The yarn on 30, or 36 fpindles, is all equally 
twifted, and drawn to the fam- finenefs. And from the na- 
ture of the motion, the twift cannot be hard, nor the thread 
fine, which renders the cloth foft, firm and durable. The 
moft dexterous fpinfter cannot twift fo equally, and fo gently, 
twenty flips of yarn, from wool of the fame quality, as a ma- 
chine can do twenty thoufand. And it is now univerfally a- 
greed, that both warp and woof, twifted as gently as the loom 
can admit, is moft fufccptible of being driven clofe by the 
mill, of receiving the ftrongeft dye, and of acquiring the 
fmootheft furface. 

Artizans. Befides the manufacture of woollen cloth, 

which is no doubt the ftaple of the parifh, other branches are 
carried to a confiderable extent. Ten perfons are employed, 
as fkinners and tanners, who pay, for the white and tanned 
leather, which they make, from L. 66 to L. 98, of excife to 
Government, at an average, yearly. Seventeen are Wrights, 
Who, befides jobbing as cabinet-makers, and houfe carpen- 
ters, and wheel and mill wrights, and making all the com- 
mon implements of hufbandry, drive a very confiderable trade,

by purchafing growing timber, blocking it into ploughs, carfs, 
hay-takes, &amp;c. annually, all which are fold to plough and 
cart-wrights, and farmers, at a confiderable diftance. There 
are 3 black-fmiths, 3 bakers, 5 fhoemakers, and 9 taylors. 
The number of merchants and fhop-keepers cannot eafily 
be afcertained, as almoft every body buys and fells or bar- 
ters. 

Church, Living, and School. The parifh church was 0- 

tiginally fituated at Lindean, to the fouth of Tweed, but was 

removed, in the courfe of the laft century, to Galafhiels 

The living, which is in the gift of Mr Scot of Gala, was, 
in 1775, augmented from L. 800, to L. 1000 Scots, with 
L. 4 : 3 : 4 fterling, for communion elements ; and the glebe, 
(including 9 bolls, 3 firlots of barley, Linlithgow meafure, 
which the minifter receives annually, for a part of it lying in 

Lindean,) will rent about L. 15 fterling. The fchool- 

mafter has L. 6 : 7 : 2 of falary, and from 80 to 1 20 fcholars , 
a tolerable houfe, but no garden. There is alfo a fchool at 
Lindean, with a fmall falary, faid to be a part of the parifb. 
falary, granted when that village was confiderable for the num- 
ber of its inhabitants. 

Heritors, Rent, bV. There are only 6 heritors; 4 of 

whom have dwelling houfes in the parifh, and two of thefe 
four are refident.' Their cumulo valued rent, is L. 8225 113:4 
Scots: And their real rent may amount to L. 1600 fterling, 
over and above all public burdens. 

Poor. — The poor, at prefent, upon the roll, amount to 14, 
(13 of whom are females,) and that number may be taken as 
the average for 1 5 years paft. Several others receive occafion- 
al aid. The fum levied and contributed, for their fupporf, 

annually 



of Galajlriels. 315 

annually, is about L. 30, but it is gradually increafing. As 
moft of them can work, their allowance is but fmall, in 
general, not above 9 d. per week, except in times of fear- 
city. 

Difadvantages. — The greateft difadvantage, which the pa- 
rifli and fuburbs labour under, is no doubt their diftancc from 
lime and coals ; both of which they bring from Middleton, 21 
miles from Galalhiels, and upwards of 24 miles from feveral 
places in the parifh. Notwithstanding this great diftance, 
lime is found to be cheaper manure, and coals cheaper fuel, 
than the marie and peats in the fouthern diftrict, though both 

are excellent of their kinds Want of a poft, is another 

material difadvantage, to which the village is Subjected. Offices 
are eftablifhed at Stagehall, Selkirk, and Melrofe. The firft, 
a fingle houfe, though fartheft diftant, is moft convenient, be- 
ing on the road to lime and coals ; but, notwithstanding the 
obliging care of the poftmafttr there, the arrival of letters, 7 
miles from a poft-office, muft always be tedious and uncer* 
tain. There is a certainty that the revenue, which is drawn 
there, would be at left trebled, were the office removed to Gala- 
fhiels. — A third great inconvenience, which the manufacturers 
Suffer, is want of a ftock to carry on their work to a fufficient 
extent; of confequence, they are obliged to purchafe on credit, 
and at a high rate, every neceffiary article of manufacture, and 
to fell the produce inftantly, at whatever ready money it wili 
fetch. Whereas, were they able to pay at once for all they 
durchafe, they would both have more profit, and they could 
continue to manufacture their goods, without being reduced 
to the neceffity of difpofing of them, till a proper price could 
be obtained. 



Chat-after of the People.— In the parifh and fuburbs of the

village, there nre no lefs 8tok 15 houfes, where alt: or fpi- 
rits are retailed. Yet the people, in general, are fober and 
induftrious in the extreme. Not one is addi&amp;ed to dram- 
drinking or tippling ; and very rarely is a tradefman, efpeci- 
ally a manufacturer, feen in liquor. A refpe&amp;able number 
attend public worfhip in the eftablifhed church, and about 200 
receive the lacrament of our Lord's fupper annually. At the 
fame time, there are many, who adhere both to the Burgher and 
Antiburgher principles, and a few belong to the Church of 
Relief. There are alfo fome claffes of Independents, and 
Baptifts •, befides feveral who difclaim all attachment to any 
fe£l whatfoever, and feem to have no fixed principles of reli- 
gion. Concerning the numbers, and the peculiar tenets, of 
thefe various feparatifts from the eftablifhment, the prefent 
incumbent has never been led to make any particular inquiry, 
from an opinion, that while they are peaceable and good 
members of fociety, and " live foberly, righteoufly, and godly,'* 
the fpeculative points, on which they may differ, are of very 
little importance. And it gives him much pleafure, to find a 
fpirit of forbearance and toleration univerfally prevailing, a- 
mong all tanks arid denominations in the parifh *.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q17407801">COCKPEN</name>. 

(COUNTY OF EDINBURGH.) 

By the Rev. Mr Ebenezer Marshall,</head> 



<p>Situation, Extent, Soil, &amp;c. 
""T^HE parifh of Cockpen, in the prefbytery of Dalkeith, fy- 
nod of Lothian and Tweddale, and county of Edin- 
burgh, extends, from fouth to north, about 2 miles, and 
from eaft to weft, where it is broadeft, a mile and a half. 
The fouthern part of it is divided by the river South Efk ; 0- ' 
ver which, a ftately bridge is thrown at Cockpen. Every 
where within the parifh, the banks of the river are bold and 

beautifully fringed with natural wood. The foil is a ftrong 

clay ; which, with proper cultivation, produces excellent grain, 
and in fufficient quantities. — The climate is dry and pure. — 
In every part of the parifh coal is to be found, and has, in feve- 
rtl places, been wrought fuccefsfully. Good free-ftone abounds 
in it ; and there is a fort of mofs, from whence copperas has 
been extracted. 

Proprietors. — There are 6 heritors ; of whom, the Earl of 
Dalhoufie, has the largeft property. His Lordfhip, and Sir 
James Murray, have their principal feats in the parifh. — The

caftle of Dalhoufie, a building of great antiquity, conftructed in 
the oldScottifh tafte,is pleafantly fituated on the northern bank 
of the river, which runs at a few yards diftance from the foot cf 
the walls. This caftle was modernized by the late Earl of Dal- 
Iioufie, and has thereby loft much of its former venerable af- 
pe£t. The grounds around it are, by nature, peculiarly a- 
dapted for extenfive and romantic pleafure grounds. A little 
lower, on the oppofite bank of the fame river, flood the man- 
Gon houfe of Cockpen ; lately purchafed by the Earl of Dal- 
houfie, from Mr Baron Cockburn, by whom the adjacent 
lands had been inclofed and greatly improved. Along the 
fteep and woody banks of the river, he had alfo formed various 
walks, at a great expence, and in the fineft tafte, which are 
ftill the delight of every vifitant ; but a few bare walls are now 
all that remains of his hofpitable manfion, ferving, however, 
to increafe the wild, and romantic beauty of the furrounding 
fcenery. 

Population. — By a lift, found among the papers of the then 
incumbent, it appears, that, in 1749, there were intheparifh, 
160 families, containing 299 males, and 349 females, or 64S 
individuals; of which, 454 were above, and 194 under 10 
years of age. The return to Dr Webfter was 640 fouls. By an 
enumeration made by the prefent minifter, in 1 ^90, it was 
found, that there were 288 families in the parifh, and 1 123 
individuals ; 5 of whom were above 80, and 195 were difien- 
ters from the Eftabliflied Church. Thus, it appears, that the 
population has increafed 475 in the fpace of 40 years. There 
has been an increafe, even fince 1783, of 123. This addi- 
tion was chiefly on the property of Mr Calderwod Durham, 
and has been occafioned by a very flourilhing coalHery, and by 
giTing fmall feus to induftrious labourers, mechanics, and 
manufacturers. The annual average of baptifms, for 7 



of Gockpen. 319". 

years, from 1741, was 25. For a like period, from 1784, 
it was 30. 

Farms. About 40 years ago, a number of fmall farmers 

cultivated the lands in the parifh, and lived in fome degree of 
plenty: at prefent, 7 families, of that defcription, occupy 
almoft entirely the whole diftricl. They difcover a great fpi- 
rit of enterprize and zeal for improvement, and live in a de- 
gree of affluence, unknown to their more humble predeeef- 
fors. 

Scarcity in 1782,— and the Poor. During the fcarcity 

which afflicled the kingdom, in the years 1782, and 1783, 
L. 43 : 10 : 3 was expended in relieving the neceffities of the 
poor in this parifli. Of that fum, L. 30 was raifed by an af- 
fefiment upon the heritors and tenants. For fome years af- 
terwards, the number of poor was greater than ufual •, but it is 
now diminifhing, and the expenditure of 1789, for their fup- 
port, was no more than L. 13:16:9. This fum is almoft 
wholly collected at the church doors, from the labourers, me- 
chanics, and farmers ; who are, in general, very regular in 
their attendance on divine worfhip. 

The number of poor relieved, from the funds of the parifh, 
at prefent, is H| and the moft neceffitous of them, do not re- 
ceive above 3s 6d. monthly. Even this fum, which is more 
than what is generally given, is but a fc. nty provifion for a 
family, confifting of 2 or 3 perfons, who muft depend upon 
their own induftry, and labour for what they find to be farther 
neceflary. — In the country part of the parifh, inftances of 
deep wretchednefs, not unfrequently occur, from the inade- 
quate means of relief, and the want of employment, fuited to 
the ftrength, or Mate, of the feeble and the aged.

Statijlical Account 



Rent, Stipend, Patron^ CSV. — The valued rent of the parlijk 
is L.306S : 19 : 8 Scots* The real rent may amount to L.1450 
fterling. The minifter's ftipend is paid in victual and in mo- 
ney; and, according to the prices of grain, may, at an ave- 
rage, be worth L. 95 fterling yearly. The glebe, by an ex- 
change of part of it, which is to take place at the term of Mar- 
tinmas 1791, will confift of 5x acres arable, and one of pat- 
ture. The Earl of Dalhoufic is patron. The fchoolmafter 
receives of falary yearly L. 7 : 1, and has a very good dwell" 
ing-houfe and garden. The fees quarterly for teaching arc 1 s 2d 
for Englifh, is 6d. for writing, and 2S 6d. for arithmetic. 

Prices of Labour and Provifions. — "With the improvements of 
the country, which are every where advancing rapidly, the 
price of labour has been greatly increafed. A day-labourer 
now earns from iod to I4d per day. A fervant-maid receiver 
of wages yearly, from 50s to L. 3, and a fervant-man from 
L. 6 to L- 7 fterling. A mafon gets 2s. a day, and a carpen- 
ter rs6d. From the growing wealth and improvements of 
this country, the labourer, the mechanic, the manufacturer, 
trader, and landholder, are daily gaining fome advantage 
bat thefe of {rated and fixed incomes are thereby fuffering p 
confiderable diminution, in the value of what they receive, pro- 
portionally to the rife that takes place, in the price of labour 
and provifions. 

Rotation of Crops.— Every farmer, in this part of the coun- 
try, puts a certain portion of his land into fummer fallow. 
This he manures with dung and lime, and then fows it with 
wheat. When it is thus freed from weeds, and enriched, thr 
land produces, in wheat, from 8 to 10 bolls an acre, and 
fometimes 12. A crop of pcafe is generally taken aft^r the 
wheat, and then a crop of oats or barley. With the oats or 

barley, 



of Cockpen. %x\ 

barley, the ground is fown with grafs feeds for a feafon or two. 
When it is broken up it is fown again with oats, and afterwards 
put into fallow. Turnip and potatoe crops are little ufed, 
and even barley does not always fucceed upon the clay foil. 
The farmers have a ready market for their corn at Dalkeith, 
which is held weekly through the whole year •, and is, per- 
haps, the greatcft corn market in Scotland. An acre of 

good land lets here at 25s yearly. 

M'ifcellafieoits Obftrvations. — A few years ago, a filver pen- 
ny, of Edward L of England, was found in the glebe, and 
is now in the pofleffion of the minifter. It might, perhaps, have 
been loft at the battle of Roflin, which was fought not far 

from this. Sir Alexander Ramfay, of Dalhoufie, who lived 

in the 14th century, is celebrated as one of the braveft warriors 
of that age. The Scottifh youth wereemulous of learning, un- 
der him, the art of war. His gallant behaviour at the battle of 
Otterburn, is celebrated by Froiflart. He was appointed by his 
fovereign, warden of the borders •, and, from envy, was treach- 

eroufly murdered by Douglas of Liddifdale. Some years a- 

go, an attempt was made to encourage the raifing of flax, and, 
by the aid of the Truftees, a mill was fitted up for dreifing it -, 
but it was attended with no fuccefs. There is, in the parifh, 
a bleachfield, which, at prefent, is managed to confidera- 
ble advantage. For fome years paft, a large and heavy har- 
row has been employed with much effect in covering the feed 
upon the clay lands. A fine and deep mould is thereby form- 
ed, even in the dryeft feafon.

the ground rifes gradually from the valley ; the foil becomes of 
a (harper, and more ftoney kind, and then runs out into 
fheep pafture. On the fouthern boundary there are confidera- 
ble plantations of wood ; moftly fir, except on the banks of 
the Oxnam, where there is a quantity of timber, of various 
forts, along the borders of a fmall and romantic glen ; in the 
bottom of which, there is a flat of rich pafture. The river winds 
through it, but occafionally touches high and fteep rocks, part- 
ly covered with natural wood. At the foot of this glen, are 
fituated, Crailing houfe on one fide of the Oxnam, and the 
manfe on the other. This fpot is well adapted for beautiful 
pleafure grounds in the keeping up, and improving of which, 
the prefent proprietor is at confiderable pains and expence. 
The grounds, on the fouth fide of the parifh, are moftly in- 
clofed and fubdivided with hedges, and rows of trees. 

The north fide of the parifh contains little haugh land, the 
ground beginning to rife more immediately from the river. 
The foil is rich and dry, fit for any crop. On the northern 
boundary, there is a confiderable extent of fheep pafture, in 
which, there is a beautiful green hill, called Penelheugh, the 
only one in the parifh. The grounds on that fide, though 
interfperfed with a few clumps of fir trees, are moftly open ; 
except towards the weft, at Spital, now called Mount-teviot, 
where there are large inclofures, with hedge rows and belts 
of planting, and a confiderable quantity of full grown tim-

This parifh is a fmall portion, but, at the fame time, the 
loweft, warmeft, and moft fertile, of that beautiful tract of 
corn country, on the banks of the Teviot, 20 miles in length, 
from Hawick to Kelfo, which is commonly known by the 
name of Teviotdale.

Cli matey &amp;c. The climate is dry and wholefome. No 

difeafes are peculiar to the parifh ; and the people are gene- 
rally long lived. One man died a few years ago, who was 
laid to be ic6. At prefent there are feveral perfons in the 

parifh about 80, and likely Mill to fee many years There 

is a circumftance, which may be mentioned here, as a proof 
of the mildnefs of the climate, and finenefs of the foil of this 
parifh, which took place in the late attempt, that was made 
to cultivate tobacco in Scotland : In one feafon, a tenant, in 
this diftricl:, drew L. 115 for tobacco plants, and afterwards 
raifed a crop on 12 or 13 acres, which he fold upon the 
ground, for L. 320 ; but an a£l of parliament intervening, (the 
policy, or the juftice of which, need not here be entered into,) 
the purchafer was unable to fulfil his bargain, and the farmer 
was compelled to difpofe of his tobacco to Government, at 
only 4 d. per pound ; at which rate, it brought him only 
L. 104. It appeared, f from the trials made at that time, 
that tobacco would thrive well in the fouthern parts of Scot- 
land. 
.' 

Rent of the Parijh. The valued rent is L. 8733 Scots. 

The real amounts to about L. 2500 fterling. The rent of the 
bed land in the parifh, is L. 1 : 10 per Englifh acre. The, 
land, in general, is let, not by the acre, but in the lump. 

Number of Proprietors, Tenants, tsf£ — There are two great

thefe, Mr Hunter of Crailing, refides at his country feat dur-

of Lothian,) has not been occupied by the family for fome

Population. — 1 — The population of the country part of the 
parifh, has, of late years, greatly diminifhed, owing to the 
monopoly of farms. But, on the whole, the increafe is confi- 
derable, when compared with the report made to Dr Web-

State of Agriculture.-^- —It is believed, that there is not, in 
any part of the kingdom, a better fyftem of agriculture. No 
expence is fpared in procuring manure. Marie is got at Eck- 
ford, one mile diftant ; but lime is brought from Northumber- 
land, about 23 miles. And one of the moft considerable far- 
mers in the parifh, is this year making trial of gypfum, or 
plaifter of Paris, which has, of late, been much recommend- 
ed. The marie is fold fo high, that lime is reckoned cheaper, 
notwithftanding the diftance of carriage. The turnip, and 
ev.rf fpecics of drill hufbandry, is carried on here in the

higheft perfection. The plowmen of this parifli, have, at no 
competition, been excelled in the neatnefs of their work ; and 
the farmers are remarkable for keeping capital horfes r and e- 
quipping them to the beft advantage. No fight can be more 
delightful, to one who is fond of a country life, than to fur- 
vey the rich haughs of Crailing, and the fields of Nifbet, in a 
fine morning, during the beft feafons, for the toils of agricul- 
ture. 

Crops. — This parifh produces a great proportion of wheat, 
befides all the other kinds of grain of the beft quality. The 
culture of turnips is much attended to, and with great fuccefs. 
They are generally eaten by fhecp on the fields. The fheep are 
inclofed by nets, made for the purpofe ; by means of which, 
400 or 500 are confined within the bounds of 4 or 5 Englifti 
acres at a time, till the turnips are all confumed. The ground 
being well prepared for the turnips, and thoroughly cleaned 
while the crop is upon it, the necefiity of fummer fallowing 
is precluded, and is, therefore, feldom praftifed in this parifli. 
The flieep leave the ground richly manured, and wheat is ge- 
nerally fown upon fields thus prepared, any time before Chrift- 
mas. There are, upon an average, about 220 acres of turnip 
annually confumed in this parifli, by flieep from neighbouring 
pariflies, and from the Englifli border, which are thereby tho- 
roughly fed for the market, to the number of about 2200, al- 
lowing 10 fheep to an acre. Such turnips, as are not confum- 
ed in this way, (which are not a few,) are given, by the far- 
mers, to their young ftock, both of cattle and flieep. The 
turnips, that are late of being confumed, are fucceeded by a 
crop of barley, which is frequently accompanied with grafs- 
feeds. The crops of this parifli, and of {Eckford to the eaft, 
are generally more early, than even thofe ojf the Lothians.

Price of Labour. — The average wages of a mau-fervant; 
living in the houfe, are about L. 7 ; thofe of a woman about 
L. 3 : 10. The wages of men-labourers, furnlfhing their own 
meat, are rod. a day, from Martinmas to Candlemas, and is 
the reft of the year, except in time of harveft, when they are 
fomewhat higher. The wages of women are, at turnip- 
weeding, and other farm-work, in fummer, "]d a day, and at 
(hearing in harveft, is, furnilhing their own vi&amp;uals. 

Carts and Ploughs. — There are 4S carts and 44 ploughs. 
The ploughs are of Small's conftrudlion ; and though all 
made in the parifh, they are not inferior to his manufacture. 
They are always drawn by a pair of horfes, and one man 
both drives and holds the plough. 

Animals, Fi/h, £sV. — There are about 140 horfes and 350 
black cattle in the parifh. The ftock of fheep is about 2400. 
The breed is between the beft border ewes, and Bake well's and 
Culley's tups. The lambs, for fome years paft, have fold at 
from 8s to 1 is a head ; the wool is all laid, and fells at about 
863 per ftone of 24 Englifh lb. from 3 to 8 fleeces go to the 
ftone. Such is the attention here paid to the culture of fheep, that 
many are bred and reared even on the beft grounds. 

The rivers Teviot and Oxnam, already mentioned, abound 
with great variety of trout. Vaft numbers of fea trout come 
up in fummer and autumn, and afford excellent fport to the 
angler. There are fome pike of a large fize in the back wa- 
ters or deferted channels of the Teviot. There are a great ma- 
ny grilfe, and fome falmon in that river. 

Mineral Spring — The only thing of the kind in the parifh, 
and that even fcarcely worth mentioning, is a fmall fpring 
near the manfe, within a few yards of the minifter's well, of 
3 which 



of Crailingi 329 

Which the common people talk very highly, as a cure for the 
cholic. 

Villages There are three villages in the parilh, viz. Crail- 
ing, and Upper and Nether Nilbet. But, indeed, they fcarce- 
ly deferve the name bf villages, being inhabited only by fuch 
labourers and tradefmen, as are neceflary for the purpofes o£ 
the neighbouring farmers. 

Ecclefiafiical State of the Parifh. — The prefent church and. 
manfe were built about 35 years ago. The church is fmall, 
but handfome, well finifhed, and in good repair. It ftands 
remote from all other buildings, on a fmall eminence near th$ 
fouth bank of the Teviot, where that river is joined by the 
Oxnam, which is about the centre of the parifh. When this 
church was built, the church of Nilbet was thrown down, and 
not a veftige of it now remains. The hofpital and chapel at 
Spital were long ago demolifiied, and even the burying-ground 
there has been totally abandoned for ; many years. Nothing 
but a few tomb (lories now mark the place, and thefe are al- 
moft grown over with trees and weeds. But the burying- 
ground at Nifbet is dill ufed, by all the Nilbet and Spital fide o£ 
the parifh — There are no remains of the old church of Crailing, 
which ftood within a few yards of Crailing houfe ; but the pa- 
rilhioners on Crailing fide, and fome alfo, who have left the 
parilh, ftill infill upon ufingthe old burying ground, although 
the proprietor of Crailing has, in lieu of it, given them an am- 
ple fpace around the new church ; and although their late mi- 
nifter fet them an example, by erecting there a tomb for himfelf 
fome years before he died. — The manfe ftands upon the old 
fite of Crailing manfe, nearly about half a mile fouth from the 
prefent church. The king is patron. The living confifts of 85 
bolls of meal, and a little more than 75 bolls of barley, Linlith-

confifting of lambs, wool, lint, hemp, hay, &amp;c. which he" 
lets at preterit for L. 30 : id fterling. It is believed they may 
be rented corrfiderably higher. There is like wife a glebe of 
9 acres and 17 poles Englifh, and a manfe, Sec, all which are 
in value according to the rate of the times. 

There is no diflenting meeting-houfe. in the parifh. The 
Scceders here are accommodated at Jedburgh, which is abouS 
3 miles diftant. 

State cf the Schools. — There are two eflabliflied fchools in the 
parifh,' viz. one at Crailing, and one at Nifbet. The fchool- 
mafter of Crailing has L. 5 : 1 1 i-f, as falary, and about L. 3,. 
as being parifh and feflion clerk. He has alfo the intereft of 
money, left by bonds for his ufe, to the amount of L. 3 '\i$ 'per 
annum. The fchoolmafter of Nifbet has L. 2 : 1 5 : 6\, as fa- 
lary, and los for collecting the poor's rates of the barony of 
Nifbet. The fchool-fees are very fmall, being, for Englifh, 
is. per quarter, for Englifh and writing, is 6d. and for Eng- 
lifh, writing, and arithmetic, 2s 6d. The annual average 
number of fcholars, for the laft 6 years, has-been 48 at Crail- 
ing fcho'ol, and 36 at Nifbet. 

State of the Poor. — They are fupported by poors rates. It 19 
found, by written records, that, between 30 and 40 years ago, 
the poor in this parifh, in number about 8 perfons, were fup- 
ported, or relieved in their own houfes, for about L. 14 fter- 
ling/)*-/' annum. Of late years, about 14 perfons, at an ave- 
rage, havebeen maintaintd in the fame way,forL. 27 perannum. 

Roads, Bridges, and Boat*. — The turnpike road on the fouth 
Wik? of the Tcviot, betwixt Hawick and Kelfo, pailes through 

this 



of Crailing. 



33* 



this parifh. The other roads are kept in repair by ftatute mo- 
ney. There is a bridge over the Oxnam, near the manfe, 
which is the only one in the parifh. It was built about 20 
years ago, by fubfcription, and is (till in good repair ; it will 

no doubt be upheld by the turnpike funds. The neareft 

bridge over the Teviot, is that at Ancrum, a fhort way a- 
bove. Bui, for the conveniency of the parifh, the heritors up- 
hold a boat, and pay a boatman. To this they are bound, on 
account of the annexation of Nifbet and Spital to the church 
of Crailing ; and on Sundays no fare is exa£tcd,Trom perfons 
attending the parifh church. 

Antiqii'it'ies. — A Roman road or caufeway paffcd through 
the weft part of this parifh, the traces of which are ftill to be 
feen. There are alfo veftiges of two encampments on the top 
of Penelheugh j and that they belonged to the Romans, we 
are led to conjecture, from their vicinity to that road. One of 
them feems to have been ftrongly fortified, and though now 
totally demolifhed, it ftill retains the name of the Caftle. — 
The fite of it is very high, and commands a molt extenfive 
profpecV, taking in at once all the windings of the Teviot from 
Hawick to Kelfo, and part of the feveral beautiful ftreams 
which join it in that courfe. The whole county of Berwick it 
alfo feen from it, and a part of the German ocean. The view 
is bounded on the fouth by the lofty mountains of Cheviot, 
and, on the north, by the Lammermuir hills. 

Nifbet is noted, by tradition, for being a ftrong-hold of 
fome of the antient marauders of the border. Many perfons 
are yet living, who remember the ruins of two ftrong towers 
at the village of Nether Nifbet, and ftones of excellent work- 
manfhip are ftill dug up from time to time. It alfo deferves 
to be mentioned, on account of its antiquity, and the Angu- 
larity of its tenure ; that the proprietor of the barony of Crai- 
T t 2 iing 



332 Statijlical Account 

ling is bound to furnifh, a guard of his own vaffals, for the cir- 
cuit Court of Judiciary, when it meets at Jedburgh. On this 
account, there is annexed, to that barony, the property of 
fome acres of land at Lanton, in the parifh of Jedburgh, which 
is called the Crowner's lands. 

Dij Advantages. — It is a difadvantage, to which the loweft 
haughs of the parifh are liable, that the rivers fometimes 
fwell to fuch a height, as to carry off either the corns when 
cut, or the manure, when lying on the furface, and thus to 
deftroy the labours of the farmer. What renders thefe floods 
more deftru£tive is, that they are often unexpected, and fud- 
den, by great rains falling in the diftant mountains, when no 
fymptoms are perceived by the inhabitants of this, and of the 
neighbouring vallies. 

But the chief and general difadvantage of this parifh, is, 
the diftance from coal, and the great expence of land carriage, 
on that and all other commodities. Although a confiderable 
quantity of fire-wood is annually fold at Crailing plantations, 
yet it is generally thought, that coals are the cheapeft fuel. 
They are brought from Etal in Glendale, and from Rychefter 
on Reid water, a branch of the Tyne, both in Northumber- 
land, andboth diftant about 23 miles. But (till it is fomecomfort 
to obferve, that thefe coals are of a very excellent quality. 

Means of Improvement — The improvements of this parifh, 
and of the neighbouring diftridls in general, have been very ra- 
pid for fome years, owing to the eftablifhment of turnpike 
roads, and to the great fuccefs in the culture of turnip ; and 
it is hoped, that there will foon be an eafy communication 
with the German ocean, by means of the propofed canal. If 
that fhould take place, it will neceflarily lead to the eftablifh- 
ment of manufactures, and thereby increafe the population, 
extend the improvements, and double the value of eftates in 
this part of the kingdom. </p>

NUMBER XXVI. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q6912091">MORHAM</name>. 

(COUNTY OF EAST LOTHIAN.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Carfrae.</head> 



<p>Name, &amp;c. 

THE parifh of Morham is, perhaps, the frnalleft, both 
with refpeel: to population and extent, in Scotland. 
It has neither trade, nor manufactures of any kind ; — it has 
neither mines nor minerals •, — it has neither towns, nor villa- 
ges, nor rivers ; — it has neither any antiquities, nor natu- 
ral curiofities of any importance nor has it been the fcene 
of any remarkable tranfadtions; — confequently, ftatiftical inves- 
tigation, muft be extremely limited, and the anfwers to en- 
quiries of that nature much confined, both as to their kind, 
and number. 

It is not an eafy matter, for a perfon, ignorant of the lan- 
guage of the antient inhabitants of this country, to explain, 
with accuracy, the origin of the names of towns and places. 
Indeed there is no point more undetermined. With a wide 
field, for fanciful fpeculation, there is no regular certain rule 
to direct our refearch. Names of places are often chimerical, 
arbitrary, and accidental : Some have arifen from circumftan- 
ces long palt and forgotten, and, which the raoft accurate in- 
quiry

Statijlical Account 



quiry cannot trace back; and others have been eftablHh. 
ed by trifling accidents, which deferved no record at the time, 
and merit no inveftigation now. The molt obvious, are thofe 
which obtained names from their local fituation, from the 
lord of the. manor, or the proprietor of the foil; and when 
thefe are obvious and apparent, it is idle to trace them to ideal 
foundations, which never exifted. The writer of this paper 
muft acknowledge himfclf ignorant of the origin or derivation 
of the name given to the parifh. But, were he inclined to 
indulge himfclf in conjectural explanations, he would be apt 
to fay, that Morham is the Great Town, or Village ;,for if more 
fignifies great, and ham a toiun or village, the origin of the 
name is fufficiently plain. There is indeed no village now in 
the diftrict, to eftablifh that derivation ; but many circum- 
ftances prove, that there was one in antient times, of confide- 
rable extent. In particular, there was formerly a caftle in 
this place, fituated on an eminence, near the church, of con- 
fiderable magnitude and ftrength ; the rendence no doubt, of 
the lord of the manor, and built, as was the cuftom of the 
times, as a place of fecurity and defence, againft the hoftile 
incurfions of the enemy. A village, in former days, was al- 
moft the neceffary confequence of a ftrong caftle, and a power- 
ful baron. In thofe ages of violence and hoftility, when life 
and property were not, as now, fecured by law, and protect- 
ed by government, it was natural for the lower clafs of man- 
kind, to look for protection from their immediate fuperior, and 
take up their dwelling under the flicker of his caftle, where 
they would not only obtain employment and fubfiftence, in 
the various departments of his houfehold, but alfo a fafe resi- 
dence, and protection againft the fudden incurfions of turbu- 
lent neighbours, or national foes. Although there is not one 
jtone of the caftle, now alluded to, left upon another, yet 
there zxz many people alive, who remember the remains of 

it,

if, and fpeak of it as a large and extenfive ftrudVare. It had 
evidently been of fuch magnitude and ftrength, as to be the 
means of raifing a confiderable village ; for although there are 
only a'few houfes remaining near the fite of the old foundations, 
yet the village had extended confiderably weftward ; for, at 
the diftance of a quarter of a mile, a few cottages {till remain, 
which retain the name of the W eft Gate-end. 

Situation, Extent, feV.— Morham is fituated in the county of 
Eaft Lothian, in the prefbytery of Hadington, and fynod of 
Lothian and Tweeddale. It is bounded by the parifh of Gar- 
veld on the fouth, Yefter on the Weft, Hadington on the 
north, and Whittingham on the eaft. It is about 3 miles 
from the town of Hadington, where there is an excellent mar- 
ket, for all the articles, which the parilh has occafion, either 
to fell, or to purchafe. In regard to extent, it is little more 
than 2 miles in length from eaft to weft, and from one to 
half a mile from South to North ; containing, in all, about 
1400 Scottifh acres, divided into 6 farms ; one of which, be- 
ing of a moorifh thin clayey foil, contains 500; the other 
inv, having good foil, confift of from 150 to 200 acres each. 
The property is altnoft equally divided between two heritors, 
the Earl of Wemyfs, (and Sir David Dalrymple) Lord Hailes. 

The grols rent of the parifh may be about L. 800 fterling. 
The lands are moderately rented, the proprietors being con- 
vinced, that it is for the mutual advantage of the landlord and 
tenant, that their farms fhould be let on fuch eafy and reafon- 
able terms, as will enable the tenant to provide for his family, 
and prevent his fchemes of improvement from being cramped 
and impeded, by neceffity. In confequence of this wife max- 
im having been adopted, agriculture is in a ftate of very high 
improvement, the parifh is almoft wholly inclofed, and will 
be entirely fo in the courfe of a few years. The foil, inclin- 
1 ing 



33 6 



Statijlical Account 



ing a good deal to clay, is not favourable to the culture of tur- 
nips and potatoes : both, however, are raifed in a moderate 
degree, the laft to the greateft extent ; as, befides what the 
tenant raifes for himfelf, every cottager, is, by bargain, or 
favour, allowed to plant a certain quantity for the ufe of his 
family. They efteem this root both a pleafant and nutritious 
food ; and it is one of the principal articles, on which they 
fubfift, for a confiderable part of the year. Excellent crops of 
all kinds of grain are raifed ; but the modes of croping are va- 
rious, adapted to the varieties of the foil. The greateft im- 
provement is that of turning the land frequently, for a few 
years, into pafture. It is found to be the beft reftorative, where 
adventitious manure cannot be had. Lime, of which there is 
great plenty, at the diftance of 3 or 4 miles, is ftill moderately 
ufed. But lime, being a ftimulus, and not a manure, 
has not the fame advantageous effett, when frequently re- 
peated. 

As agriculture is the prevailing, and almoft the only occu* 
pation in the parifh, and the whole of the grounds being ara- 
ble, there are a great many ploughs, in proportion to the extent 
of the diftriet. The number kept by the tenants, is about 
10 ; and, as they uniformly plow with two horfes, the quan- 
tum of draught horfes, can be eafily afcertained •, but, befides 
thefe, there are many young horfes bred, as the high price they 
bring at market has tempted moft of the tenants to rear them, 
not only to fupply their own demands, but to fell to dealers, 
The*e are no fheep bred in the parifli ; but a confidera- 
ble quantity are fed in the inclofed pafture grounds for flaugh- 
ter. 

Population. The return made to Dr Webfter, in 1755, 

was 745 fouls. That number, however, has fince diminifh- 
ed.-rThe frequent union of farms, the ploughing with two 

horfes 



of Morhavu 337 

horfes without a driver, the increafed quantity of grafs 
grounds, the de^reafe in the number of cot houfes, and the 
many improvements and changes, which have taken place in 
the mode of agriculture, fince that period, has leffened the po- 
pulation of mod country parifhes ; whiift the rapid progrefs of 
trade and manufactures has greatly increafed the population of 
the towns. During the laft 24 years, the period of the pre- 
fent incumbent's' fettlement, ending in 1790, there has been 
little difference in this important article but the decreafe on 
the whole, within thefe 40 years, amounts to 55. The po- 
pulation, as it flood in March 1791, was as follows ;

At and above that age - - - 158 

Total 190 

There are, at an average, from 5 to 6 births, from 1 to z 
marriages, and from 3 to 4 deaths in the parifh every year. 

Ecchftaflical State of the Pari/h.— Sir David Dalrymple is pa- 
tron. The flipend has too great an affinity to the parifh, and 
confequently is fmall; but, the real rental being inconfiderable, 
a much greater income could not be expected. The manfe 
and offices are in good condition. The people, in general, are 
of the eftablifhed religion. From the parifh lying in the vici* 
nity of Hadington, there are houfes of worihip for moft of 
the different defcriptions of fe&amp;aries. There are a few Sece- 
ders, but thefe being all in the clafs of fervants, and having 
no uniform local refidence, their number mufl occafionally 
vary. There are none of the epifcopal or popiih perfuafion. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations — There is a parochial fchool, with 
a legal falary. The number of the fcholars is from 30 to 40, 
The Englifh language, writing, and arithmetic, are princi-

pally taught. The fchoolmafter is qualified to teach Latin 

grammar, and has occafionally a few Latin fcholars.- 

There are generally three or four old perfons on the parochi- 
al poor's roll. They are fupported by the intereft of a fmall 
fum of money, and the weekly collections at the church door 
on Sunday. That fund is fuihcient for the claims that are up- 
on it } nor has there been occafion as yet for any legal afiefi"- 
ment. The extent of the parifti being fo exec • dingly fmall, it 
is the lefs neceflary to make any particular obfervations with 
regard to climate, air, difeafes, &amp;c. In general, it may be 
obferved, that the inhabitants of this, like thofe of other coun- 
try parifhes, detached from great towns, the nurferies of li- 
centioufnefs and dhTipation, are fober and induftrious : As a 
proof of which, it may be faid, in their favour, that during ths 
laft 24 years, and probably for a period ftill more remote, that 
nothing has happened to call for the intervention of the civil 
magiftrate. </p>

By the Rev. Mr. William Grierson,</head> 



<p>Name, Situation) tsfc. 

GLENCAIRN has always been reckoned one of the rrioft 
confiderable country parilhes, in the fouth of Scotland, 
for extent, valuation, and number of inhabitants.lt lies in the 
prefbytery of Penpont, and fynod of Galloway, about ten com- 
puted miles from Dumfries. The length, from eaft to weft, 
is about 1 1 computed miles : The breadth varies. To the

darroch, and Dalwhat ; which, are divided from each other,, 
by very high and fteep hills, moftly green, and meet at the 
village of Mmniehive, which is the only one in the diftricl, 
about two miles from the church. The reft of the parifti lies 
on both fides of the Cairn, the name by which the three rivers 
thus united is known : arid Glencairn feems to be fo called, 
from the great hollow or glen, along which the river paflesj, 
and a huge cairn, or heap of ftones, of unknown antiquity, 
where it firft has the name of Cairn given to it.

munion elements, all paid in money. It is the fame now that 
it was about 60 or 70 years ago. With the addition of the 
manfe and glebe, it may be worth about ico guineas per

There is an Antiburgher meeting-houfe near Minniehive ; 
but that te£t fcems rather on the decline. There are likewife 
a few Cameronians in the parifii : but neither of thefe, nor in- 
deed both together, bear any proportion to thofe who at- 
tend the Eftablifhed Church. 

There are two public fchools ; the one for Latin, with a

tion. Thefe fchools ufed to be kept at the church, and at 
Minniehive, four years alternately at each, by order of the he- 
ritors ; but that rotation lias not been obferved for feveral 
years pift. 

Population and Villages. This parifii is fuppofed to have 

been, at leatt, as populous formerly, as at prefent 5 as ther£ 
are very many veftigss of houfes and of cultivation, where, at 
prefent, there are none ; and many farms, of late years, have 
been thrown into the hands of a few tenants, who often place 
only a herd upon one or more of them, where they themfelves 
do not refide. The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 
1794 fouls. There are now about 1400 perfons above 7 or 8 
years of age, and confequentiy about 1700 in all.— No ex- 
a£t regirhrr of marriages, bapiifms, or burials, having been 
kept, it is impofiible to give any authentic information re- 
fpeciing theii mcreafe or decreafe fince that period. ' 

A large addition, however, has been made to the village of 
Minniehive, within thefe 20 or 30 years, by Mr Ferguflbn of 

Craigdarroch'a 



cf Glencairn. 34 1 

Craigdarroch's feus. It is divided from Dunreggan by 

Dalwhat-water, over which, there is {tone bridge. • 

Dunreggan, which is on the property of Mr FergufTon of 
Cailloch, is little inferior to Minniehive, in extent or num- 
ber of houfes, which are annually increafing. The far great- 
er part of them has been built within thefe 20 or 30 years. 
In the two villages, there are 98 families. 

Poor. — Public collections, in particular cafes of great dif- 
trefs, are fometimes made; but the intereft of L. 120 fter- 
ling, and the common weekly collections on Sunday, are all 
the ftated fupplies for the ordinary poor of the parifh. For 
thefe 8 or 10 years paft, L. 30 has been annually expended 0:1 
the poor, from thefe fources, one year with another. 

Rent. — The valuation of the parifh is i2,o62Tmerks. As 
feveral of the heritors poffefs their own lands, it is difficult to 
afcertain the real rent ; but it is believed to amount to between 

L. 8000 -and L. 9000 fterling. There are about 90 farms in 

this diftri£t, feveral of them confiderable ; and frequently uni- 
ted in the poffeffion of one tenant. In four of the fmaller 
fort, two of which are led, (i. e. the tenant does not refide 
upon them,) there are 25 perfons, old and young, 20 fcore 
of fheep, no black cattle, and 6 horfes; and the rents may 
amount to L. 1 70 fterling. This may ferve to give fome idea 
of the value of the whole. 

Antiquities. There is a mount, commonly called a Moat, 

about half a mile from the church, very fteep, and of confide- 
rable height, occupying about an acre of ground, and evi- 
dently made by art. It is of an oblong form, with an earth- 
en turret at each end, having a deep trench on the infide of 
each turret. One of thefe turrets, and the bafe of the mount, in 

that 



£|3 Statijlical Account 

that part, are a gora deal Impaired, through time, by a rivulet* 
There is another moat, or artificial mount, preoifely of the 
fame form, and quite entire, at the march of the parifh, foutlv 
•weft, but within that of Balmaclellan. Concerning the one in 
#his parifh, there are fome fabulous and fuperftitious traditions, 
not worth mentioning. The moft common and credible ac- 
count given of it is, that it was intended to be a kind of watch- 
tower, or a place for the exercife of archery, in times of pub- 
lic danger. 

Lale. — At the fouth-eaft fide of the parifh, there is a loch, 
called Loch-Orr, out of which the river Orr ifllies. It bor- 
ders with the parifhes of Glencairn, Dunfcore, and Balma- 
clellan, and is about 3 Englifh miles round. It is 9 fathoms 
at the deepeft,and furrounds a fmall ifland, where there are the 
remains of a (lone wall, which appears to have been original- 
ly of great ftrength, and contains within it feveral apartments 
now in ruins. Its water appears extremely black, the ground 
under and about it, being generally mofs covered with heath. 
A vaft number of water fowls bring forth their young on the 
ifland, where there are fome bufhes. Eagles have been known 
to breed on it. At the extremity of the loch, there is a penin- 
fula cut by a deep trench. The only fifh in it are pike, (fome 
of which are faid to be about 5 feet 10 inches long,) and a few 
very large troms. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom and Manners. There are no 

manufactures carried on in this parifh, the greater part of 
the inhabitants being employed in farming, droving, handy- 
crafts, and common labour. If the great road from Wigton 
to Galloway were completed, and that from Ayr to Dumfries, 
by Dalmdlingcon, brought into this parifh, at the head of 
Craigdarroch, (which only wants about 5 miles), confiderable 

advantage 



of Glencairn.

advantage might be expected co this part of the country in ge- 
neral, and particularly to Minniehive. That village, and its 
neighbourhood, are much at a lofs for fuel. Peats mult be 
brought at the diltance of at leaft 6 or feven miles •, and coals 
from Sanquhar, which is not lefs than 13 computed miles. — 
Trials for coals, at different times, have been made in lev; 1 1 
places much nearer, with a good profpe£t of fuccefs ; but 4 a - 
ter all, they have hitherto proved fruitlefs. 

The land in general is good. The holms and meadows up- 
on the fides of the rivers, are fertile. Next to theie, ~ ■ 
riling grounds, there is a light, warm, kindly, arable UrA'„ 
and, in the higheft parts, there is fine pafture for all fen. or, 
cattle, particularly (beep. The rivers are very rapid, and of tea 
overflow their banks, to the great damage of the land ggj - 
cent. 

The people are, in general, healthy ; and feveral, now z 
live, as well as others lately dead, have arrived at 80 years oi r 
age, and upwards. Their houfes and drefs, of late, have been 
much improved ; and, in the latter of thefe refpecls, people 
of every clafs feem to be running into an extreme. The man- 
ners of the people, in general, are very agreeable, mild, cour- 
teous, and obliging ; and they are drilinguifned for hofpitali- 

ty, and natural civility to ftrangers. The difeafes, which 

prevail moft, are rheumatifms, and pains in the ftomach and 
bowels ; owing, perhaps, to the low and damp fituation of 
their houfes, moft of which are placed too near the rivers. — The 
water is of an excellent quality ; light, clear, and foft. The 
dreams abound with trout, as the hills do with game. 

Property has, of late, been much divided, by the fale of 
fome large eftates, particularly, that of Sir Robert Laurie of 
^laxwelltown. There are now 27 heritors. Some years ago„ 
there were only 1 8. 

The charity and benevolence of the rich, has in general

been found adequate to the neceffities of the poor, who arc 
pretty numerous, as their occupations, while in health, can 
only fupply their prefent exigencies, and do not enable them 
to lay up for old age and difeafe. The. charge of living, and 
the hire of labourers, and fervants of every denomination, con- 
tinually increafes. A common labourer gets L.6 or 8, and fomc 
L. 10, in the year, befides bed, board, and wafhing ; and 8d. or, 
indeed, at fome employments, is. per day, befides victuals. 
There are, however, as yet, but few who get fo much as L. ro 
a year ; and thefe are commonly fuch as have the charge and 
direction of others, befides working themfelves. But if things 
go on, as they have done for fome years paft, fuch high wages 
will doubtlefs become more frequent. All thefe circumftan- 
ces bear very hard upon thofe, who have but a limited income, 
fuch as was barely fufficient for a decent fupport, in their re- 
fpe&amp;ive ftations, 60 or 70 years ago.</p>

<p>Sititaiicti) and Extent. 
•"T^IIE parifh of Whittingham is fituated in the prelbyterf 
of Dunbar, and fynod of Lothian and, Tweeddalc. It 
extends, from north to fouth, between to and it miles, and 
from eaft to weft, (where it is broadeft,) about 4. It may 
be confidered under two diftintt heads, the Lamer-moor, or 
upper, and the arable, or lower diftric~h 

Lamer-moor. — The word, Lamer-moor, imports, itisfaid,the 

moor which reaches to the fea *. It deferves attention,, 

that, in the Roman province, which was fituated between the 
wall of Hadrian, and that of Severus, we meet with no other 
moorifh hills, that extend quite to the fea. They begin at 
Coldinghame, in the Merfe, and Dunglafs in Eaft Lothian ; 
both which places fund clofe upon the fea, and run weft- 

VoL. II. X x ward,

ward, with a broad furface, from 30 to 40 miles, and a* 
length terminate at Soutra-hill. They are interfered by va- 
rious openings, lying in different directions, with ftreams of 
water collected from the eminencies on each fide, running 
through the bottoms. 

Within thefe hills there are fix fheep farms, belonging to the 
parifh of Whittingham * ; moft of which are extenfive. The 
greateft part of the land, in that part of the country, is cover- 
ed with heath, excepting fome narrow ftripes, which are 
fometimes plowed, and, when the feafon is favourable, pro- 
duce tolerable crops ; but, as it is very late, before the crops 
arrive at maturity, if the froft fets in foon, the grain is de- 
ftroyed. The moft dreary, wild, and uncomfortable of thefe 
farms, is Kilpallet, confiding of about 1500 acres, rented only 
at L. 16. 

Camp. In this part of Lamer-moor, on the farm of 

Prieft-law, at the fouth eaft extremity of the parifh, there is a 
ftrong encampment, or fortification ; all the parts of which 
are ftill entire. The country people are generally of opinion, 
that it was a Roman camp ; but the appearance of it renders 
this opinion improbable ; — for it is well known, that the Ro- 
mans marked out their camps in the figure of a fquare. This 
antient work ftands on a kind of promontory, formed by the 
junction of the water of Whittater, on the north, and Kinf- 
ly on the eaft. The elevation of the ground, on the fide, of Kinf- 

* In one of thefe fheep farms, the river Whittater, or White- 
water, takes its rife, near the outfide, towards the north. It runs, 
with a winding courfe, through the Merfe, and falls into the 
Tweed, about 4 miles above Berwick. It is noted for plenty of 
excellent trout,

ly, will be about 100 feet, and on that of Whitewater, about 
150 : on the fouth fide, the ground is nearly level, to fome dis- 
tance from the fortification, and then rifes gradually up to the 
fummit of Prieft-law. The camp is of an oval form, with 
the broadeft end, which is imicceffible, towards the north. 
On one fide are four ditches, parallel to each other, and the 

diftance, between each, may be 12 yards — On the 

north fide are three ditches, and the outer ditch is carried 
round the whole. The circumference of this military work 
will meafure about 2000 feet. — In one place, on the north, 
the rock is cut in a flanting form, down to the bed of Whitta- 
ter below ; and, it is probable, that, through this paffage, the 
camp was fupplied with water. There are three gates or en- 
tries, one on the fouth fide, which is 40 feet wide another 
on the ealt, and the third on the weft, which are 20 feet wide 
each. It is probable, that this fortification was conftru£ted by 
the Scots, the Englifh, or the Danes. 

Sheep. The pafture, in this part of the parifh, is only 

fit for breeding fheep. The farmers, therefore, every year, 
fell as many of them as they can part with, to the graziers, 
in the low country, who carry them to their rich paftures, and 
fatten them for thebutcher. The number of fheep,kept on thefe 
farms, exceeds 300 fcores in fummer, but is much fmaller in 
winter. The farmers, of this diftricl:, bring annually to the 
market, about 1700 ftone of wool. This commodity has fold, 
for the three laft years, at from 6s. to 8s. 6d. fome at 9s. 
per ftone. The average is from 7s. to 7s. 3d. per ftone: 14 
years ago, the average would be about 6s. yd. or fomewhat 
lefs ; but in 1782, in did not exceed 4s. What would now 
bring 6s. was not then worth more than 2s. per ftone. 

The farmers, in^ this part of Lamer-moor, fell annually, 
at an average, about 30 fcore of ewes, and about 60 or or 65 
X x 2 fcore 



34&amp; 



Stat'ijlical Account 



(core of wedders. The ewes, for the lafl 3 years, have fetch-, 
ed from 9s 6d. to 12s 6d. a head. The whole of thefe fheep 
;ire not fed on the farms ; about 20 fcore of wedder hogs be- 
ing annually brought from Tweeddale, at from 8s. to ics. a 
head. Scarce any black cattle are bred here ; perhaps 6 or 8, 
in a feafon, which fell from L. 3 to L. 5. 

Smearing Sheep. — Smearing is a pra£lice, which univerfal- 
ly prevails throughout all Lamer-moor. A compofiticn is 
made of tar and butter, or oil ; and this mixture is laid on, or 
fpread over the whole body, foon after the feparation of the 
fleece, or at the commencement of winter. It is thought, that 
this greatly contributes to preferve the animal from vermin ; 
to improve, and even increafe the quantity of wool, and to 
fecure it firmly to the body, fo as to hinder any part of it from 
falling oft. This facl. having been controverted, fome ftore^- 
mailers have made an experiment of the efFttls, that would 
be produced by omitting this operatiqn ; and, it is faid, the 
refult was, that the animal was more infefted with vermin, 
more fickly and dileafed, and, that the quantity of wool was 
much lefs, than if frnearing had taken place. Whether this 
is owing to the peculiar nature of the breed of fheep in thefe 
hills, which are covered with fleeces, loofe, open, and mak- 
ing, and not thick, ciofe, and matted, or whether frnearing i- 
neceflary with every fort of hill fheep, has not yet been fully 
Sifeertained. The large Englifh breed of fheep have alfo been 
tried on thefe hills, but unfucceisfully. It was found, that 
they grew lean, meagre, and pined away, and were neither 
calculated for the climate, nor the pafture.

dykes. From the foot of Lamer-moor hills, to the village of 
Wliittingham, the ground gradually defcends, but unequally, 
as it occafionally rifes and falls. The foil on the fouth fide of 
the water of Whittingham, is much inferior to that on the 
fourh. A great part of it is light and fandy, with a gravelly 
bottom. Other parts of it confift of a thin poor clay; but it 
,'hould be added, that there are fcveral fields, in this part of 

the parifh, of a rich fertile foil To the north, the foil is 

of a much fuperior quality. Some of it is a rich deep loam ; 
but the greateft part confifts of deep, flrong, reddifaclay, ca- 
pable of producing finer crops, when the feafon is favourable, 
than any land in the country. But it muft be obferved, that 
this kind of foil is extremely precarious, and very difficult to 
manage to the bell advantage ; as either too much rain, or too 

much drought, renders it unfit for cultivation. The land 

on the eaft of Whittingham, rifes in a flow and gentle manner, 
about 24- Englifh miles, to the top of Blaikieheugh ; but the 

afcent is eafy and inf^nfible. It is remarkable, that the foil 

on this elevated ground, is of a rich, and even fuperior quali- 
ty to any in the parts adjoining. 

Traprene-Latu. — About 1^ mile northweft from the village, 
ilands Traprene-law •, a little hill, or rock, of an oval form, 
Tiling by itfelf, in an open country. On the fouth fide it is in- 
acceflible, and on the other fides, round the extremity of the 
fuinmit, there are the remains of an old dyke or wall, the 
materials of which are large rough (tones, rudely piled up one 

above another It is probable, that it was conftructed, by 

the inhabitants of the adjoining country, in the days of barba- 
rifm, and was intended as a place 01 fafety, when they were 
invaded by the Danes or the Englifh. On fuch occafions they 
went thither for fhelter, and carried their cattle and effe&amp;s a- 
iortg with them.— —This folitary rock was antlent'.y called

Dunipender-Lnv ; but after Mary Queen of Scotland, fo fa- 
mous in liiftory, was carried off by the Earl of Bothwell, to 
Hails-caftle, which ftands to the north, on Tyne river, about 
an Englifh mile below, it was called Traprcnelatv, from the 
two French words trape and reine. From the fummit of this 
law, there is one of the fineit profpecls in Scotland, taking in 
Eaft and Mid Lothian, the county of Fife, the ifle of May, 

the Bafs, the firth of Forth, and the German ocean 

Several years ago, a fmall plantation, of different kinds of trees, 
was made on its fummit, by way of experiment, and incloled 
with a ftonedyke, or wall, fix feet high. The trees fucceed- 
ed very well, while they were fhtltered by the wall ; but, fmce 
that time, they have not made the lmalleft progrefs. 

Seats. — There are only two gentlemen's feats in the pariih, 
to wit, Whittingham-houfeand Rufhlaw; both of them exhibit- 
ing evident marks of great antiquity. The former is moil de- 
lightfully fituated. It is built on elevated ground, furrouncl- 
ed by many natural beauties, improved by theembellifhments 
of art. The adjacent banks, for the fpace of an Englifh mile, 
are covered, from top to bottom, with various forts of trees, 
in the moft flourifhing ftate. Between the banks, there is a 
glen or valley, through winch the Whittingham rolls along its 
gentle limpid flream, in a winding courfe, fometimes ap- 
proaching one fide, and fometimes the other. Through the 
adjacent grounds, feveral beautiful walks are interfperfed ; 
and, what rarely happens, in other places, thev have always 
a dry bottom, both fummer and winter, and are fo conduct- 
ed, that on fome one of them, it is generally pretty eafy, at 
any feafon, to find fhelter from the wind and the florin. 

Village. — Whittingham is the only village in the parifh, and 
. is but thinly inhabited- Within thefe few years, feveral hoii-

fes have been pulled down ; and, it is probable, that feverai 

others will foon {hare the fame fate There is a public 

houfe in this village, which is the only one in the whole pa- 
rifh. It has had no bad effect on the morals of the people. 
There are, indeed, very few, if any, addicted to the vice of 
drunkennefs. The people are all virtuous, and diilinguifhed 
for an unremitting attention to their own bufinefs. This 
may be partly owing to their being fo widely difperfed, and 
being occupied principally with the wholefome and innocent 
labours of the fields, and having feldom an opportunity of af- 
fociating in crouds, or corrupting one another. As their mo- 
rals merit commendation, fo the generality of them are not de- 
ficient in their zeal for religion. The great body of the peo- 
ple have a proper fenfe of their obligations as Chriftians, and 
regularly attend public worfhip. It may be fubjoined, that 
there are few Seceders, or feclaries in the parifh. 

Climate. — Both the higher and lower parts of the parifh are 
remarkably healthful. Lamer-moor is reckoned one of the 
befl and moil falubrious climates in Scotland. This may be. 
owing, partly, to the free and open circulation of the air, 
and partly, to the falutary exercife, which the inhabitants are 
conftantly under the necefhty of taking, in traverfmg the hills 
with their flocks. Befides, the wind, confined by the open- 
ings of the hills, ruflies forward with increafed velocity, and 
fweeps before it every noxious and pef:ilential vapour. 

The lower part of the parifh is likewife deemed extrem- 

ly healthful. It is a dry and open pare of the country, infec- 
ted with no damps or marfliy grounds : It (lands on an eleva- 
tion, of about 300 or 400 feet above the level of the fea j and 
the extremity of it, on the eaft, reaches within 4 or 6 miles of 
the German ocean. The vapours, which are exhaled from the 
fea, and formed into clouds, generally pafs over the level

country, and are driven by tlie winds, till they are infceieep(ftJ 
by the neighbouring hills ; by which, they are broken and for- 
ced to defcend in rain. This circumftance renders the cli- 
mate cf Eaft: Lothian, one of the dried, moft pleafant, and 
delightful in Scotland — It is not remembered, that this parifh 
Las been ever vifited with any epidemical diftemper •, and in- 
stances might be given of great longevity. 

Arable Land, and Crops — There are 56 ploughgates in the 
parifh ; each ploughgate containing about 50 acres of arable 
land. The crops, commonly raifed, are wheat, barley, oats, 
peafe and beans, turnips, and fown grafs ; and the moft in- 
telligent farmers generally take white and green crops al- 
tera itefy. This method of cropping has a furprifing effedt, in 
cleaning, enriching, and meliorating the foil. Turnips and 
grafs crops, are certainly among the greateft and moit valuable 
improvements, which have been made in agriculture. As a 
proof of the flcwnefs, with which ufeful difcoveries are extend- 
ed, it may be obferved, that it is only of late that the utility 
of thefe crops was univerfally known, even in Eaft Lothian. 
It is only about 20 years ago, that turnips were generally 
introduced through the country. A trifling quantity of clover 
and rye grafs feeds might be fown, upwards of 50 years ago \ 
but it wiil not exceed 37 years, fince it became the univer- 
fal practice among farmers to adopt this fpecies of hulban- 
dry 

Markets end Roads The (ituatton of the parifh, for 

difpofing of its feveral productions, is extremely convenient. 
"Wheat, barley, oats, peafe, and beans, are carried, every 
Friday, to Hadington market, at the diftance of from 3 to 6 
miles. — The public roads, leading hither, are kept in excel* 
lent repair. L. 56 are annually laid out for that purpofe,

within the parifh, every ploughgate being afleflfed in 20s. fter- 
ling. This h, no doubt, a heavy tax upon the farmers, but 
it is generally paid with the greateft chearfulnefs, from a tho- 
rough conviction of the great conveniency and advantage of 
good roads. Before this improvement in the police of the 
country) the farmers were obliged to tranfport their corn, to 
Hadington, on horfeback ; efpecially during the winter feafon. 
Now they generally fend, on a double cart, 8 or 10 times the 
weight, that a fniglehorfe was in ufe to carry. The gentle- 
men of the pariih are extremely attentive to this important 
branch of police ; for which, they are juftly entitled to the 
higheft approbation. 

Labourers. — -The labourers, employed by the tenants, con- 
fift of talkers, hynds, and houfehold-fervants ; befides which, 
they hire occafiOnally women and the young of both fexes, 
for hoeing, weeding, &amp;c. The tafkers are thofe, who are 
employed in threfhing out the corn ; and they receive one 
boll of every 25, or the twenty-fifth part for their labour ; and 
this has been their fixed and ftated wages, as far back as 
can be remembered. Through the reft of the year, when unem- 
ployed in the barn, they are generally engaged to fefve their 
mafters as day-labourers, at a fupulated hire. A threfhing .ma- 
chine was lately invented, and is now ufed by fome of the 
great farmers, in this neighbourhood. — The hynds are gene- 
rally married, and lodge with their families, in their own 
houfes. They are er.fy and free from care, having nothing to at- 
tend to, but the bufinefs allotted to them by their mafters. 
The benefit they receive for their labour, is in kind ; and it 
pretty remarkable, it has remained unalterably the fame, as 
for thefe many, years pdt. This is Owing to its quality, 
which is of fuch a nature,' that it' rills in value with every o-

paiifli, it will not be improper to ftate, in a general manner, 
how it is now concluded. Several corn-farms are juft now 
either laid, or laying down in grafs, for the purpofe of feed- 
ing black cattle and flieep. This circumftance, indeed, is 
merely accidental ; and, it is probable, that thefe farms, after 
lying a few years in grafs, will be again converted into tillage. 
But, at prefent, the grazing bufinefs is carried on with great 
fpirit, and to a confiderable extent. 

The number of black cattle, fed on grafs, during the fum- 
mer feafon, is about 200, be fides from 40 to 50 fed on turnips in 
winter.— Of ewes, lambs, and weddcrs, fed on grafs in fummer, 
there arc from 80 to ioofcores. Two-thirds of thefe may 
be fuppofed to be ewes and lambs, and one-third wedders. 

No fheep, at prefent, are fed on turnips in winter. 

Here it may be obferved, that during thefe few years paft, 
the grazing and feeding bufinefs, in this parifh, has remarka- 
bly increafed. It is computed, that, about 14 years ago, the 
number of black cattle, fed on grafs in a feafon, did not ex- 
ceed 60 or 70 ; and of flieep, about 40 fcores, and thefe 
were almoft entirely ewes and lambs. 

It is fuppofed, that the number of black cattle, bred at pre- 
fent in the parifh, may be from 40 to 50. 

The raiGng of turnips, between Whittingham water and 
the hills, is entirely in its infancy, and capable of very great 
improvement. It is expe&amp;ed, that, in a few years, much 
greater quantities will be raifed ; and, confequently, there 
will be a proportionable increafe, both i:\ feeding and breeds 
ihg *.

Heritors, Church, tsfc. — There are 9 heritors. Two of them, 
till lately, refided in the parifh, but have not for fome time 

pail. The church is in excellent repair. The nianfe and 

offices in the fame ftate. The glebe and garden are valu- 
able. 

School— The fchool-houfe is large, containing a proper a- 
partment for the feholars, befides accommodation for the 

ichool -matter's family. The fchool -mailer's falary is 100 

merks, which, with the other perquifites, exclufivc of his in- 
come from the fchool, and a good garden, may be valued at 
L. 10 per annum. The average number of his feholars may be 
reckoned at, from 37 to 40. Should this be thought difprd- 
portionate to the population of the parifh, it may be remark- 
ed, that a great many of the young people are fo fituated ; that 
it is much more convenient for them, to attend other parochi- 
al fchools. 

Po»r. 

partly owing to the grafs ground being better laid down, but prin* 
cipally, to the turnip huftandry, has certainly very much increaf- 
ed. About 14 years ago, both black cattle and ftieep were, from 
10 to 15 per cent, cheaper, than at prefent. But this is to be un- 
derftood of lean cattle; for the fat then fold generally dearer, efpe- 
cially in the fpring fcafon. This difference might be owing to the 
fmall quantity of turnip then raifed, and to the diRillery's not being- 
carried on to their prefent extent. But if the diftilleries continue to 
flourifh, and if fuch quantities of turnips continue to be raifed, 
there will always be a great demand for half fed cattle ; fo that 
butcher meat Iras now little chance of being much dearer in the 
fpring, than at any other feafon. Formerly there were a great 
many bad fed csttle killed at the end of autmnn, which fold very 
cheap, and prevented good and well-fed cattle from fetching their 
value. About 20 years ago, butcher-meat was generally from 50 
to 70 percent, dearer at Wbitfunday than at Maitinmas.

Poor.— No perfon, refiding within the bounds of the parifh 
is permitted to beg ; and indeed, there are few individuals, or 
families, who ftand much in need of public charity. This is 
fo remarkably the cafe, that it may be affirmed, there is hard- 
ly any tract of country, in Scotland, fo large, fo populous, 
and well cultivated, where the number of the poor is fo in- 
confiderable. This peculiarity is evidently owing to the fmall 
number of cottagers. The great body of the lower people 
confdts of hynds and fervants, who are connected with, and 
lupported by the tenants. — The average number of poor on 
the roll, for the lad 10 years, is only 5. They live in their 
own houfes, and the allowance granted them, confifts either 
in money or oat- meal. When in money, they generally re- 
ceive ios per quarter ; but this allowance varies according to 
circumftances. Befides the peNfioners on the rotf, interim 
fupplies are occaf:onally given to other families, who, by fick- 
nefs, or misfortunes, are reduced to neceffitous circumftan- 
ces. The average of the money, annually expended on the 
poor, for the lad 10 years, may be eftimated at about L. 10. 
Thisfum is raifed by weekly collections at the church- doors, 
feat- rents, mort-cloths, marriages, gratuities, &amp;c. When 
thefe funds are deficient, an allciTmcnt takes place. In 1782, 
when the prices of all kinds of provifions were fo exorbitant- 
ly high, that many of the induftrious poor were reduced to 
great ftraits, the heritors agreed to fupply this ufeful fet of 
men with oat-mcal, till the middle or end of harveft, (when it 
was fuppofed the prices would fall), at the r. te of is per peck. 
In order to afcertain the fum neceffary for this purpofe, a lift 
was made up, of fuch induftrious poor, as were thought pro- 
per objects of charity, and the quantity of meal was calculat- 
ed, that would be confumed by every family per week, and 
eonlequentlyj that would be required by the whole, during 
the time, that this aid was to be continued. The nun requi- 
re

lite was advanced by the heritors, and entrufted to the ma- 
nagement of the kirk-feflion, who met once a month, and gave 
each family, according to the quantity of meal" they wanted, 
the furplus of the market rife, above is per peck. 

Population. The following is an accurate ftate of the po- 
pulation of the parifh : 

Males - - 296 
Females - - - 359 

Number of fouls - 65$ 

The return to Dr "Webfter, in 1755, being 714 fouls it is 
evident, that there has been a decreafe, within thefe 40 years, 
of 59 fouls. This alteration has been produced by various 
caufes ; fueh as, the conjunction of farms, fome farms being 
laid in grafs, ethers being occcupied by tenants, who refide 
In other parifhes; two horfe-ploughs.being ufed inftead of four; 
rnoft of the land being inclofed ; many cot-houfes being pul- 
led down, and others empty ; one corn-farm being entirely 
depopulated, and laid under grafs, and the inclofures belong- 
ing to it annually let by public auction, to the higheft bid- 
der. 

Moft of the cot-houfes in the parifh are now pulled down ; 
the farmers being of opinion, that the advantage arifing from 
them, was greatly overbalanced by the expence of keeping 
them up. There is one farmer, indeed, who judged diffe- 
rently from his brethren on this fubject, and has kept up all his 
cot-houfes. He thought, and with good reafon, that it would 
contribute much to the advantage and conveniency of the te- 
nant, to have always plenty of people on the fpot, ready to af- 
{ift him on any emergency. It has been aflerted, that ma- 
ny of the lower people, through different parts of the country, 
difcover a predileitton for the town ; but it may be affirmed, 

as

        PARISH O £ <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1016169">LARGS</name>, 

(COUNTY OF AYR.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Gilbert Lang.</head> 



<p>Situation, drr, &amp;c. 
^T^HE parifh of Largs lies in that divifion of the fhire o( 
■ Ayr, called Cunningham. It is the moft northerly 

parifh in it ; bordering on the (hire of Renfrew, at a place, 
called Keliybn'dge. It is pleafantly fituated along the firth of 
Clyde, from north to fouth \ having the iilands of Bute and 
Cumbraes oppofite to its fhbre : beyond which, are fe'en the lof- 
ty mountains of Arran, with their heads often above the clouds. 
It. is a magnificent prcfpecl: ; the eye pairing over the fea, 
from ifland to- ifiand, till at laft"the view is thus nobly termi- 
nated. To the eaft of the Largs, the land rifes into a long 
range of mountains, which feparates it from the parifhes of 
Innerkip, Greenock,. Kilmalcolm, Loehwhinnoch, Kilbirny, 
and Dairy ; fo that it is a very fequeftered fpot ; and hence, 
perhaps, the common proverbial faying, " Out of Scotland in- 
" to Largs." The air is pure ; the water clear and bright j 
fnows generally melt as they fall, feldom lying near the fhoie. 
There are here fcarce any fogs, while the reft of the country, 
forty miles round, is often buried in them : So that this parifh

has been, by fotne, called the Montpiliei of Scotland. It has 
been frequented a good deal of late, in the fummer months, 
by many perfons and families, for the fake of health or amu- 
fement; and it would be ftill more, if there were better accom- 
modation. From Kelly bridge, the parifh runs nine miles 

fouth, along the more, to Fairly, where it borders with the 
parifh of Kilbryde. It may be very properly called, in gene- 
ral, a ftripe of land, between the mountains and the fea ; and 
in antient times, it is probable, that the fea covered the low- 
er parts. 

Soil, Produce, isfc — The foil, upon the whole, is rather 
light, (hallow, and gravellifh. The land does not produce as 

much corn, as is neceffary for the fupport of the people. 

Perhaps it would be better, if there were ftill lefs corn, and if 
grafs were more attended to ; for the foil, of itfelf, runs natu- 
rally into white clover and daify : and even the mountains, 

which are all green, afford excellent pafture for cattle . 

There is a practice alfo, which renders it impoffible to have 
great or rich farms, or good cultivation, in this parifh ; it be- 
ing ufual to hire almoft all the farm horfes in it, during win- 
ter and fpring, among the neighbouring diftricts ; and after 
the labour among them is over, they are returned home, often 
in a poor ftate, to go through the work of their own ill-judg- 
ing mailers. The faving of fodder, and the making of a little 

money, is the excufe made for this ftrange ptattice. The 

foil is light, the harvefts are as early, and even earlier than 
any in the neighbourhood. The plough is certainly rather ne- 
glected ; but there is plenty of buttrr made, and many Hack 
cattle and fheep fattened. 

Population. — In 1755, there was none who could properly 
make a return of the Katie of the population. In 1 756, the

prefent incumbent took a lift of examinable perfons, or of 
thofe above 8 years of age, and found that they amounted to 
830.|Thenumber,an. 1 790, was 805, of whom 389 were males* 
and 416 females ; fo that the population has not much varied. 
In Dr tVebfter's report, the number of fouls is 1 164. Proba- 
bly, when the return confifted only of examinable perfons, he 
had certain data upon which he calculated the number of fouls. 
The population of the country part of the parifh has certainly 
decreafed ; but the town of Largs, which contains about the 
half of the parifh, has proportionally increafed. The number 
of deaths varies confiderably in different years ; according as 
the fmall-pox, or any fpecies of darigerous fever, prevails or 
not. In fuch cafes, the number of deaths is above 40 ; but 
in ordinary years, between 20 and 30. Inoculation has been 
introduced feveral times ; but, notwithstanding its felf-evi- 
dent utility, the leaft accident tends to discredit it. The num- 
ber of births, one year with another, is about 30. 

Though the Largs lies conveniently enough for fome fpecies 
of trade and manufactures, yet the want of coal, and more 
efpecially, the tax upon that necefiary article, will for ever 
prevent the very exiftence of them. Perhaps Turkey itfelf 
cannot afford an inftance of a tax more oppreflive and more 
abfurd. Among the trades people, who live in Largs, the wea- 
vers are the moft numerous, particularly the filk-weavers ; 
being employed by the manufacturers of Paifley, who have 
been of great benefit to the place*. Fifhing has been much 
lefs attended to, than it ought to be. There are feveral corn- 
merchants, who buy grain in Bute and Cumbrats j and alfo 
import it from the fouth of Scotland, and from Ireland.——

There is no fmuggling worth the mentioning, unlefs the piti- 
ful and occafional help given to the poor feamen, in their little 
adventures, can be called fuch. The inhabitants, in general, 
are a quiet, fober, decent, people. Living chiefly among them- 
felves, they are ftrangers, and fo far, perhaps, happy ftran- 
gers, to the more free and licentious manners of the world a- 
round them, 

Curlcfiiies, Ruins, &amp;c. — Entering the parifh and the (hire 
at Kelly bridge, upon the more, along which the road plea- 
fantly lies, the land, to the eaft of it, which is high, ends ab- 
ruptly in, what may be called, a perpendicular wall of ftonc, ex- 
tending a full mile, at the foot of which is the road, and rifing 
above it in fome places, to the height of 50 and 60 feet, feem- 
ing to hang over it, and prefenting to travellers, the likenefs 
of an impregnable bulwark. It is a (hiking object, efpecially 
in frofty weather, if the fun happens to fliine on it when it is 
all covered over with icicles. This mound of rock ends near 
the houfe of Kilmorly, which is an old caftle, {landing on a 
height, and commanding a noble profpect of the Clyde. Far- 
ther on, are the ruins of another caftle, above the road, and 
feen from it ; and higher up, is a mountain rifing to a confi- 
rable height, in the fhape of a cone, and green to the top ; on 
which there is ftill the veftige of fome work of anticnt times. 
Perhaps it might have ferved for a watch-tower •, for it is too 

narrow for any tiling elfe. Coming farther fouth, the high 

grounds fall off" gradually, Hoping down to a water at the bot- 
tom. That ground is ftill called Forgie-brae, originally, Fer- 
gus-brae. Perhaps it got that name from Fergus, King of the 
Scots, marching up that hill, when he landed from Ireland. — 
The country now opens into a beautiful plain, extending near 
a mile from the fhore, to the foot of the mountains ; where 
the village of Largs is fituated, near the fhore, and furround-

ed with trees. ■ ■ In the church is an aifle, belonging to the 
family of Shelmorly, built by Sir Robert Montgomery, more 
than 1 60 years ago ; which, both for fculptuve and painting, 
does no difcredit to thofe times. Under ground is a vault ; 
where, among others, the body of Sir Robert lies, in a leaden 
coffin ; on which is the following Latin infeription: 

Ipfe mihi pramortiais fui, Jato funera praripui, unicum idque Ca- 
fareum exemplary inter tot mortales, fecutus. 

Sir Robert ufed to defcend into the vault at nights, for his 
devotions; thus burying himfelf, as it were, alive. The Ca- 
farcum exemplar, is the example of the'. Emperor, Charles the 
V. who had his obfequies folemnly performed before he died.' 

Antiquities. The plain above mentioned extends to the 

fouth of the Largs ; 011 which was fought in 1263, in the reign 
of Alexander the III. the famous battle of Largs, between the 
Scots and the Danes or Norwegians *. The hiftorians on both 
fides differ much in their accounts of it. Without entering 
into a fruitlefs controverfy on fo remote an event, it may be 
cbferved, that there has been, from generation to generation, 
an uninterrupted tradition of a battle fought in that place, be- 
tween thefe nations. The field is._ftill pointed out ; cairns of 
ftones were on it, formed, as was faid, over pits, into which 
the bodies of the fiain were thrown. An unhewn ftone of 
granite, ten feet long, once flood on end in that field, eredl- 
cd over the body of a cheftain. It is now fallen down. A Danifh 
ax was found not far from it, and fent by Mr Brifbane of 
Brifbane to the Antiquarian Society at Edinburgh The Earl cf 
Glafgow had another. If any faith could be given to modern

names of places, they would be a proof, at this day, of that bat- 
tle. One is called the Killing craig, another the Burly gate. 
To all which it may be added, that a few years ago, fome 
•workmen were employed to carry off ftones, larger and better 
fhaped than field ftones, from a rifing ground, where they 
were lying in a great heap, and where, it is faid, a chapel 
once flood, in a corner, near the place where the battle was 
fought. After taking away a great number, they came at 
length to three long, broad, flat, unhewn ftones, which were 
the covers of three deep ftone coffins. Nothing, however, was 
found in them, except a broken, brown, earthen urn, and a 
mouldering piece of bone. The earth and fmall ftones, at 
the bottom, on the ground, were calcined. 

MjfceUaaemt Obfervations. — Fairly road or rade, maybe pro- 
perly mentioned in this account. It is a bay that would con- 
tain any number of {hips, fheltered from every ftorm, and 
having firm anchoring ground. 

There is a fair, annually held at Largs, every Midfummer. 
It is called St Cofme or Come's day. In former times there 
waslittle communication between the Highlands and Lowlands; 
at the fame time, they required articles, with which they could 
mutually fupply each other. Hence, probably,' they agreed 
to meet one another, in a common place, for the general be- 
nefit •, and this place was the Largs. There they made exchanges, 
and purchafed goods, that ferved them through the whole 
year. It might be called, a congrefs between the Highlands 
and Lowlands ; and occafioned a vaft concourfe of people, for 
fome days. The fpe£lacle of boats from all quarters, the

cle. Of late, tins congrefs has decreafed much ; becaufc there 
are many (hops now through the Highlands ; and travelling 
chapmen frequent almoft every part of that country. Howe- 
ver, there is ftill a refpe£table concourfe of ruftic beaux and 
belles, from eaft and weft, by land and fea. 

Kelburn Houfe. Kelburn, a feat belonging to the 

Earl of Glafgow, remarkable for the romantic fcenery of 
the glen behind it, is fituated in this parifh. The glen begins 
near the houfe, and about a quarter of a mile behind it, ends 
in an abrupt, rough, fteep precipice, over which a water 
pours down, which then runs through a bottom below, no 
broader than the water itfelf. The ground immediately rifes 
on each fide, and afcends mountain -high ; at the fame time 
thefe two heights are very near each other. The chafm, were 
it naked, would be tremenduous ; but art has converted it in- 
to a furprifing beauty. Both fides of it are planted, and co- 
vered thick with trees ; which have flourifhed fo well, that in 
fome parts, a fhade is formed, impervious to the rays of the 
fun. The water, in its courfe, falls, near the houfe, over an- 
other precipice, 50 feet down, into a vaft bafon, that feems 
fcooped out cf both fides of the glen. A walk goes through the 
whole, which is properly conducted to humour the ground. The 
deepnefs of the fhade, the murmuring of the ftream below, the 
height of the ground on each fide, the depth of the precipices, 
die folemn darknefs, fo favourable to ferioufnefs and medita- 
tion ; all together form a fcene peculiarly awful. All which 
is ftill heightened, by the appearance of a monument of white 
marble, erecled by the late Countefs Dowager of Glafgow, to 
the memory of her hufband : Virtue, holding a lock of her 
hair in one hand ; and, in the other, an urn •, over which ihe 
penfively, and mournfully inclines, lamenting the lofs of one 
of her favourite fons. </p>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5332281">ECCLESMACHAN</name>, 

(COUNTY OF LINLITHGOW.) 

By the Rev. Mr. William Peterkin.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, S*JV. 

THE antient and modern name of this parifh, in as far as 
it can be traced, is Ecclefmachan. A learned and 
refpectable antiquary, (the Earl of Buchan,) thinks it means 
Eccltfta Machani. Whether the church was dedicated to a 
faint of that name, is not certain, but the conjecture is high- 
ly probable. It is fituated in the county of Linlithgow, 

and fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale ; 1 2 meafured miles weft 
from Edinburgh. In length, it is about 4 miles, including 
fome parts of Linlithgow, and Uphall parifhes, by which it is 
interfered. Its breadth is not above a mile. . 

Soil, Climate, and Minerals. The whole parifh is a flat 

corn country, producing all the forts of grain raifed in Weft 
Lothian. The air is mild, and the country healthy; not 
fubjecT: to any epidemical diftemper. 

There is a mineral fpring at no great diftance from the 
manfe, called the Bullion-well, of the fame nature with Mof- 
fat water ; to which, people labouring under fcrophulouj

complaints ufed to repair : but it lias not been much frequen- 
ted for feme years part. 

There are few or no farms in this parifh, in which coals are 
not to be found ; but no coal-work is carried on in the parifh. 
The Earl of Ilopetoun has lately opened a coal pit, about a 
mile and a half norch from Ecclefmachan, in the parifli of 
Dalmenie, which, it is hoped, will be of great ufe to the 
country-fide. There is a good free-ftone quarry at Waterf- 
town, within a quarter of a mile of the church, which the 
farmers ufe in building their houfes. Plenty of free-ftone is 
found in many other parts. On the confines of the north 
weft extremity of the parifh, in the hills of Bathgate, lie filver 
mines ; fo called, becaufe the lead found there, was very pro- 
ducT^ive of that valuable article, a tun of lead producing 17 
ounces of filver. That fpot was formerly the property of the 
Earl of Hadington's anceftors, whofe eftate was faid to have 
been much increafed by the profit of thefe mines. They are 
now the property of the family of Hopetoun ; who have fre- 
quently made feveral trials for lead in the vicinity of, and a- 
mong the old workings, but without effect. 

Population. The population of this parifli, as reported to 

DrWcbfter, for the year 1755, was 330 fouls. It now con- 
tains only 215. Of thefe, 48 are under 7 ye-rs of age; and 
63 are difTenters of one denomination or another ; fo that there 
are 104 examinable perfons, profefling the communion of the 
Eftablifhed Church. The Secefiion, at its commencement, 
flew like an ignis fatuus, through this part of the country. 
Within the bounds of this prefbytery, containing 19 parifhes, 
there are 13 meeting houfes belqnging to the Seceders. But 
of late, they feem to have loft much of that zeal, by which 
they were diftinguilhtd. The principal caufe of the de- 
population in this, and in the neighbouring pirifhes, is the

and throwing feveral farms into one — The annual average of 
births may be from 6 to 7 ; of marriages, rather under 2, and 
of deaths, about 3. There are 1 1 farmers in the parifh, an 
30 cotters. Thefe laft have only a houfe and fmall yard, but 
no land ; and are employed as fervants to the farmers, or car- 
riers of butter and buttermilk to Edinburgh- The average of each 
farmer's family, iso,includingchildren and fervants: of each cot- 
ter's, 5. There is no manufactory of any kind carried on in 
the parifh ; nor are there any mechanics, except 1 houfe- 

carpenter, 2 blackfmiths, 1 taylor, and 1 mafon. None of 

the heritors rcfide. 

Patron, Stipend, CSV. The Farl of Hopetoun is patron, 

and proprietor of nearly one half of the pariih. The flipend 
confifts of one chalder of bear, two of meal, and L. 75 in 
money, including L. 3 : 8 : 6, for communion elements. 

Poor. The oldeft parifh regiftcr extant, commences in 

December 1662. It is fairly wrote in an antiquated hand ; and 
the bufinefs of the feffion, 2nd the application c'f the poors 
money,(which then amounted toabout 6d. ft'erlirig weekly,) are 
accurately recorded. The average weekly collection now a- 
mounts to 'is. and 20 s. are generally collected at the diipen- 
fation of the Lord's Supper. There is a fund alio, of L. 60 
fterling, from former favings. There are only two' old women 
on the poors-roll, who get 5s. a month. 

Lord.Hopetuon, to encourage indufh-y in this part cf the pa - 
riih, gives L.5 a year to five women, to purchafe materials for 
fpinning. The feffion lays out the money in fl;.x, which, when

p School, bY. — The fchool-mafter's falary is 100 merks Scots,. 
(L. 8:6:8 fterling,) paid partly by the heritors, and partly 
by the tenants. He has alfo 20s. as precentor and feflion- 
clerk. His perquifites and fchool fees through the year, wil! 
not exceed 20s. more. No perfon qualified for the inftruc- 
tion of youth, can be fuppofed to fubfift on fuch a pittance, 
■while an ordinary plowman, or bamman, can make at the rate 
of L. 14 or L. 15 a year.— — — The want of proper fchool- 
mafters is the principal caufe of the ignorance, bigotry, and 
fe£tarifm, which now prevail in many parts of this country. 
In former times, the commons of Scotland were jufty accoun- 
ted the moft enlightened people of their ftation in Europe ; but 
they will probably foon ceafe to deferve that honourable dif- 
tinction, if the plans, which are now in agitation, for addi- 
tionalencouragementto fchool in afters, are treated with negleclv 
It is only from the well informed, and well educated part of the 
community, that candour, moderation, rational piety, and 
decency of manners can be expedled. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervat'wns. — No new houfe or cottage has 
been built in the parifh for thefe ten years paft. About 6 
have fallen down, the inhabitants having emigrated to Edin- 
burgh or elfewhere. The wages of a male fervant is about 

L. 15, if he lives in his own houfe, or L. 8, and his maintain- 
ance, if he refides with his mafter. Maid-fervants wages are 
about L. 3, and their maintainance. The circumftances of 
the lower orders of the community, in this neighbourhood, if 
they are induftrious, are, on the whole, eafy. But indolence 
or vice, clothes a man with rags, in this as well as in other 
countries. </p>

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5211630">DAL SERF</name>. 

(COUNTY OF LANARK.) 

By the Rev. Ma. John Risk.</head> 



<p>Etymology Situation, and Extent. 
* 1 ^HE name of this parifh is faid to be derived from Dnl, 
which, in the Celtic, fignifies a plain or valley, and 
the Latin word, cervus, a deer. This etymology is not un- 
likely, as in antient times, it was very probably a place dif- 
tinguilhed for the number of deer, who reforted to it for {belter. 

lit is fituated in the middle ward of the county of Lanark, 

in the prefbytery of Hamilton, and fynod of Glafgow and 
Ayr. The weftern part of it is about 14 miles from the city 
of Glafgow, and 3 from the town of Hamilton : It is about 5 
miles long, and 3 broad, at an average. 

Surface and SoiL ——Between the edge of the river Clyde, 
and the rifing ground, or banks on each fide of that river, 
there are generally valleys, or holms, (as they^ are here cal- 
led,) of -different breadths. The foil of thefe, for a great 
depth, appears to be formed of the mud and fand, depofited, 
in the courfe of ages, by the overflowings of the river, and is 
moftly of a very fertile quality. From thefe narrow plains,

the banks rife, with a very bold and quick afcent, to a confi- 
derable height, and are in many places fteep and full of precipi- 
ces. From their fummits, the land rifes very moderately, and a- 
gain falls a little, upon the weft of the parifh. The higheft 
part of the land is computed to be about 400 feet above the 
level of the fea. The foil of the upper grounds, in general, is 
a very ftrong heavy clay, lying upon a ftratum of a denfe argi- 
llaceous fubftance, generally of a great depth ; which, under all 
its different appearances, is called till in this country, there 
being only a few exceptions, of fmall fpots of a more light and 
open quality. The clay foil, in its natural ftate, appears very 
fterile, bearing only draggling bufnes of furze, with fome- 
times broom, and a fmall quantity of coarfe herbage : But, 
by a courfe of cultivation, and repeated manuring with lime 
and dung, it 13 brought to yield good crops of corn and grafs. 
Some of the fteep banks, already mentioned, along the fiJe 
of the Clyde, are uncovered, and but flightiy cultivated ; 
fome of them are clothed with beautiful coppice woods ; as are 
alfo many of the other fteep declivities, upon the fides of the 
other rivers, brooks, and torrents. On the upper parts of the 
parifh, are large artificial plantations and ftripes of trees ; on 
the lower, considerable orchards are planted : The reft of the 
parifh is all arable, except a fmall extent of mofs. 

Rivers. The Clyde, which forms the boundary of the 

parifh, on one fide ; the Avon, which runs along the welt 
fide of it for two miles, and the fmall river, Calner, are the 
principal ftreams. The bold rocky banks of the Avon, cover- 
ed with wood, are beautifully romantic. In the Clyde and 
Avon, falmon. trout, pike, eels, &amp;c. are found, and in the 
Calner, fome trout. The rains fometimes occafion great 
floods in the rivers. The Clyde, at particular times, rifes fo 
high as to overflew, and do great injury to the lands in the 

adjacent 



of Dalferf.

adjacent valleys. The moft remarkable inftance of this kind, 
was on the 1 2th of March, 1782, when the water rofe here 3 
feet higher than was ever remembered, ^being 1 7 feet perpen- 
dicular, above the ordinary furface of low water,) and fwept 
away feveral mills and mill-dams, leaving fcarcely a veflige 
behind. — There is a ferry boat upon the Clyde, near the pa- 
rifh church, and one upon the Avon, at a place called Mil- 
heugh, but there are no bridges over any of the rivers in this 
parifh. 

Buildings. — -Dalferf houfe, the refidence of Captain James 
Hamilton of Broomhlll, is a neat modern building, Handing up- 
on an eminence, near the village of Dalferf, and commands a 
charming profpect, both up and down the Clyde. Broomhill 
houfe, which alfo belongs to the fame gentleman, and which 
was the feat of the antient family of the Hamiltons of Broom- 
hill, (the elder branch of which were created Lords Belhaven), 
ftands upon the top of the banks of the river Avon, in a fine 
airy fituation, having a moft agreeable view cf the country a- 
round, and of the river Avon, with its pleafant banks. Mr 
Hamilton, induced by the remarkable beauty of the fituation, 
is now building another houfe, upon an eminence above the 
village of Dalferf ; which commands one of the moft extenfive 
and delightful profpe&amp;s, that can well be imagined. 

Villages The village of Dalferf ftands in a low fnug fi- 
tuation, under the banks of the Clyde, having a large fertile 
valley, called Dalferf Holm, to the eaftward ; round which, 
the river makes a circular fweep. In the village ftan'ds a hand-, 
fome parifh church, with a clock and fpire ; and, at fome dif- 
tance, upon the rifing ground, is the parfonage houfe, or mi- 

nifter's manfe, which, commands a delightful profpect. 

This place is famed for the abundance of excellent fruit, par.'

ticularly plumbs, produced in the gardens and orchards a- 
round it. It was formerly the principal village in the parifh, 
but is now fallen much into decay j becaufe the prefent pro- 
prietor does not confider it an advantage, to have a village near 
the feat of the family ; and therefore does not encourage the 
increafe of it, by granting either leafes or feus, the houfes be- 
ing only let from year to year, that a troublefome neighbour 
may eafily be removed. 

There are other two village?, vi2. Millheugh and Larkhall, 
both at the weftern extremity of the parifh, and not far diftant 
from each other; Millheugh being fituated in a narrow valley 
by the fide of the river Avon, and Larkhall, upon the great 
road leading from Glafgow to Carlifle. The laft is now be- 
come the largeft village in the diftricl:, though formerly the 
mod inconfiderable. The greateft part of it has been built 
within thefe 1 5 years, upon leafes of 99 years, and laid out 
upon a regular plan. It conhfts of about 100 houfes, inhabi- 
ted principally by weavers. There are about 6 alehoufes in it, 
(a circurnftance not very favourable to the morals, or the induf- 
try of the inhabitants), where fquabbles, riots, and acts of in- 
continence, are frequently reported to occur. The principal 
caufes, which have promoted the increafe of this village, are, 
1 ft, Its nearnefs to coal ; 2dly, Its being fituated on a public 
road ; and 3dly, The encouragement given to perfons to fettle 
in it, from the long leafes already mentioned, by which they 
obtain a permanent refidence. 

Climate, — The air here is e (teemed tolerably dry and 
falubrious. The inhabitants are not remarkably fubjecl to any 
difeafe, but are in general very healthy, efpecially thofe who 
live temperately, and are employed in the open air. Many of 
them have arrived at a considerable age, and there are fome a- 
bove 80 now living.— -——The moft general courfe of the 

wind,

wind, is from the fouth-weft and weft : When it blows from 
the fouth, it is ofcen accompanied with heavy fhowers. In 
the ipring, cold fharp winds frequently blow from the eaft and 
north; and then there is generally a ftrong drought; but 
when rain fets in with an eaft wind, it is heavy, and of long 
continuance. The drieffc weather is moftly in the months of 
May and June, which is very injurious to the crops on the 
rigid clay, after it has been foaked and battered by the win- 
ter's rains. When the fummer's rains are late in falling, which 
frequently happens, the clay grounds, prepared by the fun and 
drought to receive them, then pufhes up the lunguifhing crops 
with great luxuriance, and this occafions a late harveft.— — - 
When the fpring is dry and favourable, oats, peafe, and beans, 
are fown in March; but the clay foil and clofe bottom being 
very retentive of moifture, and the fprings often fhowery. A- 
pril is fonietimes far advanced, before the land is fit for the re- 
ception of thefe feeds. Barley is generally fown about the 
middle of May. 

Cattle — The horfes, kept for cultivating the land, are up- 
wards of 130 in number ; befides young ones annually reared, 
which may be about 25. There are alfo 10 horfes kept by* 
carters, who are employed in carrying coals, and other com- 
modities, to and from different places. The number of milch 
cows kept, is about 300, and the young ones annually reared, 
probablv above 60 at an average. Some black cattle are al- 
ways fed for (laughter on the beft inclofed paftures ; but the a- 

verage number cannot be well afcertained. There are now 

but few fheep kept in the parifh, owing to the introduction of 
inclofing with hedge and ditch, which obliged the farmers to 
difmifs the little flocks, of which every one was formerly pof-

Cultivation end Produce. The modes of cultivation and* 

rotation of ciops praftifed in this parilh are various. The 
chief of them are the following : The land is fallowed in fuir- 
mer, with repeated turnings; it is then manured with lime 
and dung, or a compoft made up of thefe ingredients and a 
quantity of earth; and fown with wheat in the end of Au- 
guft, or as early as poflible in the following month. The 
•wheat crop is followed by peafe, or a mixture of peafe and 
beans : thefe again by oats, and again oats, or perhaps bar- 
ley and grafs feed, with two or three plowings, follow the 
oats, and after that a crop or two of hay, and then pafture. 
Or, the manure is laid upon the pafture in Autumn, and the 
land plowed, and fown with peafe and beans in the fpring ; af- 
ter which two crops of oats, followed by grafs, fown with the 
laft. Thofe, who adhere molt to the culture of barley, fow 
it after a crop of peafe and beans, with fpring-fallowing and 
dung, upon the croft-land, that is, the land lying neareft the 
farm houfe, which has been enriched by all the manure, made 
there, being continually laid upon it : But the old diftinction 
between croft and outfield is fall wearing out, and all the 
parts of the farm are now moftly treated in the fame manner \ 
fo that there is now lefs barley fown than formerly. Befides, in 
this parilh, which was once famous for producing excellent 
barley, the culture of this grain has, of late years, been much 
lefs fuccefsful; the returns neither being fo abundant, nor the 
quality fo good, which has tended greatly to difcourage it. — 
This has been, by fome, attributed to the wet, backward 
fprings, prevalent for a good many years part, which have pre- 
vented the proper preparation of the ftubborn clay foil, for the 
reception of the feed j and the cold fummers, which have in- 
jured the growth of this tender plant. Others afaibe it to the 
culture of wheat becoming more prevalent, which takes away 
a great part of the manurej formerly beftowed on the barley ;

and other.- again* to the practice of hay crops of artificial graf- 
fes, which, they affert, unfits the land for producing grain 
Crops, till it has been recovered by lortg reft and pafturing^ 
But, whatever is the caufe, the culture of barley, on account 
of its bad fuccefs, is in a great meafure abandoned. 

Beans and peafe have been found to thrive well, in this pa- 
rifh, upon land in good order j but of late, they have not been 
much more fuccefsful than barley. Difcouraged by bad fprings, 
or violent droughts in the beginning of fummer, they grow too 
vigoroully, when the latter rains come on, and run more to 
ftraw than to feed. The prefent crop, (1791,) appears to be 
better than any for thefe feveral yearspaft.In favourable feafons, 
peafe, which"are fown alone on the poorer ground, yield from 3 
to 6 bolls per acre ; and, beans, or beans with a mixture of 
peafe, fown on better land, from 5 to 10 bolls, each boll con- 
taining fomewhat more than 4 Winchefter bufhcls. 

Wheat and oats are the chief crops. Wheat fuccceds weli 
in the ftrong foil, and yields grain of a good quality. The 
produce of an acre is commonly from 25 to 50 Winchefter 
bufhels. The greateft danger, to which it is fubjefted, is 
from fevere froftc in the beginning of the fpring, while the clay is 
foft, and drenched with rain-water, which fwellsthe ground, 
and throws out the roots of the wheat. This was lately the 
cafe for three years fucceffively, to wit, 1783, 1784, and 1785, 
when the wheat crops were much injured, and produced very 
poor returns. Oats are hardy, and fucceed with lefs manurs 
and culture. The moft favourable circumftance, for this 
crop, is, when the particles of clay have been well leparated^ 
by the winter's froft, and the feedtime dry. This enables 
the foil to refift the fumrner's drought. The produce of an 
acre of oats, is from 25 to 60 bulhcls ; of an acre of hay, 
from 1 to 2 tons. 

The clay foil is not very favourable for the culture of pota-

toes ; but in the vallies, where this root fucceeds exceeding 
well, and U of an excellent quality, it has been carried to 
confiderable extent, and with great fuccefs. The produce of 
an acre has been found to weigh, from 12 to 13 tons, and ge- 
nerally fells, upon the ground, at from L. 10 to L. 14 fterhng. 
Indeedevery where thehufbandmen cultivate them lefs ormore; 
and where circumftances admit, raife them, not only for the 
ufe of their families, but for feeding cattle, particularly milch- 
cows : The inhabitants of the villages alfo, rent fpots of land in 
their neighbourhood, by the year, for raifing this root. 

The management of the dairy, in making butter andcheefe, 
and fattening calves, has been diligently ftudied, and much 
improved, in this parifh, particularly of late years. The annual 
profits, on a milch cow, are from L.3 to L. 4. 

Having no map, or general meafurement of the parifh, it 
is impoffible to give an accurate account of the quantity of 
land, annually applied to any particular purpofe, or of the a- 
verage quantity of every particular article of produce; but 
it is certain, that the quantity of provifions raifed, is confide- 
rably more, than what is neceffary to maintain the inhabi- 
tants, f 

There is a little flax raifed for domeftic ufe ; but the far- 
mers think it not a fure crop on ftiff clay. 

The cultivation of apples, pears, plumbs, &amp;c. has, perhaps, 
been carried tono as great extent, and withasmuch fuccefs here, 
as in any part in Scotland. All around the village of Dalferf, 
extenfive orchards are planted, and every hedge and fence is 
filled with plumb trees; even the tenants along the fides of 
the Clyde, have, all large orchards near their houfes. The 
fruit generally come to great perfection, and are exceedingly 
well flavoured. The whole are, feme years, worth about 
L 400 fterling, and are moftly fold at Glafgow and Paifley ;

to which markets a great deal of fmaller fruit, fuch as goofe- 
berries and currants are alfo fent. 

The natural coppice woods confift chiefly of oaks, afh, elm, 
birch and elder, and are cut down once in 30 years. The 
trees that are fufFered to ftand, near the river Clyde, particu- 
larly planes, oak, and afh, grow to a great fize. On the up- 
per parts of the parifh, are large plantations of Scots fir, 
which thrive very well *, but the larix fucceeds ft 111 better. 

"Within thefe 30 years, the land lws all been inclofed with 
hedge and ditch ; but few of the fences can be faid to be fuf- 
ficient, and many of them never will. The face of the pa- 
rifh, however, is greatly changed to the better. Fields, which 
were covered with furze, broom, &amp;c. arc now cleared of 
thefe incumbrances, and rendered fit, either for tillage or paf- 
ture. The large belts, and clumps of planting, have added, 
not only to the beauty, but alfo to the fertility of the country. 
The farm houfes, formerly mean, are now built in a neat and 
commodious manner, and make a decent appearance. From 
the improvement made upon the land, by the induftry of die 
tenants, as well as from the increafed price of the produce, the 
value of ground is fo much augmented, that fome farms, 
which, about 30 years ago, rented at L. 12 or L. 15. a year, 
are now let at L. 70 or L. 80, and the tenants are now in a bet- 
ter condition than before. 

Rent. — The valued rent of the parifh is L. 3320 Scots. 1 

Farms are rented, for the courfc of a 1 9 years leafe, at from 
5s. to 30s. fterling, per acre. But fmall parcels of rich, or 
highly improved land, fometimes let for a few years, at L. 3 
or L. 4 per acre. 

Population. — The number of inhabitants in this parifh has 
«f late years, been confiderably increafed, owing chiefly to the 
3 B 2 increafe

increafe of the village of Larkhall. In 1755, they amounted? 
to 765 fouls, and now to about 1 100. Of thefe there are 100 
yeavers, 16 mafons, 16 joiners and carpenters, 8 Ihoemakers, 
9 taylors, 4 blackfmiths, 4 fhopkeepers, 4 millers, 1 furgeon, 
1 dyer, 1 fpinner on a cotton jeany, 9 inn keepers, and 35 

coalminers From the regifter of births and mort- cloths, 

■which, for many reafons, muft be inaccurate and incomplete, 
it appears, that the births, at an average, are about 30 and 
the burials 20, every year. 

Ecclejinjfical State The Duke of Hamilton is patron. The 

ftipend is from L. 80 to L. 90 fterling yearly, befides the manfe 
and glebe. No augmentation has been obtained, fince the 
commencement of the prefent century, except a fmall addition to 
the glebe.- — The generality of the inhabitants are of the e- 
ftablifhed church, and there is no other place~cf worfhip in the 
parifh. There are, however, a few feclaries of different de- 
nominations. 

Poor. — As vagrant begging has been always regarded as ve- 
ry pernicious to fociety, it has been the wifh of this parifh to 
difcournge it as much as poffible, and hence it has been led to 
maintain its poor, by an affeffment or ftent laid upon the in- 
habitants, according to their ability. This affeffment, for fe- 
veral years paft, has amounted to L. 44 : 4. yearly. There are 
at prefent 12 people, who receive regular monthly fupplies, be- 
fides fome others, who receive occafional afiiftarice, according 
to incidental neceffity, and others again who get their houfe- 
yents paid. 

It were rather to be wifhed, that the poor could be 
maintained by voluntary contributions, than by affeffment. 
The latter method has a tendency to increafe their num- 
ber and to encourage diffipation and idlenefs. It extin-

receive it as a right The poors rates are now feverely felt in 
England, and every method ought to be taken to prevent their 
becoming fo burdenfome in Scotland, which is fo much lefs 
able to afford it. 

School— No houfe has hitherto been built in this parifh, for 
a fchool-houfe ; but the eftablifhed fchool-maftcr has a falary 
of 200 merks Scots, befules the perquifites he enjoys, as pre- 
centor, feflion-clerk, and collector of poors-rates. He is qua- 
lified to teach Englifh, Latin, writing, arithmetic and book- 
keeping. The fcholars are from 40 to 60 in number ; the 
fchool wages are, for Englifh, is 6d. per quarter; for writ- 
ing, arithmetic, and Latin, 2s 6d. per quarter. 

Parifh fchools, with teachers properly qualified, are of 
great importance, and ought to be encouraged, by giving fuf- 
ficient appointments. In thofe pariihes, where, from the 
fmallncfs of the encouragement, only ignorant, low-minded 
fchool -matters, unfitto teach any thing but a poor fmattering, can 
be had, the children of the peafantry are doomed to perpetual 
ignorance and obfeurity. But in places, where there are 
teachers, liberally educated, and capable of inilrucling youth 
in the important parts of education, perfonsof the loweit birth 
have rifen to eminence and rank. 

Minerals. — Coal is found here in great abundance, there 
being no lefs than 4 coal works in the parifh, two on the 
weft, from which a great part of the town of Hamilton is fup- 
plied ; one in the center of the parifh, and one upon the 
fouth. Coal fells at the pit, at from 2s. to 2s 6d per ton. — 
Lime has only been found in one place, viz. in the lands of 
Broomhill ; none of which is fold, as the proprietor retains it

all for his own eftate : The reft of the parifh is, therefore, 
ferved with that commodity, from the neighbouring parifh of 
Lefmahagow, where it abounds. Large beds of freeftone are 
found every where in this parifh ; of this there are feveral va- 
rieties, all generally of a fine grain, and fair colour. Iron 
ftone is alfo plentiful, and the waters of feveral fprings are fo 
ftrongly tinctured with it, as to depofit confiderable quantities 
of ore in their courfe. 

Antiquities. — In a beautiful valley upon the Clyde, a little 
above Dalferf village, formerly flood a Romifh chapel, dedi- 
cated to St Patrick, from whence the valley takes the name of 
Dalpatrick. The veftiges of this chapel are ftill to be feen. —

<p>Name, Situation, Extent, £sV. 

THE origin of the name, Dunoon, cannot well be afecr- 
taincd. Buch man, in the only mention he makes of 
it, in his hiftory of Scotland, calls it Novio-dunum, deriving it 
from dun, a caftle, and nuadh, new. Others afiert, that the 
caftle of Dunoon was formerly a nunnery, and that it comes 
from the Gaelic word, Dun-no-oigh, which fignifies the houfe 
9( the virgins. To Dunoon, the parifh of Kilmun is an- 
nexed, which is evidently derived from the church or cell, 
dedicated to St Mun. His burial place is called Sith-Mhurt, 
that is, Mun's burial place, or place of reft ; and the very 
bay on which it is fituated, feems to h?ve been confecrated, 
being known by the name of Loch-fpcant, or the holy loch. 

Thefe two parilhes, at prefent united, lie in the prefby- 

tery of Dunoon, in the fynod and (hire of Argyle, on the weft 
fide of the firth of Clyde, and in that diftrict of the fhire of 
Argyle, called Cowal. The extent of thefe parifhes may be 
reckoned about 16 computed, or 24 meafurcd miles in length, 
and, at an average, 2 in breadth. The general appearance of 

the

the country is agreeable. It enjoys an extenfive profpe£l of 
the firth of Clyde ; at the opening of which, (lands the rock 
of Ailfa, about 30 miles from Dunoon, by which, on that 
fide, the view is terminated. The foreign and coafting trade 
of the Clyde, are perpetually paffing, and along the coaft, 
the hills are fkirted with woods of cohfiderable value. The 
ploughed part of the ground in the parifh, is, in general, light 
and fandy, and was once, it is believed, covered with the fea; 
in particular, the banks, about Toward, exhibit rocks that 
were evidently dallied by the waves*. 

Cajlle, and Village of Dunoon. The caftle of Dunoon 

was once a royal caflle, of which, the family of Argyle were 
conftables. They, at one period, lived there, and many of 
their vaffals had houfes built in the village of Dunoon, for 
their refidence, when they attended the court of their chef- 
tain. Thefe circumftances, with the ferry towards Greenock* 
and the parifh church, gave rife to the village. Near the caf- 
tle, is tom-a-nthoidy or the hill of the court of juftice, and 
cufpars, or the butts, for (hooting with the bow and the ar- 
row. The butts are now down, but the field where they 
were placed, though plowed, ftill bears that name. The vil- 
lage of Dunoon was alfo the place where the bifhops of Ar- 
gyle refided, in the laft period of Epifcopacy in Scotland, in- 
ftead of the ifland of Lifmore. It contains fomewhat more 
than 30 families; but is deduced in regard to the number of its 
inhabitants, from what it was fome years ago. For half a 

century, 

* It is probable, that the mount on which the caflle of Dunoon 
is fituated, was once furrounded by the fea ; and the minifter's 
glebe has a bank of fandy clay in it, which feems to have been for- 
med by the fea. 



of Dunoon. 



Century, it has been the refort of a few trades people, and of 
fuch farmers in the neighbourhood as have failed, with poor 
widows, who find here, more readily than elfewhere, a houfe, 
with a little ground for grain, fuited to their circumftances. 
This, the tenants in the neighbourhood plough, and the plow- 
ed ridge, or rood, is let at the rate of 7 merks, or 30s an acre, 
with 4 merks for a cow's grafs. This is the only grazing for 
milch-cows, let by itfelf, it is believed, in the parifli, and 
has Hood at the fame rent for thefe 50 years. Such cattle as 
are grazed for fattening or keeping, pay, as in other places, 
from 5 s. to 6s. for the young, and from 20s to 21s. for older 
cattle, during the fummer half year. 

There is no creek, or fhelter of any confequence, or fafety, 
•^ven for boats, at or near this village, which has probably con* 
tributed to its want of improvement. An attempt was made, 
once and again, to build a pier upon its fhorc ; but from its o- 
pennefs to the fouth, and the feverity of the ftorms of winter, 
the la ft attempt, about 15 years ago, was rendered abortive. 
—1 — There was alfo an attempt to eftablifh an Ofnaburgh ma- 
nufacture ; but, after having been puflied for feveral years, it 

alfo failed The people then took to the diftilling of whilky, 

which, after being carried on to fome extent, was at once fup- 
preffed, by the harfh regulations of the Excife. It was a mi- 
ferable trade ; but, at the fame time, the poor people feem 
to have been too harfhly dealt with, fince they were at once 
deprived of the only means of their cuftomary fupport, and of 
their whole ftock and income, without any compenfation, or 
putting any other means of gaining a livelihood in their power. 

In former times, the ferry at Dunoon was the principal 
inlet from the low country to Argylefhire. This made it more 
a place of refort. But a great road being carried by Lochlo- 
mond, round the head of Lochlong, and through Glencroe to 
Inverary, this has contributed to diminifh the population of"

Dunoon. But were more acres and roods of land let out, more 
inhabitants would probably gather to it,and it might become the 
feat of fome ufeful manufacture. The people, that are year- 
ly removing to Greenock, would here find, at the rent they 
pay, for a fmall and confined lodging in that town, the grazing 
of a cow, with a little ground for fowing grain, and room for 
planting a few potatoes, with a garden to afford them vegetables, 
ahut to live in, and nearly as good accefs to fifhing as anywhere, 

Fifhing. — Within the Firth of Clyde, particularly upon the 
{hore of Dunoon, fifh, more efpecially what are called, ground 
fifh, do not feem to be in abundance, excepting when herring* 
frequent the lochs. Other fifh feem then in greater plenty to at- 
tend them ; though even then, they do not feem fo abundant 
as, in general, to encourage the north country fifhers, who have 
frequented our fhores for fome years paft, to lay their long lines 
within the firth. But in the more open fea, at the mouth of 
Lochfine, about 20 or 30 miles hence, or upon the coaft of 
Bute and Arran, about the fame diftance, fifh of the bed kinds 
are to be got. The villagers of Dunoon, alfo, find a coarfe fifh, 
called Seath, which may be caught with rods and fhort lines, 
all the fummer over, when the weather is good, at rocks a- 
bout a cannon-fhot, at fea, off the caflle of Dunoon. But our 
people are far from being fo fkillful and induftrious, as the 
north country fifhers, who have come annually for fome time 
paft, and in greater numbers from year to year ; but have as- 
yet got no fixed refidence on this coaft. They were, at firft, 
brought to fifh falmon in the bays, and that ftillfeems to be their 
principal object ; but, when the feafon for fifhing falmon r 
which continues only for about 3 months in fummer, is over, 
if herrings have not become an object to them, they betake 
themfelves to the fifhing of ground-fifh, and carry them from 
*he diftance of, from 30, 40, or perhaps 50 miles, to Glaf- 

gow 



of Dunoon. 387 

gow, ami feem to find it for their advantage. But our people, 
though the Northlanders are f.iid to be enriching themfelves 
by the practice, do not feem inclined to follow their example, 
in fifhing at all times, or for all forts of fifli, though they are 
accuftomed to, and fond of the fifhing of herrings. This is fo 
much the cafe, that many of them, bred to trades, as weav- 
ing, fhocmaking, &amp;c. leave off thefe fedentary employment. 1 ;, 
and beftow a confiderable part of the year, in feeking for 
herrings, upon our own fhores, or|hiring themfelves to the bufi- 
fifhing to the northward. This, with the foreign or coafting 
trade from Clyde, takes many of our young men out of the 
country, and makes our tradefmen quit their looms, &amp;c. for 
the more chearful, and probably more profitable employments 
of the fea. 

Price of Labour. — The benefit, or the pleafure, that is found 
by the common people, in following the fea line, makes fer- 
vants wages to be rather high ; and, indeed, it is very diffi- 
cult, to find labourers and fervants, for any hire that can be of- 
fered. Full grown young men get L 6 a year, or more, and 
with the fhepherds, perhaps to the value of L. 7 or L. 8. — 
Of male-fervants, young and old, there may be about 30, that 
get from perhaps L. 3 to L. 6, or L. 7 ; and from 60 to 68 
young women fervants, who get from 15s to L. 3. 

Poor.—— The poor of the parifli, (i. e. fuch as get any sf- 
fiftance from the poors box) amount to 40 or upwards, chief- 
ly old and infirm widows, and fome oi'them bed-rid. A 

fhare of the collections at the church doors, being the only 
public charity they receive, is not fufficientt in general, to pay 
the rent of the hut wherein they live, and to purchafe a pair 
of fhoes for the winter. They are fupported moftly by the 
private donations of the more opulent in the pariih, who would 
3C 2 have

have found the maintainance of their own poor an eafy bur- 
den, had the gentlemen of the county at large, exerted them- 
felves to fupprefs beggars, atleaft, without the bounds of their 
refpe£tivepari{hes,which might have been eafily effected. Thefy- 
nod of Argyle attempted it within thefe 15 or 20 years, and 
prevailed upon the Jufttces, at their public meetings, to make 
regulations concerning it; and many individuals in the county 
were achve in carrying thefe regulations into execution ; in- 
fomuch, that a {hanger beggar, for 2 or 3 years, was not to 
be feen. But the country was not yet ripe for carrying fuch 
a plan into effect. Perhaps there were too many tenants in the 
country, within a ftep of beggary, to make it defirable to be too 
rigorous. Whether this was the caufe or not, all regulations to 
check indiscriminate begging, have, for fome years, been en- 
tirely laid aiide, 

Char after of the People — The people of the parifli are juftly 
accounted fober, inoffenfive, and difcreet ; refpec~lful to their 
f •: riors, charitable to one another, and the young remarka- 
bly attentive to their parents, who often ft and in need of their 

afiiflance, when they grow old The general relaxation of 

manners, that has, perhaps, been increafmg here, as well as elfe- 
where, for thefe 30 years paft, with the near neighbourhood 
of a much frequented feaport town, may lead the young peo- 
ple to affemble oftener together, and lengthen out their meet- 
ings to a later hour, than they were accuftomed to do, 40 or 5^ 
years ago. But thefe indulgences do not feem to be attendee 
with any very bad confequences. The people cu the whole, 
are not remarkable for any thing vicious. Many of them are 
lively, fhrewd, and fit for carrying on the common bufinefs of 
the country, and gradually emancipating themfelyes from all 
the bad effects attendant on the feudal admhriftration. 

Language. 



q/ Dunoon. 



389 



Language — The language of the parifli is changing much, 
from the coming in of low-country tenants, from the conftant 
intercourfe our people have with their neighbours , but above 
all, from our fchools, particularly, thofe eltablifhcd by the So- 
ciety for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. Hence the Eng- 
lifh or Scottifh language is univerfally fpoke by almoll all ages, 
and fexes. But the Gaelic is ftill the natural tongue with 
them, their firefide language, and the language of their devo- 
tions. They now begin, however, to attend public worfhip in 
Englifh as well as Erfe, which 30 years ago they did not do. 

Schfols. — There are at leaft 8 fchools in the parifli, for teach- 
ing to read and write ; fome of them are held only in winter, 
but four of them all the year round. The winter fchools are 
taught by children from 12 to 15 years of age, who go from 
houle to houfe, for about 20s. and their maintainance, to teach 
younger children than themfelves; and it is furprifing with 
what fuccefs they go through that bufinefs. 

Eccleftaflical State The ftipend is about L. 83, with a 

manfe, a glebe of about 10 acres, and a garden. The church 
of Dunoon is in a ftate of but indifferent repair. Kilmun kirk, 
where is the burial place of the family of Argyle, is kept in 
much better order. The Duke of Argyle is patron. 

Fuel. — Peats are the fuel generally ufed by the common 
people, and formerly alfo by the gentry, when they had more 
tenants, and when they were lefs ufefully employed, for them- 
lelves and their landlords. Now, coals brought from Glaf- 
are generally burnt by the gentry, and fometimes alio by the 
common people, particularly thofe who lie upon the fliore, 
who find the getting of peats more expenfive than it ufed 
to be, and uncertain, from the weather, which, for fome 

years 



Statijlical Account 



years paft, has been unfavourable to getting peats properly 
brought home and dried, particularly laft fummer and harveft, 
•when the rain was almoft perpetual. 

Climate— Though in this part of country, we have had, for 
a good many years, a great deal of rainy weather, (in which 
Iiowever, we do not feem to be fingular,) yet the parifh, on the 
■whole, cannot be called unhealthy. We have commonly no 
liicknefs, or fatal diftemper, except from old age, and the com- 
plaints peculiar to children ; and even thefe laft, are not, in 
general, fatal. Epidemical diftempers are lefs felt here, than 
jfi mod other places. The fea fortunately intervenes with the 
more frequented parts of the country, and thefe complaints, 
commonly coming round the heads of our lochs, are much 
fpent, and their violence often gone, before they can reach 
as. 

Drefs, £sV. Our neighbourhood to Greenock leads our 

young people to be expenfive in their attire, and to imitate 

:h as affe£r. the manners and drefs of thofe who rank 
Jngher than themfelves. The young woman, who 50 years a- 
go, thought of endeavouring to make 100 or 200 merks for 
Iier portion, now finks all the money (he makes, in drefs and 
crnament. The fcarlet cloak, that only covered the {boulders 
of our ladies 5 c years ago, now falls down to the heels of the 
fervar?t maids; and manyof them purchafe a filk gownto bemar- 
ried in. The young men alfo, though more attentive to the 
gathering of a fmall ftock before marriage, than the maids are, 
generally have an Englifh cloth coat for Sunday, and a watch 
in their pocket. The native Highlanders, it is remarked, in 
general, feem fonder of drefs and fhow, than the Southland 
fliepherds that have come amongft us. Thefe laft alfo are faid 
to be more thrifty in houfe-keeping, and confequently can 
2 f*ve 



of Dunoon. 



fave more of the produce of their farms, than the Highlanders, 

are yet accuftomed to. It is likely that the Lowl'nders 

example will be followed in that, as it is already in managing 
their fheep-ftocks, and in acquiring more independance on 
their landlords, than was formerly ufual. The tenants all now 
get tacks, maintain better the bargains they make with the 
proprietor, and know better the way to courts, independent 
of him. 

SJxep- Farming. — Thefe Southland fhepherds have, within 
thefe 40 or 50 years, altered almoft entirely the (lock of the. 
mountains, from black cattle and horfes, to fheep, by which 
they have raifed the rents, over all this country, confidera- 
bly, as well as enriched themfelves. There is one of them from 
Teviotdale, now an heritor in this parith, and in the neigh- 
bourhood, to the amount of, perhaps, L. 300 a year, who 
from a ftock, it is faid, of only L. 50, has acquired, within 50 
vears, by (beep-farming, property to that amount -, and has the 
ftock of two or three fmall farms, (perhaps 1000 fheep,) into 

the bargain. To thefe (bepherds our open weather fecms, 

on the whole, more agreeable than hard feafons, efpecially oi' 
fnow, of which we have had but little, and, in general, of 
fhort continuance, for many years paft. 

Agriculture. — The number of farmers, by the introduction 
of Iheep and other caufes has certainly deci^afed. Many of the 
tackfmen, however, (till continue to retain fome fubtenants 
■who, having a cow's grafs, fome ground toraife potatoes, and 
a little grain, for the fake of the ftraw, as fodder during the 
winter, with the opportunity of fifhing, &amp;c. find themfelves 
eafier and better off, than when they occupied a larger poffef- 
fion; and even thofe who have been obliged to emigrate, have 
in general, fettled at Greenock, where they feem bet- 
ter 



39 2 Statijlical Account 

ter fed and clothed, than when they refided here 

The number of ploughs in the whole pariih, may be about 85 J 
and at the rate of 12 bolls to each plough, there may be about 
1 ceo bolls fown between bear and oats, which may give at 
leaft 4000 bolls increafe. There may be 150, or from that to 
200 bolls of potatoes fown or planted, which may give from 
1 5 to 20 bolls of produce each. They are more cultivated 
within thefe 20 years, and more in the drill way than in for- 
mer days, and add much to the food of the common people. 
They make, with faked herrings, a cheap and not an unplea- 
fant meal for winter.— —Notwithftanding our bad weather, 
the crops are not much to be complained of; perhaps our foil 
and culture rather agreeing with rain than drought. And 
from the herrings that are taken in our bays, the addition to 
our food from the more frequent culture of potatoes, the op- 
portunities the people have of making money, by the bufs-filh- 
ing, and the coafting trade of Clyde, with the good fale and 
price of cattle, the people, upon the whole, feem more at 
eafe, and lefs difpofed to complain, than 40 or 50 years ago, 
though rents are rifing continually, with the continued increafe 
of the nominal value or price of all kinds of provifions. 

The crops of 1782 and 1 783 were, with us, cut down much 
greener than ufual ; but in thre thing, and even in milling, there 
did not feem fo much caufe for complaint, as was feared ; nay, it 
feemed to yield generally above their expectations, and to give 
them an opinion, that, before that time, they allowed tbeir 
crops to ripen too much.

From comparing the number of our births, with our deaths 
and marriages, it is evident, that many born in the parifh re- 
move from it, both before and after marriage, and never re- 
turn. Many, in particular, go into the naval and military 
fervice of their country, efpecially into the navy ; into which, 
it is faid, 90 young men went from one diftrict of the paring 
during the American war. 

Nothing elfe Occurs, that feems to merit attention ; though 
a more accurate obferver might probably difcover many other 
fa£ta, worthy of being communicated to the public, and might 
be able to draw many inferences from them, equally curious 
in themfelves, and interefting to the country.

of great benefit to the farmers. Lime, alfo, is made ufe of 
as a manure. 

Population. The population, in 1755, as returned to

fent, is nearly the fame, being rather above 900. The ave-

Statute, but their attendance is defired, as they pay one half 
of any fum that is impofed, and are beft acquainted with the 
State of the poor, in their own neighbourhood. The bufi- 
neSs is transacted without expence, excepting the fees of the 
clerk, and of the collector. The number of penfioners is be- 
tween 30 and 40. The price of a Hone of meal per we; k, is

more effectually enfure a fubfiftence, and prevent an improper 
ufe of the public bounty. Some faving may be made, alfo, 
by purchafing the meal when it is cheap. School-wages for 
the children of the poor, medical aid, and incidental cxpen-

be ah important object of inquiry, to afcertain, how far the levy-

<p>Name. 

BETWEEN Lindore's loch, in the parifh of Abdie, and the 
village of Monimail, where the church ftands, and 
from which the parifli is named, there is a hill, or rifing 
ground, over which lies the road between Perth and Cupar. 
The length of this hill is fuppofed to have given rife to the 
name, Monimail, ** At the foot of a hill one mile over." It 
is often written and pronounced, Money Meal, and ftrangers 
fuppofe, that it denotes, a " parifh of plenty," abounding 
in meal and money: but the number of Gaelic names in the 
neighbourhood, difcountenances this etymology. 

Form, Extent, and Situation. Thei z is a large map of 

Fife, by Ainflie. The boundaries of the parifh of Monimail 
are not perfectly marked in it, though nearly exa£t. Its fi- 
gure is fomewhat oval, about four feet by three Excep- 
ting on the north and eaft, the lands are flat and fertile. A 
marfh, of about 30 acres, (Lethem mire,) and the heights on 
the north and eaft. are capable of little culture.— It is re-

markable, that, in this neighbourhood, both to the north and 
fouth of the Eden, the foil, in rifing from the plain, becomes 
richer ; but is thin and fandy in the low grounds. — The hills 
are rather green than heathy. The Mount-hill is of confide- 
rable height, and has been planted for feveral years. Veffels, 
on making the land from the eaft feas, are affifted and direct- 
ed by this mount, and by Monzie church, which {lands 

on the top of an eminence beneath it, as a land mark. 

The fituation of the parifh, in general, is dry and falubrious. 
No peculiar epidemical diftempers are known. The inhabi- 
tants are healthy, and there are feveral in fiances of confide- 
- rable longevity. — About half a mile north of the church, 
there is a fpring, known by the name of Cardan's Well : It 
is of no repute at prefent, but was highly efteemed by the fa- 
mous Cardan, who ufed it much ; and, in particular, he is 
faid, with this mineral water, to have cured Hamilton, Arch- 
bifhop of St. Andrews, of a dropfy. — The parifh is well wa- 
tered ; but its different brooks, or waters, as they are called, 
are none of them confiderable. 

Thunder-Storms. On the 27th October, 1733, MeJvilf- 

houfe was ftruck with a remarkable thunder ftorm. The 
whole houfe, on every fide, and from top to bottom, was af- 
fected. The fiream of lightning, it is fuppofed, was attrac- 
ted by a long iron fpike, on the top of a cupola covered with 
lead. The effects of it were felt, and are ftill vifible in almoft 
every part of the houfe : providentially no perfon was mate-

crack or flaw whatever appears in any other place. Many 
fplinters were torn out of the folic! wainfcoting, particularly a 
thin one, about the breadth of a half foot joiner's rule, was 
beaten 14 feet fro;n the top of the fmiflung, on the floor, 
where it made a deep impreflion, which ftill remains. One 
of the chimney tops was thrown down, and fome of the ftones 

carried 100 yards into the garden In July 1783, about 

fix o'clock in the morning, a girl and boy were killed with 
lightning. Peals of thunder, with vivid lightning, were that 
morning loud and frequenc. The mother was a helplefs pal- 
fied woman, and had been carried from her bed to the fire- 
fide. The boy, who was much frightened with the thunder, 
was Handing btfore the fire. The girl was feated oppofite to 
her mother, feeding the fire with brufh wood. On the def- 
cent of the lightning, the boy fell back, and was, for fome 
time, believed to be the only perfon affected : the girl retained 
her fitting pofture, and was not fuppofed to be injured. A 
dog lay motionlefs more than an hour, but on being thrown 
out as dead, revived and recovered entirely. The poor mo- 
ther faid,»me thought the fire, that came down from the hea- 
vens, completely involved her with the reft. The fhock had 
no effect on her health, or conftitution, either favourable or 
unfavourable. What the minifler, who was fent for on the 
awful occafion, faw of the bodies of the children, was firm 
and well coloured, as in life. 

Population. — Dr Wtbfter Hates the number of inhabitants 
to be 884. The regifters have been carefully examined, in 
order to afcertain the population, at different periods, but ir 
is found, that they cannot be relied on. The inaccuracy of 
the records may be vaiioully accounted for, in this, as well as 
in other parifnes. Vacancies, the negligence of parents, 
the careleisnefs of feflion clerks, the illegal with-holding of

Of the different ranks in life, there are 2 noblemen, (of one 
of whom, the Earl of Leven and Melvill, it is remarkable, 
that the fucceffion canbe traced, in direct defcent, from father 
to fon, for 1 8 generations ; the other, Lord Ruthven, is a 
minor); 8 heritors, refident and non-refident ; 1 minifter, 1 
preacher, 1 ftudent of theology, 1 public and 1 private teach- 
er, 1 fchool-miftrefs ; 30 farmers, 35 weavers, 7 fhoemak- 
ers, 8 taylors, 1 1 carpenters, 3 brewers, 1 baker, 3 ma- 
fons, 4 fhepherds, and 5 fmiths. 

With regard to religious opinions, there are 55 diffenters-; 
27 of whom, are Antiburgher Seceders, 2 Independants, and 
the other 26 are Epifcopals, Burgher Seceders, and members 
of the prefbytery of Relief. 

Of married couples there are 172, bachelors 38, and wi-

fes of their own, 31. 

There are three corn mills, and one lint-mill, driven by 
water. Two threfhing-miUs j one driven by horfes, one by 
water. . 5 fmall retail fliops. There is no occaGon for any 
lawyer, attorney, phyfician, or furgeon, in this parifh, as 
the town of Cupar fupplies its environs, with legal and medical 
aid. 

Agriculture. — The mode of managing lands is the fame that 
obtains in the low country in general : confuting of rotations 
of crops, hay, turnips, inclofing, and draining. The face of the 
parifh is confidtrably changed of late, and improvements areliili 
going forward. The productions are the fame with thofe of the 
rclt of Fife and the Lothians. Confiderable quantities of wheat 
and barley are annually exported, or otherwile feat away. The 
railing of black cattle is now more attended to, than formerly. 
Of 8 fmall flocks of iheep, 3 have been very lately fold Off, 
chiefly becaufe fheep injure hedges and fown grafs, and be- 
eaufe it is faid, that more profit is reaped from black cattle. 
There are 5 farms above L. 100 fterling, (one of them L. 300:) 
the reft from L. 70 downwards. One pretty extenfive farm 
rents at L. 1 : 10s per acre. The average rent of good farms is 
below L. 1 per acre. Land of inferior quality is proportional- 
ly lower, 15s. 1 os. &amp;c. &amp;c. Any eftatcs, which have been 
lately fold in this parifh, and indeed ia the neighbourhood, 

have brought high prices. Farm houfes are now built more 

commodious and comfortable. The tenantry improve in their 
manners, drefs, way of life, and form a refpectable body of 
men The ploughs are 76 in number, made on diffe- 
rent models : and new improvements are attended to, and tri- 
ed, as they are fuggeftcd.

The fuppreflion of vails operated confiderably to increafe 

the wages of family fervants. This lift, which applies to 

Fife in general, is a ftrong argument for the augmentation 
of minifters ftipends, fchoolmafters, and the fabrics of all fti- 
pendaries. 

Names of Places. The mod, of perhaps all, the old 

names are Gaelic ; ^Balintagart, the prieft's town ; Letham^ 
the fide of the hill ; Fairnie, a moift place where alders grow ; 
Cunoquhie, head of a corn field, &amp;c. Some are modern. 
The Bow of Fife is the name of a few houfes on the road to 
Cupar. Whether this uncommon name is taken from a tend- 
ing of the road, as fome fuppofe, or, as others, from the 
meetings of the farmers in old times, to fix the prices of 
grain, (the bolls being pronounced bows,) cannot be deter- 
mined. It has been thought, that this fpot is nearly the cen- 
tre of Fife : this is alfo offered as the reafon of the name.—. 
Letham is the principal village. On the firft week of June, 
there is a considerable fair held at it. Eafter Fairnie is next 
in fize : Monimail is fmaller. Other clufters of houfes fcarce- 
ly deferve the name of villages. 

Antiquities. Near the church, and within Melvill park, 

there is a fquare tower in pretty good prefervation. Its age 
is uncertain •, but it was repaired by Cardinal Bethune, and 
was his refidence, 1562. There arc feveral diftincT: heads of 
the Cardinal, in his cap, in ftone relievo on the walls. The 
arms of the family of Bethune are alfo intire. The tower is

evidently part of a large building, the remains of which arc 
very vifible. — The houfe of Fairnie is believed to be one of 
M'DufPscaft'les. Its walls are uncommonly thick : it is very 

old, and has been a place of ftrength. A ftrip of land 

in the farm of Ladifron, belonging to Mr Paterfon of Cuno- 
quhie, is called the temple. There is a tradition, that a 
pried lived here, who had a right to every feventh acre of La- 
difron, and to the tathing (dung as left on the ground) every 
feventh night. 

Tradition fays, there was a dreadful battle, fought on the 
N. W. boundary of the parifh, between the Scots and the 
Danes. A hillock, called Doulie-cairy Knoll, is faid to have. 

received its name from the battle, {firroiv and care).

Longevity. — A woman (Helen Gray) died in this pariih, 
in the 105 year of her age. She was born in Tealand, near 
Dundee. The pariih regifter was confulted, but in vain. 
The death of Archbifhop Sharp, '{he diftinctly remembered : 
If flie was 3 years old then, {he was 105 at her death. She 
was a little woman, remarkably chearful. Some years before 
her death, {lie had a new fet of teeth. In early life fhe had 
been a fervant in Lord Stormont's family. The ladies of the 
neighbourhood were much amufed with her telling them, that 
Mrs Helen Murray, whom they well knew, as lady direclrefb" 
of the Edinburgh aflemblies, was one of the young bairns flie 
remembered and that Mr; Willie", (Earl Mansfield,) when 
young, was a very fine laddie — (boy). 

Suicide. — There has been but one inftance of filicide for h%- 
ny years. The perfon' was old, and hi a confined, vhrpified 
{rate. This event was rendered remarkable by the manner of 
interment. Trie body was brought from the houfe, through the 

window,

window, and burled, under night, at the extremity of the 
parifh. A proof at once of the force of old fuperftitious cuf- 
toms, and, at the fame time, of the horror fo natural to be felt 
on fuch an occafion. 

Poor. — The funds, for the fupport of the poor, arife from 
legacies, mort-cloths, marriages, occafional donations, but 
chiefly from the weekly collections at the church doors. There 
are 10 or 12 regular monthly penfioners. On emergencies, 
others are afftfted. No begging is allowed. The diftribu- 
tions, comtnunibus armis, are betwixt L. 20 and L. 30 fter- 
ling. — In 1782, and 1783, the ordinary funds, with a volun- 
tary and unfolicited donation from the heritors, according to 
their valued rents, fupplied the great exigencies of the poor, 
during thefe two unfortunate feafons. 

Schools. — The eftablifhed fchool-maftei's falary, and perqui- 
fites, as precentor and fcmon-clerk, with the fchool-fees, have 
been reckoned to be worth aboutL. 14. Thenumber offcholars 
varies, according to the abilities and reputation of the teacher; 
and thofe of the private teachers in the parith. 30 may be the av- 
erage. The fees are, Englifh is per quarter ; writing 2s ; arith- 
metic 2S ; book-keeping 10s 6d a courfe ; Latin 2s 6d per quar- 
ter. It is not doubted but this, and fimilar reports,, will evince 
the necefTity of more encouragement to this uftful and labo- 
rious order of men.

f ARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5193171">CULTS</name>. 
(county of fife.) 
By the Rev. Mr. David Wilkie.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, and Extent. 
r TPHE antient name of theparifh was Qulkques or Quilkques . 

which, in the Gaelic, fignifies, a " nook" or " corner."— it 
being disjoined from the large ftrath, which runs fromE. to W. 
-.ilong the banks of the Eden. It is fituated in the prefbytery 
of Cupar, and in the fynod and county of Fife : being about 
: \ Englifh fniles from E. to W. and about 2^ from N. to S. 
it confequently contains about 3.5 fquare miles, and is nearly 
in the form of an oblong fquare. It lies in the very heart of. 
Fife, and has eafy accefs to both the coafts of that county. 

Surface, Soil, and Air.-~ The general appearance is, parti y 
flat, declining to the north -/buf partly mountainous towards the 
fouth. The parifh is remarkable, for a clear air and a light 
foil. The different kinds of foil are, gravel, a light black earth, 
and a ftrong clay ; with this particular circumftance, that, in 
the lower parts, along the Eden, it is gravel inclining to heath, 
and bent grafs ; from thence to the afcent of the hills, it is 
Iiglit earthj and upon their declivity, it is ftrong clay. Upon 

the

the whole, th« air is dry and healthy, except that the lower 1 
ground is fubjecl: to fogs. The moft prevalent diftempers, 
not to mention thofe peculiar to children, are fevers and con- 
fumptions ; but this cannot be attributed to the local fitua- 
tion. The greateft ftorras of rain and fnow are from the E, 
acrofs the German ocean ; the higheft winds from the S. W. 

River. — -The Eden rifes about 8 miles to the W. and falls 
into the bay of St Andrews, about 7 miles to the E. Being fed 
by a number of rivulets, and having a pretty level courfe, it 
is never very low, even in the drieft fummer. It is not na- 
vigable at prefent, to any diftance from its mouth, owing to 
the many mill-dykes, by which it is crofled. Were it thought 
necefTary, for promoting the commerce of the county, it might 
be made navigable, though at a confiderable expence, for 12 
or 14 miles; through which it has a fall probably of about 4c 
feet. Next to the want of commerce,; to defray the expence, 
the greateft tlifadvantage would be, the danger of entering its 
moiuh, on account of lhoals and quickfands. Its banks be- 
ingfomewhat high onboth fides, in its courfe througlVthisparifli, 
i In. re is little danger from land floods. The greateft rife of 
the river for thefe 50 years paft, was in May 1782. From the 
excefe of rain, our crops then failed fo much, that had the 
culture of potatoes been unknown, and the importation of 
grain as little prattifed, as in the end of the laft century, there 
would have been as great a famine, as in the former period. 

• The Eden produces trout, pike, and a few falmon \ 

which laft are fo much diminifhed, by the number of feals, 
which frequent its mouth, that few are caught for fale. 

lldls. — On the fouth-fide of the parifh, are the Walton and 
Pitlelhe hills ; not confiderable for their height ; and connect- 
ed v. ith each othc-r bv rifing grounds. Thev ?,re covered moft-

iy with grafs ; in part, with whins, and in part with heath. 
Hie Walton hill has many fojjle and ramparts cut along its fule, 
which are fuppofed to be the remains of a Roman camp, 
when Agricola invaded Scotland, and encamped one part of 
his army here, and the other at Newtyle in Angus. Many urn3 
have been dug up, full of bones, on and near this hill. 

Minerals. — There is abundance of free-flone and lime-ftone 
quarries; both excellent; particularly the latter, for the lime 
fhtlls of which, there is great demand, both in Fife and in 
Angus. The ftrata are from 2 to 10 feet below the furface, 
and are wrought, without having much recourfe to the ailift- 
ance of gun-powder. There were coal mines fometirne ago 
upon the eftate of Bonzion ; which were employed chief- 
ly for burning lime. They miglit (till be wrought to advan- 
tage. 

Animals. — Horfes and black cattle have been much improv- 
ed, in the courfe of thefe 20 or 30 years, owing to inclofing 
ground, and fowing grafs-feeiis. Horfes chiefly are employ- 
ed, in agriculture, and fell from L. 1 2 to L 15 fterling. Oxen 
fell from L. 7 to L. 12. The rearing of thefe, has diminifh- 
ed the breed of fheep fo much, that in place of 4 or 5 flocks, 
there is now only one. 

Population. — The number of the people has increafed 
within thefe 40 years ; owing chiefly to the great number of 
fmall feus, which have been granted during that period. If the 
feilion record for baptifms may be depended on, the

raifing corn and roots ; 20 in flax; 160 fown with grafs feeds 
for hay or pafture ; 800, including hill and muir, in pafture ; 
and 400 in fir plantations. Rent per acre may be from 5s. to 
L. 2 fterling. The rent of a farm of 200 acres, hill and dale^ 
may be about L. 130. The fize of farms in general, is 100, 

200, or 300 acres. Their number has rather diminifhed 

There are a number of inclofures upon particular farms. In 
the parilh are about 22 ploughs, moftly two-horfe ploughs. —

Stati/lical Account 



Mr Wilkie (the writer of the preceding obfervations) is the 
perfon alluded to, in the Statiftrcal Account of ScotIand  vol. I. 
(Parifli of Kettle), page 377 : In juftice to whom, it is proper 
to mention, that there was a very material error of the prefs. 
Inftead of " This table, upon trial, is found to anfwer betttr 
for Scotland than any yet publifhed by Mr Wilkie," it ought 
to have been printed thus : " This table, upon trial, is found 
by Mr Wilkie, to anfwer better for Scotland, than any yet 
publifhed." The faft is, Mr Wilkie himfelf conftruaed that 

very important table. It may be proper to add, that in 

a letter from Mr Wilkie on the fubjea of annuities, he 
communicates the following particulars, which feem to be 

highly worthy of being laid before the public *f I have 

had an opportunity (fays he) of forming a table of the proba- 
bilities of life, for the county of Fife, from the bills of morta- 
lity in the neighbouring parifli of Kettle ; in which the feve- 

ral ages of the deceafed, have been accurately recorded 

This table, I find, differs materially from all the Englifti tables, 
upon the fame fubjea. For example,

widow's expectation of life; which laft, multiplied by 
19.3, the number of widows left yearly, produces 375.2 = 
maximum of annuitants upon the widows fcheme." 

" Farther, from 36 parifh account 1 ;, publifhed in the firft 
volume of the Statiftical Account of Scotland, it appears, there 
are 46,625 fouls in thefe pariflies: the mean number of births 
and deaths is 1156. Hence *4rrs = 4 0 3j the expectation of 
an infant's life in thefe 36 parifhes; which agrees almoft ex- 
actly with the fame expectation by my table. Many of thefe 
parifhes are in different counties, and fiuuted widely remote 
from each other." 

Mr Wilkie propofes foon to publifh a book c On the Theo- 
M ory of Intereft fimple and compound, derived from firft 
" principles, and applied to annuities : With an illuftration 
'* of the Widows Scheme in the Church of Scotland :" — A 
work, which will probably throw much light upon thefe im- 
portant fubjects of inquiry. In the mean while, the following ta-

The moft valuable age by this table, is that of 2 years old, 
whofe expectations of life, is 56^ years, which is exceedingly 
high, and can only be applied to a country diftr'nSl in Scot- 
land. 

The above table of the probabilities of life is a ftriking evi- 
dence, that Englifh or foreign tables of obfervations do not 
correfpondwithScottifh lives;— feeing bythefe, the expectation 
of infancy does not exceed 25, or at moft 28 years, whereas 
here, it wants but a trifle of 50. And if the value of life, 
were computed by the above table* at a given rate of intereft, 
the difference would al fo be confiderable, which would flill 
increafe, did the practice of inoculation every where prevail. 
Hence, a table of equal decrements, conftructed upon the fup- 
pofition, that 9 1 was the utmoft extent of human life, would 
be better adapted to Scottifh lives, than M. de Moivre's hypo- 
thefis, wherein that extent is fixed at 86 years. 

It may be here obferved, that if we had tables of obferra- 
tion, adapted to the feveral counties in Scotland, it would be 
eafy to find the number of inhabitants, from the amount of 
births and burials. Thus, where they are equal, either ai 
them multiplied by an infant's expectation, call it, for in- 
ftance, 40, will produce the population. But where there is 
a difference, which is generally the cafe, the half of their 
fum, multiplied by an infant's expectation, adapted to the 
particular dillrict, will give the number of the people. It would 
be very defirable therefore, to have extracts from the regifters of 
all the pariihes in Scotland, where exact accounts are kept of 
the ages of the deceafed, for the purpofe of drawing up com- 
plete tables of the probabilities of lives, calculated for Scotland.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3683008">COLLESSI K</name> 

(county of fife.) 

By the Rev. Mft. Andrew Walker.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 
T)OTH the antient, and the modern name of this parifli, as 
far as it can now be afcertained, is Colleffie, derived, 
it is fuppofed, from the Gaelic : in which language, Col is 
faid to fignify the bottom, and lejfie, a den ; and the village, in- 
deed, is fituated at the bottom of a den. It lies in the 

prefbytery of Cupar, and in the iynod and county of Fife. 
Its length is about 8 Englifh miles, and its breadth about 5. 
— The fouth fide of the parifh is remarkably flat ; and there 
is fcarcely a {lone, great or fmall, to be feen in it. The 
north-weft fide is fomewhat hilly. The arable part is ex- 
tremely fertile. The air is in general healthy. The mo it 
prevailing diftemper, 50 or 60 years ago, was the ague. It 
now vifits us but feldom, fince the late improvements by 
draining, &amp;c. 

River, Loch, Istc— The Eden runs about 3, miles along the 
fouth fide of the parifli, from weft to eaft. Thence it pro- 
ceeds to Cupar, and empties itftlf into the German ocean,

near St Andrews. It abounds .with fine trout. In feed-time 
and harveft, it ufed to overflow its banks, and to do confide- 
rable damage. But, about 5 years ago, its courfe was made 
ftraight ; in confequence of which, it flows witkout interrup- 
tion, and the adjacent grounds have become quite fecure. A 
large loch, on the fouth-wefl fide of the parifh was drained, 
anno 174?. It contains upwards of 300 acres, which produ- 
ces a confiderable quantity of natural hay, and paftures, du- 
ring the fummer feafon, above 120 head of cattle. In winter, 
however, it has ft ill the appearance of a loch, and is frequent- 
ed by a great variety of wild fowl, fwans, &amp;c. 

Population. — The number of fouls, as reported to Dr Web- 
fter, in 1755, was 989. After a very exact furvey this year, 
(1791) they were found to amount to 949. The decreafe is 
owing to the junction of farms, and to the number of cot 
houfes which have been fuffered to fall into decay. In the 
principal village, called Kinloch, there are 191 fouls. For 
thefe laft ten years, ending 1790, the average of marriages is 
6, of births, 17, and of burials, nf. The regifter, howe- 
ver, is not perfectly exact; clandeftinc marriages often taking 
place, and many of the Seceders give no information, to the 
fefiion clerk, of the births of their children. 

Longevity. — In the village of Colleflie, there is a very old 
man, (Thomas Gamck) who, from the bell information that 
can be got, is in the 108th year of his age. He has rellded 
many years in this parHh, but was born in Perth (hire. He 
was a foldier, in the Duke of Argyle's regiment, in the year 
1715. For nearly 20 years pad, he has never been known 
confined to his bed by ficknefs, for a fingle day. He is of a 
fhort Mature, thin make, wears his own hair, and has been 
for fome years pad much afflicted with deafneis. But, on the 
• Vol. II. 3 G whole,

whole, he is ftill very healthy, and, in a fummer day, will 
walk two miles from his own home, and back again. About 
9 years ago he married his third wife, a woman of 45 but he 
ftill keeps the whole houfe under proper fubjection. He is 
principally fupported out of the public funds. Other inftan- 
ces of longevity are not wanting in this diftri£t. There are a 
few above 80, and 1 or 2 upwards of 90 years of age. 

Ecclefuijlkal Slate. — The living, when grain fells well, may- 
be valued at L. 100 per annum, including the glebe. Mr 
Johnfton of Lathrilk is patron, and one of the principal heri- 
tors. There are many diflenrers, of every denomination in 
the parifli ; but by far the greateft number adhere to the efta- 
bli&amp;cd church. 

AMiquilles. — Not far from the village of Colleffie, to the 
weft, there are the remains of two caftles, or fortifications. The 
one is fituated in a wet, and marfhy fpot. Upon the weft 
fide of it, there is an earthen mound, of a circular form, about 
an Englifh mile in length, and about 30 feet high, above the 
level of the ground in the neighbourhood. Some fay, that it 
was a place of obferration ; and there is indeed a tery good 
view from it. Others imagine, that the mound was conftruft- 
ed by an enemy for the purpofe of damming up the ftream 
that comes from Colleffie den, in order to force the caftle to 
furrender. This ftream runs, at prefent, through the mid- 
dle of the mound, 2t a place called Gadding j fo named, from 
the water burfting through it. About 8 years ago, an urn 
was found, near the mound, containing fome human bones, 

all of which feemed to have been burnt. The other for- 

tiGcation is called the Maiden Caftle. The tradition concern- 
ing it, is, that during the time of the fiege, the governor died, 
and his daughter, concealing his death, gave the neceflary or- 
2 ders 



of ColleJJie. 4^ 

ders in his name, and thus made the caftle hold out, until the 
enemy raifed the fiege. In the middle of this ruin, there 

are two ftones fixed in the ground, (covering, it is fuppofed, 
human bones,) but of no very remarkable fize. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations . The number of the greater he- 
ritors, is 12 ; of whom 6 refide in the parifh. There are alfo 

a number of feuers, or fmaller proprietors. There are 

no turnpikes; but the roads and bridges, in general, are in good 
repair. The rent of the belt arable land is, at an average, be- 
tween 30 and 40*. the acre ; the next beft about 203. The 

number of ploughs may be about 60. There are only 3 

flocks of fheep, the Iargeft of which belongs to Lord Leven. 

A considerable part of the parifh is inclofed, and 

inclofures are going forward. The common fuel is coals, 

brought about 6 miles from Balbirnie, or Balgonie . 

The fchoolmafter's falary is about L. 8 Sterling, with a dwell- 
ing houfe, fchool houfe, and a fmall garden ; and the dues 
paid him by his fcholars, who, at an average, are about 40 in 
number. The poor who get fupplies, either ftatedly or occa- 
fionally, are about 10. The only funds, for their relief, are, 
the collections at the church doors, amounting, at an average, 
to L. 11. or L. 12 yearly, and a mortification from the Roffie 

family of a boll of meal per annum. Upon theprofpefl 

of a war, many of our young men have (hewn themftlves 
ready to ferve their country, both by fei and land. None have 
been under the neceffity of emigrating from this parifh, for 
want cf employment, and none have died of want.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3778259">DENNY</name>. 

(COUNTY OF STIRLING.) 

B the Rev. Mr. Thomas Fergus.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

■HT^HE origin of the name of Denny is unknown. The 

parifh lies in the county and prefbytery of Stirling, 
and fynod of Perth and Stirling. — It is about 4 miles in length, 
and Zf in breadth. — The foil, about the town, or village of 
Denny, and indeed throughout the greater part of the parilh, 
is dry and fandy ; but in fome places, it is wet, and has a good 
deal of clay in it.— The air is reckoned pure and healthy, and 
many of the people attain a good old age. Some, however 
are much troubled with rheumatic complaints  and fevers fre- 
quently prevail, and are often fatal. 

Proprietors, Agriculture, &amp;c A fourth part of the pa- 
rilh belongs to one great proprietor, and another has a consi- 
derable fhare of it. The reft is the property of about 1.00 
fmaller heritors, feuers, or portioners 5 many of whom culti- 
vate their own lands. Of late years, the farmers make ufe 

of a good deal of lime, which they chiefly bring from the pa- 
rilh of Cumbernauld, and fome from the parith of Dunipace. 

-Oats

— Outs are the grain ufually fown, wich feme bear and peafe, 
but no wheat. A good many potatoes, a quantity of flax, and 
fome clover and rye-grafs, are alio raiftd. 

Population. The population of the parifh of Denny, 

in 1755, as returned to Dr Wtbfttr, was 1392 fouls. The 
number is now reckoned about 1400. There are, at an ave- 
rage, 60 births, 20 burials, and more than 1 2 marriages each 
year. 

Churchy t*fV. — The Crown is patron — The ftipend is 80 

bolls in meal, and L. 38 fterling, in money. The church, 
manfe, and offices, are not in good repair. — After the Secef- 
fion began, more than one half of the inhabitants, at that 
time, became Seceders of the Antiburgher perfuafion ; and 
they have had, for upwards of 40 years, a meeting- houfe, at 
Loan-head, about 2. miles fouth from Denny. More than a 
third part of the people are Hill Seceders, of one denomina- 
tion or another. A few are Cameroriians. There arc no 
Papifts nor Epifcopalians. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There are no begging poor, be- 
longing to the parifh, but there are a number of houfe-keepers 
in indigent circumftances, who receive occafional fupplies 
from the collections, made at the church-doors, on Sunday. — 
The men are almoft all engaged in huibandry, and the women 

generally in fpinning.— -A number of boys and girls 

are employed at a print-field, and cotton manufactory, in the 
neighbouring parifh of Dumpace. A large tra£t of land here, 
is called Temple-Denny, which formerly belonged, it is faid, 
to the Knights Templars, fo famous for their crufades againffc

to fupply the inhabitants, but alfo a good part of the neigh-

that of Dunipace, furnifhes us with fome trout.— The great 
canal, between the Forth and the Clyde, which runs along 
the fouthern part of the parifli, is alfo, in many refpe&amp;s, of 
great benefit to the people.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1011521">BURNTISLAND</name>. 
(county of fife.) 
By the Rev. Mr. James Wemyss.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

IT is difficult to afcertain the origin of the name. The tra- 
ditional ftory is, that it arofe from the burning of a few 
fifliermen's huts, upon a fmall illand on the weft fide of the 
harbour, which induced them to take up their refidence, where 
the town now ftands. Originally, however, the parilh was 
defigned Kinghorn-wefter. It is fituated in the county of 
Fife, on the firth of Forth, north and by weft, from Leith, a- 
bout 6 miles It is in the prefbytery of Kirkaldy, the fynod and 
county of Fife. From eaft to weft it may extend about 3 miles, 
and nearly as far from fouth to north. 

Tenon and Climate. — The town of Burnttfand is pleafantly 
fituated, upon a peninfula, fur'rounded by hills to the north, 
in the form of an amphitheatre. They lie at the diftance of a- 
bouthalf a mile, and happily occafion much warmth andlhel- 
ter. The climate is very healthful. The air, dry and clear, 
rather (harp. Many of the inhabitants live to a good old age. 
They enjoy the benefit of fine dry walks of great extent, and

can go abroad at all feafons, when it is fair. To thofe who 
are fond of the healthful and manly diverfion of the golf, there 
is adjoining, one of the fined pieces of links, of its fize, in 
Scotland. A great part of it is like velvet, with all the variety 
of hazards, neceffary to employ the different clubs, ufed by 
the niceft players. A golfing club was inftituted lately, by 
the gentlemen of the town and neighbourhood. 

Bruntifland was conftituted a royal burgh, by King James 
VI. The government of it it vefted in 21 perfons, of whom 
14 are termed Guild-counftllors, confiding of merchants 
tradcfmen, fkippers, feamen, and land labourers ; of whom 
3 are chofen yearly at Michaelmas, by the old and new coun- 
cil, to be bailies •, the other 7 are trades-counfellors, being one 
of each trade. There is alfo a provoft chofen yearly at Mi- 
chaelmas. If he is a nobleman, he is a fupernumerary j but 
if a burgher, he is included in the above number. 

It appears, at fome former period to have been fortified. 
On the fouth-eaft fide of the harbour, part of the walls of a 
fort is dill Handing entire. And oh the top of a fmall hill, 
immediately to the north of the town, there are to be feen, 
the remains of a trench. It is alfo had, that when Cromwell 
had an army in this country, it held out againft him, till he 
he was obliged to enter into a compromife, with the inhabi- 
tants, on certain conditions:, part of which were, that he 
fhould repair the ftreets and the harbour. In confequence of 
this, the quays, as they prefently ftand, were built by him, 
•and the flreets have never been mended frnce, which thtir 
orcfent ftate too clearly proves. There is, however, every rea- 
fon to hope, that they will foon be put into better condition, as 
the gentlemen of the county have lately propofed, to make the 
public ferry from Burnthland to Leith, or rather to Newha- 
v;n, where it is intended, to build a pier, in order to fecuro 
a p.-.iTige for travellers, at any time of tide.

Trade- — Before the union, the trade of this place feems to 
have been very confiderable. A number of flaps belonged to 
!t. Large quantities of malt were made, and exported to 
England, and the north, which yielded great profits. Many 
of the fliipmaflersj and inhabitants appear to have been weal- 
thy. But fince that period, little bufmefs of any kind has been 
done, till within thefe few years, when trade has again begun 
to revive a little. Some branches of manufactures have been 
eftabliflied. There is, at prefent, a fugar hcufe, belonging to 
a Glafgow company, in a very thriving condition; and a vitri- 
ol work, upon a fmall fcale, but, having lately become the 
property of fome gentlemen of much induftry and fpirit, it is 

to be extended, and will moft likely do well. An attempt . 

was alfo recently made, to eltablifh a filk manufactory. This, 
however, did not anfwer the wiflies of the projectors ; which, 
perhaps, was more owing to the want of capital, arid fome o- 
ther caufes, than to the badnefs of the trade, or any thing unfa* 
vourable in the fituation of the place. Ship-building is carri- 
ed on by a few hands, and might be increafed to any extent. — 
It is much to be regretted, that manufactures are not eftablifli- 
ed here. Indeed, it is rather furprifmg they have not, as the 
town is doubtlefs equally, if not more, favourable, for thefe, 
than many others on the coaft of Fife, where they are carried 
on to a great extent. No place can be better fituated for ex- 
port and import •, houfes are low rented ; fuel is reafonable 5 
coals may be had both by fea and land ; 1 3 ftone, heavy weight, 
from is. to is 3d. Many hands could eafily be had, from among 
the young and the poor, particularly for the cotton branch, 
who are, in a great meafure, loft, for want of employment. — 
And though the water in the town is moltly hard, yet there 
are fome wells of it foft ; and, in the neighbourhood, there 
is a confiderable run of foft water, with many copious fprings^ 
along the foot of the hills, by which bleaching might be carri-

ed on. Befides, the manufacturers will now have the benefit 
of good roads, and carriers to all parts of the country. 

The Harbour. — What next merits particular notice, in this 
place, is, the harbour, which certainly is one of the beft in 
Scotland. By way of excellence it is called, in fome of the 
town's charters, Partus Gratis and Portus Salutts. It is here, 
that {hips generally take fhelter, when driven up by ftorms, 
and hard gales of eafterly wind. It is eafily entered, and af- 
fords the greateft fafety, let the wind blow from any quarter. 
It is very capacious, and of great depth of water. The Cham- 
pion frigate came lately in, with all her ftores, and got as con- 
veniently cleaned, as in a dock. Much improvement might 
ftill be made upon it. Were the quays extended, (which could 
eafily be done at no great expence) fmall fhips could come 
in, and go out, at any time of tide. In the opinion of profef- 
fional men, docks ought to be eftablifhed here, capable of re- 
ceiving the largeft fhips of war. This is furely an object, well 
deferving the attention of government. It might be done at a 
fmall expence. And, in the event of our ever being at war, 
with our northern neighbours, would be a vaft faving and con- 
veniency, as the fhips that happened to want cleaning and re- 
pair, would not need" to return to England for that purpofe ; 
which they muft always do at prefent. Even for the fhips that 
are ftationed in this Firth, and fuch as may occafionally come 
into it, an eftablifhment of this kind would be a great faving 
of time and money. Here too, houfes and yards for the 
King's ftores might be had, much more conveniently, and at 
far lefs expence, than at Leith. They could be had at the VGr 
ry entrance of the harbour, or along the quays. And as the 
houfes would be cheap, and the accefs eafy, an annual faving 
of fome hundreds of pounds might reafonably be expected. 
There is another thing, refpe&amp;ingthis harbour, which deferves

to be pointed out to Government, and may at leafl merit their 
confideration. It is this ; that it might be made one of the 
fafeft and mofl convenient watering-places poflible, for his Ma- 
jefty's fhips in this Firth. At no great expence, a run of the 
nnefl water might be introduced, by a pipe, and carried to a- 
ny of the quays, thought mod proper, where the king's boats 
might receive it, without the leatt trouble or danger. This may 
be thought the more worthy of notice, as, it is well known, 
that the prefent mode of watering the King's fhips, either by 
going to Leith, or Harly burn, a place on the north fhore, a- 
bout a mile to the weftward of Burntifland, is often attended 
with danger, and fomttimes with lofs. And, it is to be hoped, 
it would be no fnull inducement to adopt this plan, were it 
to be properly ftated to Government, that the fame pipe, that 
fupplied his Majefty's tfhips, could eafdy furnifh thf town of 
Burntifland, with foft water, of which it {lands much in need. 
It would be juft, or at leafl, it would be generous, to accom- 
modate a place, at prefent unable to help itfelf ; a place, efpe- 
cially, that, upon every occafion, has furnifhed a very large 
proportion of brave men, for the navy; and, where many of 
the lame, and the wounded, and many of the widows and the 
fatherlefs, of thofe who have fufFered in the fervice of their 
country, now refide. 

It is furprifing, that the advantages of this harbour, fhould 
have fo long been overlooked by the public ; and no lefs fo, 
that, in the prefent enterprifing mercantile age, they have not 
been laid hold of, and improven. It is doubtlefs equal, if not 
preferable to any in Scotland, for dry docks. Its vicinity to 
Edinburgh, the capital of the kingdom, and its ready accefs, 
by fea, to every quarter of the globe, certainly renders it eli- 
gible for every fort of mercantile purfuit. 



Shores.— To the weftward of the town, towards Aberdour, 

the

the fhore is all rocky ; and, from a quarter of a mile eaftward, 
it is all fandy, till it joins the Pettycur harbour, near King- 
horn. Oppofile' this fandy beach, the fea has made great in- 
croachments, within thefe hundred years, and ftill continues 
to gain ground. Near the town, however, the rocks are a 
perfect defence. From thefe rocks, there is as much fea 
weed cut, every two years, as produces about 12 0^15 ton of 
kelp. After gales of eafterly and foutherly winds, there fre- 
quently come on fhore, large quantities of tangles and fea 
weeds, which are ufed as mar.ure,'and anfwerwell for a feafon. 

It might be mentioned here, how beneficial the rocks and 
fhores are to the inhabitants of this place, particularly the 
poor, from the large quantities of fhell-fifh, that may be ga- 
thered, of one kind or another, at all feafons; efpecially cockles, 
which abound in the extenfive fands between Bumtifland and 
Kinghorn. A boy or girl may gather to the value, perhaps, of 
3d. or 4d. in a few hours. Excellent oyfters are alfo to be had 
near the town. The bed belongs partly to the borough, and 
partly to the Earl of Morton, 

Hills. — The moft remarkable hill, is that which lies about 
half a mile north of the town. It is very fteep, and elevated 
between 500 and 6oo feet above the level of the fea. It yields 
moft excellent pafture in any feafon ; is well watered and fliel- 
tercd, and withal, very extenfive. It would make one of the 
fined: inclofures in Scotland, particularly for fheep. From its 
appearance, one would almoft be induced to believe, it had 
undergone fome violent commotion, and that the rocks on 
each end were incrufted with fome thing like volcanic mat- 
ter. 

In the fame line, to the eaftward, there is another very high 
hill, called 13 unearn, remarkable for having a fmall loch, or 



of Bumtijland. 429 

lake, upon its top, which never dries in any feafon. On the 
north fide it is very fteep and rugged ;— the appearance 
frightful, from the projection of the (tones, and the immenfe 
number that have tumbled down. The ftones, of which this 
hill is compofed, feem to be of the Bafaltic kind. They are 
moftly of a regular figure, (land upon end, and are generally 
from 2 to 4 feet long : All this makes it probable, that it 
has once been the feat of a volcano, and the loch might be the 

crater. There is alfo, on the very fummit of this hill, a 

flat piece of ground, furrounded with an immenfe number of 
loofe ftones, called Agricola's camp, or garrifon. The ftones 
appear once to have been built, but not with mortar, or ce- 
ment of any kind. It is highly probable this tradition is true: 
— If we may believe Tacitus, it is certain, that the Romans 
explored the north coaft of the Forth with their fhips. It is 
no lefs fo, that fome of the legions were garrifoned during the 
winter, near the coaft. Dunearn hill, from its fituation, 
would moft naturally invite them, to take up their refidence 
on it. Befides, the country from this, all the way to Benartie- 
hill, near the Lommonds, exactly unfwers the defcription 
which that hiftorian gives of it, in his account of the Roman 
expedition on the north of Bodotria, i. e. Forth. It was 
full, he fays, of hills, rocks, marfties, woods, and lakes. 

A little way to the novth-eaft, is the hill of Orrock, 

of confiderable extent, but not fo ftaep as the two former. 
It affords alfo excellent pafture. It is faid diamonds have been 
found on it, and that it produces capil'ary herbs. There is 
alfo a vitriolic fpring upon it. - -Next to Orrock is the 
farm of Babie ; moft of which is hilly and high ground, but 
yields good crops, both of corn and grafs. On thefe hills of 
Oirock and Babie, feveral barrows or tumuli are to be feen, but 
tOQ large to be eafily removed. Some of them have, however, 

been 



Statijlical Account 



been dug up, and difcovered the,'bones of thofe antient war- 
riors over whom, they had been raifed. 

With refpeft to the hills above mentioned, it may be ob- 
ferved, that they are peculiarly adapted Tor fheep ; being 
verdant the greateft part of the year. The proprietors turn 
them to good account, by the rearing and feeding of black cat- 
tle; but doubtlefs, turning them into fheep walks, would render 
them ftill more beneficial to themfelves, and ufeful to the 
country. The Bin moftly belongs to Roger Ayton, Efq. of 
Inch-dairny; Dunearn to Dr Charles Stuart of Edinburgh; 
Orrock to the Earl of Morton ; and Babie to William Fergu- 
ibn, Efq, of Raith. 

Soil. Between the hills and the fea, the foil is moftly 

very rich, and when properly cultivated, produces excellent 
crops. The rent is generally from 4 to 4 $ bolls of barley, 
or from L. 3 to L. 3 : 3 an acre. Wheat, barley, and beans, 
are moft cultivated. The grain is of the beft quality, from 
the warmnefs of the climate, owing to the furrounding hills. 
The grounds, in the higher part of the parifh, are of a much 
inferior value, as may be fuppofed, from the lightnefs of the 
foil, and their more elevated fituation : Notwithstanding 
which, they bring a good rent to the proprietor. Few of the 

tenants have regular tacks, and extenfive farms.- They, in 

general, follow the new mode of farming. — The burdenfome 
and injurious effects, of the feudal, fyftem are totally abolifhed 
among them. 

Ecclcfuifikal Slate of the Parift — The place" of worfhip 

for the parifh, was formerly, about half a mile north of the 
town. The remains of it are ftill to be feen, with the old manfe, 
and burial yard. It evidently appears to have been originally a 
Popifh chapel, but when built, is not known. 

In 



of Burntijland. 431 

In 1592, the parifh growing more numerous, and, it may 
be fuppofed, the inhabitants of the town, more wealthy, they 
buih a new church within the borough, aflcing nothing from 
the heritors but their conftnt. And, at the fame time, as an 
inducement, granted them proper feats, with certain privi- 
leges, taking the whole burden of building and repairing up- 
on themfelves. It is a ftately fquare flructure, with a pavili- 
on roof ; and, with a little more nnifhing, would be a moft 
handforne place of worfhip. That it is capacious, will appear 
from a faft well known in this place, that it once held within 
its walls, between 3000 and 4000 HelTians, that were lying 

encamped near the town, in the year 1746. There is alfo a 

meeting-houfe for the Antiburgher Seceders. 

The king is patron. The llipend confifts of 2 chalders 

of barley, 2 of oats ; L. 60 in money, with a manfe and 
glebe ; and L. 5 for communion elements. An augmentation 
was obtained within thefe 20 years. The free teind is ftill 
very confiderable. 

Population. The number of fouls, in the parifh, may be 

about 1 100. In the report made to Dr Webfter, An. 1755, 
they are called 1390. The inhabitants of the borough are of- 
ten fhifting. No regifter of burials has ever been kept. 

State of the Poor. The poor, within the borough, are ra- 
ther numerous. None of them, however, beg. There being 
no funds, they are fupplied by weekly, and extraordinary col- 
lections at the church-doors. Such of them, as have their names 
put on, what is called, the poors roll, get from 6d. to is a week. 
Their fupport mull: be fmall, confidering from whence it ari- 
fes. Mod of the heritors are non-refidenters, which makes 
the burden fall heavy upon fuch as are any way able, or rather 
well difpofed, to relieve the necefjkies of the poor. Such a

general affeffment fliould certainly take place in this, and hi e- 
very other parifh, as would affect the landlord and his tenant, in 
fome juft proportion, according to their ability, whether in- 
clined to be charitable or not, and whether of the eftablifhed 
church or difTenters : and, till this takes place, there is little 
doubt, but that both the uncharitable and the Seceder, will 
take but fmall fhare in the fupport of the poor. 

Quarries. — There is a very fine quarry of free (tone, a fmall 
diftance north from the town, on the Grange eftate. Moft of 
the new buildings along the coaft, to a confiderable diftance, 
are furnifhcd with hewn work from that quarry. About a mile 
to the eaftward, and alfo to the weftward, there are inexhauf- 
tible quarries of lime {tone, which is fent offin great quanti- 
ties to the works at Carron, and other places. There is alfo 
upon the fhore, near the town, excellent quarries of hard 
ftone, which is ufed for oven foles, and chimney grates ; as 
they endure the greateft heat, and will laft for many years.-- 
There is alfo, on the eftate of Grange, a fort of marble, which 
has been wrought, and takes a very fine polifh. 

Coal. At one period, it is certain, coal has been wrought 

in this parifh ; but how, or on what account it was given up, 
is not now known. Of late, fome attempts have been made, by 
Mr Wemyfs of Cuttlehill and others, to find coal ; but thefe 
have been fo feeble, as by no means to be reckoned a fufficient 
trial. But it is to be hoped, the proprietors will be induced to 
renew their attempts, with more fpirit, and fuccefs. 

Mifcellaneous Qbfervations. There are 2 mills clofe to the 

town, employed in making flour, meal, and barley. One of 
them is erected upon the fea, which comes into a bay, on the 
north fide of the eftate ©f Roffcnd. At an average it works the 

yeaf

year round, about 14 hours each day. On the fame Water, 

other profitable works might be ere&amp;ed.. There is alfo a 

diftilkry in the neighbourhood of the town, in high repute for 
making good whiflcy. But however profitable this, and other 
works of the fame kind, may be, to the manufacturer, the land- 
lord, and the farmer, there can be little doubt of their being 
raoft pernicious to the health, the morals, andtheinduftryof the 

people at large There are, at prefent 3 large flout boats, with 

a fmall one, that goes at half tide. They crofs every day, when 
pafTcngers call up. And when once the quays are extended  
as now refolved on, there will be pafTage at all times, wind 
and weather ferving. ■ It is alfo proper to mention, that 
about 5 years ago, an ingenious foreign gentleman, ha his 
refearches about this country, difcovered in this parifh, a fort 
of mould, (which appears to be rocks reduced by time to 
earth) ; of which he afterwards fent to France two fliip loads. 
He was very tenacious of making any difcoveries refpecting 
its quality — It is now known, however, that the court of 
France prohibited the importation of it. It is thought this ftuflf 
was ufed either in the porcelain manufactory, or for making 
-crucibles. The (hips were loaded from the earth, on the top 
«f a fmall lull, immediately to the north of the town*

tion *. 

To reftore this country, however, to its former date of re- 
fpectability, as well as beauty, it muft be indebted to the pro- 
prietors of the foil, for replacing not only the woods, but the 
inhabitants, which the impolitic practice of adding farm to 
farm, and the fatal operation of poors-rates, have compel- 
led to leave their native home f. It is painful to fee (as 
in this parifh) one perfon rent a property, on which one hun- 
dred inhabitants were reared to the Itate, and found a comfor- 
table fubfiftance. It adds to the bleaknefs of the fcene, to 
fee a few fhepherds (trolling over the face of a country, which 
formerly, was the nurfe of heroes, who were juftly accounted 
the bulwark of theirnative foil, being ever ready tobrave danger 
and death in its defence. Of this we have a memorable proof, 
in the pathetic lamentations of their wives and daughters, for 
the difafcer of the field of Flowden, " where their brave for- 
" refters were a' wed away."

town. The town of Selkirk is pleafantly fituated on % 

rifing ground, and enjoys an extenfive profpect, in all direc- 
tions, efpecially up and down the river Etterick. The foil a- 
round it, is dry, and the harveft early. From its open fitua- 
tion, and aim oft equal ciiftance from both feas, :.t is lefs rai- 
ny than any other part of this country. By a meafure of rain 
kept accurately for ten years, and compared with one kept at 
Hawkhill, in the neighbourhood of Leith, for the fame time, 
Selkirk was found to exceed only one half inch yearly *.— — 
There is no place in this country fo free from epidemical dif- 
eafes'; and were the citizens equally fupplied with the other 
comforts of life, as with wholefome air, no town in Scotland 
would produce a greater number of aged inhabitants. There 
a good many from 70 to 80, 3 at and above 90, and one died 
lately at 106. 

That Selkirk, though diftant from coal, is happily fituateei 
for carrying on the woolen trade, Hawick on the one hand, 
and Gallafhiels on the other, clearly demonftrate. But it is 
a, royal burgh, and as fuch, fuffers in all its beft interests, and 
foqial ir.tcrcourfe. To acquire political power, and not com- 
mercial property, is the great object of the principal citizens.

The burgh lands of Selkirk are worth more than L. 1000 
per artoUnu and are divided into a great number of fmall pro- 
perties. This circumdance, alfo, tends to damp that fpirit for 
manufactures and commerce, by which the inhabitants of towns 
are in general diftinguifhed. Such is the rage of the citizens 
to become lairds, that all their wealth is laid out in purchafing 
acres or half acres, on which many of them, and the wretched 
beads that till them, are half ftarved. As all the burgh lands, 
are, in the occupancy of the proprietors, there is none to be

State of Agriculture, and of Sheep Farming — The lands in 
this parifh are generally hilly, and more adapted to pafture 
than tillage ; but moft of the farms have a large portion of 
low ground, lying towards, and along the fides of the rivers. 
They have not hitherto been managed to that advantage of which 
they are very capable. If you a(k the farmers, why they plough 
the faces of their hills, by which they hurt their fheep walk, 
and derive not from their miferable returna, an equivalent for 
feed and labour ? If you aik them why they cut their ben- 
ty paftures, the bed fupport of their fheep in the wiater 
frofts ? they anfwer, Becaufe they cannot iupporr their black 
cattle in winter without thefe aids, air they can neither raifc 
hay nor turnips. How eafdy might this evil be remedied, and 
the value of their farms encreafed, by drawing a done dyke a- 
long their low grounds, and confining the farmer to a pr»per 

management

management of thefe, as the only arable part of his farm. Fof- 
example, one-fourth oats, one-fourth turnips, potatoes, &amp;c. 
one-fourth barley, and one- fourth hay. This rotation will af- 
ford every farmer in this parifh, abundant fupport for his fami- 
ly, his flocks, and his cattle, however fevere the winter may 
be. From what calamities would not this preferve them ; we 
fhould not then fee them when ftorms arife, driving their 
ftarved flocks to the lefs fnowy hills of Annandale - ; nor pur- 
chafing hay at an extravagant price, and carrying it "through 
almoft impafiable roads to their flocks, when their ftomachs 
are too weak to receive or digeft it. The management of 
flocks begins to be better underftood, and the farmers, by put- 
ting fewer upon the fame ground, have encreafed the fize of 
thdr fheep, leflened the difeafes to which they are liable, and 
improved the quantity and quality of the wool, more than by 
all the other means, hitherto difcovered. 

To two difeafes, of a very ferious nature, the flocks here 
are ftill expofed. The one, a fever, to which the hogs ov 
fheep of the firft year are fo liable in winter, and efpecially 
in variable weather, with intermitting frofts, that the farmer 
reckons himfelf fortunate, if he lofes only three of each fcore 
in his hirfle. This difeafe, (the braxy, as fome call it), has 
been examined, and is found to arife from the withered 
grafs on which the animal then feeds, and the want either of 
liquid, or mufcular motion in the ftomach to dilTolve it. The 
confequence is, that the dry and unconcocled food enters the 
inteilines in an impervious (tate ; the obftru&amp;ions excite an 
inflammation, a fever and mortification, of which the animal 
dies. A remedy, has, with fuccefs, been attempted. Turnips, 
from their purgative nature, have been found capable, not on- 
ly of preventing, but of curing the difeafe.. The tops of

firs, however, from their refinous nature, (if fuch plantations 
are weeding) will be found ftill more effectual*. 

The other difeafe, known only within thefe 50 years, is of 
a much more alarming nature, as it affects not only our whole 
flocks, but the fhepherds and their dogs. It is a fpecies of 
tick, with which our paftures fwarm. They begin to appear 
about the end of March, and retire about the middle of Au- 
gufl. Unlike to the other animals of the blood-fucking tribe, 
which fall ofF when full, thefe feldom let go the hold, till, if 
their number is fufficient, they drain the whole blood in the 
body of their fuffering victim. Numbers of fheep, of all ages, 
but efpecially the young, die of this difeafe. The fheep too, 
that furvive it, peflered with thefe vermin, feed not to the 
condition or value they otherwife would. Eurning the benty 
paftures where they breed in the fpring, is found to lefTen the 
evil ; but no means are yet difcovered by which it can be era- 
dicated. An experiment was tried, laft year, by a farmer ia 
this parifh, who anointed the bare part of the thigh of fix of 
the moft difeafed lambs in his flock with mercurial ointment ;

the fheep with a competition of butter or tar, which, thougfi 
it fpoils the colour, yet is faid to improve the quality, and to 
increafe the quantity of the wool. It faves the flocks alfo, 
from the influence of the winter rains, from fcab and ver- 
min of every kind, except the tick. 

The quantity of tar, ufed in fmearing the fheep, varies ac- 
cording to the height of the fheep walk, and the want of fhel- 
ter. In the low parts of the country, they do not ufe one half 
of the quantity, that is necefiary in the high lands ; which is 
from if to 3 lb. of butter to each Scots pint of tar. 

The farms here are never valued according to the quantity 
of acres, but the quantity of fheep they will maintain; and 
the pafture of thefe, according to their fize, and the foundnefs 

of the ground, is valued at from is 6d. to 3s. per head 

The grounds on the eaft fide of the Etterick are all green, and 
may be called downs, rather than hills ; thofe betwixt Etterick 
unci Tweed are heathy and high •, the Peat-law, and Three 
Brethren, in particular, two of thefe hills, are, the firft 1964, 
and the laft 1978 feet above the level of the fea, and from 
1604 to 1 61 8 above the bed of the river at Selkirk. 

Markets — This place is well fupplied with excellent lamb af- 
ter the 20th of May, and high-flavoured mutton, from the 
20th of June to Martinmas ; and, if the winter is mild, to 
Chriftmas. The veal is not good, but the farmers, who are 
in the habit of buying Highland cattle, and feeding them for 
a year, fupply the market with very fine fmall beeves, and 
make a very good rent, as they buy from L. 3 : 10, to L. 4, 

and fell from L. 6 : 10 to L. 7. A few of the farms that are 

inclofed, have raifed as fine turnips, and exhibit as good a 
breed of cattle, as are to be met with any where. One far- 
mer, this feafon, fed his 3 year olds, from 50 to 60 ftone,

and from 3 to 6 ftone of tallow, and fold them from L. 1 6 to

General State. — The number of fheep in this parifh are com- 
puted to be 22000 : horfes, 265, of which two thirds arc 
farm horfes; black cattle, 735. Valued rent, L. 15826 Scots. 
Real rental, L. 4223 fterling. Country heritors, 17; bur- 
gage heritors, 91 ; farmers, 26. The ftipend 100 guineas, 
per annum, with a manfe and a glebe. The Duke of Rox- 
burgh is patron. The parifh, exclufive of the lands of 

Todridge, •which are detached, and at a confiderable diftance, 
may be about 10 miles fquare. 

Population. — The number of examinable perfons, about 50 
years ago, is faid to have been 1700. The number of foulsj 
as reported to Dr Weblter, for the year 1755, was 1793. By 
an exact furvey, lately made, the number of all ages, now ex- 
ifting, amounts to nearly 700, in the country, and 1000 in 
the burgh *. There is in Selkirk, a meeting of Burgher Se- 
ceders, the only one in the country. What their number may 
be in Selkirk parifh is not accurately known ; but it cannot be 
confiderable. There are no Roman catholics. The medium 
number of births, deaths, and marriages, for the laft 3 years, 
were calculated, and found to be, births, 43 ; deaths, 35 ; 
marriages, 19, annually. 

The Poor. — Poors-rates have long be^n eftablifhed here, to 
the great prejudice of induftry and virtue, among the lower 
clafs of citizens. " The parifh is bound to fupport us," is

their apology for diflipation, through every period of life 

The young men receive, per annum, from L. 6 to L. 8 of wa- 
ges, and the young women, from L. 3 : 10 to L. 4 : to, with 
their maintenance. Labourers, is in fummer, is 2d. in har- 
veft, and iod in winter, per day. Women from 6d. to 8d. in 
fummer, and isinharveft. This, however, is inadequate to 
their expences, when they are in health, and makes them 
a conftant burden upon the public, whenever any misfortune 
happens to them. Such a mode of living is but a miferable 
preparation for the cares of matrimony, and the burden of a 
family. In that ftate, the ruflic beau finks into a peevifh and 
complaining churl. The gaily attired fhepherdefs becomes a 
prey to ftupid infenfibility and floth, equally indifferent about 
her perfon and her houfehold affairs ; and the virtue of 
both, if it hath withftcod the attacks of youthful diflipation, is 
again fubjected to the dangers, which arife from.'the reftlefs 

calls of pinching poverty, and the cries of ftarving infants 

The extinction of fmall farms, which has barred their ambi- 
tion, and damped any fpirit of oeconomy, is here attended 
with fatal effects ; whilft their unfortunate dependance upon 
the poors funds, makes them lefs difpofed to induftrious exer- 
tion. This, too, diffolves the ties of natural affection, while 
it multiplies the number, and increafes- the neceflities of the 
poor. ;. If the children fuffer from the want of economy and 
virtue in their parents, the parents are abundantly repaid by 
the neglect of their children, when bending under the double 
load of infirmity and indigence. They will tell you, without 
a bluvh, that the parifh i.s better able to fupport their aged pa- 
tents, than they are ; while you will fee them, at the fame 
time, in the prime of life, unclcgged with families, in- 
dulging themfelves in every fpecies of debauchery common to 
that rank of life. But the mifchief ends not with them ; ma- 
ny who fill higher ftations, and whofe circumftances are not 

only 



of Selkirk. 445 

only ea'fy but affluent, make their contributing to the poors 
funds an excufe for throwingftheir near relations a burden up- 
on the public. While the feelings of nature are thus ftifled, 
and its laws are thus tranfgrefTed, it were devoutly to be wifh- 
ed, that the laws refpecling the poor, productive of fo many 
baneful confequenccs, would provide this equitable antidote : 
" that all who are in circumftances, and who, by law, would 
fucceed to the property of anyone, were they rich, fhould be oblig- 
ed to maintain them when poor." The public, as it is only the laft 
heir, ought to be only the laft rcfort, of thofe who have none 
elfe to fupport them. From thefe obfervacions, it would ap- 
pear, that poors-rates, without a fyftem of management not 
yet praclifed in the country parifhes, is unfriendly to the caufe 
of virtue in general, and to the beft interefts of thofe they are 
intended to ferve. It is anundoubted fact, that, when peo- 
ple are taught to depend upon any means of fupport, which 
flow not from their own laudable induftry and economy, the 
meannefs of the thought degrades every virtue, and opens the 
door to every vice, that can debafe the foul. Their only de- 
pendance ought to be upon their own labour and exertions, 
which', when joined to economy, will always furnifh them 
with the means of a decent maintenance. Promoting their 
induftry is the belt provifion that can be made for them. Pre- 
miums are chearfully given for the encouragement of com- 
merce: Might not the fame means be employed, for promoting 
virtue and induftry in humble life ? A very fmall fum, pro- 
perly laid out for that purpofe, would do more good, than all 
that is beftowed on the prefent fyftem. With what honour- 
able pride would not the poor man's heart fwell, and with 
what renewed vigour and alacrity, would he not difcharge the 
duties of his ftation, when he felt his virtues publicly regard- 
ed, and rewarded by his fellow citizens? With what fhame 
and remorfe, would not the profligate wretch endeavour to 

conceaj 



446 Statijlkal Account 

conceal his mifery, ' defpifed and condemned by thofe* among 
whom he lived, and without any juft claim to their affiftance ? 
Even during the infirmities of age, their fupport fhould be a 
voluntary gift, and not compulfatory, and fhould depend upon 
the charader they maintained, in their early days, for their 
honefty and virtue. 

The number of the poor, though gradually increafing, con- 
ftantly varies. . There were, upon the roll of laft year, in the 
country part of the parifh, 20 ; and the annual fum provided 
for their relief, was L. 54 : 12. In the burgh, the number 
was 22, the fum provided was L. 60. 

The collections, at the church- door, are dedicated to the 
relief of incidental misfortunes, among thofe who have no 
fhare in the fund above mentioned, or who happen to fall in- 
to circumftances of peculiar diftrefs, between the meetings of 
the managers. By thefe means, many are prevented from 
coming upon the funds, to which, on every occafion, they 
difcover a ftrong propensity, and which it is not always eafy 
to hinder. 

All the money mortified to the poor of this parifh, is 20» 
merks, the donation of William Ogilvie, Efq. of Hartwood- 
mires ; of which, the kirk-feffion are managers. 

Scarcity in 1782. The parifh produces much more grain, 

(wheat excepted) than is fufficient for the fupport of the in- 
habitants. In 1782, however, the crop was very deficient, 

and the poor were'reduced to very great diftrefs To encreafe 
the poors funds proportionally was a dangerous experiment, 
and could only extend to fuch as were upon the roll. To re- 
lieve the neceffities of all the indigent, by donation sin meal or 
money, was impoffible. A fchtme, much more effectual than 
either, was adopted by the town of Selkirk : — They put L. 50 
^lto the hands of a citizen well acquainted with the ftate of 

the

ihe country, and the visual trade, with power to purchafe 
meal, wherever he found it of the beft quality, and moft rea- 
fonable, and to retail it at prime coft, among the parifhioners. 
By thefe means all were regularly fupplied, below the retail 
price, till that was reduced from 2S iod. to 2s 2d. per flone. 
By this plan, the town lofi only the intereft of the L. 50, and 
is per day to their agent, while they did a more effential fer- 
vice to the whole inhabitants of the parifli, than if 100 gui- 
neas had been diftributed amongft them. Even the poor of 
other pariihes, when meal was not elfewhere to be had, 
were permitted to (hare in the advantages of this plan. 

Mifcellaneous Obfcrvations. — The rivers, fields, and woods, 
in the neighbourhood, abound with all the fifh, game, birds of 
fong, of prey, and of the migratory fpeeies, common in the 
fouthern parts of Scotland. Among the multitude of fpar- 
rows, bred in the thatched roofs of the houfes in Selkirk, one 
appeared, fome years ago, perfectly v\ hite. It was more {len- 
der and more beautiful in its appearance, than the common 
fparrows, and, in fome refpe&amp;s, refembled a canary birdj 

but was of a purer and more glofly white. There is 

at Haining-Lin, in the neighbourhood of Selkirk, a fpring of 
fteel water ; from which, though it is but weak, the poor of 

a fcorbutic or fchrophulous habit, derive advantage . 

The only foffil, that merits attention in this place, is, an inet- 
hauftible fund of {hell marie. It produces wonderful effects 
upon light and dry foils; but its utility to the country in ge- 
neral, muft depend upon the .difcretion with which it ufed, 

and the terms at which it can be -purchnfed. In this parifh, 

there remain no monuments of antiquity, but fome military 
ftations, and a foffee perfectly vifible on both fides of the Yar-

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2356464">FORTINGAL</name>. 

(COUNTY OF PERTH.) 

By the Rev. Mr. Duncan MAra.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Soil, Izfc. 

FORTINGAL, it is thought, derives its name from a Ro- 
man camp, at the weft end of the diftric~t. A late hilto- 
rian, and fome others, have thought, that Agricola fought 
•with the Caledonians on that fpot ; but this does not feem pro- 
bable ; as he would have been necefiarily expofed to infinite 
danger, in marching through woods, and numerous defiles, 
before he could have reached that place. The encampment 
itfelf, however, might give rife to the name, as Feart-nin-gal t 
in the Gaelic, fignifies, the works or exploits of ftrangers. 
To Fortingal, is joined another parochial diftrict, called 

Kilchonan. Both lie in the middle of the Grampian hills 

This parifh, compofed of thefe two, is the fartheft to the 
north- weft of the county of Perth, and the mod Highland pa- 
rifh in Perthfhire. It lies within the fynod of Perth and 
Stirling, and prefbytery of Dunkeld. Its boundaries may be 
feen in Stobie's map of Perthshire. Its length will be full 37 

miles; its mean breadth about 17. it confifts of the 

following diftricts ; Fortingal, Glenlyon, and Kanoch; be-

fules an eilate of 16 ploughs, containing 8 villages, fituated 
fouth of Tay-bridge, 8 miles diftant from the manfe and 
church. 

The diftri£t of Fortingal, including lands that run in a line 
with it, which are in the parifli, is near 5 miles in length. 
The river Lyon runs through the bottom, which is net above 
half a mile in breadth ; but the hills are in tillage pretty high 
up. It is a fertile beautiful bottom. The foil is dry, light, 
and rather gravellifh. Woods and clumps of trees are in a- 
bundance, and have a fine effect. There are 26 villages, or 
little towns in it. 

From the weft point of it, the road leads to Glenlyon ; — an 
exceeding long narrow glen ; — in tillage, and inhabited for 
28 miles weftward. The plain, by the fide of the river, is 
generally not above a gun-fhot over. There is a continued 
ridge of fome of the higheft mountains in the kingdom, on 
both fides of this glen. Many of the villages have not any 

funfhine, for 3 or 4 months in winter. The grazings and 

fhealings, belonging to the country, extend 8 miles farther 
weftward : and there fome fhepherds refide even in winter. 
The hills are green, almoft half way up, and afford excellent 

pafture The air, in two-thirds of this country, is fome- 

what chilly, but abundantly dry and healthy. In the braes 
it is moift and cold. The foil below, is of the fame quality 
with that in Fortingal. The productions of both, however, 
ripen as early as thofe of any other part of the county. In the 

head of the diftri£t, the foil is good, but the climate bad 

The crop feldom comes to any kind of perfection. There are 
28 villages here, all in a line, belonging to the parifh. 

From the eaftmoft corner of Fortingal, the road leads to 
Ranoch, the neareft village of which, is 1 1 miles diltanc 
1 from this place. This county, from near Tumble bridge, 
where it begins, is 21 miles in length ; the bottom about a 
2 mile 



of Fortingal. 45 1 

mile in breadth. The grazings, north and north-weft, ex- 
tend 7 or 8 miles, Mill further beyond the inhabited part of 
the country. It is highly elevated; the air is uncommonly 
moift, damp, and cold. The foil, at the bottom of the coun- 
try, is good, intermixed with mofs and clay, but dirty. The 
foil, on both fides of che loch, is very indifferent ; and, at the 
head of the country, is exceedingly bad. Mildews often ruin 
all the crops. There are many large woods of birch, and a 
pretty extenfive fir wood, which grows naturally, and ferves 
all the country round with excellent timber. This is all that 
remains of that immenfe foreit of fir, which once covered the 
muirs in this part of the Highlands. Every where the country 
people dig for roots of fir, in the moffes, both for light and 
firewood. In Ranoch, there are 32 villages in the parifh, 
and 3 belonging to the parifh of Logierait. 

Hills, Lakes, Rivers, tsfc As to hills, lakes, rivers, and 

muirs, we have them in abundance* Loch-Ranoch, in the 
middle of that country, is 1 2 miles long -, Loch-Errack, a 
part of which is in this parifh, is in length 24 miles. They 
are both about a mile in breadth. Befides thefe, there are 
Loch-Lyon, and a number of fmall lochs, fcattered through 
the muirs ; fome of them a mile in length. All thefe are ftor- 
ed with a vaft variety of trout, perch, &amp;c. In Ranoch they 
catch trouts from 1 lb. to 24 lb. weight. 

The great rivers are the Lyon, the Errack, and the Gauir. 
The two latter, when they iffue from Loch-Ranoch, are cal- 
led the Tumble, a river as large as the Tay, where they join. 
In the Lyon, falmon are caught from the beginning of April, 
to September, and are fold from 4d. to 6d. a pound. 

Thichallin, (which fignifies the Maiden's Breaft, its form 
being quite round,) is one of the higheft hills in the ifland. 
According to one menfuration, its height is 3,564 feet ; ac-

cording to another, 3,587 feet above the level of the fea, 
Some of the hills of Glenlyon, and Bein Ardlanich, in Ra- 
noch, are not much lower. 

There is a fine fountain, iffuing from the foot of Thichal- 
lin; to which' people refort, when they have any graveliifh 
complaint. It is highly diuretic, and carries off fand and fmall 
ftones, through the urinary paflages. 

There are feveral fmall veins of lead ore, jutting out here 
and there, in the rocks, behind Fortingal. There is one in 
Glenlyon, that had been wrought for a fhort fpace, about 60 
years ago ; but it did not anfwer the expence. Perhaps this 
was, in fome meafure, owing, to there being no roads in the 
country, at that time, (everything being then carried on horfe- 
back), which occafioned too much expence, in tranfporting 
the ore, &amp;c. 

Population, Horfes, Sheep, &amp;c. The number of fouls is 

3,914. The return to Dr Webfter was 3,859. But the pre- 
fent incumbent, who then held the living, fent only the a- 
mount of his examination roll. It is not known, whether Dr 
Webfter, as in the cafe of Largs, (fee p. 362,) calculated, 
from certain data, the number of fouls, from the amount of 
examinable perfons reported to him; or whether, he fuppofed, 
the number returned contained the whole inhabitants in the 
parifh. There is every reafon to believe, that the females are 
600 more than the males. The iegifter of baptifms is nei- 
ther exadl nor complete. There were regiftered, during the 
3 years preceding 1791, as follows ; 98, — 108, — 1 12 : a good 
many years ago, the number of baptifms was 1 24. Marria- 
ges in thefe years, were 32, — 30, — 36. No account at all 
can be given of the deaths, owing to there being 7 different 
burial grounds. According to the beft information, that can 
be got, there are 487 children below 5, and 447 between 5 
and 10 years of age. It may be added, that fewer children 

die 



ofFortingal. 453 

die in the Highlands, than almoft any where, particularly 
fince inoculation has been fo univerfally praclifed ; which it 
has been, for a good many years back, to the faving of many 
Jives. 

In general, the people are pretty long lived. Many are be- 
tween 80 and 90 ; — fome between 90 and 100 ; a few live be- 
yond that age. There is, at prefent, a gentleman, living, 
and ftill healthy and ftrong, aged 103, who attended a fune- 
ral the firft year of this century, and bore arms under the 
Marquis of Atholl, the year before the Union. We have al- 
fo a woman born the fame year with him. The prefent in- 
cumbent likewife knew, about 30 years ago, one Donald Ca- 
meron, who lived, it was credibly afierted, to the amazing 
.age of 127 ! 

The number of tenants is 354 ; of crofters 105 ; of cotta- 
gers, 250; of men fervants, 152; of maid fervants, 289. A- 
mong the cottagers are the handy- crafts-men, who ferve the 
country. 

The parifh is, at leaft in fome diftricls of it, greatly depo- 
pulated, fince the year 1754. No lefs than 105 tenants have 
been removed, and between 60 and 70 cottagers. The com- 
mifhoners, upon the lately annexed tftates, began this, by let- 
ting extenfive farms, and others have followed the example. 
Upon the whole, the population is faid to have decreafed by 
fome hundreds, fince that time. Some, but not many, have 
emigrated to America. The moft of them have gone fouth - 
ward to the towns. 

There are no Papifts, Seceders, nor Jacobites, although the 
latter were formerly numerous. There are about a dozen of 
Epifcopalians. 

The people here live, a full half of the year, moftly upon po- 
tatoes. This root, with a little milk, butter, beef, or mut- 
ton, which the tenants commonly have, makes excellent food.

Even the poor, have about half a year's proviGon from pota- 
toes ; which they eat along with a little butter, and the flefh 
of an old fheep or two, which they kill for that purpofe. 

The number of horfes is 819; of cows, 2310; of fheep, 
27,286, or nearly fo. The value of a highland cow is fiom 
L. 3 to L. 4. Two year old wedders fell from 8s. to 10s. three 
year olds, from 1 is to'i^s. 

Rent, Heritors, Stipend, Zs'c— — The rent of this parifl), in- 
cluding the gentlemens farms, is full L. 4,660. The flipend, 
befides glebe and grafs, worth about L. 4 a year, is L.55 : 1 1 io^ 
with allowance of L. 5 : 1 1 : c\ for communion elements. The 
charge is uncommonly laborious. For two fabbaths, the m»- 
nifter preaches at Fortingal ; the third at 13 ; the fourth at 15 ; 
anu the fifth at 24 miles diftance, in different parts of his pa- 
rifh. At prefent he has an itinerant minifter to affift 
him. 

There are 1 1 heritors in the parifh, 8 of whom refide in it. 
There has been but little change of property for a century 
paft •, only fome wadfets turned into feus, or exchanges of 
feus. The Gaelic is the language that is commonly fpoken. 

Poor. — The poor beg from houfe to houfe. Such as are 
deemed fit objects, have affiftance from the funds, according 
to their neceffities. The funds arife from the weekly collec- 
tions, and from fmal! fines. The amount of the flock at pre- 
fent, is L. 92. Collections are about L. 36 per annum. Three 
different and diftant places in the parifh, have each their k'ak- 
feffions, and boxes, as they are cnlled. At three different 
times, when meal was uncommonly fcarce, from L. 10 to 
L. '5- at a time, was expended, to bring meal to the country.

to refufe an alms, or a night's quarters to a poorperfon 

There are a great many beggars from other places. The on- 
ly grievance, in this refpec~t, is from fwarms of tinkers, tai- 
lors, and vagrants, from the great towns, who, by dreadful 
imprecations and threatenings, extort charity, and immedi-

makers, and day labourers, get 6d, carpenters 8d, and ma- 
fons I4d, befwles maintenance. 

The general run of farms is, from 4 to 6 acres laboured 
land. Some few have 12 acres; ftill fewer have double that 
quantity. The rent is principally paid for the graft. The 
whole tenants of the pariih are rcftricled to a certain number 
of cattle, which they mult not exceed. A crcfter pays for an 
acre of ground, and the privilege of keeping a cow and 6 
Ihecp, L. 1 : 1 3 : 4 ; for 2, double that fum. A tenant, for his 
5 or 6 acres, 2 horfes, 10 cows, and their followers, 100 fheep 
and their lambs, pays L. 20, and a little more fometimes. Few 
of the tenants have a man fervant. A village or two, join a- 
bout a fhepherd. The fheep are never houfed, the ftorms ne- 
ver being heavy, owing to the wefterly fituation. 

We have no ale-houfes, but ten whifky houfes. The con- 
fumption of this fpirit is not half what it was.

Schools — The Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge 
have erected 4 charity fchools in the parifh. The falary of 
their fchoolmafters is L. 10. The people, who are diftant 
from thefe, and the parifh fchool, pay for a boy to teach their 
children to read and write. We have 6 of thefe private 
fchools. 

Cttrio/itits, and Mifrellaneous Obfcrvat'ions. — Among our cu- 
riofities, may be reckoned a yew tree, in the church yard 
of FortingaJ, 5a feet round. An old act of parliament, or- 
dered all the burial grounds in the kingdom, to be planted with 
yews for bows. This is probably the only remaining one, and 
an extraordinary tree it is. 

The Roman camp, already mentioned, is certainly the far- 
theft inland one, of any that has been hitherto obferved. The 
ditch and rampart are filled up, or broken down, in many pla- 
ces, by the plough. The Praetorium is quite complete : The 
area within is about 80 acres. The late Lord Breadalbine em- 
ployed fome labourers to dig for antiquities : all they got was 
three urns. Roman coins have been got in different places, 
in the country adjacent. 

There are a great many forts throughout every diftricl: in 
the parifh. They are circular, from 30 to 50 feet diameter, 
built with immenfe ftones. One would wonder, how they 
could be moved, without machines. Their height is inconfi • 
derable, not above 5 feet ; but a good many of the ftones have 
fallen. They are in view of one another, which would make 
one think they might be alarm towers. They extend from 
Dunkeld to Glenorchy, and perhaps farther. There are two 
much larger, that had outworks *

■ Before tlie year 1745, Ranoch was in an uncivilized bar- 
barous Mate, under no check, or reitraint of laws. As an e- 
videnee of this, one of the principal proprietors, never could 
be compelled to p.ry his debts* Two meffengcrs were fent 
from Perth, to give him a charge cf horning. He ordered a 
dozen of his retainers to bind them acrofs two hand-barrows, 
ttnd carry them, in this ftate, to the bridge of Cainachan, at 
9 miles diibnee. His property in particular was a neft of 
thieves. They laid the whole country, from Stirling to Cou- 
par of Angus, under contribation, obliging the inhabitants to 
pay them, Black Meal, as it 'n called, to fave their property 
from being plundered. This was the center of this kind of 
traffic. In the months of September and October, they ga- 
thered to the number of about 300, built temporary hute, 
drank whifky all the time, fettled accounts for ftolen cattle, 
..iul received balances. Every man then bore arms. It would 
have reo,uired a regiment to have brought a thief from that 
country- But Government having font a party of foldiers to

are now as hone ft, and as ftricT: a fet of people, in thefe mat-, 
ters, as any in the kingdom. 

In the year 1754, the country was almoft impaflable. There 
were no roads, nor bridges. Now, by the ftatute-labour, we 
have got excellent roads, and 12 bridges. In a few years, we 
fhall have other two, which is all that could be defired. The 
people contribute chearfully and liberally to build them, and 
this preferves many lives. 

At the above period, the bulk of the tenants in Ranoch had 
no fuch thing as beds. They lay on the ground, with a little 
heather, or fern, under them, One firigle blanket was all 
their bed-cloaths, excepting their body-cloaths. Now they 
have ftanding-up beds, and abundance of blanket?. At that 
time, the houfes in Rannoch were huts of, what they called, 
" Stake and Rife." One could not enter but on all fours ; and 
after entering, it was impoffible to ftand upright. Now there 
are comfortable houfes built of ftone. Then the people were 
miferably dirty, and foul-lkinned. Now they are as cleanly; 
and are clothed as well as their circumftances will admit of. 
The rents of the parifh, at that period, were not much above 
L. 1500, and the people were ftarving. Now they pay L.4660 
per annum, and upwards, and the people have fulnefs of 
bread. 

It is hardly poffible to believe, on how little the Highland- 
ers formerly lived. They bled their cows feveral times in the 
year, boiled the blood, eat a little of it like bread, and a moft 
lading meal it was. The prefent incumbent has known a 
poor man, who had a fmall farm hard by him, by this means, 
with a boll of meal for every mouth in his family, pafs the 
whole year. 

The circumftances, which have occafioned the greater wealth 
and abundance of the prefent times, are, the planting of fo 
many potatoes, the advance in the price of cattle and fheep, 

the 



of Fortingal.

(lie greaier induftry of the people, the ftop that has been put 
to the depredations of thieves, and the people, inftead of rear- 
ing black cattle, having turned their farms into meep walks, 
which they find much more profitable. Thefe are likewife the 
caufes of the great rife of rent. In 1754, the tenants planted 
perhaps one lippie or two of potatoes. Now they plant a boll, 
two bolls, or more. They keep the potatoe ground very clean. 
The general increnfe is 12 bolls or more. Few fewed any 
lintfeed at that time. Perhaps there were not two hogfheads 
fown in the pariih. Now there are perhaps 24 hogfheads fown 
yearly, every tenant and crofter having from one to four lip- 
pies. The increafe is about one (tone from the lippie. The 
wives and maids fpin the flax ; the yarn is purchafed by deal- 
ers, who travel over the country for that purpofe, and by 
whom it is fent to Perth or Glafgow. 

The people here marry young. Either owing to the climate, 
their moderate labour, their temperate living, or other caufes, 
they have an uncommonly numerous offfpring. This is the 
reafon, why the Highlands are a nurfery, for raifing fo many 
ufeful hands, for the countries below them. It is almoft incre- 
dible to tell, what fwarms leave the country every year, and 
go to the fouth for fervice. Almoft all the boys, from to to 

15, go to tend fheep or cattle, and learn a little Englifh. 

Many of them afterwards go into fervice, or to handicraft em- 
ployments, and never return. Befides thefe, crofters, cotta- 
gers, and day-labourers, who can earn no bread at home, fee 
out for the great towns to get employment. Our extenfive 
(beep-walks are certainly, in that refpeel a lofs to the public. 
It is now exceedingly difficult to raife recruits among us. At- 
tachment to chieftains and lairds is dying away. Labour is not 
fuch a burden as it was ; And what, more than every thing 
elfe, makes it difficult to recruit, is, that the people know the 
fecurity and protection which the law affords them.

No manufactures can be eftablifhed here, owing to the 
fcarcity of meal and fuel. Perhaps it might be mere for the 
public and private advantage, if the people fliould fpin their 
wool infeead of lint, and fend it to market in that ftate. Im- 
menfe packs of wool are fent away every year to Perth, Stir- 
ling, ic- The wool is coarfe, owing to the fouth country 
breed we have got among us, and fells only from 7s to 8s per 
ftor.e. 

The great grievances, under which this panfh labours, are, 
the largenefs of fome of the farms, and there being fcarce any 
leafes. In regard to the firft, it is quefticnable, whether the 
great farmers can afford to p.iy as high rents, as the moderate- 
ly large ones, as they live in z ftile of much greater luxury and 
expence. As to the fecontl point, no great improvements can 
be expected ; at leaft on the part of the tenants, whiJft the 
tenure, by which they hold their lands, continues fo tempo- 
rary and precarious. 

In regard to the general character of the people, they are as 
induftrious, pious and chaiitable as any of their neighbours, 
or perhaps any in the kingdom,

<p>Origin of the Names. 

THESE parifhes commonly go by the name of the united 
' parifhes of Blair-Atholl, and Strowan. They con- 
fided formerly of the parifhes of Blair Atholl, Strowan, 
Lude, and Kilmavconog. Blair (Blhr) properly fignifics a 
plain clear of woods and other incumbrances ; but the Cel- 
tic, of whom the Gael were a branch, in general, chuling 
fuch plains for their fields of battle, Blar came at length to 
fignify a battle. Siroivan (Sruthain) fignifies ftreams, 
fo called from the confluence of the Garry and the Erochty at 
that place. Thefe ftreams feem to have given that paiifti its

(Lfotd) feems to fignify declivities, where a plough could 
bring a furrow only one way. The antient Celtic names of 
places and things, were generally fhort defcriptions of them, 
though, in fome cafes, they alfo originated from remarkable 
perfons, and accidental circumftanccs. It is the more necef- 
fary to afcertain thefe derivations note,, as the country fenach- 
ies, cr hifiorians, who, in general, can belt account for thefe 
things, are daily growing worfe, as labour becomes harder, 
and more indifpenfable. No time, therefore, fliould be loft, 
in collecting what information yet remains, regarding thefe 
particulars, before it is entirely gone, perhaps, never to be re- 
covered. 

Situation, Extent, and Surface. Thefe united parifhes 

are Gtuated in the Shire of Perth, in the prefbytery of Dun- 
keld, and the fynod of Perth and Stirling. Their extent is 
upwards of 30 miles in length ; and, allowing for the af- 
cents and defcents of the hills, above 1 8 miles in breadth — 
Through a large tract of country, the furface and appearan- 
ces are various. On the fummits of the high mountains, the 
weather has left little elfe than gravel and ftones, covered 
with mqfs. This part is called Creachonn (creach-fhoim), 
i. e. robbed land, the foil having been blown, or wafhed away, 
a good way down the fides. Farther down is heath, uva ur- 
fi, the craw-berry plant ; on mofiy or boggy places, the cloud- 
berry plant, and on drier ground, the whortle-berry-buih, 
with coarfe grafs. Lower down is heath, peat-bog, valleys

full of pretty good pasture, and here and there a green fpor, 
with huts upon them ; to which the women, children, and 
herds, retire with the cattle for the fummer fcafon. De- 
fcending ftill farther down, the air and the foil generally 
change for the better; but, in fome places, the hills, within 
%ht of the rivers, are Honey and bad. The veftiges of the 
plough are often feen much higher up, than it goes at pre- 
fent ; probably becaufe the wood then, made higher places 

warmer, and much of the bottom was a thicket In the 

fides of the glens and valleys, the foil is various •, — in feveral 
places it is thin and light, as it is alfo in the bottoms, where 
the rivers once ran •, in other places it is good, efpecially 
where the veins of limeftone run from N. E. to S. W. through 
the country. In the fummer feafon, the face of the country 
is green, with corn, grafs, and wood. In the bottom of eve- 
ry glen and valley, there is a river, or ftream ; and in fome of 
them, a loch, or lake. An extenfive ftrath, or valley, lies a- 
long the Garry, from the Kirktown of Strowan, for 6 miles 
downwards • and Strath-tummel runs along the loch of that 
name, which is 2 miles long. The reft of the pariih confifle 
of many glens, along the rivulets, that fall from the moun- 
tains, and of rocks, and extenfive hills ; of which very* little 
more is capable of cultivation. 

Mountains and Hills. — In thefe pariflies are many confidera- 
ble mountains *, but the mod remarkable of them are Beinn- 
deirg, i. e. the Red Mountain, (fo callea from a vein of red 
(tone, faid to be a kind of granite), which rifes 3550 feet a- 
bove the level of the fea ; and Bekm-glo, the higheft pinnacle 
of which, Carn-nan-gour, i. e. the Mountain of Goats, rifes 
3724 feet above the faid level. 

Srath-dhrnaidh, in Strath-groy, is one of thofe roundifh 
green hilis, that they callSioth dhun, i. e. the Hill of Peace*

becaufe on the fe they made peace, and other contracts of old, 
They probably reckoned the matters here tranfatled, the more 
fblemn, too, that they believed the Sighichin, or Fairies, 
fappofed to dwell in thofe hills, to be witnefles of their tran- 
sactions*. Thefe hills were generally natural, but fomet imes 
artificial. The Duni-pacis of Buchanan, (in Englifh, Duni- 
pace,) is a literal transition of Sioth-dhun. 

There is alfo another kind of a deep green hill, in thefe 
countries, and in Ireland, called Rath and Rata, from Rati), 
•and Roith, a wheel ; becaufe, being generally conical, at 
lead in part, their bafes were round like a wheel, or circular. 
Chieftains and great men had their houfes frequently on the 
tops of fuch ; becaufe they were difficult of accefs on all fides. 
Thefe gave names to many places, as, Rata-mhili (Vili) or 
the Soldier's Rath or Rata, 4 miles above Dunkeld •, Lagan- 
rata, Logynute ; near which, one of our King Roberts had a 
flrong houfe, above the boat of Tummel. Rothymurchus, 
Rtrath, Sec. are from the fame root. 

Climate mid Diftvif s. — The foil of thefe paridies would be 
much more productive cf corn, grafs, and even wood, were 
the climate but nearly proportionable to it. But fometimes 
the raiiib hurt the crops, efpecialiy in harved. Sometimes we 
have fnow too early, or too late ; but, what is word of all, we 
have much cold, froRy weather, piereing northerly winds, 
and blading fogs and hoar-frods, particularly along the rivers, 
which either hurt the growth of vegetables, or dedroy them 
after they are grown up. The cokinefs and iharpnefs of the 
air, too, muft, in fome degree, {Hat the growth, and render 
the faces of the people more thin and dry, than otherwife they 
would be. 

The air, in general, ir. not remarkably moid or dry ; nor 
are the innabitants greatly fubject to any particular didem.

pers. The fmall-pox in the natural way, and the meafles, are 
among the moft fatal. Fevers are generally brought thither 
from the low countries ; cold, colics, pleuritic fevers, rheu- 
matifms, confumptions, &amp;c. are rather accidental, than ne- 
ceffary confequences of the climate, which is, in general, falu- 
brious. On the other hand, the inhabitants are not remark- 
able for longevity. Many live to 75 ; fewer to 80, fewer ftill 
to 90, and the inflances are very rare of any that approach to 
100 years of age. A perfon, however, died about 3 years ago, 
who was faid to have wanted but little of it. Although the 
climate be healthy, the body of the people have not, by any 
means, the conveniencies of life, that are neceflary to nurfe 
old age. 

Lochs, Rivers, and Mineral Springs — There are many lochs, 
and two confiderable rivers, (the Tummel and the Garry,) in the 
parifh. Salmon come up the Tummel to the Fall, which is a 

little above the confluence of the two rivers. But the arts 

that are now pv.uftifed, by the fifhers below, let very few 
falmon the length of either river ; and the fteeping of flax, in 
running waters, hurts the fifh of every kind. The rivulets are 
the Erochty, the 'Bruir, and the Tilt. The Tummel overflows 
a deal of ground. The Erochty and Garry are, conftantly, 
tearing their banks, and altering their channels. The Garry 

deftroys a fine plain for 6 miles below Strowan. There are 

many chalybeate fprings, but none of th~m famous, or re for t- 
ed to; indeed, their virtues are not inveftigated, or attended to. 

W oods. — There is no extenfive wood in the parifh, but ma- 
ny fmall ones. The lad century, and the beginning of the 
prefent, have deftroyed much wood, by fire and otherwife.— • 
Places ftill bear the name of woods, where there is not a tree

and other vermin, induced people to deftroy them ; but they 
did not know when to ftop, and fo went too far. The woods 
are now better looked after. The Dukes of Atholhave plant- 
ed a good deal, and Mr Robertfon of Lude fome. The pre- 
vailing kinds of timber are birch, alder, afh, oak, poplar, and 
hazle j the fhrubs are willow, broom, bog-gall, heath, &amp;c. 
Wood thrives very well in this country. 

G. &amp;c. — ln an extenfive foreft, and over many other 
parts of the hills, there are a great number of red deer ; in 
and near the woods, there are roe-deer ; almoft every where 
there are plenty of hares, and, on the high mountains, white 

hares, which, in fummer, have bluifh fpors.- In the 

hills and woods, are foxes, wild cats, pole cats, martins, 
weafles, and flirew mice : in the waters, otters. We have alfo 

two fpecies of the badger. Of the winged kind, there are, 

on the tops of the mountains, ptarmagans ; in the hills, groufe-, 
near the woods, black game, and patridges below. The 
ravenous birds are, eagles, buzzards, hawks of various kinds, 
ravens, carion crows, and magpies. The migratory birds are 
fimilar to thofe ufual in the Highlands. 

Population. In Auguft 1791, there were living in the li- 
nked pariflies, 3120 fouls, viz. 1480 males, and 1640 fe- 
males. Of that number, 758 were under eight years of age. 
The yearly average of marriages, for the laft 10 years, was 
nearly 26; and the yearly average of baptifms, for the fame 
period, was 94. Belides the number above mentioned, there 
is a conliderable number of young people, belonging to the 
parifti, ferving in the eaft and weft ; of whom part will pro- 
bably return, and part will not. 

Though it cannot be exa&amp;ly determined, the probability is, 
that the number of the people in this parifh is diminiihed, 

owing

©•wing to feveral caufes. When people of fmall landed pro- 
perty no longer lived upon the produce of their eftates, but 
followed the example of their wealthier neighbours, in the 
ufe of foreign commodities, they contracted debt, fold their 
eltates, and went to puili their fortunes elfewhere. When 
the jurifdiction a£t took place, and men of landed property 
could not make their tenants fight their battles, they became 
lefs careful of having clever fellows about them, and fo began 
to confider, how they might make the mod of that clafs of 
men in another way. Then the rents began to be raifcd, the 
farms to be enlarged, much land to be taken into the land- 
lord's domain, and the fhepherd and his dog to be the inhabi- 
tants of farms, that formerly maintained many families ; 
though this laft particular is not, as yet, fo much the cafe 
here, as it is in many other places. In confequence of thefe 
changes, fome of the tenants are become cottagers ; fome have 
removed to towns, to gain a livelihood by labour ; and a few 
have emigrated to America, though that fpirit is not become 
very common here as yet. The return to DrWebfter, how- 
ever, being only 3257 fouls, the decreafe has been inconfide- 
rable. 

Number of Proprietors. — There are atprefent only eleven he- 
ritors, one of whom (the Duke of Athol) poiTefies at leaft one 
half of the parifh. Five of thefe, either occaGonally, or con- 
ftantly, refide in it. 

Tenants.— The tenants, who hold from a half to a whole 
merk land, have been reckoned about 240, paying from L. 5 
to L. 10 rent ; and thofe who pay from L. 10 toL. 70 only 20. 
Tradefman (mechanics,) labourers, and cottagers, who have 
pendicles, may amount to 85, paying from 15s to L. 2 per 
acre.. Only one tenant has a very large tract of arable ground.

Number of Acres and Rent. Without a particular meafure- 
ment, it is impoflible to give the exacl: number of acres in the 
parifh. From the general maps, the fum total is reckoned 
to be about 130,000 Scots acres; and, of thefe, not above 
4000 are at prefent under tillage. The valued rent is 
L. 4204 : 18:8. This fum bears a very fmall proportion to 
the real rent, which it is not eafy to give, becaufe it is con- 
ftantly rifing. 

Number of Horfes. Some think, there may about iooe 
horfes, large and fmall, in the parifh ftill. Before the intro- 
duction of fheep farms, and the keeping of diftintt marches, 
a number of the common people had fmall horfes in the hills, 
all the year round, excepting in the time of deep fnow, when 
their owners brought them home, and helped them with fod- 
der. At a certain time of the year, each caught and marked 
his own, and broke them for his own ufe, or fold fuch as 
were fit for work, except the breeding mares. During the reft 
of the year, they ranged, where they pleafed, through the 
hills. As they cannot do this any longer, they are almoft ex- 
tirpated, and the price of horfes has rifen beyond all bounds. 

Number of Sheep and Black Cattle. — Formerly, almoft every 
tenant had a fmall number of fheep ; at prefent, many of them 
have none. There are now, in the parifh, 4 confiderable 
ftocks of fheep ; two of them belonging to the principal 
heritors ; but the others to fheep farmers. They confift of 
from 1000 to upwards of 2000 fheep each; which, added to 
what the tenants have, according to the old method, may a- 
mount to upwards of 16,000 fheep in all. The number of black 
cattle may be from 2000 to 3000. The goats art almoft 
gone. 



Crop. 



of Blair-Atholl and Strowan.

Crops. — The principal crops are barley, oats, potatoes, and 
flax, with fome peafe and rye. In high, wet, and late grounds, 
they ufe early oats. The proprietors, and fuch tenants as 
have inclofed land, fow turnips, clover, and rye-grafs. The 
feed-time and harveft are rather late, than otherwife, efpe- 
cially in the glens. Grain of all kinds is dearer here, than in 
the low countries. Some fruit is raifed 5 but the country, 
in general, is too high and frofty for orchard?. 

Imports and Exports. — The common imports are feed-corn, 
of the different kinds, meal, and barley for a few ft ills. The 
potatoes have confiderably leffened the demand for meal. As 
to foreign articles, they are the fame as people of the fame 
rank and abilities import elfewhere. Our exports are a few 
black cattle, fheep, and linen-yarn. It was this laffc article 
which principally brought ready money into the country, to 
pay the rents. The materials were raifed at home ; and almoft 
every one had a fhare in that bufinefs. It has already felt the 
baneful effe&amp;s of the cotton manufactures, the materials of 
which are brought from afar, and by which few gain in pro- 
portion. 

Churchy feV — The Duke of Athol is patron. The ftipend

Poor. — By ■&amp; gift and mortification of the Marquis of A- 
thol's, dated in 1687, provifion was made, in meal and mo- 
ney, for fix poor men in the parifh •, which is now divided a- 
mong eight men, prefented by the Duke, as follows : Six men 
have each 2 bolls of oat meal, and L- 4 Scots, yearly, and each 
of the other two has L. 8 : 6 : 8d. Scots. The number of the 
»ther poor, who receive alms, is, at an average, about 7$.

The annual amount of the collections at the church-door,

Sterling. The intereft of this fum, and the above collections, 
are diftributed among them, by the feffion, and as nearly pro- 
portioned to their circumftances, as can be done ; the largeft 
(hares being given to fuch as are confined to their beds, and it 
is carried to their houfes by the elders. The above fum of near 
L.200, confifts partly of mortifications ; and he who is ap- 
pointed to one of them, recedes whatever the intereft of the 
mortification amounts to. Such of the poor as can travel 
through the parilh, receive lefs from the funds ; becaufe they 
«an gather their fubfiftence among their neighbours, with 
whom meal, and other provifions, are more plentiful than 
money. When it is judged expedient, intimation is given, 
from the pulpit, the heritors meet, on a day appointed, infpect 
the feffion-books, and give what orders, concerning the poor, 
they judge necefTary, 

Morals. The moft common vices here, are fuch as 

may be expected in that ftate of fociety, where the people 
are poor, and where the moft extenfive farmers have but 

little to themfelves after paying the landlord. But 

there are very few instances of capital crimes : Suicide is 
fcarcely known, murders very rare, executions and banifh- 
ments very uncommon ; a very moderate exertion of the ci- 
vil magiftrate, and execution of the laws, would be fufficient 
to maintain good order among the people. They are, in ge- 
neral, become induftrious, and improve their land by lime, 
marie, and otherwife. They have a reafonable fhare of acute- 
nefs, are difpofed to be friendly to one another, hofpitable to 
ftrangers, and charitable to the poor. The gentlemen are 
tall and handfome, and fond of a military life j and, though

the common people have learned to defpife a foldier's pay, 
and to hate a life of fervitude, yet they have ftill a deal of the 
martial fpirit remaining, and make very good foldiers, when 
once they undertake it; being firm, hardy, and brave, though 
not generally tall. Seven or eight hundred of them attended 
the Marquis of Montrofe, till after the battle of Kilfyth, and 
fignalized themfelves by their fidelity and valour. With re- 
gard to religion, they have not many difputes, nor do they 
make much noife about it ; but, in general, they attend the 
church, and religious ordinances, with gravity, decency, and 
every appearance of fmcerity ; and many of them enter 
deeply into fome of the mod important points of controverfy 
among Chriftians. 

Language The Gaelic language is fpoken here, by the 

natives ; and there are but few others in the parifh. It was 
in all probability, the firft language fpoken in this country. 
That it gave the antient names to place3 is clear. There are, 
indeed, a few names, fuch as dour, cabar, &amp;c. that are as 
common among the Welfh, as among us ; but whether thefe 
names have been originally given by a colony of Welfh, or by 
the Caledonians, or Picts, the people themfelves appear to 
have been only different colonies of the fame Celtse or Gael*. 

The, 

* Thefe names, by the by, feem to coi.ie from two words of 
the fame fignification, viz. Co/7/, or Coille, and Gad, a wood. 
From Coille comes Collltich, (Ktvrsd), Inhabitants of the Woods. 
From Gad, in Scots Gaelic, fignilying a Withe or Twig, in 
Welfh, a Wood, come Gaidhiol [Gad-ghiohi), Gadellans (or Giade* 
Hans), Galli, and Gadent, names given to the Gaidheil, or Gael of 
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales ; all fignifying Men of the Wood 5

The name of the country, from Dunkeld to the marches of 
Badenoch, towards Dalchuiny, Atholl (or Adh-oll), is evi- 
dently from this fource. Adh fignifies happinefs, or plea- 
fantnefs, and oil, great ; great pleafantnefs. The Grampian 
mountains, too, appear to be fo called, from the word Gram- 
pla, dill retained by the Cornifh, as well as by the French, 
grimper, to climb, or mount ; but it more probably comes from 
gmaim, gloominefs, and beinn, a mountain, on account of 
the clouds that cover them. Beinn-glo, the Mountain with 
the Vail, to wit, of Clouds and Snow : Beinn-dcirg, the Red 
Mountain, on account of the red granite in it ; — Beinn-vu- 
rich, the Hill of roaring or rutting; m&amp;Dritmuachdar, thefuperi- 
or ridge, — are all equally expreflive of their origin. ——-The 
names of the rivers, too, are from the fame language. Gar- 
ry [Gath-ruith), the flight of the Dart, becaufe of its rapidity. 
Tum/nel (Taivil), fhadowy, obfcure, from its woody and rocky 
banks. Erochty, from eirigh, to rife, and ath, a river ; or ra- 
ther from oireachdas, eireachdas, an afl'embly •, this being a cen- 
trical, and yet a retired place, where forces might be collect- 
ed for an expedition (which ufe, Duncan Ravar, the chief 
of the Robertfons, is known to have made of it, in the time 
of the two Bruces ;) or to fecure women, children, and valu- 
able effects, from the enemy. In fupport of this, in the head 
of Glenerochty, is Trinafuir, or Tir-a-vuir, the third, or the 
land of the wall or caftle •, and Dail-nan-fonnoch, the Plain of 
Palifades, or Stocades. Bruir (Bru-vir) noify Water. Tilt, 
(Ttilt) Tt-alty the Warm Rivulet, from its fheltered warm

ihnuich, the Wood of Trembling, (Killicranky) from its aw- 
ful appearance. Fcnn avuic, the Land of the (Roe) Buck. 
Bo ralnich, the Ferry Booths. Loch-loch, a loch confiding of 
lochs, becaufe it is in three divifiens. Each of the rivers gives 
a name to the valley, or glen it runs through : They alfo ge- 
nerally give names to the lakes, whence they flow. 

Antiquities On the Eaft bank of the Tilt, which falls in- 
to the Garry, fouth eaft of Atholl-houfe, is Clagh-ghil-Ain- 
dreas, or the cemetery of Andrew's difciple. What the Tilt 
has left of it, is a part of a circle ; many of the bones are entire, 
but crumble to pieces, when touched. The coffins are com- 
pofed of five flags each, and feem to have been ufed, to fave 
the trouble of making wooden coffins ; or probably, to pre- 
ferve the corps from the wolves. To the fouth ward of this 
ftood Anderfmafs market, which is now held at Perth. Here 
was a large white ftone, which was the market crofs, and re- 
mained upon a little raifed circle of earth, till. Duke James's 
time. To the eaftward of the cemetery, there are the remains 
of a large Druidical cairn ; but the fmall ones have been moft 
ly carried away. About a quarter of a mile up the fame bank 
of the Tilt, is one of thofe round caftles, that are fo frequent 
in thefe countries, and which probably anfwered the purpofes 
both of forts, and of watch towers. Above half a mile ftill 
farther up, ftandsTom-a-vuir,(Tcm-a-mhuir),or the hill of the 
well, or fort; where, it is faid, theM'Intoihes of Tiriny lived of 
old. It is ftrongly fituated on a fteep bank of the riytr Tilt. 

About a mile to the eaftward of Tilt, lies Strath-groy, 
(Srath-ghruaidh, or Srath-dhruaidh,) i. e. probably, the valley 
of the Druids. About the middle of it, and not a furlong 
from the river, Mr Stewart, who farms that land, lately dug 
up a ftone, 01 about 6 feet long, above a foot broad, and half 

Vol. II. 3 O as

as thick. It flood perpendicular, all under ground, and firm 
ly propped in that pofture with fmall ftones. 

Above a furlong to the eaftward of this ftone, are two caf-« 
ties, nearly round, on the top of a pretty high ridge, above a 
gun-fhot from the high way, a few paces from each other, 
having double, and in fome places triple ditches. Before the 
gates Hand feveral obelifks, in a zig zag pofition ; probably 
for the protection of champions, that defended the entries, 
and to obftruft the enemy's accefs. Thefe feem to be of a 
later date, than the other round caftles. 

About a quarter of a mile to the weftward of the caftle3, 
and along the Garry, lies, Eeleln-an-righ y i. e. King's Ifle, 
quite level ; below the caftles are Dalruinich, i. e. ue&amp;Uruith* 
nan-each, the Plain of the Running of Horfes ; 'and Dail-ati' 
aonuich, the Plain of Gallopping, or Horfe Races. From 
the fituations and names jof thefe, it is more than probable, 
that horfe races, and perhaps other games, were celebrated 
here, particularly when the kings of Scotland came to the 
hunting. For them too, it is probable, the two caftles above- 
mentioned may have been built. 

Half a mile above the caftles, and near Clunctnore, ftill erf* 
tire, is a facrificing cairn, 60 geometrical paces in circumfe- 
rence, having feveral large flags on the top, which probably 
conftituted the altar ; and, hard by it, two obelifics, feeming- 
ly a part of a circle or temple. Above a mile N. W. of this 
cairn, on the bank of the Fender, ftands Tulc&amp;an, (i. e. the 
little hill,) another cairn, much larger than the former, and 
fo old, that the foil has, in a great meafure, covered the 
ftones. Betwixt thefe two cairns, to the weftward of Lude's 
Houfe, ran, in a S. W. direction, a line of fmall cairns. 
Whether they were a part of the great Druidical work, or the 
graves of men killed in battle, is hard to fay. The foil being- 
good, the plough has overturned moll of thefe ancient works. 

Several

Several miles to the N. E. of Tulchan, and on the north 
fide of Beinn-glo, is Lochainn, i. e. Loch-amhain, or the Ri- 
ver that is flow like a loch. It runs from Lochloch, towards 
the Tilt. Upon Lochainn, are the veftiges of the palace, in 
which the Earl of Atholl entertained King James V, his mo- 
ther, the French arabafiador, &amp;c. in a moll fumptuous man- 
ner, as is mentioned in hiftory ; and, which was burnt to the 
ground, as foon as the king left it. 

On the fouth fide of Beinn-glo, on a rifing ground, are to 
be feen the traces of a femicircular work, fronting the weft. 
A rill runs through the centre of it ; the banks of it appear to 
have been well focured by large (tones ; and, in the front, for 
a confiderable extent, there is a mofs or bog, called Moine- 
fian-gal, i. e. the Mofs of the Lowlanders, — of the ftrangers, 
or of the enemies, who are faid to have been there defeated. 
In the laft generation, one Robertfon found two pans, funk in 
this mofs, which feemed to have been very old. Capt. Wil- 
liam Robertfon of Lude, who examined this camp, thinks 
the Danes built it, in attempting to force their way, through 
the heart of the country, to their pofleflions in the Hebrides. 
A party of Baliol's friends are faid to have pafled this way, 
after having been defeated, by King Robert Bruce, at Inver- 
chadain and Dailchoifny, in Bunrannoch : But whether this 
camp is not much older, or whether they had a camp there at 
all, is uncertain. 

To the eaftward of the camp, along Glengairnog, are to be 
feen fome pieces of a road, called Rod na-banrinii, or the 
Queen's Road; by which, probably, one or more of the Queens 
ufed to go to the foreft of Atholl. On the top of the rock of 
Fonn-a-vuic, is a large round caftle, which, from its high and 
inacceflible fituation, muft have been very ftrong. 

In the N W. corner of Lochtummel, there is a fmall iflanc!, 
partly artificial, on which Duncan Ravar M'Donald, the chief 
3 02 of 



476 Statijlical Account 

of the Clan-Donnachie, or Robertfons, built a ftrong houte 
and a garden, which gave the name of Port-an-eilein, or the 
Fort of the Ifland, 10 that place. Within lefs than half a mile 
above Port-an-eilcin,'is Grenich, i. e. Grian-fha'uh, or Gr'ian- 
acha, the Field of the Sun. Here are the remains of a very 
extenfive Druidical work : A large circular wall, either a caf- 
tle, or the foundation of a very large cairn, with fmall cairns 
innumerable, on the barren ground above it, which were pro- 
bably graves. About a mile to the northward of thcfe, is a 
large cairn, that appears only to have been begun, the circum- 
ference being laid of great (tones, and a parcel of lefler ones 
thrown within it. It is probable, that it was flopped by the 
progrcfs Chriflianity then made. 

About two miles to the N. W. of this work, are, a number 
of cairns, but of a different kind ; being the cairns of the 
Suaineart men, who came to plunder Atholl, about 200 years 
ago, and were killed above Bohefpie, to a man, after having 
had their bard fhot acrofs the river, a mile above Blair, from 
whom the ford is calted Aih-ba'ird-fuahudh, to this day. It 
would feem, that, of old, the creeling cairns, or heaps of 
ftones, over the graves of the dead, was one of the ways they 
had, of fecuring them from the wolves. The cuftom remained 
till of late, not only of railing heaps, where one was buried, 
but even where one died, though buried clfewhere. Into thofc 
heaps, it was reckoned a duty on paffengers, to throw a ftone. 
Hence the proverb, " Were I dead, you would not throw a 
** ftone into my cairn that is to fay, Ycu have not fo much 
friendfhip for me. 

On the fouth fide of the hill, and north end of Lochgarry, 
lies Dail-an-fpidcily i.e. the Plain of the Hofpital. Here, in 
all probability, there was formerly a houfe of entertainment, 
to fupply the place of an inn ; and poiTibly too, fupported by 
knights, or fome religious order. There was another Jpidei/, 
at the foot of the Grampian mountains, on the Marr road. 

Dail-na-cardoch 



of Bhir-Atboll and Stroivan. 477 



Dail-na cardcch is the Dale of the Smith's Shop, or rather of 
the Iron work; Dail-tia-mcin is the Plain of the Mineral. 
Near thefe, and along the lide of the hill, down to Blair, are 
ft ill to he feen the holes, wherein they melted the iron-ore. 
At that time, the country was covered with wood of various 
kinds, efpecially of Scots fir; the roots of which are ftill dug 
up for fire-wood. 

A gun-flict above the church of Strowan, on the S.W. bank 
of the Garry, is Tcm-an-ticb-mboir, the Hill of the Great Houfe, 
a fmall fquare rifing ground, partly artificial ; and furrounded 
With a ditch, or fofit, (aid to have been raifixl by Allan Dfrip, 
one of the family of Keppoch. In the church yard of Strow- 
an, there is a large obclifk, on which a crofs is cut. At Pit- 
agown, on the well fide of the Bruir, is one large Rone (land- 
ing, and two or three lying by it, which probably formed a 
Druidical temple. On the Minigeog road, above Blair, is 
Carn-inbic Jhimi y ( vie bimij, or Lovat's Cairn, (properly the 
Cairn of the Son of Simon,) who came to plunder the coun- 
try, and fell there. 

Atholl houfe being in good repair, and well furnifiied, not- 
withstanding the high antiquity of great part of it, does not 
come properly under the prcfent articles. Suffice it, there- 
fore, to obferve, that, till the year 1747, or later, it was a- 
bout three (lories higher, than it is at prefent, and was fortifi- 
ed with many Gothic turrets and battlements, mounted with 
guns. 

Natural Curio/tties, — To the eaft of Atholl-houfe, there is 
a deep pool, with a rock in it, whence adultcrefles were of 
old thrown, fewed up in a fack, and drowned. A little above 
it, on the eaft bank, and oppofite to a curious hermitage, on 
the weft bank, and in fight of the highway, is a pretty cafcade. 
On the^veft fide of Beinn-glo, are Carn-torcy (torky) and 

Coire- 



Statijlical Account 



Coire-thorey, (horey), i. e. the hill and the hollow of boars 5 
two of the many places, that have had their names from the 
wild boars, At fome diftance from thefe, is Ccirfhiann 
(-iann) or the hollow of the army, or, of Fingal and his heroes. 
In this part of the foreft too, is Tom-na croiche, or the Gal- 
lows-hill ; and Pol-r.am-ban, or the pool into which bad wo- 
men were thrown. On Airgead-bhcann, a part of Beinn-glo, 
there are {tones, that fhine, as if they had been vitrified, and 
give it the appearance of a volcano; which probably give the 
name of Airgead-bhcann, or the filver mountain, to this pin- 
nacle of Bein-glo. On the fouth fide of Beinn-glo is a very 
remarkable cave. It is narrow at the mouth, then turns very 
wide, afterwards narrow again, and then defcends deeper, 
than ever any perfon had the courage to venture. The found 
of water is heard in it at all times ; but there is a brook, that 
can be turned into it at pleafure ; and when that is done, it is 
reported, the people of a village, at fome diftance below, hear 
the noife of water. 

There is a fall on the Garry, at the weft end of the pafs, 
where it is faid, that a good deal of fifh were formerly taken[; 
but which did not prevent the falmon from going up the river. 
Eas-teivil, or the fall of Tummel, is remarkable for a confide- 
rable height, a great weight of water, and the quantities of 
falmon formerly caught there, in wicker bafkets and with 
gaffs, by men, who hung in the face of the flippery rock, in 
ropes, made of birch withes. Very few falmon ever pafl'ed 
this fall •, but now few, or none come this length. Near a 
mile north-weft of the fall, is a cave in the face of a tremen- 
duous rock, to which there is a fingle pafTage only. In this 
cave, a party of the M'Gregors are faid to have been furprif- 
ed, when under 'perfecution ; after pare of them were killed, 
the reft climbed into a tree, that grew out of the face of the 
rock ; upon which, their purfuers cut their arms, and precipi- 
tated 



of Blair-Atholl and Strowan. 479 



tated them to the bottom. There is a considerable fall on the 
Bruir, near half a mile above the highway, which makes a ve- 
ry grand appearance, when there is a proper quantity of wa- 
ter. 

North-eafl of the fall of Bruir, i9 Elrig, i. e. Iaoth-leirg, of 
the inclofed field, the field of a multitude, or of danger. The 
meaning intended probably is, the furrounded or inclofed 
field. There are many places of this name amongft our hills. 
Their fituation is, a riling ground, an open and pretty plain 
hill around it. On this rifing ground, the king, the chieftain, 
or principal perfon, with his friends, arms, and hounds, took 
his ftation ; while his people, alfo armed, gathering the deer 
into his fight, formed a circle round them, Then the hounds 
were let loofe, the arrows let fly, and the men, who formed 
the circle, wounded and killed many of the deer, with their 
fwords, when attempting to make their efcape. It is confi- 
dently aflerted, that in Duke James's time, John Robertfon, 
Efq. of Eaftertyre, and John Stewart in Blair-Atholl, cut, 
each of them, a deer in two, by a (angle ftroke of their broad 
fwords. They were both remarkable for ftrength and activity. 

Several of their children are yet alive. South-eaft of Elerig, 

betwixt it and Blair, lies Cnig-urrard. Craig fignifies a rock, 
ard, a height, and ur, either heath or fire. It b probable, it 
was fo called, from fire, ufed in that confpicuous place, ei- 
ther for fignals, or for a religious purpofe. Glen-mairc, is 
the Glen of Horfes. The fides of it confitf. of high and fteep 
precipices. In the late Duke's time, a gftat quantity of rocks 
fell down the one fide of it, with Inch force, that fome of 
them went a good way up the oppofite fide. About the fame 
time and place, a vaft wreath of fnow fell upon a herd of deer, 
and fmothered them. This was known, from their bones be« 
ing found there, when the fnow was diilblved.

Schools. There is a parifh fchool at Blair ; the mafter of 

which, has a falary of L. 10 paid by the heritors, and 100 
merks Scots paid out of the bifhop-rents. For the reft, he 
depends upon the emoluments of the fchool, and fome parifh 
dues. There are alfo 3 charity fchools in the parifh *, to the 
mafter of one of which, the Society for Propagating Chrifti- 
an Knowledge, pay L. 10, to another L. 7, and to a third, 
L. 4, per annum. Thefe united parifhes have no benefit from 
the labours of any itinerant clergyman, or catechift; but'many, 
from other paiifhes hear divine fervice in the churches here. 

Advantages and Difadvantages Till of late, the great 

extent of hills belonging to it, was a general advantage to 
the country, with refpeft to their cattle of all kinds ; but 
much of it is now getting into the hands of a few individuals. 

The air of the country is very healthful Two veins of 

lime-ftone run through the country from N. E. to S. W. and 

a third has appeared in one place. The Duke and Mr Ro- 

bertfon of Lude, have marie cn their property. The foil 

in general is good, and when the feafons are favourable, is 
prolific. On the other hand, we have a great deal of cold 
and frofty weather, which muft be unfavourable to the growth 
of vegetables, and even of animals. On the level ground, 
near the Garry, fogs and hoar frofts are very pernicious to po- 
j tatoes, 



of Blair -AthoJl and Strowan. 481 



fatoes, peafe, and barley, nor do the oats efcape. The pa- 
rifhes are very far from the market towns ; fo that carriage is 
very expenfive, which prevents many things from being 
C«flt to market, that would otherwife be productive. It alfo 
prevents the burning of coals, though fuel is at prefent very 
troublefometoget, and is dailyjbecoming more fo.;Some kinds of 
mechanic arts are much on the decline- Since the difufe of 
arms, there is fcarcely a tolerable fmith to be met with. The 
cafe is nearly the/ame with the fhoemakers, who are likely to 
be extirpated •, becaufe, it fecms, that there are laws, that will 
not fufFer any hides to be drefTed in the country, even though 
theyfhonld pay full duty. The tanner, therefore, both buys and 
fells at his own prices ; which, joined to the diftance, leaves the 
people very ill (hod. — The being deprived of falmon is a great 

lofs to the country. It is no fmall difadvantage, to fuch as 

have any correfpondents at a diftance, that there is no poft- 
office nearer than Dunkeld. There ought to be one eftablifh- 
ed at Blair- Atholl. The people of this, and of the neighbouring 
parifhes, fuffer many inconveniencies by the want of it. 
They mud not only pay for the letters they receive, but for 
thofe they put into the port- office. And a great number of 
letters, that would be paid for, if the office were nearer, are re- 
turned to the general poft- office, becaufe thofe, to whom they 
are directed, cannot afford time to travel fo far for them, upon 
an uncertainty, and others do not chufe to advance money for 
letters to obfeure people, whom they may have difficulty to find 
out. The hurt done to the linen yarn, by the cotton trade, has 
been already remarked: And, upon the whole, it muft be allowed 
to be a great difadvantage, to any country, to be very far 
from markets, courts of law, and good towns, where proper 
education can be had. For to thefe a great part of the produce 
of the country will go, never to return ; efpecially when they 
fend no commodities thither. That the Highlands have gone

backwards, inftead of improving like other countries, fince 
their kings removed to the low countries, and thence to Lon- 
don, might be fhown by many undeniable proofs ; and the 
rich living, in diftant places, mud have the fame effect. 
Anderfmas market, the iron works, the number of forts, the 
Queen's road, the places for executing juflice, the places for 
horfe-races, &amp;c &amp;c. clearly fhew this. But thefe things fall 
more properly to be obferved, in the ftatiftical account of the 
Hebrides, and of the parifhes in the weftern coaft of Scotland, 
where thefe difadvantages muft be felt, {till more fenfibly *. 



* It muft be acknowledged, at the fame time, that formerly, 
there was much lefs fecurity for the perfons and the property of 
the people, than at prefent. Of this, a memorable inftance occurs 
in this very diftrift One of the Atholl family, (fee Leflie's Hift. 
p. 300) having taken Donald of the Ifles ; was fo elated with the 
exploit, that he put the figure of a man in chains, in his coat of arms. 
In revenge for this, the Macdonalds made an hoftile incurfion into 
this part of Perthlhire, burnt, (as tradition fays), the church of 
Blair, and carried the Earl and Couutefs of Atholl, prifoners with 
them, into the Hebrides.

(COUNTY OF ANGUS.) 

By tie Rev. Mr. Andrew Gray.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, Soil, t*fc. 

THE antient name of this parifh wa6 Caraldfton, proba- 
bly derived from a monument erected to the memo- 
ry of Carril, a hero celebrated in the poems of Offian ; fomc 
veftigesof which, (3 large ftones (landing on an 'end, aboutamile 
and a half to the eaftof the church), (till remain. It is now con- 
traded into^ Carefton. It is fituated in the county of 

Angus, 9 miles north-eaft of Forfar the county town, 4 miles 
from Brechin, and 12 from Montrofe. It lies within the 
bounds of the prefbytery of Brechin, and the fynod of Angus 
and Mearns. Its form is very nearly an oblong fquare, 3 
miles in length, and about 1 in breadth. The appearance of 
the country is beautiful, well cultivated, lying with a gentle 
flope from north to fouth. No part of it is rocky, hilly, or 

mountainous. The foil is generally deep and fertile, a* 

bout one half on a gravelly bottom, and the other half on a 
red clay, or mortar. The air is exceeding fine, free, and 

healthful. At prefent there are no prevailing diftem- 

pers •, it is faid, however, that before the ground was drain-

ed and cultivated, agues were very frequent, in fo much, that 
in the fpring, it was with difficulty the farmers could 
carry on their work. But now there is fcarcely any fuch dif- 
temper known or felt in this place. Fevers were formerly 
pretty frequent, and carried off fcveral. But they now occur 
but feldom. 

Rivers. There are two rivers which run through this 

parifh : the South-Efk, and the Norin •, both of which run 
on a gravelly bottom. The water of Norin, in particular, is 
remarkable for its purity and clearnefs. The South-Elk rifes 
to a great height, and at times overflows its banks to fuch a 
degree, that the greateft attention is requifite every year, to 
raife bulwarks, in order to prevent it from covering the adja- 
cent grounds on every fide. The Norin, though considerably 
fmaller than the Elk, frequently comes down with fuch impe- 
tuofity, that the low grounds, through which it runs, are often 
greatly hurt by it ; which obliges the tenants to ufe every pre- 
caution, to keep it within its banks. Thefe two rivers join one 
another in the fouthern part of this parilh. They have both 
their fources in the Grampian hills ■ There is no regular 
fifhing with the net in this parifh ; but there is, in the Eflc, 
plenty of falmon, falmon-trout, and burn trout taken with 
the rod ; and, in the Norin, ^very fine burn trout. 

Produce. A variety of culinary plants, &amp;c. are raifed 

in this parifh. There are likewife a vaft variety of trees, 
fuch as afh, elm, plane, birch, beech, oak, chefnut, poplar, 
lime, &amp;c. and a great number of firs of every kind. There 
are excellent fruit trees of different forts ; and fome very 
beautiful lime trees, not inferior, perhaps, to any in the if- 
land. 

Considerable numbers of black cattle, (above 400), are 

reared 



of Care/Ion.

reared every year, and alfo about 40 horfes. The value of the 
horfes may be reckoned, from L. 15 to L. 20, or L. 25 each. 
The price of cattle, when fattened, is generally from 5s to 
5s 6d. per ftone, and milk cows about the fame. Other 
kinds of black cattle, are valued in proportion to the ftate they 
are in, when purchafed, — to their age, and the particular pur- 
pofe, for which they are bDught. The weight of the black cattle, 
reared and fattened, generally runs from 1 8 to 40 ftone a 
head; and fome, 'which are highly fed, will be near 50 ftone. 
The quality of the beef is exceeding good. Very few fheep are 
bred, except for family ufe. 

Population.— —It is difficult to afcertain the ancient ftate of 
the population of this parifh, as no regular regifter was kept 
till the year 17 14. The only conjecture, that can be formed, 
refpecting the number of parifhioners, arifes from the number 
of tokens, ftruck for the ufe of communicants, in the year 
1 709, when this parifh was under the care of an Epifcopal 
clergyman, which number was 200 *. In the year 17 16, the 
firft prefbyterian minifter was fettled : And there was, at the 
fame time, a very numerous meeting of Epifcopalians, or 
Nonjurors ; which meeting was made up of the difaffec~r.ed in 
this, and the neighbouring parifhes This meeting continued 
till the year 1746, when it was entirely diflblved. It appear* 
from a note, in the feflion records, that, during the conti- 
nuance of this Epifcopal meeting, there were many parents in 
the parifh, of that perfuafion, who ne\ er applied to the lef- 
fion-clerk, to have their children's names regjftered, nor paid 
any dues to him. However, upon examining the lift of 

baptifms, 

* To double the number of tokens, would be too much, as it 
might be expected that many would come from other parifhes, to 
the facrament at Carefton. 



4 86 



Statijlical Account 



baptifms, recorded during that period, the number, at an a- 
verage, may be reckoned at leafl nine ; which, by making 
allowance for the difaffe&amp;ed, that fought no enrolment of 

heir children, will confirm the conjecture, that the number 
of perfons in the parifh was formerly greater. With refpe£t 
to the ftate of the population, for fome time paft, the number 
has rather diminifhed ; there not being, at prefent, more than 
260 perfons, young and old, of which 132 are males, and 128 
females ; whereas the return to Dr Webfter was 269 fouls. 
The average of births annually does not exceed fix. The 
average of burials may be reckoned at fix for thefe twenty 
years back ; but exactnefs here cannot be expedited, becaufe 
there are many, who die in this parifh, that are buried in o- 
ther parifhesj; and many, that die in other parifhes, are buried 
here. For thefe twenty years paft, it is fuppofed, that the 
number of marriages, on an average, does not exceed five 
annually. The number of farmers amounts only to four, re- 
fiding in the parifh ; though there are one or two, not refid- 
ing, who farm betwixt 100 and 140 acres, in this diftrift. 
The diminution of the number of farmers, is owing, to feveral 
farms being turned into one, and alfo feveral farms taken into 
the poffeflion of the proprietor, for the purpofe of improve- 
ment. The number of trades people, in this parifti, is 
very fmall; only one fhoemaker, one houfe-carpenter or 
wright, one weaver, one tailor, and one blackfmith. There 
is but one Seceder. Of Epifcopalians, there are about nine 
or ten. The diminution of the population of this parifh, is 
owing to the feveral farms, which the proprietor has in his 
own hands, being all turned into grafs ; and, as has been 
mentioned, the other farms being held by fewer hands. 
There is alfo no encouragement given here to manufac- 
turers and fmall tenants ; fo that there are, atjleaft, an hun- 
3 dred, 



•of Care/ion.

dred, or an hundred and fifty or fixty perfons, fewer in the 
parifli, than there were 50 years ago. 

Poor. The number of poor, is fluctuating. At 

prefent, they do not exceed 4 or 5. The collections and 
funds for their relief, are amply fulficient to fupply their 
wants liberally. 

Church and Stipend. The church was built in 1636, and 

has often been repaired. The (Upend will not, including the 
glebe, exceed L. 60 per annum, when victual fells at 10s per 
boll. George Skene of Skene, Efq. is patron, and the only 
heritor. lie commonly refides at Carefton. 

Farming. The number of acres, in this parifh, may be 

about 1500; above 200 of which, are planted with hard wood, 
and firs of various kinds. At an average, there are, at leaft, 
350 acres employed in raifing corn, flax, greens, cabbages, 
and turnips. The farms, in this parifh, are all divided into 
ten equal parts, the one half in tillage, under crop, and the 
other half laid down with clover and rye-grafs. The ordinary 
rotation obferved, is five years in tillage, and five in grafs. 
The firft crop, after breaking up their fields, is oats ; the fe- 
cond, barley ; the third, oats ; the fourth, turnips, potatoes, 
cabbage, and peafe and the fifth year, the field is laid down 
with barley and grafs feeds. They fow fometimes wheat, and 
flax, as interim crops ; but thefe are not reckoned in the ordi- 
nary courfe of cropping j though, it is obfervable, that the 
crop of flax is not allowed to ftand in the room of a green 
crop, which can, by no means, be omitted. The lint is 
ordinarily fown the firft crop in the rotation. 

The parilh is not only able to fupply itfelf with the necef- 
fary provifions of meal malt, butter, and cheefe, and poultry 
of all kinds, but there can be fpared from it, annually, a very 

confiderablc

Statijlical Account 



confiderable quantity of grain of all kinds ; a number of fed 
cattle for the butcher ; and fome few fed fheep. Butter and 
cheefe are alfo fold to a confiderable amount. From 60 to 
near 70 acres are annually fown with flax. The ground, in the 
pofleffion of the proprietor, is moftly in clover and rye- 
grafs, (about 20 acres excepted \) and, as it is all in-" 
clofed and fubdivided, it generally lets to graziers and others, 
at 20s, 25s, 30s, and 46s, per acre. The amount of grafs 
fields, in the proprietor's hand, and what the tenants have laid 
down in grafs , on their farms, may be reckoned at leaft feven 
or eight hundred acres. The number of acres in natural 
grafs does not exceed one hundred. Of boggy ground, there 
are not forty acres. There is no part of the parifh in com- 
mon ; and the number of acres of wafte ground does not ex- 
ceed thirty. 

Antiquities. — There are two artificial mounts in the parifh, 
about 200 yards diftant from each other, which are common- 
ly called Laws \ and tradition fays, that one of thefe mounts 
was the ufual place where courts of juftice were held, and 
judgement was given; and that the other was the place, 
where the law was put in execution, when criminals were 
capitally convicted. Others imagine, that they were places 
of obfervation, on which fires were kindled, at the approach 
of an enemy. 

School. — The fchoolmafter has a falary of L. 10 yearly, ex- 
clufive of perquifites ; and he alfo officiates as feffion-clerk, 
for which he has a fee of 20 merks Scotch. The other emo- 
luments are inconfiderable, on account of the fmall number 
of parifhioners. He has likewife a good fchool-houfe and 
garden, with about two acres of ground, at a low rent, 
from Mr Skene. The number of fcholars varies, as in other 

places 



of Carcfton.

places, feldom above thirty, and very often below 20. 
glifh, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, . 
ftronomy, are the benches taught here \ but no Latin. 

MtfcellaiteoBs OlfiTvations—Tkzre are fcvcral dffa 
in this parifh. A fcarci^oi fuel is one \ as coal, the only i 
el ufed here, cannot be got nearer thn the por. oi . 
which is 12 miles diftant ; and there, coal is fold ac a vci j high 
price, (8s and 8s 5d. per boll,) on account of the high duty laid 
on that article, at that and the other ports on the north coaft 
of thisifland. Every boll, or 72 (tones, cofts 12s. to the con- 

fumer Montrofe is alfo the neareft port for exporting 

grain, which, being a long carriage, is of conquerable di Ad- 
vantage to the farmer. Lime and marie arc the only means 

of improvement in this parifb, and thefe are both to drive a 
confiderable diftance. Good lime cannot be had nearer than 
12 miles, and marie 7 miles. There is indeed lime to be had 
nearer, but of an inferior quality. 

This parifh has alfo its advantages. The road to the pert 
of Montrofe, is very good, fmooth, and level, without the in- 
terruption of hills, and is feldom interrupted by fiorms in the 
winter time ; fo that the communication is free and open at 

all feafons. This parifh beinj; contiguous to Brechin, 

has a regular communication by port, every day of the week. In 
Brechin there is a!fo a ready market for provifions of all kinds, 
which can be fpared from this place. And, in return, may be 
had every other article, both for the neceflity and convenkney 
of families The foil being good, and the climate tem- 
perate, give the advantage of good grain, which ordinarily 
comes to full maturity, without being hurt by the early frofts, 
or blafting ftorrr.s in autumn ; fo that the farmer has the ad- 
vantage of a true crop This parifli has the advantage 

of being excellently well watered, not only from the two rivers

of ploughs will not exceed 9 or 10; fome of which are made 
for 4, and fome for 2 horfes, as occafion requires. About 20 
carts, or at moll 24, arc ufed for the purpofc of hufbandry. 

 There is no inn, or even alehoufein the parilh. 

The tenants have their leafes on very reafonable terms ; arc 
happy in their intercourfe with one another, and enjoy in a, 
confiderable degree the blcffings of focial life. </p>

within thefe 25 years, they never exceeded 60c They now 2- 
mount to 830. The increafe is owing to the tenants having 
ufe for more hands, being bufied inclofing their farms, and 
improving them with lime and marie. There are likewife a 
number of fmall pofleffions, which give great encouragement 
to population. There are no villages, nor any uninhabited 
houfcs in the parifh. At an average for the laft 10 years, 
there have been 6 marriages, 20 baptifms, and 12 deaths- 
yearly. There are only 3 heritors, none of whom

neceflary for the fupport of the inhabitants. There was no- 
thing remarkable in the ftate of the parifh, in the years 1782,

Name, Situation, Extent, SjV. 
•npHIS parifh was originally called Inch-Brayoick, or TncK- 
"r Broyock ; by which name, an ifland of 34 Scots acres, 
near the harbour of Montrofe, but within the bounds of this 
parifh, is ftill known. It is probably of Gaelic origin ; Inch- 
broyock, fignifying, in that language, the Ifland of Trouts. — 
To this day, two-thirds of the fifliing ground, around the 
ifland, go by the name of the Trout-fhot At what pe- 
riod, the parifh began to be denominated Craig, cannot now 
be afcertained. The continental part was perhaps commonly 
called Craig ; and when the place of worfhip was transferred, 
from the ifland to the continent, the whole might obtain that 
name. It was natural to give it that appellation, as the whob 
coaft, (about 4 miles in extent,) is lined with rock. It is al- 
ways to be found, by digging the ground a little way ; and, 
in many places, in appears above the furface-..

This parifh is fitnated in the prefbytery of Brechin, in the 
fynod of Angus and Mearns, and fhire of Forfar. It is be- 
tween 5 and 6 miles long, and its greateft breadth is fome- 
what more than %. To the fouth and weft it is confiderably 
elevated, being about 400 feet above the level of the fea. It 
contains, in all, 3308 : 1 : 26 acres, Scots meafure ; the whole 
of which (a few hundred acres excepted) is arable. The foil, 
is, in general, very good, and produces excellent crops. 

Rivers, High Grounds. — The Southefk, after croffing a ba- 
fon of water, about 8 or 9 miles in circumference, (which is 
filled by the tide twice every 24 hours) divides this parifh from 
that of Montrofe. It afterwards falls into the fea, at the eaft- 

crn extremity of this parifh. On the coaft, Dunninald is 

the higheft ground, Govanhill in the middle, and Pittaris hill, 
and Mount-bay to the Weft ; from all which there are very 
extenfive and pleafant profpetts- Mount-Bay was formerly 
called the King's feat, Red-caftle, in the neighbourhood, hav- 
ing formerly been a royal refidence. 

Climate, Di [cafes, Mineral Springs, &amp;c. — The air, in a Si- 
tuation fo elevated, is pure; the climace generally healthy — 
The moft common difcafes are fevers and confumptions •, there 
are fome inftances of dyfenteries, and rheumatifms ; agues arc 
very rare, and there are fome few cafes of epilepfy and of lu- 
nacy. A fingular kind of diftempcr, called the louping ague, 
has fometimes made its appearance in this parifh. The pati- 
ents, when feized, have all the appearances of madnefs ; their 
bodies are varioufly diftorted; they run, when they find an 
opportunity, with amazing fwifenefs, and over dangerous paf- 
fes ; and, when confined to the hdufe, they jump, and climb 
in an aftonifhing manner, till their ftrength be exhaufted. —

There is a fpring in Roflie, ftrongly impregnated with iron ; 
which is drank, and, it is faid, with good effett, by perfons 
of relaxed habits. 

Tides and Fi/beries. Thecourfeof the tide, on thiscoaft, is 

north and fouth, the flood coming from the north. In 

this parifh, there are two pretty large timing villages, Ferry- 
den and Ufan ; the firft, contains about 38 families, and the 
other 20; all of whom are fifhermen, or perfons connected 
with them. Thofe of Ferryclen employ fix boats, 4 men to 
each boat ; and, in the fuminer feafon, 3 barks for the coal 
trade. The fifhermen of Ufan have 3 boats, and 6 men to 
each boat. Laft war, about 24 men from thefe villages, and 
the reft of the parifh, ferved on board his Majefly's navy, and 

a few in the army. The fifh caught on the coaft are cod, 

ling, haddocks, fkate, flounders, and turbot. There is alfo 
great abundance of mufcles, lobfters, and crabs. The com- 
mon price of white fifh here, may be calculated at 3 farthings 
per pound. The falmon fifhings on the Southefk, belonging 
to two proprietors in this parifh, were formerly very produc- 
tive. Thofe of Roffie, fome feafons, yielded 10,000 falmon, 
and grilfes; but, fince the year 1781, they have fallen oft" 
greatly. The barrel of falmon fold, 20 years ago, for about 
3 guineas, and the frefh falmon for 2S. per Dutch ftone; but, 

of late, the prices have increafed to near double. A few 

years ago, a quantity of oyfters were brought from the Firth 
of Forth, and put down in a place where they were likely to 
breed. But, there is fome reafon to fufpe£t, though the point 
is not yet afcertained, that oyfters cannot thrive in the neigh- 
bourhood of mufcles.

Mr Scot of Rome, were the firft who began to inclofe their 
property, in 1730. Thorn hedges, and hedge-row trees were 
firft tried ; but this mode being found tedious and expenfive* 
earthen fencer, with furze or whin* on the top, were adopt- 
ed. But thefe, after a trial of many years, being found in- 
fufficient, the gentlemen have begun to inclofe with ftone 
dykes, or walls \ and, if they perfevere, with the fame fpirit 
with which they have begun, (which there is reafon to believe 
will be the cafe,) in a few years, the whole fields of the parifh 
will be inclofed in that manaer. 

Roads.—— "Formerly, the king's high-way, which partes 
through this parirti, was very infufficient, and, in the winter, 
feafon, almoft impaJable. But, about the year 1750, by the 
application of the ftatute labour, an excellent road betwixt 
Ferryden and Arbroath, was begun, and in a few years com- 
pleted. This year, a new turnpike road, a little to the weft 
of the other, through this parifti, was begun, (by a tract more 
circuitous indeed, but deemed to be more level, and commo- 
dious for travellers,) and will foon be finifhed. By means of 
the ftatute labour, now generally commuted, wc begin to en- 
joy good private roads, of which we ftoodin great need. 

Wood- — About the beginning of this century, there was lit- 
tle wood in this corner ; but within thefe 70 or 80 years, a 
good deal has been planted, and the parifh may now be faid to 
be precty well wooded ; particularly in the wafte part of it, 
where a great many acres have been inclofed and planted. 

Agriculture About 60 years ago, Meflirs. Scotts began 

gradually to make confiderable improvements in the cultiva- 
tion of their lands. They had plenty of lime within the pa- 
rifh; 



of Craig. 499 

riflr, but feveral years elapfed, before tlie reft of tbe country 
began to follow their example. Of late, however, {till far- 
ther improvements have been made, particularly by a quicker 
rotation of green crops : The lands are kept in better heart, 
and produce more plentiful crops than formerly. 

Pricf of Land, at w/ Rent Rather better than a century a- 

go, Patrick Scott, Efq. bought, (with the exception of two 
fmall pieces of property,) the whole parifh, for about L. 10,000 
Iterling; and, within thefe 8 years, that property, viz. Rof- 
lie, including Craig, and Dunninald, exclufive of the eftate of 

Ufan, was fold for L. 64,000. About the year 1730, 

the average rent of land here, was about 4s 6d. whereas all 
the farms, let within thefe few years, give from L. 1 : 5 to 

L. I : to, per acre. The valued rent of the whole parifh, 15 

L. 4275 : 4 : 1 Scots. The real rent, including the produce of 
lime, and of falmon fiflnngs, is above L. 4000 fterling. 

Services.— -The meagre look, the tattered garment, the 
wretched hovel, the ill-cultivated and unproductive field, with 
the other miferable effects of feudal tyranny, and the fure ef- 
fects of perfonal fervices, are curfes, from which this part of 
the country, has long fince been generally delivered. The on- 
ly relict of this kind here, is, the thirhgeto a mill, to which 
the tenants, upon one of the cftates are fubjected i but which 
is foon to be removed. 

Ferry Boats.— By the regifter of the kirk-feflion here, it ap- 
pears, that, upon the fabbath day, efpecially in time of pub- 
lic worlhip, no boats were permitted to crofs at Ferryden. — 
"Whereas now, they are more employed on that, than on any 
other day of the week ;— the liberty of modern times having 
affumed, or being allowed, a flacker rein.

Cdjllcs and Forts — There were, in this parifh, two caflles, 
that of Black Jack on the fea fhore; formerly the refirience of 
the family of Dunninald, of which, by the falling of the rock, 
there are harldly any remains-, and the caflle of Craig, which 
was demolifhed not many years ago. At the extremity of the 
parifh; to the eaft, where the Southeflc falls into the fea,~tbere 
are the remains of an earthen fort, in the form of a fquare ; 
each fide of which was about 50 feet ; the walls 16 feet thick, 
and, formerly, as high, or higher than a man's head. With- 
in, there was a houfe, for the purpofe of affording fhelter to 
the men, and holding ftores or ammunition. Without the 
fquare, and facing the mouth of the river, there was a breaft- 
work of earth, where cannon had been planted, to defend the 
entrance of the river. Tradition reports, that it had been 
made ufe of in Oliver Cromwell's time but whether erected 
by him, or in more antient times, cannot now be afcertained. 
At this fort, fome cannon were placed, folate as the 1745. — 
About 20 years ago, the town of Montrofe built, within this 
fquare, a quadrangular tower, between 20 and 30 feet high, 
for a land- mark, to direct veffels at fea ; and, along the fouth 
fide of the river, at a fmall diftance from one another, two co- 
nical towers, or pillars, were lately erected by that town, for 
directing veffels, when to take the river, with fafety. 

Population. There has been a regular and progreffive in- 

creafe, in the population of this parifli, for thefe many years 
paft. About a century ago, the number of fouls was about 
676. It rofe, in 1738 to 806. The report to Dr Webfter, 
jn 1755, was 935. In 1768, the number was 1264, and, on 
the 24th of Februar y, 1791, it came to 1 314. Of which there

Poor.— The average amount of collections for the poor, from the 
year 1653 to 1758, inclufive, was about 2s iod. per week. In 
the year 1760, when the prefent incumbent was fettled, there 
was only about L. 83 laid out at intereft. The collections have 
fince increafed confiderably, and, for fome years paft, have 

been, at a medium, 12s weekly.- Some years ago, the 

funds received, from Alexander Arbuthnot, Efq. Commifli- 
oner of the cuftoms at Edinburgh, an additicn of L.100, and 
lately, from a proprietor of this parifli, L. 50. Thefe fums, 
together with former favings, amount now to L. 200, pro- 
perly fecured at an intereft of 5 per cent.

The number of weekly penfioners is 12. The weekly pen- 
ton is 12s pd. befides confiderable fums 'given from time to 
time, to other poor, not upon the lift, and the purchafe of 
coals for all the pooz annually. It may here be remarked, 
that, be fides the private benefaftions of refiding heritors to 
the poor, they derive much benefit from the circumftance of 
fuch families being ef our own communion, and atcending the 
cftablifhed church, which has generally been the cafe, for a 
century paft. During 40 years, and upwards, no poor have 
Iiad occafion cx been allowed to beg ; the parifh being both a- 
ble and willing to maintain its own poor. Many however, 
are apt to give liberally to ftrolling vagrants, or fturdy beggars, 
who in.'eft this diftritr. and the neighbourhood ; an evil|fcvere- 
ly felt, and which ftinds much in need of an effectual remedy. 

Church, Patronage, \jtc. — The patrons are the matters of 
the New College of St. Andrevs. The manfc was built about 
the year 1748 ; the offices in the year 1774 •, and an excellent 
garden wall, in 178?. The manfe is inconveniently fituated ; 
being diftant from the church about a mile. The ftipend is 
L. 42 : 4 : 5A» ^ith 3 chaldefs yi&amp;ual, half meal, and half 
bear. The glebe confifts of 7 acres, including houfes and 
garden. The church wa» repaired, and almoft new built, in 
the year 1 760. There were, in popifh times, 4 burial places 
"in the parifh. The principal one, at prefent, is in the ifland 
©f Inchbrayock The inhabitants belong, with very few ex- 
ceptions, to the cftablifhed church. In 178?, there were on- 
ly 6 Seceders, and 16 Epifcopalians. 

School. .Very lately, a fubftantial and?clegant houfe was 

built for the fchoolmafter ; and his yearly falary was raifed, 
within thefe few years, from L. 8 to L. 20. ; the fchool fees, 
and other perquifites, may amonnt to L. 20 more. Adjoin- 
ing 



*/ Craig. 



ing to his houfe, is a fchool-houfe, fufficiently large and com- 
modious, with a fmall garden. 

Manufactures In the manufacturing line,thereis nothing 

carried on here to any great extent. The reafons may be, 
that the great object of purfuit, in this diftrift, is agricul- 
ture, and that the fituation of the parifli, much derated and 
remote from rivers, does not furnilh the water that would be 
requifite for extenfive bleachfields, and for the operations of 
mills. There are, however, 36 weavers including apprenti- 
ces, 6 carpenters, 4 mafons, 4 fmiths, with a few fervants 
of each clafs ; 2 flatcrs ; and one baker. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. — The good and juftly celebrated. 
Bifhop Leighton was of the family of Ufan, in this parifli. 
Only one man, with his family, has emigrated from the dif- 
tricl, for thefe fome years pad:. The caufe of this was, not 
opprefliou, nor want of employment, nor poverty unaided ; 
(for none of thefe evils are felt here,) but the fpirit, which 
prevailed at the time, and the delufive hope of gaining much 

with little labour. There are, in this parifli, in wheat, 

oats, barley, peafe, flax, turnips, potatoes, and cabbages, a- 
bout 2700 acres. Number of horfes, 1 83 ; of black cattle, 
804; of flieep, 1013. — There are 6 houfes for vending ale 
andipirits, in one of which only ale is brewed. The practice 
of fmuggling foreign fpirits, from which this coaft is not yet 
free, is productive of much lofs to the public, and of many 
evils to individuals. 



Advantages and Difadv ant ages. —One advantage arifes from 
the nearnefs of the parifli to Montrofe, where the inhabitants 
canpurchale what they want, and fell what they have to dif- 
pofe of, with little lofs of time ; and, when the bridge is 
2 built 



504 Statiftical Account 

built over the Southefk, (with the near profpect of which we 
are now flattered,) the communication will be much eafier, 

and attended with many additional conveniences- Another 

advantage is the eafy accefs which the farmers have to lime. 
At Bodden, in this parifh, there is a lime-work carried on to 
great extent ; and, to that fpot, all the improvements in huf- 
bandry, made in this country, is, in a great meafure owing. 
The greateft difadvantage, is the high price of coals, owing to 
the heavy duty, which takes place here. This tax is much 
complained of, as evidently partial, impolitic, and unreafon- 
able. A fmall duty laid at the pit, would yield much more to 
government than the prefent one ; and the burden being laid 
equally upon all, would be much more eafily borne, and could 
fcarcely bs objected to, on any juft and reafonable grounds.

NUMBER XLV. 
PARISH OF <name ref="NA">KIRKDEN</name>, 

(COUNTY OF ANGUS.) 
By the Rev. Mr. MiLLiGAN.</head> 



<p>Name, Situation, Extent, &amp;c. 
HT'HE parifh has two names, Kirkden, alias Idvie. The 
firft only is in common ufe ; and is evidently derived 
from the fituation of the kirk and manfe, which are built in a 
den. It derives its other name from the barony of Idvie. — 
It is about 5 Englifh miles in length, and the broadeft part of 
it does not exceed 2. About the middle, for near a mile, it is 
very narrow. — Kirkden lies in the prefbytery of Arbroath, 
in the fynod of Angus and Mearns, and in the county of An- 
gus or Forfar. The foil is various. About 1 200 acres are 
dry kindly land, mixed with fmall ftones, called by the far- 
mers, a beachy foil. This part is, in general, fooneft fit for 
the feed in the fpring ; and the crop upon it is fooneft ripe in 
autumn. About 900 acres are deep dry land, and the bed is 
till. The remainder is a cold clay bed, and is naturally wet 
and fpungy, but has been greatly improved by draining.

Air, Climate y Difeafes The air is commonly clear and 

falubrious, excepting fometimes in the evening, about the end 
of April, or the beginning of May, when the wind is wefter- 
]y. In the pleafanteft days, and fometimes for feveral days 
together, we fee the fog rifing on the German Ocean, about 
3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon j and, even when wc enjoy the 
moft delightful funfhine, we know, that, in an hour or two, 
we fhall be involved in darbiefs y that may almoft be felt. So 
fiowly does the damp approach, that it is often fome hours be- 
fore it reach us, after we fee it a-coming. In general, how- 
ever, the inhabitants are remarkably healthy. About 25 or 
30 years ago, the ague, efpecially in the fpring, was fo ge- 
neral, that many farmers found it difficult to fow and harrow 
their lands, in the properfcafon, owing to their fervants being fo 
much afflicled with it. At prefent, this difeafe is little known 
in this parifh, or in the neighbourhood. This is perhaps 
owing to the draining of the grounds, the great change 
that has taken place in the mode of living, drefs, &amp;c. Every 
year, feveral children die of the fmall pox, the prejudices a- 
gainft inoculation being ftill very great. In vain, the patrio- 
tic Mr Dempfter provided, laft feafon, an able phyfician and 
proper medicines : Though inoculation, by thefe means, 
might have been got gratis, hardly one accepted the generous 
©iTer. 

Rivers mid Fiji}. The Finny and Lunan, both of which 

rife in the parifh of Forfar, either pafs along, or partly inter- 
red! the parifh of Kirkden. There is excellent burn- trout in 
both, which are, however, every year, much deftroyed with 
the watering of flax, either in the rivulets themfelves, or in 
places from whence the deadly ftreams run into them. Eels 
are alfo caught in the feafon ; and fea fifh are brought from 
hi coaft in confiderable quantities. 

ManufaElures..

Mannfaclures. There is hardly a houfe in the parifh, 

where one or more women arc not employed in fpinning yarn, 
for the Ofnaburgh weavers. Many millions of yards of Ofna- 
burgh cloth, are, every year made in this county, of which 
this parifh manufactures its proportion. The women all fpin 
with both hands and a good fpinner can earn 3s, or 3s o"d, 
per week. Girls of 13, or 14 years of age, earn 2s, and ma- 
ny of them 2s 6d a week ; and they reckon their board only 
about is 6d. For this reafon, many, inftead of going to fer- 
vice, continue with their parents and friends, merely for the 
purpofe of fpinning, as being a more proGtable employment, 
and, in which they enjoy more liberty. But there are many, 
who do not like to be fo clofely confined to fpinning, and 
therefore go to fervice, where only a part of their time h 
fpent at the wheel. Weavers are interfperfed, at fmall dif- 
tances, all over the country ; and moft of them give out flax, 
and pay the current price for fpinning it. Much of the flax 
grows at home ; but great quantities are alfo brought from 
abroad. Till lately, the manufacturers of this neighbourhood 
went to Forfar or Arbroath, for the ftamping and faic of their 
webs ; but now there is a market, every fortnight, for thefe 
purpofes, at the neighbouring village of Letham. 

Population. On the laft day of October 1790, the num- 
ber of perfons living in fche parifh of Kirkden, properly pa- 
rifhioners, were 727 ; of whom there were 359 males, and 
368 females

Thomas Lyal, Efq. of Gardyn, the oldeft man now living 
in the parifh, was 85 years old, the 9th of October, 1790, 
and is yet a healthy man. A labouring man of this parifh died 
laft year, aged 92 years, and a few days. The return to 
Dr Webfter of the population of Kirkden, in 1755, was 563. 
The inhabitants have therefore encrtafed 160. The caufe 
feems to be the flourifliing ftate of manufactures. 

The parifh regifters being very inaccurately kept, no cer- 
tain conclufions can be drawn from them. From 1780, to 
1787, inclufive, the number of marriages were about 71, and 
of burials, 66. 

Divifion of the Inhabitants.— — In this parifh there are 133 
families; 17 of which, confift, but of two perfons each; and 
2 or 3 folitary individuals- Of the above there are 4 refiding 
heritors, 33 farmers, (perfons who have no other occupation) 
26 weavers, 5 wrights, 4 taylors, 2 mafons, 2 cadgers, 
(fifh-carriers,) 4 blackfmiths, 3 fhoemakers, 6 millers, 2 
creamers, (perfons who go through the parifh, and neigh- 
bourhood, and buy butter, hens, eggs, &amp;c. moftly for the 
Dundee market,) and 19 labourers. The above are all heads 
of families. There are about 60 labouring fervants, male and 
female ; but almofc all the females are chiefly employed in 
fpinning; and there are 9 or 10 houfehold fervants in the he- 
ritors 



of K'trkden. 



ritors families. Many families have no occafion to hire 
fervants, having a fuflicient number of children to perform 
their work. And the faucinefs of fingle fervants makes other* 
engagecottagers, whofe family ties make them more dependant 
and humble. Thus evil produces good, and pride prevents depo- 
pulation. Each of theft? married labourers has a houfe and 
yard; a cow maintained fummer and winter ; 52 (tones of 
meal ; the carriage of their coals and other fuel ; and com- 
monly, fome ground allowed them for lint : and fome of them 
have L. 5, fome L. 6, and fome of them E. 7 in money. Be- 
fides thefe fervants, reapers are engaged for harveft ; a good 
female fhearerat about L. 1, and a male at about L. 1 : 6. All 
the inhabitants are of the cftablifhed religion, except the re- 
fiding heritors, and 1 or 2 in their families, in all about a' 
dozen, who belong to the church of England j and about 
21 Antiburgher Seceders, including children. 

Genera/ Character The inhabitants of tin's parifh, 

with very few exceptions, are an induftrious, civilized, ami 
contented people. No perfon has been banifhed. from it, nor 
been guilty of murder, fuicide, or any atrocious crime, wiih- 
in the prefent century ; if we except thofe, who, from miftak- 
en loyalty, followed the Pretender, in 1745. 

Chriftmas is held as a great fcfiival in this neighbourhood". 
On that day " the fervant is free from his mailer," and goes 
about vifiting his friends and acquaintance The poortft muft 
have beef or mutton on the table, and what they call a dinner 
with their friends. Manyamufe thcmfelves with various di- 
versions, particularly with fhooting for prizes, called here 
wad-JJjooti/ig. And many do but little bufinefs all the Chrift- 
mas week ; the evening of almoft every day being Ipont in a- 
mufement. All the lower claffes of the people Hill obfeive 
the old ftile. 

Church. 



Statiftical Account 



Church. The church was built in the year 1749 •, and 

the manfe was repaired, and the office houfes rebuilt in 1783. 
The living confifts of 16 bolls of meal, 6 bolls of bear, and 
850 rnerks Scots, (L. 47 : 4 : 5-A)j in money, and 6 acres of 

land ; in all about L. 66 fterling a year. The Crown is 

patron. 

School. - • -The fchoolmafter's falary is 100 merles Scots, 
(L. 5:11: Itt) with fome perquifites which do not exceed 
L. 3 per annum. There are few fcholars. 

Poor. The number of poor at prefent, who receive occa- 

fional alms, is 10; but all of them have property, and 
earn moft of their fubfiftence, except 3 old perfons. They 
live in houfes near their children, who are in a thriving con- 
dition. They receive out of the poors funds, the price of a 
boll of meal, one after another, as they require it, on applying to 
the elders, any Sunday after fermon, and alfo money to buy 
fuel in the feafon. Orphan children are boarded at the rate of 
L. 4 fterling per annum. No perfon, properly belonging to 
this parifh, is in the habit of ftrolling about as a mendicant. 
Indeed, in this manufacturing country, fuch as are able to 
go about and beg, are generally fit, unlefs they have infant 
children, to earn their bread at home, the women by fpinning, 
and the men by filling pirns, (rolling up yarn upon lake reeds, 
cut in fmall pieces for the fhuttle). By experience, we have 
found it to be a great faving of our poors funds, to aid thofe 
who are finking into poverty, before they fall too low. To 
fupport the, poor we have the weekly collections and feat- rents 
of a loft, in the church, erected out of the poors money, in 
all about L. 15 or L. 16 per annum \ and L. 156 lent out upon 
intereflr, at the rate of 4f per cent. This fund, for thefe 16 
years paft, has been fully adequate to the demands of the poor, 

without 



of Kirkden. 



without any application to the landholders ; who, about 20 
years ago, were in the ufe of contributing annually a certain 
fum for their relief. The poor are not only well provided 
for, but very well fatisfied with the attention that is paid them. 

Divifwn and Rent of Lands. The whole extent of the pa- 

rifh is nearly 3500 acres ; about 3000 of which are arable, and 
the remainder planted, or moor, not yet improved. It is di- 
vided among 6 proprietors, 4 of whom reGde in it. Only a- 
bout a half of the parifh is yet inclofad •, but the inclofing pro- 
ceeds apace ; the better fort of farmers being very fenfible of 
the great advantage which may be derived from it. 

There arc about a dozen of perfons, including 3 proprie- 
tors, who farm from about 30 to 150 acres each. The 
reft of the parifh is divided into fmaller portions, from 36 
down to 6 acres ; for there are very few families in the parifh, 
who have not one, or more cows, not excepting thofe who 

live partly on charity. The rent of moll farms, lately 

let in leafe, taking the good and bad land of the farm, at an a- 
verage, is 15s. One large inclofed farm, however, lately let 

at L. 1 the acre. The late leafes are, in general, for 19 

years. For a crop of lint land, fome pay L. 5, and fome (this 
year) L. 6: 3, the acre. Thofe who let the land, plough and 
harrow it, and carry the flax to and from the watering.—— 
Perfonal fervices, thofe badges of antient flavery, are ftill part- 
ly continued, though lighter than formerly, and now limited. 
Several of the tenants, however, are altogether freed from 
them. It is a pretty common thing, to pay a certain number 
of kain fowls. Some of the tenants are obliged to give a 
draught of one, or more horfes, for a fpecified number of 
miles, if required ; or to fend one or more carts for coals to 
xhz proprietor, and to give, perhaps, a day of all their reapers,

in harvcft, upon receiving notice the evening before. The e- 
vil confequences, which muft refult from this, are obvious. 

Mode of Cultivation There are 44 ploughs in the parifh 

all drawn by horfes; but many of them hardly deferve the 
flame of ploughs ; for feveral of thofe, who rent about 12 or 
15 acres of land, keep only one horfe, and, joining with ano- 
ther in the fame ftate, with thefe two, commonly but indiffe- 
rent, horfes, they cultivate both farms. A tenant with two 
ploughs, and 8 ftrong horfes, is fuppofed able to manage a 
farm of 200 acres to great perfection. It is true, there are 
often but two horfes in the plough j and he ftirs his barley 
ground fometimcs, with one horfe only, while the other hor- 
fes are doing other parts of the farm work. The mode 

of farming is various, according as the tenants, who have old 
kafes, are (killed in hufbandry, or otherwife, or according to 
the tafte, and knowledge of the proprietor, by whom, in the late 
leafes, they are often tied down to a certain rotation of crops. 
In general, however, about half of the land is in grain of va- 
rious kinds, and the other half fown with grafs feeds. What- 
ever number of crops, in grain, are taken, the land lies as long 
in grafs. The following is a common rotation: After grafs, 
1 ft, oats, 2.dly, turnips, peafe, potatoes, or lint-, 3dly, barley 
and grafs feeds, keeping it in grafs three years. 

Stock and Produce. — The ftock in this parifh principally con- 
fifls of black cattle and horfes : there are almoft no hogs, and 
not above 150 fheep. In regard to produce, after fupplying 
the parifh itfelf, large quantities of meal are annually fold in 
the neighbouring towns; and about 1200 bolla of barley, 
(3 t,6oo ftone) r are annually exported. Through the whole 
fummer, butter and cheefe are weekly carried to the different 
markets around us.

2W.--Thisparifh,and the neighbourhood, bring moft: of their 
fuel from Arbroath. The cart load of coals, (72 (tones), colts 
generally 65 8d. befides carriage ; yet this is our cheapeft, as 
well as b, j lt fuel , for there is little peat in this neighbourhood, 
and none in this parifh. 

Roads and Bridges — The roads have, till laft year, been 
made by the {tat ute labour, which was, long ago, found alto- 
gether Insufficient, for making and keeping them in good re- 
pair. The labour of one parifh was often carried out of it, 
to make a road in another, while the roads, within the parifh 
itfelf, were exceedingly bad. 

In 1790, an act of parliament was obtained, to raife mo- 
ney by turnpikes, for making certain county roads, therein 
laid down. In this act, the ftatute labour is converted int.T 
money, at the rate of L 1 : 4, fterling, on the L. 100 Scots of 
valued rent, to be raifed yearly, till the parifh roads are made. 
By this act, no money can be levkd in one parifh, to make 
the roads of another. 

The turnpike act met with considerable oppofition, before 
it was carried in the county ; as moft improvements do in their 
infancy; and there are ftill grumblers: But the gentlemen 
now feem all agreed ; and the moft refpertable farmers ac- 
knowledge, that turnpikes muft be a great advantage in this 
county, where roads were formerly, at no time good, and, in 
winter, were fo deep, as to be almofc entirely unpaffable. 

Antiquities. — A plain in the parifh of Kirkden, between the 
Finny and theLunan, feems, in days of yore, to have been often 
a field of blood. There is an obelifk in it •, and many Roman 
urns, with bones in them, have, at different times, been dug 
t-p. The obelifk is niched into a large ftone. There are on 
it, lbme imperfect figures of horfes, &amp;c. It is fuppofed by

fome, to have been erected, upon the defeat of the Danes by 
Malcolm II. about the fame time with the crofs at Camifton, 
in the parifh of Monikie, mentioned by Buchanan. Near this 
obelifk, there was a green hillock, confiding of fand and gra- 
vel, which was cut away 16 years ago, in ftraighting the road 
in which fome graves were found. The bones in them were by 
no means of a larger fize, than thofe belonging to perfons in 
modern times. 

In this parifh there are two artificial conical mounts, called 
Laws : the law of the barony of Idvie, and that of Gardyne. 
The laft is now covered with fir trees. The gallows flood up- 
on the top of the Law. Thomas Lyal, Efq. was told by Da- 
vid Philip, fometime ago, a tenant in the parifh, that he (Da- 
vid Philip) faw two Highlandmen taken in this parifh, with 
ftolen cattle, and immediately judged, condemned, and hang- 
ed, on the Law of Gardyne. The Law of Idvie has alfo an 
aperture on the tcp, where probably the gallows ftood, or was 
occafionally erected, in feudal times 

The caftle of Gardyne was built in 1568. It is firm and 
entire. An addition, to make it a more commodious dwelling, 
has been added in later times. The caftle is romantically fi- 
tuated, on the brink of a precipice, at the bottom of which, 
there is a beautiful plantation of thriving trees, through which 
there runs, a purling ftream, of the purefl water. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — There is a mineral well in the 
.parifh, which has cured fwellings and fores of the feet and 
legs, merely by wafhing, after the applications of feveral 
phyficians had proved ineffeaual Potatoes are begin- 
ning to be more ufed in the towns ; but, in this parifh, they 
arc feldom eat by the labourers, even by thofe on public cha- 
rity, excepting in the months of Odober, November, and 
December.— — — None, belonging to this parifli, ftroll a-

bout begging ; y«t many Randies (fturdy vagrants) infeft this 
country, from the neighbouring towns, and the Highlands; 
who, from an undifcerning humanity, and fometimes, per- 
haps, from timidity, are but too much encouraged ■ 

A very great change, in the appearance of the people has taken 
place, within thefe few years. About i 5 years ago, all the 
men fervants wore coarfe home-manufaclured cloth and bon- 
nets. There were then feldom three men's hats feen at church, 
on a Sunday. Now, moft of the men fervants wear, on Sun- 
day, good Englifh cloth, (at leaft what goes by that name) ; 
and there is hardly a bonnet to be feen in church. — —Many 
of the lower claftes of females ft ill continue to cover their 
heads with the plaid in church : But feveral of them wear 
cloaks and fdk hats, and begin to drefs after the manner of 

thofe in the more fouthern counties of Scotland. Within 

the Lft 10 years, about 9 or 10 cottages have become ruinous; 
but a greater number, and houfes of a better fort, have, in 
that time, been built.

<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 

ALL that part of the weft of Scotland, which lies hctwccn 
the rivers, Dee and Don, wub originally termed Marr. 
The three great divifions of this extenfive region, are, Brae- 
Marr, Cro-Marr, and Mid-Marr. The fir ft denotes the higheft 
part of the country ; the fecond, a lower and more cultivated 
diftricl: thelaft had its name, probably from its centrical fitu- 
ation, in refpect to the two rivers, each of which is diftant a- 

bout 6 miles from the church The parifh is fituated in 

the prefbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, in the county and 
fynod of Aberdeen. It is about 15 miles diftant from that ci- 
ty. Its length, from eaft to weft, is about 6f miles ; and its 
breadth, from north to fouth, between 5 and 6 miles in fome 
parts, exclufive of that part of the hill of Fare, which belongs 
to the parifh, but which is uninhabited.

Total 6077 acres, of which nearly three- fifths, is in 
cultivation ; fo that, including that part of the hill of Fare, 
belonging to Midmar, which contains 464 acres of mofs, and 
3239 of muir, the contents of the whole parifh is about 9780 
acres. 

Hills, FoJJlh, Mineral Springs, &amp;c - — In Mid-marr, the 

only eminence, that deferves mention, is the hill of Fare, 
which forms its fouthern boundary. The bafe of this moun- 
tain is about 17 miles in circumference; and its height 1793 
feet above the level of the fea. On that fide, which is con- 
tiguous to the caftle of Mid-Marr, there is a thriving plantation 
of fir trees, of almoft every fpecies. The interior part con- 
tains, in its mofs, an invaluable article cf fuel to the neigh- 
bouring inhabitants. It affords alfo excellent pafture, for 
numerous flocks of fheep; and produces mutton of a very 
fuperior flavour. No place, in this pare of the country, fo 
n^ar the coaft, abounds perhaps fo much, in muir-fowl, 
hares, and other game, which find, at the fame time, both 
feed and flicker, in the luxuriant heath, which overfpreads its 

furface.

furf.'.ce. Foxes indeed are, both numerous and mifchie- 
vous •, and are expelled ,from their hiding places with much 

difficulty. 

Several chalybeate fprings are found here, which, in fcro- 
phulous and fcorbutic habits, have been found highly benefici- 
al. Thcfe fprings are diftinguifhed at the fountain-head, 
from the common element, by a brown vifcous fubftance, ei- 
ther adhering to the edge of the rill, or floating on its furface. 
They may be traced, in the fame manner, at confiderable dif- 
tance from their fources, by the brown tincture of their chan- 
nel, and of the earth on each fide of it. The water takes a 
blue cad upon mixing fpirits with it, and is rendered black, 
by a fmall infufion of ftrong tea, as is the cafe of the well- 
known medical fpring of Peterhead.— The chief foffil is 

granite, of which, an excellent kind, capable of receiving a 
very beautiful polifh, is found in different parts of the pa- 
rim. 

In the middle of this eminence is the vale of Corricbie, 
well known as the fcene of a battle, wherein the contending 
parties were headed by the Marquis of Huntly, and the Earl of 
Murray. Huntly fell in this engagement, in which his for- 
ces were routed by thofe of his antagonift, the general of the 
unfortunate Mary. A fmall pofleflion, on the north fide of the 
hill retains, at this day, the name of Craig-Hume in memory 
of pne of that family, who was flain in that battle, and is in- 
ferred in die neighbourhood. It is proper alfo to obferve here, 
that the name of&amp;teea'j, Cha:r,i$ given to an excavation,- 1 know 
not whether natural or artificial, on the fide of a rock, near 
this valley. Here Mary is faid to have fat, while returning 
fouthwards from Aberdeen, to view the fcene of the recent 
engagement. In the neighbourhood of this fpot, a remarkable 
echo is occafioned by the contiguity of three fmall eminences, 
from two of which, and the adjoining wood, the laft accents 

or

of the voice are thrice reverberated, in a tone uncommonly 
fhrill and diftincl. The principal remains of antiquity in this 
parifh, are three Druidical fanes, of which, one, near the 
new church, is remarkably large ; and an artificial mount, 
of confiderable magnitude, which is now a part of the glebe*. 
This mount is obvioufly a work of art. A ditch or trench, 
that is caft round it, is now covered with grals, from the 
bottom of which to the fummit, the perpendicular height is 
about 30 feet. The acclivity is gentle at the entrance, but 
fteep in every other part. The middle part of the fummit 
contains a cavity, with a fmall circular rifing in its centre. 
Here, tradition reports, that criminals were tried, and juftice 
adminillered. Upon the muir of Dalharick, in the north- 
weft part of the parifh, a battle is faid to have been fought, 
between Wallace and Gumming, wherein a perfon of diftinq- 
tion fell, of the name of Douglas: A tumulus, or cairn, marks 
the place, in the field, where his body was interred ; and a 
brook that runs through it, retains, at this day, the name of 
Douglas' Burn. 

Solly Climate, and Productions . The ground rifes gradual- 
ly from the eaft to the fouth weft and weft extremity of this 
parifh, of which the foil towards die weft, extending two 
miles from the church, is, in general marfhy; and the crops 
are late in ripening. In the north and eaft divifions, on the 

contrary 

* Of Druidical fanes, arid what the ancients have related, con- 
cerning the manners and cuftoms of the celebrated order, from 
whom that appellation is derived, forne account is given, in a 
poem, entitled The Fane of the Drulls, publifhed by Murray, 
London ; to which the reader is referred for particulars on thrs 
curious fubjed^.

contrary, the mould is commonly good dry earth, on a deep 
clayeytbottom, the country level, and the harvtft as early as in 
molt parts of the county. The principal crops of grain, are 
barley, oats, and peafe; of which the two lad fpecies are fown 
in March, and reaped in September; and the hrft, fown about 
the beginning of May, is commonly reaped towards the end 
of Auguft. But thefe circumftances are rendered precarious, 
by the nature of the foil, as well as by the uncertainty of the 
feafons. In general, the harveft is concluded, about a month 
fooner in the north than in the fouth-weft part of the parifh. 
Potatoes may be confidered as a part of the principal annual 
produce of the land. Turnip fowing begins to be pra£lifed 
by the farmers. Some rich hay crops are raifed, near the re- 
iidence of the heritors of Mid Marr and Shiels, as well as on 
fome of the principal farms. Flax is raifed only for private 
ufe. In general, it may be obferved, that the produce of the 
parifh confulerably exceeds the confumption, fo as to admit 
of an annual export. 

The caufes, that concur chiefly in obftrucYing improvement 
in agriculture, in this part of the kingdom, are, the prejudi- 
ces of the farmers in behalf of old eftablifhed practices ; the 
fhort leafes granted by heritors •, and certain fervices, which 
tenants are bound, in many inftances, to perform, under the 
penalty of forfeiting their pofleflions. Thefe caufes ftrengthen 
e ach other, by mutual co-operation. The prejudice of a far- 
mer, in behalf of ancient practice, (alwiys powerful in an un- 
enlightened mind,) may be counteracted, during the courfe of 
a long leafe, when he has lcifure to look about him, and to 
make trial of experiments, of which he has ellimated the pro- 
fit, as well as remarked the effect. On the contrary, he, 
whofe leafe muft expire within a few years, will be attached, 
perhaps infenfibly, to the practice and modes of his predecef- 
fors, from the impofhbility of imitating a method, of whifh 

lie

he might have been brought to approve. In this manner, he 
is induced to juftify a mode of cultivation, which, whether 
right or wrong, he mujl carry into execution. The effect of 
fervices, when rigoroufly exacted, in difpiriting the farmer, 
and in rendering him indolent, and even indifferent to his 
mod important occupations, mull be obvious to any perfon. 
It ought to be remarked here, in juftice to the proprietors* 
that different tenants of this parifli have been long refident on, 
their pofleffions, particularly in the eftates of Mid-Marr and 
Sheils. A facl, fomewhat fingular, is, that the farm of 
Bankhead, in the latter eftate, has been occupied, during 
three centuries, by a race of farmers of the name of Fowler : 
Thefe, with the Tytlers of Corfinday, (of whom different fa- 
milies and well known names are defcended,) have poflefled 
the fame farms during many generations, and beenefteemed at 
all times for their integrity and the propriety of their conduct. 

Rent, Heritors, Farmers. — The valued rent of Mid-Marr 
amounts to L. 2387 Scots ; the real rent, as nearly as can be 
conjectured, is from L. 1000 to L. 1 ico Sterling. The far- 
mers arc in number 35 ; who pay, for their beft arable land, 
about 2os-, and, at an average, about 15s per acre, for all their 
infield ground. They draw from their fubtenants, for fuch 
land, from 20 to 25 s per acre, themfelves ploughing it. There 
are here two reliding heritors. The public road and crofs 
roads, in one pnrt of the parifh, are in good order ; in ano- 
ther, both of late have been much negle£ted, as the principal 
heritor does not re fide in it. The public road is kept up by 
ftatute labour, to which the males, from 15 to 60 years of 
age, are called out, twice a year, at Mid-fummer, and after 
harveft. An exemption from perfonal fervice may be obtain- 
ed, by the payment of is 6d a year. But there are few in- 
ftances, wherein the individual does not either work himfelf,

or put a fufficient man in his place. Statute labour firft took 
place, in this diftri£t, about the year 1752. 

Cattle, Sheep, Hujbandry, JJtenJils, Carriages, tsfc. There 

are in Midmar, according to a pretty exact eftimate, 132 
horfes, 525 black cattle, and about 1955 (beep, 59 ploughs, 
and 91 carts. No waggons are neceffary here, andnoreliding 
heritor has a carriage. 

Healihincfs, Longevity, Stature, Population, cfsV.— — The 
healthinefs, and longevity of the inhabitants, is the fureft 
proof of the purity of the air of this region. One of thefe, 
Robert Mackay, died, fome years ago, at the reputed age of 
103 ; another, a refpedbable tenant, named John Mackay, 
aged 90, died about the fame time ; and, of two women, na- 
tives of the parifli, one died in her 90th, the other in her 
97th year. The antient population cannot be exactly afcertain- 
ed. On the whole it has rather decreafed. The numberof inha- 
bitants at prefent is 945 ; between which, and the return to 
Dr Webfter, of 979, in the year 1755, the difference however, 
is inconfiderable. During 10 years, from 1720 to 1730, the 
annual average of marriages was 10, and the births 26 ; from 
1780 to 1790, though the average marriages were the fame, 
the births were fallen to 20. One principal caufe of this dif- 
ference will be found in the change, that has lately taken place, 
in the manners of the people. In the lower clafles, the ex- 
pence of drefs, of convivial meeting^, and other appendages 
of luxury, have over-balanced the increafe of wages, and the 
profit of trade. Among the better order of farmers, an emu- 
lation takes place in thefe, as wtll as in other correfponding 
articles. Young men were enabled, during the forraer 
period to many early, by having pradtifed an oeconomy, 

which is now exploded by the fafhion of the times. 

Young

Young women, in the fame manner, acquired a comi 
petent dowry in thofe days, at an early feafon of life, by at- 
tention to this great circumfhnce ; and time was not wafted 
by either, in idle and expenfive gratifications. Marriagee, 
therefore, which, about 50 or 60 years ago, were contract- 
ed in early youth, and produced a numerous offspring, are 
now poftponed to a later feafon, and are of confequence 
lefs productive. The following is an exact numeration of

Many of the men exceed 6 feet in ftature ; from 5 feet 8 
inches to 6 feet, may be the ordinary height of the men, and 
3 feet 4 inches, to 5 feet 8 inches, that of the women. One 
inftance of extraordinary mufcular vigour occurs, in Peter 
Thomfon, a man now broken down by age, who has been 
known to perform feats of ftrength, to which three ordinary 
men would fcarcely have been equal.

ther necefTary tradefmen, fufficient for the exigencies of the 
parifh, fome of whom are excellent workmen : there are like-; 
wife a few fbopkeepers. They live together in fcattered villa- 
ges, in houfes thatched with ftraw ; thofe of the principal 
farmers are not incommodious, in which they entertain with 
becoming hofpitality. The near neighbourhood of Aberdeen 
renders larger towns lefs neceflary. The lower ranks are fo- 
ber and decent in their manners, intelligent and tractable; and, 
with their wealthier neighbours, abundantly ready to contri- 
bute, according to their ability, to the relief of the neceffitous 
poor. The whole parifh are members of the eftablifhed church, 
two families of Seceders excepted. The chief manufacture, 
is that of ftockings, which are knit by the women, by which 
they can earn 2s. a week. The only language fpoken here, is 
that dialect of the Englifh, common in the north of Scotland. 

Patron, Stipend, Church, Prejbytery. Mid-Mar, is a vice, 

patronage, to which Sir William Forbes prefents twice, and 
the Crown once alternately. The annual flipend, glebe in- 
cluded, is from L. 80 to L. 90, varying according to the price 
of grain. The former parifh of Kinnairney being now united 
to Mid-Marr, and Cluny, its glebe is equally divided between 
the minifters of thefe two parifhes. A new church was built 
in 1787 ; the work is well executed, but the fide-walls are not 
of a proportionate height. It would otherwife have been neat 
and commodious. The minifter of this, with thofe of the 
neighbouring parifhes of Cluny and Echt, are fubjected to a 
confiderable local inconvenience, from being included in the 
extenfive range of the Prefbytery of Kincardine O'Neil ; the 
road from thefe parifties to the Prefbytery feat, and higher 
parts of the prefbytery, being, by the hill of Fare, at all times 
unpleafant, and, in winter, commonly impaffable, thefe mi- 
nifters are often precluded from fupplying occafional vacan- 
cies 



of Mid-Nlarr.

cies, and from attending the meetings of Prefbytery, even on 
the moft urgent occafions. 

In confequence of a legacy of L. 150, from the late Robert 
Harvey, Efq. of Grenada, the capital ftock belonging to the 

poor, amounts to L.217. 'The emoluments of the fchool 

are about L. 15 per aanum. 

Mifcellatieons Remarks. Mr William Mefton, profeffor 

of philofophy in the Marifchal college of Aberdeen, a man of 
confiderable genius, was a native of the parifh of Mid-Marr. 
He was the author of a fmall collection of poems, of which 
a 6th edition was publifhed at ^Edinburgh, in 1767. Some ac- 
count of this author is prefixed to his poems, to which thofe 
who defire to know the particulars of an unfortunate and c- 
ventful life, are referred. The burlefque of thefe pieces is 
not diffimilar to that of the celebrated author of Hudibras. 
That this gentleman did not rife to excellence, in the line 
which nature had chalked out to him, we may afcribe, with- 
out injuftice, to the two great foes of every nobler effort of 
human genius, indigence and dependence. Mr Mefton's father 
was a blackfmith, much refpecled for his knowledge and fa- 
gacity. To the memory of this and his other parent, our 
author ereded a monument, in the parifh churchyard. This 
circumftance, omitted in the account of his life, ought to have 
been mentioned, not merely to commemorate that inftance of 
filial piety ; but alfo on account of the pure and claflical ftile 
in which the epitaph is compofed. 

Conclufwn. The change, that has taken place, on the 

general manners of the inhabitants of this diftricT:, as on thofe 
perhaps of all others in its neighbourhood, during the laft half 
of the prefent century, is marked by very ftriking circum- 
ftances. Old perfons complain of this alteration, in the au- 
thor's 



516 %

thor's opinion, without reafon. They cenfure indifcriminatc- 
ly every deviation from ancient practice, not as being culpa- 
ble, but new ; and they reprobate, with unmerited appella- 
tions, certain modes of conduct, which indicate only an ad- 
vanced ftate of civilization. Thus, changes that ate preferr- 
ed by fafhion, and the manners of the times, are termed ex- 
travagance and affectation ; converfation fomewhat enlarged, 
or any attempt to deviate, in difcourfe, from their own bar- 
barous phrzfeology, are imitations of the talk and manners of 
gentlemen ; an advance towards improvement, by any new 
mode of agriculture, is an innovation that cannot be praftifed 
fucccfbfully ; and the demand of written fecurity for money, 
is an indication of diftruft, that is inconfiftent with ancient 
fimplicity and confidence, when individuals demanded no o- 
ther fecurity for fmall fums, than a verbal promife of pay- 
ment. Thefe changes have their origin, partly in the larger 
and more diverfified intercourfe of focitrty, and partly in the 
more univerfal diffufion of property, of which men are natu- 
rally rendered more careful, as they become more fenfible of its 
value, and are benefited by thofe advantages, of which it placeth 
them in pofTeffion. Perhaps, indeed, progTefs in agriculture 
ha3 not kept pace with other branches of improvement. Yet, 
if the latter fhall go forward, in the fucceeding, as in the 
prefent century, fome correfponding advancement muft be 
made on the former; as men will find, in the melioration of 
their farms, the only refource, whereby expence, that will 
become unavoidable, can be fupported.</p>

gie ; the origin and etymology of which are unknown. 
Kinkell retains the old name, which is derived from the Gae- 
lic, and fignifies the head, or principal church. It obtained this 
name, becaufe other fix inferior parifhes belonged totheparfon- 
age of Kinkell. In 1754, the Lords Commifiioners for the 
plantation of kirks, disjoined about one third part of the pa- 
rifh of Kinkell, and annexed it to Kintore. The other two 
thirds of Kinkell, they annexed to Keith-hall, or Montkeg- 
gie: And. they appointed, that thefe pariihes, in all time com- 
ing, fhou'.d be called, the United Parifhes of Keith-hall and 
Kinkell. This is the authority for the modern name. 

Thefe pariihes are fituated in the prefbytery of Garioch, 
and in the fynod and county of Aberdeen.— They contain 
1 between

between 10,000 and 11,000 acres, the greater part of which 
has been meafured. They extend rather more than 6 Englifh 
miles in length. Their greateft breadth is 5 ; but in fome 
places they are confiderably narrower. 

Thefe parifhes are hilly, but not mountainous. The foil 
varies confiderably. The weftern part, having a fertile foilj 
produces good crops : But the eaftern is, in general, very 
unfruitful. This is partly owing to its expofure to the E. the 
N. and N. E. partly to the poornefs of the foil, and coldnefs 
of the fubfoil, and no doubt, alfo partly to its elevation, many 
of the fields being 350 feet above the level of the fea.— — — 
The air, on the whole, is reckoned falubrious ; but not equal- 
ly fo, being moifi: and unhealthy near the marfhy grounds. — 
Inflammatory fevers, fometimes attended with putrid fymp- 
toms, prevail in the eaftern divifion ; and of late, flow ner- 
vous fevers, which are more tedious than fatal ; and the mea- 
lies and fmall pox occafionally make their appearance. The 
rheumatifm and nervous complaints, commonly called hyfte- 
rics, are not unfrequent ; the firft among the active, after 
violent exercife, or fudden tranfitions from heat to cold \ the 
fecond among the fedentary, whofe fole occupation is the 
knitting of ftockings. The fcarlatina anginalis, or fcarlet fe- 
ver, with a fore throat, was fatal to many, in 1783. It was 
probably occafioned by the badnefs of their provifions. The 
fchrophula, or king's evil, is in a few families : Yet it does 
not prevent the marriages of thofe, who are known to be af- 
fected with that dreadful difeafe. 

Rivers There are two rivers, the Don and theTJry.— - 

The Don produces falmon. The Ury has none, except in the 
fpawning feafon. Pike, eel, and trout are found in both. 
The channel of the Don is full of large rocks at Stony wood, a- 
kout 5 miles diftant from Aberdeen, which would make it ex- 
tremely 



of Keith-Hall and Kinkell. 529 



h-emtly difficult to render it navigable. But if a canal were 
carried along the fide of that river, for 3 miles, a navigation 

.might be carried, to Inverury With little expen.ce the Ury 

could be rendered navigable, as its fall, for 12 miles, count- 
ing its windings, does not probably exceed 30 feet. Both 
thefe river* are apt to overflow the adjacent grounds. The 
greateft inundation was in 1768. Another, not much lefs, 
took place in J 774. In 1789, though the flood was not near- 
ly fo great, the Don overflowed its banks eleven times during 
the harveft feafon. 

Ecclefiaflical State. The Earl of Kintore is patron.— 

The ftipend is nearly 89 bolls of meal andbear, and L. 43 : 1 3 : 5 
in money. — The church and manfe were built in 1771 and 
1772, at a place in the centre of the diftric"t, called Legate, fo 
named, becaufe the Pope's Legate ftaid there all night, (at a 
fmall chapel, which ftill retains the name of Monk's Hillock,) 
the night before the great battle of Harlaw : as Legate's den, 
in the chapel of Garioch, was the place, where he in vain at- 
tempted to reconcile the contending parties. 

In this diftridl: there are 38 Quakers, 3 Seceders, 2 Metho- 
difts, and 10 Epifcopalians. The reft are of the eftablifhed 
church. 

Population The population of thefe parifhes has de- 

creafed fir.ee the year 1750, and even fince the prefent incum- 
bent was fettled. The return to Dr Webfter, was 828 fouls 
in Keith-Hall, and 429 in Kinkell, two thirds of which, or 
?.36", being united to Keith-Hall, would make the total popula- 
tion of the diftricl, at that time, about 1 1 14 fouls •, whereas 
from 1778 to 1782, there were only 900 perfons of all ages, 
viz. 239 in Kinkell, and 67a in Keith-Ha!l : and at Whit- 
fnndav 1782, the farmers in Keith-Hall parifh having entered 
Vol. II. 3 X into 



Statijtical Account 



into new leafcs, and mofs having become very fcarce, the 
tenants were reftricted to a certain number of fubtenants ; 
fo that, in winter 1784, the miniftcr's parifh lift was reduced 
to exactly 797 pcrfons. In 179s it rofe to 816 •, and at Whit- 
funday 1791, to 838. Of laft this number, 232 were below 5 
76 between 15 and 20; 134 between 20 and 30; 129 from 
30 to 40 ; 88 from 40 to 50 ; 75 from 50 to 60 ; 52 from 
60 to 70 ; 36 from 70 to 80 ; 13 from 80 to 90 ; and 3 from 
90 to 100. Among thefe, there are only two refiding heritors, 
the Earl of Kintore, and Major General Gordon, of Balbi- 
than. 3 1 farmers pay L. 10, or more of rent ; 113 are fmall 
farmers, or fubtenants, and 64 have only a houfe, and fome- 
timesa fmall garden, fubfdting chiefly by knitting ftockings. 
Of the fmall farmers and fubtenants, 4 are blackfmiths, 6 
houfe-carpenters, or cart-wrights, 3 taylors, 5 fhoemakers, 
and 2 weavers. There are only 3 non-refiding proprie- 
tors. 

Proportion of the Sexes. The number of the males and fe- 
males is exactly equal. Before the Earl of Kintore came to re- 
fide in thefe parifhes, there were generally 6 or 8 more males 
than females. (The number of maid-fervants in great houfes, 
exceeds, for the molt part, that of men-fervanta. In farm- 
houfes the reverfe holds true). By infpecting the regifter of 
baptifms it appears, that out of 2025 births, 1025 were males, 
and 1000 were females. Confequently the proportion of 
males to females, is exactly as 41 to 40 ; only more males re- 
move to Aberdeen, or go abroad, which renders the numbers, 
at home fo equal. 

Slate of the Poor. — The number of families on the poors - 
roll has varied from 18, its prefent number, to 30, befides

who get occafional fupplies. In 1782 there were about 50^ 
families, or 220 perfons of all ages, who received afliftance 
either from the poors funds, or from the bounty of parliament. In 
theeafterndivifionof thepariih, then inhabited by about5oo per- 
fons, there was not grain to prefervc 1 go alive. Above 2 chal- 
ders of meal ware received in a donation from the public, and 3 
chalder6 were fold for only 10s per boll, (or 20s per fack). 
All the money the feffion had, was diftributed among the poor j 
and L. 10 were borrowed on a fmall property btlonging to 
them in the borough of Inverury. Some of the parifliioners 
put money into the minifter's hands, free of intereft fcr 1 8 
months, to purchafe grain ; and the farmers, who had no mo- 
ney, fent, in their turn, horfes and carts gratis, to Aberdeen, 
for peafe, bear, oats, and coarfe flour. The price of grain 
was kept low here, compared with many other parifhes ; — 
and, in this diftrict, no foreftallers made any profit. Th« 
debt then contracted by the parifh, was only paid oiTm 1790. 
At prefent the poor get annually about L. 18; of which L. 10 
is the amount of the ordinary collections ; from L. 5 to L. 7, is 
received at the adminiftration of the facrament ; and L. 2 : 5 
of land rent from property in Inverury, befides what is 
drawn for the ufe of the mort-cloths, and for penalties. 

BLtik-Cattle, Horfes, and Shefp. — The number of black cat- 
tle at Whitfunday 179c, in this diftric"t, was 1038: their value, 
as nearly as could be computed at that time, was L. 3733. 
The number of horfes was 204: their probable value L. 1400; 
The number of fheep 1 844 : their probable value, L. 483. 
The aggregate value of all, L. 5616. This is about 5 years free 
rent, or 4i years grofs rent of this diftricl ; or nearly one fifth 
part of the value ofthe landed property of the pariflies of Keith- 
Hall and Kinkell. But though their price is high at prefent, their 
number and intrin£c value has of late much decreafed. Above 
3 4» 



532 Statiftical Account 

40 years ago, by the bell accounts that can be procured, there 
were at leaft double the number of black cattle, in this diftritl, 
and more than 5 fheep where there are 2 at prefent. And in a 
few years hence, it is probable, there will not be one half of 
the prefent number. The number of horfes alone has increaf- 
ed, fmce black cattle came to be lefs ufed in the plow. In 
1778, there were 26 oxen ploughs, each plough confifting of 
10 or 12 oxen, befides other fmall ploughs. At prefent there 
are only 8 ploughs, which have 10 oxen in the plough* The 
number of young cattle has alio decreafed fincei782 and 1783. 
At that time many farmers were obliged to fell all off, or 
great part of their oxen ; and thay have not yet been able to 
fupply their place, though they raife as many young ones as 
they can, to pay their rents and flock their farms. Almoft all 
the ftock of black cattle are reared in the diftri£r. itfelf. A- 
bout 20 horfes are of the weft country, or Irifh breed ; the 
reft are home-bred, and of the kind called Galloways. They 
are lighter, live longer, are more hardy, and eafier kept than 
the other ; and feem to retain a little of the original blood. A 
great number of them have been carried to the fouthern coun- 
ties within thefe 8 years paft. 

ProduSt. Oats, bear, barley, peafc, turnips, potatoes, 

a few carrots, and a good many greens and cabbages, are the 
principal productions of the diftri£b. There may be 300® acres 
in oats of different kinds; near 300 in barley ; 100 in clover, 
and rye-grafs ; and from 36 to 40 acres in turnips. The an • 
cient hufbandry, within thefe 10 or 18 years, is beginning to 
wear out; — and, with proper encouragement, the farmers; 
would inclofe and improve their farms. The diftridr, fupplie*

Mode of Cultivation. The ancient divifion of tlie land 

was into infield, outfield, and fauchs. The infield was dunged, 
every 3 years, for bear •, and the two crops that followed bear 
were oats invariably. The outfield was kept five years in 
natural graft ; and, after being tathed by the farmer's cattle, 
who were folded or penned in it, during the fummer, it bore 
5 fucceffive crops of oats. The faucli3, after being 5 years in 
natural grafs, got a tingle plowing, (hence they were called ore 
fur ley), the land continuing without a crop for one year, and 
then bearing four crops of oats, without any dung. Thefpecies 
of oats ufed for this lall, and partly for the outfield, is called 
fmall oats, hairy oats, or fhiaeks. They yield from five pecks, 
to half a boll of meal. And are meafurtd by handwaving, i. c. 
they are ftrokedby the hand about 4 inches above the top of 
the firlot. They raife a great deal of fodder, or forage ; and 
exhauft the ground more than any other crop. 

Since the introduction of turnips, the farmers make it a ge- 
neral rule, not to take more than one, and never more than two 
crops of oats in fucceffion, in their infield grounds. But in re r 
gard to the outfields and fauchs, when they manure them with 
lime, without taking a turnip crop, the wretched fyftem of j 
fucceffive crops of oats is ftill continued. Two or three far- 
mers begin to think of a rotation of crops ; without fixing, 
however, on any regular rotation. The old Scottifh plough, 
the Yorklhire, and a mixture of Scots and Engliih ploughs, 
are ufed in this diftricT:. 

Forejl and Fruit Trees There is a confiderable number 

of large afh and plane, and a lew good Scots firs, all above 
60 years old, near the houfes of Keith-hall and Balbithan ; 
but too little, of any other kind of wood, in this diftri£t. 
What there is, cenfifts of elm, black cherry, larix, fpruce and 
Scots pine. A few apple trees, and fome pears and cher- 
ries 



534 



Stailjlical Account 



ties are found in the gardens : And, in 1 762, Lord Marifchaf 
caufed plant feveral hundreds of geans or black cherries, 
which have anfwered very well. 

Farm-houfes and Cottages Thefe are generally built of 

ftone and mortar, fometimes with ftones, without any ce- 
ment ; and are covered with turf. Within thefe five years, a 
▼ery few of them have been ftob-thatched, or covered with a 
deep coat of ftraw, — and fnecked or harled with lime. None 
of the walls are built with lime ; nor are any of their roofs co- 
Tered- either with tiles or ftates. — Yet they arc much better, 
than they were, before they got new leafts. They are to get 
allowance for their houfes, at the end of the leafe ; but they 
get nothing, or next to nothing, allowed them, in the firft in- 
ftance ; as is the practice in mod of the improved counties. 
The whole dead inventory, or value of the houLs, belonging 
to the heritors, does not much exceed L. 150, in both thefe 
parifnes. 

Fuel. — The fuel made ufe of is of various kinds. Peats, 
from the Burreldal? mofs, conftitutc the principal fuel 
in Keith-hall. Turf from the moors, and broom, and 
furze or whins, are ufed in Kinkell, where they have little 
mofs, and that of very bad quality. A few coals are ufed, in 
the eftate of Kinmuck, by the farmers : But only a few ; for 
they are very dear. A boll of coals, of 36 ftone, cofts from 
4s to 5s at Aberdeen ; and the carriage, where carts are hired, 
about half that fum ; fo that, every pound of coal cofts more 
than half a farthing —Till the t.ix on coals be taken off, or e- 
qualized over the kingdom, the farmers, in the north of Scot- 
land, will never fucceed in agriculture ; becaufe the whole 
fummer is fpent in collecting fuel to their heritors, and them- 
lelves. Every pofleflbr of a plough of land, rauft caft, and

carry home to the heritor's houfe, and build, a leet of peats, 
in the principal eftatein this diftruffc. — This colls him a week's 
labour of his carts, and about ios for digging and building 
them. Peats are not fold publicly, but are frequently ftolen, 
and fometimes fold privately, to thofe who have no mofs. 
All the mofles are under bad management, and muft foon be 
exhaufted. 

Manure— —The dung of animals, here called mad, and 
peat-afhes, are the principal manures. Within thefe twelve 
years, lime has been driven, in confiderable quantities, from 
Aberdeen, a diftance of 14 Englifh miles. Some flacked lime 
has alfo been driven, from fome lime kilns, in the parifhes of 
Udny, New Machar, and Old Machar. It is a very expen- 
five manure. At the average expence of lime and car- 
riage, every boll of fhell-lime, (Aberdeen meafure, holding 
130 Scotch pint6,) cofts 5s •, and an acre of ground will re- 
quire 16 bolls, — or L. 4, for lime,— and the carriage from 
Aberdeen. Of late years, the price of lime has fallen confi- 
derably at Aberdeen ; but it is ftill very dear. 

Rent and Size of Farms. — The largeft farms contain about 
250 acres, including pafture grounds, and rent from L.60, 
to L. 65 a year. Thefe are called two ploughs. One plough, 
near the river, rents about L. 35; and, in the eaft diviiion, 
from L. 20 to L. 25. In fmall parcels, good land is rented at 
20s per acre. The farmers are generally charged 12s an acre, 
for their infield land : And their outfields and fauchs are ra- 
ted at from 3s to ros. The. firft, (that which is let at 2s,) is 
really the deareft, in the way they manage it, viz. plowing 
•without manure, and taking four or five crops of oats). In 
general, good gtounds are valued very cheaply by the heritors, 

and 



33 6 Statiftical Account 

and land-meafurers but the bad lands are by far too dearly 
rented. As land is worth no more than what it will produce, 
after clearing all charges, the infields, valued at 12s, are bet- 
ter worth 1 8s, than the outfields, eflimated at 6s, are worth 
4s ; and than thofe, rated at 3s, are worth 1 s, if kept in crops, or 
is 6d the acre, if kept, as they ought to be, in grafs, and ufed 
as fheep's pafture. Accordingly, thofe farmers are mofl 
thriving, who have moft good ground, even though the pro- 
prietors think they have a great rent paid them. In general, 
the whole lands, in this diftricr., are worth the whole rent 
charged from all the tenants : But that rent is, in fome cafes, 
very ill proportioned among the different farmers; and both 
the cheapeft and deareft lands in the county, are to be found 
in this diftri£l. At the fame time, the great rife in the wages of 
fervants, day-labourers, and expence of harvefting, and of 
farm utenfils, is more generally complained of, by the far- 
mers, than the rife of their rents. 

Prov/Jiotis The price of provifions varies considerably in 

difFerent.feafons. Good oat meal, at an average of 20 years, 
las been iod. farm meal, 9c!. a peck, of 8 Amfterdam, or 
Scots troy pounds. Malt is. to is 4d. a peck, Aberdeen mea- 
fure, or 20s to 265. the Winchefter quarter. (In the whole 
diftricl of Garioch, the firm meal, made of fmalloats, which 
both heritors and minilters mull accept from the farmers, is 
10 per cent, worfe, tlian the oat meal fold in the market at A- 
berdeen). Butter fells, in this diitrict, from 6d. to 8d. the 
pound, of 26 avoirdupoife ounces, which is the weight of the 
pound at Old Meldrum, the neareft market town. At Aber- 
deen, the pound of butter is 28 ounces •, and, in other places, 
20, 2, and 24 ounces, all in the fame county. Cheefe fells 
atjs. the (lone of 26 lb. In general, the neceffaries of life

are from one third to one half dearer, and articles of luxury- 
more than double, within thefe 40 years*. 

Expends 

* If we inquire into the proportion, between the prefent and 
ancient prices of both the neceffaries and luxuries of life, the in- 
quiry is involved in many intricacies, which, perhaps, no one writ- 
er has fufficiently attended to. We ought not only to diitinguifh, 
between the quantity of filver in a nominal pound, from the time 
that a pound of filver was a real pound weight, down to the time 
when it was reduced, in Scotland, to lefs than the value of one 
third-part of an ounce of filver, or 3 ' 5 part of its original weight, 
but we muft alfo confider, how much of pure filver, and how much 
alloy, were in a pound of coined filver, at different periods. Then 
we have to confider, how far this money went, in purchafi.ig 
articles of luxury, and how far in purchafmg the neceffaries of life. 
It farther deferves to be confidered, that, fince the difcovery of 
America, the value of gold and filver, as articles of commerce, has 
fallen, it is fuppofed, one third part ; and that this fall is indepen- 
dent of every other caufe, except the increafed quantity of thefe 
metals. 

After thefe remarks, made with a view of preventing miftakes, 
both in giving and receiving the accounts of the price of provifions 
in Scotland, the following fele&amp;ion of articles is fubmitted. In 
1438, oat meal fold in Aberdeen at 4s Scots per boll. The 
pound Scots at that time, was equal to L. I : 13 Sterling, if the 
filver had the fame quantity of alloy, which coined filver has at 
prefent. The boll of meal, therefore, was above 6s and 7d Sterling. 
But on account of the great quantity of alloy, it would not much 
exceed 5s. Yet at that period, this certainly was a high price for oat 
meal. Wheat coft 7s Scots or 1 is 6d Sterling per boll. In 1576, 
the converlion for the Bi'hop of Aberdeen's rents, when not paid 
in kind, was L. 1 Scots for wheat, worth at that time only 34 
Sterling, from Scottilh money being fo much changed in its value.

Expsnces of a common Labourer's Family. — The expence of a 
labourer, and his mode of living, are very different, according 
as he has a cow and an acre of land, or only a houfe and final] 
garden. In the fifft cafe, a peck of bear meal is mixed with 
Vo or three pecks of oat meal for bread ; and a man and his 
wife, with 3 or 4 children, will live tolerably well, with milk, 

and 



And oat meal was converted at 10s Scots, or is 6d Sterling. Thug 
the price of provifions was really much cheaper, in 1576 than in 
1438, though the nominal value was higher. In 1591, at the valua- 
tion of the effects, and confirming of the teftamentof Mrs Catherine 
Grant, wheat was valued at L. 3 Scots, or 7s and Sd Sterling. 
Only three years before that period, viz. in 1588, there was a 
famine, and oat meal fold for L. 18. Scots, or L. 2 : 6 : F 
Sterling per boll. In regard to the expence of cloaths, it appears, 
from the records of the City of Aberdeen, (from which all the 
Statements in this note are taken) that the Town Council of 
Aberdeen gave Manns or Magnus Cobbar, 2od or J sand 8d 
Scots, in 1498, to buy a coat for ringing his bell once a week. 
This coat to the bell man muft have been coarfe, yet it certainly 
was cheap, as 2od Scots at that time were equal to only 9d Ster- 
ling. In regard to the price of candles, tallowj in 153 1, was- 6r 
S'cots, or is and I id Sterling per Stone. With refpeel: to beef and 
mutton, a mart ox was valued, in the Birtrop of Aberdeen's rental 
at L. 1 : 10 Scots, or 4s and 6d Sterling ; equal to the converted 
price of 3 bolls of oat meal. This, no doubt was very cheap ; but 
the beef was probably indifferent. A fhecp in 1507, at the higheft, 
fold in Aberdeen for 2s and 8d Scots, or is and 3d Sterling. Ih 
1576 it was converted for 5s Scots or yd Sterling Only 40 years 
ago, the farmers in this diftrift fold an old ox, at the end of harveft, 
for a guinea, or 25 s, and never above 30s. Little meat was then- 
ufed in Aberdeen, compared with what is made ufe of at prefent, 
there was little demand from England, and no turnips, at ieaft i* 
this diftri£t, for feeding old oxen.

and a peck of mixed meal, at an average, to each perfon. But 
for brofe, a difh much ufed, they keep fome of their oatmeal 
unmixed. A man and his wife, without children, need 2 
pecks of oat- meal, and half a peck of bear meal, if they have 
a cow. Where they have no cow, they ufe from half a 
peck to 2 pecks of malt weekly, according to the number of the 
family, and the nature of the man's employment. In general, 
the day-labourers are in much better circumftances, than thofe 
who have large crofts •, and good mechanics can afford to live 
better, than the farmers in this diftrict. The greateft difficul- 
ty they experience, is that of getting their fmall pieces of land 
plowed, as ploughs are very fcarce. 

Manufactures. — The knitting of (lockings, is the principal 
manufacture of this diftrict. It is carried on by almoft all the 
women, and by many boys and old men. Different manu- 
facturers, from Aberdeen bring out wool, and give to the 
people, from iod. to 2s. a pair for working it. A woman will 
make from 3d, to 3^ a day, and do fome little things about 
her houfe, at the fame time. Or fhe can work at her Mock- 
ing, while feeding her cows in the baulks, or patches of 
grafs between the ridges^ which are not uncommon in this 
diftrict. On the whole, however, this employment is too fe- 

dentary, and gives too little exercife for the body Since 

the introduction of loom-ftockings, the knitting or netting of 
llockings with wires, has been on the decline ; and, as the 
Germans are our great rivals in this manufacture, and the 
price of labour is cheap there, a peace with Germany always 
reduces greatly the price of this commodity. At prefent, the 
price is low •, and, as the principal manufacturers mull give 
from 10 to 12 months credit to Dutch merchants, this branch 
of commerce is falling off, and muft decline more and more,

And, as the fheep were formerly much more numerous than

bour, belonged to the country people, this was incomparably 
a better manufacture, than the knitting of {lockings, from 
coarfe Englifh wool. It was loft by bad workmanfhip. A 
{lamp-office for this woolen manufacture, would have faved a 
valuable branch of commerce. Very little linen is made, and 
ftill lefs flax grows in this diftrict. The flocking manu- 
factory brings In from L. 450 to L. 600 a year, according to 

the price of {lockings, and the deamefs of provifions . 

In 1782 and 1783, the average price of {lockings was below is.' 
for manufacturing, each pair. But provifions were fo dear, 
that the people wrought inceffantly ; and, by the beft accounts, 
1 8,000 pair of {lockings were made yearly, at that time, in 
this diftrict. 

Carriages, Carts, Zzfc There is only one carriage kept in 

this diftrict. There are 63 double carts, of which about 40 
are pretty good there are 40 {ingle carts, moft of which are 
very bad. Thirty-five years ago, there was but one cart in the 
parifh of Keith Hall ; and the dung was carried on horfes 
backs in creels ; the men filled the creels, and the women led 
the horfes. No woman is now employed in this fervile work. 
But the women are thought to be lefs healthy and vigorous, 
fmce they were confined to the knitting of {lockings. Some 

better manufacture may be eftablifhed. Within thefe 20 

years, the whole clothing of the inhabitants was raifed and 
manufactured in the diftrict, or in the neighbourhood. Now 
at leaft one third is brought from England ; and the difference 
between the value of the drefs ufed now, and what was ufed 
50 years ago, would nearly pay the rents of the two parifhes.

cuous : Formerly, thefe were made of the hides of oxer,, killed 
by the farmers, and farmed, by the fhoemakers of the diftrict. 
Now they are chiefly made of Englifh tanned leather, and 
none is tanned in the diftrict. Almoft every fervant has a 
coat of Englifh cloth, and a watch of Birmingham or London 
manufactory, as a neceflary appendage to drels ; while print- 
ed cottons, or other fhowey, but unfubftantial articles of drefs, 
are preferred by the young women, to the manufactures of 
the country. On the whole, the balance of manufactures, 
fold to other parifhes, or fent to Aberdeen, compared with 
the articles of drefs, both ufeful and ornamental, bought by 
the inhabitants, is far from being fo favourable to thefe pa- 
rifhes, as it was only 20 years ago. 

Remarkable Plates, -~— There are three Druids temples, and 
the remains of feveral more in this diftrict. There are 3 large 
cairns, which are feen at a confiderable diftance; one nesr 
Balbithan, called the Cairn More, or great cairn ; one at Kin- 
muck, which commands a profpect of the low country ; and 
one on the hill of Selbie, which commands a profpect of great 
part of Garrioch, Buchan, and Formartin, and the fea coaft, 
nearly from Aberdeen to Peterhead. Near the old houfe of 
Balbithan, there is a fmall ring ground, called the Law, 
where juflice was antiently adminiftered. 

Memorable Events — Tradition records, that a great battle 
was fought between the Scots and the Danes, on the moor of 
Kinmuck; a range of fields near it, now arable, and alfo the 
moor, are called Plair-haffey, which fignifies, the Field of 
Blood. The Scottifh army are faid to have killed a boar at 
Kinmuck, which denotes the hoar's head. This was an omen 

of victory. A great multitude of fmall cairns are Scattered 

over the moor ; and General Gordon, cne of the heritors, re-

members to have frequently obferved the veftiges of an en- 
campment, on the fouth fide of the moor, having a large mo- 
rafs (the mpffes of Balbithan and Kinmuck) on the back, and 
the burn of Denmjln, or Danemiln, on the right of the camp. 
The field of battle extended the whole length of the parifh of 
Kinkell, on the north, or above two Englifh miles. The 
Danes were defeated, and purfued to the burn of Dennyburn, 
or Danes-bum, on the other fide of the parifh. 

Eminent Perfons. The famous Johnfton, next to Buchan- 
an, the beft Latin poet of modern times, was born at Cafkie- 
bean, which he celebrates. He mentions a curious facl, viz. 
that the fhadow of the high mountain of Benochie, diftant a- 
bcut 6 Englifh miles, extends to the houfe of Cafkiebean, at 
the equinox. The High Conftable of Dundee, Scrimgeour, 
who fell at Harlaw, was buried at Kinkell, and has a Latin 
infcription on his monument, ill preferved. Many others, 
who fell in this battle, are faid to have been buried at Kinkell, 
which was the principal church in that part of the county. 
Tradition alfo fpeaks of an eminent woman, The Lafs of 
Path's mill. Her maiden name was Anderfon. A great 
grandfon of hers, aged 89, and a number of her defcendants, 
refide in this diftrift, and in the parifhes of Kinnellar and 
Dyce. Her father was proprietor of Patie's mill, in Keith- 
hall ; of Tuilikearie, in Fintray; and Standing Stones, in the 
parifh of Dyce. From her beauty, or fortune, or from both 
caufes, (he had many admirers ; and {he .was an only child. 
One Sangfler, laird of Boddom, in New Machar parifh, wifh- 
cd to carry her of, but was difcovered by his dog, and very 
roughly handled by her father, who was called black John 
Anderfon. In revenge, he wrote an ill naturcd fong, of which 
her great grandfon remembers thtfe words :

■who came from the fouth country, and is faid to have com- 
pofed the Song, to her praife, that is fo generally admired, and 
partakes much of the mufic, which, at that time, abounded 
between the Tay and the Tweed. Htr fecond hufband was 
one Jameb George: And (he had children by both. Like moft 
other beauties, (he was unfortunate. Her father killed a man 
in the burgh of Inverurie; and was obliged to fly to Caithnefs, 
or Orkney, where his uncle was bifhop. His flight, and the 
cxpence of procuring a pardon, ruined his eftate. This is the 
tradition. But, perhaps the Lafs of Patie's mill may be 
claimed by as many parifhes of Scotland, as Homer's birth- 
place was by the cities of Greece. It is only certain, that, in 
this diftricT:, there was a young wor - n, heirefs of Patie's mil!, 
■who was lampooned by a difcppointed lover, and pmifed by 
a fuccefsful one *. 

Language.—— The language fpoken in this diftrict. is Eng- 
Vifh, or rather that particular dialect of Scottifli, known by the 
name of Broad Buchan, or Aberdeenfhire dialect. The fre- 
quent ufe of the vowel j, long c, or diphthong ee, for o and h; — i 
the fharpnefs of the accents, which makes ftrangers believe 
that the natives are always quarrelling ; and a rife, inftead of 
a cadt nee, at the end of fentences, diflinguifh the pronuncia- 
tion of the lower clafles. Yet, there is not a provincial dia- 
led, in Britain, better underftood, on the Royal Exchange of 
London, than that of Abeideenfhire, if it be ufed without 
any aTectation. The unmufical fharpnefs of the founds renders 
it diftinftly audible. No Gaelic is fpoken within 30 Englifli 
miles of this dittrier., excepting by natives of the Highlands •, 
though many of the names of places, as, Cafkiebesn, (the Sha-

Character of the Inhabitants. They are, in general, very 

induftrious, and live plainly, and in fuch fobriety, that, fince 
2788, three different attempts, to fettle an ale-houfe among 
them, have proved abortive. They drefs better than their 
neighbours. Jt has been faid, that the people of Kintore and 
Inverury put all their money in their bellies, and thofe of 
Keith-hall and Kinkell on their backs. They are, in general, 
very charitable and humane. No inftance has occurred, in 
The memory of any perfon, of any inhabitant of the diftrict 
being brought before a court of juftice, for any crime. Se- 
veral of the young men go to Aberdeen, as mechanics : But 
none go into the navy, and very few into the army. 

State in 1782, £5* 1783. Several families, who would 

not allow their poverty to be known, lived on two diets of 
meal a day. One family wanted food from Friday night till 
Sunday at dinner. On the laft Friday of December, 1782, 
the country people could get no meal in Aberdeen, as the ci- 
tizens were afraid of a famine ; and a poor man, in this dif- 
tricl:, could find none in the country, the day after : But the 
didrefs'of this family being difcovered, they were fupplied. 
Next day, the feflion bought, at a fale, a confiderable quan- 
tity of bear, which was made into meal. This ferved the 
poor people, till the importation at Aberdeen became regular-, 
•and every man of humanity rejoiced, that the danger of fa- 
mine was removed. In the beginning of this century, many 
died of want, in particular, 10 highlanders, in a neighbouring 
parifh, that of Kemnay ; fo that the feflion got a bier made 
to carry them to the grave, not being able to afford coffins for 
fuch a number. At that period, the Earl of Kintore gave 
i fame

fomc of his tenants oxen ; fome of them, oats for feed, and a 
year's rent, to take his vacant farms, in this diftrift ; and for- 
gave arrears of rent, in the bad feafon. In 1782 and 1783, a 
converfion, at a moderate rate, was allowed to thofe tenants 
who were in arrears ; and thofe, who were removed from 
their farms, were allowed to keep a horfe and a cow, and 
their houfehold furniture. Since the decay of the feudal fyf- 
tem, however, there is not the fame attachment, between 
landlords and their tenants, or vaflals, which fubfifted about 
80 years ago. 

Advantages and Difadvantages The advantages of this dif- 

tricl are, good foil near the rivers, freedom from mill-mul- 
tures; the (locking manufacture; the high price of black cat- 
tle at prefent, and the fobriety of the people. 

The difadvantages are, diftance from lime and marie, and 
from any confiderable market-town ; — the fudden increafe of 
rents, which were raifed above onefifth part, all at once, and 
beforeany improvements could be made on the farms; — the im- 
politic reduction of the farmers to a certain number of fub- 
tenants, inftead of reftricting the fize of the croft to tradef- 
men and day-labourers , — the fcareity of mechanics, and the 
badnefs of their work; — rents being paid in kind, i. e. in bear 
and oatmeal ; — the number of carriages, or feudal fervices, e- 
very farmer being obliged to bring 6 cart-loads from Aberdeen 
yearly, to the principal heritor, befuies, peats from the mofs; — 
want of ftock in the farmers, who were never rich ; — bad hou- 
fes, owing to the farmers having had no leafes for 20 years be- 
fore 1782, but poflefling their farms by tacit relocation; and the 
want of a chamberlain, or land fteward, under thefa£t,or and 
commilTioner,who fhouldhavepower to receive from the poorer 
tenants any arrears of rent, in fmall fums, which they could not 
pay at the term day ; with a fuperintendance over the ma-

Hoiv'do meliorate the Condition of the People. This might be 

efte£ted,by giving the tenants,:{ which is done in molt of the im- 
proved counties of Scotland,) an allowance of a year's rent for 
the building of houfes •,— by granting them longer leafes than 
1 9 years, upon progreffive rifes of rent •, — by lending them, 
without intereft, for 2 or 3 years, money to buy lime, the 
tenants bringing it out themfelves, and being bound to lay it 
on turnip or fallow grounds ; — by advancing one half of the 
value of {tone fences, the tenant paying only 5 per cent, of 
intereft, and either paying the other half, or what is general- 
ly more than half the expence, laying down the materials ; — 
giving fmall premiums 10 the farmer, who has the belt field 
of turnips \ and converting, where a farmer has a certain num- 
ber of acres in fown grufs, all the carriages and leet peats in- 
to money ; — encouraging meetings, where the farmers mayo- 
pen their minds, md communicate their plans to one another; 
— encouraging day labourers, and difcouragingall large crofts, 
whofc occupiers fpend the fummer in leading home more peats, 
than would ferve many day-labourers ; — encouraging good 
ploughmen, by fmall premiums ; and proportioning both the 
rents and fize of farms, better than they are at prefent.

<p>Name, Situation, &amp;c. 
'HE antient, as well as the modern name of this parifh, 



-*- is Kilmuir, which, in Gaelic, fignines, the church of 
Mary, to whom, at a very remote period, it had been dedica- 
ted. — —It is fituated in the county of Invernefs, in the ifland 
and prefbytery of Sky, and fynod of Glenelg. — The form of 
the inhabited part of the parifli is a femicircle, having within 
it, the extremity of a ridge of mountains, which runs from 
North to South, through this and two other parifhes. Its 
length is n computed, or about 16 Englifh miles ; and its 
breadth is fuppofed to be at leaft 8 Englifh ones. It is bound- 
ed by the parifh of Snizort on the fouth, and in every other 
quarter, is furrounded by the fea. The air is moid, but not un- 
healthy ; and the inhabitants are not fubjecl: to any peculiar 
or epidemical diforders. The nature of the foil, in general, is 
a deep and fertile clay ; but the reaping of the produce is ra- 
ther uncertain, on account of the variablenefs of the climate.

The general appearance of the inhabited part of the country 
is flat. The hills, in the lower part of the diftrid, are green, 
but the mountains are covered with heath. 

Coajl, Fi/J}, 5sV The extent of the fea-coaft may be 

computed at 30 Englifh miles. The fhores are in general high 
and rocky. — There is a great quantity and variety of fifh to be 
caught on the coaft,— fuch as herrings, cod, ling, turbot, 
fkate, &amp;e. but the fifh are caught, not by regular filhermen, 
but by the country people, for the ufe of their families, when 
their domeftic occupation will permit, and are not fold or fent 
to foreign markets. When a flioai of herrings comes on the 
coaft, whales of various kinds and magnitudes follow it. 
Some fcals always frequent the rocks and fmall iflands, belong- 
ing to the parifh.— Strong gales from the north-weft very fre- 
quently throw into feveral creeks in the parifh, great quan- 
tities of common fea-weed and tangle. When this happens 
in the months of March and April, the people lay it on their 
fields as manure, and it produces an excellent crop of barley. 
— There are about 80 tons of kelp made annually from the 

fea-weed cut fiom the rocks. At the northern extremity of 

the parifh, lhere is a high and rocky promontory called Hu- 
nifh, at the point of which, there is a moft rapid current. 
It is believed, that a light-houfe would be of great fervice to 
mariners at that place, more efpecially, as it is not far diftant 
from the dangerous rocks of Sker-na-mile — There are nume- 
rous creeks, in which boats can enter ; but only two places, 
in which vefiels of large burden can anchor with fafety. The 
firft is the harbour of Duntulm, which enjoys the advantage 
of moft excellent holding ground, and is admirably fheltercd 
on all quarters, the north-weft, perhaps, excepted. At the 
fouth end of the harbour, which is the proper place for vef- 
fels to enter, there are the ruins of the fupeib callle of Dun- 
tulm 



of Kilmuir. 



549 



tulm, the antient refidence of the M'Donald family, fituated 
on a high rock, the foot of which is warned by the fea. — 
The other harbour is called the bay of Altivaig, which has 
good ground for anchorage ; but, being open to the northern 
fea, is judged rather unfafe. The iflands on the coafl: of this 
parifh, are five, Tulm, Flada-whein, Altivaig, Flada, and 
Troda. 

Migratory Birds. The cuckow, in a good year, an- 
nounces, pretty early, the approach of fummer with her 
notes. It is not unufual to hear 3 or 4 of them at one time. 

The fwans come hither in the beginning of winter, and 

live on a lake in this neighbourhood, till the hatching feafon 
comes on. Then they go home to their native north, and re- 
main there, until the next winter froft precludes them from 
food in thofe countries, and drives them to happier climes. Hun- 
dreds of them, at a time, may be feen moving in all the majefty, 
that any of the feathered tribe can be poflefled of, on the furfacc 
of the aforefaid lake. — There is another migratory bird, that 
comes to Flada-whein, and no farther. It is a water fowl, of a 
beautiful colour and fhape, not fo large as a common duck. 
It has a coulter bill of a red colour, with a white ftripe acrof: . 
Its food is fifh. The mod diftinguifhing characlerillic of this 
bird, is, that the time of its appearance and departure is as re- 
gularly fixed, as that of the ftork. About the 8th day of May, 
a few emiflaries appear on the ifland. As thefe generally find 
all quiet, they do not return ; and the great flock comes to the 
place on the 12th. They hatch in burrows under ground. 
When the country people go thither to fifh, they catch fome 
of them. The poor bird finding the hand of the enemy about 
to enter its abode, pufhes out the egg, and retires farther in ; 
but the covetous depredator is feldom fatisfied with that offer- 
ing but carries away the bird alfo. On, or about the 1 ft of 

Auguft,

Augud, they all depart, and are not feen again for three quar- 
ters of a year. —Inthat ifland there are a few of the fowl called, 
by naturalids, the fmall petterell. It appears to be the lead of 
aquatic birds ;— not larger than a darling. It is of a black co- 
lour, and much more lively in its flight and motions on the 
ground, than water fowls generally are. The upper mandible at 
the point, goes crooked over the lower- There is a protube- 
rance at the roof of it, in which the noftrib are fixed. It is 
a very uncommon bird, and is mod frequently feen at fea. 
Mariners fay, that [it follows fhips in their wake for many 
days. The vulgar name, they give them, is, Mother Gary's 
Chickens. 

Church and Stipend. •• — The church was built 200 years 
ago ; and, of late, has gone much out of repair. The manfe 
was built 13 years ago. The value of the living, including 
the glebe, is L. 80. The king is patron. - All the inha- 
bitants are of the Edabliflied church, except 2 or 3 Roman 
Catholics. 

Population. — The antient date of the population, in this, 
and many of the neighbouring parities, cannot be afcertained, 
no proper or accurate regider having ever been kept. In 
1755, the return to Dr Webder, was 1572 fouls. The a- 
mount of the population now is 2065. The number of males 
is 999', of females 1066. All refide in the country. Both 
men and women frequently live to the age of 80. There 

are fome men above 90 ; very few reach 100. The people 

are modly employed in hufbanclry. There are alfo fome 
handicraftfmen ; but there is fo little work for them, that 
they live poorly when they happen to have no land. No 
men of landed property refide here, the whole parifh belong- 
ing to Lord M'Donald ; but the principal farmers are well e-

ducated and well informed ; and there arc many officers of 
the army, who have retired here on half pay, after having 
bravely ferved their country, who pofl'efs all thofe polite and 
elegant accomplifhments, by which their profeffion is diftin- 
guiflied. 

In former times, the fmall-pox frequently prevailed to a ve- 
Ty great height, and fometimes almoft depopulated the coun- 
try. The people in general are now fo well convinced of the 
propriety of inoculation, that it is become the practice univer- 
fally, and many ufeful lives are faved by it. None have died 
from want fmce 1688. The feafons were then fo eminently 
unfavourable to the growth of corn, that the quantity was not 
only fmall, but deficient in its nutritive quality ; fo that the 
poor actually perifhed on the highways, for want of aliment. 
This country has been often in diflrefs fmce that time, but 

not to fuch an extreme degree.. About 20 years ago, 

fome families emigrated from this parifh to America, but none 
fmce. The revolution in that country, has fent home to us 
lately, a few of our friends. The parifh affords fufficient em- 
ployment for all the inhabitants ; but many of the young men, 
notwithftanding, to the great detriment of this part of the 
country, go to the fouth of Scotland, to earn higher wages. 
At the fame time, the reward for labour was never fo high 
here as at prefent ; and the product of that labour not riling 
proportionally in value ; the farmers find fervants wages to be 
a ferious and diftreffing affair, though the fums they pay, are 
not equal to thofe given farther fouth. 

Produce. — The vegetables raifed here, are fuch as are ufual 
in the fbuth of Scotland, and they thrive equally well, both in 
our gardens and fields. Any trees, which have been planted 
near the fea, have failed. They flourifhed till they rofe higher 

than

than the wall which fenced them, and then withered. — This 
parilh has more land, employed in raifing corn, than any other 
in this ifland. In the particular diftrict in which the incum- 
bent lives, the eye can at one view fee four miles, which look 
like one continued field of corn, there not being the fmalleft por- 
tion of muir within that extent. The reft of the parifh alfo, is 
well enough calculated for the production of corn, though not 
equal to this part. It fupplies itfelf with provifion, andin plen- 
tiful years it furnifhes oatmeal to thofe adjacent : but when the 
crop happens co fail, the inhabitants live worfe than thofe in 
other parifhes. The flatnefs of the country, difqualifying it 
for breeding fheep ; and their fineft fields being in tillage, fum- 
mer grafs is rendered more fcarce, and lefs productive of 
milk. When meal, therefore, their chief fupport, is not 
abundant, there is but little elfe to fupply the deficiency; and 
when it is very fcarce, as happened in the year 1778, the 

people are deeply diftreffed. They fow in March, April, 

and the beginning of May, and reap from the 20th of Auguft 
to the 20th of October. In 1782 and 1783, the crop failed, 
and the people were in a very bad fituation, till a fupply of 
meal, (which fold at a very high price), was brought from 
Banff and Murray. 

Poor The number of poor, receiving alms, is about 60. 

The funds for their fupply are very trifling, confifting only of 
a few halfpence, collected on Sunday, and fines exacted from 
delinquents ; fo that the Sefiion cannot give them; at an ave- 
rage, above 3s. or 3s 6d at mod, per annum, a piece, even to 
the molt diltreffed, and ftill lefs to others. They are there- 
fore principally fupported by the generofity of the people at 
large; and a heavy burden it is. The whole poor's funds do 
.riot exceed L. 7. or L. 8. a year. 



Prices 



of Kihnulr.

Prices of Provi/ion and Labour. — There are no regular markets 
btit for live cattle, which fell at various prices, accord- 
ing to their quality. Eutter fetches ios, per ftone, (tron 
•weight, or 24 lb.) and cheefe 4s. This being a plentiful year, 
(an. 1790), the boll of oatmeal, confifting of 16 pecks, fells 
for 13s 4d. fmall mutton for 5s. and fome for 6s. each, com- 
mon fowls, even when lean, are fold at 6d A day's wages 

to a labourer in hufbandry, &amp;c. are from 6d. to 8d. exclufive 
of victuals. Carpenters and tailors ufually make a charge for 
a whole piece or job of work. When a common labourer is 
married, he has liberty to build a houfe on his mailer's farm ; 
and he gets grafs for a certain number of cows and fheep, as 
they fix on. The mailer, with his plough and fervants, tills 
and harrows as much ground as will contain the quantity of oat 
feed, (perhaps two bolls) fpecified in the agreement; befides 
which, a fmall portion of ground is allotted for a little barley, 
and potatoes. With thefe the wife and children of the cotta- 
ger live eafy, and he gets victuals and fhoes for himfelf, 
from his mailer. But it is only with gentlemen far- 
mers, that labourers are hired on fuch terms. Male fer- 
vants have from L 3. to L. 5 fterling per annum, and female 
fervants from ios. to 30s. with victuals and fhoes. The com- 
mon people employ their fervants in hufbandry, and domeftic 
affairs, by turns, as occafion requires. 

Agriculture. — There is a great number of ploughs in the 
perifh. They difFer a little in fhape from the low country 
ploughs, but are drawn after the fame manner by four horfes. 
No oxen are ufed. The fmall tenants ufe the plough, only in 
weak ground, about the end of fpring. They have a notion, 
which cannot eaf.ly be removed, but which they fay is amply 
confirmed by experience, that plowed land does not produce 
near the quantity of corn, that it would do, if tilled with an

fa£f to be as they ftate it, the expence of tillage, in this way, 
is fo great, that the return, it is prefumed, is fcarcely ade- 
quate to it. All the farms are inclofed, and feparated from 
each other, by march dykes; and the whole parifh, therefore, 
may be faid to be inclofed. The people are very fenfible of 
the advantages, nay, of the inuifpenfible neceffity of inclof-

nent perfons of the noble family of M'Donald, by far the moil 
numerous and powerful of the Highland clans. Among 
thpfe, who are now no more, the late Sir James M'Donald 
Hands eminently diftinguiflied. His character has juflly been 
accounted one of the moft eftimable in modern times. His 
natural parts were of a very fuperior order ; arid they were 
greatly improved by a liberal education at home, and by all 
the advantages of foreign travel. He died at Rome in July* 
1766, in the 24th year of his age, univerfally regretted, both 
by his countrymen, and by foreigners, who contended with 
each other, who mould pay the greateft marks of refpedt to 
his merit and his virtues. 

Mifcellaneous Facis and Obfcrvations . There is abundance 

of free ftone and common ftone, which the people ufe in 
building their houfes. Some lime ftone, of a moft excellent 
quality, is found on the neighbouring fhore, but difficult to 
quarry, being a long continuation of a very folid flat rock, 
which is expofed to view, when the tide ebbs. There are the 
remains of Popiftl chapels, in many places ; and there are 6 
Danilh forts, as. they are called. It improbable, however, 
rlut thefe were rather places, from which, by means of fire, 

or

•r fome other fignal, notice was given of the approach of an 
enemy, than ufed for the purpofes of defence. The Gaelic 
language is principally fpoken, more efpecially by the lower 
ranks ; but mod of the names of places are derived from the 
Danifh or Norwegian. Peat is the only fuel ufed here. 

The people of this country, and indeed of all the "Weftern 
Highlands, have fignalized themfelves, in the tall, and in the 
former wars, by their valour, and their ability in bearing e- 
very fpecies of hardlhip and fatigue. They are pofiefTed of 
vivacity and penetration in a high degree. Their general fize 
is from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet. The grcateft height, that 
any has attained is 6 feet 4 inches. There are no manufac- 
tures, but of fuch coarfe cloths and linens, as the country 
people wear. The inhabitants are very economical, induf- 
trious, and humane. In the feafaring line, they are not par- 
ticularly acYive. There is a fmall boat or two, in every farm 
on the coaft, for the purpofe of Hilling ; but they are feldom 
launched. Crimes are rarely committed. About 25 years 
ago, a man was overtaken with a ftolen fheep on his flioul- 
der, by two neighbouring tenants. The thief declared to 
them, that this was his firft trefpafs -, and offered a reward, 
if they would keep it a profound fecret. But they declined to 
accept of the one, or to do the other. The fheep was fet at 
liberty •, and the poor wretch hung himfelf, next morning, to 
the roof of his own houfe. 

There is not a fingle bridge in the parifh. In former times, 
the roads were quite negle&amp;ed, untd within thefe few years, 
when a great number of the principal perfons in the diftrict, 
were made Juftices of the Peace, who all unite, in feeing the 
roads properly attended to j and their efforts are crowned 
with fuccefs. At firft, they exacted the ftatute labour in kind; 
but, finding that method not fo efficacious, they commuted it 
into money.

In a low valley, there is a fmall hill, fhaped like a houfe, 
and covered with fmall trees, or rather fhrubs, of natural 
growth. At one fide of it, there is a lake of foft water, from 
which there is no vifible discharge. Its water finds many paf- 
fages through the hill, and makes its appearance, on the other 
fide, in a great number of fprings, of the very pureft kind : 
They all run into an oval bafon below, which has a bottom of 
white fand, and is the habitation of many fmall fifli. From 
that pond, the water runs, in a copious ftream, to the fea. 
At the fide of this rivulet, there is a bath, made of ftone, 
and concealed from public view, by fmall trees furrounding 
it. Its name is Loch Shiant, or the facred lake. There was 
once a great refort of people, afflicted with ailments, to this 
place. They bathed themfelves, and drank of the water, 
though it has no mineral quality ; and, on a fhelf, made for 
the purpofc, in the wall of a contiguous inclofure, they left 
offerings of fmall rags, pins, and coloured threads, to the di- 
vinity of the place. 

At the northern termination of the ridge of mountains be- 
fore-mentioned, there is a moft curious concealed valley ; It is 
on all fides furrounded with high rocks, and accefiible to man 
or beaft only in three or four places. A perfon, feeing the 
top of thefe rocks, could never imagine that they furrounded 
fo great a fpace of ground In barbarous times, when per- 
petual feuds and difcords, fubfifted between the clans, tofuch 
a degree, that life and moveable property could not be fecure, 
when the approach of an enemy was announced, the weakeft 
of the inhabitants, with all the cattle, were fent into that fe- 
cret afylum, where (hangers could never difcover them, with- 
out particular information. It is fo capacious as to hold, (but 
not to pafture for any length of time) 4000 head of cattle. 
It is juftly accounted a very great natural curiofity.

About half a mile from the church, there is a mineral well, 
of the chalybeate kind, but not much reforted to. 

Fifty years ago, the old Highland drefs univerfally prevail- 
ed. Hats, long coats, boots, fpurs, watches, &amp;c. were 

rare. Now, every gentleman wears them ; and perfons of 
fubftance, of both fexes, drefs as fafhionably, and live in a 
flile as elegant, as thofe of the fame rank in the fouthern parts 
of Scotland. 1 he common people, in general, ft ill wear the 
Highland garb, and adhere more clofely, to ancient cuftoms 
and manners, than their fuperiors. All the fuperftitious and 
delufive notions, however, which formerly accompanied po- 
pery, have entirely vaniflied ; and the people's ideas of reli- 
gion and morality, are rational and folid.

PARISH OF <name ref="NA">ROSSKEEK</name> 

(county OF ROSS.) 
By the Rev. Mr. Urquhart.</head> 



<p>Origin of Name, Situation, &amp;fc. 
'THHE pnrifh of Rofskeen does not furnifh much room for 

ftatiftical inveftigation. The name feems to be 

derived from the Gaelic word Coinnea, fignifying a meeting 
or junction, and Rofs- coinnea mzy denote the place, where the 
diftricts of Eafter and Wefter Rofs join, (which is at the welt- 
er boundary of this parifh,) and where the inhabitants might 
occafionally afiemble. It is centrical in point of diftance betwixt 
the two royal burghs of Tain and Dingwal. — The parifh be- 
longs to the prefbytery of Tain, and fynod of Rofs _ 

Its extent, fo far as it is inhabited, may be from the fhore to 
the hills, about 10 meafured miles, and its average breadth 
about 6. 

Surface and Soil The lower part of the parifh, which 

extends along the firth of Cromarty, and for 2 miles back, 
lies on a gentle and eafy afcent to the bottom of the firfl: hills. 
The foil varies, being partly gravelly and light, partly loam ; 

tand 



of Rofskeen. 



559 



and fome a deep and ftrong clay. A hill called Knock-Navic, 
or the cold Hill, divides the lower from the Highland part of 
the parifh. In the higher parts, the arable land is wet and 
fpungy ; the foil light, and more adapted for paflurage than for 
the plough. Beyond the higher arable ground, and inhabi- 
ted glens, there is a very confulerable trad of mountains, fit 
for no other purpofe, than the fummcr pafturage of a few 
black cattle, which, perhaps, might be converted with much 
advantage, into ihecp walks. 

Improvements. About 60 years, ago there were no plan- 
tations of any kind within this parifh, and no natural woods, 
excepting about the place of Ardrofs. But fince that period, 
by the continued attention of Sir William Gordon, and his 
fon, Sir John Gordon of Invergordon, a very extenfive, well 
wooded, and beautiful place, has been formed about Inver- 
gordon cattle, now the feat of Mr M'Leod, of Cadboll . 

The eftate of Milncraig has alfo had very extenfive plantations 
made upon it, and a confulerable farm about the houfe, has 

been effectually inclofed and fubdivided. There are other 

confulerable plantations of the Scottilh fir, in a very thriving 
condition, on other properties within the parifh. 

A circumftance, which well merits notice, in an account of 
this kind, is, that the parifh is peculiarly fortunate in the 
means of future improvement, from a molt extenfive and rich 
"bed of fheli-marle, of above 70 acres extent, which lies in the 
middle of the lower diftricl:, on the property of Munro of Cul- 
rain, is of eafy accefs, and can be procured at the pit, ready 
thrown out, at 3d. per boll. Its fertilizing OjUaiity has been 
amply proved on the farm of Tvlilncraig, in its neighbourhood; 
but, from the ftrange and unaccountable prejudices of the low- 
er,clafs of people, to any fpecies of innovation pn their own plan 
of management, it is, as yet, in very little requeft. 'Tis pity 

that 



Statijlical Account 



that fome (kilful farmer of fpirit, from thofe diftri&amp;s wlic. 
fnarle is much ufed, 'did not take fome of the capital farm; 
in this neighbourhood. While he enriched himfelf, h 
might teach others how to add confiderably to the means c 
their fubfiftence, and to the improvement of their country. 

Population The population of the parifh, as returned to 

Dr Webfter in 1755, was 1958 fouls. There are now in it 
1400 examinable perfons above, and 300 under 6 years of 
age. The births are, at an average, from 40 to 50 per annum. 
No accurate account of deaths and marriages can be given. 
The number of inhabitants has of late been much increafed, by 
a fpecies of cottagers, here called meallers, who build a fmall 
houfe for themfelves, on a wafte fpot of ground, with the con- 
fent of the proprietor, and there, are ready to hire themfelves 
out as day-labourers. At their fpare hours, they trench and 
improve fmall bits of the muir around them, which they firft 
plant with potatoes, and afterwards fow with grain. Though 
their improvements, taken individually, are trifling and flow, yet 
in the aggregate, they amount, inacourfe of years, to fomething 
confiderable. They pay hardly any confideration to the land- 
lord, during the life of the firft fettler. But, upon the whole, 
it is obferved, that from their labour, and the induftry of 
their wives and children, they live more comfortably, than 
thofe in a fuppofed fuperior clafs, and enjoy perfect indepen- 
dence. 

Rents. Lands in general are let in this parifh, from 10s 

to 12s. per acre, of arable, though, on fome fituations, near 
the fhore, they draw from 15s. to 20s. and 21s. In the heights 
of the parifh, the value is not afcertained by the acre, but by 
the joint judgement of the tenant and landlord. 



I 



Climate 



ofRofskeen. 



Climate and Longevity. — The climate varies in different parts 
of the parifh ; it is often mild and temperate, and all kinds of 
farm work can be carried on in the lower part of the parifh, 
when, in the heights, thefe operations are interrupted by hard 

froft, or a fall of fnow It is, however, upon the whole, 

a healthy parifh, and many inftances occur of great longevity- 
There are at prefent many inhabitants, both male and female, 
above 80 years of age ; and, what is remarkable, there are 3 
members of the feffion, whofe combined ages amount, at this 
time, to 260 years. 

Si-hool. — The parochial fchool has been built near the Nefs 
of Invergordoni which affords the village there another advan- 
tage. It is, however, far from being centrical, and is, from 
that circumflance, much lefs attended, than otherwife it 
would be. The fchool houfe, and accommodation for the 
teachers, are fufRciently commodious. The fchoolmafter's fa- 
lary is about L. 15 per annum, which, with perquifites ufual- 
ly attached to the fituation, makes It worth about L. 25, per 
annum. 

Poor.— — The number on the poors lift is 70, which are di- 
vided into clafles, according to the degree of their refpe£tive 
neceflkies ; and the very fmall fund, allotted for their relief, 

is divided quarterly amongft them. In this parifh, there is 

hardly any fund, but the collections made in the church, af- 
ter performance of divine worfhip : ana as very few, indeed, 
of the heritors relide in the parifh, this feldom exceeds L. IJ 
per annum, from which there is a deduction of L. 2 :io fteriing 
to the felhon-clerk, and a very confiderable one for bad half- 
pence, collected ; fo that the fhare of each poor perfon mult 
be very fmall.

rifhes in the north of Scotland, are very inadequate to fhe 

end, and few more fo than this one It were much to be 

wifhed, that fome plan could be devifed for the increafe of the 
funds for the relief of the neceffitous poor, in fuch cafes as the 
one under confideration, without fubjecting the kingdom, to 
the heavy burden of a general tax. 

Patron, ffiV. — The Earl of Cromarty was patron of this pa- 
rifh, before the forfeiture in 1746. The prefent incumbent 
was fettled on a royal prefentation in 1783, before the refto- 

ration of the annexed eftates took place. Captain M'Ken- 

zie of Cromarty, coufin german, and heir of the late Lord 

M'Leod, is now the patron. The manfe is a modern 

one, and, together with the kirk, kirk-yard dyke, its offices, 
and the parifh fchool, were all put in complete repair, in the 
years 1780, 1781, and 1782. Very few country parifhes have 
their public buildings in neater, or more complete order. - - 
The value of the living depends, in fome degree, on the price 
of grain, as it confifts of 80 bolls of bear, and L. 50 fterling 
of money. There are two fmall glebes, one adjoining the 
manfe, of 4 Englifh acres of good and fertile foil ; the other 
is contiguous to th@ ruins of an old kirk, called Nonekill, (or 
the cell or temple of St. Ninian,) and confifts of above an acre 
and a half, in 3 different divifions, which are let by the mi- 
nifter to a tenant in the neighbourhood. 

Mijceltaneous Obfcrvaticns. — The Gaelic language is univer- 
sally fpoken, by the country people in this, as well as all the 
other parifhes of this prefbytery ; but it is worthy of remark, 
that, though that language does not feem to be lofing ground 
in this parifh, many more read and underftand the Englifh 
language, than did fome years ago ; a circumftance which is 

to 



of Rofskeen.

to be attributed to the Society's fchools, which have been en 
dowed in the height of the parifh. 

There are unbounded tracts of excellent peat inefs in 
the higher, and fome moiles of confiderable extent 1 in die 

lower diflricr, of the parifli. No fpecies of manufacture has 

as yet found its way to this part of the country, though few fi- 
tuations are to be found fo well adapted for their introduc- 
tion. 

There is a village of fome extent upon the Nefs of Invergor- 
don, on a dry heathy beach, where veflels of 100 tons bur- 
den can lye with fafety, moft feafons of the year, and receive 
or deliver their cargoes clofe to the fliore. 

Services of tenants are in general converted, at the rate of 
one fixteenth part of the annual land rent. The rents in gene- 
ral are paid in kind, or in bear or barley, and oat meal, wit] 
kains or cuftoms. 

The rent of the parifh may be about L. 2000 fterling, con- 
verting the boll of bear and meal at 12s. 

The fpinning of linen yarn is carried on to a confiderable 
extent, though, it muft be faid, with very little advantage to 
the people, or to the country, it being done by commiflion 
from more fouthern diftricls, whither the yarn is tranfmitted 
to be wove, or otherwife manufactured ; fo that, by paffing 
through fo many hands, each of whom muft have afmall profit, 
little can be afforded to the fpinners, who, though expert and 
induftrious, do not earn above 2f, or at moft, 3d a day, from 
their labour. But this perhaps may be foon altered, as Mr 
M'Leod, the proprietor of the village above mentioned, is 
willing to encourage fettlers, for chat purpofe, and gives per- 
petual feus of ground, fufheient for a houfe and fmall garden, 
"on moderate terms. They may alfo have as many acres of 

land in leafe, as they may find it convenient to cultivate.

500 Scots acres. The arable land principally confifts of fome

Copy of a Letter from Sir Hew Dalrymple to Sir Laurence 

DlJNDAS. 

Dear Sir, Dahell, May 24. 1775. 

Having fpent a long life, in purfuit of pleafure and health, I am 
mow retired from the world in poverty,- and with the gout ; fo 
joining with Solomon, that " all is vanity and vexation of fpirit," 
I go to church, and fay my prayers. 

I aiTure you, that moft of us religious people reap fome little 
fatisfa&amp;ion, in hoping, that you wealthy voluptuaries have a fair 
chance of being damn'd to all eternity ; and that Dives fhall call 
out for a drop of water to Lazarus, one drop of which he feldom 
tailed, when he had the twelve ApoRles, [twelve hogjleacls of claret) 
m his cellar. 

Now, Sir, that do&amp;rine being laid down, I wifh to give you, my 
friend, a loop hole to creep through. Going to church laft Sunday, 
as ufual, I faw an unknown face in the pulpit, and rifing up to pray- 
ers, as others do upon like occafions, I began to look around the 
church, to find out'if there were any pretty girls there ; when my 
attention was attracted by the foreign accent of the parfon. I gave 
him my attention, and had my devotion awakened, by the moft 
pathetic prayer I ever heard. This made me all attention to the fer- 
inon ; a finer difcourfe never came from the lips of a man. I re* 
turned in the afternoon, and heard the fame preacher exceed his 
morning work, by the fineft.chain of rcr.foningj conveyed by the 
moft eloquent exprefllons. I immediately thought of what Agrip-

Letter from Mr Dishington, to Si r John Sinclair. 
Sir, Edinburgh f Augufl id, 1 791. 

Tho' it may feem ridiculous for one to talk of his own private 
concerns, I hope, I may without incurring the cenfure of egotifm, 
or vanity, be allowed to lay before you the following narrative* 
which may ferve as an explanation of Sir Hew Dalrymple's letter. 
In the year 1776, being an afiiftant to a minifter in the Orkneys, 
who was then in a very ill ftate of health, I went to Edinburgh, to 
try, if pofiible, to fecure the furvivancy, and to be appointed his 
fucceffor. In this attempt being difappointed, I went to pay a vi- 
fit to Mr Thomas Hepburn, minifter at Athelftaneford, with whom 
I had contracled an intimacy in my early years, and from whom I 
had often experienced every mark of the moft fincere friendfhip. 
Indeed, it is but juftice to his memory, to obfcrve, that he w as the 
friend and patron of young men, who had none to recommend

years, confiderably increafed. For this, two reafortf atlay be

of having as great a number of pcrfuns on their property, as

the produce of which, their principal profit arifes.— 2. The

ing, when I happened to be with him at Athelftaneford, he receiv- 
ed a letter from one of his brethren, informing him, that being on 
his way to pay Mr Hepburn a viflt, and preach for him next day^ 
he had unfortunately fallen from his horfe, and received a flight hurt 
in his moulder. At the fame time, he deiired him, if any preach- 
ers were in the neighbourhood, to fend one to officiate for him ; up- 
on which, I was difpatched away on Sunday morning, and had the 
good fortune to be taken notice of, by my worthy and honourable 
friend, Sir Hew Dalryrnple, whofc letter to Sir Laurence Dundasr 
procured me my prefent living. 

Before my prefentation came to hand, I received a letter from

in thefe iflands ; frequently carrying off a fifth part of the in- 
habitants. Now, hardly any fuffer by this diforder. Inocu- 
tion is fuccefsfully pracYifed, even by the common people ; 
but in particular by a perfon, whofe name is John Williamfon, 
who, from his various attainments, and fuperior talents, is 

called

*' Meftrs Lindfay and Laing, inftantly to notify the firft vacancy 
" to me, that I may inform Sir Hew Dalrymple, who is going to

" may believe, that no manh as your happinefs more at heart," &amp;c. 

After the prefentation came to hand, I was in danger of lofing 
all, by the jure devoluto : the fix months fince the deceafe of my pre- 
decefior being near elapfed, at the end of which, the right of pre- 
fentation would have gone from the patron to the prefbytery. It 
was now the depth of winter, and, at that feafon of the year, there 
is ufually no communication between Orkney and Shetland ; when I 
had therefore given up all for loft, a veffel came into Papa Sound, 
in Orkney, very near the manfe, where I refided ; and, on making 
inquiry, I was told, it was the packet from Leith, on her way for 
Shetland. There again was another furprizing and uncommon cir- 
cumftance, for, it is very remarkable, that this fame packet was ne- 
ver known to put into the Orkneys, either before or fince that pe- 
riod. Not to trouble you any longer, with a detail or uninterefting 
circumftances, I haften to conclude with one general remark. Such 
a combination of fortuitous incidents, or what you pleafe to call 
them, ferved to imprcfs on my mind, the tiuth of Cicero's obferv- 
ation, more forcibly, and with a more powerful efFecT;, than a whole 
body of divinity, or 50,000 fermons, preached by the moft celebrat- 
ed doctors of the church. " A T ec vero univerfo gener'i humanofolum,

called Johnny Notions, among his neighbours. Unafiifted by 
education, and unfettered by the rules of art, he ftands unri- 
valled in this bufinefs. Several thoufands have been inocula- 
ted by him, and he has not loft a fingle patient. 

His fuccefs being fo remarkable, it may not be improper to 
take fome notice of the method he purfues, in cafe it can fur- 
nifh any ufeful hints to perfons of the medical profeffion. 
He is careful in providing the beft matter, and keeps it a long 
time before he puts it to ufe, — fometimes 7 or 8 years. And, 
in order to leffen its virulence, he firft dries it in peat fmoak, 
and then puts it under ground, covered with camphor. 
Though many phyficians recommend frefh matter, this felf- 
taught practitioner finds from experience, that it always proves 
milder to the patient, when it has loft a confiderable degree of 
its ftrength. He ufes no lancet in performing the operation, 
but, by a fmall knife, made by his own hands, he gently rai- 
fes a very little of the outer fkin of the arm, fo that no blood 
follows : then puts in a very fmall quantity of the matter, 
which he immediately covers with the fkin, that had been thus 
raifed. The only plaifter he ufes, for healing the wound, is 
a bit of cabbage leaf. It is particularly remarkable, that there 
is not a fingle inftance in his practice, where the infection has 
not taken place, and made its appearance at the ufual time. 
He adminifters no medicines during the progrefs of the difeafe; 

nor does he ufe any previous preparation. He is a fmgular 

inftance of an uncommon variety of talents, being a tailor, a 
joiner, a clock and watch-mender, a blackfmith, and a phyfi- 
cian. 

The return to Dr Webfter, in 1755, was 9S6 fouls. The 
number at prefent is 1422. The annual average of marriages 
is from 10 to 12 ; of births, about 34 ; and of burials, about 
11 The average of births, for 8 years, ending in 1738, 
was only 27.. 

Rent, 



Statijlical Account 



AY;/, t&amp;c. 1 The rent of the parifh is fuppofed tp 

be about L. 3210 Scots, or about L. 270 fterling, which, how- 
ever, is fo much below its real value, that, when any land, in 
the parifli, is fold, it generally fetches about 50 years pur- 
chafe. To account for this, it may not be improper to ob^- 
ferve, that the rents, as paid by the tenants, give a very ina- 
dequate view of the landlord's income. For although it may 
be true, that the lands are let by the proprietor, or tacksman, 
at no higher rent, than what is above dated, yet it is invaria- 
bly on this condition, that the tenant, or fifhing farmer, mail 
deliver to his land-mafter, or order, every article, that he can 
raife, (viz. fifh, oil, butter, &amp;c.) at a certain fixed price; by 
the fale of which, the landlord more than doubles his rent. 
As a proof of this, it may be ftated, that two confiderable 
landholders, finding it inconvenient for them, to receive their 
rents from their tenants, in this manner, (partly in money and 
partly in kind,) let their lands to tackfmen, who give, at 
leaft, double the nominal rent paid by the tenants, and 
find their account in it. Other landholders, however, 
make more by receiving the tenants product themfelves, 
or by their fervants under their own eye ; and would not 
let their lands in large parcels, 1 , even for double the rent 
paid in money. 

Occupations There are but few mechanics, or tradefmen, 

in thefe parifhes, the ufeful arts not having yet made their 
appearance here, in any great perfection. Wool, it is true, 
the ftaple commodity of the country, fo remarkable for its 
finenefs and foftnefs, might be a fource of induftry and opu- 
lence ; yet, in the way it has been hitherto been managed, it 
turns to very fmall account. All the women, of every rank 
and diftincYion, are employed in fpinning wool, and knitting 
fine and coarfe ftockings, to their great lofs, and miferable 

mifpending

mifpending of their time : For, if it were fairly calculatad, 
they cannot earn, by this fpecies of induftry, three halfpence 
a day. The materials they confume, in this gainful trade, might 
be manufactured into good cloths of all forts, which might 
ferve all ranks for clothing, and put a flop to that pernicious 
rage they have for foreign fopperies. The fpinning of lint, at 
the fame time, might be introduced amongft the women, to 
their great advantage. 

Poor There are no funds here, for the fupport of the 

poor, but what arife from the weekly collections, and the con- 
tributions at the difpenfing of the facrament. When old and 
weakly, they are put on a quarter, or diftrict ; and go, frorti 
houfe to houfe, in the particular diflricls of the parifii allotted 
to them ; the parifh being divided into more or lefs quarters, 
according to the number of the poor. They are clothed, and 
the expence of their funerals defrayed, by the fefiion. The 
poor's funds were very inconfidcrable, when the prefent mini- 
fter was admitted to the cure; and, in confequence of the 
great numbers of neceflitous perfons, who were fupplied from 
thefe funds, in the years of fcarcity, they are, at this time, 
quite exhaulted. 

S:h?cls. No public fchools areas yet eftablifhed here, 

though, it mull be acknowledged, that there is great need 
for them. Molt of the people, however, can read pretty 
well, and many write. 

Stipend, cs* c It is impofiible to afcertain the real value 

of the ftipend, as it is payable in articles, the prices of which 
arc very fluctuating. The ftipend h?.s been, of late, confidera- 
bly augmented, and, at prefent, confifts of the following ar- 
ticles, befides the glebe, viz. 178 lifpund and 10 merks but- 
ter 



574 



Statiflical Account 



ter ; 70 lambs and T * T of a lamb, and 4 merks wool with every 
lamb; 211 ling and 4 of a ling; 503 cans and 4 can of oil; 
and L. 175 : 15 Scots in money ; with an allowance of L. 40 
Scots for communion elements The manfe and office houfes 
were built in 1747, at the expence of L. 50 fterling ; and have 
been once repaired. On a late vifitation, the prefbytery grant- 
ed decreet, for upwards of L. 100 fterling, for another re- 
pair. The prefent incumbent was admitted minifter in 1778, 
and has a wife and 10 children. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations . The fyftem, now univer- 

fally adopted, of parcelling out the lands into very fmall por- 
tions, that the lairds may have a greater number of fifhermen, 
greatly contributes to early marriages ; fo that, a bachelor is 
a very lingular phenomenon in this country. They delve all 
their little farms with the fpade, and have no need of any con- 
fiderable flock to begin life ; all that is required being a cow, 
a pot, a fpade, a tufker, a buthie, fifhing rods, and a rug, 
or blanket. Thus, they increafe in number, notwithftanding 
their poverty. Both fexes make a very decent and genteel ap- 
pearance on Sundays. Though their crops, with the ftri&amp;eft 
economy, cannot maintain their families above 7 or 8 months 
in the year, yet, by the natural advantages they enjoy, of 
plenty of fuel, and immenfe quantities of fmall fifh, I may 
venture to affirm, that, they live fully as well, and many more 
comfortably, than the generality of the peafants in Scotland. 
Though the face of the iflands of Shetland, in general, and of 
Yell, in particular, (of which Buchanan fays, adeo /era, ut 
nullum animal, mjt illic na/um, ferat,) exhibits a very rude ap- 
pearance, yet, improvements in agriculture are not at all im- 
practicable ; and, were due attention and encouragement gi- 
ven, there is no queftion, but this country might produce as 
much com as might ferve the inhabitants. But fifhing fchemes

cngrofs all their attention ; and, the people being poor, and 
not enjoying the benefit of long leafes, until thefe obftacles 
are removed, it is not to be imagined, that ever any remark- 
able exertions will take place among them, in cultivating the 
ground. 

No veftiges of any antiquities, excepting a few PicYifh or 
Danifh forts, &amp;c. which merit no particular defcription, are 
to be found here. It is mod likely, that the Romans were 
utterly unacquainted with the Shetland Ifles. The Ifland of 
Fula was probably defcried by them, from the Orkneys, in 
their circumnavigation of Britain, its name being fo fimilar 
to that of Thule, mentioned by Tacitus. 

General Character.— The people, in general, are fober and 
inoffenfive. Crimes of an atrocious nature are little known 
amongft them. They are judicious, of a ready and acute un- 
derftanding, capable of enduring great toil, cold, and hunger, 
fupra quam cuique credibile eji ; run prodigious rifles, in going 
out i© or 1 1 leagues into the ocean, on the ling and tufk fifli- 
ing, in fmall fix-oar'd boats, which, together with all their fifh- 
ing materials, they provide at their own expence. They prove 
excellent feamen, when they go abroad ; are much efteemed 
in the Britifh navy; and, confideied in this point of view, 
well merit the attention and favour of government. This 
obfervation, indeed, may be applied, with equal juftice, to 
Shetland in general. In religious matters, they enjoy a hap- 
py moderation and uniformity of fentiment ; their faith not 
being diltracled by controverfy, ngr fectarifm infefting their 
abodes. </p>

It appears, from their records, that the Dyers and Skinners 
were, about a century ago, among the moft numerous corporations, 
and that the Coopers were, then, more numerous, owing to a con« 
fiderable wine trade carried on with France. 

Befides the above incorporated trades, there are, in the country 
part of the parifh, 5 blackfmiths, 3 cart-wrights, and 2 t3vlorS:

a. NEWTON upon AYR. 

THE following account is the refult of a pretty accurate 
furvey of the population of Newton upon Ayr, ma.dc 
in the month of October, 1791. 



Houfes inhabited 268 From 50 to 60 139 

Do. uninhabited, (fome of — — 60 to 70 lot 

them in ruins) 20 — 70 to 80 33 

Families 408 80 to 90 7 

Souls 1689 Married pairs 298 

Males 836 Unmarried men above 18 96 

Females 853 Do. women above 16 if$ 

Above 7 years of age 1391 Widows 90 

Under do. 298 Widowers 28 

From 7 to 14 252 Born in the parilh 759 

— — 141020 216 Born outoftheparifli 930 

— 20 to 30 303 Of thefe, born in Ireland 

— — 30 to 4© 165 about 60 



— 401050 175 and in England 14 

From the above account, it will appear furprifing, that the 
number of males and females fhould be fo nearly equal. But 
all thofe who are at fea, being included in the number of 
males, and many more men than women being employed in 
the weaving buGnefs, and at the coalleries, thefe circumftan- 
ces will, in a great degree, account for this equality. It is 
fingular, that the number below 7 years of age, and of mar- 
ried pairs, mould be exactly the fame. It may likewife be 
remarked, that if the parifli does not increafe in population, as 
i£ has done for 30 years, (which is not probable, as it has 
4 D % been

been chiefly owing to the accefiion of foreigners,) the riHm- 
ler born in the parilh, in a few years, will greatly exceed the 
number born out of it, which will be the reverfe of the above 
ftatement. It is fufpec*ted, that many more of the inhabitants 
have been born in Ireland, than 60 ; feveral of them being 
unwilling to tell the place of their birth, being poor, and af- 
raid of being turned out of the town. Upon the whole, the 
average number to a family is about 4 fouls, and the greateft 
number, in the above diviuon of ages, is from 20 to 30.

The inhabitants of the town «f Ayr, amounting to 3781
