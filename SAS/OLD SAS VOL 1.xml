INTRODUCTION. 



IT is now about twelve months fince I firfl: had the 
honour of circulating among the Clergy of the 
Church of Scotland a variety of Queries, for the pur- 
pofe of elucidating the Natural Hiftory and Political 
State of that Country. My original idea was, to have 
drawn up from their returns a general Statiftical view 
of North Britain, without any particular reference to 
Parochial diftrids. But I found fuch merit and abi- 
lity, and fo many ufeful fads and important obferva- 
tions in the anfwers which were fent me, that I could 
not think of depriving the Clergy of the credit they 
were entitled to derive from fuch laborious exertions ; 
and I was thence induced to give the Work to the 
Public in its prefent fliape. 

It would have been more defirable to have had 
the accounts of the different Pariflies arranged by 
Prefbyteries or Counties, for the purpofe of con- 
nexion, and to prevent repetition, where the circum- 
ftances of the different diflridls were nearly fimilar. 
But it was not to be expefted that complete informa- 
tion refpedling any one of the larger divifions of the 
l^ngdom, could be at once obtained. It was there- 
fore 



C vi ) 



fore thought mofl: advifable to throw as much varie- 
ty as poffible into the Firft Volume, that rhe Reader 
might be enabled to form fome general idea of the 
State of the Kingdom even from this part of the 
Work. Whether the fame plan is to be perfevered 
in, or whether more regularity and connexion are to 
be attended to in future, will depend on the unani- 
mity and difpatch with which the Clergy tranfmit the 
neceffary information to the Author. 

The variety of bufinefs, both of" a public and of a 
private nature, in which I have of late been engr-gcd, 
has prevented me from arranging or abridging, fo 
completely as otherwife I fhould have done, the an- 
fwers included in this Volume ; and, indeed, that 
part of the Work mufl: be attended with confiderable 
difficulty, unlefs the Clergy in general will do, what 
many of them have very fuccefsfuUy executed, name- 
ly, tranfmit their accounts prepared for immediate 
publication. Anfwers to the Queries, however, which 
have been circulated, are ftill requeued ; but, where 
it is equally convenient, it is certainly more defirable 
that the Clergy fiiould confider the Queries merely as 
a key to inquiry ; and the models which are now fet 
before them, together with the annexed Analyfis, will 
be of fervice in pointing out the belt mode of draw*, 
ing up the Statiftical Account of the different di- 
tlricls. 



( vu ) 



It would be improper to conclude without returning 
my beft acknowledgments to the Clergy in general, for 
the attention they have paid to the difl'erent requifi- 
tions with which I have troubled them, and for the 
very polite and flattering manner with which they have 
perfonally addreffed themfelves to me on the occafion. 
The fpirit and alacrity with which they have enga- 
ged in fo laborious an undertaking muft ever do 
them infinite credit ; and they mufl feel the utmofl 
fatisfaftion from the refledion, that they have con- 
tributed to the formation of a Work, of which it 
may be truly faid, in the words of a refpedable citi- 
zen of this country *, " That no Publication of equal 
*« information and curiofity has appeared in Great 
** Britain fmce Dooms-day Bookj and that, from the 
** ample and authentic fads which it records, it muft 
** be reforted to by every future Statefman, Phiiofo- 
" pher, and Divine, as the bed bafis that has ever 
** yet appeared for political fpeculation.'*

Origin of the Name. 

IN a charter granted by William the Lyon of Scotland, to 
the abbot and monks of Jedburgh, in the year 1 165 *,. 
the names of Jedwarth and Jedburgh are promifcuoufly 
ufed ; but in modern times the name of Jedburgh 'alone is 
retained. The name is fometimes written with a G ; and is 
faid to be derived from the Gadeni, a tribe who antiently in- 
habited the whole tradt of country that lies between Nor- 
thumberland and the river Tiviot. It was perhaps the capi- 
tal city belonging to the tribe, and hence obtained the name 
of Gadburgh or Jedburgh. 

Vol. I. A Extent. 



* A fac fimile copy of this charter was publiflied at Edin- 
burgh by A. Bell, anno 1771.

Staiijlical Account 



Extent, — The extent of this parlfti is confiderable, being 
about thirteen miles long, and in feme places not lefs than fix 
or feven miles broad : But the figure is irregular, being fre- 
quently interfe£led by the parifhes of Oxnam and Southdean. 
It is bounded by Northumberland on the fouth and fouth- 
eaft, by the parifli of Oxnara on the eaft, by Southdean on 
the fouth and fouth- weft, by Bedrule on the weft, by Ancrum 
on the north and north-weft, and by Crailing on the north- 
eaft. 

Situation and Surface. — The parifti is fituated within the 
county of Roxburgh or Tiviotdale. It is the feat of a 
prefbytery, (that of Jedburgh) and belongs to the fynod of 
Merfe and Tiviotdale. The foil is various. The lower part 
of the parifli, lying upon the banks of the Tiviot, is flat, and 
in general confifts of light loam ; but fome part of it is gra- 
velifti, and fome deep clay. By far the greater part of the 
parifli, however, confifts of hills and fiieep fafms. The hills 
are generally green and dry ; but the interjacent flats are co- 
vered with bent, and rather fwampy*. On the whole, not 
above a fifth or fixth part of the parifli confifts of arable 
ground. 

Climate^ Difeafes, isfc — The climate alfo varies in different 
parts of the parifli. It is often mild and temperate in the 
town of Jedburgh, environed with the high banks of the ad- 
jacent river, while it is fliarp and cold at the diftance of 
a mile or two. The town itfelf is peculiarly healthy, fewer 
epidemical diftempers prevailing there than in the neigh- 
bouring towns of Hawick and Kelfo. The rheumatifm is 
the moft common difcrder, which, though not frequent a- 
mong people of better* ftation, who are comfortably cloth- 
ed, fed, and lodged, is neverthelefs very general among the 
poorer fort of people, particularly fuch as are advanced in 

life. 



of Jedburgh.

life, who, in confequence of tlieir miferable mode of living, and 
ftili more of the coldnefs and dampnefs of their houfes, owing 
partly to the fcarcity and high price of fewel, have too much 
reafon to complain of what they call the pains, or the pains 
within them. The air, however, on the whole, being very 
falubrious, there are many inftances of longevity in the pa- 
rifli. An old woman, who died 15 years ago, faid that fhe 
was 105 ; but her name was not in the parifh record. There 
are feveral now living, both in the town and country part of 
the parifh, above 80. Many have furvived 90 during the in- 
cumbency of the prefent minifler ; and there are three per- 
fons in the town, now living, who are above 90. There is 
alfo a fhepherd in the 94th yeu: of his age, who attends his 
flock as ufual. The ravages which the fmall-pox formerly 
made have been greatly mitigated, innoculation being of late 
very general and very fuccefsful. In order to reconcile the 
minds of the common people to this ufeful pradlice, the he- 
ritors of Jedburgh, about ten years ago, allowed a fmall fum 
to defray the expence of innoculating the children of the 
poor, at a period when the difeafe was peculiarly fatal. This 
generous defign was attended with the happieft fuccefs ; a- 
mong a thouland patients, innoculated by Dr Lindfay in 
the courfe of above 20 years pradlice, only two have been loll", 
and there is the ftrongeft reafon to believe that thefe two had 
been previoufly infefted in the natural way. The other phy- 
ficians and furgeons of the place have alfo been, it is believ- 
ed, equally fortunate In this important branch of their pra(5tice. 

Rivers. — The river Jed, which runs through this parifli, 
has its fourcc in the north fide of the Carter-hill, in the pa- 
rifli of Southdean, about the diflance of fourteen miles from 
the town of Jedburgh *. It abounds with trouts, particu- 
larly 

* On the fouth fide of the fame hill, tJie river Tyne, which 
luns by Kewcaftle, takes its rife.

larly with a fpecies of fmall red trout, of an excellent flavour. 
The river Tiviot alfo paffes through this parifli the banks of 
which at firft are fteep, and its courfe rapid, yet afterwards 
it flows in beautiiul curves, through wide and fertile haughs. 
In addition to its natural, it is to be hoped, that, in time, it will 
have artificial Itreams, as it is believed, from a late furvey, that 
a canal might be carried from the fea to Ancrum Bridge. At 
prelent, however, there are no internal commodities to com- 
penfate for the great expence which fuch a work would re- 
quire. 

Alineral Springs There sre two chalybeate fprings near 

Jedburgh, and there are appearances of more in different places 
of the parifli, which have never been yet properly inveftigated. 
One of the former, called Tud Hope Well, h is been ufed with 
fuccefs in fcorbutic, and, it is faid, in rheumatic diiorders. 

Hills. — The mofl: remarkable hill in the neighbourhood of 
Jedburgh, is the Dunian, which is fituated partly in the pa- 
rifli of Jedburgh, and partly in that of Bedrule. Its eleva- 
tion above the level of the fea is 1024 feet. The ridge of 
hifls on the fouth fide of the parifh of Jedburgh, contiguous 
to the Englifh border, is conflderably higher, but arifkig from 
an elevated bafe, the elevation is not fo ftriking. The tops of 
thefe hills are in general conical, and thofe who are attached 
to fuch ideas, are at no lofs to difcover a variety of cirgqm- 
flances favourable to the volcanic fyftsm. 

Woods. — About fifty years ago the parifli of Jedburgh a- 
bounded with wood. A fcv/ old oaks, elms, beeches, plains, 
and weeping willows ftill remain. The wood, which begins 
to rife from the old flocks upon the banks of the Jed, together 
•with a variety of new plantations, form a beautiful and ro- 
mantic 



of Jedburgh. 



i 



mantle fcene on the road from Jedburgh to Northumber- 
land. 

Caves. — Veftiges of artificial caves appear upon the 
banks of the river Jed, particularly two large caves dug 
out of the rock at Hundalee and Linthaughlee. Their di- 
menfions cannot now be afcertained, being, from the fteep- 
nefs of the rock or bank, almoft inacceffible ; but they are 
defcribed by old perfons, who have formerly entered into 
them when the accefs was lefs difficult, as confifting of three 
apartments, one on each hand of the entrance, and a larger 
one behind, which had the appearance of a great room. 
They were probably ufed as hiding places, or ftrong holds to 
flielter the inhabitants in the neighbourhood upon any fud- 
den incurfion by Englifli invaders. 

Migratory Birds. — The wood lark, bulfinch, and king's- 
filher have been frequently found on the banks of the Jed. 
The plover, fieldfare, and dotorel, abound in the fouth and hil- 
ly parts of the parifh. In the winter of 1788, during a fe. 
vere fall of fnow, a golden crefted wren made its appearance. 
The fize of it was much fmaller than the common wren ; the 
colour of the body nearly the fame ; but the head was adorn- 
ed with feathers of a beautiful orange colour and gold. 

Hiimher of HorfeSy Sheep, is'c. — There are 414 horfes in the 
parifli, and it is believed above 8000 (heep. There are fome 
black cattle and horfes bred for fale, but more for private ufe. 
A great number of cattle are bought in the autumn, and fed 
upon the foggage or after-grafs, and upon turnips. In regard 
to fheep it may be proper to obferve, that the value of wool, 
in the neighbourhood of Jedburgh, has been greatly increaf- 
ing forfeveral years paft. The white wool- in this parifla^has 

been 



^ Statl/itcnl Account 

been fold at from 1 8s. to 20s per Itone for the laft three years, 
and the wool laid with tar at 1 5s. i6s. and fome of it at 18s. 
In the lower part of the country, fome farmers in Beaumont- 
Water fold their wool laft feafon at L. 1 : 2 : o per ftone. 
Seven or eight fleeces generally go to a ftone. 

Population. — There is every reafon to believe, that the po- 
pulation of this and of the neighbouring parifhes has greatly 
diminirtied Cnce the commencement of the prefent century. 
Some years after the Union, and even when the returns were 
made to Dr. Webfter about forty years ago, the number of 
inhabitants in the parifli was fuppofcd to be about 6000. 
There is no evidence, however, of any particular enumeration 
having been made. At prefent they do not exceed half that 
number. The inhabitants of the town were numbered with 
great accuracy about fifteen years ago, and fell fliort of 2000, 
The inhabitants of the country part of the parifti do not ex- 
ceed 800 ; and there are only two or three villages contain- 
ing about 100 fouls. The veftiges of uninhabited houfes are 
to be feen both in the town and in the country. This de- 
creafe is partly to be attributed to the Union between the 
two kingdoms, by which the trade of Jedburgh was, in a great 
meafure, ruined, and the population of the town diminilhed 
of confequence ; and partly to the union of farms, which has 
(depopulated the country. 

EffeEis of the Union on the Borders. — The Union of the Par- 
liaments of England and Scotland, has in fome refpects pro- 
duced an effedl very different from what might have been 
expefled from it. Inftead of promoting the increafe, it has 
contributed to the diminution, of the people upon the Bor- 
deis Befides, the influence of various natural propenfities, 
which induced men to flock to the fcene where adtive talents 

were 



»f Jedburghi 



were conftantly employed, honour acquired, and the ftrong- 
cft national antipathies gratified, there were obvious confider- 
ations of intereft, which rendered the fituation of the Borders 
more eligible, after violence and hoftility were reprefled, by 
the union of the two Crowns, and the confequent interpofi- 
tion of the legiflature of both kingdoms. The inhabitants of 
the Borders, while the taxes and the commercial regulations 
of the two kingdoms were different, enjoyed the opportunity 
of carrying on a very advantageous contraband trade, without 
danger to their perfons or fortunes. Into England they im- 
ported, fait, fkins, and malt, which, till the Union, paid no 
duties in Scotland ; and from England they carried back 
wool, which was exported from the Frith of Forth to France, 
with great profit. The veftiges of forty malt-barns and 
kilns are now to be feen in the town of Jedburgh, 
while at prefent there are only three in aftual occupation ; 
and the corporation of Ikinners and glovers, formerly the 
moft wealthy in that town, have, fince the Union, greatly di- 
mlnilKed, both in regard to opulence and number. The pro- 
prietors of eftates upon the Borders were well aware of the 
detriment which their property would fufFer by the incorpo- 
rating Union, and in general ftrenuoully oppofed it ; and the 
commiflioners for carrying on that treaty, were fo fenfible of 
the lofs they would fuftain, that they agreed to appro- 
priate part of the equivalent money, as it was called, to their 
indemnification and benefit *. 

The Union has alfo been the caufe of the depopulation of 
the Border country, by enlarging the fphere, and facilitating 
the means of emigration. While the two countries were in 

a 



* See Defects Hlftory of the Union, minute 47. obfervation 



Stati/ftcal Accouni 



a hoftile ftatc, there was neither inducement nor opportunity 
to move from the one to the other. The Inhabitants often 
made ioroads upon one another ; but when the incurfion was 
over, they returned to their own homes. Their antipathy and 
refentments were a rampart which excluded all foclal inter- 
courfe, and mixture of inhabitants. In this fituation, mifcon- 
duft and infamy at home were the only motives to emigration, 
and while this was the cafe, the exchange of inhabitants would 
be nearly at a par : But after the Union of the two kingdoms, 
and the decline or extindlion of national antipathies, the ba- 
lance arifiing from the interchange of inhabitants would run 
much in favour of the more wealthy country. Artificers 
and labourers would naturally refort where wages were high- 
er, and all the accommodations of life were more plentiful, 
efpecialiy if this could be effected without the unpleafing 
idea of relinquifliing home. To pafs from the Borders of 
Scotland into Northumberland, was rather like going into a» 
nother parifli than into another kingdom. 

Union of Farms. — The monopoly of farms, or the conjoin- 
ing a number of fmall poiTeffions into one, has long been 
prevalent in this part of the kingdom. There are inftances 
in this, and in the neighbouring parifties, of individuals 
renting and farming lands formerly poffefled by fix, eight, or 
ten tenants; and there are inftances, particularly of flaeep 
farmers, holding two, or three farms in diftant parts of 
the country, each of which was formerly confidered as fuffi- 
ciently large and extenfive for one perfon. On the whole, 
this has not perhaps contributed to make the condition of the 
lower ranks of people worfe, nor to diminifli the population 
of the kingdom at large, though it certainly has had the ef- 
fe(Sl of reducing the number of the inhabitants in every diftrift 
where fuch a junction has taken place.

BlrthSf Deaths, and Marriages. — ^The number of births 
within the parifli of Jedburgh exceed 90 per annum. The 
burials in the parlfli church amount, at an average of three 
years, only to 49 ; but then, fome families, in the country 
part of the parifh, continue to bury in an old chapel ground, 
five miles fouth of Jedburgh, and ftveral in the church- 
yards of Oxnam and Southdean ; fo that no certain concKi" 
lion can be formed upon this article. The number of mar- 
riages, at an average for the laft three years, amounts only to 
22 ; but it muft be obferved, that there are many irregular 
inarriages in this pariih and neighbourhood. 

Rent of the Part/h. — The valued rent of the parllK is 
L. 23,264 : 6 : 10 Scots; the real rent, probably, above L. 70CO 
Sterling. The rent of the land varies. Sheep farms let from 
3 s. 6 d. to 5 s. per acre. Some arable farms at the rate of 
los. 15 s. and even 20s. Land in the immediate ucigh- 
bourhood of the town of Jedburgh, at from L. 2 to L. 3. 
Houfes, in the town, from los. to L. 15 fer annum. 

Number of Proprietors, Tenants, Ijfc. — There are fixtecn 
greater, and a confidcrable number (about a hundred) of 
fmaller proprietors, called here Portioners^ from their having 
a fmall portion of land belonging to them. Of the greater 
proprietors, eight, either occafionally, or conftantly, refidc 
in the parifli. There are two farmers who pay above L. 300 
per annum ! three who pay above L. 200; about fourteen 
who rent above L. 100; and a number of fmaller tenants. 
There are three phyficians, three furgeons, and ten writers, 
or attorneys. 



Crops. — ^Thc principal crops in the parifli, are oats and 
barley. Of late years, a confiderable quantity of wheat is

fown in the ground immediately furroundlng the town of 
Jedbufgh, and fome on Tiviot fide } but little or none in the 
fouth part of the parifli. Turnips and potatoes are a gene- 
ral crop all over this country. The culture of turnips, in 
particular, has been much lludied, and is greatly extended 5, 
every farmer laying out a great portion of his land in 
them. The foil of this country is believed to be more fuit- 
able to the growth of turnips, than that of any other part of 
Scotland'. Formerly they were accuftomed to feed cattle, in 
the houfe, with turnips ; but it is now found more profitable, 
and has become more frequent, to let the fheep eat them in 
the fields. It may be proper to obferve, that, from the ex- 
perience of fome of the moft fkilful farmers, calves and ftieep- 
hogs may be fed, with great profit and fafety, upon turnips i 
and that young beafts fed on turnips attain the fame fize and 
value, at two years old, that they formerly did at three, when 
fed on grafs. It was formerly a common prejudice in this 
country, and fiill prevails in other pl^pes^ that turnips were 
poxious to young animals. 

A confiderable quantity of peafe, a few beans, a great quan- 
tity of clover and rye-grafs, are fown in this parifii ; but little 
flax or hemp excepting fome for private ufe. Oats are fown 
from the beginning of March to the end of April. Early 
oats have been much ufed of l^te, and are found to be a great 
improvement. The barley is fown from the middle of April 
to the end of May : The turnips from the beginning of June 
to the middle of July : The greater portion, I believe, in 
drills. Some wheat is fown in September, but more in Oc- 
tober. The wheat is generally fown after potatoes, or fal- 
low, the barley, and grafs feeds, after turnips; oats upon 
ley, or after fallow, or pairing and burning. A greater quan- 
tity of every ipecies of graon, |han what is ncceflary for th(j

maintenance of its inhabitants, is raifed within the bounds of 
this parifh. There may, perhaps, be feme doubt with refped^ 
to wheat but it is certain that oats, and oat-meal, are ex* 
ported in confiderable quantities to Lothian and Tweedale, 

Orchards A great quantity of pears gfoxfr in the gardens 

or orchards of the town of Jedburgh. The trees, though 
very old, are remarkably fruitful ; and it is calculated that 
the value of the fruit amounts, at a medium, to about L. 30© 
ptr annum. 

Ecclefiqflical State of the Pari/}. — There are forlr clergymen , 
'm the town of Jedburgh ; the miriifter of the Eftabliihed 
Church, of the Relief congregation, of the Burgher, and tha 
Antiburgher, feceders. Their rcfpedlive examination rolls are 
as follows : Eftabliihed Church 800 ; Relief congregation 
1 200 ; Burgher congregation 600 ; Antiburgher 1 50. Total 
2750 examinable perfons ; that is, perfons from fiX to feven 
years old, and upwards. In order to account for the great pro- 
portion of diflenters, it muft be obferved, that the fc6l called 
the Relief Congregation had its origin in Jedburgh. In the 
year I75S council, and the generality of the inhabitants 
of the town, applied for a prefentation to Mr Bofton, mini- 
fter of Oxnam, and being difappointed in that application^ 
built a large meeting-houfe, by contribution, and invited Mr 
Bofton to be their minifter ; feveral of the moft fubftantial 
members of the congregation binding thcmfelves to pay him 
L. 1 20 per annum. He accepted of their call ; and prevailed 
upon Mr Gillefpie, who had been depofed for difobedience 
to the orders of the General AlTembly, to join him, under 
the denomination of the Prefbytery of Relief ; profefling to 
ditFer from the Eftablifhed Church upon no other point, than

tions of the people. This fen-, more accommodating to the 
fpirit of the times, have quickly fpread over Scotland, and, 
probably, comprehend the grcatefl: part of the Scotch 
diffenters. Near a half of all the families in the parifti of 
Jedburgh, and a great proportion of the families in all the 
furrounding pariflies, are members of this congregation. 
There are not more than five or fix who profefs the Epifco- 
pal religion, and there are no Catholics, in the parifh. 

The prefent incumbent, Dr. Thomas Somerville, was ad- 
mitted minifter of Jedburgh in 1773. His predeceflbrs were 
MelTrs Semple, M'Kay, Ruet, Winchefter, Douglas, and 
M'Knight, which laft he fucceeded in the charge. He has been 
married twenty j^ears, and has two fons and four daughters. 
The King is patron of the parilh. The living confiftsof 169 
boils, half oat-meal and half barley, Linlithgow meafure; 
L. 44 in money, a manfe, and a glebe of feven Englifli acres, 
in all amounting to about L. 1^0 per annum in value. A part 
of the old Abbey Church is ftill ufed as the place of wor- 
fhip. The manfe was built about 60 years ago, and has of- 
ten been repaired at a great expence. 

State of the Poor. — ^The number of poor upon the country 
roll of the parifii amounts to 55, and of thofe in the town 
roll to 37. They are maintained by aflelTiuents. For fup- 
porting the county poor, a lax is laid upon the different pro- 
priet jj/b of land, in proportion to the valued rents. The 
common method of proceeding in this bufinefs is as follows : 
The mir.hlsi intimates from the pulpit, that cn fuch a day a 
meeting of the heritors and elders is to be held, for the pur- 
pofd of making a proviiion for the maintenance of the poor

near the term of Cr.ndleiuas, Whitfunday, Lammas,' and 

Martinmas* 



^ Jedburgh,

Martinmas. Upon the day of meeting the heritors ele£l: a 
prefes, after which the minutes of the former federunt, and 
the roll of the poor are read by the clerk. Forming a cal- 
culation from the number already ftanding upon the rcU, and 
the a{:plications made to them, the heritors atTefs themfelves 
in a certain fum to be coliefled from them feverally, accor- 
ding to the proportion of their valued rents. The proprie- 
tor pays one half of the aflelTment, and the tenant the other. 
Though the tenants are not mentioned in the lummons, yet 
fuch of them as chufe to attend are made welcome, and their 
advice nnd information liftened to by the meeting. Ihe 
fum aflelTcd is railed by the heritors and kirk-feiiion to- 
gether, in fuch proporticnj as feem adequate to the necefii- 
ties of the poor. Such perfor.s as are reduced to the neceCu- 
ty of applying to the heritors for charity, from any acciden- 
tal tranfient caufe, fuch as difeafe or misfortune^ receive what 
is called an interim /uppfy, i. e. a certain fum for that quarter 
only : The aged and infirm, and fuch as are likely to continue 
under the fame neceffity of depending upon public chari- 
ty, are taken upon the poors roll at a certain weekly allow- 
ance. The perfons taken upon the roll are obliged to fub- 
fcribe a bond or deed of conveyance, making over and be- 
queathing all their effefcs to the lieritors and though the 
heritors feldom cxzCi their effeiTls, yet the fubfcription of the 
bond ferves as a check to prevent perfons, who may be pot 
ftiTed of concealed property, from alienating the public cha- 
rity. The fum afleffed is levied by a 'colk£lor, appointed by 
the heritors, and diftributed by him to the perfons admitted 
upon the roll, according to the proportions allotted to them. 
This mode of providing for the parochial poor was adopted 
in the parifh of Jedburgh anno 1 742, when the number of 
the poor increafing, from the fcarcity and high price of pro- 
vifions, the heritors and kirk-feflxon ^ere obliged to have re^

courfe to the legal method of obtaining the contributions tit 
abfent proprietors. Thefe monthly alTeflments have varied 
from two fliillings to three {hillings and fix-pence /tfr quarter, 
en each hundred pounds of valued rent. The aflelTment for 
the laft twelve months viras at the rate of three (hillings per 
quarter, but did not produce the fum required, viz. L. 37 : 8 : 8 
per quarter. The deficiency is made up from the weekly col- 
lections. 

The poor belonging to the borough of Jedburgh, are pro- 
vided for by a plan in fome refpe£ts fimilar to, but ia 
others materially different from, that above defcribed. The 
magiftrates hold quarterly meetings, in which they aflefs the 
borough for the maintenance of their poor, and portion the 
fums in the fame manner as the heritors do ; but the aflefl^ 
ment is not proportioned to the value of the property of in- 
dividuals within the royalty ; but according to a valuation of 
the property of the burgeflTes and inhabitants, eftimated by 
fworn • afleflbrs appointed by the magiftrates. The afleflbrt, 
in forming their calculation, and fixing the portion of aflcfl^ 
ment to which each individual is liable, have refpe£t not only 
to oftenfible property, but to the profits of trade, and other 
fuppofed advantages. It is obvious that fuch a vague and ar- 
bitrary mode of calculation, is extremely liable to partiality 
and error. 

The fums appropriated for the maintenance of each indi- 
vidual vary, according to the circumftances of tiie claimant. 
To fingle perfons who can do no work, a fhilling, one (hil- 
ling and fix-pence, one (hilling and eight-peace is allowed 
weekly. Six-pence, eight-pence, ten-pence to thofe who arc 
infirm and receive fmall wages. Eight, ten, twelve, and 
fometimes twenty (hillings per quarter hare been allowed for

latcrlm fupply. There are few inftances of any family re- 
ceiving above two (hillings, or two (hillings and fix-pence Z)^** 
week. Thcfe proportions refer to the poor belonging to the 
country part of the parilh } but the allowance given to the 
poor of the town is more fcanty and inadequate. 

Befides the aflelTments above-mentioned, the town of Jed- 
burgh holds the principal fum of L. 422 upon bond to the 
feffion, arifing from the accumulation of various legacies, the 
intereft of which is annually diftributed according to the deC* 
tination of the donors : Some of it for educating poor chil- 
dren, fome for the relief of poor houfeholders, fome appro- 
priated to the poor within the town, and fome to the poor 
of the town and country equally. A great portion of thefe 
charities arifes from legacies of the Lady Yefter, who was 
the daughter of Kerr of Fairnyherft in this parifh, and ce- 
lebrated for her charity. A bridewell or correftion-houfc 
has been lately erefted in the town, at the ex pence of the he- 
ritors of the county at large, and has been found very ufeful 
in overawing vagrants, punilhing fmaller offences, and, par- 
ticularly, for the accommodation of perfons difordered in 
mind, who are maintained there at the cxpence of the pa- 
yifhes to which they belong. 

Language. — The common people in the neighbourhood of 
Jedburgh pronounce many word^, particularly fuch as end in 
a guttural found, with a remarkable broad, and even harfh 
accent. They ftill make ufe of the old ocotch dialeft. Many 
of the names of places, however, are evidently derived from 
the Erfe, and expreflive of their local fituation in that lan- 
guage. For inflance, — Dunian, John's Hi /I j — ^Minto, Kid's 
Hill; — Hawick, Village on a Riven — Ancrum, anciently call- 
ed AInicromb} a Crook in the River; ice. &amp;c.

Matwers and Morals of the Peof/e.— -There is rather a want 
©f induftry in the town of Jedburgh, owing to the deftruc- 
tive Influence of borough politics but to this rule there are 
many exceptions ; and the common labourers in the country 
are remarkable for the quantity of work which they perform. 
In general, it may be obferved, that al! ranks of people live 
more foberly, and are lefs addifted to drinking, than they 
were fome years ago ; and that perfons in a better fituatlon 
are charitably difpofed, and were particularly liberal in their 
contributions for the relief of the poor, after the unfortunate 
fcafon of 1782. Crimes are becoming every day more rare. 
Only one inftance of fuicide has occurred for thefe 1 7 years 
paft ; and no inhabitant of the parifh has been bani(hed for 
thefe many years. Five have fuff'ered capital punifliments j 
but not one of them for murder. It is, indeed, one of the 
moft ftriking evidences of the progrefs of civilization, and one 
of the moft pleafing effeds of a regular government, that in a 
country, formerly the fcene of depredating violence, fewer 
inftances of crimes, or of punifhments, have occurred during 
the laft 50 years, than perhaps in any other diftricl of equal 
extent in the kingdom. 

Advantages ajd Difadvantages. — ^The principal difadvantage 
under which this parifla labours, is its great diftance from 
eoal, which is found to be the cheapeft fewel, though there 
arc feveral large peat molTes in many parts of the neighbour- 
hood. The neareft coal to Jedburgh is at Ryechetter, diftant 
about 20 miles, on the Englifli border. Some Lothian coal 
is brought by the carts which carry grain to the Dalkeith 
market, and is fold at nearly the fame price with the Englifh. 
The county, in general, and the neighbourhood of Jedburgh 
in particular, is likely to derive great advantage from the im- 
provement and extenfion of roads, which does great honoiu-

to the aftlvity and public fpirit of the gentlemen who have 
promoted them. There is a turnpike road now carried from 
Jedburgh to Newcaftle, which fhortens tlie diftance from 
thence to Edinburgh conllderably ; and there is at prefent a 
profpeft of carrying one, in a dired line, from Jedburgh to 
Boroughbridge in Yorkfliire, which could not fail of being 
frequented, as it would render the road between London and 
Edinburgh nearer by 38 miles than by Berwick.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20027860">HOLY WOOD, 
    IN DUMFRIES. SHIRE.</name> 

Fram Mdienals furnlfoed by the Rev. Dr. Brtce JoHNSTON, 
Minifter of that Parijh.</head> 
<p>


Origin of the Name. 

HOlywood is evidently derived from the holy wood, 
or grove of oak trees, which furrounded a large Drui- 
dical temple, fhill ftanding, within half a mile of the parifh 
church. It is formed of twelve very large whin or moor 
ftones, as they are called, which inclofe a circular piece of 
ground of about eighty yards in diameter. The oaks have 
now alt perifhed ; but there is a tradition of their exifting in 
the laft age. Many of their roots have been dug out of the 
ground by the prelent minilter; and he has ftill one of themi 
in his poirelfion. 

Situation t Extent ^ and Surface. — The parifh lies in the divlfion 
of the county of Dumfries called Nithfdale, in the Prefbytery 
and Synod of Dumfries. It is about ten Englifh miles long, 
and one and an half broad, on an average. It is bounded by 
the parifh of Dumfries on the eaft; by Terrcgles, Kirkpatrick- 
Irongray, and Kirkpatrick-Durham, on the fouth ; by a fmall 
part of Glencairn, and by a large track of Dunfcore, on the 
weft and north ; and by Kirkmalioe on the north-caft. Be- 
ing 



of Holywood^ 35 

ing fituatcd in the middle of a broad valley, It is in general 
flat and low land. The hills in the paridi are neither high 
nor rocky. 

Rivers. — The river Nitli runs along the whole of the eaft end 
of the parifli, interfeft:ing it, however, in one place for above 
a mile in length. The river Cluden, alfo a couliderable one, 
runs along the fouth lide of the parilh above eight mdes, and 
interfedls it in three places, emptying itfelf into the Nith in 
the fouth-eaft corner of the parifli, near the old College oi' 
Provoftry of Lincluden, which (lands on the Galloway fide 
of the river, in the parilh of lerregles. 

Fijh. — The Cluden abounds In fine burn trouts, a few pike 
of a middle fize, and of excellent quality, fome falaion, fomc 
fea trout, and herlings *. The Nith produces the fame kinds 
of fifli, but with this difterence, that the herlings, fea trout, 
and falmon, are much more plentiful in it than in the Clu- 
den. One peculiarity deferves particular notice : Though tl\e 
two rivers join at the fouth-eaft corner of the parilh, each 
has its own diftin*^ fpecies of falmon. The Cluden falmon 
are conllderably thicker and (horter in their bodv, and great- 
ly fliorter in their head, than thofc of the Nith. The bura 
trouts abound in the fpring and fummer ; the lierliiigs an^ 
fea trout in July and Auguft ; and the falmon from the be- 
ginning of March to the beginning of O^ftober. The falmon 
is in the greateft perfe£lion in June and July. In the fpring 
it fells for about one fliilling 3 pound of 16 ounces, and gra- 
dually 

• Herlinj^s are a fmall kind of trout, a Utile !aro;er than a 
lierring, and fhaped like a falmon; its flsfli is reddilh, like that 
of the falmon or fea trout, but confiderably paler. They abound 
in all the rivers^'in this p-^rt of the connfy, ?.nd have the name

dually decreafes in price, as the feafon advances, to 2j d. a 
pound. It is all fold in the town of Dumfries, and to the 
families in the adjacent country. Dumfries being fo near, 
and many of the fifhermen living in the town, the price in 
that market, and on the fpot where it is caught in this parifli, 
.is always the fame. The prices of the other kinds of fifh arc 
always a little lower than that of falmon ; and they rife and 
fall with it. About ten years ago, the price of fifh in this 
country was fcarccly half of what it is at prelent. The in- 
creafed price is perhaps owing, in part, to the increafed con- 
fumption, and luxury of the inhabitants, but principally to 
the great demand for this fifh, to fupply the rich and popu^ 
lous manufafluring towns in Lancafhire ; for, within thefe 
laft ten years, very confidcrable quantities of frefli falmon 
have been fent, by land carriage, into that country, from the 
Solway Frith, and the mouths of all the rivers that run into 
'it- 
Soil. — The foil of this parifh is of four different kinds, viz. 
confiderable traiSt of land, about a fourth part of the parilh, 
in the eaft, along the river Nith, and, on the fouth, for about 
feven miles up the river Cluden, is a deep rich light loam, and 
iree from ftones: 2c?, Another fourth part, contiguous to the 
former, is a light dry fertile foil, lying on a bed of fandy gra- 
vel, producing heavy crops of corn and grafs in a (howery 
feafon ; but it is greatly parched up in dry feafons : 3^/, An- 
other fourth part, which joins this laft, is a deep ftrong loam, 
interfperfed with ftones, upon a tilly bed ; it is naturally wet, 
^iff to plough, and not fo fertile as either of the two former j 
but, when drained, limed, and properly wrought, more pro- 
duflive both of corn and grafs than either of them, in 
^11 varieties of feafon, excepting only a cold and wet fummer. 
^tb. The remaining part, which is hilly, is fomewhat Cmilar

grafs, neither very fine nor very coarfe, v?hich, in feme of 
the higher parts of the hills, is mixed with heath, and a few 
other hard weeds. 

^ir, Climate, l5fc. — The air is dry, and remarkably whole- 
feme. The Angular healthinefs of the inhabitants may, how- 
ever, be attributed to the following caufes. They do not 
live in towns, or even villages ; they are not employed in fc- 
dentary occupations ; being either country gentlemen or far- 
mers, they live in houfes detached from each other ; they are 
engaged in aftive employments in the open air •, they are in- 
duftrious, fober, and chearful. The drynefs of the air is 
owing to the peculiar local fituation of the parifli. The 
clouds, intercepted by the hills on every fide, float in fogs on 
the top of them, while the inhabitants enjoy a clear and dry 
air in the valley. At other times, when the clouds break in- 
to rain on the hills, the greateft part of it falls on the hills, 
or the fides of the valley, while the Ikirts of the Ihowers only 
reach its central parts. Add to thefe circumfliances, that the 
two rapid rivers carry off the fuperfluous water from the land, 
and the moifture from the air. 

Seed-time and Harvefl. — The time of fowlng wheat Is from 
the middle of September to the middle of OiStober; oats, 
peafe, beans, hemp, and flax, from the i oth of March to the 
middle of April ; potatoes and barley f -om the middle of 
April to the loth of May ; and turnips from the loth to the 
24th rf June. The harvefl: generally begins about, or before, 
the middle of Auguft ; and the crop is got totally into the 
barns, and barn-yards, by the end of September. In cold 
j^nd wet feafons, like the lafl:, it is, however, foraewhat later. 



Mpidemical 



il* Statyiical Accounf 

Epidemical Di/ea/es, — No local diftempers, or Ccknefs of any 
kind, are prevalent in ♦he parifh. In the months of Febru- 
ary and March, indeed, fomc fevers appear among the people 
of low circumftances, efpecially in that diftrift of the parifh 
which lies in the narroweft part of the valley ; but thefe feem 
chiefly owing to poor living, and bad accommodation, during 
the winter feafon, and perhaps to the dampnefs of the pre- 
ceding months. 

ManufaElures — It was before mentioned, that there are 
neither towns nor villages in the parifh, but that the inhabi- 
tants live in detached houfes j manufactures, therefore, can- 
not well exifl in this diflridl. The deamefs of fuel is an- 
other obftacle : Peats are bad, fcarce, and confequently dear ; 
and coals are either carted 24 miles land carriage, or brought 
ifrom England by water. Thefe laft would be moderately 
cheap, were it not for the high duties laid on them, which 
are as fatal to the improvement of ftiis, as they are to many 
other parts of Scotland ; nor can this part of the country 
ever greatly improve, until thefe duties be abolifhcd. 

Population. — On the lad day of the year 1 790, there were

The great number of deaths in 1JV2, was owing to an in- 
fe£lious fever in the weft part of the pariflj, where the val- 
ley is narroweft ; and the large number in 1786, was owing 
to the ravages of the natural fmall-pox. 



Divifion of the Inhabitants^ and their Occupations. -^AXL the 
inhabitants arc farmers, and co.ttagcrs employed by them, ex- 
cept

cept thofe afterwards mentioned. About ten of the inhabi-* 
tants arc fmall proprietors of lands, which they occupy them- 
felvcs. There are eight weavers, two bleachers, two Ihoe- 
makers, two millers, five blackfmiths, five mafons, four tay- 
lors, and eight joiners ; all of whom are employed in working 
for the inhabitants of the parifli, and not in manufadluring 
articles for fale. There are no houfehold fervants except in 
gentleracns families, and thefe are few. There are about 
thirty-two male, and thirty-fix female labouring fervants. 
The greateft part of the farming and dairy work is done by 
the farmers themfelves, their wives, their fons and daughters, 
and cottagers, which laft work either by the piece, or by the 
year, receiving what is called a benefit ; that is, a houfe, 
yard, peats, 52 ftones of meal, a quantity of potatoes, and as 
much money as, with thefe articles, would, communibus annisy 
amount to thirteen pounds Sterling /i^-r Befide the 

above mentioned fervants, fome fliearers are hired by the daj 
from the adjacent n:ioor countries. It is remarkable that all the 
inhabitants arc natives of this ifland, except one perfon^only, 
who comes from Ireland. There are no nobility refident in 
in the parifti, and the gentry amount only to twenty-feven 
perfons, befidcs their domeftics. All the inhabitants are of 
the Eftablifhed Church, except fix Cameronians, nine Burgher 
Seceders, two of the Church of England, and three Catho- 
lics ; but moft of all thefe denominations attend the parifti 
church occafionally, except the Catholics. 

General CharaQer. — They are a fober, regular, and induf- 
trious people, all employed in farming, except the few above 
mentioned. They are generous and humane, although they 
hav^ not been called to the exertions of thefe qualities by any 
remarkable events, except in the years 1782 and 1783, as 
(hall be mentioned afterwards. They enjoy, in a reafonablc

degree, the conveniencies and comforts of fociety, and are in 
general as contented with their fituation as mofl- people. Their 
condition, however, might be meliorated, could the heavy mul- 
tures be removed, which hinder improvements in agriculture ; , 
or could coals be imported duty free, which checks any at- 
tempts to the cflablifhing manufadlures. With refpeiH: to the 
morals of the people. It may be obferved, that during the time 
of the prefent incumbent, which is rp years, only one perfon 
has been banifhed for thsft, and one enlifled for a foldier : 
This laft, in a few months, fol'cited his friends to make 
application to get him out of the army, which they did with 
fuccefs, and he' has ever fince lived in the parifti an induftri- 
ous labouring man. In regard to other particulars, they are 
healthy, robuft, and rather above the common ftature. Se- 
veral In fiances of longevity have been obferved among 
"them. Within thefe few years, three perfons have died, 
whofe ages were 90, 95, and ^6. 

Church, — The value of the living, including the glebe, 
about L. 120 Sterling. The la(l: patron was Robert Be- 
verldge of Fourmerkland, Efq; the proprietor of an eftate 
of that name in the parifh- He died lately, and by his 
death the patronage devolved to his fillers, the eldefl: of 
whom Is married to the Rev. Mr James McMillan miniilcr 
of Torthorwald. 

The manfe * and offices were all new built In 1773 ; the 
church In 1779; and the two Ichool houfes In 1782, all 
which buildings are now in excellent repair. 

* The parfonage houfe, thus called ail over Scotland, Is evi- 
dently derived, as manfion is, from the Latin niajieo, to renjai* 
or abide.

State of the Poor — ^The average number of poor xrho now 
receive alms is fifteen. TJie annual fura expended for their 
relief is about L. 32 Sterling, produced by the collefllons in 
the church on Sundays, excepting the intereft of a fm^U furn 
appropriated to them. Thefe fifteen per'fpns are all main- 
tained in their own houfes, or boarded in other families ; 
none of theip arc kept in hofpitals or work-houfes. The 
greateft number of them earn about two-thirds of their 
maintenance. Thofe who arc orphans under ten years 
old, or who are very old and infirm, and without re 
fations to afjift them, are boarded out at ^he rate of L. 4 
Sterling per annum. Befides the relief from the parifh, the 
poor receive frequent fupplies of food and clothes from cha- 
ritable and well difpofed people. They are however kept 
from begging from door to door moft efFeilually, by the af- 
furance of their inevitably lofing all parifh relief if they per- 
fift in the praflice. As the church feffion * is extremely at- 
tentive to give them relief, according to their neceffities, to 
provide medical affiftance for them when fick, to pay tbe 
fchoolmaf^er for teaching their children reading, writing, 
and the cotnmon rules of arithmetic, their own intereft in- 
duces them to comply with the defire of the feffion, not to 
beg. Beggars, however, ocf afionally infeft the parifh, but 
they do not belong to, nor refide in it. 

Price of Grain and Provj/tens.—l he price of wheat, barley, 
and oats, are generally regulated by the Liverpool and Gree- 
nock markets, being juft as much below the pices at thefe 
places, as will pay freight, and afford a very moderate profit 
to the corn merchants, who export the grain to one or other 

of

•f thefe places. For many years paft the price of grain 
has been in general the fame as in the London market, which 
is always a little below that of Liverpool. Grain is in ge- 
neral cheaper here about CandlemaSj the markets being 
then overftocked by the farmers anxiety to make up their 
half year's rent, which is payable at that term Commuml/us 
amis, wheat is 5s. barley 2s. 2d. and oats is lod. the Win- 
chefter buftiel. The prefent average price of beef, veal, 
mutton, lamb, and pork through the year is 3^d. the pound 
of 16 ounces, for thofe of the beft qualities. At particular 
times of the year they arc all much cheaper ; and though 
at feme periods they amount to jd. a pound, thefe dear 
times do not laft long. The price of a roafting pig is 4s. 5 
of a goofe 2S. ; of a turkey 2s. 6d. j of a duck lod. ; of a 
hen IS. ; of a chicken 3d. ; of rabbits, though there are few 
of them, IS. the pair without the fkins ; butter is pd. the pound 
of 24 ounces ; cheefe varies according to its richnefs and 
age. 

Price of Labour. — ^The wages of men labourers are is. d 
day from the ill of March to the ift of November, and lod. 
the rell of the year, except that in time of harveft they are 
13d. ; and of inovving, i8d. The wages of women are, fof 
working at peats, 8d, ; at turnip weeding, hay making, 
and other farm work in fummer, 7d. ; fliearing in harvelt 
13d. Both men and women, furnifh their own proviCons 
out of their wages. The day wages of a carpenter and a ma- 
fon arc is. 8d. ; of a bricklayer and flater 2s. j • of a tay- 

lor, 

• The wages of thefe four artifts were 2d. lefs before the year 
1788 ; at that time an uncommon fpirit for building appealing 
in the country, increafed the demand for labour of that kind. 
This fpirit proceeded from the general tafte for good houfes, which 
ftiarks this period, and from many monied inen, who, having 
pBichafed eftttes in this part of the country, are building cle-

lor, IS. without, br 6d. with meat. Work, however, 'is gc- 
nerally done by the piece. The average of farm fervants, 
when they eat in the houfe, is L. 7 for men, and L. 3 for 
women ; but the farm fervants are generally paid by what is 
called a benefit, before defcribed ; and if the man's wife and 
children are employed by the farmer, their work is feparately 
paid for. The wages of domeflic fervants are nearly the 
fame with thofe of farm fervants. 

Expences of a Labourer's Family. The expences of a com- 
mon labourer, when married, and with four or five children, 
is about L. 1 6 a year. The wages which he receives, toge- 
ther with the induftry of his wife, enable him to live tole- 
rably comfortable, and to give his children an education pro- 
per for their ftation, provided he and his wife are fober, in- 
duftrious, and frugal : Thofe of them who are embarrafled 
in their circumftances, owe their poverty either to their own, 
or their wife's bad conduft. That the labourers can maintain 
their families at this fmall expence, is owing to the farmers, 
from whom they have cottages, allowing them as much land 
for one year's rent free, to plant potatoes in, as they can ma- 
nure fufficicntly with afhes, or fuch dung as they can provide 
for themfclves ; and thefe potatoes conftitute at leaft one half 
of their year's food. 

Divifion am] Rent of Lands. — A great part of the parifli is 
indofed, but a confiderable part ftill lies open. The farmers 
feem fufficiently convinced of the advantages of inclofing, 
and would willingly allow their landlords intereft for fuch 
fums of money as would be neceflary for making inclofures. 

The 

gant manfion-houfcs for themfelves, and good farm-houfes for 
their tenants. 



The farms are in general from L. 40 to L. 150 a year ; but 
there are fome few from L. 40, down to as fmall as L 8. 
About the year 177 i a fpir it of improvement appeared in 
the parifli, when the farms became larger than they had for- 
merly been but for fome years pafl: they have continued 
nearly of the fame lize. The bell arable hnd is let Irom 
L. 1 : I : o to L. I : 10 : o ; and the inferior, f; o:n 20s. to 7s. 
an acre. The hill pafture is not let by the acre, but by the 
lump. The whole rent of the pari{h amounts to for^iethmg 
more than L. 300c Sterling per annum., including houfes, 
and the fmall fiflicries in the Nith and Cluden. The heri- 
tors are thirty- one in number, of whom ten of the Imall 
ones and" three of the largeft refide in the parifh. There is 
no m:'.p of the parifh, the number of acres in it have not 
confequcntly been precifely afcertained; they are eftimated 
at about 7500. Of thefe about 60 are employed for raifing 
wheat, 250 for barley, 20 for peafc and bean;, lo for rye, 
1310 for oats, 10c for potatoes, 30 for turnip and cabbage, 
20 for flax and hemp, 500 for fown grafs, the reft is paftu- 
rage, except about 150 acres for roads and plantations. None 
of the ground is common ; and every proprietor knows the 
exaft marches of his eftate ; but a confiderable quantity of the 
hilly part muft always lie in a ftate of pafturage, not being 
arable on account of the ftcepnefs of the hills. Several 
hundred acres, however, of the lower parts of thefe un- 
broken grounds, are capable of cultivation, and, if proper- 
ly improved, woult^ pay well for the labour beftowed on 
them. The greateft part of the parifli is thirled * to ths 

mill 

* When the laird, e. lord of the manor, builds a mill, he 
obliges his tenants to have all their corn giounJ ;U that mill 
only. The farms are then laid to be thirled, or under thirlage 
to the mill. But fometimes, as is the cafe here, the tenants of 
one eilate are thirled to the mill of another, which, when the 
dues are high, is a great bar to improvement.

mill of Cludcn, and pays a very high multure *, which greatly 
tends to retard the cuhivation and improvement of the 
diftria. 

Mcde of Culiival'ton. —There are 70 ploughs in the parifh. 
Thofe ufed in the firft divifion, fee p. 20. and the greateft part 
of the fecond, viz. the light foil, are the fmall Lnglifli 
plough ; in part of the fecond, and adjoining part of the third, 
they ufe the Scots plough with the Englifti mould-board, 
or ploughs compofed partly on the model of the old ^cots, 
and partly on that of the Englifti ; and in the remaining part 
of the third, the Scots plough only is ufed. Jilach of thefe 
ploughs feems well adapted for the nature of the foil in the 
diftridt where they are ufed. The Englifh plough is cer- 
tainly the beft, but it can only work properly in land that 
is free from ftones. The Scots plough, when properly made, 
is doubtlels the fitteft for ftrong land ; and, laftly, the plough 
compofed of tiie two, is the moft proper for land that is 
compofed of the two kinds above mentioned ; and thefe are 
the nature of the different foils in which the feveral kinds of 
ploughs are ufed. The ploughs arc commonly drawn by two 
ftrong horfes, and one man both holds the plough and drives 
the horfes, with a pair of long reins. When ftiff land is to 
be broken up from grafs, three, or fometimes four horfes are 
yoked into a plough of the fame conftrudtion, but of a ftrong- 
cr make. 

Produce. — The vegetable produce of this parifh has already 
been fpecified, under the article, Dtvlftort of Land. With re- 
fpedl to animal produdtions, it is principally diftinguifhed for a 
breed of black cattle, for which the county of Drumfries in 

general 

• Multure is a certain ftipulated quantity of meal, given a$ 
payment to the miller for grinding the corn : And all corH 
grown on farms thirled to the mill is obliged to pay multure, 
whether the corn be ground at that mill or elfewhere^

general, and tKc neighbouring counties of the ftewartry and 
the county of Galloway are alfo famous. They are very profit- 
able for fattening, and many thoufands of them are annually 
fold and fent into England. They are handfome, of a mid- 
dle fize, and weigh well for their height. When fat for the 
butcher, the four quarters weigh at an average 36 ftones of 16 
pounds ; but feveral of them amount to 60 or 70 ftones. The 
plumber of black cattle in the whole parifh amounts to about 
l?OQ. The fheep, which are kept in the hilly part of the 
parifli, are the common Scots fheep, white on the body, but 
black on the face and legs ; they are very hardy and their 
wool is ftrong and fliaggy, but coarfe. In the low cultivated 
diftri£ls there are two kinds of Englifh fheep, the one long 
bodied and long legged, introduced into this country by Cul- 
ley, they are commonly known by the name of Muggs ; the 
other is alfo long bodied, but broad backed and fhort legged, 
introduced by Bakewell. They are both all white, body, 
face, and legs : Both of them have much finer wool, and a% 
larger quantity of itf^ than the Scots fheep. Bakewell's kind 
have the fineft fliort wool. From an experiment lately tried, 
a crofs between the two breeds feems to anfwer well ; viz. 
the ram of the Culley, the ewe of the Bakewell breed. In 
this cultivated diftrift and mild fllmate, the Englifh are prefer- 
red to the Scots fheep, on account of the greater quantity, 
and finer quality, of the wool their being lefs hurtful to the 
'Jicdges ; at^d their greater weight when fold to the butcher. 
The whole npmber of fheep in the parifh, amounts at prefent 
only to about 1000. 

The produce of tjhe diflrlfl is, pn the whole, much greater 
tlian fqfficient for theconfumptiou of the inhabitants. About 
two thirds of the whole is carried to markets out of the parifh, 
vi?. a coniidcrable quantity of butter, milk, veal, mutton.

beef, wheat, oat-meal, and barley, to Dumfries; a. large 
quantity of wheat and barley to Whitehaven and Liverpool ; 
of oats to Greenock and a great number of young black 
cattle and fheep to the towns in the neighbourhood. 

There are hares, and feme foxes, and all the fowls which 
are natives of the fouth part of Scotland. The migratory 
birds are the fwallow, and the cuckow. During the whole 
year the fea gulls, commonly called, in this parifh, fea maws, 
occafionally come from the Solway Frith to this part of the 
country ; their arrival feldom fails of being followed by 
a high wind, and heavy rain, from the fouth-weft, within 
twenty-four hours; and they return to the Frith again as 
foon as the ftorm begins to abate. 

Roads a fid Bridges. — The roads were originally made by 
the ftatute labour ; but in that way they were neither half 
^lade, nor half kept in repair. Several years ago, an afb of 
parliament was obtained for this county, converting the fra- 
tute labour into money, to be paid by the occupiers of land, 
at a rate not exceeding 12 s. in the 100 merks of Scotch va- 
luation, and a certain fum to be paid by the pofleffors of 
houfes in towns and villages. In fome diftrl^Tts of the coun- 
ty, where making the roads is expenfive, the occupiers 
of land have been aiTefTed to the tdtlmuvt ; but in this, and 
fome others, the afTefTment has never been more than 6 s. 
for each 1 00 merks. The converfion money is very well 
laid out in this parifli. The roads are put, and kept, in as 
good repair as the fum coUefled can poffibly do ; but, as the 
roads are extenfive, and, as there is a thoroughfeir through 
the parifli, from a large and populous furrounding country, 
to the markets at Dumfries, this fum is too fmall to keep 
the roads in fufficient repair ; and it would probably be cheap- 
er. 



9f Holyivood* 



33 



er, in the end, to lay on the full afleirment of 12 s. for a few 
years, till all the roads are completely finiflied, and then to 
reduce the affeffment to 4 s. which would be iufficient for 
keeping them in repair. Left the prefent tenants Ihould be 
aggrieved by paying 12 s. while their fuccelTors, who would 
enjoy the benefit of good roads, pay only 4 s. the landlords 
fliould pay the additional 6 s. and receive it afterwards from 
the fubfequent tenants at 2 s. a year, till the landlords be re- 
imburled. A great turnpike road is now making between 
Carlifle and Glafgow, which runs through the parjlh. It 
will be completely finiflaed in this county before, or about the 
beginning of May next. The tolls upon it are moderate, 
and will be fully Iufficient for making and repairing it. This 
road, like all other turnpikes under proper management, 
muft be highly advantageous to the country. The bridges 
in the parifh are good. The only large one in it was ori- 
ginally built, and is ftill kept in repair, by the county of 
Dumfries and ftewartry of Galloway, as it is built over the 
Cluden, which is the march between the two counties. The 
fmaller ones, being all within the parilh, were built, and are 
kept In repair, by the parifli. 

Antiquities. — There are no other remains of antiquity than 
the Druidical temple already mentioned, and two old houfes 
built in the tower faihion. There is one large heap of fmall 
{tones, a part of which was opened feveral years ago, and 
fome human bones faid to have been found in it. The Abbey 
of Holywood flood in the fite of 3 part of the prefent church- 
yard. About half of the head of the crofs of this abbey was 
ftanding in the year 1779, when it ferred for the parifli 
church. Thefe remains, however, were then pulled down^ 
and the materials ufed, in part, for building the prefent new 
church. The veftiges of the old abbey are fuSIcientiy evi-

dent in the church-yard; and the adjoining farm retains fhs 
name of Abbey. The prelent church has two fine toned bells, 
taken out of the old building ; one of which, by an inlcrip- 
tion and date on it, appears to have been confecrated by the 
Abbot John Wrich, in the year 1 154. From undoubted re- 
cords, this abbey belonged to the monks of the order of 
Premontre, which was inftituted in the diocefe of Loon in 
France, in the year 11 20, and was fo called, becaafe, as the 
monks fay, the place was *' divina revelatione praemonftra- 
" turn." 

Etymology of Names of Places. — The names of places m this 
parifh feem to be derived partly from the Gaelic, and partly 
from the Englifh, and fome from the Danifh. The names 
derived from the Englifli are either expreffive of the parti- 
cular fituation of the places, or of the proprietor to whom 
they originally belonged. Thus Broomrigy fituated on a ridge 
that produces much broom ; Gooliehill, lituated on a rifing 
ground producing much gool * ; Mofsfide^ fituated on the fide 
of a mofs ; Siepfordy fituated at a ford in the Gluden where 
foot pafungers crofs the water on ftepping ftoncs, that have 
been placed there time immemorial; Alorinton, the town of 
Morlne ; Steivarton, the town of Stewart, &amp;c. Holm, derived 
from the Danifh, in which language holm fignifies an ifland. 
From the Gaelic are moft probably derived Speddock, Barfreg' 
gan, Glengaber, Glengaur, M''Whamikh^ &amp;c. Killnefs feems 
to be compounded of two languages, cella, the Latin for ?, 
chapel or cell, and nefs, or naes, the Danifh for a promontory, 
or head land, (it may alfo be derived from the Latin 
Killnefs fignifying the chapel or cell on the promontory : The 

place 

* GooL Dr Johnfton fays, is a weed with a yellow flower, which 
jrnw- imon?; the corn, on light lands, in wet feafons, aboi.t

^ace fo called is the field where the Druidical temple above 
mentioned ftands, and it is prominent into the river Cluden. 

Eminent Men Natives of the P^r-y7j.— Holywood has pro- 
duced no men of eminence in learning or ftience, except Mr 
Charles Irvine furgeon. He was a younger fon of the late 
William Irvine of Gribton Efq; and the perfon who, feveral 
years ago, difcovered the method of rendering fait water frefli, 
for which he was rewarded by government with a grant of 
five thoufand pounds. 

Mifcellaneous Ohfervations . — The hnrvefts of 1782, and 
1783, were very late, efpecially that of 1782. Before the 
corn Wiis all cut in this part of the country, there were in- 
tenfe frofts and heavy fnov/s. On the 2d of November 1782, 
in particular, a very heavy fall of fnow covered the corn fo 
deep, and lay fo long, that they could not be cut for feveral 
days after. Thougti the harveft was uncommonly late in 
this parifli in thefe two years, and though the lateft of the 
corn in it was hu: t by the froft, yet the harveft here was 
earlier than in any other part of Scotland j and the greateft 
part of the corn was ripened before the frolts came on. Under 
all thefe untoward circumftances, the crops of thefe years were, 
however, uncommonly good, as is the cafe, not only this year, 
but alfo in all late years, owing to the peculiar drynefs and ear- 
linefs of the foil and climate of this parifli. The general fcarcity 
of meal in Scotland during thefe two years, and the great de- 
mand for feed corn from thofe counties where the frofts had 
deftroyed the crops, greatly increafed, as is well remembered, 
the price of meal and oats all over Scotland. At that time 
the farmers of this parifli had large quantities of both, eipe- 
cially of feed corn, to fell ; and they cleared by it in thofe 
two years, more than they ever did in any otl;er two years.

The price of oat-meal was then 2 s. 6 d. the ftone of 17I 
pounds; higher than w?? ever known before or fince. In 
this parifn the heritors and farmers, by a voluntary contri- 
bution, collected into two ftore-houfes, one at each extremi- 
ty of the parifh, all the meal they could, and diftributed 
k among the poor labourers and artificers at 2 s. a ftone, un- 
til it fell in the markets to that price ; and by thus lofing 6d. 
a ftone in the meal which they fold, they were the happy 
means of preferving their poor parifhioners from the general 
calamity of the country.

<p>
Origi; of the Name, 

PORTPATRICK is called in the old charters Port Mont- 
gomery, from a noble family of that name, who at one 
time polTeffed large trails of land on both fides of the Irifli 
Channel. They were ennobled by the title of Earl Mount- 
Alexander, which became extindt in 1758. They have now 
none of their Scots polTeflions remaining, but their reprefcn- 
tatives ftill inherit a confiderable eftate in Ireland. 

It is probable that Portpatrick was the antient popular 
name of this place, and that the above family, when they be- 
came the proprietors, had attempted to fet it afide, and to 
fubftitute their own. This is one of the many monuments 
■which prove, that in antient times there flourifhed in Ireland 
a very eminent perfon of the name of Patrick. The vene- 
ration for this name muft have been very great, fince, even 
on this fide of the water, it has prevailed over that of 
Montgomery.

Siatijlical Account 

Siiuaiten and Surface. — 1 he fituation of the town and pa- 
rlfh is well known, being the ncareft point of the whole 
ifland of Great Britain to Ireland, and the beft place for 
crofling from the one kingdom to the other, the pafTage be- 
ing only twenty miles over. It is fituated in the prefbytery 
of Stranraer and county of Wigton- The parifh is of fmall 
extent, being only about three Scots miles Iquare. The greater 
part is moor land, and it abounds with moflls, not on.y in the 
lower grounds, but even on the tops of feme of the higheft 
mountains, where the mofs is frequently fix or feven feet 
deep. The common fuel is peat, which is in Juch quantities, 
that from thirty to forty carts, drawn by two horfes each, 
are regularly employed during the fummer fecfon in bringing 
peats to the neighbouring towns of Portpatrlck and Stranraer. 

Town of Portpnfr'.ch. — The to';vn is admirably fituated. It 
enjoys a fouthern expofure, with a femicircle of hiils on the 
north, which at the fame time defends it from all the 
cold winds, and concentrates the rays of the fun, fo that few 
places in the fame latitude can boafi: of a warmer climate. 
The common water which pours from the hills is excellent ; 
and there is a mineral well, which has been found of fervice 
in common, but particularly in ftomachic diforders. But above 
all, the fea bathing is admirable. The water is peculiarly 
ftrong, and the tide rifes to fuch a height clofe to the fhore, 
that a man, as well as a veffel, may be inftantly launched into 
any depth he pleafes. In fliort, no fituation can be better 
calculated for a watering place, fhould the rage for them con- 
tinue to prevail as generally as at prefent. 

The Harbour. — Formerly the harbour was a mere inlet be- 
twerr, two ridges of rocks which advanrrd into the fea ; the 
efFett of this was, that as there is a prodigious weight of wa- 
ters 



Of Portpatrick, 



Icrs thfown in here when the wind blows upon the fhore, 
and as there was no elbow to protect a veffel, ftie was always 
obliged, when flie took the harbour, to run aground ; and the 
next operation, which neceflarily followed, was, that the 
whole inhabitants, men and women, ran down, ana uy main 
force, dragged her up the beach, out of the reach of the 
waves, which would otherwife have dafhed her to pieces. 
This again had another cfifedl, that none but flat bottomed 
veflcls could navigate here. It is but lately that two of thefe 
large flats, which had formerly been government packets, 
were to be feen on our fliore, as monuments of antient bar- 
barity. 

Thefe were times of mifery, though the inhabitants were 
the happieft of mortals. Their continued exertions in 
launching and drawing up their veflels, excited wonderful 
fpirits, which they knew how to recruit when cxhaufted. 
Every day that a velTel either failed or arrived was a feftival. 

There is now on the fame fpot one of the fineft quays ia 
Britain, with a refleifting light-houfe ; and inftead of a few 
flat-bottomed boats, above a dozen of trading veflels, of frora 
40 to 60 tons, which fail and return regularly, befides a num- 
ber of vcflTels which occafionally come from other ports. 
The larger veflTels are navigated at an average by fix men 
each *. The light houfe is particularly uleful, and as there

has long been another Lght-houfe on the Irifli fide, it ren-* 
ders the pallage, even in the darkeft night, convciUcnc and 
comfortable, hke a ftreet well lighted on both fides, I he 
fea rifes confiderably along ihis coaft. At low water you can 
walk round the point of the pier, which at high water is 
from ten to fifteen feet deep at the entrance, i his being 
the narrowed part of the Channel, has naturally the efFeft 
of accumulating the fluid Upon the fliores, when there is 
a fwell from a florm. What is farther deferving of re- 
mark is, that at Donaghadee, which is alinoll direflly op- 
pofite, the fea ebbs and flows near an hour fooner than at 
Portpatrick. There are alfo (which is ftill more remark- 
able) fome particular parts of the coaft, well known to 
our feamen, more efpecially one about two miles from the 
fliore of Portpatrick, where the fame faft is obferved. Within 
three or four miles of the Iri.l. fhore, when the flood re- 
turns, there is a regular current which fets off ftrongly for 
the Mull of Galloway. It runs at the rate of feven knots 
an hour, and is fo forcible, that when the wind oppofes it, it 
exhibits, for a great way, the appearance of breakers. It is 
called the Race of Strangers, and is a very curious fpeflacle. 

The Pachet Boats to Ire/and. — ^Thc mode of conveying the 
mail between the two kingdoms has undergone many changes. 
At firft regular packet boats, with falaries, were eftabliflied. 
But before the quay was built, and, while the paflage 
was attended with the difiiculties above defcribed, delays 
were frequent. The fallors, efpecially as their wages at 
all events were running on, often chofe to reft themfelve?. 
Eftablifiied packets were therefore abolifhed, and a rule fixed. 

That 

nel ; but the manner in which their fees are exacted, particu- 
larly when they meet with any difficuhy ia the payment, is ra- 
ther harfti and difagreeable. 



Of PortpatrlcL 4* 

That whpever failed firft fliould have the mail, and a certain 
fum for carrying it. This operated as a premium, and pro- 
duced, for a long time, a very good elFecl. Soon after, how- 
ever, as trade increafed, the allowance made by government 
became of lefs confequence. The packets were no longer 
the fame objeft. It often happened, that a boat would not 
fail with the mall, unlefs ,flie had fomething tlfe to carry. 
The mail coach alfo was eftabliflied, and the conveyance of tra- 
vellers became an object of attention. The boats which car- 
ried cattle were peculiarly offenfive to paffengers, not to men- 
tion that fujch a cargo, with a gjk of wind, was ev-en dan- 
gerous. Paflengers were tlierefore difgulted or deterred, and 
were often induced to take another rout. It was one great 
branch of Mr Palmer's public fpirited plans for promoting 
the commercial intercourfe of the Britilh empire in general, 
to unite as much as poffible the three great offices of Lon- 
don, Edinburgh, and Dublin. His mail coaches regularly 
went from Dublin to Donaghadee, on the one fide ; and 
from London and Edinburgh to Portpatrick, on the o- 
ther. Nothing, therefore, remained to complete the chain, 
but to obviate the inconvenicncies of the fci-ry at Portpatrick j 
this he did by reftoring eftabliflied packets. We have now 
four elegant veflels, fitted up with every accommodation, 
whofe only objeft is to forward the mail, and to convey 
travellers from the one ifland to tjie other. 

The town, which is in a great nteafure fi'pported by the 
concourfe, of travellers, has in a peculiar manner felt the be- 
nefit of thefe improvements. Almofl: every houfe is an inn, 
where ftrangers may find accommodation fuited to their cir-^- 
ctimftances. The jnoney they leave is the great fund out of 
which the inhabitants pay their rents, and lupport their fa- 
jnilies. The rapid change, however, which ha: fa!crr) place, 

YoL.L F is

Stati/lkal Account 



is greatly to be attributed to the late Sir James Hunter Blair, 
who happened to live at the critical period when the change 
began. He had fagacity enough to forefee the many advan- 
tages which muft refult from it, and forwarded the projec- 
ted improvement as much as poflible, by filling the harbour 
immediately with vefTels, and building almoft entirely a new 
towm, to accommodate the inhabitants and the travellers who 
pafled through it. Such is the origin and the progrels of im- 
provement which is generally owing, whether in a great ca- 
pital like Edinburgh, or a provincial town like Portpatrick, 
to the fpirit and exertions of particular men, who feem born 
for the purpofe of roufing the multitude from a ftate of ig- 
norance or torpor, from \vhicb they are too often unwilling 
to be emancipated. 

Mauufaclures. — Manufactures have not yet made their 
way to Portpatrick. Ship-building is the only one as yet at- 
tempted. Under the aufpices of the active and public fpirited 
citizen above mentioned, fome companies of (hipwrights have 
been formed, who are likely to carry on that branch fuc- 
cefsfully. The depth of the water, and the fhortnefs of the 
run, render it one of the mofl: convenient launches that can 
be conceived. 

Commerce. — Both our experts and imports have greatly in- 
creafed. We export here goods froni Paifley, Manchefler, 
&amp;c. ; and we import confiderable quantities of the Irifli linen 
manufacture. The inhabitants of Portpatrick, however, are 
generally only the carriers ; the dealers are thofe who, not 
being fuinciently opulent to freight and load large ftiips, car- 
ry on a hauking bufinef's by land. They bring their goods 
in carts, and hire the Portpatrick vefTcIs to convey them from 
one fliore to the other. 



Of Portpatrick. 4j 

Irijh Cattle. — Eut of all the articles of the commerce of 
Portpatrick, the import of black cattle and horfes from Ire- 
land is by far the moft interefting. Formerly fuch a com- 
merce was prohibited, for the purpofe of encouraging our 
own breed. The free importation was firfl: permitted by 5th 
George III. cap. 10. § i. for feven years, and from thence to 
the end of the then next feffion of Parliament. It was af- 
terwards continued by feveral temporary adts, and at laft 
made perpetual, by 16th George III. cap. 8. From the firft 
removal of the prohibition, there was a fmall annual impor- 
tation; but it was never carried on to any great extent till 

1784, when it rofe fuddenly without any cauie that has yet 
been affigned for it. In that year there were imported, be- 
tween the 5th of January 1784, and the 5th of January 

1785, no lefs than 18,301 black cattle, and 1233 horfes. 
The importation of cattle and horles, for the laft five yearsj 
ending the loth of October 1790, has varied in the follow- 
ing manner :

which, at an average, is about 1 1 000 head of cattle, and 
2000 horfes per annum. Great as this importation has been, 
it has not as yet materially hurt the fale, or diminilhed the 
price of cattle, in the neighbourhood of Portpatrick. On 
the contrary, the demand for them has been rather on the in- 
crcafe. It is probable, however, that it would have been 
greater, had there been no import.

BeuJes the cattle imported here, there are alio confiJer- 
able numbers fent from Belfaft, Bangor, Newry, &amp;c. diretSlly 
to England. The Engliih coal veffels always take back cattle 
troin Ireland when they have it in their power } but it is believ- 
ed that the largeft hnport is at Portpatrick. The great ex- 
tent of fea by any other paflage, efpecially in the winter fea- 
fon, is ra'iich againft the fafe and fuccefsful tranlportation 
ot a cargo, lo pcrKhable in itfclf, and liable to fo many acci- 
dents. 

This trade depends fo much upon the quantity of grafs, of 
hay, and of turnips in England, and fomctimes even upon the 
profipeft of large crops of thefe articles, that there is much 
fpeculation in it. Great gains and great loffes are, therefore, 
liiddfn and frequent. Iknce the import is unequal. Some 
people fuppofe that the trade is favourable to fmuggling, 
ami hoftik ro the revenue. Others objeft to it, as in a pe- 
culiar manner detrimental to thofe diftricfts in Scotland where 
bl^ck cattle are bred ; and there feems to be rather a hard- 
fliip ia permitfing foch numbers of cattle to be imported in- 
to- North Britain, or even carried through it, i-n order to rival 
the produflions 6f that very country, in the only market to 
which it has accds. Without entering, however, into thefc 
fpecufetions, it may be lufficient at prefent to remark, that 
the import will probably diminifh of itfelf, in confequence 
of the r'apid progrefs which Ireland is now making. The 
time is fa( approachifg, when that kijigdom v^ill be in ths 
fume Itatc in which England is at prefent, having a market 
within itfelf itifficieilt for the confumption of its own pro- 
duftions. Perhaps that may foon be the cafe in regard to 
other commodities, befides cattle. The Irifli arc rapidly im-

will remain few articles to barter between the two kingdoms. 

Fi/Jjeries .-—k very excenfive fifliery might be eftabliflied at 
Portpatrick, particularly of cod ; as the Channel is there the 
narroweft, and the tide the ftrongeft, none but the healthieft 
and beft fifh can live in it. The late bir James Hunter Blair 
propofed the cftablilhment of a filhing company, and, had he 
lived, he would probably have cftedted it. After his death, 
fome fiihermen came and planted their lines, but the rapidi- 
ty of the tide repeatedly carried them away. Unfortunately 
they had not flcill enough to increafe their anchorage, nor 
fagacity to difcovcr, that two ftone weight was heavier tham 
one. 

Population. — The return to the inquiries made by Dr. 
Webfter, regarding the population of the parilh of Portpa- 
trick, about forty years ago, was 55 1 fouls. It has fince ccn- 
fiderably increafed. It appears from an enumeration recent- 
ly made, that there are in the country part of the parifh, 
484, and in the town, 512, fouls, fo that the whole popula- 
tion amounts to 996, being an addition, in that fpace of time, 
of 445 fouls.

Rent of the Pari/h. — About the year 1761, the whole pa- 
rifh was valued, for the purpofe of afcertaining the amount 
of the teind, or the value of the tythes, and if was then efti- 
mated at L. 472 Sterling, But as the increafe has fince been 
very confiderable, the land rent alone is now about L. 1000 
per annum ; the town rent is at leaft L. 200 more j the dues 
of anchorage, and a duty of 2 d. per head on all cattle and 
horfes exported or imported, payable to the Blair family, 
may alfo bring in about L. 1 20, fo that the rent of the pari&amp; 
is rather better than L. 1300 a year. 

Stipend. — The ftipend has lately received an augmentation, 
and now yields about L. 80 a year, with the addition of a 
manfe, and a glebe of about twelve or thirteen acres. The 
church was built anno 1629, and has lately been repaired. 
Sir John Hunter Blair is patron. At prefent there are but 
three heritors in the parifti. ihere are feldom above twelve 
perfons on the poor's lift. The funds for the maintenance 
of the poor arile chiefly from weekly coUeftions at the 
church door, and cannot be calculated at more than L. !• 
per annum. 

Language. — The names of places in this parifh are faid to 
be of Gaelic original, but no perfon living remembers the 
time when that language was fpoken here. It is, however, 
more than probable, as Portpatrick was included in the an- 

tient 



Of Portpatrick, 



47 



tient kingdom of Galloway, it was of confequence inhabited 
by a tribe of the Celts. 

Antiqttktes and Natural Curlojit'tes. — The Caftle of Dunfkey 
is the only remarkable building in the parifh. It Itands up- 
on the brink of a tremendous precipice on the edge of the 
Irilh fea, and has been fecured on the land fide by a ditch and 
draw-bridge, the remains of which are ftill vifible. It was 
certainly built as a place of fecurity againft fudden incurfions 
in the days of violence, and in former times muft have been 
eafily defended. A cave in the neighbourhood of Dunlkey 
•ught alfo to be mentioned, on account of the great vene- 
ration in which it is held by the people. At the change 
of the moon (which is ftill conlidered with fuperftitious re- 
verence), it is ufual to bring, even from a great diftance, in- 
firm perfons, and particularly ricketty children, whom they 
often fuppofc bewitched, to bathe in a ftream which pours 
from the hill, and then dry them in the cave. 

The Cairtfpaty which rifes 800 feet above the level of the 
fea, and is fuppofed to be the fecond or third mountain in 
Galloway, merits alfo to be noticed. It bears all the marks 
of having been a military ftatlon, being furrounded by three 
ftone walls or intrenchments, with very ample fpaces between 
them, and commands a profpeft of Loch Ryan and of Luce 
Bay, which form the peninfula in which Portpatrick is fitu- 
ated ; England alfo, the Ifle of Man, Ireland, and part of 
the Highlands of Scotland, are feen rlGnj at a diftance.

Origin of the Name. 

TH E parifli of Hounam does not furnifli much room for 
ftatiftical inveftigation, and the few obfervations which 
occur refpc£ling it, may be comprehended within narrow 
bounds. The origin of its name cannot now be afcertained. 
There are many places in the neighbourhood, on the borders 
both of England and Scotland, ending in am. It is believed 
that ham, in the Saxon language, fignifies a habitation or vil- 
lage. Perhaps it was originally pronounced Hounaham, or 
the habitation of Houna, a name not unknown at the oppo- 
flic extremity of the kingdom *. 

H 

Situation and Extent of the Parifb. — The pariQi is fituat . -i 
in the county of Roxburgh, in the prefbytery of Jedburi j, 
and in the fynod of Merfe and Tiviotdale. It is of a circu- 
lar form, furrounded by the parifhcs of Morbattle, Jedburgh, 
and Oxnam in Scotland, and bordering on the oppofit^ 
fide with the county of Northumberland, where the top 
of the Fells, a range of the Cheviot hills, is the march. 
The parlfli, from eaft to weft, is about nine or ten miles 
Jong \ and in general is about fix miles broad. It may

be called a hilly or mountainous cliftri£t ; but the hills are 
green, and rarely incumbered with rocks or covered with: 
heath. The land is wet and fpungy, the foil light, and 
better calculated for grafs than grain. The air is healthy, 
and the people long lived. Three perfons who had refided 
in the parifh from their youth, died lately, at the advanced age 

of ICO. 

Sheep. — The principal circumftance for which this diftri^l 
is remarkable, is the Kale-water breed of Iheep, fo called from 
a fmall ftream running through the middle of the parifli. The 
fheep are of a moderate fize, and produce excellent wool. Their 
number ufually amounts to 12,000. Attempts have been made 
to improve the breed, by crolling with a larger kind, but the 
experiments did not fucceed. Though the Iheep became lar- 
ger, and the quantity of the wool was increafed, its quality 
was inferior. The moft approved ftock-farmers, however, 
have not the leaft doubt that the wool might be brought to 
Hill greater perfeftion by proper management, and by croffing 
with Iheep nearly of the fame fize, but whofe wool is the 
fineft poflible. The flieep not only produce excellent wool, 
but, as the farmers term it, they feed welly come to a tolerable 
good fize when fat, and are exquifite mutton. 

ProduElions. — The quantity of grain produced is very in- 
confiderable. Several of the farms in the higher part of the 
parifi) have fcarcely been ploughed in the memory of man. 
The foil being light and fandy, excellent turnips might b? 
raifed. Some have been produced in the parifli weighing 
above 26 lbs. avoirdnpoife. But the farmers have not as yef 
fucceeded in raifing this ufeful root, though they are extreme- 
ly fenfible of the great advantage that might be derived from 
Vol. I. G It,

it, particularly In the fpring. The farmers are in general too*" 
late in fowing them. Turnips cannct be railed to a great 
fize in this part of the country, unlefs they are fown about the 
end of May or the beginning of June ; but the farmers in the 
parlfh of Hounam are confiderably later. 

Rent of the Parip, — The land-rent i,s L. 2720. It has riferv 
more than a third within thefe lafl: fifteen years. The valued 
rent is L. 914 : 4 : 9. There are 8 heritors in the parifh, 2 
of whom are refident. There are only 14 farms, which, at 
an average, are from L. 250 to L. 300 per annum. The 
number of Iheep on a farm is from 50 to lod fcorc. 

State of the Churchy Is'c. — The waifs of the church were 
rep-aired about 40 years ago; but the building is ftill very bad, 
and worfe than any place of worfhip in the neighbourhood. 
The Duke of Roxburgh is the patron. The prefent incum- 
bent is Mr James Rutherford, who was admitted in March 
1775. He is married ; has a fon and five daughters. The 
manfe was built in 1776; but is placed too near the river, an(! 
confequently in a damp fituation. The ftipend, from the Re- 
Volution, amounted to L. 75 in money, and 21 bolls of vie- i| 
tual. In tonfequence of a late procefs of augmentation, the^ 
victual ftipend is now fixed at 63 bolls. There is no pa- 
rochial fund for the poor, excepting the weekly coile^tionsj 
and quarto-ly alTeiTments laid on the land-holders and their* 
tenant?, which yield, at an average, about L. '^o ptr annum: 

Population — The population of the parifh has of late con- 
fiderably diminiflied. The return to Dr Webfter, about 40 
years ago, was 632. Th-s number of inhabitants is at prefei:: 
365. Of thefe,

The number of burials do not exceed 4 each year. The 
■births are from lo to 12, exclufive of the feftaries, who are 
indeed but few, and have a rcgifter of baptifms of their 
own. There is not even a village in the pariHi; a few houfcs 
near the church not defcrving that name. The number of 
births, about a century ago, viz. from the year 1689 '^'^'^ 
year 1707, feem, at an average, to have bten 30 in the year. 
From the Union of the two kingdoms, to about the time of 
-the lafl; rebellion, the average number of births feem to be 
10 a year. From that time, the births have gradually de- 
creafed to the prefent number of 10 or 12. The wages of 
men fervants are between L, 7 and L. 8 ; of women about 
L. 4i Fifteen or twenty years ago, the wages of men fer- 
vants were about L. 5, and of women fcarcely L. 3, The 
wages of the fhcpherds, who conftitute one half of the parifli, 
confift of a certain number of cows and ftiecp to grafe on thf^ 
farm to which they belong, fhe people enjoy a confulerabie 
degree of the comforts of life. They are chearful and con- 
tented \ and there are but few poor. 

The great decreale of inhabitants, within the laft 40 years, 
IS evidently occalioned by the too general practice of letting 
the lands in great farms j but may be, in fome meafure, ow- 
ing to the mode of agriculture almoft univerfally adopted hi

a price), of converting the arable into pafture land. The 
lands, 50 or 100 years ago, were parcelled out into at leaft 
four times the prefent number of farms. As late as the year 
1750, five tenants, with large familie?, Occupied a farm now 
rented by one tenant. There were alfo, about thefe times, 
feveral fmall, but proud, lairds in the parifli. Their lands 
are now loft in the large farms, their names extinguiflied, and 
their manfions totally deftroyed. 

Afdiqu'itks. — A Roman road, or Jireet as it is commonly 
called, which can be traced to the fouth as far as Borough- 
bridge in Yorkfhire, runs through part of this parifh; it after- 
wards pafles by St Bofwell's Green, where the fair is held, and 
then bends its courfe towards the Lothians, The only other 
antiquity worth mentioning, is an encampment at the top of 
Hounam Law, which is the highen: hill on the border except 
the Cheviot. It was of confiderable extent, and within thefe 
few years a large iron gate taken down from the top of the 
Law, was to be feen at Cefsford Caftle belonging to the Duke 
of Roxburgh. There are fmaller encampments on the tops 
of the other hills in the neighbourhood, either made by the 
Romans when they invaded this country, or formed in the 
courfe of the many war? in which the Borderers of England 
and Scotland were antiently involved. 

Fuel. — The principal difadvantage under which this parifh 
labours, is the fcarcity of fuel. The common people burn turf 
or peat. The refident heritors and the better fort of farmers 
bring coal from Northumberland, partly in carts, from a place 
called Etal, about 20 miles diftant, and partly on horfe-back, 
from Birdhopecraig. The latt-er fpecies is abundant, and by 
far the moft valuable ; and it is a fortunate circumftance for 
the kingdom at large, that the beft fpecies of fuel (houjd be 

found 



ef Uounam, 

found even In the interior parts of Northumberland, In fuch 
confiderable quantities : It could eafily be conveyed to the 
fea by a canal and that beft nurfery of BritiOa feamen, which 
depends on the fupplying the great market of London with 
coals, may be thus preferved, even though they fail in the 
neighbourhood of the coaft.

Name^ Extenty and Boundaries. 

THK derivation is obvioufly from St Michael to whom 
the Church was dedicated. It is iituated in the pref- 
|5ytery of Lochmaben, in the county and Synod of Dumfries. 
It conlifts of the two pariflies of Knkmichael and Garrel, 
which were united about the year 1663, or 1664. The form 
of the united parifhes is nearly elliptical; being about ten. 
miles long and four broad in the middle. It is bounded on 
the fouth-eaft by the parifli of Lochmaben, on the fouth by 
Tinwald and Kirkmahoe, on the weft by Clofeburn, on the 
north-weft by Kirkpatrick Juxta, and on the north-eaft by 
the parifn of johnfton. 

Surface. — The upper or north-weft part of the parifh is hill)', 
and chiefly covered with heath, except only a few fpots of ara- 
ble ground on the fides of the river Ae, and the rivulet called 
Glerkill-burn. The lower or fouth-eaft part is in general 
plain, but interfperfed with feveral rifing grounds covered

irith heath, aod fomc Isrgc peat moflbs which fupply the in- 
habitants with fuel. There are now no open undlvidexl 
commons ; but there is, in the lower part of the parilh, a 
confiderable extent of ground (till lying unimproved. \n the 
tftatc of Kirkmichael and the barony of Rofs, and in tWQ 
other fmall properties, befides plantations, there may be 150, 
or nearly 200 acres of natural wood. There is much marihy 
ground, which, if properly drained and cultivated, might tura 
lo good account. 

Soil and Produce.— The foil on the fides of the river Ae in 
the wert, fouth, and fouth-eaft part of the parifh is very fer- 
tile, producing wheat, oats, and barley in great plenty ; 
the middle parts are moftly dry and gravelly ; but produce 
oats, barley, and pcafe tolerably well j the eail: fide, efpecial- 
ly by the fide of the river Kinncll, is very fertile- In ordina- 
ry years, between 6 and 10 thoufand fi:ones of oat meal are 
fold out of the parilh after the inhabitants have been fuppli- 
ed. in the remarkable years 1782 and 1783, the crops 
were not only fufficient for the demands of the inhabitants, 
but allowed a confiderable quantity to be fold in the ad- 
jacent parifiics. For the laft thirty four years, no crop was fo 
bad as not to furnilh the inhabitants with proTifion, and 
leave a great quantity for the market. The reafon of this 
fleady fertility feems to be the etfedts of the depth and moif- 
ture of the foil, which circumftances, though they may re- 
tard the harvefl: eight or ten days laier than in the pariihes 
immediately fouth of it, render the ground lefs liable to be 
hurt in dry feafons. Flax, liemp, and grafs, are rarely fowa 
in the parifii. The fowing feafon here ufually begins about 
the 10th of March ; and in good years, the harvefl; is coa- 
duded about the 1 It wee-k of October ; but tiiis year having

been uncommonly wet, the harveft was concluded only oil 
the 1 2th of November. 

yfzV, C/imate, and Difeafes. — From the quality of the foilj 
the range of high mountains on the north-well, and rivers 
and burns which run on each fide and acrofs the parifti, the 
air is necelTarily moift ; but, from the rapidity of the rivers^ 
the air is frequently changed, and feldom fuffered to ftag- 
nate. The inhabitants are remarkably healthy. There have; 
been no epidemical difeafes for thefe laft 34 years, except 
the fmall pox and meafles, which have never been uncom- 
monly mortal. Rheumatifms are the moft prevalent dif« 
orders. 

Populaiioti. — The number of inhabitants is 950, viz. 505 
males, and 445 females. The proportion between batchelors 
and married men, including widowers, is as one to four 
nearly. There were no records prior to the year 1727, and 
the records which were kept from that time to 1759, are fo 
inaccurate, that it is impoffible to judge of population for- 
merly. About 30 years ago, the number of inhabitants was 
about 730 ; and cpnfequently the increale fince that period 
is 220 fouls. The increafe feems owing to the divifion and 
cultivation of a very large common, and the improvement of 
other lands. The increafe would probably have been much 
greater, had it not been for the practice of leading farms as it 
is called j that is, a farmer on one farm poffefles at the fame 
time another fmaller farm, which is faid to be led along with 
the other. About fixty years ago, the number of farms was 
above 20 more than at prefent ; and, within thefe few years, 
feven confiderable farms, that formerly had numerous fami- 
lies refiding on chem, are now led along v.ith others, and 
-arc confec^ueatly uninhabited.

The annual average number of births is a6; of burials 18 
or 19; and of marriages nearly 6} and each marriage pro- 
daces, at an average, 5 children. There are at prefent 60 
perfons between 50 and 70 years old ; and 25 between 70 
and 100. One man ia the parifli is 103 years old. His ac- 
count of himfelf is, that he was born in the borro^uing days * 
of the year that King William came in, and that he was bap- 
tifed in hidl'ings^ (i e. fecretly), by a Prefbyterian minirter 
the following fummer, as the Curates were then in the kirks. 
Though he is now moftiy confined to bed, he retains his 
mental faculties very diftincl; and three years ngo he wrought 
at the harveft in perfeiH: health and fpirits. A weaver who 
died a few years ago, remembered his being feveral times 
employed to ride King WiiUam's dragoon horfes to water, 
when they were going to Ireland before the battle at the 
Boyne. 

Occupation and Dlvifion of the Inhabitants. — There arc 60 
farmers; the average of perfons in each family is fluc- 
tuating and uncertain, being ufually more in fummer than 
in winter-, there are 4 blackfmiths; 4 carpenters; 3 mil- 
lers; 4 flioemakers; 6 taylors ; 16 weavers ; 3 clogmakers ; 
3 little merchants; i furgeon, an old man. No nobility or 
gentry refide in the parifli. There are three fmall villages 
in the parifli ; the largeft confifting of 1 00 fouls, and each of 
the other two of about 70 or 75. They live on three large 
corn farms, on which, with their own induftry, they fubfifl: 
pretty comfortably. The people, in general, are oeconomical 
and induftrious. Very few of them have gone into either 
the army or navy thefe many years. They enjoy, in a rea- 
fonable degree, the comforts and advantages of fociety, and

fcem fo live contented. They are in general charitably dif^. 
pofed. The number of Seceders, Cameronians, and Relief 
people, young and old, are about 50. All the rert are of the 
Eftabliflied Church. There are no Catholics nor Epifco- 
palians. 

Rent of Lands. — ^The land rent of the parifla amounts to 
tibout L. 2300 i and, if to this be added the intereft, at 10 
per cent, on L. 2000 of grafliims, the whole will amount to 
about L. 2500. The valued rent is 4315 merks Scots. 

Church. — The living, or fiiipend, is L. 5 5 : 1 1 : ly, with 
L. 3 : 17 : 9y, for defraying the expences of the facrament. 
The glebe confifts of about 1 4 acres of high lying land, which, 
with the manfe and garden, could not be rated at above 
L. 10 a year. The Duke of Queenfberry is the patron of the 
old parifh of Kirkmichael, by a charter from the crown 5 but, 
as the patronage of the old parifh of Garrell is not in that 
charter, and as Garrell was a menfal church of the Arch- 
blfnopric of (^lafgow, the crown claims the right of being 
vice-patron of the united pariHi. Dr Burgefs, the prefent 
incumbent, was prefented to the charge in 1759; he is now 
a widower, with an onty daughter. The twp pariflies were 
united in 1660, but not without fome difficulty on the part 
of the parifiiioners of Garrell. 

The church of Garrell was built in 1617; but Kirkmi- 
chael becoming the place of worfliip after the union of the 
two pariOies, it was fufrered to fall to ruin. The diurch of 
Jvirkmichael was partly rebuilt, and fomewhat enlarged, in 
3 729, and covered with flates In place of heath, with which 
3t had been formerly thatched. It was repaired again, and 
confiderably enlarged, by a late decreet of th? Court of Sef- 



of Kirkmkbael. 5gj 

fion, and the church-yard lurrounded with a good ftone and 
lime wall, and coped with free itone. 1 he manic was part- 
ly new built, and partly enlarged, in 172^, and has had two 
or three repairs lince that time; but it i^ fiill rather a cold 
uncomfortable dwelling. The number of heritors is 13 ; of 
whom only 2, of fmall property, relide in the parifii. 

State of the Poor. — The poor receiving alms are only 5 ; 
who are lupported, partly, by weekly collections, which, 
with fmall fines exaiSted from delinquent:-., and dues paid for 
tiiarriages and baptifms out of the church, amount, annually, 
to L. 14 or Li 15, and partly by aims, in meal and other 
viftuals, given thern from houle to houie, or lent to ihecn 
when unable to go about the parilh. There are no legacies 
or mortifications, nor as yet is there any need of them. 

In extraordinary cafes of diflrefs, we have a cuftom which 
deferves to be taken notice of in a paper of this kmd ; and 
that is, when any of the lower people happen to be re- 
duced by ficknefs, lolles, or misfortunes of any kind, a 
friend is lent to as many of their neighbours as they think 
needful, to invite them to what th y call a drinhitig. This 
drinking confifts in a little fmall beer, v.'ith a bit of bread and 
cheefe, and fometimes a fmall glai's of brandy or wniflcy, pre- 
viouily provided by the needy pcrfons, or their friends. The 
guefts convene at the time appointed, and, after colle£ling a 
IhiUing a-piece, and fometimes more, ihey divert themfeves 
for about a couple of hours, with mufic and dancing, and 
then go home. Such as cannot attend themielves, ufually fend 
their charitable contribution by any neighbour that choofes 
to go. Thefe meetings fometimes produce 5, 6, or 7 pounds, 
to the needy perfon or family.

Wocds.—'As to timber, befides a pretty large wood of for- 
reft trees, with extenfive plantations of common firs, pitch 
firs, filver firs, laburnums, beeches, oaks, planes, limes, &amp;c. 
On the eftjfte of Kirkmichael, there are feveral of the rarer 
fpecies of indigenous trees, the Prunus padus, (birds cherry). 
Viburnum opulus, (water elder), honeyl'uckles, buUaces, and 
nicuntain allies. 

In the barony of Rofs there was, till within thefe lafl feven 
years, an extenfive wood, called Knock wood, confifting al- 
jnoit wholly of excellent oaks, which was lold by the prefent 
proprietor for about 800 guineas; and, inifortufiately, has not 
fince been properly fenced from the Iheep and cattle in the 
riti^b.bourhood. 

As to rare plants, of the lefs uleful kinds, there are, in 
the piiriPn, tiie Pyrola rotundifolia, (the \yinter green), An- 
dromeda polifolia, (the marOi ciflus, or wild rofemary), the' 
Lichen ventofus, (or ftorm liverwort), Lichen venofus, (or 
veined liverwort^" Lichen burgenfii, (or crowned liverwort), 
with fcvcral others. 

The number of black caflle, on an average, are eftimated 
at between 1000 and 1200; fheco from 8000 to 10,006 j 
ar.d horfes at above 100. The wiUl quadrupeds are foxes, 
otters, badgers, hares, wild cats, polecats, ermines, and wea- 
Tds. As the eltate of Kirka-icliael abounds both with natu- 
ral wood and planting-, t!iere is, of couric, a confiderable va- 
riety of birds. Befides black cocks, moor-fowl, partridges, 
plovers, wild ducks, teals, and fnipes, there is great plen- 
ty of the rarer fpecies of bird;;, the land and the warer 
rails, the quail, the milTel thrufli, the pine and the common 
bulfinch, the wryneck, the golden- crefted and the willow- 
wrens.

the grey, the barn, and the horned owls. 

Of migratory birds, there are the cuckow, the goatfucker,

river fwallow, the curlew, called here the ivhaupy the lap- 
wing, plover, or tewit, the king's fi;:.er, the fea lark, the

about the iftof Auguft; the curlew and lapwing about the 
middle of March, and depart about the middle of Auguft ; 
the houfe and window fwallows about the 20th of April, and 
depart from the 4th to the 30th of September; the fwift and. 
goatfucker arrive about the commencement of continued day- 
light, (/ e. here, about the 1 oth of May), and depart about the

comes up the rivers about Chriftmas, and ufually ftays about 
three or four weeks ; the fandpiper, fea Inrk, and mew, vifit 
and ftay through the whole of the breeding feafon ; indeed, 
the gull, mew, and flitldrake, are often here in the winter, 
when the weather is mild. 

With regard to mineral fprings; — there ore feveral veins 
of iron ilone and ocher in every quarter of the parifli, and 
confequently many fprings of chalybeate water; but none 
of a flrength fo remarkable as to be any way noticed or fre- 
quented. There are two lochs, or lakes, in the parifh, viz. 
one towards the head, of about two or three acres in extent, 
apparently very deep, but without iifii of any fort ; and an- 
other

other near the foot, containing ten or twelve acres, In which 
there are a great number of pike and eel, but not fo nume- 
rous as to fervc the neighbouring inhabitants as an article 
of food. 

Price of Provifions. — About 40 or 45 years ago, a beef cow, 
which at prefent cofts from L. 5. to L. 6. and fonietimes 
more, could have been purchaled for L. 2 : 2 : o, or L. 2 : i o : o, 
at the utmoft. A fat ewe or wedder, that fells now at 12 s. 
or 14 s. could have been bought then for 5 s. or 6 s. ; and 
veal and lamb in proportion. Pork was little ufed here till 
within thefe laft 20 or 30 years; ii*is now very generally eaten, 
and fells at 3 4. 31 d. and 4 d. the pound, according to its 
goodnefs, and the quanthy that happens to be in the market. 
Geefe were then to be had at 8 d. or p d. a- piece ; ducks at 
3 d. or 4 d. ; hens at 4 d. j chickens at 1 J d. and 2 d. ; but- 
ter at 4 d. the pound, equal to 24 ounces averdupois weight ; 
cheefe at 2 d. per pound ; oats from i s. to i s. 3 d. the Dum- 
fries peck, which is equal to the Winchefter bufhel ; bear and 
barley from is, 2d. to is. 6d. "Wheat v/as feldom fown 
here at that period. At prefent, all thefe prices are greatly 
increafed, and fome of them confiderably more than dou* 
bled. 

Price of Labour. — The general wages for day labourers in 
hufbandry, and other work, is 8 d. v.fith vi£luals, or i s. with- 
out them ; carpenters, bricklayers, and mafons, have ufually 
I s. 6d. or I s. 8 d. ; and taylors 8 d. and their viftuals. In 
general, the wages now paid to workmen of every defcription 
are double what they were 20 or 30 years ago. The wa- 
ges of male fervants, about 30 years ago, were from L. 3 to 
L. 4 a year ; at prefent they are between L. 7 and L. 8, and 
fome ftill higher : Maid fervants, at the above period, had

from L. I : 15 : o to L. 2 : 5 : o a year ; they now get from 
L. 2 : lO : o to L. 4 : 10 : o. 

Antiquities. — There are feveral indiftin£l remains of an- 
tient fortifications, but no traditions about any other than 
a fraall fort in the Knock Wood, called Wallace's Houfe, 
faid to have been thrown up by Sir William Wallace, after 
he had flain Sir Hugh of Moreland and five of his men, at 
a place ftill named, from that event, the fax corfes, i. e. the 
fix corpfes ; and where there are two or three large ftones, 
v;hich feem to have been fet up in remembrance of feme fuck 
tranfadion. 

There are fome fmall tumuli, or cairns ; but none of them 
have been opened, nor have their contents been examined. 

There are feveral barrows, or burrans, as they are called 
here. They feem to have been intended for folding cattle 
at night : And it is obfervable, that, when one of thefe bar- 
rows is on one farm, there is always one oppofite to, and 
within call of it, upon another. This has probably been done 
with an intention, that, in cafe of any inroad from the Eng- 
iifh Border, whoever of the herds or keepers firft obferved, 
the enemy, might give notice to, and be ready to afiift, the 
other, either to defend, or carry off the cattle to places of 
greater fafety. 

The only Roman works jn the parlfli are, a branch of 
the great road that led from Netherby in Cumberland to the 
chain of forts built by Lollius Urbicus, between the Forth 
and the Clyde, that can ftill be traced through a mofs, and 
feems to have terminated at a caftellum, which is now the 
minii^er's garden, and of which two fides remain ftill very 
diftinft. 

About 



ff4 Staii/lical Account 

About fix years ago, there was found, in a fniall piece of 
peat mofs, near the line of the road above mentioned, a pretty 
large pot, of a fort of bafe copper, and a decanter of the 
fame metal, of the fhape and fize of our white ftone quart 
decanters, with three feet, about i \ inch long. They were 
both fent by Dr Burgcfs to the Society of Antiquaries at 
Edinburgh, and are in their mufeum. They were thought 
to be Roman. They might have been thrown into the place 
where they were found when the Romans left the caftellum, 
perhaps purfued by the natives, and obliged to abandon fome 
of their heavy baggage, to expedite their flight.

Situation and Surfacd 

THIS parifti is fituated in the county of Tiviotdale, pfeCi 
bytcry of Kelfo, and Tynod of Merfe and Tiviotdale. 
It is about fix Englifti miles long, and four broad ; being 
bounded by the parifli of Carham, in England, and by Yct- 
holm, Linton, Kelfo, Ednam, and Eccles, in Scotland. That 
part of it which lies by the fide of the Tweed is flat, and 
liable to be overflowed ; and the corn is frequently fwept off 
the ground. The fouthern part of the parifta is higher ground;^ 
though not hilly. The foil, by the fide of the Tweed, is ex- 
cellent, and very fertile : No part of the parifli, however, is 
barren. 

Cultivation, Product, and Rent. — Cofn of all kinds, clover^ 
rye-grafs, flax, turnip, cabbage, and moft forts of garden ve* 
getables, are raifed in this parifli. Oxen and deep are fed 
on turnip with confiderable profit. The magnitude of farmsy 
which of late have been increafing, is reputed a grievance. A 
farm was lately let at L. i : 7 : o per acre. The valued rent of thft 
parifli is L. 13,263 : 6 : 8 Scots ; the real rent is about L.435a 
Sterling. There are four pofleflLrs of landed property ; but

none of them rcfide liere. Agriculture is greatly improved. 
Wore com is raifed, and more cattle and (heep are fed for the 
market, than formerly. 

Church and Siipt/id.-^The church and manfc were built 
about ten years ago. The ftipend, inchiding the glebe, may 
be valued at L. i 20. The Duke of Roxburgh is patron. 

Population. — The population, as is thought, has not varied . 
for thefe forty years part. There are many perfons between 70 
and lOo years of age. The number of fouls in the parilh is 
fuppofed to be about 1000. It is probable that the popula- 
tion has diminifhed confiderably fince the year 17 14; and the 
union of farms is perhaps the caufe of this diminution. The 
annual average of births, from 1714 to 1750, is 37; from 
1750 to 1790, is 30. The rnoft numerous clafs of artificers 
are weavers ; there are 30 in the village of Sproufton ; 8 ma- 
fons, and 4 carpenters. There are about 60 feceders in the 
pan{h 

Poor. — The annual average of the poor, from 1737 to 
1758, is 33; and from 1758 to 1790, is 18. The average 
of the monthly diftributions to them, during the firll of thefe 
periods, (from 1737 to 1758) is L. 3 : 1 8 : 10 ; and the ave- 
rage during the lad is L. 3 : 19 : 1. The oldefl: records that 
could be found of the poors rates, begin in the year 1737. 
The mode of providing for the poor in the (hire of Tiviot- 
dale, and the only legal mode, though not univerfally obier- 
ved, in Scotland, is this : The heritors, with the minifter ^nd 
elders, have the power of making up a liil of the poor, and 
affefling for their monthly maintenance. The afleflment con- 
tinues fix months ; the heritors paying the one half, and the 
tenants the other, according to their relpedtive valued rents7 

Perfons 



Of Sprouflon. 



Perfons who become objefts of charity, from ficknefs, or other 
caufes, are relieved by the feflion out of the weekly collec- 
tions. The poor live in their own houfes. The cflefts of all 
the poor enrolled are inventoried, and fold at their deceafa, 
which is a check againft impofitions. 

Price of Provifians and Labour — The price of all kinds of 
provifions, elpecially of oatmeal, has greatly in creafed ; and, 
if potatoes had not been introduced, the price of oatxneal 
muft have been ftill higher. There is a confiderable advance 
in the wages of all lervants. Men, during harveft, receive 
L. 1:4:0, and women L. j, with diet ; a man' hired for a 
day I s. ; and a woman 10 d. Forty years ago, a man's wa- 
ges, in harveft, was only 8 d. and a woman's 6 d. a-day. A 
cottage muft give the farmer one reaper. A labourer gets 
1 s a-day in fummer, and 10 d. in winter. His wages are 
fufficient to enable him to bring up a family. Taylors wages 
are lately advanced from 4 d. to 6 d. and 8 d. a-day. 

Fijh, — The Tweed, which runs along the north fide of 
this parifli, abounds with falmon. They lell high in the 
fpring, the greateft part of them being fent, by Berwick, to 
London ; but the prices vary confiderably ^ and, in fummer, 
they are tolerably cheap. There is a projedl for carrying a 
canal, along the Tweed, from Berwick to Kelfo, or even 
higher. 

Mifccllaneous Qbfervations. — Sea fowls appear here in great 
numbers in the fpring, about feed- time 5 they follow the 
plough, and are thence called fted-birds. Coal, the only fuel 
ufed here, is brought from England. The roads are bad, 
owing, probably, to the ftatute labour being commuted. It 
is the general opinion that turnpikes have improved the coun»

Name, Siiuation, and Surface. 

IT is uncertain whence the name of this parifh is derived. 
It is in the fhire of Berwick, prefbytery of Dunfe, and 
lynod of Kelfo. It is twelve miles long and fix broad ; fur- 
rounded by the pariflics of Dunfe, Langton, Greenlaw, Weft- 
ruther, Cranfhaws, and Abbey St Bethun's. It is quite hilly j 
being in the midd of that ridge of hills which divides the flat 
and rich lands of Eafl Lothian from the beautiful, well in- 
clofed, and highly cultivated plains of Berwickfhire. The 
greateil part of the furface is covered with heath, eaten by 
fmall black faced fheep, which, when removed to good paf- 
turcs, may be fo fattened as to weigh lo or 12 pounds the 
quarter. 

Cultivation and Produce ^The lands near the rivers Whit- 
adder and Dye, have been improved by lime brought from 
Eafl Lothian at the diflance of 17 miles, and have been made 
to raifc oats, barley, peafe, rye-grafs, red and white clover, 
and turnip. But the farmers are prevented from great exer- 
tions by the high rents, the great expcnce of manure, the 
^jadnefs of the roads, and the diftancc of markets. Tl^e in-

land rent amounts to L. 1 700 a-year. There are 9 heritors. 
The patron of the parifti, Mr Home, is the only refiding 
one. 

Climate and Population — ^The air is dry, cold, and piercing. 
The only difeafes are rheumatifms and cutaneous diforders, 
which feem to be occafioned by poor food, damp houfes and 
want of cleanlinefs. Population, owing to large farms, to the 
tenants refiding at a diftance, and to part of the lands being 
turned entirely into pafture for flieep, is on the decreafe. 
The number of fouls is 452 ; of families, 100; of perfons from 
16 to 60 years of age, 112. The number of births, in thefe 
laft fix years, is 47 ; of marriages, 21 ; of deaths, 27. Many 
people born in this parifli being obliged to feek employment in 
other pariflies, all who die in the parifla noi bein^ buried in 
it, and thofe only regiftered that are buried here, the deaths 
bear but a fmall proportion to the births. 

Poor, and Wages. — There are j families, confifling of 13-

Name, Situation^ and Surface. 

THE name of Lauder feems to be of Celtic original, de- 
rived from the word lade^ which fignifies the paffage, 
or courfe, and fometimes the mouth, of a river ; and it is li- 
terally applicable to the fituation. It is fituated in the high- 
eft part of the Mcrfe, or Berwickfhire. It extends about eight 
miles from north to louth ; but the bulk of the parilh is con- 
tained in four miles, upon the ftrath of Lauder water. It is 
bounded by the pariflies of Channelkirk, Stow, Melrofe, 
Earlfton, Legerwood, and Weftruther. The (oil is rather 
light and fandy. It is in general fertile ; and, of late, has been 
highly cultivated. The ground riles gradually from the river, 
on each fide, to hills of a moderate height, and moftly green. 
They are covered with a mixture of heath and juniper, which 
makes excellent fheep pafture. 

Culii-vat'ion, Produce, Farms^ ^c. — ^There may be about nine 
fquare miles in corn and hay grafs. Sown grafs, for pafture 
and for hay, is much cultivated. The hay fells from 4 d. to 
7 d. per ftone, according to the demand. Good crops of 
wheat have been produced ; but this grain is thought to be

too exbaufting for the foil. Excellent oats and barley are 
raifed, and exported weekly to Dalkieth and Edinburgh, 
efpccially oats and oatmeal. The foil produces flax in great 
perfection ; hut, at prefent, it is only cultivated for the ufe 
of the inhabitants. Turnip and potatoes are reared to a great 
extent ; and flieep and oxen fed here with much advantage. 
The average rent of farms is from L. 50 to L. 150 per ainiuin. 
In the neighbourhood of Lauder, the land lets from 20 to 40 
shillings per acre ; but the average rent of arable land is from 
5 to 10 fliillings per acre. Since the late improvements in 
hufbandry commenced, fome farms have been divided into 
two or three, and fome fmaller ones have been united, ac- 
cording to the fkill or ability of the tenant. There is little 
land inclofed, except in the neighbourhood of Lord Lauder- 
dale's houfe. Ail are convinced of the advantages of this 
pradtice; and it will probably advance with conliderabls ra- 
pidity. There was formerly abundance of natural wood, 
efpecially on the low grounds, and by iht fide of the river. 
It was long ago wed out j but the proprietors are beginning to 
plant again. 

Minerals, b"V. — There are fome copper mines, but, it is 
fuppofed, not fufficiently rich to defray the expe^ice of work- 
ing. Moor-ftone is every where to be met with. It is ufed 
for inclodng, and is very proper for the purpole, being large 
and flat. The flate founa here is of an inferior quality. Ad- 
der-ftones, arrow points of flint, commonly called c/for fairy 
Jlofies, are to be feen here; and, in tlie neighbourhood, Hones 
of fanciful fhapes, as of fnails, worms, and other animals. They 
are found after heavy rains, by which they are wafhed out of 
their beds.

rlfh, is fuppofed to amount to 10,000. The breed Is, of latf, 
confiderably improved. Taking the produce of this, and of" 
the neighbouring parifhes, into confideration,the town of Lau- 
der feems to be one of the beft fituated places in Scotland for 
the cftablifhment of a woolen manufafture. Turnips are 
ir.uch cultivated for feeding (heep ; but, fince the late game 
Aft, the hares have become fo numerous as greatly to injure 
the crops of that valuable article. 

Population. — There are at prefent about aooc fouls in the 
pari(h. Its population has been increafing, particularly fince 
an eafy communication was opened between different parts of 
the country by means of turnpike roads. 1500 of the inha- 
bitants are above 10 years of age. About 1000 of thefe re- 
fide in the country part of the parifh, and the remainder in 
the borough of Lauder. 7'he annual average of marriages is 
about 8 or 10; that of births and deaths about 30. Each 
marriage, at an average- produces 5 children. The people, 
in general, live long . Many have furvived 90, and fome even 
100, during the incnmbeucy of the prefent minifter. Some 
are below mi Jdlc ftature, many above it ; and the fize of not 
a few is upwards of fix feet. The people are, generally, ftrong 
and healtiiy. There are about 40 farmers in the parifh, and. 
a conGderable number of artifts in the borough and country. 
There is in this parifh t feceding minifter; though the num- 
ber of feceders is but fmall. There are two writers, and two 
furgcons. As this parifli, when Dr Webfter made his in- 
quiry, contained only 1714 fouls, it has increafed, within 40- 
years, about 300 in population. 

Church-, and Stipend — The church of Lauder was original- 
ly a chaj)el or cafe to Channel-kirk., or Childrens Kirk, being 
dedicated to the holy Innocents. At the Reformation, Lau-

lcr was made a parochial charge. At firft, the church flood 
on the north fide of the town, fronting Lauder fort ; and it 
was in this old church that the Scotch nobiUty were affem- 
bled, when they determined to make a prifoner rf Jnuies ill. ; 
and the houfe in which he was leized is itill ftaading T^he 
ftipend, including the glebe, is between L. 90 and L. 100 per 
annum i half money, half victual. 

Poor The number of poor in this pariih is about 30. 

Their maintenance amounts to about L, 8c /i j/; ■ .iri- 
ling from affeirments, Sunday's colleftions, and dues for lend- 
ing the pall, called in Scotland the mort-cloth. 

Wages. — The wages of a country fervant is from 5 to 7 
pounds per annum ; of labourers from 9 d. to i s. a day ; of 
carpenters, mafons, and gardeners, about i s. 3 d. The price 
of every kind of labour is greatly increafed; reapers wages are 
almoft doubled The wages of women fervants have advan- 
ced from 20 to 40 {hillings per annum; and of fuch as work 
at turnips, and milk ewes, to L. 3 per half year. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervaiions , — The air is pure and healthy j 
and this place has been often called the Scotch Montpelier. 
The land rent of the parifli may be about L. 6coo Sterling. 
There arc fix heritors of rank, only one of whom refides in 
the parifh. The number of feuers, or fmaller poffelTors of 
land, is confiderable. There are about 100 ploughs, and 
many of them of modern conftrudion. 

For 30 years paft, much improvement in education, man- 
ners, and the mode of living, as well as in feveral other parti- 
culars, has been introduced into this part of the country. la

been lately created for the purpofe of grinding barley and 
wheat. There are now turnpike, parochial roads, and 
bridges made, and kept in good repair, by the toll-bar mo- 
ney, and ftatute-labour commuted into money according-to 
the number of fervaiits and horfes. The turnpike roads have 
been the caufe of many other improvements. Coal, lime, 
and the eftablilhment of a woolen manufadture, arc want- 
ing. The people arc generally adive and fpirited, and have 
always been ready to engage in labour of any kind : Many of 
them are, at prcfent, both in the arujy and navy. The poor, 
in general, coniider themfelves able to bring up a family with 
an income of about L. 12 Sterling. 

In 1782, and 1783, the fituatlon of the Inhabitants was 
truly deplorable. It was the end of December before the 
harveft was finifhed, after a great part of the crop was dc- 
ftroyed by froft and fnow. None of the farmers could pay 
their rent ; foine of them lofl: from L. 200 lo L; 500 Ster- 
ling. The country, however, was greatly relieved by the im- 
portation of white peafe from America. Many found great 
advantage in feeding their cattle with furze or whins, beat 
into a m.afl). The poor were relieved" by the expenditure of 
the public funds, which fupplied them with grain at a mo- 
derate price. There were lilcewife feveral liberal contribu- 
tions for this purpofe. But the fituation of this part of the 
country, and, it is believed, of all the fouth of Scotland, was 
iViU worle in 1 766 : In confequence of a parching drought 
during the whole fummer, two thirds of the cattle were 
flnughtered at Martinmas, and fold at 3 farthings a pound. 
Many of thofe that remained died at the ftall in the fubfe- 
quent fpring, after having confumed all the fl:raw that could 
be provided for them. Bear ftraw fold at i s. 6 d. per threave.

Prior to that period, fiot above four or five fmall beeves were 
killed in Lauder market at Martinmas. Since that time, in 
confequence of the pultivation of turnip and grafs, there has 
been plenty of the bell: beef and mutton through the vfhole 
year. 

Peat and turf were formerly ufed here for fuel ; but, fince 
the turnpike roads were made, coal, though tranfported from, 
the diftance of 1 5 niiles, is' ufed for that purpofe both in town 
and country. The farmers find it moil for their advantage 
to bring home lime in the fummer feafon, and Coal when re-, 
turning from Edinburgh or Dalkieth markets. Thefe two, 
with Kelfo and Haddington, are the markets neartft this pa- 
rifli. 

Arit'iqtiliies. — A confiderable quantity of Spanifli, Scotch, 
r.nd Englilh coins, have been dug up. The antiquity of the 
firrt extends no farther than the age of Elifabeth. The Scotch 
and Englilh belong to the age of Edward Longfhanks, and 
Alexander I. of Scotland ; and fome of them are of a later 
date. The minifter of Lauder is in pofiefiion of fome of 
thefe coins, and alfo of feveral Roman coins, whofe infcrip- 
tions are, Lucius Flamiriiiis, Julius Cacfar^ fe'j. There are 
many Pictlfli and Scotch encampments in this parlih and the 
neighbourhood. All cf them are of a round or oval figure, 
and are called rings by the common people. The Roman 
encampments were fquare or rectangular ; but none of thein 
are to be feen in this part of the country. The largelt Scotch 
■or ricliih encauipment in the parilh is on Tollis-hi]l, or 
TuUius-hill. It is on the ro.id between Lauder and Had- 
dington, and is fuppofed to have got its name from a Romm 
army palling through this country, and commanded by a Tul- 
lius. Mary tumuii are to be feen in Lauder moor, on t!^t=:

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q793327">AYTON</name>. 

By the Rev. Mr George Home.</head> 

<p>

Name, Situation, ^c. 

THE parifh of Ayton feems to take its name from the 
water of Eye. It lies in the county of Berwick, pref*- 
bytery of Chirnfide, and fynod of Werfe and Tiviotdale. 
The parijfhes by which it is bounded are Eyemouth and Col- 
dingham on the north, Chirnfide on the weft, Foulden and 
Mordington on the Ibuth, and by the lea on the eaft. Ihe 
parifli is about 4| miles long, and 4 broad : It was once of 
larger extent, when Lammerton, Rofs, and Shiels belonged 
to it. The foil is in general fertile, and particularly adapted 
for the turnip hufbandry. There is about 2 miles extent of 
fea coaft. The fhore is high and rocky. The hills in this 
panfti he chiefly in the fouthern extremity. The Ibil of fome 
of them, efpecially of a ridge of no very confiderable height, 
is in general well adapted for producing corn or grafs. 

Cultivation and Produce. — Agriculture has undergone a great 
change in the courfe of a very few years. Inftead of five or 
fix fucceffive white crops, the farmers will feldom allow two 
to follow each other ; for they derive confiderable advantage 
from introducing a green one, and occafionally fallow, be- 
tween 



1^ Stat'ift'ical Account 

tween the white crops. The experience of this neighbour- 
hood has rather a tendency to prove, that money expended 
in the cultivation of moor lands has feldom turned to a good 
account, and that planting is the beft mode of improvement ; 
the efFe^ls of water, however, has not been tried. Lime o- 
perates at firfl-, but lofes its efFeft: as a ftimuhis upon a fecond 
trial. Though the appearance of moor lands may be chang- 
ed by culture and artificial grafles, they will not feed well ; 
and, when wet or cold, are believed to lay the foundation of 
the ret in (heep, a diflemper which proves extremely fatal. 

Two horfes only, are at prefent iifed in the plough here, 
jnftead of four oxen and two horfes, which was formerly the 
practice. They will perform the fame quantity of labour 
equally well, and in much fliorter time. The Englifli plough 
is chiefly ufed in this parifli. The lands produce niofi: of the 
common vegetables, plants, and trees. Artificial grafl'es are 
much ufed. Of late the farmers here directed their atten- 
tion, and with great fuccefs, to ftock. They find that the 
.lands in grafs make a profitable return. By feeding, too, the 
ground is enriched for future crops. The advantage of feed- 
ing Iheep on the lands, in the proper feafon, with turnip, is 
fenfibly fJt ; and this practice is fuppofed to be preferable to 
a tlimmer fallowing ; and is, at the fame time, no lofs to the 
farmer. 

Plantations of all kinds of trees are much encouraged by 
the prefent proprietor of the eftate of Ayton, which contri- 
butes greatly to enrich and beautify the country. His lands 
fome years ago were all run-rig*^ as was very much the cafe,

particularly upon the boarders, with a view to engage the 
people to a mutual defence and prot«(5^ion of their property, 
in times of tijrbulence and hoflility. They are now divided^ 
Jiave convenient farm-houfes, and are highly innproved. 
Harvefts are rather early here than late. The greateft part 
-of the lands in this parifli is inclofed with hedges. Fences 
of this kind are recommended both by their beauty and uti- 
lity. The rife of rent feems to have operated here as a fpur 
to exertion and improvement in agriculture. The farms 
have rather decreafed in number. Some of them, though 
but few, extend to 500 or 600 acres. 

Air and Dijlempars — The air is dry and falubrious. The 
fogs arifing from the fea fcldom penetrate above a mile from 
the fhorc. The ague was very common prior to the improve- 
ments and inclofing of lands ; but fince that time this difor- 
der has fcarcely been known here, except during the laft ve- 
ry open winter. 

Horfesy Sheep, is'c. — The horfes bred atid ufed here arc 
flender ; but they are very aflive, and able to undergo 
much fatigue: They have advanced much in value. The 
breed of fheep is both good and large ; their weight, at 
an average, is about i8 or 20 lbs. per quarter. Four of 
their fleeces yield a ftone of wool. Five flieep may be 
maintained upon an acre of fome of the beft lands. The 
number of fheep in this parifii, till whhin thefe ten or twelve 
years pafl, was fmall. Great advantage arifes from the large 
breed lately introduced : Eefides yielding more wool, they 
are fit for the market in two years time ; while flieep of 
the fmaller fize require to be kept three years before they 
are ready for the market. The wool of the large fheep i', 
without doubt, of a coarfer quality ; but this difadvantage is

more than compenfated by the quantity. On rich lands 
even the fmall kind of fheep %yould increafe in fize, and their 
wool become more plentiful, though of an iRfeiior quality* 
The wool fells from 12 s. to 15 s. per ftonc. Oxen here are 
commonly fed till they weigh from Co to 100 ftone. 

Fijld. — The water of Eye contains good trouts, but not la 
any quantity. Cod, ling, haddocks, whitings, flounders, hol- 
lyback, mackrell, and other kinds of fifh, are caught here in 
their feafons. Lobfters yield confiderable profit ; they are 
chiefly bought up for the London market. Herrings hare 
been got in great quantities ; but they, as well as the other 
kinds of white lifli, have failed much for thefe tvvo years paft. 
The fifhermen have lately difcovered the method of catching 
turbot, which brings a goot^ price. 

Pcpubtion. — In 1 74 r the village of Ayton feems to have 
contained about 320 fouls, and the country part of the parifh 
about the fame number. In 1773 the village contained abouc 
360 fouls : The numbers in the country part Were alfo in- 
crealed. In 1780 the number of the inhabitants amounted to 
1 146, of which 420 were in the village, and 726 in the country 
part of the pariih. In the prefent year, 1790, the number a-« 
mounted to 1245. The. village contains 147 families; there are 
2Q2 males and 229 females above ten years of age, and 5 1 males 
and 47 females below 10 years of age. The country part of 
the parifn contains 136 families, which coniill: of 2(33 males 
pnd 3 10 females above 10, and 53 males and 90 females be- 
low 10. From this ftatement it may be remarked, that dur- 
ing the lafl: ten years the population of the village has re- 
ceived an addition of 109, while the country part of the pa- 
rifti has fufFered the decreafe of 10 in its numbers. On the

iiifhdie, the increafe of inhabitants within the hfb 50 years, 
may be ftated at above 600. 

Village of Ayton. — The village of Ayton is fituated on the 
banks of the Eye. About 30 newr houies have been fcued 
in it within thefe I5 years ; they confill of two or three fto- 
ries, and are covered with tyles. The village has been im- 
proved by ranging thefe new buildings upon a pleafant flop- 
hig bank fronting the fouih. 

Mamfacluns — A paper-mill was lately erefted here at 
Confijderable expence. It employs about 70 Or So work peo- 
ple, and circulates about L. 25 per week. The wages earned 
by the paper-makers are high. I'his manufacture gives em- 
ployment to a number of young perfons, who are taken in at 
eight years of age. There is a wind-mill here, which was a 
pretty extenfivc work. It manufadured a good deal of flour 
during the American war, but has done little or no bufinefij 
fince. There are four Water-mills in this parifl^i one brew- 
ery, which does not carry on an exteniive trade ; a bleach- 
field, which was eftablilhed many years ago, and lucceeds : 
It employs about 7 or iS hands, 

Church and Stipend. — The p.irifh church appears to be an 
old edifice, and has lately received fcveral improvements, 
which its former ftate rendered extremely neccilary. The 
Hipend, including a late augmentation, a.id the value of the 
glebe, is about L. 135 per amium. The Crown is patron. 

Poor. — The number of the poor belonging to this parilh is 
variable. The heritors ;irid tenants are affefled to the extent 
of L. 30 or L. 40 per avmtm for their fupport. To this fund 
is addvd one half of the ccntributions at the churchy which, 

at

at an average, is about is. ad. weekly. The other half iSr 
diftributed under the infpei^ion of the kirk-feffion in occa- 
iional charities. Part of it, together with the money arifing 
from marriages and the ufe of the pall (mori-cloth) is applied 
to educate poor children and pay church cfficera. The ex- 
pence incurred for the maintenance of the parochial poor has 
jncrealed near two thirds during the incumbency of the pre- 
sent minifter. The people in general, however, cannot bear 
the idea of being put on the poor's roll, even vphen they arc 
in diftrefs. During a late period of fcarcity meal was pur- 
chafed for the ufe of poor houfeholders, and fold at a very mo- 
derate price ; bat few applied for the benefit of this aid, ex- 
cept thofe who were accuftamed to receive charity. 

Price of Provlficns. — The price of butcher meat is from 
old. to 4d. ^ifr lb. Englifh weight} it has advanced about 
I d, per lb. within thefe 6 or 8 years. The price of pork is 
variable. Haddocks, which fold formerly at 4d, or 6d. per 
jcore, now often bring as much a piece. A goofe is fold here 
for 2 s. •, a pair of ducks for i s. 3 d. ; a pair of hens for is, 
dd. ; a turkey for 2 s. 6 d. ; butter fells for yd. and cheefe 
for 4 d per lb. The prices of grain may be afcertaincd frook 
the fiars of the county. 

Wages, — The wages of a labourer are i s. a day ; a car- 
penter's and mafon's, is. 4 d. ; a t;iy!or's, 1 s. Thiefliing of 
corn is ufually paid by v/hat is termed let, i. e. 1 boll is allowed 
for every 25 bolls that are threllied. The wages of a niafon 
and his labourer, &amp;c. are generally fettled at fo much a rood. 
A hind receives 2 bolls of barley, i boll of peafe, and lo bolls 
of oats ; he has a cow's grafs, a houfe and yard, and as much 
ground as will ferve to plant a firlot of potatoe*. lie is like-

mily, paying only the prime coft, which is about 2 s. 8d. 
per cart load, including the tolls ; the carriage is equal to 4 3, 
per load. The hind's wife reaps in harveft for the houfe* 
He has alfo L. i allowed for fheep's grafs. A man fervani 
receives from L. 5 to L. 7 per annum^ with bed and board ; a 
maid fervant from L. 2 to L. 4 per annum, 

SeBaries. — There are feveral re«naries in this parifh. The 
firft was a fociety of Antiburghers. Their number is very 
fmall. Their minifter is provided with a very good houfe^ 
and receives from them, perhaps, about L. 40 per awium. 
There is alfo a Burgher meeting- houfe in the village, rather 
of a better appearance than the other ; the fedt of Seceders 
who attend it are more numerous than the former, and of 
principles more accommodating to the times. They alfo 
provide a houfe for their minirter, and allow him, probably, 
L. 60 or L. "JO per annum. Both thefe houfes have been built 
fince the 1773. Though a confiderable number have attach- 
ed themfelves to the different fe^taries, yet, being compoftd 
of the inferior ranks of the people, their defedion has not 
diminifhed the contribution for the parochial poor. Little is 
allotted by them to the maintenance of their own poor ; yet 
they contribute with zeal, many of them with liberality jll 
fuiteJ to their circumftances, for the fupport of their eccle- 
fiaftical eftablifhment. 

Roads. — The roads in the parifh are getting into good re- 
pair. The pofl road is now made, and fupported by two 
turnpikes, which were lately eredled ; one at the extremity 
of the county towards Eafl Lothian, and the other at Berwick 
bounds. When they were firft propofed, they met with keen 
oppoGtion ; b'ut they have fince been univerfally acknow- 
ledged to be of fignal benefit to the country. The ftatute 

iabour 



Statffiical Aciount 



labour is commuted. Putting up tlie roads to au£tion, ha* 
been the mean of getting them made much cheaper than 
formerly^ 

Improvements fuggejled. — It would be an advantage to this 
parifti, as well as to Eyemouth, if the mail-coach would drop 
a bag, containing fuch letters as are addrelTed to the inhabi- 
tants of each, which would relieve them from the expence 
offending to Berwick or Prefs. If the woollen or cotton ma- 
nufacture were introduced and encouraged here, the condi- 
tion of the people might be greatly improved. To take the 
duty off coals carried coaft-ways to Eyemouth^ as is done at 
Dunbar (to which port Eyemouth belongs) vvould great- 
ly promote the eftablifhment of manufadures. This du- 
ty yields but a mere trifle to government, and fubjefts the 
people here to a ftate of entire dependence on Northum- 
berland for fuel. As the coal hills adjoining to this part of 
the country are almoft entirely engroffed by one perfon, it 
would be rather furprifmg if he did not avail himfeif of this 
advantage, by keeping up the price of fo important an article. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervailojis. — The kelp made here is fuppofed 
to be about 15 or 20 tons annually. There are fome quar- 
ries in this parifli, the flones of which anfwer for buildings 
and are fuppofed to be impregnated with an iron ore. Free- 
ftone is confined to a fmall part of the fhore. The free-ftone 
muft be tranfported to the harbour of Eyemouth, and then 
carried by land. Corn is carried to market in carts, which 
have been ufed here for the fpace of 40 or 50 years. On the 
hills on the fouth fide of the parifli are the remains of two 
campsj fuppofed to be Roman or Saxon. Several urns, and 
broken pieces of armour, have been found here. In the lovr 
grounds towards the north-v/eft, are the veftiges of three en- 
campments.

campments, thought to have been Danifli or Pictlfh, Hifto- 
ry mentions the caiVIe of Ayton, but fcarcely any velliges of it 
now remain, ilie names of places feem to be derived chief* 
ly from the Saxon. There is one public, and two privatdt 
fchools in the parifh. The eftabliflied fchoolmafter, as is toQ 
generally the cafe, has not a provifion adequate to the im- 
portance of fuch a charge. There are two white thread- 
makers in the parifh. There are two or three bridges -, 6rit 
of them ^'as built by aid from government : They are of 
great utility. Two boats crews only belong to Ayton. 

In 1673, ^l^cfc appears to have been 24 heritors, indading 
portioners and feuers, in this parifh : In 1790, there are about 
14. At the former period, they were more diftinguiflied 
by family and rank. There were 6 of the name of Home, 
each of forae diftin£lion ; now there is only one of that name ; 
their lands having been difpofed of by the great heritors. 
•There are, however, feveral defcendants of portioners who 
ftill retain their poffeffions. 

The people, in general, are difpofed to induftry. Since 
the induclion of the prefent minifter there is a very vifible 
change iti their mode of living and drefs. Though the farms 
^•e much higher rented than formerly, yet the tenants are, 
in every refpetEl, much more expenfive than they were 15 
years ago. Tradefmen and labourers in the village are ad- 
dicted to the pernicious habit of ufing tea. Of late, alfo, 
from the low price of whifky, the execrable cuftom of dram- 
dtinhing is gaining ground, even ^mong the women of the 
lower clafs. Habits fo inimical to health, induftry, and mo- 
rals, ought to be checked if poffible. Tvsro perfons belong- 
ing to this parifli have been banifhed from Scotland fince the 
incumbent was fettled. He knows only of one perfon who

has been guilty of fuiclde. There is no want of employment 
for the people. They feem contented with their fituatiou 
and circumftances, and are not ftrangers to the comforts of 
life. 

This parifh has feveral advantages. It is near markets, 
for difpofing of grain, cattle, or ftock on the farms, being 
7 miles from Berwick and 2 from Eyemouth. It is at no 
great diftance from coal : The price, however, confidering 
that diftance, is certainly high. The poft road to London 
goes through the parifh : And the vicinity oi the fea affords 
a good fupply of moft kinds of fifh. The parifh of Ayton 
does much more than fupply itfelf with provifions.

<p>
Naine^ Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface. 

THE name of the town, parifh, and county of Air, be- 
longed firft to the river, and was derived to thein 
from it. It is probably of Celtic origin ; for, according to 
the information of a gentleman {killed in the Jrifli language, 
j^hre fignifies thin or fhallovv, and is truly defcriptive of the 
water of Air compared with the neighbouring water of Dohn, 
now Doon, which, flowing out of a large lake, is furnifhed 
with a more deep and copious ftreain. There are two towns 
of the fame name in France, ylire in \rtois, and j4ire in Gaf- 
cdny, which, no doubt, have the fame etymology. The an- 
tient nan.e of this parifh, as appears from fome old papers, 
Was Jre ; the modern name is Air or Ayr. It is fituated ia 
the county of Air, prcfbytery of Air, and lynod of Glaf- 
gow and air„ Its form is quadrangular. The weft fide, a- 
bout a nnle and a half long, is bounded by the Tea ; the north, 
about 3 miles long, by the river Air ; the fouth, about tlic 
fame length, by fhe river Doon ; the eaftern fide is fully 4 
miles long, bounded by the parilLes of Dalrymple and Coyl- 
ton. For a mile and a half fouth of the town, the country 
is quite flat, and the (oil fandy. It is nearly the faii^e on the 
M north

north fide of the river, and the rife is but fmall for two miles 
more. On the eaft the rife is gradual and beautiful for two 
miles and a half. The fpil is for the moft part deep, much 
improved of late, and beautified by elegant plantations. The 
fhorc is flat, and, in general, (andy. There are fome funk 
rocks ; but they are not dangeroois. 

Climate a?td Difeafes. — The air, upon the whole, is rather 
moifl, owing to the clouds, which are waffed hy the fouth- 
wefl wind from the Atlantic Ocean. With a wefl wind, 
which is often the cafe, little or no rain falls upon the parifli 
of Air ; the clouds being broken or. the highefl: point of the 
Ifle of Arran. About the time of the Equinox, there are 
frequently high winds. In fpring, there are often long tradH 
of cold winds, which blow from the north-eaft and the north. 
Though the climate is falubrioiis in general, yet perfons of a 
confumptive habit ought to dwell at a diftance from the pa- 
rifh of Air. A Tea voyage gives the beft chance of recovery. 
The common diflempers incident to children prove lefs fatal 
here than in neighbouring towns. No fields can be more 
commodious for walking, or the healthful exercifes of riding 
and golfing. Wife parents fend out their children early to 
fport upon turf full of different forts of clover, particularly 
the yellow and the white. Once or twice within thefe 43 
years, a dangerous fore throat, accompanied with a putrid 
fever, has been epidemical. 

Lahes and Mineral Springs — There are two fmall lakes, one 
toward the fouth-fide, named Carleny, and the other at the 
eaftern extremity, called Loch-Fergus^ which is mentioned in 
the town's charter about 600 years ago. It appears that fome 
confiderable edifice has flood in its vicinity, out of the ruins 
of which feveral houfes have been built. It has a fmall iflc

in the middle, and, probably, was a herenrj. In this lake 
are pike and eels, but few trouts. There is a mineral fpring 
on the north fide of the river, found out near 50 years ago, 
and ftill ufed by a few poor people. It comes from a mixture 
of coal and u-on, and has been thought efficacious in feveral 
jdiforders. 

Haddock and cod have been very plentiful on Air 

poaft fince the herrings left it : Mackarel has been fcarce for 
fome years paft : Soals and turbot are rare. White fifli are 
generally fold at i d. per Englifh pound. The price of fal- 
mon in January, and till the month of March, is between 6d. 
and 3 d. per pound. They are much fcarcer than formerly, 
owing, it is fuppofed, to the liming of land. The price is 
kept high, too, on account of their being carried to Kilmar- 
nock, Irvine, Glafgow, and chiefly Paifley. Forty years ago, 
herrings were caught in great numbers, and fold from 6 d. 
to 3 d. per hundred. Sail-fifh of large fize are fometimes 
taken, whence are got oils for tanners. The feafon for white 
fiQi is through the whole year, except about fix weeks, from 
the end of March till the beginning of May, old ftile. When 
herrings were caught at the mouth of Air river, a lamp was 
uiually placed there. This lamp was of great ufe in prevent- 
ing Ihip- wrecks ; and the lofs of feveral lives, and loaded vef- 
fels, at the end of the year 1 789, may be imputed to the want 
of it. 

C.itltivation and Produce. — Very little ground in this parifli 
row lies wavte or common. Between 80 and 90 acres, free 
to every burgefs, for feeding milk cows, was lately inclofed. 
About 20 acres of common was fcued from the town, little 
jnore than 30 years ago, at L. 112 Sterling, with 18 s, 9 d. 
of feu-duty. Being brought into good tillage, and finely 

planted,

planted, k fold iii 1 790 for L, 1 1 00 Sterling. Thirty years 
ago there was much heath towards the eaft; it is now g- eeo^ 
or yielding crops. Sea-weed is thrown in plentifully by win- 
ter florms, and much ufed in manuring land. Marie, in the 
higher grounds, is got in abundance, and is of great advan- 
tage, as there is little lime but what is imported from Ireland. 
Oats are fown from the end of February to the end of March ; 
peafe and beans are Town in April ; barley in May and June. 
"Wheat fown before winter is commonly firfl: reaped, towards 
the end of Auguft. The parilh is fcarcely able to fupply it- 
felf with provifions, as appears from importations, and no 
great decreafe of price. Little flax is raifed, at leart for fale. 
A confiderable quantity of artificial grafles is raifed with 
great fuccefs. Moft of the wood in the parilh is youpg, but 
thriving well. 

Population. — It appears from the records of the Sailors So- 
ciety, that, when wine was imported at Air from France, ths 
population was much greater than at prefen'. When a plagu« 
broke out here, near 200 years ago, according to tradition, 
about 2000 died. In 1745, the inhabitants were reckoned 
about 2000. The return to Dr Wcbfter, m 1755, was 2964 
fouls. Trade fince that time revived, particularly tobacco 
which added confiderably to the population. Inclofirg 
took place much about the fame time; and in the years 1 747, 
1748, 1749, and 1750, the herring fifhing was great : Sailors, 
coopers, &amp;c. were of courfe numerous. Upon the whole, 
the inhabitants have been increafing fcnfibly, though not ra- 
pidly, for more than 30 years paft. The number of examin- 
able perfons in the parilh, reckoning from 7 years of age and 
upwards, is above 3400. Of thefe there are 3009 in the 
town, and the remainder in the country. The number of 
fouls may therefore be ftated a: about 4100 fauls. 

Many

age. One walked to London after his looth year; another 
^bove 100 died a few months ago.

, There are above 600 inhabited houfes in the pariHi. The 
number of heritors is about fio. There are 2 minifters of the 
Ertablifhed Church, 2 Moravians, i Epifcopiiian, and i Me- 
thodift. There are 2 phyficians, 3 furgeons and apothecaries, 
and about 16 writers. The feceders amount to about 50 or 
60. 

^laie of the Poor. — Weekly collections, and other parifh 
funds, put it in the power of the feffion to diftribute L. ico 
per anvum. The town gives L. 30, the failors L. 10, the 
writers L. 5, the merchants L. 3 ; and other fmall corpora- 
tions contribute to the extent of L. 14 or L. 15; befides 
which, there is a half year's jiint of L. 50. The feffion re- 
tains^ for occafional chanties among poor tradcfmen, and 
j?thers, about L. ab. If any part of this fum is faved at the

end of the year, it is added to the funds of the Charity-houfe. 
This houfe was built by fubfcription in 1756, and is fit to re- 
ceive 60 perfons; but, as many penfioners prefer a fmall week- 
ly allowance out of the houfe, there are feldom more than 
40 in it. Alderman Smith of Londonderry, bom at Air, left 
L. ICQ, feveral years ago, to purchafe bnd for poor houfe- 
keepers. This charity has proved very leafonable. Provoft 
Cochrane of Glafgow, born and educated at Air, left like- 
wife L. 100, the intereft of which is appointed to be given to 
a reputable burgefs's widow or daughter during life. An in- 
firmary and bridewell are much wanted. 

Price cf labour and Provijtons, — A labourer, with a wife 
and 5 children, is able to earn 7 s, per week, and fometimes 
a little more. At an average, he purchafcs 3 pecks of meal, 
and a greater quantity of potatoes, half a cart of coals, and 
foap to the value of 2d. per week ; 3 ftonc of wool, at 7 s. 6 d. 
the fione, for clothing, and 10 lib. of lint, at lod. per lib. 
per annum. His wife's attendance on the children prevents 
her from earning much. This may ferve as a general fpeci- 
men of the wages and expences of a labourer's family. A 
flioemaker, if induftrious, gets from i s. 2 d. to i s. 8d. a- 
day; a mafon from 1 s, 3 d. to i s. 8 d.; a wright from 1 s. 3 d. 
to I s. 9 d. ; a taylor is. 2d. The price of provilions is more 
than doubled within thcfe laft 50 years. Beef and mutton is 
now from 4 d. to 5 d. per lib. Lamb is from i s. 3 d. to 
2 s. 6 d. per quarter i pork 6 d. per lib. ; veal from 4 d. to 6 d. ; 
pigs from 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s. ; geefe 2 s. ; ducks from 9 d. to is. ; 
chickens 4 d. and fometimes lefs ; rabbits 9 d. ; butter from 
6 d. to 8 d. per lib. ; cheefe from 4 d. to 6 d. ; wheat from 
21 s. to 25 s. per boll ; barley from iS s. to 20 s. j oats from 
x6 s. to 18 s. 

Church 



9f Air, St 

. Church and Stipend.— The prefent church was built in 1 654, 
and is kept in good repair by the magiftrates. The old 
church, ftiled St John Baptid's, was converted by Oliver 
Cromwel into an armory ; for which he gave an allowance of 
1000 Englifli merks to build another. It was in St Joha 
Baptift's church that the parliament met to confirm Bruce's 
title to the throne. Records of their federunt fhew, that 
numbers of the nobility could only lign their initials. The 
fenior minlfter's living, including the glebe, is about L, 130 
per annttm. The King'ls patron. The town getierally al- 
lows the fenior minifter 12 guineas for a houfe. The l.gal 
ftipend of his colleague would fcarcely amount to L. 75 ; but, 
from regard to him who at prefent fills the charge, the ma- 
giftrates and council, befides allowance for a houfe, have add- 
ed a fum which makes his ftipend L. 105. T'he town-coun- 
cil and feflion are patrons. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. — ^There are no volcanic appear-^ 
ances in this parlfti, unlefs large rocks, and fragments of rocks, 
which have numerous indented ftones, or metals of dififerenf 
kinds, be confidcred as fuch. Various figured ftones and pe- 
trifadlions have been found in the parifh. There is a confi- 
derable quantity of moor-ftone lying on the furface of the 
ground. The free-ftone lies rather deep. Some houfes in 
the town let at L. 201, but a greater number between, that 
fum and L. 10. The rent of the falmon fifhery in the river 
Doon is L. 80 ; that in the river Air a Lttle lefs. The mar- 
kets here are good. The common fuel Is coal. The price 
paid at the pit, per cart, is from 2 s. 3 d. to 2 s. 6 d. The 
one pit is half a mile diftant, and £he other rather more. Th..t 
at Drungan, in the parlih of Stair, though a little dearer, is 
undoubtedly the bcft. According to tradition, there was a 
battle fought, before the Chriftlan aera, in the valley of Dal- 

rymple,

Siatyilcal Account 



rymple, in which two Kings, Fergus and Coilus, 'fell. It is 
added, that Lochfergus takes its name from the former, and 
the river Kyle from the latter. Thither Coilus, it is faid, was 
purfued and flain. The fmall village of Coylton, 6 miles eaft 
of Air, liicewife is faid to derive its name from him. It has 
been fuppofed that Dalrymple, Dale-rot-mel^ fignifies the val- 
ley of the flaughter of kings. Ihere is a cairn of ftones in 
the midft of this valley. In June 1734, a ball of fire palTed 
through two oppofite windows of the newefl: fteeple, broke 
one end "of the bell bomb-joift, and then defcended to the 
ftreet, but did no more harm. A boy in the neighbourhood 
was killed by another ball of fire. Perhaps the only inunda- 
tion that deferves notice happened in 1739, attended vrith a 
great ftorm. This raifed the river much, and forced Ihips of 
confiderable burden quite out of the channel. </p>

18 miles weft from Edinburgh, on the fouth fide of the Fritli 
of Forth, is in the prefbytery of Linlithgow, and fynod of 
Lothian and Tweeddale. It is about 1 mile in breadth from 
north to fouth, and about 2 miles in length from eaft to weft 3 
bounded by Abercorn on the eaft, Borrowftounncfs on the 
weft, and Linlithgow oh the fouth. The foil is raiher of a 
light kind, and agrees better with a rainy than a dry feafon : 
The climate, in general, however, is dry and healthy. The 
land is all arable, and produces grain, grafs, and vegetables of 
every kind. It is let out to fmall tenants genernlly, moft of 
whom are poor, and live poorly, at 30, 40, or 5c fliillings 
per acre. The greateft part of it is inclofed.

Staiijllcal Account 



CoaL — ^This parlfb is full of coal, for which there is great 
demand. It likewife abounds in free-ftone. The coal is of 
a fine quality, and is^ the only fuel ufed in tlie parifh. It is 
carried to London, to the northmoft parts of Scotland, to 
Holland, Germany, and the Baltic. It fells at a higher price 
on the hill, and to the country people who live near, and 
therefore muft ufe it, than any coal in Scotland, It lies very 
deep ; this may be one caufe of its high price. There are 
above l oo carts employed in the cial Works, to drive coals to 
the fea and the fait pans.

Population. — ^This parilh contains, at an average, between" 
1400 and 1500 fouls. Perhaps the eighth part of the people 
are feceders. Each marriage, at an average, produces 6 chil- 
dren. Many of the inhabitants have attained to 70, 80, and

In the parifti. The alteration3 here, and hi the neighbour- 
hood, with regard to the drefs and manner of living of the 
people, are very great. 

Villages. — There are 4 villages in the parifli ; Grangepans, 
Bridgenefs, Benhardpans, and Blackncfs, Moft of the (hip- 
ping that is now in Borrovvftounnefs formerly belonged to 
Grangepans : But, fiiice a good pier and harbour was ^redied 
in Borrowftounncfs, moft of the lliips lie there. The trade 
along the fouth fide of the Forth is much decayed. It is 
gone to Grangemouth, which is 4 miles up the Frith from 
Jorrowfiounnefs, and the entry into the great canal. At 
prefent Borrowftounnels has little trade but what arifes from 
the coal and fait worlcs. 

Wages. — Servants wages are very high here. A fervanf 
man, who would have been fatisfied, i^o years ago, with 
L. 1:5:0 half yearly, now gets L. 3 or L. 4 half year- 
ly, and fometimes more. A fervant maid, who got 10 or 
1 1 fliillings per half year, 40 or 50 years ago, now gets 30, 
40, and foraelimes 50 (hillings in the half year. A day-la- 
bourer gets I s. or I s. 2 d. a-day, who was formerly hired for 
5 d. in winter, and 7 d. in fummer, per day. The price of 
provifions has rifen in proportion. 

Ztiptnd, — The ftipend is precifely 8 chalders of victual, or 
L. 800 Scots. The glebe is 5 Scots acres, valued at 30 {hil- 
lings per acre. The Duke of Hamilton is patron. This living 
would have fupported a family 50 years ago better than 
L. 120 Sterling could do here now.

Name^ Siluation, Extent, Soi/^ and Surface* 

THERE ia- a tradition, though it is believed very ill 
founded, that Coylton derives its name from a King 
called Coilus, who was killed in battle in the neighbourhood, 
and buried at the church of Coylton. This parilh is in the 
diftridi of the county of Air called Kyle, in the prefbytery of 
Air, and fynod of Glafgow and Air. It is 7 niles long, and, 
at an average, about 2 broad. It is bounded on the fouth by 
Damellington, on the eaft by Stair, on the north by Tarbol- 
ton and St Quivox, on the weft by Air, and on the fouth- 
%veft by Dalrymple. The foil of the greater part of the parifh 
is clayey, which, when properly cultivated, is abundantly fer- 
tile. The holms near the rivers of Air and of Kyle, are fer- 
tile and dry. Tlie parifh, in general, is flat; one farm, how- 
ever, on the fouth is rather high ground. 

Populatlcn. — Forty years ago, the farms were in general 
finall and run-rig, which wa: neceflarily an obftacle to im- 
provement. The proprietors at that time occupied their own 
lands, and kept them in grafs, which, of courfe, diminifhed 
ihe number of inhabitants. The lands being afterwards 

properly 



Stafiftical Account 



properly divided, were let in larger farms, and population 
again increafed. The number of inhabitants, as returned to 
Dr Webfter, was 527 ; at prefent they amount to 667. For 
thefe laft eight years, the annual average of baptilms is about 
15 ; of marriages 9 j and of burials 16. 

Poor. — 10 or 12 poor perfons are generally fupported by the 
feflion The funds are about L. 50 Sterling at intereft, and 
the weekly collections made at the church. 

Retti. — The valued rent of the parilh is L. 3330 Scots; 
the real rent about L. 20.00 Sterling. The number of heri- 
tors is 9 ; 2 of whom refide in the parifh. 

Church and Stipend, — The church, which is aij old prebeu- 
dary, was repaired about 16 years ago. The manfc was built 
ijti 1750. The ftipend is 5 chalders of victual, half meal half 
barley, 500 merks of money, and 100 merks for communion 
elements. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiom. — ^The air is wholefonie. There 
are three confidcrable lakes, particularly one called Martor- 
ham, a mile long, and in fome pans ^ quarter of a mile 
broad. Lime, marie, and feveral ftrata of coal, are lately 
found. Coal is the only fuel ufed in rhe narifli. There are 
feveral plantations : Both they and the n^rtural woods are in. 
a thriving ftate. A labourer's wages are 1 s. per day. All the 
inhabitants of this parifii belong to the Eftablifhed Church.

Situation, Extent^ ^c. 

THE parifh of Ballantrae is fituated in the extremity o? 
the county of Ayr, towards the fouth *, and marches 
Vfhh the fhire of Wigton on the fouth and fouth-eaft. It is 
nearly ten miles fquare. It is bounded on the north and 
nortli-caft by the panfli of Colmonell ; on the fouth and 
fouth-eaft by the parilhes of New Luce and Inch, in the lliire 
of Wigton ; and by the fea on the well and Ibuth-Weft, hav- 
ing an extent of more than ten miles of fea coaft. The

rifh of Colmonell, were originally conneflef^ with tiie prefbyte- 
ry of Ayr, and fynod of Glafgow and Ayr ; but were disjoined 
a liu'e time after the Revolution, on a 'count of their great dif- 
tance from the feat of Prefbytery, and annexed to the prefbyte- 
ry of btranraer and fynod of Galloway The parilh cakes its 
name from the village of Ballantrae, which is evidently of Gae- 
lic original, and iignifies, in that language, the toWn upon or 
above the fhorc; alluding to its lituation on a gen:!e afcent im-

of Ballantrae, is in general high and rocky, having a trcriicn^ 
dous furf or fwell beating againft it, when the wind blows 
from the weft and north-weft. Oppofite to this coaft the 
fea appears land-locked, for a mbft fpacious bay of nearly 25 
or 30 leagues diameter is formed by part of the coaft of Gal- 
loway, the moft part of the two counties of Down and An- 
trim in Ireland, the eaft coaft of Argyleftiire, artd part of 
Dumbartonfhire, and by the whole ftretch of coaft along the 
Ihire of Ayr for about 80 miles ; all this vaft extent of coaft 
is eafily difcernible by the naked eye in a clear day, together 
with the iflands of Sana, Annan, Lamlafti, Bute, and the two 
fmall iflands of Cumbray. About four or five leagues north- 
weft from Ballantrae ftands the illand of Elfay : It is a moft 
beautiful rock of a conical figure, covered on the top with 
heath and a little grafs. It is not inhabited by any human 
creature ; but affords refuge to an immenfe number of fea 
fowls who breed on it, and is ftocked with rabbits and a few 
goats. It is the property of the Earl of Cafiillis ; and is 
rented at L. 25 Sterling a year, the tenants paying their rent 
from the feathers of the different fea fowls, from the folan 
geefe that breed on it, and the rabbit fkins. It affords a fine 
objeft all round that coaft, and a mark for fhips either com- 
ing into, or going out of the Frith of Clyde. There is an 
old ruinous caftle on it, about a third part up the rock, 
faid by Campbell, in his Political Survey of Britain, to have 
been built by Philip II. of Spain, but on what authority is 
not known. There are four light-houfes, one at the nevsr 
built harbour of Portpatrick, another at the town of Donag- 
hadeej a third on the Mull of Canty re, and a fourth on the 
ifland of Cambray ; and it might be of fingular ufc to the 
towns of Air, Irvine, and Saltcoats, which carry on a confi- 
derable trade with Ireland, and the towns on the weft of 
England, if a fifth light-houfe was crefted on a fmall low

jifland, called the Lady Ifle, in the bay of Air. The fliore 
• all along that part of the coaft is flat and fandy ; the bay is 
deep, and the entrance into the harbours ftrait and difficult. 

Surface, Soil, ^c. — The land in this parifii rifes with a 
gradual flop from the fliore to the tops of the mountains, 
which form part of that extenfive range of hills that Itrttches 
acrofs the fouth of Scotland, almoft from the Irilh fea to the 
Frith of Forth beyond Edinburgh. Near the fhore the foil 
in general is a light, dry, hazle mould, upon a gravel bottom, 
and for the moft part but thin. The furface is much diver- 
fified with heights and hollows, interfecled with a great num- 
ber of httle ftreams of water delcending from the hills All 
beyond the mountains is a foft mofly ground covcied with 
heath, and a thin long grafs called li.ig L-y the country peo- 
ple. Even below the mountains, heath is the prevailing ap- 
pearance, excepting where th. ground has been in tillage, or 
immediately upon the ihore, where there is fome very tine 
natural grafs. '1 he ground is in general acL^pteJ to the 
breeding and feeding of black cattle and flieep, and is uni- 
verfaliy applied to that, purpoie, excepting the grain which 
the inhabitants raife for their own ufe. 

Population and condition of the People. — There are 770 in 
the parifh, and of thefe about 300 are m the village. The 
annual number of births is 18. The number of deaths 
cannot be fo well afcertained, as it is but of late years that a 
regifter of thetn was kept at all, and even that not accurate- 
ly, and the marriages ftill lefs. The marriages, as would be 
€xpe£led, from the fituation and habits of life of the peo- 
ple in the country, are, in general, p|-clific. Inltanccs are 
to be met with of a woman bearihg fourteen chilJrea 
to one hufband. The average of births to each n,ar- 
riage may be taken at fix. The inhabitants are lodged 
Vol. I. O in 



Siatiflical Account 



In about 190 dwelling houfes, which is a little more than 4 
perfons to each houfe. One hundred and thirteen of the 
houfes are in what is called the country; the other 77 make 
the village or town of Ballantrae. The inhabitants of both 
town and country enjoy the comforts of fociety, in propor- 
tion to their circumftances, in a luperior degree to others in 
fimihir conditions of life. Thefe iatisfaftions are owing to 
various caufes, all contribuiing their mite to render thern 
healthy, eafy, and contented, and, in general, chearful. 

Climate, Difcafes^ ^c. — Their local fituation, a high, open-, 
and dry ioil, wiih upwards of 10 miles of fea coaft, expofeJ 
to the falubi ious breezes of the weftern ocean, together v/itii 
their rural employments, renders the inhabitants uncommon- 
ly hedlihy. Epidemical diftempers, excepting the commou 
diforders incident to children, are unknown. Deaths, except 
from particular accidents, are confined to infancy and old age. 
There are a greater number to be met with in this parifii 
dying above 80 years of age than in moft others. It is to bcf 
lamented that innoculation for the fmafl-pox is not more 
praflifed. Thei-e are very few families through the country 
part of the parilh, but what have a piece of ground niong 
with their houfe and yar'i, that enables them to keep one or 
more cows, and two or three flieep. The young of their 
cows, when a year old, felli for 30 s. or 50 s. which pays two- 
thirds of their rent. With the produce of their little piece 
of ground, furni/hing bread and potatoes, and the milk of a 
cow, together v/ith their own work, they are enabled to live 
comfortably, to clothe and educate their children decently, 
and to affiil in fetting them out in the world. The inhabi- 
tants of the village, which lies dofe upon the fliorCj enjoj:. 
advantages peculiar to their fituation. 

Rent, 



&amp;f Ballanirac. toy 

Rent, Produce, is'c.—The valued rent of the parifh is 
^•355* : I :6 Scots. It is believed that the real rent, in- 
cluding fifheries, is not much fhort of L. 2000 Sterling. 
The rent of arable land is from one to two guineas an acre, 
and of pafture, in its natural flate, los. and 12 s. an acre. 
The farms are of very unequal rent and extent, being from 
L. 10 to L. 115 a year. About 12,000 flieep, 3000 black 
cattle, a few fcores of goats, and perhaps 200 horfes, are kept 
in the parifli ; and 600 or 800 acres of the ground may be 
employed in tillage. Almoft the only crop is oats, with an 
acre or two of barley to ^ family, fome peafe, and generally 
as many potatoes as ferve the family twice a day for 7 or 8 
months in the year. Few or no cottagers are now employed 
by the farmers of tliis parifli in agriculture, nor have been 
for a long while part. A cottager's benefit, (2s it is called) is 
commonly from L. 10 to L. 15 a year ; the wages of a hired 
iervant is from L. 6 to L. 7 a year. Farmers who have graz- 
ing farms, upon which they do not refide themrc;lves, are o- 
bliged to employ cottagers to take care of the ftock upon 
ihem ; and it is confidered as fo defirable a fituation, that 
thole farmers who have occafion for married herds to take 
:;ire of their flock, have it generally in their power to make 
a choice. Ihe black cattle are of a fmall handfome kind: 
The cows, when fattened, weigh from 18 to 27 ftone. The 
iheep, when killed ofF the common open pafture, at 2 and 3 
years old, weigh from 30 to 50 lb. ihe chief ftaple com^ 
modity is raihng young cattle and Ihepp, The young cattle 
are for the molt part lold .to the grazier when halfjums^ that 
is,*when two years and a half old, and are changed from 
hand to hand till they are four or five years old, when they 
are fent up to Sr. Faith and Hampton fairs in England, and

Tlie wool of the fheep on thofe farms that lie between 
the tops of the mountains and the fea is generally very 
good, and of the fhcrt carding wool ; what is beyond 
them is more coarfe and fliaggy. It fells from 7 s. 6d. to 
ICS. 6d. per flona of 17 lb. Scots weight, equal to 25^- 
lb. Englifii weight ; the average price through the whole be- 
ing ps. for 25! lb. which is nearly 4^ d. per lb. This 
ihews the propriety of the farmers paying more attention to 
their wool than is generally done ; and it is believed that 
there are few lltuations more favourable to an improvement 
in that article than the firft mentioned clafs 'of farms in this 
parifh. Both the foil and the clim.ate are favourable. Ths 
foil is light, dry, and kindly, affording firm footing, a dry 
bed, and proper nourifliment to the flieep; the cool re- 
ffcfliing breezes from the fea during the fummer, prevent the 
bad effefts of immoderate heat upon the new fhorn wool ; 
and the ground during the winter feafon is very feldom en- 
tirely covered with fnow above two days together. If the 
farmers would take the trouble to introduce, from time 
time, fome good wooled ranis, and gradually cut ofi any 
coarfe wooled ewes that may be in their flocks, it is poflible 
to improve their wool to fuch a degree, as tha^ inflead of 
the very befi: of it being now fold at 10 s. 0 d. it might 
be fold at nearly thrcf times the price. This would pearly 
double the profits of their fheep on the whole, and at al- 
tnofl no trouble nor expence ; and it is perhaps the moft be- 
fiercial of all in':provements that they ever have it in their 
--.yer to iT!«kc'i\pon their far^ns.

' .Roads. — Till of late years there were fevv roads through the 
flilre of Air that were barely paflabie. About the year 1774 
an aft of Parliament was obtained, commuting the ftatute la- 
hour for an annual payment, at the rate of 25 s. for cverr 
L. 100 Scots of valued rent. Through the interior, more 
populous, and arable parts of the country the roads were 
ioon made ; and by the affiftance of government and a toll, 
one good road has been made through this parifh : But it is 
little more than a road of communication. The parifli wants 
crofs roads in different direftions, in order to enable them to 
lead lime in carts, of which there is plenty within half i 
mile of the extremity of the parifii : It is fold at the mode- 
rate price of 75 d. a boll or 2 Winchefter bufliels, and 70 or 
80 of thefe bolls are found perfe£lly fuClcient for an acre of 
this thin, light, dry foil. Some frnall experiments have been 
made in hming, which have fucceeded to the utmoft expec- 
tation. There are perhaps from 10 to 12,000 acres of land 
Jn the parifh that could be limed, and made fit for fock and 
fcythe ; and the fuccefsful attempts of individuals, it is to be 
hoped, will in time encourage the generality to follow the 
cj^ample. 

F'tperies. — A pretty confiderable river, named Ardftinchar, 
runs for about 25 miles through the country, and empties it- 
felf into the fea at the village of Ballantrae ; but it is rapid 
nnd fhallow, and can only admit of fm. 11 boats. At the 
mouth of this river there is a confiderable falmon fifhery, 
which yields a rent of above L. 80 a year. The falmon are 
thought as good as any in Scotland, and fell upon the fpot at 
I ] d. the lb. and it is but very lately they were rnore than 
I d. About 20 years ago there were great fhoals of excel- 
lent herrings that came upon the coaft at the end of harvefi: 
;nd beginning of winter, fince that time they appear only in

the fpring, about a league off; and though they are then fap 
from being good, they are fold to the country people in the 
neighbourhood from 20 d. to 2s. a hundred. There were 
formerly great quantities of haddocks and whitings at the 
fame feafon, but for a few years paft the prevailing fifhery is 
cod, with fome Ikate and ling. The cod and ling is fold 
from 4 d. or 6 d. ; the Ikate from i d. to i s. a piece, accor- 
ding to their fize and qualities ; fmaller fifh, as haddocks, &amp;c. 
from 6 d. to I s. a dozen. 

Price cf Provifions. — Though the' price of provifions is 
greatly Increafed within thefe 2o years, it cannot yet be faid 
to be high. Beef, mutton, lamb, and pork, (of which lafl: 
there is a great deal more reared than ufed in the parifh) 
formerly fold at 2 s. or 3 s. a ftone, now fells at 3 s. or 4 s. a 
fione ; hens 6 d.; chickens 2 d. ; eggs 2d. a dozen ; £kim- 
med milk cheefe 4 s. a ftone, Scots weight (24 oz. to the lb) ; 
butter ICS. 8 d ditto, of which there is not a great deal 
fold, as the practice of fmearing their fheep with tar and 
butter before the winter fets in univerfally prevails over all 
the country. 

Church — The living of Callantrae is L. 500 Scots of mo- 
rey and three chalders of vidtual, with a houfe and glebe 
v/orth L. 12 or L. 14 Sterling yearly. The prefent incum- 
bent was ordained in 1 77 1, and is the third minifter froni 
the Revolution. His two predeceflbrs each enjoyed the 
office about 40 years. He is married, and has a fon and a 
daughter. The church is at the north-weft extremity of the 
parifli, in the village of Ballantrae, it was built in 1604, and 
the manfc in 1736. and the repairs upon the manfe and oiE- 
ces fince that time has coft the heritors little more than L. 2q 
Sterling. 

Poor, 



6f Ballantrac, ''i-tX 

Ptfflf.— There is an excellent eftablifhment of a free fchoOl 
■at Ballantrae, for educating the poor. A native of the pa- 
rifti, about 40 or 50 years ago, left L. 400, the intereft of 
which film was appointed to run on, till there was a fufS- 
cieht fum to build a fchool-houfe, and a dwelling- houfe fo^ 
the maftgr, and from henceforward to pay the fchoolmafter ; 
and whoever fliould be appointed to the office, was to be 
bound to keep and leave the fchool and houfe in repair. Ac- 
cordingly a good houfe was built, and a large garden fet off. 
The patron of the parifli is patron of the fchool ; and by the 
deed he is entitled to prefent two-thirds of the fcholars, and 
the kirk-fcflion the other third. The mafter of this fchool 
is alio chofen parifh fchoolmafter, the lalary of which is a- 
bout L. 6 Sterling a year : He is alfo the feffion clerk and 
precentor for the time. All which offices, and the perqui- 
fites of them, together with the value of the houfe and gar- 
den, makes the place worth rather more than L. 40 Ster- 
ling yearly. The conlequencc of this is, that there is gene- 
rally a well qualified fchoolmafter, who is able to teach the 
languages, and the feveral branches of education fitting for 
bufinefs. From the nature of the fchool, and its fituation iu 
a country place, the number of the fcholars varies according 
to the feafon of the year. In fummer, when many of the 
poor fcholars and country lads retire to herding and laborious

AntiquH'ies. — ^The only ruins within the parifli is the rc- 
n^ains of an old church at the north-eaft extremitv of the: 
parifh ; it feems to have been formerly the parifh church, 
and deferted for the prefent one, as being more commodious 
for the inhabitants j it is called Kirkcudbright. And a large

old cafHe or dwelling adjoining to the village, and {ituated 
upon a high rock ; it is now within the minifter's grafs glebe. 
About a century ago it belonged to the Lords of Bargeny. 
There are no veftiges about it to difcover when it was built, 
or by whom inhabited. The minifter has been told, that 
the prefent Lord Hailes takes notice of it in fome of his tra£ls 
upon antiquities. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervatiovs. — The inhabitants labour under 
difadvantages. Their fituation might be meliorated. For 
the common occafions of life there are weavers, tailors, fl;ioe- 
xnakers, &amp;c. There is no manufadlures in the parlfli to iiH 
creafe the capital flock and promote circulation. Manufac- 
tures in carpeting, ftockings, bonnets, and fheep flcins might 
probably be eftablifhed with advantage. They have plenty 
of peat and turf for fuel ; but coals are at the diftance of 15 
or 16 miles by land, and when brought by fea are fubjecl to 
a duty of 3 s. 4d. a ton. The circumftances of the people 
have been increafing bnce the year 1782. That feaion of 
Icarcity, inftead of afFedting them in the manner it did other 
parts of Scotland, rather tended to better them. There was 
an exceffive growth of grafs in the fummer of that year, and 
the crops in this parifh and to the fouthward are in general 
early. That year they were reaped before the froft and the 
fnow fet in. The great plenty of hay made the cattle fell to 
advantage, and the almofl entire lofs of the crops in the in- 
land counties, occafioned the inhabitants of thefe counties to 
come to the foath and weft for feed for the enfuing feafnn. 
This gave them an idea of a corn trade, which, together with 
the increafing demand for live cattle fince tliat period, and 
confequent rife in their price, has niade a great alteration for 
the better in the farmers circumftances, and given a fpirit of 

improvement 



of Ballantrae, 113 

Improvement and demand for farms in a tenfold degree to 
what it ufed to be. 

The fliores abound with plenty of fine broad leaved rich 
fea-weed or wreck for manure; but there is very little of it 
ufed for kelp on the coaft of this parifli. The animals 
are thofe common to the weft of Scotland, hares, foxes, rab- 
bits, polecats, wild cats, groufe, partridges, plovers, wild 
ducks, and wild geefe. The migratory kind oblci ved are the 
woodcock, cuckoo, ftarling, fwallow, &amp;c. Among the mi- 
gratory animals may be mentioned the failfifli, which appears 
upon this coail the firft or fecond week of June, and conti- 
nues for three or four weeks. They meafure from 20 to 30 
feet long. The people of the village kill them with har- 
poons for the oil, which is made of the liver. The liver 
of a good fifh will yield from 40 to 50 gallons of oil, which 
they fell to tanners, &amp;c. and ule part of it themfelves to burn 
in place of candles. 

There are feveral mineral fprings in the parifh, which have 
been found beneficial in fcorbutic and other cutaneous difea- 
fes, and in complaints of the flomach arifing from acidity 
and want of digeftion. 

There Is no perfon in the parifli connected with the law, 
not even a conftable or fheriff's ofHcer, nor has there been 
any in the memory of the oldeft inhabitant. There is no 
juftice of peace in the parilli, nor within many miles of it ; 
and the fheriff's court is at the diflance of 36 miles. There 
is no furgeon or phyfician within a dozen miles, and it is 
doubtful whether half a dozen fucli parifhes would give bread 
to one.

Name, Situation^ Extent, Soil. 

TERREGLES is derived from Terra Ecclefiae, or Terre 
d'EgHfe. It is lituated in the ftewartry of Kircud- 
bright, and in the prefbytery of Dumfries, 6 miles from the 
fea-colt. It is about 5 miles long, and 3 broad j bounded by 
Holywood on the eaft, Froqueer on the fouth, Lochrutton on 
the weft, and Iron-Gray on the north. It confifts of a loam 
and fandy foil. Every kind of grain ufual in Scotland is 
produced in perfeflion. The rent of land, in general, is from 
12 to 25 {hillings per acre. Fhere are not above 12 princi- 
pal farmers employed in hulbandry.

Name, Situation, Surface, and /iir.cxiuG.'^n nvr 

THE antient name of this parifh was Etherharh, derived 
from Ether, the original name of Whitewater, and 
Ham, a village on its banks. Edrom is fituated in Berwick- 
fhire, prefbytery of Chirnfide, and fynod of Merfe and Tiviot- 
dale. It is about lo Englifh miles long and 6 broad. It is 
bounded by the parifhes of Dunfe, Langton, Polworth, Fog- 
go, Swinton, Whitfome, Hilton, Chirnfide, Prerton, and 
Bunkle. The appearance of the country is flat, except to- 
wards the Lammermuir or Cheviot Hills. A great part of 
the foil is fertile, and produces good corn when well culti- 
vated ; part moorilh and barren ; and part clay or fliallow. 
Formerly the air was moift, but is now confiderably dryer, 
on account of the inclofing and draining every part of the 
country. Lakes and pools of water are drained, and corn 
made to grow where the water flood. The air is falubrious. 
The beft proof of this is the longevity of the inhabitants. 
Several in the parifh have attained to 70, 80, and 90 years of 
age. The fevers, confumptions, and agues, which formerly 
prevailed here, were thought to have been owing to the 
moifture of the country. Since it was drained and inclofed, 

fevers

fevers and agues have cealed V(;ry much, and Inftead of ap- 
pearing every year, only come once in four or five years. 

Population. — The population of this parilh is believed to 
have been much lefs 50 years ago tha?i it is at prefeur. Agri- 
culture was not then in that flourifhing ftate in which it now 
is; and manufactures have only begun within thcfe 15 or 
20 years. From the decreet of locality for ftipend in the 
year i733» it appears that the number of catechiiable per- 
fons were near 800 ; and the whole, at that time, uiight 
amount to more than 900, or near 1000. About 13 years 
ago, they amounted to 1200 fouls. The following table will 
give fome idea of the population of this parilh in 1790 :

The number of horfes in the parifli is about 280, of fheep 
3000, and of black cattle 600. 

ManufaBures. — There is a paper-mill, a lint-mill, and a 
wheel-wright manufacture. Fifty-five perfons are employed 
in the paper-mill, 5 in the lint-mill, and about 5 or 6 in the 
Vifheel- Wright manufaftory. The wages paid per day in the firft 

is 



Staiiftical Accsunt 



is L. 2 : 15 : 0. The value cf the paper made yearly amounts 
to L. 5000 Sterling. When the wheel manufadure was 
carried on by James Small, 15 journeymen were employed. 
He introduced one of the heft ploughs made in Scotland. A 
variety of ufeful manufactures, efpecially linen and woollen, 
a cotton-mill, ftocking manufaiSture, and bleachfield, might 
be eftablilhed. There is abundance of fine flieep for wool, 
and a lint-mill is an encouragement to grow flax. There is 
plenty of fin6 water and corn to fupport manufadures Four 
hundred pcrfons might be employed by a linen and cotton- 
mill. 

Wages, Prices, and Poor. — A labourer's wages is lod. or 
1 s. per day ; mafons and carpenters is. 6 d. ; taylors 6 d. 
and their meat. The ufual wages of male fervants employed 
in hiifbandry is 50 s. or L. 3 per half year, Avith their board ; 
of female fervants 30 or 40 fhillings. All butcher's meat, 
through the greateft part of the year, is 3! d. and 4 d. per 
pound ; butter 8d. ; cheefe 3I d. if Scotch j En^hlh is 5 d.

their maintenance, is L. 10. Several of the poor are like- 
wife aflifted by the weekly colkdtions, kirk feffion fund,

Rent of Land. — The beft arable ground is 15 and 20 (lill- 
lings, and the befl: pailure 25 and 30 (hillings per acreis^The 
rent of feveral farms is L. 300, L. 400, L. 500, and L- 600

L. 20. The rent of the whole lands of the panfh is about

*^"'^'9f Edrom. I19 

'I/. 6493 Sterling per annum. From a decreet of locality ob- 
'tairied in 1733, it appears that the rent amounted then only 
to L. zooo Sterling yearly. One of the heritors marled and 
inclofed his whole ertate, and the rent rofe from L 500 to 
L. 1500 a year. Another marled the whole of his land, 
inclofed it with Itone dykes, and the rent rofe from L. 500 
to L. 1200 or L. 1300 per annum. Every ertate, within 
thefe 20 years, has rilen m proportion. Almoll: the whole 
of the pariih is inclofed. 

Church and Siipend.—HhQ church was built in 1732, and 
has been well repaired lince the preient incumbent was let- 
tied. The i'pirit of makmg churches neat and decent has 
fpread to the neighbou. iig pariflies. The ftipend, Including 
the glebe, is about L. 110 Sterling per annum. The crown 
is patron. 

Mineral Springs and Rivers. — There is one remarkable mi- 
neral fpring, called Dunje Well, in the eltate of ^l^b:t. It 
appears, that a number of gentry and nooility formerly re- 
forted to this water-, but it is fallen into difrepute Ih' re 
are two rivers in the pariOi, viz Whitewater and Blatkwater, 
commonly pronounced Whltiidder and Blakadder. White- 
water riles in the Lammermuir Hills, near the confines of 
Lothian, runs near 30 or 40 miles, and d'fcharges itfclf into 
the Tweed about 2 miles from Berwick. It abounds with 
fmall trout. A great number of falmon come up and fpawn n 
it. Blackwater rifes likewife in Lammermuir, above Green- 
law, and after a coiirfe of about 16 or 18 miles, falls into the 
■Whitewater, at a village called Allantown, in this pariHi. It 
is celebrated for as fine trout as any in Scotland. , 

Roads. — The roads are tolerably good. They have been

in the panftv for repairing them is about L. 115 Sterling 
yearly, by taxing every horfe at 7 s 6 d. and every cottager 
at I s. 6 d. I'here are few or no turnpikes, except on the

Situation^ Extent^ Sot/, and Surface. 

THIS parifh is in the county of Haddington, prefbyter/ 
of Dunbar, and fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale. Jt 
extends from the fea, on the north, about 12 miles foutli- 
wards. On the coaft, it is not above 2 miles broad, but gra- 
dually fwells towards the louth, and in ibnie places may 
be 5 or 6 miles broad. It is bounded on the weft by the 
pariflies of Spott and Dunbar ; on the fouth by Cranfliaws 
; and Longformacus ; on the eaft by Oldhamftocks ; and on the 
north by the fea. The face of the country is level, ai.d the 
foil rich. From the church towards the fouth the purilh is 
hilly ; and the hills partly green and partly heath. In many 
places on the coaft, the foil is rather light and gravelly. The 
fhore is rocky. 

Cidtivation and Produce. — That part of the parifh which 
is between the high lands and the lea Is perhaps about 2000 
or 3000 acres, and is employed in raifing corn, grafs, and 
turnip. There is very little of it in pafture. There are 56 

Vol. I. plough-

plough-gates * and a half in the parifh. Both Engllfii and 
Scottifii ploughs are ufed. The hilly part of the parifh is em- 
ployed chiefly in pafturing ftieep and milk cows. Soaie black 
cattle are fed for the market on pafture. The common, which 
was lately divided, confifted of 190c acres. Scarcely any flax 
is raifed for fal^. Wheat and barley are the principal grains.

country, the harveft being concluded there about the end of 
September, and frequently fooner. In 1779, ^^^^ finilhed 
by the 12th of September. The parifh produces more corn, 
and cattle fed on turnip, than is fufficient to fupply its inha- 
bitants. Farms are in general large, and increafing in fize. 
There are many inclofures, but little planting, at leaft very- 
few old trees. The redding heritors have begun to plant of 
late. One of them has planted 120 acres of common, or 
heathy ground. The rent of the parifh is about L. 4000 
Sterling at prefent, but probably foon be confiderably 
advanced. The old valuation is L. 9215 Scots. Land in 
this part of the country let formerly, at an average, at 
L. 1:11:6; but, according to the new leafes, at L. 2 : 10 : o 
per acre. There is fea-weed in great abundance ; to which^ 
rather than the natural richnefs of the foil, the high price of 
land on the caoft mufi: be attributed. There is, at an average, 
perhaps 25 or 30 ton of kelp made in a year. In 1782, the 
crop was very fcanty and late. Seed-time was not finiflied 
till about the beginning of June, nor harvefl till about the 
10th or 15th of November. Tradefmen, having meal to buy, 
were then in a much worfe fituation than the greateft pare of

The women's wages is 6 d. a-day for labouring at hay or tur-

being employed as hynds or plowmen, lot-men, &amp;c. ; all of 
whom are paid in grain. The lot- men threlh for the 25tli

mutton, &amp;c. are fold at Dunbar from 4 d. to 5 d. per lib. ; a 
couple of fowls now cofts from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. 

F'lpj, and Sea-Cca/l. — At prefent, only two fifliing boats be- 
longing to the parifh are employed in caching loblters, which 
is by far the moft profitable branch of fifhini- ; but great va- 
riety of other fifh is caught, fuch as cod, l;ng, turbot, had- 
dock, &amp;c. which are generally fcnt to Dunfe, Haddington 
&amp;c. It is probable that the current on this coa(l is ftronger 
than formerly ; for all the wrecks, about 15 or 16 in num- 
ber, that have happened within thtk \ 8 years, have been 
driven afliore nearly about the fame place At the • place 
where the iliips are always wrecked, there is a fmall creek, 
called Sketraw Shore, which feems to be intended by natu/e 
for a haroour. The making a harbour here would be of 
great advantage to the trade from Leith to London ; and par- 
liamentary intereft could not, perhaps, be employed better 
than in promoting fuch a fcheme. 

Church and St !pend. — The church was built m 1784; the 
manfe about the year 1726, and repaired m 1788, Accord- 
ing to z decreet pronounced in March 1 790, the ftipend, in- 
cluding tiie glebe, will, at an average, amount to L. 140 Ster- 
ling per annum. Mr NilLet of Dirleton is patron. 

Antiquities. — The remains of a chapel are to be feen on the 
ccaft. There is a fmall encampment on Blackcaftle Hill, 
feemlngly Danifli. There are two very beautiful tumuli, on 
the top of which have been burial places. Near one of them 
is a bridge of one arch, commonly called Edirkin, faid to be 



of hnerivtck* 

a corruption for King Edward, who is fuppofed to have built 
it. 

Mifcellaneotis Ohfervations. — The air is generally dry and 
healthy. There is a fpring-well, the water of which is re- 
markable for its lightneis. fhere are two free-ftone quar- 
ries. No coal is worked, but fmall feams are vifible in dif- 
ferent places. There is hme upon the coaft in great abun- 
dance, with a fmall feam of coal below it. The rent of cottages 
is from 15 to 20 fhillings. Coal is ufed as fuel on the coaft, 
peat and turf on the moors. The people are, in general, 
more cxpenfive in their mode of living than formerly. They 
are very humane to thofe who have been fhip-wrecked. There 
are many inclofures in the parifh ; but fome farmers think 
them difadvantageous, as they occupy too much of the high; 
rented corn land, and harbour birds.

Name, Situation , and Extent. 

THE origin of the name is uncertain'. The river of Lyne, 
which rifes at the 'Cauldftane Slaup, (a pafs over the 
Pentumds from Tweeddale to Weft Lothian) runs through 
this parifli, and probably Linton is fo called from being the 
town on the Lyne. Linton is fituated in the county of 
Tweeddale, and prefbytery of Peebles. Its contents may be 
about 2; i'quare niiks. It is bounded on the north by the 
pariflies of Mid-Calder and Kirknewton ; on the eart: by the 
parilh uf Pennycouk ; on the weft by the parifli of Ounfyre } 
aad the remaining part Dy Uolphington, Kirkcurd, and New- 
lands. 

Soil. — ^The foil of the hills is clayey, and they are covered 
'tvlth grafs, which feeds flieep for the butcher; the fheep, 
however, are fubjedl to the rot. The low ground near the 
North Ffk is a clay foil on a lime-ftone, but the land beino' 
high, is unfavourable to cropping. The remaining part of the 
hill ground is all covered wuh heath, with a fmall mixture 
of grafs, and is fitter for breeding than feeding, which, in ge- 
neral, 



of LhUn '-, 



neral, is the cafe with almoft all the pafture land in the pa- 
fifli. Except on the North Efk, the cultivated land is either 
a molTy foil, or a fandy loam upon a gravelly bottom, and 
remarkably adapted for the culture of turnip and potatoe. 
There are feme lochs in the lands of Slipperfield, belonging 
to Mr John Carmichael of Skirling, the largefl about a 
mile and an half Itnglifh in circumference. They have 
no outlet; the fprings feeming to equipoife the evapora.- 
tion. The water is niofs water. They abound in pike and 
perch, but contain no eels. In a loch in Eddlerfone parifli, 
in the county of Tweeddale, called the Water Locb^ there iii 
an outlet with a ftream which drives a mill ; at certain fea- 
fons eels are caught in abundance, in creels, at the outlet. 
The ftrean* falls into one of the Elk waters. Quere, Do eela 
migrate for fpawning to running water only, or do they go to 
the fea ? 

Climate. — Though the climate Is rainy, and the air moift, 
from the number of molTes, yet, being well ventilated, the 
exhalations never ftagnate or grow putrid, fo as to produce di- 
feafes. The high lands of Tweeddale and Lanarkfhire, are all 
fubjedt to harveft frofts, which often damage the crop. 1 hefc 
frofts are generally dreaded about the latter end of Auguft and 
durmg the month of September. Rainy weather about this 
time generally terminates in this kiiiu of froft, which, in the 
year 1784, deftroycd the whole barley crop m the month of 
Auguft. The higheft land is always tne lali in luffering by 
this kind of froft the loweft is in greateft danger. In a 
calm evening after rain this froft is always apprehended; 
when it fets in, a low white thick creeping vapour is obfer- 
ved to arife, after fun-fet, from the running waters and lo\v 
lying mofles, which gradually ipreads to a certain diii.'.nce, 
arid to a certain heighth, on the lands in the neighbourhood.

ftate, or where their baleful influence is not counteracted by 
particular circumftances. ihe half of a field contiguous to 
the running water or mofs is often deftroyed, while the more 
feniote half, on the fame level, or part equally near, but more 
elevated, remains fafe. In part of a field of potatoes in the 
line of the attra£l:ion of two mifts, the ftems became black 
and foft like foap, while the neighbouring drill remained 
green and vigorous, Thefe froft mifts manifeft their noxi- 
ous quality firft on the potatoe ftems, fecond crop of clo- 
ver, and peafe. It requires a greater degree of intenfity in 
the froft to hurt other crops : It fcarcely afFefts turnips. The 
ftems of the potatoes and clover grow black and foft, and fall 
down ; the leaves, and the pods of the pea, are fpotted with 
white fpots. The potatoe is fuppofed to grow no more, 
though the roots are fafe ; the peale, in proportion to their 
greennefs, are foft, wrinkled, and watery, become of the co- 
lour of a pickled olive, and acquire a difagreeabie fweetifij 
tafte : When threftied, the froft bitten are diftinguiftied from 
the found by throwing them into water ; the found fink, the 
others Iwim. A field of oats, when froft bitfen, acquires in 
a few days a blueifh caft ; and barley, if early frofted, as in 
1784, remains erert in the head, which acquires a redilli 
brown colour, or, if later, a de^clifh whitenefs. The kernels, 
when unhuflced immediately after the froft, are wrinkled, 
foft, and watery, and, after a while, grow fhriveled and dry. 
The kernel of frofted oats, even if threfhed in fpring, whea 
examined between the eye and the light, appears cloudy, and 
jiot of that uniform tranfparency which found grain poffef-

but its effeiTls are not obfervable till after fiTn-rifc. If wind 
arifes through the night to prevent the mifl: from fettling, or 
if the next day is cloudy, and efpecially if it rains before fun- 
rife, or if the field be fo. fhaded by hills from the riimg fun 
that the crop may be gently thawed by the increallng heat of 
the atmolphere before the fun's rays Ihme direftK on it, no 
danger is to be apprehended. In conformity to this expe- 
rience, a fmall field of potatoes has been known to be laved 
by fprinkling them with well water before fun riling But 
this can never be executed on a large fcale. Attempts havK 
alfo been made, though without fuccefs, to fave oats snJ bar- 
ley, by dragging fomething over them, before lun rife, to 
fhake ofF the hoar frcft, or ryme or cranreuch, as it is called, 
which is depofited wherever the n:iirt let tits, ihisfroftaf- 
feds the vegetation of corn only at a certain period of its pro- 
5rels. Pcafe are frolied however green in the grain, and the 
greener the more readily ; they are net killed by it when 
hard ripe ; but to this itate they leldom arrive at Linton. 
Parley and oats are not hurt by this frcrt when hard ripe, 
and fit for the hook 5 and it is probable that they are not 
liurt by it even though they are fhot, and the ear beginning 
TO fill, as long as the juices are watery, and have rot yet 
come to the confiftency of thickifh milk. It is certainly the 
cafe with oats. In the year 1784, the irofi: was on the ) 7th 
and 18th Auguft. The uppermoft grains of the cats, which 
always fill looneft, had thick milk in them, and were froited 
4 or s grains down the head. The grains below thefe all 
ripened wtll. The barley, which n;ight be about equally for- 
ward with the top grains of the oats, was totally deftroyed. 
Probably the upper- grains had fheltered the under ones from 
thefroll, the crop being very thick and flrong ; and this 
might have been the reafbn why the undermoil: grains ripen- 
ed : But as a proof, above all exception, that the fyrjl does mt 



130 Statl/ikal Account 

greatly hurt oats while the juices in the ear are water there 
were feveral contiguous fields Town with late fsed oats, whofe 
befi: ripened grains were no further advanced than the un- 
dermoft grains in the field above mentioned, and they all vi' 
pened very well, though equally expofcd to the froil. 

Dr Roebuck's experiments on o:its in 17S2 correiponds 
with this obfervation ; for, even the lafl parcel j(ie cut was 
not ripe when cut ; of courfe, it may be probably conjedhired, 
that, in the time of the froft, none of the oats in o^uelcion 
had liiick milk in the ear. 

Crops cut and flacked before the froft qre fafe, except 
peafe, the upper furface of whicii will froft till they be tho- 
roughly ripe. To fave them, it is ufual to turn the expofeJ 
fide downwards, to thaw gradually before fun-rife. 

This froft affefls only low grounds, and only hardens a 
very thin cruft on the furface of the earth. In 1782, the 
froft penetrated feveral inches into the ground, fo as to de- 
•ilroy the roots of the potatoes. 

Difenfes. — A man called William Badie, or Beatie, a fiioe- 
snaker, died a few weeks ago in Linton. About 16 or ij 
vears fince, being afHidled with ftomach complaints, contrac- 
ted by drinking cold water when overheated in harveft, he 
was advifed to fwallow ftones to help digeftion, after the 
manner of birds with mufcular ftomachs. He was ever after 
affiiflcd with violent ftomach complaints, and frequent vo- 
mitings, with a long train of nervous fymptoms. He never 
fufpe£ted that the ftones had lodged in his ftomach, till hap- 
pening to be feifed with a vomiting, lying acrofs a bed, witli 
his head and body reclined dowmvards, and fupporting him-

felf with his hands on the floor, fcvcral ftones came up. 
The man was of decent character ; and from his own, and 
his neighbours reports, there is no doubt of the faft. The 
largefl: (lone was the fize of a finger end. He threw up 13, 
\vhich, being the Devil's dozen, might probably be the num- 
ber fwallowed. Latterly, his furgeon made him vomit in 
nn inclined pofition, and he threw up fand, which probably 
had fallen from his victuals into Ibme lack formed in the fto- 
niach by the weight of the ftones. The Hones mull have 
been lodged in his Itomach for about 16 years. 

Mines, Alitierals, Springs, ts'c. — There is white free-ftone 
at Dcepfyke-head and at Spittiehaugh. The former quarry 
fupplies all Tweeddale. There is red free Hone in the ridge 
b{ Broomieleas, fupplying all Tweeddale with pavement flags. 

There is limefl:one at Carlops, and Whitefield, and Spittie- 
haugh, afforded in proportion to their relative fituation to 
the market, at lod. is. and i s. 1 d. per boll of fliells, at the 
hill. Two bolls of fhells is a good loading for a one horfe 
cart. A boll of fliells, when flacked, yields from two to 
three bolls oi lime. 

There is coal at Carlops and Coalyburn, fold, accord- 
ing to fituation, at 6 d. and 7 d. per 200 weight at the pit. 
Theieams are about feet thick, iucludi.ig a divilion ftone

There is a fpring lying north of Linton village about a

' Animals, ^c. — Befides the domeflic animals, and thofc 
common to the country, the earn eagle is foniefimes, but rare- 
ly, feen on the heights. The golden crefted wren and the 
bullfinch are but lately come. The woodpecker has very 
lately appeared at Newhall on the North Elk, where, pro- 
bably, we fhall foon have the brown fquirrel, which has ar- 
rived already at Pennycook, from the Duke of Buccleugh's 
menagerie. In winter, the huppoe, and fome unknown birds, 
fometimes vifit us. Our migrating birds are the fwallows, 
green plover, curlev/, fand hrk, a fmall wader frequenting 
runninjj water, and the red-fhank, and other two larger wa- 
ders frequenting lochs alfo the corn-craik and cuckoo ; thefe 
appear in fpring and leave us after midfumnier. The felt- 
fare and wild goofe appear in winter ; the woodcock comes 
in September or October, and foun leaves us. 

Plantations and JVoods, ^c. — Any large plantations of trees 
in the parifli are as yet only in their infancy. The larix 
feems to thrive in the poorefl foils and nnoft expoled fitua- 
tibns 1 heir durability in paling pofts, even when cut young, 
is well known. The natural wood is hazel, birch, mountain- 
afii, and willows. Birch is generally found in the mofles. 

No

No oak has occurred, except once a large one in a mofs near 
the top of Mendic Hill. The fheep prevent the growth of 
natural wood. The young (hoots ot heath, the year after it 
is burnt, is the great food of the fheep. If burnt in winter 
it dies. The time allotted by tht game laws for burning in 
rpring is too fliort, as heath is often too wet to burn in the li- 
mited time ; but flierifFi whoJcuow country affairs line tref- 
paffing farmers in moderation. There is a mofs plant with 
a white cottony head growing in mofTcs, which is the firlt 
fpring food of the fheep. It iprings in February, if the wea- 
ther is frefh. It is commonly called pull ling. The fheep 
take what is above the ground tenderly in their mouths, and 
without biting it draw up a long white ftalk. 

Grazing — ^There may, by a rough computation, be about 
10,000 fheep grazed in the parifh, 130 horles, and 460 cows. 
Swine are coming more and more into falhion, both among 
farmers and^ houfeholders, for family ufe. Cows are from 
20 to 20 Hone weight, yielding from 6 to 8 Scots pints of 
milk per day. I hey are kept moftly for family ufe, no at- 
tention being paid to dairy farming. The breed of horfes is 
much improved of late, particularly fince the introduction of 
two-horle ploughs, which are generally adopted. Englifh 
ploughs, with the curved moldbroad and correfponding fock, 
are coming into more general ufe, except for breaking up 
moor and bent. Small's plough is alfo coaiing into ule. A few- 
young horfes are reared from the plough mares for fale. Of 
late, year olds are fold from L. 6 to L. i o. Tue demand is 
greateft for the males, which, caete/ is paribus, draw from 30 
to 40 fhillings more than the females. A good flallion in 
the neighbourhood will be bou'',ht in at L, 40 or L. 50,^ 
and yield to his mafler a profit of from L. 15 to L. 20 annu- 

The 



1 3 4 Stail/iical Account 

The ftaple animal kept by the farmers is the fheep, ex- 
cepting a very few farms where the hills are green, and where 
lambs are fed for the butcher. The fheep for fale are hogs, 
i.e. fheep of one year old, fold off in June or July before they 
are fhorn. They are difpofed of to the Highlands, or Oichil. 
Hills in Fifefhire, at the Linton markets. The principal of 
thefe markets are two; the one held invariably on the third 
Wednefday of June old ftile, the other that day week. Between 
twenty and thirty thoufand fheep are generally fold at thefe 
markets annually, many being brought from other pariflies. 
Some of the Tv/eeddale fheep are fold at Stagfhaw, on the 
Englifh fide, and bought in by farmers to the Yorkfliire fells, 
whence, when older, they are fold to grazing farms farther 
fouth. The Highlanders keep what they buy for two or 
three years, then fell them fat to Perth, Glafgow, and Edin- 
burgh, about Martinmas j a confiderable number, too, are 
fent up to England. Till of late, the great demand to the 
Highlands was for wedder hogs ; lately, the demand was 
greateft for ewe hogs for breeding. The average price for 
thefe year old flieep at Linton markets, of late years, has been 
9 s. a head. The fuperannuated breeding ewes are either fold 
fat at Martinmas to the butcher, at about 9 s. a head, or elfe 
fold with iamb, in the month of March, to the Lothian parks 
at IIS. 

The duration of a breeding ewe varies, in different farnw, 
from 4 to 7 years. The farmer, when fmearing them at Mar- 
tinmas, examines their teeth and their eyes, and from thence 
judges whether he ought to keep them on his farm anotheS* 
year. When a farmer quits his farm, the new incomer knows 
that it is highly dangerous to bring in a breeding flock which 
has not been bred on the farm, and generally takes the breed- 
ing flock on the farm at from 14 s. to i6s. a head. Rams 

being 



of L'lnian, 135 

being unprofitable, the leaft pcffible number of them is kept. 
From 40 to 50 ewes are generally allotted to one ram through, 
Tweeddale, according to the poornefs or richnefs of the pafr 
ture. An old fat breeding ewe from the hill grounds weighs 
from 6 to 8 pounds avoirdupoife per quarter, yielding from 4 
to 8 pounds of Tallow. 

The Tweeddale wool is in general coarfe, and fells at pre- 
fent, if the {heep are waflied, at an average of 6 s. per ftone 
Tron. It ufed formerly to go all to Stirling for carpets, ftial- 
loons, &amp;c. ; but of late it is bought much by Hawick people ; 
part is fent to Hawick, part to Leith, where it rs fliipped for 
England. Attempts have been made in Tweeddale, and in 
fimilar grounds in Annandalc, to improve the wool, by the 
introdudlion of Bakewell rams ; but it is univerfally given up j 
the breed produced being, as is reported, a foft dull animal, 
always loitering in low grounds, unwilling to climb heights, 
nnd too fpiritlefs to remove the fnow with its feet to obtain 
food in winter. The chief food of the fheep in winter is the 
grafs which in fLimmer they rejeft, and allow to grow to its 
projK'r height. The common breed here is a fliort tailed com- 
pacl bodied flieep, with black faces and legs. The flieep are 
iill fmeared at Martinmas with a mixture of tar and train oil, 
pr Orkney butter. Butter is preferred to train oil. 

A ftone and an half of butter, and 1 2 Scoto pints of Norway 
tar, is reckoned, in general, the dofe for 80 old flieep ; 1^ 
fiones of butter, and i2 pints of tar, is the dofe for 50 year 
olds, or 60 two year olds. John Murray farmer in Buccam, 
in the parifh of Galafliiels, fays, that when in EHbank, in Sel- 
kirkfliire, he was unfuccefsful in his competition for the pre- 
nilum granted for wool ; he next feafon Imeared entirely with 
jjutter v.'ithout tar, and eafily gained the premium. The 

Highlanders 



135 Staiiflkat Account 

Highlanders and Yorkfliire- people prefer hogs !n proportion 
to their blacknefs, thinking they are harily bred in high or 
nioffy land. This may be a reaion of in. earing hogs heavily. 
There is no getting a very (atisfailory account of Imearing 
from the farmers : Some fay it forms the wool into a wax- 
clotii, keeping the fheep warm and dry ; foine fay the tar is 
necefTary for this purpoie ; John Murray, before mentioned, 
apprehends the butter iu£Iiciet)t for thi . purpoie, and that the 
tar is only neceffary to k'li vermin. Some farmers keep a 
few (lieep perfeftly unfmeared, for pettycoats and llockings j 
they fay they have perhaps more wool ; but they think the 
wool degenerates in quality and quantity the fucceecimg year j 
and even the firft year tne expenmtnt is not fair, as they al- 
ways fclctt for the purpule tnc itrongeft and fatteft flieep of 
the fiuck. They apprehenJ, too, that they fail fooner. 

The greateft improvement that has been lately introduced 
in fheep fanning is light llocking. The flieep are better, 
and the ri(k of death is alio by that means diminiihed. it is 
not pradlicable by any other means than light flocking, to in- 
creafe the winter food of the fheep through i weeddale ; the 
arable land bearing fo very inconfiderable a proportion to the 
hill ground. Plantations, in different parts of the fheep farms, 
would t^c of great ufe for protedling the fheep from florms j 
but on a 19 years leafe, which is the ufual term, no fanner 
will plant. On the 57 years leafes lately granted by the Duke 
c-f Queenfberry, farmers are planting trees for this purpofe at 
their own expence. In fome of the breeding farms in Lin- 
ton, the farmer keeps a ftock of breeding ewes ; of their lambs 
he keeps a part, to replace the fuperannuated ewes and rams 
which he annually fells off. He feledls the beft for that pur- 
pofe : He alfo keeps a portion of the next beft lambs for fell- 
ing as hogs next year to the Highlands. The worfl: portloa

vctf" the lambs he fells to a fecond clafs of farmers, who annu- 
ally buy in lambs, and fell them all again next year as hog&amp; 
to the Highlanders. A third clafs of farmers have a breed- 
ing ftock of ewes \ of their lambs they keep juft as many as 
are fufficient to replace the breeding ftock ; the reft they fell 
to the fecond clafs of farmers. A few farmers keep a ftocjc- 
of breeding ewes; they fell all their lambs fat to the butcher, 
except what is necelfary to keep up the breeding ftock. One 
or two farmers who have low and improved land keep no 
ihcep through winter, but buy in ewes with lambs in March, 
fell off the fat lambs in fummer, and fatten the mothers on 
grafs, felling them at Martinmas, or feeding thein ftill farther 
©n turnips. 

This laft mode of farming is in its infancy at Linton. It 
.was introduced by James M'Dougal in Linton, a very intel- 
ligent man, who was 14 years with Mr Dawfon at Frogdep, 
about the time he commenced his improvements, firft as a 
fervant and then as au overfeer. He has been about 1 2 years 
in a L. 50 farm at Linton. Mr Laurence Tweedie, lately 
come ro the farm of Slipperheld near Linton, is adopting his 
mode of culture. He has an extenfive ftieep farm of the firft 
defcription, but brings down his fuperannuated breeding 
-ftock to be fed off on turnips on his low lands. James 
M'Dougal buys in his ewes in March wifh lamb; feeds off 
the lambs on hill ground which has been laid doAvn with 
white clover. The ewes which have miffed lamb, and thofe 
whofe lambs were firft fold off, as they grow fat on the grafs, 
are fold at Martinmas ; the reft are brought down to the 
turnip, and fold about the middle of January. Before he 
pra£lifed feeding on the turnip, he fold all off at Martinmas, 
and reckoned himfelf well paid if he cleared 5 s. a-head for 
;the lambs, and loft nothing by the ewes. The turnip im- 

VoL.L S . proves

proves the ewes about 2 s. d d. or 3 s. a-head, which is 3 
profit of L. 2 : 10 : o, or L. 3, from the acre of turnip, aq 
acre feeding a fcore, befides the advantage of the dung and 
paddling on a light Tandy foil. The fiieep arc inclofed in ^ 
web of net ftretched on a paling, their horns are fawn oHfi 
in frefli weather, without injury to the ani trial ; in wet wea- 
ther they arc allowed to go at large. They thrive fallen 
•when at large; but the turnip are fooner confumed, as they 
lun to the frelh ones, and leave thofe that are half eaten. 
Turnip fucceeds beft at Linton when fown in the latter end 
of May. 

The principal difeafes of flieep are, ift, Iliac paffion or fick- 
Bcfs. It attacks the fatteft, when firft let down to the ftubblcs, 
and ground allotted for their winter proyillon ; It is cured, 
vhen taken in time, by bleeding and purging. Turnips, or 
clover ftubble, are faid to cpre it ; probably by occalioning a 
loofenefs. 2d, A diarrhoea, which attacks them in fpring,

"When the lambs are weaned, the ewes are milked for a 
longer or lliorter time, according to the richnefs of the paf. 
ture; and the milk, mixed with the cow milk of the farm, 
is made into cheefe, which (ells at about 6 s. per ftonc Tron,

An ihtelligfent herd knows all his flieep from perfohal ac- 
quaintance, called head mark^ and can fwear to the identity of 
a flieep as he could to that of a fellow fervant. The artificial 
mark made with a hot iron On the nofe, or with a knife on 
the ears, he confiders as a very equivocal mark of identity, 
like the cut or colour of a cot in the human ipecies. 

Corn Farming.— -The difi'erent fpecies of oats fown at Lin- 
ton are ranked as follows, according to their different degrees 
of earlinefs : 1 ft, Magbiehill oats, or barley oats, introduced 
by Mr William Montgomery of Magbiehill. 2d, Carnwath 
oats from the moors of Carnwath: They are I4 days latter 
than the Magbiehill. 3d, Late feed oats from Twcedfidc, 
10 or 14 days latter than the Carnwath oats. They will 
grow on worfe foil than the Magbiehill, but require ftrong- 
er foil than the Carnwath. A prejudice long prevailed, but 
is now given up, that the meal of thefe was better than that 
of the Magbiehill. 

The Lothian pea does not ripen in any year at Linton. 
The Peebles grey pea ripens fometimes if fown in March, 

There 



Siatt/lical Accourd 



There is a Magblehill pea, procured by the Lord Chief Ba- 
ron's father. The peafe crop is always precarious at Linton, 

The land under the plough in Linton parifli may amount 
to 700 or 800 acres, of which two- thirds may be outfield *. 

The outfield is teathed by folding the black cattle in fum- 
iner over night, to keep them from the corns, and by folding 
the ewes when they are milked. The folds are fometimes 
limed m Qdober, after the cattle are houfed : The land is 
then ploughed ; the lime falls to the bottom of the furrow, 
but is brought up again by ploughing deeper next fealon. 
Three crops of oats is reckoned moderate cropping after a fold. 
On new liined folds fome farmers take four oat crops, then a 
crop of peafe, which will grow on outfield after lime, though 
not otherwife, then another crop of oats : The land is then' 
kft to gather fod as nature fliall direft. Twenty boils of 
Ihells, or at moft twenty-four, is the dole for an acre. 

The croft land f is varioufly treated. The approved ro- 
tation introduced by James M*Dougal is a rotation of four,^^ 
viz. turnips with dung ; then barley or Magbiehill oats fown 
with grafles •, then a crop of hay ; then Magbiehill oats. If 
the turnips arc eaten on the field by fheep, this ftill farther 
enriches the land ; fo that, in all probability, at the next go- 
ing over, half the dung might be fufficient to raile a good 
turnip crop, and fet the rotation agoing. 1 he fpare dung 
might be employed in converting fome of the outfield into 
«roft. Under this rotation of four, potatoes are raifed in 
ftripes through the turnip field ; fo that the land is dunged 
and paddled by the iheep which eat the turnip.

The depopulation feems to be owing to fheep farms being 
rented to people who live at a diftance ; the houfes of thefe 
farms being inhabited only by the herds inftead of the far- 
mer's family. Another circumftance muft be attended to, 
viz. that, in 1777^ Sir William Montgomery was making 
large improvements on his eftate but at prefent there arc 
fewer labourers in the neighbourhood ; and it is obfervable, 
that the greateft number of empty houfes are near Sir Wil- 
liam Montgomery's eftate. Lord Hyndford alfo carried on 
many improvements, but at his death thefe improvements 
ceafed.

The people are either farmers, or mechanics and fhop- 
^eepers ; generally one, anjd foiuetimes two furgeons ; for- 
merly an excifeman ; lead carters and carriers i no lawyers. 
Two or three looms work cotton cloth independently, or 
linen for the manufaa^rers in Edinburgh, or even Glafgow. 
There are about two dozen of looms in the village. 

In the memory of old people, the mode of living is much 
altered. The great expence formerly was in drinking two- 
penny. The farmers ate no flefli but what died of itfelf ; 
onions was a common relilh to their bread. Their clothas 
were homefpun and coarfe. More flefh is now confumed 
even by cottagers, than formerly by farmers. 

The fituation of every clafs of people is much improved. 
Even within thefc few years labourers wages are confiderably 
raifcd. A good ploughman gets L. 6, and meat in the houfe •, 
or 6i bolls of meal, and L. i : 6 : o annually, inftead of meat. 
If he marries he gets a houfe, for which his wife Ihears all 
harveft with his mafler, who drives in her fuel, and gives her 
land for hnt or potatoes. She generally gets offalls of milk 
and whey, &amp;c. if flie is hked. A good fervant maid has L. 3 
per annum. 

Day labourers have 8 d. in fummer and 6d. in winter, 
with viftuals ; women at out-work 3 d. but oftner 4 d. with 
yiftuals. In harveft, men get 10 d. women 8 d. with vic- 
tuals. Taylors 66. and visuals. Mafons and joiners arc 
over-proportioned to other labourers, from the demand to 
Edinburgh, and get i s. with visuals. Few enlift, as they 
have plenty of employment at home. Some fix or eight may 
have emigrated to America ; they write flattering accounts 
tP their friends, bu( com|lain of their dillance from religious 

ordinances.

There are no other religious feftaries in the pariflb. 

Pcor. — There are no poors rates in the pariih. They arc 
fupported by coUeclions at the church doors, by dues at pro- 
clamations, and dues for mort-cloths kept by the kirk-fef- 
fion. In 1773, a legacy of L. 100 was left to the poor} be- 
fore that they had one of L. 25. This ftock is at intereft at 
S per ceni. In 1783, the trealurer had above the annual in- 
come a balance, which was then expended, with fome chari- 
table collections and private donations, amounting to near 
L. 30. In that year the feffion did not buy meal and retail 
it at an under rate, but gave their contributions in money. 
In other parifhes, wbere the kirk-feffion bought and retailed

meal at an under rate, the retail trade was knocked up, and 
tradefmen who were not on their lill had to travel to Linton 
for meal. The feflion never admitted any poor to reg'^lar 
penfions ; but the treafurer, who was the minifter, gave oc- 
cafional fupply, by the advice of difcreet people in the parifli.

From the above may be deduced about L. 1:4:0, which

prefbytery and fynod clerks, and officers. 

In 1782 — 3, people were fometimes difcovered living on 
nettles, or potatoes, without meal, and were relieved ; par- 
ticularly one poor houfeholder, a day labourer, who was re- 
ported to the minifter as lick and Itat ving. He was found 
exhaufted with hunger ; and laid, that he felt an o'ercafing at 
his hearty and hts lights were ay ready to lof'. the f -ff. Some 
Port wine, and a fupply of meal, put him in heart, and made 
him fit for work. The people lived then moitly on very 
wholefome white peafe, brought from Leith.

made, and now upheld, at 50 fhillings per m.ile, which is all 
the money that can be allowed above paying the interell of 
borrowed money, and without any linking fund to extinguifli

at 4 d. for a day's work of a man. 

Aritiquilies. — When the old church was taken down in 
5781 or 1782, it appeared to have been built of the ftones of

there is no tradition. Near Spittleliaugh is a park called 
Chapelhill; there are no remains nor tradition of a buii-li- g ;

By the Rev. Mr FiNDLATER.</head>

Situation, Soil, 

NEWLANDS is fituated in the fhire of Tweeddale and 
prefbytery of Peebles. It is bounded by the pariflies 
of Linton, Lyne, Kirkhurd, Stobo, Eddleftone, and Penny- 
cook. The face of the parifli is diverfified with hills and val- 
leys. The hills are in general clayey, more or lefs mixed 
with ftones. The arable 1 aid is in general a clay loam, up- 
on a clofc impervious tilly bottom. It is liable to poach in 
winter, and therefore nut fit for turnip flieep feeding. 

There is fcarcely any heath in the parif?!. The paftures are 
all green ; and white clover abounds where the land has beea 
limed. Trees thrive every where, and thorn hedges grovr 
very well. In high expofed hruations, on fpouty clay foil, the 
oak feems to thrive better than any other white wood ulually 
pliiited among evergreens, as on a hUl top above Romanno, 
From the Whcam to iVlootJiill bridge, the land is all enclo- 
feci and well wooded. Larix and other firs of a large fize are 
to be ieen at Lamancha and Wheam : At the latter, filver fir 
was lately cut which aftbrded planks of 27 inches. 

Springs^ 



of Newlands4 149 

Springs, Mittes, and Minerals. — Chalybeate fprings abuand 
every where. There is red free-ftone in Broomyieas ; and 
from Romanno down the Lyne whin ftone abounds. Froin 
Noblehoufe to Whcam the hills abound in iron-or and iron- 
ftone, on which trials have been made, but hitherto without 
fuccefs. At Wheam, Lamancha, and Migbiehill, there is 
lime and coal. About that end of the parifh there are alfo 
ochres, red and yellow, veins of man j,anefe, and Stourbridge 
clay. A manufuftnry for converting ochre into paints is car- 
ried on by the Honourable Captain Cochrane at Lamancha, 

Farming.— The whole land in tillage maybe 1300 Scots 
acres, of which the outfield may probably be only one- half or 
three- fifths. Ploughing is moft'y performed by four horfes; 
in the lighter foil by two. At Scotftown, two ftout oxen are 
trained to plough, yoked like hories, and feem to anfv/er 
Very well. 

There may be 230 horfes, young and old, in the parifh 5 
600 cows, conlifting of dairy cows, and young ones coming 
up to replace the old ; befides about 100 more fed on fatten- 
ing grafs, or reared on coarfe breeding ground; and 3000 
Iheep. Young horfes are bred for Hiie from the plough 
mares. 

Almoft the firft dairy fafming in Tweeddale was begun in 
Wefter Deanfhoufes, by Thomas Stevenfon, the prefent te- 
nant. The- farm lies on the oppofite fide of the hill from. 
Wheam. The farmer had the advantage of a houfe fitted 
tip for himfelf by the Lord Chief Baron, when Sheriff of 
Peebles, with more conveniencies than ufual for farm houfes. 
Tempted by thefe advantages, and the vicinity to Edinburgh, 
the farmer turned his attention to cows, and found the 

fchemc 



150 Statijlical Accourii 

fcheme profitable. His example was foon followed ; and ex- 
cept in the fliecp farms, all the farmers pay either the wholcj 
or a conficlerable part of their rent, by their milk cows. The 
produce of a cow maybe, at a medium, L. 3:10:0, or, 
where very particular attention is paid, L. 4 : 10:0. The 
cows are, at an average, from 16 to 30 ftones weight. The 
cows being generally houfed, their dung is carried to crofts 
in the vicinity, which occalions the proportion of outfield to 
croffland to be lefs here than in the neighbouring parifh of 
Linton. 

The fheep are all fold fat ; lambs at about 6 s. a-plece ; 
old breeding ev/es, at Martinmas, about us.; the wool about 
1 s. per ftone dearer than at Linton. Scarcely any ewe milk 
cheefe is made for faie in the parifh. 

Population. — From a vifitation of the parilh, begun 13th

has received feveral additions and repairs within the laft ten 
years. 

Poor. — The poor are fupported from a flock of L. 80, fe- 
cured on a bond of the trullees for the roads at 5 per cent. 
and from voluntary contributions, and dues for proclamation 
and funerals, without poors rates. The annual average ex-

The difference from year to year in the lalt period is iacon- 
fiderable : The L. 80 ftoclc having been got within that pe- 
riod, the 'poor were probably more liberally treated. In 1782 
i — 3, meal was bought in by the leflion, and fold at an under 
rate. Some heritors maintained all the poor on their own 
lands. The roads in Newlands are under the fame afl as in 
Linton, and ftatute labour commuted at the fame rates.

Situation, Extent, i3'c. 

THIS parifli is in the county of Wigton, prefbytcry of 
r Stranraer, and (ynod of Calloway It is bounded oa 
the north by Stonnykirk panfh ; from which, to the louther- 
jnoft point, or the Mull of Galloway, it is -about lo miles 
long; on the weft it'is bounded by the Irifli Sea; on the eaft 
by the Bay of Glenluce ; and is about 2 miks broad. The 
general appearance of the parifh is hilly. Moft of the flat 
grounds produce good crops of corn. 

Bays, l^c. — Mary-Port, thought to be called fo in honour 
of the Virgin Mary, is a fmall bay on the eaftern fhore, 
which is thought a iafe anchoring place when the wind blows 
from the weft. But Drumore, where (hips of burden fre- 
quently put in, in bad weather, is the fafelt of any in the pa- 
rifti. Befides thefe there are Curgie and Kilftay Bay. There 
was once a pier at the Bay of Port Neffock ; but it is now in 
ruins. This would be a comnsodious place for fhipping, if a 
good harbour were built. Ships anchor with farety wiiea 
the weather is ftormy from the eaft. On this ftiore, towards 
the fouth, in the warm feafon of the year, there is a va-

riery of marine plants growing at the foot, and on the cliffs 
of the rocks, i'here is a fea weed, of which a confiderable 
quantity o\ kelp is made. Samphire grows in confider. bic 
plenty, and is gathered for pickling. In going from Weft 
Tarb rt to the point of Mull, there rifes a very bold and ele- 
va ed coaft. It is about the extent of a mile, and projects it- 
fclf as the botmdary between the Irifh Sea and the Bay of 
Lure. In a high wefterly w nd, a prodigious fwell and weight 
of le.i rolls around that point. It is awfully grand. Here 
tlie icvi has formed caverns, which are rendered dreadful by 
a fetting in tide and a ftrong wefterly wind. The noife is 
like loud clap of thunder. On the extremity of the point 
in 1 fine day, there is a charming profpeft of the north of 
England, Ifle of Man, Ire. and, Sfc. Ships pafs and repafs 
this point from lingland, Ireland, and the Wi ft of Scotland. 
There have been feveral wrecks. It feeuis to be a proper 
Ctuation for a light-houfe. There is abundance of fifh every 
where on the coaft, of good quality and great variety. 
The fiieU-fifli, oylters and lobfters, are very good of their 
kind. 

Produce, i^c. — This parifti abounds in corn and catt4e. 
Potatoe? and other vegetables are plentiful. The farmers 
ky their accoutit vith paying one half of theIr rent by the 
fale of cattk, and the other half by corn. Barley and oats 
thrive in this foil and climate, and their quantity is con- 
lid'rable. The farmers export annually betvireen 200 and 
300 bolls, Linlithgow meafure. The boll of barley fellg

the farm- of the Mull. It was fiipiibfed to have been dedi- 
cated to the Virgin Mary. The prelent one is iiiore centrical, 
and was built A. D, 1633. The Earl of Stair is patron. 
There are two other heritors ; but only o-^e of theiti relides. 
The ftipend has not yet been augmented, and is only 55 1. to s. 
\?ithout any vidtual. The glebe is. conHderably flaort of.being 
legal. At the public fchool, Englifh, writing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, navigation, and a Uttie Latin, are taught. The 
liilpry is 100 merks, atnd L. 2 : 8 : o - Sterling, for educating 
12 poor hoys, out of a mortified fund. Englifh is taught at 
1 5. the .quarter ; writing and arithmetic at is. 6d. . With 
the emoluments of precentor and feffion clerk, tlie income 
Will not exceed L. ty or L. 18 Sterling Near the northern 
extremity of the parifh. is another khool; the falary about a 
guinea, and L. i : o Sterling for teaching 8 poor boys, 
out of the fame mortified fund. There is generally a third 
fchool, without falary, in winter, at the fouthern extremity 
of the parifh. In both thefe laft, education is at i s. the 
quarter ; and the mafters have the privilege of going about 
with the fcholars, and lodging with their parents. The 
aumber of the fcholars at the three fchools, taken together, 
may be about 120. 

Poor^ — The poor belonging to this parifli are well pro- 
vided. BefiJcs the ordinary collections, there are the foUow- 
inp funds. Mr Andrew M'Murray merchant in London left 
L. 100, the yearly intereft of which is to be applied to the 
benefit of the Ichoolmalter, for educating 20 poor boys, na- 
tives of this parifh. The late Andrew M'Dowal, Efq; Lord 
Bankton, one of the Judges of the Court of Seffion, left to 
the poor of this parifh L. l©o. The yearly interefl is divided 
among them. The late William Adair, Efq; of Flixton, 
left to the poor L, 400, 3 per cent, confol. annuity. Thefe

three gentlemen were born in this pariffi, and have left a me*

: Price of Labour and ProviftonSf i^c. — Servants wages have 
rifen a third within thefe few years. Female fervants who 
got 20 s. per hall year now get 30s. or more; male lervants, 
who formerly got L. 2, or L. 2 : 10 : o per half year, now 
get L. 3 : 3 : o, or L. 3 : 10 : c ; lo;ne ge: L. 4. A day-la- 
bourer's wages is 6d. with, and lod. or is without victuals. 
The price of poultry is pretty reafonable ; butcher meat is 24d. 
per lb. when plentiful; when fcarce, it rifes confiderably. 
There is no marltet nearer than Stranraer. The ale-houfes 
in this parifh were numerous till of late ; but the new regu- 
lation of licenfing the hotfes of peribns of a fair character, 
it is to be hoped, will be attended with the happiefl: confe- 
quences. There are three of thele houles hcenled in this 
parifli. 

Mifcellamous Ohfervaticns. — There is plenty of whin-ftone 
in the parilh. Ihe flate quarries are thought valuable, if 
properly wrought. A good deal of the flate is lent to mar- 
ket. There are feveral caves, curiofities of their kind ; iri 
one of them there is a petrifying water, which drops from 
the roof. In another on the eaftern fliore, according to tra- 
dition, a hermit lived. The fuel here is pe-xt and turf ; and 
thefe are fcarce, as much of the moor ground has been con- 
verted into arable land. The winter is generally moderate. 
The air is reckoned very wholefome. More flax is raifed 
than formerly ; and the ground is proper for it. A lint-mill 
erected in the parifa would be a farther encouragement. The 
farmers bring their lime from Whitehaven or Ireland, and 
pay IS. 2d. per Carlifie bufhel, which is three Winchefler 
bufhels. Th« trulleei are making every exertion to put the

Name, Situation, Extent^ Soil, isfe. 

TINWALD, fuppofed to be deiived from the Gaelic, 
and fignifying the harbour, or from the daAon, the 
houfe in a 'wood, is fituated in the county, fynod, and pf (by- 
tery of Uuii.fries. 'J'ra Iflat, probably too of Gaelic extrac- 
tion, and fignifying a fiOping ivet fide, was- joined to Tinwald 
in 1650. Tlie form of thefe united pari flies is nearly an ob- 
long of about 6 miles by 4. The parHh of Kirkmahoe ir the 
boundary on the north and north-wefl:; Dumfries and For- 
therwald on the fou^h and fouth-weft; Kirkmichael and 
Lochmaben on the ead: and fouth eafl:. The water of Ae 
feparates the parifli from Kirkmichael. Ir is a pleafant ftream, 
abounding in trout, and fea-fifli in their feafon. It falls into 
Annan a little above Lochmaben. The parifh is feparated 
from Kirkmahoe and Dumfries on the weft and fouth-weft 
by a fmall ftream called Lochar, which, about a quarter of a 
mile below this, enters into an extenilve mofs, called Lochar 
JVIofs, II or 12 miles in length, and in fome places 3 in 
breadth. It fuppl-es the inhabitants of Dumfries, and the 
furrounding neighbourhood, with fuel. There was a fcheme, 
about 30 years ago, to cut a canal from Solway Frith to 

Lochar- 



1 6# Staiijikal Account 

Lochar-bridge at the head of this mofs. There is only a fall 
of 1 4 feet from it to the fca. The eftiniate of the expence 
is faid to have been L. 10,000. Btffides the benefit arifing 
from a communication with the Tea, the greateft part of this 
extcnfive morafs would have been rendered arable, or fine 
meadow ground. In its prefent ftate, indeed, there are 
confiderable trails of excellent meadow along the banks of 
rivulets which run into it from the high grounds on all fides. 
There are likewife feveral good farm;, in different places on 
the higher parts of the mofs, on both fides of Lochar, which 
divides it nearly into two equal parts. There is a tradition, 
univerfally credited, that the tide flowed up this whole traifl 
above the higheft bridge in the neighbourhood. In the bot- 
tom of the mols fea-mud is found •, and the banks are evi- 
dently compofed of fea-fand. A f''w years ago, 3 canoe of 
confiderable fize, and in perfeci: prefervation, was found by a 
farmer, when digging peats, 4 or q feet below the furface, 
about 4 miles above the prefent flood-mark ; but it was de- 
ftroyed before any Antiquarians had heard of it. Near the 
fame part of the mofs, and about the fame depth, a gentle- 
man found a veflel of mixed metal, containing about an Eng- 
iifli quart, fuppofed by fome to be a Roman modiusy and by 
others to be of much greater antiquity, as the Phoenicians, 
according to tradition, traded with tlie natives for tin, feveral 
hundred years before the Romans had dikovered the ifland. 
The veflel is ftill preferv^ d. Antiquities of various kinds are 
found in every part of this mofs where peats are dug, even 
near its head, fuch as anchors, oars, &amp;:c. ; fo that there is no 
doubt of its having been navigable near a mile above the 
higheft bridge, and fully 12 miles above the prefent flood 
mark. Near the manfe there is a narrow gut, between two 
fandy hillocks, called Collyveat, fuppofed to be a corruption 
of Collin's boat, where it is thought there was a ferry, which 

indeed 



of Tiniuald. 



Indeed would be very neceflary, on the fiippofition of the 

itide flowing there. Lochar, after a courfe of 1 1 or 12 miles 
below this, falls into the Solway Frith. It abounds with 
pike. The moft of this parifh is arable. The fouthern part 
is much more fertile than that which lies towards the north 
and eaft ; and the harveft, in general, is three or four weeks 
earlier. The fouthern part is of a deep dry loamy foil, and. 
produces wheat, barley, and oats, of the beft quality. i lic 
north- eart: part produces all thefe, though of an inferior qua- 
lity, the foil being moftly wet, and lying on a bed of till. 
A gentle rifing ridge, running from north to fouth, divides 
the united parilh. 

Air and Dijlempers. — The air, in general, is dry, and rec- 
koned healthy. Ihere have been no prevalent diftempers 
during thefe laft 30 years. The meafles are fometimes fatal, 
efpecially to adults ; but they feldom appear above once in 
10 or 12 years. The fmall-pox was juftly dreaded about 
20 years ago; but, as innoculation is now generally adopted, 
that difeaie is become lei's fatal. 

Agriculture^ Sheep, tafc. — Agriculture was in a very imper- 
itdi ftate previous to i 762. Potatoes of a proper kind, and 
the planting of them with the plough m drill rows, was in- 
troduced after this period, as well as the culiivation of clover 
and rye-grafs. Lime and manure were unknown, except on 
a few acres of what is called croft-land, which was nsver out 
of crop. Every farm, except grafs ones, of between L 30 
and L. 40 of yearly rent, may be ftated as raifing 2 acres of 
wheat, 4 of barley, about 14 or 15 of oats, and 2 of potatoes. 
Rye is not much cultivated here, as it is thought to be a 
robbing crop. The raifing of turnip is found to be beneficial, 
^nd has increafed greatly within thefe two years. The far- 



i Bz Statl/lical Accouni 

mers are alfo beginning to raife cabbage. Thej^ generally 
lay out their wheat and barley fields with clover and rye- 
grafs, which produce excellent crops. They in general be- 
gin to low oats about the loth of March, barley in the end 
of April or beginning of May, and wheat In the month of 
Oflober. They reap their wheat and barley about the mid- 
dle of Augufl: ; the oat crop immediately fucceeds ; and in 
good years the harveft is concluded in the fouthern part of 
the parifh before the end of September, The average rent 
of the beft arable land, except three farms, is from 15 s. to 
L. 1:3 :o per acre; meadow i 1. is.; pafturage, not in 
tillage, though arable, 3 s. and 4 s. ; inferior arable from 5 s. 
to 10 s. The average fize of farms, excluding the three large 
ones already mentioned, is about 100 acres. There are few 
inclofures in the parilh, but the people are very much con- 
vinced of their Xitility. Since the commencement of the new 
leafes, land, formerly uncultivated, has been greatly impro- 
ved. The parifh not only fupplies itfelf with provifions, bat 
annually exports confiderable quantities of wheat, barley, 
oats, oatmeal, and potatoes, of the bell kind. The farmers, 
in general, have a very fine breed of cattle, rather above the 
middle fize. Tinwald parks and fhaws, confifting of about 
1500 acres, are remarkable for producing the beft fat cattle 
and flisep in this part of the country. Ihere are about 66 
or 70 fcore of flieep in the parifli. Of late, an attempt has 
been made to improve the breed, for the fake of the wool, 
part of which is now fold at 14 or 15 lliillings per ftone, 
though, formerly, 7 or 8 fhillings was the common price. A 
few of ths fcpanifh Iheep have been procured, and fome of 
the .Shetland kind are wanted. The excellent palture here 
has hitlierto been found to impr^jve greatly every kind that 
has been put upon it. Should the Ipirit of improving the 
wool become general, it would be a fource of immenfe wealth

Populatlcn — The inhabitants were more numerous many 
years ago, by fome hundreds, than at prefent j ten or more 
tenants fometimes being turned out with their cotta^-'^rs to 
make way for one. In fome inftances, only the herdlinan is 
retained in the farm. By the ftate of the population given 
to Dr "Webfter, the number was 795. The inhabitants at 
prefent amount to 850. The population is increafcd about 
20 fince 1 785.

Poor. — The number of the poor in this parifli varies frotw 
14 to 20. They are maintained by the weekly contribution, 
which is about L. 15 per annum^ and from a fund of L. 140, 
mortified by feveral individuals for that purpofe. There is 
no inftance of any of them going out of the parifh ; and they 
are leldom troublefome to the inhabitants. 

Price of Labour and Provlfiom, — ^^Fhe ordinary wages for la- 
bourers in hufbandry is 1 s. without, or 8 d. with vidtuals. 
A married man prefers the Ihilling. Their families are ge- 
nerally fupported dececently. None of them are known to 
be in want, or even to receive charity. Carpenters, brick- 
layers, and mafons, have from is. 6 d. to is. 10 d. without 
vifliials; taylors 8d. with vidiuals ; male iervants from L. 6 : la 
to L. 10 nnd niore per annum ; maid fervants from L. 2:10 
to L. 4. The prefent price of beef is from 3 s. 6 d. to 5 s. 6 d. 
per ftone ; veal is between 3 d. and 4 d. per lb. ; mutton 
froui 3 d. to 5 d. ; lamb about 3 d ; pork 3 d. and 4 d. The 
price of a d.ick is from 8 d. to i s. ; of a goofe is. 10 d. ; 
chi( kens are 7 d. and 8 d. per pair ; butter from 7 d. to 1 1 d. 
per lb ; common cheefe from 3d. to 4 d. The Carlifle 
bufhel, or 3 'Winchefter bufliels of wheat, fells from i6s. to 
L. 1:1:0; barley from 2 s. to 3 s. per Winchefter bufliel, 
and fomeiimes more \ oats from 2 s. to 2 s. 6 d. and often 
more ; oat-meal from x s. to 2 s. 4 d. per ftone. The price 
of labour and provifions is nearly doubled within theie lafi: 
30 years. 

Church and Stipend. — The church of Tinwald was rebuilt 
in 1763. The manfe was built in 1720, but has been feveral 
times repaired. New offices with flate roofs were built zhoxit 
12 years ago-, and the whole repaired in 1790. The ftipend 
is L. 77 :4 :o. Ihe glebe conlifts of 15 acres, and, taken 

along 



of Ti'nwald* 



along with the manfe and offices, may be rated at between 
L- 15 and L. 29. The King is patron of the old parifli of 
Trailflat, and the Duke of Queenfberry of Tinwald. 

Antiquiiies. — A branch of the Roman road from Brunf- 
wark runs through the pariflies of Dryfdale and Lochmaben, 
enters the old parifli of Trailflat, and pafles by Amisfield 
houfe, where there are very diftin£t traces of an ancient caf- 
tdlum This road terminates in the parifli of Kirkaiahoe, at 
the fmall village of Dunfcore. There are alfo very diftincl 
traces of a Britifli fort on the top of Barfell Hifl, about a mile 
from the church. 

Eminetit Men. — The famous Paterfon, who, it is faid, plan- 
ned the Danen fcheme, the Bank of England, &amp;c. was born 
at Skipmyre, a farm in the old parifli of Trailflat, about the 
year 1 660. He does not feem to have been an obfcurs Scotch- 
man, as a certain writer ftiles him ; he more than once re- 
prefented Dumfries, &amp;c. in the Scotch parliament. The 
fame houfe gave birth to his grandnephew, Dr James Moun- 
fey, firfl phyfician for many years to the Emprefs of Ruflia. 
The widow, who now enjoys the farm, is After to Dr John 
Rodgeribn, who fucceeded Dr Mounfey as firfl: phyfician to 
the Emprefs. 

Mtfcellaneoiis Ohfervatlons. — With regard to the advantages 
of this parifh, it may be obferved, that a fpring of fine water 
may be found in almoft every field. It is interfefted in va- 
rious places by fine rivulets. It is near the market town of 
Dumfries. The turnpike road to Edinburgh pafl'es through 
it, on which a mail coach runs once a day, and a diligence 
often three times a week. Other roads in the parifli are 
very bad : There is, however, fufiicienfiy of money for re- 
pairs.

pairs. The ftatute labour is commuted. The general opi- 
nion is much in favour of turnpikes. One of the moft ex- 
tcnfive blcachfields in Scotland is carried on at Trailflat. 
There are only 3 fmall villages. There is one lake of about 
5 or 6 acres in extent. It is faid that a fet of farm houfes 
once flood on the fpot which this lake now occupies, and that 
they were funk by an earthquake. Almoil every farmer has 
two carts. Two horfes will draw, in hght fingle carts, 16 
creels of coal from Sanquhar with greater eafe than 10 creels 
in a heavy double cart In 1782, the parifh not only fup- 
plied itfelf, but exported grain in confiderable quantities* 
Property in land has been frequently changing ; but fomc 
farms have been rented by the fame family for the fpace of 
300 years. About nine years ago the parifh abounded with 
wood ; but only a few trees now remam. The woods on 
one eftate fold for L. 6000 The people, with a few excep- 
tions, are induftrious and fober. They enjoy many of the 
comforts of fociety : Their houles, however, are in general 
miferable hovels. Till within thefe two or three years, up- 
wards of 500 bufliels of malt were made in the parifh by 
different tenants for their own ufe, and to fupply labourers 
at a reafonable rate, the excife of which, though moderate, 
amounted to a confiderable fum ; but they are now almofl 
totally deprived of this comfort, owing chiefly to the feverity 
of the excife laws, and are in danger of being driven to the 
drani-/Jjop, which is at once pernicious to their health and de- 
flrudlive of their morals.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5188731">CROSS MICHAEL</name>. 

By the Rev. Mr John Johnstone.</head> 

<p>

Origin of the Name. 

IN old writings, the name of this pariOi is Corfemlchael ; 
but of late the orthography in the title has been more in 
ure. The etymology is obvioufly Saint Michael's Crofs. 

Situation, Extent, anil Surface. — This pariOi lies near the 
center of the ftewartry of Kirkcudbright, in the prefbyterv 
of Kirkcudbright, and fynod of Galloway. It is nearly of a 
reiTtangular form. Its length, from north to fouth, is about 
5 Englifh miles ; and its breadth, from caft to weft, from 3 to 
4. Ic is bounded on the north by Parton ; on the eaft by the 
river or water of Urr, which leparates it from Kirkpatrick- 
Durham and Urr ; on the fouth by Puittle and Kelton ; 
and on the weft by the Dee, which feparatei i.t from Balma- 
ghie. About a fixth part of this parifta, contiguous to its 
northern border, is moftly covered with heath and coarfs 
grafs, and contains a few hills of moderate elevation, which 
in general are rocky. A great part of the farcns in this neigh- 
bourhood is capable of improvement, and is daily receiving 
it : The reft oc the parifli prefents a furface very beautifully 
diverfified. The land rifes in the form of a ridge from the 
two rivers, and is, at regular diftances, intcrfperfcd with gen- 
tle 



Stat'l/lkal Account 



tie fwells, or, as they are called, knows, all of which are arable, 
and, when properly drefled, have a fine efFeft. Along the 
Dee is an extenfive and fertile valley. 

Soil, Climate^ isfc. — The foil is extremely various ; fuch as 
loam, meadow, holm, till, gravellifh or fandy. The whole is 
remarkable for producing exuberant crops of grain, and a 
Ipecies of natural grafs, which, though not tall, is excellent 
pafturage. A good deal of rain falls in moll: parts of the weft 
of Scotland. There is, however, rather lefs here than in the 
adjacent parifhes, becaufe the high hills which colleft the 
vapours, and break the clouds, are at a confiderable diftance. 
The air is by no means moift : Snow fddon:i lies long ; and, 
on the whole, this place is as healthy as any in Britain. Sines 
the moffes have been drained, the ague, which was the only 
prevalent diftemper, has quite difappeared. The two rivers 
which bound its eaftern and weilern extremities, promote a 
conftant circulation of air, and prevent noxious vapours from 
colle£ting. The people live not in towns or villagee, and 
moft of them are employed in agriculture, which is flivou- 
rable at once to health, longevity, and morals. Within thefe 
20 years, at leaft 1 2 perfons have died in the lower parts of Gal- 
loway, from 100 to 115 years old. William Marflial, a tinker 
in this place, is now 118. He might pafs for a man of 60. 
His faculties are unimpaired, and he walks through the coun- 
try with eafe. One thing muft here be dated as highly per- 
nicious. The advanced duties oa malt have almoft entirely 
abolilhed the practice of brewing. Ale-houfes no longer ex- 
ift; but dram-faoufes have been fubftituted in their place, 
which thi v;heapnefs of whifky, and the contraband trade in 
foreign fpirits carried on in this country, tempt the people 
to frequent too much. 



c/ Crofsmlchael. 169 

Z,ahs, Rivers^ and Canals. — There are two lakes or lochs 
.to be taken notice of. Erngrogo Loch is remarkable for two 
imall iflands on it, which are breeding places for fea-gulls, 
that repair thither in great quantities at the proper feafon. 
Loch Rohn, or Roan, fomewhat larger than the torn:er, is a 
very great natural curiofity. Its Ibperficial contents are from 
3'6 to 40 acres, and its depth Is from 10 to 22 fathoms. It 
is fituated in the higheft part of the adjacent country. No 
rivulets or ftreams run into ir, nor -has it any vifible fupply 
except the clouds. Its waters are exceedingly clear, and, 
unlels the froft be very intenfe, it fo-ldom freezes. At the 
mouth of the Urr there is a fmall harbour, at which Fnglidi 
lime and coals are imported, and grain and meal exported. 
The Dee is formed by the junflion of the Dee and the Ken, 
two miles and a half above tiie head of this parifn, v.'hence 
tliey proceed in their courfe under the name of the Dee, till 
they fail hnto the lea below Kirkcudbright. The breadth of 
llie Dee, oppofite to this parifli, is from 700 to 2220 feet. 
There are feveral fords when the water is low ; but all of 
them are dangerous, and have been fatal to fcwral perfons, 
as the pools are not fecn on account of the blacknels of the 
xvater. There are two femes here : One is called the Boat 
of Balmaghie; and about a mile above Is the Boat of Living- 
lion. The water here is 45 feet deep-, and this is the place 
at which the canal, to be afterv/ards mentioned, would join 
the Dee. The meadows along the Dee, which arc very ex- 
teufive, rcvtr fail to be hid tinder water after a heavy fall of 
r.v.n. During the winter, the floods are fo frequent, and leave 
f (juantlties of fand, that the meadows are rendered unfit 
for pallurage. In fome places, earthen banks or mounds 
have been erefted, are creeling, or may be erefted with ad« 
vantage ; but by far the greater part of the meauo vvs cannot 
poflTbly be favcd from the inundations. Some years ago, Mr 

Vol. I. Y Gordon 



170 Statijlical Account 

Gordon of Culvennan, at his own expence, cut a canal to 
conneft the Dee with Carlinwark Loch. Thus, boats carry- 
ing from 10 to 24 cart load of marie each, pafled up to New 
Galloway, fituatcd 15 miles from the loch, Marie fold at 
the loch at i s. per cart load , or 21 cubical feet was lold at 
New Galloway at is. pd. ; and proportionally lower at other 
places by the way The canal is only on a fmall fcale, and 
at prefent out of repair. The rocks at Tongland bridge, and 
3ts Ihallownefs between them and this place, prevent the Dee 
from being navigable for 8 or 10 miles, it might, however, 
be connefted with the fea at two places by a canal, by whidi 
veffeis might carry up the means of improvement to a coun- 
try that wants them, and return with fuel to one in which 
the want of this neceiTai y article prevents the introduction of 
rnaiiufaftures. An acual iurvey has lately been made; and, 
from the cltimates of flcillful engineers, it appears that the 
wifhed for communicat on might be opened for L. 9000. A 
curious fadt has been alcertaiued by Mr Copland, viz. that 
the rivers in this neighbourhood have confiderably decreafed. 
of lati, and that the Urr did not difcharge into the lea a 
third part of the water it did 40 years ago. Mr Copland thus 
accounts for this ftriking phenomenon. Land uncultivated, 
and covered with neath, is almoft impenetrable by water ; 
and, of courle, the rain that falls muft run off its furface into 
the channels of the rivers. This was the ftate of the hind 
here till it began to be ia/proved by marie and lime. The 
application of thefe matiures pulverifes the ground, and 
prepares it for ablbrbing the rain. Befides, as it is well known 
that water is a material part of the food of plants, lefs of it 
will be left to flow into a river, when at lead "• four blades of 
" grafs, and four ears of corn, have been made to grow on 
C6 its banksj where there was only one before."

Ft/h. — The Urr abounds with trouts, and a great many 
lahrjon come to fpawn in it ; but few are taken or fold here. 
There is a great falmon fifhcry on the Dee at Kirkcudbright, 
and another at Tongland, about two mile s above it. The fal- 
hion of the Dee are of a darker colour, and much fatter, than 
thofe of molt other rivers in the fouth of .Scotland, l ew of 
them get over the deep rocks at Tongland excspt when the 
water is ivvelled, and thole that do are obliged to make the bell 
of their way pall; the ioch or Ken, as its inhabitants are not re- 
markable for hofpitality : Thefe are, the pike or ged, the perch, 
and the eel. The pike are found here in great perfedtion, anil 
bf an uncommon fize . They are always in lealon when the wea- 
ther permits them to be caught. Tiiey are caught with the 
fly, or with lines baited with burn trouts or frogs. The perch 
were firfl introduced into this river and loch in the year 
1750, by the late Alexander Copland, Efq; of Colliefton. 
Since that time they have niultiphed remarkably, and are 
now taken in great quantities, elpecially about midfummcr, 
by thofe who filh with worm baits for amufement. The eels 
are never interrupted in then- pollcflion of the waters, as the 
country people have an infuperablc prejudice agaiuft feeding 
on an animal which fo llrongly refembles the ferpent. The 
cale, however, was different in former times. In the dark 
ages, when the art of cookery was but little underftood, there 
was, in this parilh, a filhery of eels, which were exported to 
Italy. This is mentioned by Hedtor Boethius, and after hinx 
by Buchanan. 

Population. — As records have not been regularly kept, the 
antlent ftate of popuiatio 1 here cannot be preciieV afcertain- 
ed. The knowledge of fome fadts hath however been pre- 
ferved. From the year 1751 to 1761 the baptifms were 128, 
being, on au average, about 13 yearly. For the 16 following

cording to the return made to Dr Webiler about 40 years 
ago, this parifli contained 613 fouls. On an adtual enumera- 
tion, it was found, on the ift January 1791, to contain 772^

Of thofe who have died in the courfe of thefe feven years, 
12 were under 4 years of age; 9 from 60 to 70; 16 frora 
70 to 85 ; and 23 of various ages. The annual births have 
been to the whole population as 1 to 36 ; tlie marriages as 
1 to 192 ; the deaths as i to 98. This lall circumftance af- 
fords a firiking proof of the uncommon hcahhinefs of the 
place. 

Caiifes "which have nffecled the State of Pcpuhiliorh — Formerly 
ihere were a conliderable number of lot-crofts^ that is, ftaali 
pieces of land kept always in crop, and let along with cotta- 
ges, and the privilege of grafs for one or two cows. The 
abolition oi thefe about 20 or 30 years ago, and the pratSlice 
of throwing feveral farms into one, occupied chiefly for the 
purpofe of gra2ing, gave a temporary check to popul.ition. 
A very large tra(St of the finert: land in this parifh was for a 
number of years in the pofleflion of one man, who neither 
j-cfided upon, nor ploughed it. Of late, marie and lime 
have contributed greatly to the improvement of the country ; 
and, as agricuhure requires more hands than paflurage, po- 
pulatioil has been increafing with rapidity. The farms have 
been reduced to a fmaller fizc ; and or.iy three are occupied 
by tenants who do not rellde upon them. In a few years a 
confiderable number will probably be .idded to the people, 
by the execution of a plan adopted, on part of their eftates, 
by ihree gentlemen, to whom a large portion of the parifli 
belongs. The plan is this : As foon as a leafe expires (and 
feveral hundred acres now are, or have lately been in the na- 
turiil pofleflion of the proprietors) the farm is parcelled out 
iiito linall lots, from 4 to 15 acres each of arable ground. 
Thefe, properly fenced, are let to thofe who offer the high- 
eft rent. The tenants fue houfe-fteads and gardens, for which 
they pay a duty, at the rate of L. 2 or L. 4 per acre annually, 

and

and on which they build at their own expence what hoiifes; 
they need. Of the adjoining park they get a 19 years leafe, 
at about double the rent which was paid by farmers, properly 
fo called. Several of thefe lots are taken, to be entered on 
now, or at Whitfunday next. The tenants are either tradef- 
men or labourers, who propofe to confume in their families 
the produce of the land, and to pay the rent out of the money 
they receive for working for others.

Chara^ltr of the People. — In their religious fentiments, the 
inhabitants of Galloway are apparently more united than 
thole ot moft other parts of Scotland. Within the bounds 
of the extenfive prefbytery of Kirkcudbright, there is not a 
dilTcnting meeting-houfe of any deicription. The morals of 
the people in this country have, from three caulcs, fullamed 
material injury. Its vicinity to Ireland has rendered it the 
receptacle of fome of the leaft refpeftable of the inhabitants 
of that kingdom. The cattle trade is lefs favourable than 
agriculture to fobriety and honefty : But, above all, fmug- 
gling, for which our local fituation is but too favourable, tends 
to relax every moral obligation. But, while thele general re- 
marks are made, it is by no means admitted that the conduft 
of the inhabitants of this parifii furnifl\es any extraordinary 
evidence of their truth. None have occafion to btg without 
^he bounds of the parifli. Vagrants never repeat without 
efFedt a real or a fiditious tale of woe ; and when extraordi- 
nary coUecftions are made for any charitable purpofe, this pa- 
rifli yields not to auy of its neighbours in point of liberality. 
The llile of manners are fuch as may be expelled to charac- 
terife a people in a ftate between rudenels and refinement, 
pofliffed of a competent portion of the comforts of life, with- 
out having obtained the means ol luxury. 

Church, yc. — The manfe was built in 1744, and the 
church in 1751. Both have been repaired and enlarged fince 
the ordination of the prefent incumbent. Ten acres have 
been added to 5I, of which the glebe formerly confifted. By 
decreet 1784, the ftipendsare,42bolls vidlual, and L.762:i6:io 
Scots money. The value of the whole living, on an average, 
may be L. 112 Sterling. Alexander Gordon of Culvennan, 
Efq; IS patron. Mr John Johnftone, a batchellor, is the pre- 
fent incumbent.

Schools. — In the year 1 735, William Gordon, Efq; merchant 
in Briftol, built a fchool and fchooltnafter's houl'e, and endowed 
it with 3 falary of L. per annum^ on condition tim all the 
children of the pariili ftiould be taught gratis. As the ex- 
pence of living advanced, the fchooln-.after found this provi- 
fion too fmall for his fupport. In the year 1775, he prefent- 
ed a petition to the commiflioners of fupply, and obtained a 
legal falary of 200 merks .Scots. His living, therefore, in- 
cluding gratuities at Candlemas, may amount to L. 23 on an 
average. The houies formerly built having become ruinous, 
new ones were crefted in the year 1787, in a more centrical 
fituation, and the expence of them was defrayed out of the 
vacant ftipends, which fell due during the dependence of a 
law-fuit, about the right of patronage, previous to the fettle- 
ment of the prefent nunifler. At this Ichool about 60 chil- 
dren are inftrufted in Latin, Englifh, writing, arithmetic, &amp;c. 
There are feveral private teachers, whom a few neighbouring 
families employ and pay. 

Poor. — On an averag?, feven or eight perfo.ns are maln- 
t".ined by alms. At prefent, two are fupported out of the 
parochial funds. Five, who can earn part of their fubfiftencC;, 
receive a fmall quarterly contribution and three others are 
occauonally relieved as their neceffities require. The funds 
arife entirely from the voluntary offerings of the people. The 
coUedlions in the church are about L. \g per annum. The 
principal heritor makes up the lofs, which the poor would 
otherwife fuftain from his non-refidence, by ordering a con- 
{Iderablc quantity of meal to be diHributed among them an- 
nually, according to the direflion of the feffion, and by fur- 
nifhing conftant employment in his gardens and policy to fe- 
veral old and blind n-icn, at the rate of 6 d. per day, which 
prevents them from becoming public burdens.

Whe Prices of Provlfms and Labour, and the Etcpeiices of a 
Labourer's Family, — Differ fo little here from thofe in the pa- 
rifh of Holywood, that the reader may be fafely referred to 
the account given in pages 26, 27, and 28, of this volume. 
It muft, however, be obferved, that the price of lome articles, 
though nominally the fame in both places, is really lower 
here ; for the Kirkcudbright pound of cheefe, butter, &amp;c. 
confifting of 28 ounces, is 4 ounces heavier than that of Dum- 
fries. Meal is for the moft part i d. per ftone cheaper here 
than it is there. A great part of the harveft work is per- 
formed by perfons from the moors, who hire for the whole 
harveft, which includes reaping, putting in the crop, and 
thatching the ftacks. Their wages are from L. i : i : o to 
L. 1:6:0. They fleep and are maintained in the farmers 
houfes, whether the weather permits them to work or not. 

• Divi/Ian, Rem, and Price of Land. — In the year 1771,3 very 
accurate map of this parifti was drawn by INIr William M'Cart- 
uey land furveyor ; but, as this map was never engraven, on- 
ly two copies are extant. The number, fize, and rents of the

The proprietors of thefe nine refide upon them. 



The moor grounds are let, on an average, at 2s. or 2s. 6d. 
per acrei arab}e and pafturc, of inferior quality, from 6s. to 
|2s.; the beft arable, pafture, and meadow, from L. i to 
Jj. 1 : 19 : o. The importance of indofures is acknowledged, 
and the number of them is daily increa(ing. A great many 
farms have been fold, fince the laft peace, at the rate of from 
23 to 28 years purchafe. 

Implements' and Operations of Hujbandry.—^htre are 8© 
ploughs, 120 carts, and 218 horles, all of which, except a few 
young horfes, are employed in the improvement and cultiva- 
tion of land. This is a country in a middle ftate between 
pafturage and agriculture. Of late years, calcareous manures, 
both foreign and indigcnqus, have been much ufed, and leafes 
have been granted' on terms calculated to encourage the pur- 
chafe apd application of them. The tenants have it in their 
power to plough annually a fourth, and fome a third part of 
their arable ground, provided they can carry on their plough- 
ing 



of Crofsmichaeh 



ing in a regular cotirfe, always opening tL' oldefl: ground 
firft, and taking only three, or, if one of them be green, 
four fucceffive crops from the fame field, and allowing 
it afterwards to reft at leaft fix years. Except potatoes, few 
green crops are railed here, chiefly owing to the want of pro- 
per fences for preferving turnips or cabbages from the cat- 
tle during winter ; and alfo becaufe the practice of hou- 
fing cattle has not yet become general, and, of courfe, 
iuch quantities of dung as thefe crops would require are not 
collected. Not above lo or 12 acres of wheat ..re iown an- 
nually; thofe fown with barley may exceed 100. About a 
third part of the lanus, as it goes out, is fown down with rye 
grafs and clover feeds ; and, if it has not been previoufly im- 
poverifhed by over-cropping, the hay produced, both in point 
of quantity and quality, is highly valuable. The ftaple grain 
is oats. I'he fmall or grey oats have almoft entirely given 
place to the white oats, though they are ftill lefs pure, and of 
an inferior quality to thofe raifed in countries where improve- 
ments have been longer introduced. Of late, fome farmers 
have cultivated a fpecies of black oats, which are fooner 
ripe, and yield more meal, than any hitherto tried. In ge- 
neral, oats raifed from ground improved with marie yield lefs 
meal than thofe from ground improved with lime, becaufe 
Uie fhell or hull of the former oats is thicl er. The marie, 
however, is found to be the beft manure for grafs, and to be 
peculiarly adapted to the foil of Gallov/ay. The farmers lay 
their account with paying one term's rent out of the profits 
of their crop, and the other out of thofe of their cattle. Moft 
of the marie difcovered in this parifli has been exhaufted. 
The principal refource now is the loch of Carlinwark, in the 
parifti of Kelton, which abundantly fupplies the demands of 
the country. This loch was fold three years ago for L. 2000. 

Produc- 



l8o Staiiftical Account 

Produniotis. — About 80 acres are planted with trees, all of 
\yhich are in a thriving condition. Grafs is raifed for the 
21 8 horfes mentioned above, and for 4 afTes, 25 goats, 600 
flieep, and 1840 black cattle. The breeding fyftem is in ge« 
neral purfued. The higheft recommendation, of a cow is, 
that fhe brings up a good beaft, and not, as elfewhere, that 
Ihe gives much milk; and it has even become a proverb, that 
*« a good farmer would rather kill his old fon than kill a 

calf." The Galloway cattle have one charafteriftic which 
naturalifts may think incredible ; they are almoft all without 
horns ! Dr Samuel Johnfon, in his journey to the Weftcrn 
Iflands, (London edition, 1775, pag. 186), has the following 
notabie paflagc : " Of their black cattle, fome are without 
«« horns, called by the Scots humble cows, as we call a bee a 
«' humble bee that wants a fling. Whether this difference 
*' be fpecific or accidental, though we inquired uuiih great di- 
«« hgsnce^ we could not be informed. We are not very furc 
«« that the bull is ever without horns, though we have been 
* told that fuch bulls there are. What is produced by put- 
«' ting a horned and an unhorned male and female together, 
" no man has ever tried, who thought the refidt worthy of 
*• obfervation." Though it may favour of arrogance, the 
high authority quoted muft be flatly contradidted. There is 
not within the bounds of this parifh a fingle bull, nor a male 
of any other fpecies, except a few goats and rams, with horns. 
The experiment the philofopher wifiied for, has been tried a 
thoufand times, and the refult has been obferved to be a 
calfy fometimes with, and fometimes without horns, but nc" 
ver, as the Do£tor nioft probably expelled, an unicorn. A fe# 
cattle are fatted here for home confumntlon, and for the 
Dumfries market ; but the far greater part of thofe reared 
are difpofed of, at 3 and 4 years of age, to the drovers, who 
carry them up to London, but chiefly to Norfolk and Suffolk. 

Some 



9f Crofsmkhaei. 18 1 

Some drovers turn from L. 30,006 to L. 35,000 per annum. 
With refpedt to other provifions, this parifh does more than 
. fupply itfelf. At Dumfries there is a ready market for fat 
fwine, which are bought up and tured for the ufe of the 
Engllfli. Some barley, and a very great quantity of oats and 
bat-meal, are annually fent by land carriage to New (Jalloway 
and Damellington, to fupply the moor country ; and ftill 
greater quantities are fhipped at the foot of the Urr and the 
Dee, for Liverpool, Whithaven, and the manufatfturing towns 
in Lanark and Renfrewfhire. Hares and partridges abound 
here, and they are even increaflng, although none of our he- 
ritors are fo attached to the game laws as to make an annual 
publication, in the newfpapers, of their determined purpofe 
to become the avengers of blood on the iniquitots generation 
Of poachers. 

Roads. — About a mile of the great military road (made by 
government) from the Englilh border to Portpatrick, pafles 
through the fouth end of this parifh. Some years ago, the 
ftatute labour was converted by a£l of parliament. The in- 
habitants of this diftri£t pay at prefent the maximum, which 
is 15 s. Sterling for each L. 100 Scots valuation. SSveral 
good lines of road have been fixed on, and lome of them are 
about half made. There is ftill much room for improve- 
ment. There are no turnpikes in this, or in the neighbour- 
ing county of Wigton. Turnpike roads would be very ac- 
ceptable, if the ceremony of coIle£l;ing money at the toll-bars 
could be difpenfed with. It is doubted how far they would 
be expedient on any other terms. If they fiiall take place, 
manures ought to be exempted, and a very moderate tax 
Ihould be laid on cattle, where the trade in them is carried 
on to fo great an extent. 

Antiquities, 



^tatiflkal Accouni 



Antiquities, — ^There are in this parifh ten irregular heaps of 
' loofe ftonss, which antiquaries called PlEllJI} cairns. Three 
of thefe have been opened by perfons ftill alive ; and in each 
of them fome human bones have been found, in cofHns 
confiderably above the ordinary fize. There are feveral 
moats, as in other parts of Scotland ; remains of anticnt and 
later fortifications. The foundations of a very large convent 
was lately difcovered, about which record and tradition are 
filent. Farmers in ploughing, and labourers in digging, have 
frequently found Roman urns, fwords, and other imple- 
mentsi 

Languagey and Eiymolcgy of Names of Places.— The language 
fpoken here is neither Englifh nor Scottilh, but a mixture 
of both. With the exception of a few provincial words and 
phrafes, the inhabitants fye^k with more propriety than thofe 
of the fame ftation in moft parts of Scotland. The names of 
places are derived from the Englifh, the Gaelic, and from 
combinations of both. Many of them are defcriptive of the 
lituations of places, or of their dependence ofi the church, &amp;c. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The advantages of this 
jdace, as muft appear from what hath been faid, are very con- 
fiderable. The chief difadvantages which it labours under, 
are the fcarcity and dearnefs of fuel, and the length and bad- 
nels of the roads over which it muft be brought. The plough 
has almoft totally removed the whins, and other brulh-wood^ 
which formerly were of material fervice to the poor. As there 
are few moffes in the parilh, mod: of the peats muft be brought 
from the dillance of 4 or 5 miles; and even there the proprie- 
tors wiU fcarccly difpofe of them at any price. Some people 
bri?it^ cOals, by land carriage, 40 miles from Damellington iii

3re water-borne, and exadted by the revenue officers with 
great rigour. Scarcely any grievance calls more loudly 
for redrefs. If a duty muft be had from coals, it would 
certainly be more confiftent with the wifdom of parliament 
to lay it on at the pit, than to collefl it folely from tho(e whofe 
local fituation fubjecSts them to the additional expences ot 
freight and infurance.

Name, Situation, Extent, Soi/, and Surface. 

THE name of this parifli, for more than 300 years paft, 
has been fpelt Parton ; and Parton, though probably 
altered, both in orthography and pronunciation, from the 
Gaelic, whence it is derived, i;? faid to fignify in that language 
the hill top, which is perfefHy defcriptive of the fituation. 
Moft of the names of places here are derived from the Gaelic, 
and, under all the difguifes of writmg and pronunciation, are 
ftill underftood and interpreted by thofe who are Ikilled in 
that language. This parifti lies in the ftewartry and prefby- 
tery of Kirkcudbright, and fynod of Galloway, It approach- 
es to a fquare form, 5 miles on each fide. It is bounded on 
the north by Balmaclellan ; on the eaft by Kirkpatrick-Dur- 
ham, fronn which it is leparated by the fmall river Urr ; on 
the fouth-eaft by Crofsmichael ; on the fouth by Balmaghie, 
from which it is feparatcd by ^he Dee ; on the weft and fouth- 
weft by Kelis, from which it is feparated by the Ken, a river 
that is in fon.e places near a mile broad. The parifti is from 10 
to 15 miles from the neareft fea-port ; and no roads are open- 
ed up to its interior parts. The arable ground is of a light 
or fandy quality. The ground is very unequal. There are 

no 



of Pay 185* 

\Si tonfiderable mountains, but many little hills. The flats 
and eminencies are generally covered with heath, except in 
the fouthern border, where furze and broom ufed to prevail 
before the improved mode of cultivation. 

Agriculture, l^c. — ^The number of farms is between 40 and 
50. Each hath a plough. The old ScottHh plough is ufed 
in breaking up the ground, when 3, and often 4, horfcs 
are ufed a-breart. In the fubfequent ploughings a lighter 
plough, with 2 horfes and i man, is uled. It is fuppolcd 
that 400 acres may be annually employed in raifing oats, 6 
or 8 in barley, and 50 in potatoes. Potatoes make a prmci- 
pal article of food of the lower clafles of the people ; and, 
with a fmall degree of attention, the old crop continues good 
till fucceeded by the new. On the lale and exporr.itioa of 
llieep, wool, black cattle and oats, the farmers depend f.^r the 
paying of their rents. Oats are fown from the middle to the 
end of March, and reaped from the end ot Augult to the end 
of September. Potatoes are planted in the beginning of April, 
and are ready at Lammas. Moft part of the farms are inclo- 
fed with i'lone dykes. The advantages of fuch inclolures are 
well known. The land rent of the parilh is near L. 2000. 
Land fells from 27 to 32 years purchafe. The nature of the 
ground in different farms is very different. One, confifting 
of 45 acres, lately let at L. 48 per annum ; another, of more 
than 400 acres, let "for L. 40. The rent of farms is from 
L. 10 to L. 120 per annum. Although the rents of foine 
farms have been even doubled within thefe laft 30 years, yec 
the condition of the people is much improved. * 

Atr and Dijlempers. — The air is falubrious, and there are 
no epidemic diftempers, if we except rheumatic complaints, 
which, for thefe laft 40 years, have prevailed among all ranks.

Mineral Springs^ Lakes, and Rivers. — There is a minera! 
fpring, which is luppoleJ to poliefs, in fome degree, the qua- 
lities of the old well at MoflFat It was formerly much fre- 
quented by the common people, but is now quite negkfted. 
lio cures have been projjerly authenticated. Perhaps the 
water was uled m an injudicious manner. There are feven 
fmall lakes plentifully llorcd with trout. The river Dee joins 
the Ken about half a mile above the kirk, from whence it 
has the name Dee till it enters the Solvvay Frith at Kirkcud- 
bright. In a flood, the Dee fometimes rifes 8 feet perpen- 
dicularly, by which large trafls of meadow ground are over- 
flowed. This, in fummer, is very hurtful to the hay; but, 
in winter and fpring, confiderably improves the crop. Op- 
pofite to '^arton, the river is from loo yards to half a mile 
broad, and from lo to 30 feet deep. It abounds in pike and 
perch. The former are caught from 3 to 40 lb. ; the latter 
from I to 4 or 5. , Formerly the moor^ afforded great plen- 
ty of bl.ick and red game ; hares and partridges are ftill in 
abundance woodcocks appear in the end of Offiober. 

^larries. — A flate quarry, not a mile from the river, was 
formerly wrought, but by unlkillful management has gooe 
into difrepote. In the opinion of judges, it might ftlil be 
rendered valuable, confidering the fpirit of improvement, 
efpecially of building, which feems to prevail much in this 
part of the country.

Poor. — At an average for 20 years paft, the number of 
poor who have received ftated or occafional fupplies are 6. 
The annual collc£bions» and the intereft of lent money, 
amount to L. \o per annum. In 1782 — 3, though the meal 
got up to half-a-crown the ftone, yet the poor were compe- 
tently fupplied, and the other inhabitants lived much in their 
ufual ftile. 

Price of Labour and Prov'ijions. — In 1 761, the yearly wages 
of a man fervant were L. 2 : ! 0, of a maid fervant L. i : i o. 
In 1790, the former have advanced to L. 8, or L. 8 : 10, and 
the latter from L. 3 to L. 4 per annum, A labourer's wages are 
8 d. and his vidtuals ; a mafon's or carpenter's i s. j a taylor's 
8d. There is no ftated market here for provifions. In 1761, 
a fat flicep, weighmg from 40 to 50 lbs. fold for 7s. or 7s. 6d. ; 
a dozen of eggs for id.; a hen for 4 d. ; a pound of butter 
for 6 d. ; a ftone of cheefe for 3 s. ; and a ftone of oat meal 
for ) s. Now, all thefe articles, except the hft, are nearly 
doaDled. 

Fuely Is'c. — Peat is the general fuel. It is fcarce in the 
fouthern parts ; and the poorer fort of peoj.le ufe broom and 
furze. It is plentiful in the middle and eaftern parts, and of 
the beft quality. The moffes are of difficult accefs, as no pro- 
per roads are opened. The inhabitants are obliged to carry 
hoine their peat on horfe-back in corn lacks, as carts can- 
not be u(ed. There are no turnpike roads in this part of 
Galloway. The principal road here, which goes along the 
river, will be made good by a commutation of the ftatute la- 
bour, at the rate of 15 s. the L. 100 valued rent, which an- 
nually produces L. 22 Sterling. 

Jniiquiiies,—Jsczv the church there is an artificial mount,

i 20 yards circumference at the bafe, which is circular. It is 
furrounded with a ditch from 6 to 9 feet deep, whence the 
earth which compofes the mount appears to have been taken. 
About half a mile north there is another mount, nearly double 
the dimenfions of the former, inclofcd with two ditches. On 
a gentle eminence, at 200 yards diftance,- is feen the remains 
of a fmall Druidical circle. About 3 miles north from the 
church there is a remarkable heap of ftones, from which the 
farm where it lies feems to have been named the Cairn. The 
circular bafe is 120 yards in circumference. A fimilar cairn, 
but on a fmaller fcale, about a mile's diftance, was opened 50 
years ago, and in, or toward the centre, was found a kind of 
ftone coffin, containing fomething like fragments of humaa

Name, Situation, Extent^ Soil, isfc. 
HIS parifli derives its name from Convent Town. It 



Jo, is in the county of Lanark, prefbytery of Biggar, and 
fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale. Its length from fouth to 
3Jorth is 3 miies, and its breadth 2. It is bounded on ths 
«aft by Libbeirton ; on the weft by Carmichael ; on the fouth 
by Symington and Wifton ; and on the north by Pittenain. 
There is fome barren heath } but the foil is in general fertile. 
The haughs of Clyde are moftly of a good quality, but they 
are fuhjeil to inundation ; which, though pernicious at certain 
feafons, at others enriches the ground, and fupplies the place 
of manure. Part of the country i? mountainous. Tinto is 
172® feet above the level of the Clyde. 

^Agriculture, ^c. — Every farmer keeps two ploughs at leaft ; 
one of them is the old Scottifh, and the other Small's. There 
are about 630 acres in tillage yearly : About 90 in barley, Co 
in peafe, 70 in potatoes and turnip, 10 in lint, and the remain- 
der in oats. There are about 60 acres of fown grafs. Oats arc 
fown in March, and barley in the beginning of May. The 
beft croft land is let at L. x : i : o per acre ; the befl pafture 




at 



of Covington, 



at lis.; the worft at 2 s. 6 d. The average rent of farms is 
L. 50. The rent of the parifli is L. ^20 per annum. If in- 
clofurcs are furrounded with wood, the farmers are convin- 
ced of their great utility. Harveft, in general, commences 
about the beginning of September. The parilh ufually ex- 
ports one- fourth of the produce. In 1782, three-fourths of 
the crop were deftroyed by the froft. in 1783, the crop was 
remarkably good, leed being procured at a diftance, and the 
fafon being favourable. The heritors gave a generous aflif- 
tance to their tenants. Hence, the bad efFecls of the feafon 
1782 were not fo leverely felt as was at firft dreaded, Ihe 
oat meal fold at h. 1:6:0 per load of 16 Itone. The far- 
mers who were lo fortunate as to have any of the for- 
mer crop, got an additional price for it : Bui this fell heavy 
on the poor labourer; efpecially as he was often obliged to re- 
main idle, the tenants being unable to employ him. 

Population. — Fifty years ago, the inhabitants were 600. The 
principal caufe of the depopulation fince that time has been 
the enlarging of the farms The return to Dr Webfter was

The value of the ftipend is L. 80. Mr Lockhart of Carn- 
tvath is patron. 

Antiquities. — Within the bounds of this parifh there arc 
four camps, all of a circular form, furrounded with one or 
two deep ditches. One named the Caftledykes has two fub- 
terranean palTages, leading from the eaft gate. There are two 
large cairns of ftones, one ftanding on a hill called Wallbrae, 
meafuring in circumference 107 yards. There are many 
fmaller ones in an adjoining moor. Several have been open- 
ed, which contain a coarfe coffin, compofed of flat ftones. 
The other large cairn ftands on the top of Tinto, which fig- 
nifies a hill of fire y and is faid to have taken its name frorti 
the Druids keeping a continued fire on the top of this cairn. 
On a round hill at the foot of Tinto there is a circle, fur'- 
irounded with large ftones, ereftcd on one end, clofe to one 
another. At the diftance of 10 yards, there is another wall, 

iiearlv

nearly refembllng the former. In this place a large mound 
of earth is erefted. This was probably a (herifF'.s court, where, 
on a certain day, the adjacent country attended to have juf- 
tice done. The name of the adjncent farm feems to favour 
this tradition, for it is called Sheriff flats. According to im- 
memorial tradition, a bullock's ikin full of gold lies buried in 
this pJace. Covington was formerly the leat of a knight ba- 
ronet named Lindfey : In 1420, the laird applied, and ob- 
tained leave from parliament to build a fort, which was finiih- 
ed in 1442. The walls are 10 feet thick. It was made 
ftrong by every circumftance that art could invent. An old 
fword of very large fize, called Wallace's, is llill preferved. 
The ruin continues a grand and majiiftic objeft. 

M'lfcellaneous Ob/ervat'wtis. — The fuel ufed here Is coal. The 
diftance from the coal hill is about 9 miles : The price there 
is 3 d per cwt. When laid down here, the price is nearly 
doubled. There is one village called Thankerton, beauti- 
fully fituated on the river Clyde. There is a bridge over the 
Clyde at this village, built in 1778 by public contribution. It 
is kept in repair by the county. The roads are made and 
repaired by the ftatute labour commuted. The people, in 
general, iuppofe that turnpike roads would be of advantage. 
Some farmers in this pariih purfue improvements with fpirit ; 
but the climate ftruggles againft them. Plantations of wood 
in this part of the country would be of great advantage. The 
inhabitants, in general, are very humane, induftrious, decent, 
and devout. None have enlifted in the army lince 1778.

Situation, Extent^ Soil, and Surface. 
'HIS parifh is in the ftewartry of Kirkcudbright, and in 



JL the prrfbytery and fynod of Dumfries. Jt is bounded 
by the river Nith on the eart j by the parlfh of New Abbey 
on the fouth ; by Lochrutton on the wed ; and Terregles on 
the north. It is about 71 miles long, and about 4^ broad. 
The foil is various, but generally light. Mofs and moor form, 
perliaps, the fourth part of the parifh The country is partly 
fiat, and partly hilly. Part of the hills is covered with heath 
or coarfe grafs. There are few rocks. 

Rivers. — The river Nith produces falmon and fea trout, 
which yield in the fpring 6 d. per Englifh lb. ; 3 d. and i^d. 
per lb. in fummer and harveft. In the two laft feafons they 
are in greateil perftdtion. Nith is navigable with large vef- 
lels at the foot of the parifh ; and in the middle with fmall 
lime and coal ones from England. Sea mud comes up this 
river, and is ufed for manure with much fuccefs.

is - - - - - L. 9JO 

.Hence, the prcfent rental is five times the rental in 1752. i liis 
vaft rile of land in rroquire is in a great meafure owing to 
the people having abandoned a wretched mode of hufban- 
dry, in which they laid all tneir dung upon 3, 4, or 5 acres, 
of a field adjoining to the houfe, which they called crofthig 
land, upon which they yearly fowed b.^ar or barley, that 
yiel led the farmers only four or five ior one, owing to it^ be- 
ing choaked with weeos. The reit of the farm had no other 
man -re but what dropped from the cattle in the field ; con- 
fequently, their outfield crop, being oats, was very poor, and 
could Icarcely pay the labour. 

Laying lime upon the land, which began near 40 years ago, 
rhiefly contributed to the improvement of the land and the 
rile of rent. Some little (hell marie and fea mud, which were 
only got on fb ne farms, were likewife ufed. 1 hefe means of 
improvement introduced a fenfible mode of hufbandry, and 
will account for the great rife of land in Troquire, together 
with the increafed pnce of cattle and grain.

The rotation of crops in the greateft part of the parifh 
is ufually as follows : In the 1 ft year of breaking up land 
oats are fown ; 2d year fallow or potatoes ; the land is ma- 
nured ; 3d year wheat ; 4th year barlev, or foxnetimes oats, 
with rye grafs and red clover; 5th year rye grafs and clover; 
6th year, the preceding rotation is recomn enced. Oats are 
the prevailing grain. The beft arable land in the parifh near 
Dumfries is rented at L. i : 10 : o per acre : There are icvi at 
L. 2. Arable land fown with grafs feeds yields, the firft 
year, about L. 2 i i o : o, when the produce is (old for hay ; 
the fecond year about L. 2. The rent of arable land, in ge- 
neral, is from 25 to 18 (hillings per acre. The farms are ge- 
nerally inclofed; and the t( nants find much advantage from 
inclofures. Wheat is ufually fown about the beginning of 
OcVober; oats in March and April; barley in April and May. 
"Wheat and barley are ufually reap d m the beginning of Sep- 
tember, and oats about the middle ; in dry fummers fooner. 
Two things are flill wanting to make the agriculture more 
perfect ; a(fiduiry to increafe manure by comports, ftraw yards, 
&amp;c ; and attention to keep the horles always employed, which 
might be done if fallowing were increafed. What is called 
the ferv'ttude of tenants^ and hailie work, to the proprietors of 
land, is now almoft: entirely aboiifhed in this parilli. It was 
a cruel mode of oppreflion.

THIS parifli takes its name from the river Aron, which 
divides the counties cf Linlithgow and Stirling, 't is 
fituated in the latter, although it belongs to the prefbytery of 
Linlithgow, and fynod of Lothian. It is bounded by the 
parifhes of Borrowftounnefs, Linlithgow, Torphichen, Pol- 
mort and Slamanan. It is about 6 miles long, and 2 broad. 
The eaft end is of a light gravelly foil ; the reft clay, with a 
mixture of mofs and moor. A coniiderable part of the pa- 
rifli has been inclofed within thcfe few years. The farms are 
very fmall: The rents commonly are high : The harveft ear- 
ly. There are 50 ploughs in the parifii ; and no farmer has 
more thnn one. As the farais are fmall, grafs parks are com- 
monly taken from year to year for feeding cattle. More corn 
is railed than is necefTary to fupply the parifli. Twenty 
acres cf lint were fown laft year. The rental of the pariflx 
may be about L. 20CO.

■the number of fouls amounts only to 1065. Of thefe, there 
are 302 under 10 years of age. The oldeft man in the parifh 
is 90. The barony of Almond has been all laid out in grafs, 
and the farm houfes have become ruinous. This may be af- 
figned as one caufe, and it feems to be the principal one, of 
the decreafe of the population ; but that eftate being now all 
•inclofed, confiderable plantations made, and to be let out in 
commodious farms, will add greatly to the beauty and popu- 
lation of the place. The annual average of births is 45 ; 
deaths 35 ; but the Seceders, in general, do not infert their

l^ame^ Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface. 

THE name of this parlfli is probably derived from pendens 
pons, an arciied bridge, there being a bridge of one fe- 
imicircular arch, fupported by two fteep rocks, over the river 
Scarr. It is of very remote antiquity ; nor is it known when it 
was built. The fingularity of the ftrudture, when nothing 
of that kind exifted here, might give occafion to the name. 
At any rate, the name of the parifli is very antient, as ap- 
pears from infcriptions on the communion cups, in the be- 
ginning of the 14th century. Penpont is a prefbytery feat, 
and is fituated in the fynod and county of Dumfries. It is 
bounded by nine parifhes, Glencairn, Tynron, Keir, Clofe- 
burn, Morton, Durrifdeer, Sanquhar, New Cumnock, and 
Dairy. New Cumnock is in the prefbytery of Air, Dairy in 
that of Kirkcudbright. The parilh is i6Scottifli ftatute miles 
long, and, at an average, about 3i broad. It extends from 
fouth-eafi:, at the lower extremity, by a continual afcent, to 
the north.wefl, where the ground on the banks of the Scarr, 
which has its fource there, is 3500 feet above the level of the 
river at the lowefi: part of it. In this tract there are 4 fteep 
ridges, lengthways, with 3 deep and narrow glens, each wa- 
tered by a very pure and plentiful ftream.

The lower end is waflied by the Nith, a confiderable rivei'jj 
which divides Penpont from Durrifdeer and Morton, and by- 
the Scarr, which is the march between it and Tynroa and' 
Keir. On the fouth-wefl, the Scarr runs between Penpont 
and Tynrcn for 5 miles. The hills on both fides are fo fteep 
and high, and the bottom fo narrow, rocky, and woody, that 
the general view is pleafant to thofe who have any tafte for 
romantic fcenes. At Chanlockfoot, the ridge, which fprings 
up fuddenly between two valleys, has its face wholly covered, 
with trees, and the other, farther up, with grafs of a beauti- 
ful green, both of which views are particularly delightful. In 
the bofom of the north-eafl; ridge you difcover Glenquhargen 
Graig, almoit perpendicular, and above 1000 feet in heighth. 
It has two faces that ftrike the eye, and no other rock is to be 
feen on either fide. It is a hard brownifh whin flone. Some 
fmall pieces are fallen down, with fliarp edges and angular 
points. It is one of the greatefi: curiofities In the fouth of Scot- 
land. The north-eafl: fide is bounded by the Mar-burn, which, 
lower down, is called the Canal. The general profpedl down 
the rivers Nith and Scarr is extcnfive and beautiful, confift- 
ing of level ground highly cultivated, gentle rifings, woods, 
villas, and mountains. The manfe and church ftand on a 
plain, about 30 feet above the Scarr, which winds about, in 
the form of an S, from fouth- weft to north-eaft. There is 
from hence a diftinfV view of the rivers for 8 miles, firft fe- 
parate and then united. The pools here and there fliew them- 
felves as fmooth fheets of water •, and in floods the low ground- 
is inundated for a mile broad, and 6 farm towns furrounded to 
the very doors. Profpedls worthy of notice every where pre-

fide to fide : A little farther down, tlie Shinnel, between high, 
and woody banks, runs into the Scarr at right angles. At 
this fpot is a large cairn, and the upper end of a fine fheet of 
water ; 3. mills, and the houfes belonging to them, in a cluf- 
ter; the dam-dyke, 18 feet above the rock, clofe to, and be-

various lliapes. 

Cairnkinnow is a high mountain ftanding in the middle 
of the parilh, and towards the north-eaft fide ; the precife 
hetghth unknown ; but it is the higheH: land in this line be- 
tween the Friths of Solway and Clyde. From the top of it 
may be feen Airfhire, Clydefdale, Annandale, and Cialloway j-

The foil is In general fandy, in fome places light, but mo(l:» 
ly deep, and capable of great improvement by lime, which, in 
15 years, has made an uncommon alteration on the face of 
this part of the country. The hills are green, except a few 
that are covered with a fliort heath, 

AgricuUurey Isfc. — The Scottifli plough is chiefly ufed, on 
account of the fmall ftones fo frequent in a fandy foil. Sow~ 
ing commonly begins on the ift of March, and reaping about 
the middle of Auguft. All the common kinds of grain, and 
turnip, potatoes, clover, and rye-grafs, are raifed with fuccefs. 
About 138 acres are fown with barley annually, and 25 with 
wheat. In this neighbourhood land lets from 1 8 s. to i 1. 5 s, 
per acre. The real rent of the parfli is L. 2,500, which, in

the laft 15 years, has been increafed L. 900. There afe 
many inclofures ; and the difpofition to inclofe feems to irl- 
creafe. 

Rivers, ^c. — Near the Scarr, which rife^ at the head of 
Penpont, are likewife the fources of the Ken, whofe coiirle 
extends to Kirkcudbright ; of Afton, which falls into the 
Nith near New Cumnock i and of the Youghan, which joins 
the Nith at Sanquhar. The Scarr runs down the middle of 
the parifh 12 miles, and for 6 nlore divides it from Tynron 
and Keir. A vaft water fpout, accompanied with tremen- 
dous thunder and lightning, emptied itfelf near the fource of 
the Scarr in July 1783. Every one here was furprifed by an 
uncommon flood in the evening. Herds of cattle, and their 
keepers, were fuddenly furrounded : People at work were 
obliged to flee for fear of being inclofed. Hay and timber 
were carried off ; one ftone bridge and a houfe, with the wool 
of 1200 flieep, were fwept away: Dreadful gulphs of whole 
acres were made on the face of the hills. There are 15 brooks 
in this parifli. The tifli in the rivers or brooks are falmon, 
caught chiefly in July and Auguft, and fold at 3 d. per lb. ; 
fea-trout 5 hirlings, caught in the fame months ; burn-trout, 
pikes, eels, and parrs. Dovvloch is a fmall lake on the top 
of a hill, and famous, in the reign of fuperflition, for curing 
all manner of difeafes. Thofe who reforted to it for relief 
left fome part of their drefs to the guardian demon or faint; 
By all accounts it has fome mineral qualities. 

Population. — The population of this parifli has increafed up- 
wards of 100 within thefe 15 years, owing chiefly to the di- 
vifion of fome large farms. The return to Dr Webfter, how- 
ever, was 857.

Poor. — The poor in Penf ont are tolerably provided for. 
None go about a&amp;Ing alms except 2 lunatics. The kirk- 
feffion has L. 450 at intereft. The Duke of Queenfberry 
gives a bounty of upwards of L. 10, and likewife 25 ftories 
of oat-meal. The coUedlions are L. 1 2 per annum. The 
whole annual amount of the contributiLns for the poor, who 
confift of 25 families, and feveral individuals, is about L. 46. 
Their principal food is oat-meal and potatoes. The articles 
of clothing, efpecially fhoes, are far more expenfive than 
formerly; fuel has alfo advanced in price. The rent of 
houfes is tripled. "When a perfon ftands in need of a 
nurfe as well as neceffaries, a relation commonly takes the 
charge, and the feffion pays at the rate of L. 5 per annum.

failure of crop in 17G2 was lefs felt here than In many otlier 
parts of the kingdom. The poor belonging to the Camero- 
nlans and Seceders receive fupplies from the parochial funds ; 
yet not one of thefe fefts contribute a farthing to the main- 
tenance of the parifh poor : Moreover, many of the eftablilh- 
ed church attend their meetings on particular days, which 
adds to their collections. 

Wages. — Labourers have fufficient employment, and are 
able to fupport their families. The wages of a man fervant, 
employed in the operations of hufbandry, were L. 2 per annum 
40 years ago ; now they are L. 7. The wages of a woman 
fervant, 40 years ago, were 13 s. 4 d. ; now L. 3. About 
40 years ago, a day labourer received 6 d. without viftuals, 
now he receives i s. Carpenters wages are i s. 4 d. a day ; 
mafons i s. 8 d. ; taylors i s. They are all doubled. A man 
during harveft, 40 years ago, got 8 s. 4 d. ; a woman 5 s. Now^ 
a man gets L. 1:3:0, and a woman 18 s. Few reap by the 
day, but, when they do, they receive from 10 d. to i s. 2 d. 
without victuals. 

Church and Stipend. — The church was rebuilt in 1782. It 
-is pleafantly fituated on an eminence on the Scarr. The fti- 
pend is L. 86 : 2 : 2, with a glebe worth L. 1 1, confifting of 

acres. The Duke of Q^eenfberry is patron. 

Improvements Sugge/?ed.-r-The repairing of roads, fearching 
for coal, lead, and iron mines, might be attended with ad- 
vantage. The divifion of fome farms, and the eftablifhmcnt 
"Of a woollen manufactory, in particular, would be of great 
benefit. Vaft quantities of wool and vfoollen yarn are car- 
ried out of this, and the neighbouring pariflies, to a great 
^diftance. Penpont is fo centrical, that it is faid the farmers

advance on the price. This parifti produces annually for fale 
sbove 1500 ftoncs heavy weight, that is, 24 lbs. Englifh each; 
aod iCjOOO might be found in the circle, befides fome finer 
wool, at no great diflance, for particular ufes. Wool has been 
fold thefc two lalt years at 5 s. 6d. the ftone, and for the fix 
preceding years confiderably cheapeir. The late demand from 
England raifed the price. 

Antiquities. — An old Roman caiifeway runs through Tyn- 
ron dole to the edge of the Scar. There are 2 moats of earth, 
I oblifk, and 4 very large cairns. The veftiges of Tiber's caflle, 
which has been a large building, are to be feen on the banks 
of the Nith, A fmall part &amp;f the wall neit the riv^r remains. 
Foffae are vifible, and fome entrenchments where it was 
moft accefllble. It is fuppofed that the barony of Tiber is 
named from Tyber, or Tiberius. There is a Roman en- 
campment too. The Englifli had a garrilon in this caftle in 
the time of Sir William Wallace, who took it by furprife. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — White and red free ftone, and 
whitilh grey with red i pecks, abound in the lower part of 
the parifh. There is cals. ftone, and plenty of ruddle. Elue 
grey, and brownifti whin, are very abundant. Arches of bridges 
are built with whin. Water ftone is a blue grej , drelTes neatly, 
and is ufed in building. There are fome rocks compofed of 
fpar, whin, and lime ftone. Large tranfparent white ftones are 
found at the head of Glenmannaburn. There are fome mineral 
fprings, but of little note, impregnated with iron. Marie is 
found in feveral bogs. There are indications of lead, iron, and

to which the river Amen, the boundary of the two (hires, 
falls at the village of Nether Cramond. It is in the prefby- 
terv of Edinburgh, and the fynod of Lothian and Tweed- 
^ale. It is boundfd on the weft by the panlhes of Dal-

of the parifii becomes more variegated than the eaftern fide, 
being diverfified with rifing grounds in ieveral places. But 
the principal ornament of the wefl: part is tlie river Amon, 
whofe banks, from above Craigiehall to Nether Cr.imond, 
are high and ftcep, ahnoft wholly covered with wood, and 
frequently chequered with bold and overhanging rocks The 
land rifes in general to fome heighth, even clofe to the. 
fea fhore ; there are, however, in three or four places 
along the (here, fandy plains or links. The length of the 
parifl-i may be about 6 miles ; and the breadth fcarcely ever 
exceeds i ; though the fhape is rather irregular, affuniing at 
the weft end a kind of furcated figure. It contains in all 
about 3890 Scott;fh acres, including the two fmall iflands of 
Cramond and Inchmickery. 

Name. — The parlHi is denominated from the principal vil- 
lage, where the church ftands, called Cramond, fituated at 
the mouth of the Amon. Cramond appears evidently to be 
a contradlioa of Caeramsn^ derived from Amon, a Celtic word, 
fignifying a river in general, and Caer, which, in the fame 
language, fignifies a fort, viz. the Fort on the Amon. 

ManufaBures. — The iron manufavflure carried on by MefTrs 
Cadells and Edington, who now employ a capital of above 
L. 30,000, confifts of 3 forges, 2 flitting mills, and 2 ftecl 
furnaces, at which bar iron is manufactured into bliilered, 
fquare or faggot, and German fteel, hoops and rolled iron, 
rod iron, boiler and pan plates for fire-engines, fockmoulds, 
anchor palms, bolts for fhip building, and other articles. 
Above 30 men and boys are employed immediately at the 
works, loine of whom earn 26 s. per week, and none make 
lefs than 4 s. There are alfo here fpade and nail manufac- 
tures belonging to the fame company, in which above 450 

cwt.

cwt. of naU!, and 1000 dozen of fpades, are annually made j 
and a file ijanuf.i-ihire has been lately eflablifhed. Thefc 
three branches employ about 50 men and boys, who make 
from 3 s. to 20 s. per week. Much fteel is exported frora 
hence to India ; and the greatefl part of the rod iron made 
here is fent to .Stirlini;lhire, where the Cramond company 
employ above 00 iiien to manufadtuie it into nails, of which 
lar^c quantities were, before the late war, exported to Aiue- 
rica. 

The iron ufed at the Cramond works comes chiefly from 
Ruflla a id Sweden, upwards of 1000 tons being imported 
from the Baltic yearly. The aver^ige coft per ton (including 
culloms at 5'. s. and freight from 8 s. to 15 s.) is L. 17 lor 
RufEa, and L. 18 : ic : c f.r hwedilh iron ; but a very tine 
kind of the latter, the p; ojuce of the famous mine of Danne- 
mora in Upland, cal'ed Oeregrund's iron, from the port where 
it is fhipped, comes to L. 24 [jer ton. This fort iS ufed folely 
for making fieel. * hefe different kir.ds of iron are 50 per 
cent, dearer than they were in 1780, which rapid advance 
has l.itely mduced the proprietors to ercft furaaces at Clyde, 
near Gl ngow, with the view of making bar iron for Cra- 
mond, wliich they hope will, in a few years, furnifh them 
with lufEcient materials, and fave the gr.-at lums remitted 
for that article The Cramond works are luppiied with coal 
from the Grange, near Borrowfiounnefs, a property of the 
Meffrs Cadells, and they annually confume about 1600 tons, 
which are bro'.giu in floops for is 6d. per ton freight ; prime 
coft and o. her charges may be about 7 s. The forge ham- 
mers weigh from 4 to 6 cv/t. each, are wrought by water, 
and make from 120 to 160 (trokes in a minute. Thefe ham-

rent is equal to about two-fifths ot the produce. 

Crops. — Hay is the principal article raifeJ in this diflrldt, the 
great demand for that commodity at Edinburgh, fecuring 4 
conftant market. It is produced from red and yellow clover- 
feed, mixed with rye-grafs, and is cut early. The frequent 
repetition of this crop has leffened the returns ; formerly 8 
or 10 pounds of clover- leed, along with 2 bufhels of ryc- 
grafs, were fufficient for an acre, and produced great crops 
two years fucceflively ; now it is found difficult to raife hay 
the fiscond year, although double the quantity of clover-feeJ 
b ufcd. Thefe feeds are lown with the foregoing crop of 
barley, wheat, or oats, the ground being well pulverized. 
Hay is a great favourite of the farmers, being an article eafy 
to difpofe of, and cheaply reaped ; the expencc of cutting 
and making fcldom exceeds 5 s. an acre, even when the acre 
produces above 200 flones. Sometimes, though rarely, a fe- 
cond crop is made in the fame year. 

Wheat takes the lead of all other grain here, the farmers 
being induced to fow as great a quantity as poffible, in order 
that its lucrative returns may better enable them to pay the 
high rents common in the parifh. It is fown in every fitua- 
tion, on every foil, and often with very lutle attention to the 
ftate of the ground, by which, and by frequently repeating 
this impoverifliing article, the crops are by no means fo good 
as they were formerly. Of this alteration the farmers are now 
become fenfible j and, though they ftill endeavour to have a 
confiderable portion of their lands in wheat, they are more 
attentive to have the ground on which it is fown in good con- 
dition. Summer fallow, potatoes, beans and peafe, and rng-

now to be the fyflems moft generally adopted for preparing 
the land to bear a crop of wheat. 

Beans and peafe, fingly or mixed together, are raifed in 
confiderable quantics ; parf is Town in drills and regularly 
horfe hoed, though this practice is far from being general. 
Oats are ftill much cultivated, though not in fo great a pro- 
portion to ofher g.ain as formerly. Dutch oats have, in 
fome places, lately been fubftitutcd mitead of barley ; as they 
are well adapted to late fowmg, and thus enaole the farmer 
to work his land in the lame manner as for barley. A large 
quantity of bariey was formerly raifed in this diitrict, where 
the whole dung of the farm yard was ufually put on the bar- 
ley h:nd, which with frequent ploughings, iniured a lucrative 
vetrrn. But of late, the dung bcng almol'f entirely allotted 
to the wheat, the barley has declined in quality, and be- 
come fo unprolihc, that lome farmers have entirely given up 
that article, Ibbltituting ;n us place Dutch oats as before 
mentioned, i he quantity of bariey produced in the parifh^ 
is, howex er, by no n^eans trifling. 

Potatoes form a great article of produce, the vicinity of 
Edinburgh affording an opportunity of difpofing of them to 
advantage. There are fome turnips, cabbages, carrots, and 
yams, cultivated here, though the quantity is very fmall. 
The yams are a very j)roduftive crop, never yielding lefs 
than 50 bolls, and fometimes 100, of 28 if ones each, per 
acre, even without dunging the land. No part of the pafture 
ground islet at lefs than 30s. an acre, and fome i^ields a 
rent of 45 s. and 50 s. the produce is therefore moderately 
efti mated at 40s. per acre.

loads are annually brought into this diftncl, that, one with 
another, coft about i s. prime coft, and is. 6 d. for car-

ing it beconimg very expenfivej is now difcontinued, and the 
pits are drowned. 

Implements of Hu^atidry.—r-Smcill's chain plough, drawn by 
two horfes, is generally ufed, which is much preferable to 
the old Scots ploughs, that required four horfes and a dri- 
ver. Harrows are generally of the old kind, with 4 bulls and 
20 iron tecih, improved by flots inftead of rungs ; there are 
alfo fome of Lord Karnes's harrows uled here. Dung carts 
bold above 29 cubic feet, are mounted on flout narrow- 
wheels 4\ feet diameter, with iron axles, weigh about 5 cwt. 
altogether, and ufually carry 16 cwt., two horles being

yoked to each ; but fingle horfe carts are often ufed, in 
which it is aflerted one horfe can draw 12 cwt. as eafily as 
two do 16 in the former. Corn carts are fimple machines, 
mounted occafionally upon the wheels of the dung carts, for 
driving hay or unthrefhed grain. There are many drill 
ploughs J plenty of ftone rollers 5! feet long, and 14 inches 
diameter; a few of Mr Sandiland's fod-cutters j fonie very 
complete threfhing machines upon a large leak, and one of 
a peculiar conftru£i:ion invented by Mr Robertfon at Gran- 
ton, which, though by no means comparable in ftrength to 
the former, anfwers the purpofe fufficiently, and, cofting 
only L. 20, is within the reach of even the inferior order of 
fanners *. 

Draught Cattle. — All draught work in the parifh is per- 
formed by horles, which come chiefly from Linlithgow and 
Lanark fliires, meafure from 15 to 16 hands high, and cofl: 
from L. 16 to L. 20. There may be about i;oo horfes now 
employed in hufbandry work, whereas the number was for- 
merly double, when four horfes were almoft univerfally 
yoked to each plough. 

Prices of Labour. — There are about 100 ploughmen and 
carters, whofe annual wa^es are from L. 4 to L. 5 in money, 
i 6 s. for kitchen j-, 10 s. for two pair of fhoes, 6i bolls of 
oat-meal, diet in harveft, a free houfe and garden, the car-

may be moderately eftlmated at L. 13 ; a great increafe when 
compared with their wages in 1760, which were no more 
than L 8, including every article ; and even fo late as 1775, 
L. 9 was reckoned high emolument. Maid ferv^ms ot far- 
mers get L. 3 per annum, and are maintained in the houfe. 
Barnmen and other able-bodied labourers are paid at the 
rate of 5s. and 6s. per week, when conrtaiitly employed; 
when only occanonally, i s. 2 d per day. A mafon'b wages 
is I s- 8 d. a day, and a hay cutter's i s. 6 d. to i s,. 8 d. per 
day. Reapers get from 6d. to i s. a day, and maintenance 
during h i;'veft. Women working in the fields earn in ge- 
neral d a day, and are much better employed than former- 
ly, there now being a great deal of hoeing, weedmg, and 
picking performed by them, infomuch that they ufually hvive 
at leaft one half of the year outwork. When not thus em- 
ployed, they betake themfelves to fpmning, at which they 
feldom make more than 3d. a day. 

Work by the piece is now coming into ufe, in which corn 
is cut at 5s. per acre du an average, and threlhed at 6d. per 
boll. Hay is cut from is. 6d. to 3s. per acre, according tb 
the weight of the crop, and made in fome cafes at 2s. per 
acre. Stone and lime dikes built at 1 2s. per rood, materials 
being furniflied by the employer ; houfes, barns, and ftables 
at 25s. ditto;

Fi/heries.-^The fi(}ieries are at a low ebb, the oyfter fifti- 
crj being much degenerated from what it was about 5« 
years ago, when eleven large boats belon ing to Cramond 
were confkantly occupied during the feafon in dragging 
oyfters, the greateft part of which was fold to Dutch veffels at 
an average of 4s the herring barrel. The fcalps were then 
To producftive, that it was nfual for a boat with five hands to 
make ■^os. a day; but they are now fo much deftroyed, pro- 
bably with over fifhing, as to employ at prefent no more 
than 4 or 5 boats, and thefe only occafionally. The fcalps 
about Inch Mickery, belonging to Lady Greenwich, are let 
at a rent of L. 24 per afinum, to the Newhaven fiflicrs. 
The Amon formerly abounded with a variety of fifh, fuch as 
tronts, grilles*, fome lalmon, and great plenty of fmelts ; 
bi" 'A'ing to liming the adjacent grounds, and watering flax 
In the river, it was for fome years almofl: totally deferted by 
theic different kinds cf fiCh, which are ftill extremely fcarce. 
Whales have fometimes betn llranded on the fands here, parti- 
cularly in 1690, when no leis a number than 25, though of the 
very fmallelt fort, were left by the tide on rhe fliore fouth 
of Cramond Iflnnd ; and in 1769, two of the fpermaceti 
kind, each 5^ feet long, were cafl afliore not far from the 
village oi Cramond. 

Minerals — Frec-ftone abounds in feveral places, as alfo 
whin-ftone. iftoor-ftone, and granite. Iron-ftone is found 
along the fhore at Caroline Park \ and there is a great ap- 
pearance of coal on the fea fide in the eaftern part of Royf- 
toua, and the adjacent lands of Wardie, where large feams

arc perceivable both above and below the tide mark. The 
neighbouring people, when fuel is fcarce, often carry off from 
thence parcels of coal, though of an exceeding poor quality, 
A pit was funk in Piltoun wood in 1788, but was foon aban- 
doned on account of the badnefs of the coal ; and there are 
in the links of Royftoun the veftiges of feveral pits. On the 
lands of IVIarchfield is a fpring of mineral water, called the 
Well of Spaw, reckoned beneficial in fcorbutic cafes, and 
highly purgative when taken in quantitiee., 

Village of Cra7nond. — The village of Cramond, fituated on 
the eaft fide of the Amon, at its jundlion with the Forth, 
contains 74 families, 300 inhabitants, moflly iron workmen, 
failors, and day labourers. It has a harbour, (fpecified in the 
records of Exchequer as a creek within the port of Leith) 
to which belong 7 floops, chiefly employed by the iron works, 
meafuring 288 tons, and manned with 23 feamen and ap- 
prentices. The Amon is navigable only for the fpace of a 
quarter of a mile above its mouth. 

Churchy Patron, Stipend, and School, — The church was ori- 
ginally built in 1656, but has been frequently repaired and 
enlarged fince that time. The patron is Mr Ramfay of 
Barnton. The ftipend, as augmented in 1765, is, money, 
L. 58:5 :oi barley, 44I bolls; oats, 33! bolls; wheat, 10 
bolls; meal, 8 bolls; with a commodious manfe, and a glebe 
of above 5 acres of rich land. The fchoolmafler's falary is 
L. 10:2: II, with 4^ bolls of barley. The intereft of L. 25 
was granted by Sir John Inglis in 1786 for a Sunday fchool. 
The fees for writing and Englifla are i s. 4d. the quarter; 
for Arithmetic and Latin 3 s. There are befides two private 
fchools. The fcholars at the three fchools, taken together, 
may annually amount to 150.

Parochial Funds.— ^The parochial funds amount to above 
L. 1220, yielding an annualrent of above L. 56; the collec- 
tions at the church doors come to about L. 39 ; and the pro- 
fits of the mortcloths to above L- 7 annually; making a total 
yearly income of above L. 102. With this fum, 41 ordinary, 
and 1 6 extraordinary poor, are fupported and relieved, ac- 
cording to their feveral neceffities ; after vrhich there com- 
monly remains a fmall furplus, at the end of each year, to 
augment the capital fundi This is ftated from the average 
of the receipts and difburfements for 10 years pait, i icluding 
in the former the colleflions on facramemal occafioiis, the ave- 
rage of which L. 6:4:0 annually ; a trifling fum compared 
with the produce at the communion 1690, L. 20 : 5 : o, and 
1691, L. 23 : 15 : o. Towards the end of the laft, and begin- 
ning of the prelf-nt century, the annual contributions were 
much the fame as at prefent, while the average number of or- 
dinary poor is now more than doubled. 

Charitable Foundations. — Craigcrook mortification is an 
cftare above L. 'i,(. o per annum., which was mortified for 
charitable and pious ufes, but not confined to this parilh, by 
John Strachan of Craigcrook, about the 1720. The mana- 
gers are two Advocates, two Writers to the signet, and the 
whole Prefb"tcry of Kdinburgh, under the controul of the 
Lords of Sefiion ; and thefe managers are, in terms of the 
deed of mortification, direiTted " to employ a difcreet perfon 
*' to uplift the rents when due, and, as uplifted, to employ 
*« the fame as the forefaid perfons order, to poor old men, 
*« women, and orphans."

Even this number "has fince diminiflied', for Mr Bonar, 
the prefent minifter of Cramond, having very obhgmgly ta- 
ken a lift of the parifh, found, that, in the prefent year, 
1790, it contained 299 families only, and 11 12 louls. The 
caufes of this diminution in the numbers of the people are, 
4he removal of mechanics to towns, the failure of the oyfter 
fifliery, and the increafe of pafture ground. Some years ago, 
a large property, conGfting of five farms, was wholly turned 
into grafs, and ftill remains in the fame flate. 

Difeafes. — Agues, fome years ago, afFefted the common 
people fo much during the fpring and fummer months, that 
the neceflary husbandry work was with difficulty performed, 
for want of hands. This difeafe ufed to be exceedingly fc-

WC and dirtrcffing; but, fince the year 1775", It has almoft 
wholly dilaj^peared from this neighbourhood, which may be 
attributed, in a great meafure, to the thorough draining of 
the grounds. 

Roads and Seats. — ^The roads in this diftrin are kept in ex- 
cellent repair, being chiefly compofed of granite broken into 
finall pieces, and ftrewed on the middle ot the road ; after 
which, the fides and ditches are cltar d of rubbifh, which is 
thrown over, and foon incorporates with the ftoncs. 1 he 
public road from Edinburgh to Qucensferry, one of the plea- 
£mtett and moft frequented in Scotland, traverfes great part 
of the parilh. croffing the Amon at Cramond bridge. Many 
feats adorn this diPin(Sl. Royrtoun is one of the largcft hou- 
fes in the three Lotbians. 

Emhient Men. — Of perfons meriting to be particularly 
mentioned, the njoft diftinguiflied eminent men, who were 
either natives of, or relidcnt proprietors in, the parifli, are, 
ift, John Elphinftone, lecond Lord Balmerinoch, a noblcmau 
noted for his Ipirited oppolition to the tyrannical proceeding;, 
of Charles 1. for which he narrowly efcaped loling his head, 
and for being the beft frienc that the Covenanters ever had, 
as he fpent a great fortune in fupport of their caufe. 2d, Sir 
Thomas Hope of Grantoun, well known as one of the ablefl 
and moft fuccefsful lawyers at the fjcottifh bar, to whofe un- 
remitted exertions, and found advice, the firm eftablifhnient 
of the Preflsyterian mode of worfiiip in this kingdom is in a 
great meafure owing. 3d, Sir William Hope of Grantoun., 
his grandfon, who was diftinguifhed for fuperior proficiency 
in all the fafliionable accomplifliments of the times in which 
he lived, particularly for great flciU in fencing, on which he

IVlackenzie, firit Earl of Cromarty, whoie numerous works 
are well known. 5th, John Law of Laurifton, Comptroller 
General of the Finances in France, one of the moft extraor* 
dinary charaflers that this or any other country has produ- 
ced, to whole great merit and abilities fufficient juftice has 
not yet been done. 6th, George Cleghorn, an eminent phy- 
fician in Dublin, the firit perlcn that eftablifhed what could, 
with any degree of propriety, be called an anatomical Ichool

his uncle George, juft now mentioned, as Profeflbr of Ana-

178J, at the age of 28, univerfally regretted. 

Mifcellaneous Objervations. — There are 2 coaches, and 4 four- 
wheeled chaifes m this parilh j 7 licenled ale-houks. 1 he 
corruption among the lower clafTes, fays the Rev. Mr Bonar, 
the minifler, is mournful ; as perhaps in few country pariflies, 
the liberties and vices of the town are any where more accu- 
rately copied.

<p>

Situation and Extent. 

THIS parifh is fituated in the fhire and prefbytery of 
Linlithgow, in the fynod ot Lothian and Tweeddale. 
It is, from eaft to weft, near 4 miles long, and between 2 and 
3 broad t It is bounded on the eafl: by the parifh of Craniond; 
on the fouth by Cramond and Kirkbfton ; on the well by 
Abercorn; and on the north by the Firth of Forth, There 
is a diftridl of it upon the weft, not included within the above 
limits, called Auldcathy, entirely disjoined from it by the pa- 
rifhes of Abercorn and Kirklifton, and which antiently, it is 
faiJ, formed a feparate parilh. The lands of Auldcathy are, 
from eaft to weft, about a mile and a half long ; and, from 
fouth to north, near a mile broad. They lie about 4 miles 
eaft from Linlithgow; partly upon the fouth, and partly up- 
on the north, of the great road between Linlithgow and jLdia- 
burgh. 

Name, and Language, — Dumanay, the original name of the 
parifli, is faid to mean, in the Gael c, a black heath; of wh'ch, 
probably, a great portion of the higher grounds in it once 
conlifted. The Gaelic, or Celtic, was the ougmal tongue of 

the 



Statljlkal Account 



the whole Ifland ; and Gaelic names, it may be obfcrved, ftlll 
prevail to a very great extent in it, particularly in Scotland ; 
for, although a foreign language was brought hither from 
the Continent by the anceftors of the greater part of the pre- 
fent inhabitants, many original names, particularly thofe of 
places, were naturally retained. Thus, Dundas (a plnce in 
this pari(h) is laid to be the Gaelic for " hill of fallow deer *i" 
Mons hill, for a *' hill uncultivate !." Inftances of fuch deri- 
vations are numerous in the neighbourhood, and elfewhere ; 
as the Forth, or the " watery" Inch Garvy, or " rough ifland j" 
KirUi/ion, or ** a place inclofed on a river Linlithgoiv, or 
" dog's pool Torphichetty or «* light-hill j" Calder, or " oak- 
" wood " The languag which was brought from the Con- 
tinent, and which is now general over the Ifland, was partly 
introduced by the Anglo Saxons, in the fifth century, into 
England ; and partly by the Dano-Saxons, in the ninth and 
eleventh, both into England and Scotland. The Dano-Saxon 
has continued to be fpoken in the greater part of Scotland, 
and particularly what is called the Lo-wlands, with little devi- 
ation from the original, till near the prefent times, in which 
it has been giving place very rapidlv to the modern Englifli 
language. i he caufe of this, independent of the compara- 
tive merits or demerits of the two diak£t-, has been the union 
of the Scottifh and Englifh crowns ; from which, as England 
is the larger and wealthier country, and is, befides, the court 
end of the Ifland, the Englifh tongue has gained the afcen- 
dancy, and become the standard of faftiion and of propriety. 

Surfac* 

* Horns of deer have lately been dug up in its fklrts ; and 
feme bones ot fuch dimenfions, as ren'ier it probable that they 
belonc;ed to the moofe-deer, or fome other of the iargeft of the 
ftag fpecies.

I Surface and Air. — The pariih lies high In the- middle, de- 
dines fonewhat to the weft, has a very confi.lerable declivity 
to the fouth, and ftill more to the north, where it teruiinues 
With a bold bank upon the Forth Within it are thri'e long 
rorky and woody ridges, or rather little hills, Mous-hill, 
Diindas hill, and Craigie hill j thf" prorpe£is from which are 

■ both rem-jric ibly exfenfive and divcriltled The view from 
Mons-h 11, in particular, has been celebrated for its almoft 
unequalled compafs and beauty. Standing upon the top of 
this riiige, you fee the aiotintain of Ben-Lomond on rh" weft ; 
the Ochil and Lomond hills to the nortli ; North Berwick- 
Law, the Bafs, and Ifl; of May, to the eart: ; Pentland and 
Lammer-muir hills to the foath. Befides the Forth, and the 
numerous towns, villages, leats, woo iy hills, and rifing 
grounds, on each bank of it, the charmin^ park of Barn- 
bougie hes immediately uiiJcf iIk eye, ch.ir idterif:d frits 
bold waving furtace, compofed of the fincft heights and lawns, 
and alfo for the variety, elegance, and fancy, of the rides 
within it- circuit. The pro!pec\ extends, fn general, as far 
as the eye can reach ; and fixteen counties, m whole or in 
p.irt, are faid to be within the view. Different travellers have 
remarked, that this fcenery is among the fineft in Europe^ 
This may account for the ialuDnty of the ai", for which the 
parilh has been noted •, owing, perhap , to its high fi ntion, 
and to Its being guarded from the eaft and weft wi . is by 
th*" h.lls w thin its bounds. The village of Dal nenv, which 
lies delightfully fituated, nearly in the line between Mons- 
hill and Dundas-h-ll, is, from this circumftance, protecled 
from the north- eaft and fouth-weft winds ; the former the 
nioft baleful, and the latter fhe moil violent, in this country. 
The longevity of its inhab'tants has been often remarked : 
Mr Nafmith, the late minifter, who was 63 years in office 
here, died at 9 1 ; Mrs Nafmith near the lame 3i^e ; the fchool- 

mafter 



Stal'i/lical Account 



mafter and beadle above 80 ; fo that the four contemporaries 
made up above 340 years. Near this village, three perfons 
of one family died this year, whofe ages, taken together, were 
about 240 years. From the parifh regifter it appears, that, 
in the courfe of thefe 36 years part, 35 perfons have died 
between 50 and 60 years of age ; 48 between 60 and -/O ; 58 
between 70 and 80 26 between 80 and 90 ; and 3 at 90 
and upwards. The purity of the air has, among other con- 
fiderations, occafioned a great number of gentlemens fons to 
be feiit as boarders to the parifii fchool here. 

Soiit Acres^ and Rent. — The foil of the higher grounds is, 
in general, a (hallow poor clay, for the moft part on a cold 
bottom, and which, in feveral places, borders on till. That 
of almoft all Auldcathy is nearly the fame. The harveil, on 
this account, is near two weeks later than in the neighbouring 
parlfhes of Cramond and Kirklifton. At the lame tmie, there 
are fome confiderable tra£ts, particularly the declivities and 
lower lying Isncis, which are a good loam ; but, in feveral 
places, intermixed with fand. In this parilh are alfo a few 
fpots of what is called perpetual foil^ exceedingly fertile, 
and which have had no dung, it is faid, in the memory of 
nian. Part of the niinifter's garden is of this kind, which 
has been long known to produce great crops ; and, of late, 
.furpriling ones of potatoes have been reared. For experi- 
ment's fake, potatoes were lately planted on a portion of it, 
fix years running, and the laft crop was as good as the hrft. 
Dung V.MS ap^Jied one year, but the plants ran to ftalks and 
leave- ; the roots were numerous, but very fmall. The num- 
ber of acres in the whole  arifli is above 4500. Hills, plan- 
tations, avenues, &amp;c. may occupy about 500 of thefe; about 
2:;oo are in p'.'bjre, and i"oo in tillage. Rent is from 6 s. 
to 40 s. the acre ; The j;reater part lets at from 20 s. to 30 s.; 

the 



aj Dalmeny* 93 1 

the beft land from 30s. to 4 OS. Fhe total rent cannot be 
exadtly afccrtained, as in fome farms it is partly paid in 
viflual, the price of which varies every year ; but it may 
probably be eftimated at abjut L. jooo Sterling yearly. Thg 
valued rent is L. 9620 Scots. 

Culture.— Yrom the nature of the foil, which Is in great 
part wet, the difficulty in culture is to keep the lands clean ; 
hence turnip crops alfo, and ihe winter feeding of cattle, are 
in many places debarred. On account of the diftance 
from great towns, dung can hardly be conveyed thence j and 
little more of courfe is ufed, than what is made on each par- 
ticular farm. There is a bed of fliell marl in a marlh ad- 
joining to Dundas-hillj but it has been little wrought. Lime, 
which is in the near neighbourhood, has been applied to a 
confiderable extent. The principal white crop railed, is 
oats ; next barley and %vheat. The rotation has here, as in 
fo many other places, been much amended of late years, by 
introducing green crops, and by fumn:ier fallor/ing ; two of 
the moft capital improvements in hufbandry. Two horie 
ploughs upon Smali's j'lan, another great improvement, are 
alfo coming into general ufe. Almoft every farm is enclofed 
and fubdivided by hedges, hedgerows, and belts of planting. 
The farmers here are both induftrious and .'ntelligent ; and, 
indeed, this may be faid now, of the greater part of the far- 
mers in the three Lothians, and in feveral other counties. 
As rents, however, feem to be too high in many places, it is 
to be hoped, from the great number of well informed and 
public fpirited gentlemen in Scotland, that liich leales 
will be granted, not only enabling the farmers to live, 
but to live eafily, to make experiments, to run rifles, and 
confequently to promote knowledge and improvements in 
hafbandry. A contrary courfe, would both effentially en- 
danger

danger agriculture, and the population which depends on iU 
Wc know the happy ftate of the greater part of England, 
where rents are moderate, and the farmers are enjoying in 
fecurity, that plenty and comfort, which are the rewards of 
their labours. Agriculture may be affirmed to be (without 
at all derogating from manufactures and trade) one of the 
moft permanent pillars on which any nation can reft ; and 
they would highly deferve the name of patriots, who (hould 
ftrctch forth a generous hand to cherifh hufljandtncn, pro- 
mote improvements beneficial both to the landlord and to 
the tenant, and enfurc the moft {table and virtuous income 
Tvhich a people can pofTcfs. 

Depopulation and the caufe of it. — From all accounts the pa- 
rifh was formerly much more populous than it is at prelent. 
According to Dr Weblter, the numbers 30 or ye^rs ago, 
were 1 102 ; but as his furvey api)ears in this parUh, and per- 
haps in moll others, to have been confined to examinable per- 
sons cnlv, the whole number of fouls was probably then 
1300 or more. In 1776, the number of louls was 1034; 
in the prelent year 1790, it is only 907. The annual aver- 
age of births lor a century palt, is 33 ; in the former half of 
it from 1 69 1 to 1740, it is 39 ; in the latter from 174J to 
1790, it is only 27. And the dechne (ncedlefs to be Itated) 
has been gradual ; from 1771 to 1780 the number is 25, 
from 1 78 1 to I 790 it is 18. The depopulation appears to 
liave been occafioned folely by one l irge diltrift having been 
turned from tillage into pafture. This tract may confift per- 
haps of I 500 acres, upon which formerly, it is faid, were 
15 or 16 fanners ; at prefent, anu for fome time part, there 
has not been one. Probably the decreafe of inhabitants in 
ieveral other pariflies has been owing very much to a fimilar 
caufe. The union of farms has often been ftated as a caufe 

of 



ef Balmeny, 23^ 

it, 

J, depopulation ; but the fa£l feems very dlfputable. In 
in inany inftances population has been known to increafe, on a 
of great farmer's fucceeding to a number of fmall ones. And 
lit the reafon is plain to thole who make an attentive obferva- 
15 tion. A fmall farmer has feldom any cottagers, his men fer- 
,j vants are unmarried, and lodge in his houfe or offices. The 
(J reverfe is the cafe of a great farmer ; alraoft the whole of 
J, his men fervants have feparate houfes, are married, and have 
^ a numerous and healthy progeny. The number of farmer- 
j families is indeed greater in fmall farms, but the whole po- 
pulation appears in feveral inftances, at leaft, to be lefs. But 
even admitting it to be greater in general, the hufbandry is 
for the moft part bad, puny crops are raifed, men may be more 
numerous, but both men and beafts are almoft in a ftarving 
condition. The recent and excellent practice of ufing two 
horfe ploughs, has alfo been ftated as a caufe of depopula- 
tion, as it reduces the number of hands necefTary to be em- 
^ [ployed ; but befides the expence of culture being thereby 
IclTened, and the value of land confequcntly raifed, it may 
be obferved, that were wafte lands cultivated, and the cul- 
• ture of others carried to the extent, and to the perfeflioa 
which it ought, and which it is to be hoped, will one day be 
the cafe, the numbers of thofe who fubfift by huft)andry, 
would become greater than they have ever yet been. At 
any rate, population is far from depending folely upon agri- 
culture. 

Wages and Expence of Living. — The wages of a day-la- 
bourer are now generally i s., of a carpenter i s. 6d., of a 
mafon i s. 8 d., of a maid-fervant 25 s. the half year, of *a 
!|)loughman between L. 1 2 and L. 1 3 annually, nearly one 
half of which is paid in money, and the other in oat- meal. 
Befides which, ploughmen have generally a free houfe, a lit-

tie garden, carriage of coals and their vldluals in harveft. A 
day-labourer earns between L. 14 and L. 15 yearly; but 
from this the rent of his houfe and garden, which is ordina- 
rily about 15 s, is to be deducted. Their wives are occafion- 
ally employed by the farmers on the fields ; at other times, 
befides earning fomething by fpinning, wafliing, &amp;c. they 
frequently nurfe children which turns to great emolument. 
Their children are alfo at times employed by the farmers. 
In harveft the wages given to the Highlanders who come in 
great numbers to cut down the crop of moft part of Scot- 
land, are perhaps at an average, about 8 d. a day, with their 
vifliuals. The expence of living among the common people, 
is at leaftj no greater in general, than their incomes. How- 
ever numerous their families may be, they feldom receive, 
nor need any aid from the poor's funds. Their food confifls 
of oat meal porridge, oat- cakes and peafe bannoclts, barley- 
broth, with greens, potatoes, butter-milk and water. Some 
begin now to ufe wheaten bread and fmall-beer, but feldom 
any eat bqtcher meat, The luxuries in which they indulge, 
are tea, and what is worfe, whifky. Scarcely any fail to put 
their children to fchool to learn Englifh, writing, and arith- 
metic. In general, fcrvants, labourers, and tradefmen, live 
worfe, and perform le(s labour than in England. But while 
thofe of the fapie cjafs in England have better food and 
more of it, it appears that in fa£l:, they daily eat up their all ; 
and hence when their families are any-wife numerous, re- 
courfe mufl be had to the parilh money. Qn the contrary, 
in Scotland, many half ftarve themfelves, in order to make 
favings ; not ? few lay by feveral pounds Sterling, which 
they referve for old age, for piitting their children to ap- 
prenticefhips, or for otherwife bettering their own condition, 
or that of their famiUes. A fpirit for enterprife and for rif- 
jfig in the world, charaflerifes the Scots in general j and {li^i

has fo remarkably pervaded all ranks for thefe 40 or 50 
years paft, that perhaps no people have in To fliort a period, 
made fo great advances in induftry, agriculture, manufac- 
tures, refinement, public revenue, and private wealth, as the 
people of Scotland. 

Poor. — The funds confift of the rent of poors-lands, in- 
tereft of poors-money, vreekly colleftions, dues of mort- 
cloths, &amp;c. and the hire of a hearfe w^hich was given to 
the parifh by the family of Dundas. The annual income 
from thefe funds, at an average for thefe ten years paft, is 
about L. 41, and the number of the ordinary poor, a- 
bout 25. 

Sihool. — Englifh and writing are taught at is. 6d. the 
quarter : Arithmetic, Latin, and French, at 2 s. 6 d. The 
fchoolmafter's falary,, which confiils both of the parifh falary 
and of the intcreft of a mortification of L. 300, amounts to 
about L. 25 yearly, including the emoluments of the fefiion- 
clerkfhip. The number of fcholars within the parifh is 
from 30 to 40 ; of boarders from 20 to 30, at 20 guineas per 
annum. 

Churchy ^c. — The parifh church, from the ftyle of its 
architedure, which is Saxon, or a mixed fpecies between the 
Greek and Gothic, feeiiis to be 7 or 8 hundred years old. 
It is a very elegant fmall fabric, all of cut ftone, 84 feet long 
by 25 broad, but the breadth diminifhes towards the tri- 
bune, or rounded eaft end. The great door and window* 
have femicircular pediments ornamented with many mould- 
ings, and fnpportcd on the fides by fingle round columns, 
without any diminution. The windows have a very elegant 
Grecian appearance, and were it not for the Gothic capi- 
tals 



Stat'iflical Account 

tals of the columns, and the fhafts being too thick for their 
heighth, the whole might be taken for Greek architecture. 
But the chief beauty of this church is in the infide, which 
ftrikes every fpedtatbr when entering from the weft. About 
one half of the church on the eaft end is covered with vault- 
ed roofs, commencing with a large femicircular arch, and di- 
vided nearly into two equal parts, by ia fmaller arch farther 
eaft. The arches are richly adorned with fucceflive tires of 
mouldings, chiefly in a ftarry Ih'ape : The fmall one has a 
very elegant enrichment introduced into it, confifting of a 
flender reed ftrung at diftances with little cylinders. The 
church of Warthwick in England, near Carlifle, and which 
was built before the times of William the Conqueror, has a 
ftriking rcfemblance to this at Dalmeny, but is far inferior in 
point of embelliftiment. The manfe was built in 1777. The 
ftipend was augmented the fame year, and confifts of 5 bolls of 
wheat; 33 bolls 3 pecks i lippie barley; 9 bolls i peck r lip- 
pie meal; 16 bolls oats; and L. 54 : 17 : 8j| Sterling, amount- 
ing in whole, this prefent year, to about L. 109 Sterling, the 
price of wheat being between 23 and 24 s. ; of barley between 
17 and 18 s. ; of meal between 16 and 17 s.; and of oats be- 
tween 14 and 15 s. the boll. The glebe is between 5 and 6 
acres of good foil. The laft prefentation was given by the 
Earl of Rofebery ; againft which the late Earl of Hopetoun 
protefted, as Vice-Patron, but waved his claim to the exer- 
cife of that right till the next vacancy. 

Muierc'.s. — A coal pit has been recently funk on the Earl 
of Hopetoun's lands of Auldc;^.thy ; but the fuccefs of the trial 
is not yet known. Appearances of coal have alfo lately been 
obferved on Mr Dundas's eflate of Newhalls. There is whin- 
flone rockj and alfo abuadaiice of that fpecies of grey granite 

called 



of Dahiisny. 



t^ti moor-^one *, of which the many excellent roads in this- 
parifti are made. There may be mentioned a fingular bafal- 
tic rock upon the fouth fide of Dundas-hill, 250 yards long» 
and generally aboirt 60 or 70 feet high. This rock is almoft 
perpendicular in its front, and confifts of light blueifli granite, 
of a very clofe and fine texture : The maffes are in an irre- 
gular columnar ftate, fepafated by channels or furrows ; but 
many well defined regular prifms are to be obferved. At the 
foot of the fteep, and alnioft perpendicular bank on which 
this rock lies, is a morafs of about 9 acres of fhell marl. But 
i^bat is chiefly remarkable and valuable as a mineral in this 
p^i^ifli,' is the,, vaft bed of free-ftone upon the fea-cofi. A 
quarry of this excellent ftone has been wrought, to the ex- 
tent of 3 acres, a little to the weft of the borough of Qiieenf- 
ferry ; and, befides fupplying the demands of the neighbour- 
hood, great quantities of it were privately exported for build- 
ing the fortifications and quay of Dunkirk. All the fine 
ftone carvings of Earl Fife's elegant houfe at Banff were exe- 
cuted here upon the fpot, and fent thither in cafes by fea. A 
large baptifinal font, 5 feet in diameter, intended for the Con- 
tinent, with its bottom uppermoft, and covered with fea-weed 
and ftiell fifh, lies oppolite to this quarry a good way within 
the lea mark ; and which the antiquary might fancy to be 
one of the remains of fome Poppifh chi rch once ftanding 
there, that had been overwhelmed by the fea. Grindftones 
are manufaftured at this quarry, and. annually exported to the 
countries on the Baltic. It is faid, that here, and elfewhere 
on the coaft in this parifh, there is fuch a quantity of free- 
ftone, that fcarcely any demand could exhauft it.

* V/hin-ftone, or porphyry (called toad-ftone, rag-ftone, &amp;c. 
in England) differs from moor-ftone in this, that the forme? 
contains iron, and alfo fome lime. 



'SjJ Statijikal Account 

Antiquities. — I. About a mile to the weft of Barnbdugid 
Caftle, on the top of a high fea bank, is an ancient cairn, 
called by the country people the Earl Cairny, of a circular 
fhape, 500 feet in circumference, and 24 high in the middle; 
raifed perhaps for the purpofe of a fepulchral monument. 
The ftones are all fmall, confifting of granite, whin-ftone, 
quartz, iron-ftone, and limc-ftonei and appear to have been 
carried to it by the hand from the neighbouring grounds. A 
portion only of the cairn now remains ; the greater part of 
the ftones having been taken away. 2. In that part of the 
parifti which lies at the weft end of Queensferry, clofe by the 
ihore, are the remains of a monaftery, founded about the 
1330 by one of the lairds of Dundas, for Carmelite Friars. 
The church, a fmall building in a very plain Gothic ftyle, is 
ilill nearly entire. 3. Near a mile to the weft of this, upon 
a high fea bank, where a farm houfe now ftands, there were, 
about 40 or 50 years fince, confiderable ruins of probably an 
old Roman fpeculatonum, confifting of a large carved window, 
a fquare pillar, and a very confiderable quantity of hewn 
i\ones, which, it is faid, were carried to Dunkirk. There 
■were found feveral filver medals of Marcus Antoninus, with 
a Vi&amp;ory on the revcrfe ; alfo, the carved handle of a copper 
veflel, and the bottom of an earthen urn, with the word ad- 
jeBi i the reft obliterated. 

Antient Families y and Eminent Men. — I. The family of 
Dundas of Dundas, from which that of Arnifton, and others, 
are derived, has been traced by genealogifts * back to the 
Saxon Kings of England ; and that family has uninterrupted- 
ly enjoyed a great eftate in this parifti, in the male line, for near 
700 years. The prefent proprietor is the 24th in dcfcent from 

the 



• Sir James Dalf ymplc, Crawford, Niftet, &amp;c. 



oj Balmenf S3f 

the firft laird of Dundas ; and has in his pofleffioii one of the 
oldeft original writings In Scotland, being a charter grante4 
about the year 1 1 20. The (lately caftle of the family, erec- 
ted on a loafty Ctuation, ftill remains, but Is uninhabited. 2. 
The Craigies of Craigy were another antient and confiderablQ 
family ; one of them being a vvitnefs to Dundas's charter juft 
mentioned. After fome generations they terminated in an 
hfiirefs, who, in 1387, married Sir John Stewart, who thence 
took the title of Craigiehall, where their pofterity continued 
till about 1 640, when the eftate of Craigiehall was fold ; but 
the family ftill continue refpeflable in the parifh. 3. The 
Mowbrays of Barnbougle have likewlfe a claim to high anti- 
quity; the name of Philip Mowbray of Barnbougle occurring 
about 1200. In that name (of which were feveral Dukes of 
Norfolk, Earjs of Nottingham, &amp;c.) the eftate remained till 
the 1620, when Sir Robert Mowbray fold it; whofe repre- 
fentatlve, it is faid, is (iill in the parifh, but reduced to the 
condition of a common fervant, Barnbougle Caftle ftill re- 
mains, and is inhabited, but is no ways remarkable, except for 
its fanciful fituatlon within the fea mark, and for its embra- 
sures prefenting a ftrong front to the fea. 4. The late Wil- 
liam Wilkie, D. D. born in the village of Echlln in this parlfli, 
Oft. 5. 1721, and educated at the fchool of Dalmeny. After 
revolving the hiftory of antient families in this and other pa- 
rifties, many of which have fallen into decline, and may per- 
haps pafs into oblivion, it may be obferved, that the memo- 
ry of a man of genius and learning is lefs fubjedl to perilh. 
The Epigomad will protjably be always admired. Without 
fpeaking of the happy choice of the fubjeft, and of the merit 
pf many of the charaflers in that Epic poem, it may be 
enough to fay, that the epifode of Hercules, taken by itfelf, 
is fulEcient to entitle the poet to perpetual fame. Dr Wilkie 
was diftinguiflvsd for a Angular compafs of knowledge, and 

chiefly

chiefly for an originality of genius. In his youth he culti- 
vated a fmall farm, and ftruggled long and hard with penu- 
ry. He was afterwards minifter of Ratho ; and laflly profef- 
for of Natural Philofophy in the Univerfity of St Andrews, 
where he died in 1773, in his 52d.year.

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7563326">SORBIEc</name>
By the Rev. Dr Isaac Davidson.</head> 
<p>


Situation, Soil, ^c. 

TH E parlfh of Sorbie, in the fhlre and prefbytery of 
Wigton, and fynod of Galloway, is bounded by Wig- 
ton Bay and Solway Firth on the eaft ; by the pariOi of 
Whitehorn cn the fouth ; by the fame paridi and that of 
Glaflerton on the weft ; and by Kirkinnci- on the north. 

From the fouth, where it joins Whitehorn, it ftretches fix 
miles northward to Kirkinner ; and from the ealt, on Wigton 
Bay, it runs as ftr to the weft, where it unites v/lth the parifli' 
of GlafTerton. This is its broadeft part. From Garlreftow'rr'. 
Bay on the eaft, to the neareft part of Whitehorn pari(h due 
weft, is about a mile and a furlong. This is its narroweft 
part. 

Vefiels fail from Garlieftown to Whitehaven in four 
hours, to the Ifls of Man in three, to Liverpool in twentj- 
four, to Dublin in twenty-four, and to Port GrefMock in 
thirty. 

The face of the country is beautiful, being variegated with 
little hills and fertile plains. In their fcalbns, the :,chcfi: 
herbage, and the moft luxuriant crops of grain, every lere 
appear. Through the whole year, there is a delightt . cr- 
dure, leffened, but feidom altogether deftroyed, either b/ 

froft 



Froft or fnow. In the year 1775, when the whole ifland of 
Great Britain was almoft buried in fnow, this parilh prefent- 
:d the eye with its favourite colour j and green fields and 
bappy flocks were pleafing objefts to the traveller, and enriched 
:heir owners. The foil is not deep, but exceeding fine, yield- 
ing an iiicreafe equal to Hertfordlhire. 

To the care and fuperior ikili of the prefent Earl of Gal- 
oway, the fertility and beauty of this parifh are in a great 
iieafure to be alcribed. His Lordfliip lives in it fcveral 
iionths every year, and has fhewn much attention to agricul- 
ure, breeding of cattle, and planting. When he came to the 
pofTefllon of his antient and exteniive family cftatc in the year 
1765, this parifh, like the country in general, was almoft in 
1 ftate of nature. There were few inclofures ; the roads 
Lvere narrow and unformed ; and fcarce a tree appeared to 
oleafe the eye. Things are new totally different. The fields 
ire all inclofed, and well cultivated. The roads are of the 
Droper breadth, well formed, and made of good niaierials ; 
md plantations every where prefent themfeives. 

Galloway Houfe was built by the late Earl, and forms part 
3f a landfcape truly beautiful and grand, Garlieftown Bay is 
DO the north ; and Rigg) or Hunter's Bay, is on the fouth of 
it. From its windows are feen the richeft fif^lds ; an indent- 
ed coaft, adorned with growing improvements ; a clufter of 
ifles, and the lofty mountains of .Cumberland and Man, appear- 
ing at a proper diftance. The prefent Earl has made great 
additions and improvements.. The principal rooms are fpa- 
cious, and the library Is ilored v/ith nriany thoufand valuable 
volumes. 

Lord Galloway's managennent of his eftate deferves parti- 
cular notice. The lands about Galloway Houfe are well 
divided, and the fields are completely fheltered by the plan* 
t^iojis^ which produces many advantages. The grafs fprings

early*, and the cattle, defended from the ftorm, feed at their 
eafei The behs of planting, being carried along the ridges 
of the hills, improve the appearance of the country, and give 
warmth to all below them. 

The Earl has ftudied the nature of forefl: trees, and the 
different ways of raifing and treating them, with much atten- 
tion. Under his care trees grow on every expofure ; and e- 
very fpecies of them thrive as well about Galloway Houfe as 
in any part of England. The pine-after, or maritime pine, 
is of fo much ufe here, and indeed in fuch places as are 
much expofed, as to deferve the greateft' attention. It is 
hardy, and makes vigorous fhoots, almoft on the fea-beach ; 
and is an excellent defence for other trees. The proper me- 
thod of raifing tJiis moll uieful plant in the nurfery infures 
its fuccefs. The feed ought to be fown on rich ground, in 
the month of March. Sixteen months afterward, the plant 
ought to be taken up in moift weather ; its tap root (horten- 
ed, and the young tree phnted in a rich ground well pulve- 
rized. It mufl: be watered for ten or twelve days, till the 
new roots begin to ftrike. Thus iranfplanted, it muft ftand 
for eighteen or tiventy-four months, and then planted out 
on any expofure. Tranfplancing and cutting them, as 
above defcribed, make them put out many lateral roots, 
which find food for the plant, and give it firmnefs in its 
ftation. "Whereas, if it is permitted to remain two years in

refifting the ftorm. Gentlemen, therefore, who plant near 
the fliore, ought to give the maritime pine as much foil as 
pofiibie, and raife a defence for it in its infant ftate. Its 
future fervice to them, and their pofterity, will amply repay 
their care and expence.

te proper to obferve, that refinous plants have two feaK os 
of growth ; the firft in the fpring, and the fecond after the 
early harveft rains. Early planting is confequently advanta- 
geous. All trees planted here before new year's day thrive 
beft, excepting fuch as are intended for wet ground, which 
ought to be planted in the month of March. The oak, aOi, 
beech, alder, firs *, &amp;c. thrive here, and are equal to any in 
their quality. Lord-fGalloway has found that pruning makes 
them grow with great vigour. By experiment it appears, that 
plants which were pruned, advanced, at the rate of four years 
in fix, before thofe which were not pruned. This treatment 
befl: fuits trees which have been taken from the nurfery, and 
fhould be attended to in the winter of the fecond or third 
year after they have been planted out. In the plantations of 
a circumference of fixteen miles, trees of every kind grow 
with the greateft luxuriance ; and fome of them have rifen^ 
in a few years, to the height of fifty feet. His Lord/hip's de- 
ligns are great ; and he is accompl fhing them, by planting, 
at the rate of 200,000 trees every year. 

Lahsy l2fc. — There is a very fine frefli water lake on the 
north- weft border of the parifh, above three miles in circum- 
ference, well ftored with perch, pike, and eels. It is called 
Dowalton Lake, becaufe a great family of the name of 
M'Dowal were proprietors of it, and their place of refidence 
or town was near it. The lake furrounds the remains of a 
lioufe and garden; The houfe, it is fuppofed, was fortified, 
and afforded a fafe retreat to its Lords, when feudal and al- 
lodial rights produced difcord and war. The filh in it are 
never caught for fale. From this lake a rivulet fl.ows, through 
a rich valley, to Garlieftown Bay.

Sea Coafl, Fijhy Tides, C3'r. — There are upwards of twelve 
miles of fea-coaft, including the bays. The fliore is rather 
bold to the fouth, but becomes flat at Rigg or Hunter's Bay j 
and continues fo to Garlieftown, where it rifes again. On' 
the whole, it may be called a rocky fliore, though in Garlief- 
town Bay there is a deep, foft clay, on which veflels lie in the 
greateft fafctyj and have the beft anchorage. Flounders, 
foles, fl:ate, cod, crabs, iobfters, oyfters, with many other 
kinds of fiPx), abound on the coart. Herr;ngs were found fome 
time ago in vaft fhoals ; and there is reafon to believe that 
they ftill vifit this fhore. Some years ago they were caught 
with great fuccefs ; and it appears from a minute of kirk- 
feflion, dated September i. 1700. that the inhabitants were 
fo anxious in the purfui: of th:;;i as to be difficultly reftrain- 
ed from fifliing on the Lord's day, ihe people are now fully 
engaged in agriculture : Fiihing is nearly neglefted, and 
the fifhing boats on the coaft are very few. The fea-animals 
are the fame with thofe on the eaftern coaft of Great Britain. 
The fea-weeds are of the common kind. A few tons of kelp 
are made from them every two or three years. Some are 
fpread upon the land, without any preparation ; but the 
belt farmers ufe th-em in compofts, which produce a quick 
and ftrong fermentation. The courfes of the tides are as 
follow. 1 he tide flows firaight out from "Wigton Bay fix 
hours, and takes the fame time to return. At Garlieftown, 
ihe tide flows five hours froiii the fouth, and ebbs feven._ It 
Is high water at Garhcltown at a quarter of an hour before 
eleven o'clock A.M. at the change and full of the moon. 
Theie are no light houfes, beacons, or artificial land-marks, 
jon the coaft; but there are feveral places where light- 
houfes might be erected with great advantage to navigation. 

The head-lands are Crugleton and Eagernefs j and the 

principal 



oj Sorbie, 24^ 

principal bays are thofe of Garlieftown ; Rlgg, now called 
Hunter's Bay, in compliment to Captain Hunter of the na- 
vy, who came to an anchor in it, with Lord Garlies on board ; 
and Ports Allan, Whaple, and Innerwelt. Many other fmalU 
er bays indent the coaft in a moft beautiful manner, where 
veflels, loaded with lime and fea-fliells, dehver their cargoes. 

Garlieflown is wSll fituated for a harbour, not only to 
ferve its own neighbourhood, but all the trade of the weft 
of England, from Liverpool to Carlifle ; that of the weft of 
Scotland to Wales and trigland ; and that of Ireland and 
IVIan. But no trade would profit fo much by it as that large 
and important one from Whitehaven to Dublin. This great 
trade, to which one tide is of vaft confequence, is confl- 
derably retarded by the fouth, fouth-wcft, and weft winds, 
which are more frequent there than any other. Were there 
a good harbour at Garlieftown, the fhips bound froni White- 
haven to Dublin might come over to it with fouth and fouth- 
weft winds, and deliver their cargoes much fboner than they 
do at prefent. To this deflrable end the tides are particu=- 
larly favourable. 

Cattle, Wool, ^c. — The black cattle of this parifh and 
neighbourhood arc of the befr qi'ality. Lord Galloway thinks 
lie has improved the fize and iliape of the original breed, by 
introducing Weftmorland b'liis. His Lordlhip gave nevr 
life to a fpirit of emulation among the breeders, by a pre- 
mium of a very handiom^; lilver cup, which he beftowed eve- 
ry year on the perlon wiio produced the beft four year olii 
ox or cow. With rc.pedt to Galloway cattle in gene-

This county fends many thoufands to thefe markets every 
year ; and this parifti breeds annually between five and fix 
hundred. They are about twenty eight days in travelling to 
the Norfolk markets, arid coft about 1 8 s. per head driving 
and feeduig. When they have finifhed their journey, it is 
fuppofed they have loft, through fatigue, above one-eight of 
their weight. To this add the lofles occafioned by difeafe^, 
by frights, heats, bad water, lamenefs, and other caules. Such 
lofles afFe£t not only the proprietors of droves, but aifo the 
public, by advancing the price of beef. Here the unfriendly 
operation of the falt-laws appears in a very clear light. Were 
it not for them, the vaft herds of cattle produced by this iruly 
fertile country might be flaughtered and falted at home for

Some of the moft antient breed of Galloway horfes are a- 
mong the (uountutns and kfs improved parts of the country. 
They are laid to oe very hardy, eahly maintained, and high 
fpir.ted. This breed is well attended to in Cumberland, 
where it is much improve.d by crofTes with Englifh horfes. A 
larger breed is preferred here, as being more fit for the pur- 
poies of draught and agriculture. Through the attention of 
the noblemen and gen ry, this neighbourhood has a breed of 
horfes fit for the laddie, and carriages of every kind. The 
colours of horfes are various ; but the dark bay, with black 
legs and feet, is preferred. Their fhape is generally good. 
They were originally galloways, and faid to have fprung 
from a Spanifli breed, which came afhore on this coaft when 
one of the veffels of the Armada was wrecked upon it, after 
failing round by the Pentland Firth.

Agriculture, id'c, — ^The general rule of farming is, to have 
one-third of the land in tillage, and two-thirds in pafture. 
Oats, barley, and peafe, are the grains generally raifed. Po- 
tatoes have been long cultivated with much fuccefs. Wheat 
has not fucceeded, unlefs with a few, though the foil is very 
like that of Hertfordfhire. The parifla does not only fupply 
itfelf, but exports a large quantity of grain and potatoes to 
London, Liverpool, Dublin, the Ifle of Man, and the Weft 
of Scotland. Every field having produced its number of 
crops, is laid down with red, white, or yellow clovers, rib, or 
rye grafs feeds. The feed time commences in the beginning 
of March, and the harvefl about the middle of Auguft. 

There 



of Sorhie* 25 1 

There Is marie in the parifli. Lime, from Cumberland, is 
delivered in the different bays at is. the Carlifle bufhel, 
■which is equal to three Winchefter bufhels ; and lea (hells at 
I s. 6 d. per ton. Sea fliells are the beft of all manures ; and 
in this neighbourhood they are inexhauftible. Every tide, 
accompanied by an call: wind, brings in great quannties of this 
moft valuable commodity. With thefe different manures, 
rich crops and fine cattle are raifed ; but, if the prel'eilr treat- 
menr of a moft generous foil be perfifted in, there is reaibn 
to believe that it will be much injured. Ihree, and Ibme- 
times four crops of oats, or barley, fucceed each other ; and 
with the laft of thefe crops grafs leeds are fown, which are 
cut for hay in the following year. Thus four, and fome- 
times five, whue crops follow one another ; for a crop of rye 
grafs is as levere as a crop of oats^ and therefore may be called 
a white crop. 

When the land is laid down with grafs feeds, it common- 
ly lies fix years. Failowingj in this part of the country, is 
little pradiled ; and green crops are but fmall, and few in 
number ; the fields, therefore, become very dirty. A partial 
fallow in the ipring, and early in May, is of great uie in 
cleaning the fields. It is often followed by a rich crop of 
light grain ; and is particularly ferviceable in preparing land 
for grafs. This is almoft the only fallow ufed here. 

Carts are ufed in carrying merchants goods, manures, 
grain, &amp;c. &amp;c. The fmall plough is ufed, fometimes with, 
and fometimes without a chain ; but for coarfe ftrong land, 
a large plough is thought neceffary.

is the only refident one. Dr Davidfon, and EUiot William 
Davidlon, his only fon, are the prefent minifters. The for-- 
mer was admitted November 1775 ; the latter was ordained, 
September 3. 1789, afTiftant and I'ucceffbr. The King is pa- 
tron. 

Poor. — There are 13 poor on the lifl:. About L. 27 Ster- 
ling per annum is diftributed among them, chiefly raifed by 
collections ia the church. The legal manner of treating pau- 
pers was adopted here anno 1776; that- is, they were obliged 
to ufe badges, and to confine themlelves within the bounds 
of the parifh. This dillinftion was very dif.igreeable to them; 
and it was found that iome of them had hoarded up money. 
The prefent incumbent has never had an improper applica- 
tion from a native for admlflion to the public charity.

three quarters i s. ; carpenters i s. 4 d. ; mafons is. 6 d. ;

A farm fervant, when married, has a houfe and garden, z 
cow's grafs and fodder, ground to raife flax and potatoes for 
his family, his peats led home, and oats out of the barn, to 
the value of L 8 Sterlmg. Labourers who threOi the grain 
receive the 25th part for their Jabour. They are employed 
in other work wnen the threfiimg is over, for whicn they 
receive an hou(e and ganlen, grafs and fodder for a cow,, 
ground for potatoes, Jfnd flax and oats out of the barn, to 
the value of L. 2 Sterhng. 

Both thefe delcriptions of labourers maintain their families 
comfortably, educate their children in reading, writing, and 
arithaietic, and fometimes put them apprentices to mechanics. 

Domeftic fervants are hired at and under the following 
rates, very feldom above them : Men at L. 7 Sterling; wo- 
men L. 3. 

Peat is the fuel commonly ufed ; they are fold at 3 d. the 
horfe loid at the mofles; and, when carried home to the con- 
i4imer, they are generally dnuble that fum. This kind of 
fuel is commonly procured in the pariili of Kirkinner. Coals 
are brought from Cumberland at 19 s. the ton. The fcarci- 
ty of fuel is the greatell difadvantage under which this neigh- 
bourhood labours, and yet it is within four hours failing 
from the Engiifh coal mines. The tax upon that necelTary 
article, when water borne, is the caufe of its high price ; and 
here that tax 's a real grievance. Its bad elfc6ts, and un- 
friendly influence on njanufnilures, are evident. A imall 
duty, raifed at the pit, would affcft every confumer equ.illy, 
and be more produflive O ;r legiflators will furely embrace 
fome fit opportunity of reviling the coal and fait laws : And, 
it is humbly hoped that the honourable member to whom

Mifcellaneous Obfervntions, Antiquiti'ei^ ^c. — There are two 
villages in this parifh, Garlieftown, founded by the prefent 
Eaii of Galloway when Lord Garlics. It is in the form of a 
crefcent. It contains about 450 inhabitants. The other vil- 
lage IS horbie, alfo begun through the encouragement of the 
preient iiarl, in which there are about 80 inhabitants. 

A tumulus, was opened in part by fome road makers, 
and human bones were found in it. Near it, and dole by- 
Hunters, or Rigg Bay, were alfo found human bones, inclo- 
fed by three ftones ; and upon one of the ftones there feem- 
ed to be an infcription. There are the remains of two caf. 
ties, Crugleton and Eagernefs. An unornamented arch, and 
fome other parts of the ruins of Crugleton, fhew it to have 
been a place of great fize and ftrength. The foffe remains 
very plain. This caflle is laid to have been the dwelling of 
the very ancient and wealthy family of the Vaufes, now Van- 
fes, of Barnbarrow. Crugleton is now the property of Sir 
Stair Agnew of Lochnaw, Bart. Eagerneis is altogether de- 
ftroyed. 1 he terminations of the names of thefe cailles fhew 
them to be of Saxon original. Nefs, in that language, figni- 
fles an headland, or promontory ton is derived from a word 
in the fame language which fignifies an hedge or wall ; and 
that word, again, feems to be from one Cgnifying a hill. Ea- 
gernefs is a headland : Crugleton is upon a hill ; and feems 
to fignify a town upon a hill, furrounded by a wall. There 
is a rope walk at Garliellown, well condu61:ed ; and ten coafl- 
ing veiTels belong to that port.

this parilh To receive charity from the panfli funds is 
efteeined difgraceful, and therefore frugality prevails Their 
induftry is perfevering, and fecures their contentment and 
virtue. There has not been one criminal profecution carried 
on againft any of them within the memory of any perfon in 
the parifh. ^ 

Two large velTels were ftranded on this coafl: a few years 
ago ; every poffible civility was fhewn to the people ; and 
their veiTels were got off again without being damaged. 

The ftatute labour iacommuted ; and, by act of parliament, 
the roads are made, and kept in repair, by a pound rate. In 
the year 1782, a plentiful harveft was reaped In perftiR:ion. 
There were no complaints among the poor ; nor was there 
any meal fold under the market price. The landholders and 
farmers had a friendly interview, and refolved to retain in the 
country as much grain as was fufficient to fupply the inhabi- 
tants. 

The manners, drefs, and ftyle of living of the people, are 
all much changed withm the lafl: 50 years. Before that pe- 
riod, they knew little of the happy effects of indullry, and, 
therefore, lived upon meal, milk, and vegetables. Their 
drefs and houfes were very mean. They knew not the va- 
lue of the inexhauftible fhores of natural manures, marie, and 
fea (hells, which were at hand, trufting to the folding of 
their herds for manuring their lands. Now every thing bears

There are three fchools In the parifii and all the young 
people are educated according to their ftations. There is 
one inn in Garlieftown, equal to any in this part of Scotlantl, 
and five ale, or rather whiflvy-houfes. In the village of 
Sorbie there is one houfe in which foreign fpirits are fold, 
and another in which there is nothing but whi&amp;y. There 
is very little ale fold or brewed in this parifh of late 
years. The effcfts of public houfes are moft injurious to 
the morals and induftry of the people, efpecialiy when 
little elfe than whifl^y is fold in them. A few pence pro- 
cures as muclx of this bafe fpirit as is fuflicient to make 
any man mad. The landlords of fuperfluous petty public 
houies, generally wafte their time, and ruin their confiitu-

and FoJJci ry on the weft-, and by Cromarty Bay on'the fouth. 
The iiighland diftridt of this parifti is, for the moft part, 
wild and uncultivated, confifting of high mountains, feparat- 
ed from each other by rapid rivulets, and extenfive tracts of 
moors and molTy ground. In this diftrltJ}^, there is a conii- 
derable ftrath *, called the Clare, pleafantly fituated in an in- 
clined plain, upon the banks of the river Jjkiack, containing 
about 200 acres arable land and mepdow ground. And, on 
the oppofite fide of the river, there is alfo a plain of about 30 
acres, called Bognahavin. Though the houfes in this remote 
diftri£t are in general very mean, yet there is one on each fide 
of the river bulk in a llyle fuperior to the generality of 
farm-houles in the parifli, being the goat-vvhey quarters of 
the uiinifter of Kiltearn, and of Mr Munro flierifF-fubftitute 
of Lewii. In either of theie houfes, the weary traveller, or 
the fatii,ued fportJman, can find comfortable accommoda- 
tions^ This circumftance is only taken noticeof, becaufe it is a 
perfedl contraft to the miferable huts, called Shealings, whicii 
the hardy Highlanders inhabit while they tend their flocks 
and herds, and live on the produce of the dairy.

very rich and beautiful profpedl opens to our view ; viz* 
Vrell cultivated fields, incloled either with ftone-walls, or 
•with thorn hedges and belts of planting. In ftiort, every tra- 
veller is ftruck with the natural beauty of the couritry, which 
of late years has been fo much improved by art, as muft give 
a favourable idea of the good tafte and opulence of the pro- 
prietors. The gentlemen's houfes are large and commodi- 
ous, and their gardens well ftored with fruit-trees. About 
eighty years ago, there were few foreft trees to be li:en here,- 
except fome natural alders and willows on the banks of 
rivers, and a few alhes, elms, and limes, furrounding gentle- 
men's gardens ; but now there are extenfive plantations of 
pines or firs, feveral miles in circumference, bcfides many 
thoufands of oaks, and other hard wood of every kind that ia 
to be met with in North Britaiin. The feveral proprietors 
feem to vie with each other in raifing the fineft plantatioas 
of timber. Such improvements are defirable on a double 
account ; They adorn the face of the country, while they 
promote the intcreft of individuals. 

There are feveral hills in this parifh, which, being viewed 
from the plains below, add much to the grandeur and variety 
of the profpeO. Several of thefe hills are covered with i\v 
plantations, which cannot fail to pleal'e the eye, as, the 
hill above Foulis, the " hill of Swordle, and fome others. 
Knockmartin, a fmall hill, compared to the reft, is fituatecf 
on the eaft fide of the hill of Sv^'ordle, and is feen from the 
lea fide. Its chief beauty coni'ifts in its fhape, it tapers gra- 
dually from the bafe to the higheft point, forming a cone. 
This lall mentioned^ as well as the higher hills beyond it, are 
covered with heath. But the moft dirtinguiOied hill in the 
parilh is Ben-uaifli, which towers above all the reft ; and 
muft be extremely highj, as it is feeu in Mc-. ay an.d BanfF-

fhire. Ben-uaifh Is always covered with fnow; even in tTid 
hotteft day in fummer. 'And, in allufion to this, there is 
a remarkable claufe inferted in one of the charters of the fa- 
mily of Fowlis, which is, that the foreft of Uaifn is held of 
the King on condition of paying a fnow-ball to his Majefty 
on any day of the year, if required. And we are affured 
that a quantity of fnow was aftually fent to the Duke of 
Cumberland, when at Invernefs, in 1 746, to cool his wine. 
There is a great deal of heath and coarfe grafs, which is 
excellent pafture for cattle, all around this hill ; and the fo» 
reft is well flocked with deer, and a variety of moor 
game. 

Alt') Clinjatey and Difeafes. — ^I'he air is generally clear and 
|)ure ; and it has been obfcrved, in this, as well as the neigh- 
bouring parifhes, that the weather has been more changeable 
for twenty years paft than in former times. That rain haa 
fallen of late years in a greater proportion than it did for- 
merly, is a well known faO, which has materially injured 
the crops, and occafioncd late harvefts over all the north 
of Scotland, And, that the air is more cold and moift upon 
the higher, than upon the lower ground, is found to hold 
true, in this diftrift, as well as in other corners of the king-* 
dom. But, notwithftanding the variablenefs of the weather^ 
the climate of Kiltearn is by no means unhealthful j nor can 
the inhabitants impute the difeafes they fometimes labour 
under to any noxious quality in the air, but rather to acci- 
dental caufes. We are credibly informed, that the fcarcity 
of bread in 1782 has impaired the conftitutions of feveral 
people in the lower ranks of life, and entailed obftinate dif- 
eafes on them. When an infedlious fever attacks any family 
in the parilh, it is generally communicated to fome of their 
ceighboursj^an'.! makes feveral breaches before it ceafes ; but 

it

5t is a providential circumftance, that the people are feldotn 
vifited with fuch a calamity. The epidemical difeafe moft 
(dreaded is the natural fmall-pox, which ufually fweeps away 
'a number of children once in feven years, and fometimcs 
oftener. In the year 1777, above 30, and in 1778 no fewer 
than 47 children died of this difeafe. There is not the leafi: 
doabt that this great tinortality was owing in part to the 
improper treatment of the patients, and the negle^^ of ino- 
culation, to which the people are ftili averfe, in fpite of 
the earnell: perfLiafion and example of their fuperiors, con- 
firnied by a fuccefsful practice in almoft every inftance where 
it has been attempted. Rheumatic complaints have alfo been 
more frequent tlia:i formerly wjthin thele 30 years, owing 
probably to the fubftltution of linen for flannel fhirts among 
xWz lower ranks ; and a rcturu to the ufe of flannel and 
woolen is found to be the moil: e^cacious remedy for this 
pomplainr. 

Before v/e conclude this article, it may be proper to ob- 
fervc, that the following inllances of longevity, which fecm 
to be well attefted, afford a very favourable teftimony of the 
healthfulnefs of the air and climate of this parifii. About 
the year 1706, Katharine M'Kenzie died at Fowlis in the 
J 1 7th year of her age. In 1782, Mr John Brown, late 
factor of Fouiis, died in his 107th year. In 1775, Kenneth 
Munro, late of Inveran, died in this parifli, in his looth 
vear ; and iNIrs Munro, his wife, died 4 [years after him, 
in her 88tli year. The only inftance v.'hich we fhall add is 
a gentleman, a heritor pf the parifli, who had been a member 
of the laft Scotch, and of the lirft Britiih, parliament ; he 
died about 30 years ago, in his 94th year. And, within thefe 
few years, a fifter and daughter of the fame gentleman died 
lierc, vho were very little fliort of the fame age. 

Soil 



464 Statl/lical Account 

Soil aitd Produce. — ^The foil here is various, as might be 
cxpeded in fo large a diftrift of land. In the highland dif- 
tri£b, the foil is either molTy, or a cold clay, mixed with fand 
or gravel, very unfriendly to vegetation. On the banks of 
the rivers the meadows are covered with a tough, ftrong turf, 
producing a coarfe fort of grafs, fitter for pafturing young 
cattle than for fattening them, or producing milk. And it 
would probably be for the intereft, both of landlord and te- 
nant, that a plough were never ufed in this diflrift ; for, tho* 
corn may grow, yet, through the cold and moifture of the 
climate, it feldom ripens fo as to make good bread. In the 
iow diflrii!!: of the parifli, again, the difference of foil is very 
obfervable. Towards the eaft, it is light and gravelly. In 
«he middle, for about two miles fquare, there is a rich loam, 
iit to produce any vegetable, with proper culture. As we 
proceed further on, the foil is black and fpongy ; but, by 
means of drains, it has of late years been greatly improved. 
The weftern divifion of the parifh confifts chiefly of a ftrong 
day foil, fome of it of a reddifli hue, which, when well 
wrought, produces excellent crops. The feafons for fowing 
vmd reaping, in this parifli, are as different as the degrees of 
aftivity, and the unaccountable prejudices of various farmers. 
Some lay it down as a maxim, never to begin fowing tijl a 
certain day of the month, when their fathers and grandfa- 
thers were accuftomed to fow. Others, again, embrace the 
firft opportunity, when the foil is fufficiently dry to receive 
the feed ; and the elFeft is fuch as might naturally bje expedl- 
«d. The fpirited a£tire farmer, who fows early, reaps an 
early liarveft, and the beft corn ; while the others fuffer all 
the inconveniences ot a late harveft. But, we muft here re- 
mark, what is very obfervable, that the farmers on the oppo- 
il-te fide of the bay, in what is called the Black Ifle, never fail 
to reap their corn a fortnight or twenty days earlier than the 

inliabitantg 



&amp;f Kilteam. 365 

Inhabitants of this parifli j and yet they are expofed to the 
north, while Kiltearn has a fouth afpeft. The difference muft 
Certainly be owing to the quality of the foil. That on the 
oppofite fliore is a mould mixed with fand and gravel, chiefly 
founded on quarry. As to the produdlions of this parifli, 
were we to mention them all, we would enumerate the feve- 
ral animals and vegetables that are moft commonly to be met 
with in North Britain, with the atldiiion of thofe produc- 
tions peculiar to highland countries. The hills abound with 
red deer, and all kinds of moor game ; and various birds and 
beafls of prey, as eagles, hawks, foxes, &amp;c; In the extenfive 
heaths of this diftri^, a great variety of berries is produced, 
moft of which are very grateful to the tafte. During the 
winter ftorms, there are fhoals of fea-fowls on the coaft here, 
fuch as wild dufts, and a fpecies of geefe called rood geefe^ 
which are efteemed good eatmg. Some fliell fifli are likewife 
found upon the coaft, fuch as mulcles, cockles, and wilks. 
The fea-coall being fmooth and fandy for the moft part, 
there is little fea-weed, and none at all fit for burning kelp. 
Bee-hives were formerly very plentiful in this parifh, but now 
it is probable that there are not above 20 in the whole diftridt. 
The parifh ufed to be greatly infefted with rats ; but they 
are now almoft extirpated. Whether this is owing to the 
induftry of rat-killers, who have been employed to dcftroy 
them, or whether they have emigrated to feme other dif- 
t'rift, is not known. As the prejudice againft eating fwine's 
flefli is in a great meafure overcome, a confiderable number 
of pigs is reared here. Not only every farmer, but every 
houfe- keeper, rears annually one or two pigs, and fome half 
a dozen ; the greateft number of which are fold at the neigh- 
bouring markets ; and, when tolerably well fed, fetch from 
20 to 30 (hillings a piece. The breed of black cattle here is 
various. In the Highlands, they were fmall fazed and hardy, 
Vol. I. LI but 



StaitjTical Accottnt 



but not quite fo fmall as jhe common breed of cattle in covit^ 
ties farther to the north. But the gentlemen and principal' 
farmers have been at great pains to improve their breed of 
cattle by purchafing fome from Fife and Moray, which are 
confiderably larger than the common breed of the dototry. 
Some of the lafi mentioned, when full fed, fell- for L/TO or 
L. 12. The horfes of the parifh are aifo of two kinds; 
fome of a large Gallo»yay fize, wlijch the gentlemen ufe in" 
ploughing and c:irting, value froni L. lo to L. 20 each; 
and a few v/orth L. 25. But the greatefl: number of horfes 
are what are commonly called Highland Garro/is^ value from 
L. 3 to L. 5 each. There are few goats in the parifh ; and 
thefe are the property of two tenants, who occupy very re- 
mote poflcilions. The number of fheep at prefent is very 
inconfiderable, and, for the moft part, of a very inferior qua- 
lity, being of a fmall fize, and producing very little wool. At 
prefent, there are only two or three farmers in the parifh 
who manage their fheep properly ; and one of their Iheep is 
worth two of any other farmer's. The rearing of Iheep has 
been rather difcouraged for fome time paft, being found i'o 
deftrudfive to young plantations of timber ; but it is not' 
doubted that, in a few years, the rearing of this ufeful animal 
will become a principul ohjeft both with tlie landlords and te- 
nants, 

Wc fnall conclude this article, by giving a lift of the nam- ' 
ber of horles, black cattle, and llieep, in the parilli, which, 
according to the bel^ information, cannot be far diftant froiu 
the truth.

inhfihitaiTis ; thdr Ongin, atid Prcgrefs In Civilization.— It is 
well known, that in many parts of Scotland, particularly ia 
the north, every diftria is inhabited chiefly by ibme one par- 
.ticular tribe or clan. So it is in tliis country. The name of 
Rofs prevails in the eaft, Mackenzie in the welt, and Miinro 
in the middle diftridl ; i. in the two contiguous parilhes of 
Kiltearn and Alnes, which diftricl of country is commonly 
,cz\\cd Fiirindonald ; which name appears to be of very an- 
,tient date.- Buchanan relates, that, about the beginning of 
the 1 ith centm-y, King Malcolm If. of Scotland fued out 
the lands in the coantry to the great families in it, on account 
of their eminent fervices in aflilVing him to extirpate the 
Danes out of his kingdom. And, according to tradition, it 
was on that occsfion that the country between the borough 
of Dingwall and the water of Alr.es, in the fhire of Rofs, 
was given to Donald Munro., the progenitor of the family of 
Towlis, from which all the Ivlunros in this c^ountry are de- 
fcended : And part of thefe lands were afterwards by the 
King erefted into a barony, called the Barony of Foiulis. From 
this Donald Munro is lineally deicended the preient Sir Hugh 
Munro, Bart, who is the 2yth baron of Fovylis, and proprie- 
:tor of about two-thirds of the lands in the parilh of Kilrearn. 
Under this head, we may obfcrve^ that, in antient times, 
thofe tribes or clans who inhabited different diftrlffs of the 
country,, looked upon themfelves as a diliintS: people or na- 
tion, united together under their refpe£live chiefs or leaders, 
who exercifed a -fovereign, and at the fame time a parental, 
authority over them. They looked up to the chief as to their 
common father ; he looked upon them as his children, v/honi 
b« protedled as well as governed. That there were ccnftant 
•feuds and conflifts maintained between the neighbouring clans 
or tribes, is a faft well known. Many circumftances concur- 
red to occafion thefe conflicts, nnd to fupport this warlike 



Siatiftical Account 



fpirlt. In thofe rude and remote ages, when trade snd com«. 
mercc were little attended to, men of an entcrprifing fpirit 
had no other field for dillinguilhing themfelves but by their 
fuperior fkiU in the ufe of arms. This induced them to watch 
for every opportunity of difplaying their martial atchieve- 
ments ; and hence it often happened, that the flighteft af- 
fronts were refented as the greateft injuries, efpecially from 
one of a different tribe or clan. And it was not uncommon, 
for the fake of a meer pundlilio, or point of honour, to fee 
two neighbouring clans marching out to battle, and main- 
taining the bloody conflict till vidory was declared on one 
fidel The confli(St being over, it was ufual that the chief or 
leader beftowed fome mark of favour upon thofe of his fol- 
lowers who had diftinguilhed themfelves by their valour. 
When both (ides were wearied out with the fatigues of war, 
there was ufually a bond of amity or friendftiip entered into 
by their leaders, in which they bound themfelves, and their 
followers, to maintain peace} which deeds were executed, 
■with all the folemnity of treaties entered into between two 
fovereign powers. But, even after the chiefs of the clans 
became more enlightened and humanifed than to encourage 
the old feuds, they found it no eafy matter to reftrain the 
lower ranks among their followers from affaflinating their 
neighbours, and committing depredations on their property. 
A ftritcing proof of which we learn from a tranfaction that 
happened in this part of the country little more than a cen- 
tury ago, when there was a bond of friendftiip entered into 
between the families of rfeaforth and Fowlis, An old record, 
which gives a charadter of Sir John Munro of Fowlis, fpeaks 
thus: * He lived in good correfpondence with his neigh- 
» hours ; for there was a mutual condefcendence part hc- 
« twixt Kenneth Earl of Seaforth and Sir John Munro, there- 
« In defigned John Mynro younger of Fowjis, of which the

f tenor follows — " At Edinburgh the twentle third day of 
" January, javie and fextie one years, It is condeicended and 
« agreed as follows, that is to fay, We Kenneth Earl of bea- 
" forth, and John Munro younger of Fowlis, taking to our 
«« confideration how prejudicial it hath been to both our fa- 
*« milies that there hath not been of a long time, fo good a 
« correfpondence betwixt us as was befitting men of that 
«' conjundion and neighbourhood, and of what advantage it 
«« will be to us, to live in good correfpondence and confe- 
« deracie one with another, and to maintain and concur for 
«* the weal of either. For the which caufes, We the faid noble 
«' Lord, and John Munro younger of Fowlis, taking burthen 
" on us for our friends, kinfmen, and all others whom we 
** may ftop or let, do by thir prefents bind and oblige us and 
our heirs faithfully upon our honours to maintain and 
« concur with each other, for the good of both and our 
forefaids and to prevent as much as in us lyes, what may 
be to the prejudice of either of us or of any in whom ei- 
f* ther of us may be concerned in all time coming, as wit-

fhip between the chiefs of both clans, it cannot be denied 
that a good deal of the old fpirit difcovered itfelf on various 
occafions among their followers and adherents, till it was 
moft happily fupprefled at the memorable aera 1745 — 6. It 
is our good fortune to live in an age when we fee thofe whofe

Populaiion. — In order to afcertain with accuracy the popu. 
lation of this parifli, a furvey was made between the begin- 
ning of January and the middle of March 1791, from which 
we are enabled to give the following account of that impor- 
tant article:

From the foregoing lift it appears, I ft, that many of the 
inhabitants of the pari!Ti live to what may be reckoned old 
age; 2dly, that the numbgr of females far exceeds that of 
the males ; and, 3d]y, that the number of widowers is but 

fmall. 



i £f Kiltearti, nyi 

foiall, while the number of widows is fo great, as mufi: excite 
companion in every feeling breaft. If the number of houfeS 
6r Ihiokes lhall appear ronfiderable, let it be obferved, that 
moil: of them are miferable huts, and that fome of them are 
only inhabited by a pOor folitary widow, or by a fingle nian^ 
who works for days wages wherever he cati find employment. 
At different periods of time the population of this parilh has 
varied much, which can be eafily accounted for. We learn 
from good information, that, about the beginning of this cen- 
tury, there were nearly as many inhabitants in this parifli as 
there are at prefent. This fadl: leems to be farther eftablifh- 
Cd by fome old leflion regiflers of bapti(ms and marriages 
between the year 1700 and 1728, extrafts of which are fub- 
joined. It is to be regrerted that there are feveral chafms 
in thofe records, which prevents our giving the extradts fo 
completely as might be wiflied; but to fnew clearly that th'i 
population here had gradually diminifhed between the year 
1740 and 1770, lifts are given of the baptifms and marriages 
celebrated about that period, viz. from 1747 to 1752. The 
diminution of the number of inhabitants then can be very 
Nationally accounted for. That martial fpirit which has been 
a diftinguiftiing charafteriftic of the Munros', led peribns of 
every rank and defcription in this parilhi to fly to arms as 
foon as the trumpet founded the a'ar n of w.n-. By this 
means the flower of the young men of Kiltearn were fcatter- 
ed abroad in all the countries that have been the feat of war 
during that period; in Flanders, in Germany, in the Eaft 
and Welt Indies, and in Aiflerica ; befiJes, lever.il hundreds 
have gone as recruits to the Scots Crigade in Holland, which 
eftablilKinent was at that time one of the chief fi.:ld3 of pre- 
ferment for young gentlemen of family. It is no wonder, 
then, that a country which for a long time had been a nurfe- 
ry for the army, fliould,- in a courle of years, dscrer f^ confi- 

derabiy 



Statljikdl Account 



derably in population. But, at the peace 1763, fuch nuniS 
bers, both of officers and private foldiers, flocked home to 
their native country, that the populr.tion is fenfibly increafed 
Cnce that period. Add to this, that the various buildings 
and improvements which have been carried on in this neigii- 
bourhood within 20 years, has induced many labourers and 
artificers to fettle among us, and confiderably increafed the 
number of inhabitants. 

The following lifts, extrafted from the feffion records, will 
fully illuftrate what has been advanced above, by giving a 
view of the population at three feveral periods, viz. at the 
beginning of this century, about the middle of it, and at the 
prefent time.

Though no public regifter of the burials has been kept 
here, yet, from memorandums kept by private perfons, and 
the beft information we could obtain on the fubjeft, there is 
every reafon to believe that the above is a corredl ftatement 
for the laft feven years. 

Heritors, Rent, and Farms. '^Th.trt are fix heritors or pro- 
prietors of land in this parifh ; and the two moft confider- 
able of them refide conftantly in it ; one refides occafionally ; 
and the remaining three live upon other parts of their pro- 
perty. About 60 years ago, there were more than twice the 
prefent number of heritors ; but thefe were chiefly cadets of 
the family of Fowlis, who had at different periods derived 
their pofleffions from that family ; and, when thofe fmall he- 
ritors were obliged to fell off their lands, they have reverted, 
by purchafe, to the original proprietors. The valued rent of 
the parifh is L. 3 149 : 9 : 6 Scots ; the real rent about L. 1500 
Sterling. Formerly, the greateft part of the rent was paid 
in vi£lual ; but a good deal of the viihial is now coaverted.

It is not eafy to fay what the rate of converfion is, being dif- 
ferent on the properties of the'- feveral heritors. In ftating 
the rent of the parifli, we have fet no value on the exten- 
five plantations of growing timber, which mufl bring a con- 
fiderabie revenue to the proprietors in a few years, and may 
probably be eftimated at L. 30,000. As the greateft part of 
the lands in the parifh have been meafured by furveyors, we 
can give a pretty exadl account of the number of acres of a- 
rable ground, which are reckoned to be about 2250, exclu- 
five of woodlands and pafture ground that has never been 
cultivated. The lands have let at various prices •, fome acres 
at 20 s. fome at 17 s. 15 s. 12 s. 10 s. and none below 8 s ; 
but, as the arable and pafture grounds, both in the high and 
low diftrifts of the parifli, are ufuaily let to tenants in the 
lump, without diftinguifhing the value of each acre, the 
above eftimate is but conjectural, though founded on the 
befl information that can be had. One third part of the 
whole arable land in the parifti is now in the poflefiion of 
the proprietors, and has been occupied by them for feveral 
years paft. How far this may be favourable to their interefts, 
they will be beft able to judge when they fum up their ac- 
counts of profit and lofs ; but it is the prevailing opinion in 
this country, that gentlemen of fortune and landed property 
rather lofe than gain by extenfive farms. No doubt, much 
depends on their being fortunate in getting fltilful, aftive, 
and faithful overfeers. All the gentlemen's farms in this pa- 
rifli are at prefent managed, either by natives of the fouth of 
Scotland, or by pcrfons bred to farming there. It may there- 
fore be expedled that the fame implements of hufbandry, and 
the lime rotation of crops, will be found on thofe farms 
v.'hich are under their management, as we fee in Fife or Eaft 
Lothian, except when a dilferent mode of farming is pur- 
ged, to gratify the views of the proprietor. The next in

The principal farmers mentioned above keep good cattle and 
.farming utenfils ; and of late years they fow fome clover and 
rye-grafs feeds, as well as their landlords. They are alfo 
ambitious to have their farms properly inclofed, on rea- 
fonable terms ; but the other clafles of tenants confider in- 
clofures as a grievance, and would rather partake of every 
thing in common. Their cattle are alfo of an inferior fize ; 
and they never fow grafs feeds ; but, inftead of this, when 
their land is exhaufted by a repeated fuccelFion of crops, 
they allow it to lie lea or untilled for two or three years ; du- 
ring which time they pafture it till it gets a turf again and 
then till and fow it with oats, and kave another piece of 
ground lea in its turn. It is no wonder that thcfe farmers 
fliould have poor returns from their lands ; for, nothing but 
fcanty crops can be expelled from fuch wretched manage- 
ment. Another ciafs of people ftill remains to be mentioned, 
who, though they cannot be ftridtly called farmers, are fo ia 
part, as they occupy one, two, or three acres of ground. 
Thefe are commonly called cottars, i. e. cottagers, or mail- 
-ers, and often hold of the principal farmer. They do not 
^-^epend on farming for their entire fupport, being, in ge- 
neral.

neral, artificers, mechanics, or day-labourers and thefe laft 
do more juflice to their lands, and rear better crops on 
their fmall lots than the poor tenants do on larger pofief- 
fions. We fliall not attempt to give the exafi; number of aH 
the cottars and mailers in the parifii ; but of fuch of them as 
are artificers and mechanics, toget^ier with ;heir apprentices,

We may obferve, that, as the above number of mecha* 
nics cannot be fqppofed to find conftant employment in the 
parifh, they work occafionally in the neighbourhood, and 
employ their leifure hours in cultivating their fmall lots of 
land, where potatoes are always the ftapTe crop. Among 
fuch a number of farmers as we have defcribed, there mult 
be various methods of culture. On the farms of the bet- 
ter fort, it is common to fee two ftrong horfes yoked in the 
plough, under the management of a fingle ploughman, or 
iix oxen yoked in fuccefllve pairs, which require a driver. 
Others, again, join two horfes and two oxen, believing that 
the fprlghtlinefs of the horfes vrill c^irry forward the oxet^ 
with more alacrity. But the poorer tenants yoke in one 
plough, horfes, oxen, arid cows, promifcuoufly, which often 
exhibit a miferable fpedacle, and clearly fhews that they are 
more folicitous to increafe the number, than improve the 
quality of their cattle. Within a dozen years, an improve- 
ment

Blent has been introduced, which deferves to be peculiarly 
attended to, as it has anfwered all the good purpofes that 
were expected from it, viz. The oxen are now harnefled 
by many farmers in the fame manner as horfes, which they 
work in the plough ; the confequence is, that the animal 
draws with more power, and alio with more feeming eafe to- 
itfelf, than when it was yoked by the neck. And, to pre- 
vent any inconveniency arifing from the horns of the ox in 
putting on the collar, there is a ftrap and buckle ufed, by 
which the collar opens and Ihuts. The prevailing opinion 
feems to be in favour of labouring with oxen rather than 
horfes, which are liable to fo many accidents, and a certain 
lofs in the end ; but it has fared with this, as with many o- 
ther juft maxims, it is more readily alTented to in fpeculation 
than reduced to pradtice. There are about lo oxen wains 
now in this parifh, befides 30 coops or box carts, drawn by 
two horfes, employed by the proprietors and principal farm- 
ers. About twenty years ago, there were Ibarcely half that 
number. There are near 1 00 ploughs of all forts, but many 
of them very light and trifling. Befides the carts now men- 
tioned, there are about 300 fmall rung carts, as they are 
called, which are employed in leading home the fuel from 
the mofs, and the corn to the barn-yard. Thefe carts have, 
^illead of wheels, fmall folid circles of wood, between 20 
and 24 inches diameter, called tumbling wheels. It is alfo 
very common to place a coarfe, ftrong baiket, formed hke 
fugar loaf, acrofs thefe fmall carts, in which the manure is 
carried from the dung- hill to the field. Thefe kinds of carts 
gre called Kellachys ; and are not only ufed in this diftrift, 
but over all the north country. To form fome idea of the 
ftate of farming in this diftrift, we fubjoin the following abf 
&amp;ra£t of the manner in which the ground is laid down, toge- 
ther.

The averai 


'e returns from the above fowings are very incon- 


ixderable. 


The barley yields only about 5, 


and the oats 4 


returns. Hence, even in the beft 


years, the 


parifh can fpare 


very little 


corn for the market. 


The reafon why flax and

Price of Labour and Provifions. — The wages paid to fer- 
vants engaged in domeftic employments vary according to 
the circumftances of their mafters ; but the wages of thofe 
fervants who are employed in the labours of the field can be 
more eafily afcertained. Of thefe laft mentioned, fome eat 
in their mailer's houfe, but by far the greateft number live 
in cottages of their own, and receive 6 bolls of meal inftead 
of board, and L. 3 pounds Sterling of wages annually. This 
is the average rate for ordinary ploughmen and carters. From 
this rule, however, there are many exceptions, A plough- 



of Kiltearn, 

ifim who excels fometimes get L. 5 or L. 6 wages, and 8 or 
10 bolls of meal. Befides the above, every man fervant has 
the privilege of planting about half a boll of potatoes for his 
own ufe, rent free. The ufual wages of female fervants in 
farmers houfes is from L. i : 4 : o to L. i : 10 : o yearly. The 
common method of managing the harveft work is to hire 
a certain number of fliearers for the. harveft quarter, pro- 
portioned to the fize of the farm : This is the old cuftom. 
The men get about a boll and an half, and the women a boll 
of meal, inftead of meat and wages, during the harveft fea- 
fon. But the afcive and intelligent part of the farmers begin 
to fee the inconvenience of the above practice ; becaufe, while 
they are confined to a few hands, they may lofe by one ftor- 
my day as much as would defray the whole charges of cut- 
ting down the crops. Hence, they now hire their fliearerg- 
for the day, and increafe or diminifli their number according 
to the ftate of their crops. This is evidently the more ra- 
tional plan of the two. The men receive 7 d. per day, and 
the women 6 d. The price of mowing hay is ufually from 
2 s. 2d. to 2 8. 6 d. per acre. Day labourers receive for or- 
dinary work 6d. per day all rhe year through, and fomething 
extraordinary if their labour is harder than ufual. They are 
more willing, however, to work by the piece ; and then they 
will earn, perhaps, i s. and upwards per day. Trenching 
ground about 18 inches deep, if it be free from roots and 
ftones, cofts 4 d. the rood of 6 yards fquare ; but, if the foil 
is rugged, and hard to work, it ccfts 8 d. The price of grain, 
meal, and all forts of provifions, has been gradually ad- 
vancing for feveral years, and is not likely to fall. Per. 
haps the average price of barley and oat-meal, for 20 years 
paft, has been about 14 s. per boll. This obfervat ion, and 
what follows refpeding the price of provifions, holds true 
with regard to a confiderabk part of the county of Rofs, as:

Poor. — There is little difference as to the method of pro- 
viding for the poor in the feveral parirties of this county, but 
tvhat arifes from the largenefs or fmallnefs of the funds ap- 
propriated for that purpofe. It is truly matter of regret, 
that no proper and effeftual fcheme has ever been devifed 
among us to provide for the poor. At prefent they chiefly 
fubfift by begging from door to door, not only in the refpec- 
tive pariflies to which they belong, but over all the county \ 
and it would feem hard to prohibit them from begging, as 
they have no alternative but to ftarve. The weekly collec- 
tions made in the churches are very inadequate to the pur- 
pofe of fupporting the poor in any of our parifhes. In this 
parifli, the colle£lions never exceed L. 8 or L. 10 Sterling 
yearly. About L. 6 arifes from charitable mortifications, 
which, added to the above, makes the whole fund for the 
poor about L. 15. After paying the felEon-derk, and fome 

other 



of Kill cam, 281 

other officers of the church, there remains only about L. 10 
Sterling, which is diftrlbuted once a year among the moft 
indigent perfons of the parifh by the kirk-feffion, in prelcnce 
of the heritors. But how fmall a rehef can this afford, 
when there are ufaally above 100 perfons upon the poor's 
lift here, who have every claim to charity that indigence and 
infirmity can give them ? nor will it appear furprifing that 
the poor's roll in this place Ihould be lo large, when it is re- 
colkded that there are y6 widows in it. 

Rivers, Lakes, and Fi/herles.— kmong the feveral ftreams 
of water which run through this pa-ifh, only two of them 
deferve to be mentioned. Firft, Skiak, which falls into the 
fea, clofe by the church. The batiks on both fides are cover- 
ed with brufhwood and trees of various kiijds, mofi: of which 
grow naturally. This river being traced to its fource, is found 
to terminate in a coUeftion of fmall ftreams that meet toge- 
ther in the valleys, at the foot of the feveral mountains. The 
other river which we fliall mention is Aultgrande, /. e. in 
Gaelic, the ugly luater, or burn, fo called on account of fome 
rocks through which it runs down, that make a very formi- 
dable appearance, which will be more particularly defcribcd 
under the article Curioftties. This river falls into the lea 
about half a mile eaft of the former, and his its banks on 
each fide covered with trees and flirubs. When the fnow 
melts on the mountains, this river frequently pours down 
its ftreams with great rapidity, and often proves highly 
detrimerital to the adjacent lands. It takes its rife in 
Loch Glafs, a beautiful frefli water lake about 6 miles from 
the fea. This lake never freezes till about the fpring feafon, 
and not even then, unlefs the froft be uncommonly fevere. 
It is about 5 miles long, and near i mile broad, and navi- 
gable all the way. This, together with feveral other fmaller 

Vql. I. N n lakes 



Statiflical Account 



lakes fituated upon the north fide of Ben-Uaifh, affords abun^ 
dance of fine trout, though they are not of a large fize. There* 
is a fmall ifland near the fouth end of this lake, where it i^ 
fald one of the lairds of Fowlis had formerly a fummer- 
houfe. Befides the trout taken in the rivers and lakes, there 
are a good number of falmon caught on the fea coaft, 
fometimes by nets and cobles, called a Jlill fifiing^ but chief- 
ly by means of yaires, or fmall inclofiireSj built in a curve or 
femicircular form near the fhore. At high water the falmon 
conies within thefe yaires, and at low water is eafily taken, 
having- no way to efcape. This is the fimpleft and cheapeft 
mode of fifhing that can be devifed. There are ufually four 
or five yaires kept up in jlie parifh ; and each proprietor 
takes fifh enough to fupply himfelf and a few friends. In a 
a good fifliing feafon he can fend fome to market. Floun= 
ders, herring-fry, or fprats, are frequently taken in thfefe 
yaires.' 

FofftlSf Mines, and Minerafs. — In digging for peats in the 
mofles of this parifti, numbers of fir trees are found, which 
afford a clear proof that thofe extenfive trifts of ground were 
once covered with trees, which muO have added much to the 
beauty of the c0unti*y, and have been fhelter to the cattle. 
Thefe trees tliat are dug out of the moffes are perfectly found, 
and laft long when applied to the purpofe of building. One 
chief benefit derived from them is, that they burn well, and 
afford excellent light to the country peopk, who cannot af- 
ford to buy candles. Clay and fhell marl are to be found in 
this parifh. The clay marl is met with in a mofs called 
Boginturie, upon the eftate of Fowlis, 3 miles diftant from 
the fea fhore. There is abundance of it ; and it has anfwered 
well with thofe who have tried it. It will probably come in- 
fo more repute in proportion as the true notion of farming 

prevails.

prevails. The fliell marl, though of an excellent quality, 
does not afford fo rich a fupply as the other, as there is only 
a fmall vein that appears near the church, and is found ia 
the fame direftion about the weft end of the parifli. It is 
pretty remarkable that this fliell marl is found at the diftance 
of about 200 yards from the Tea, and at leaft 30 feet perpen- 
dicular above its level. There are very flattering appear- 
ances of coal in all the weftern part of the parifli, from the 
.fea to the hills. Several years ago, one or two attempts were 
rnade to difcover a proper mine, but it was not purfued with 
that ardour and perfeverapce which the importance. of the 
,obje£t deferved. The perfons. formerly employed only bored 
in 2 or 3 places. They acknowledged that they found coal, 
but pretended it lay fo deep, that unlefs the vein was confide- 
■rable, it would not pay the expence of working ; but we can- 
not help fufpefting that they knev/ but little, and prefumed a 
great deal. Cpnfidering, however, the public fpirit and inde- 
pendent fortunes of feveral gentlemen. concerned, it is to be 
hoped that they will once more make a fair trial of the coal 
mines in this diftridl, by finking one or two pits, and employ- 
ing fome ikillful hands for a few months to work in the 
mines, and afcertain the v^lue of the coal. The expence 
would not be very great : The attempt would at leaft be lau- 
dable, and moft probably would be crowned with fuccefs. In 
a. rock on the banks of Aultnacaorach, the peep burn^ (a 
rivulet that falls into Aultgrande), there are indications of 
lead ore. The only .trial ever made of it y/as about 56 years ago, 
by one Charles Smith, a common miner, who finelted a piece 
of the ore taken from this rock, which produced good lead. 
Near the ftorehoufe of Fowlis there is a chalybeate ipring, 
which has been drank with falutary effedls about 60 years 
2go. There is another fpring at Teinleod, above Fowlis 
jCaftle, called St Colman's Well. Whether it has any me-

dicinal virtue wc have not heard; but it was a common prac- 
tice, in the memory of fome ftill alive, for fuperftitious per- 
fons to frequent the well, and, after drinking the water, to 
tye fome rags to the branches of the furrounding trees. 

Roads and Bridges. — Very particular attention has been paid 
of late years to the roads in this diftricl •, and the bridges have 
been widened for the convenicncy cf carriages. The new 
bridge over AuItgranJe is remarkably neat, and well finiflicd, 
and does credit ro Mr Kyle, the archite6V, who built it. All 
the bridges arc built and kept in repair at the expence of the 
county. The roads are kept in repair by the ftatute labour, 
which the inhabitants perform perfonally, and very feldom 
by commutation. An improvement is now majcing on the 
road tb.p.t leads through this parifh, which will add much to 
the plcafure and con.forr of travellers. The chief heritor 
has, at a conlidcrable expcncc, carried off the road in a fweep 
or curve, about a quarter of a mile farther fouth than it was 
formerly. By this nieanc, travellers will not only pafs through 
the middle of rich fields and fine plantations of trees, but 
will alfo have a full view of that antient and elegant manfion, 
Fowlis Caftle. This improved road was begun in 1790, and 
will be completed in the courfe of 1791. 

Villages, Schools, £5* ManufaBures. — There is only one fmall 
village in the parifli, called Drummond, fituated in a level 
field contiguous to the river Skiack. This village is yet in 
its infancy ; but, as the fituation of it is centricalj and a- 
greeable, being on the poft-road between Dingwall and No- 
var Inn, there is every reafon to believe that it will increafe 
confiderably in a few years. At prefent, there is a public 
houfe, two fhop- keepers, a dyer of woolen fluffs, who keeps 
a prefs and fcouring-mill ; and a few other mechanics. Two 



of Ktltearn* 285 

fairs or markets are held here annually ; the one early 
in June, and the other the firfl: week in December, where 
black cattle and other country commodities are fold ; 
and, though the proprietor exafls no toll or cuftom, he 
maintains a guard while the market lafts, to keep order, and 
prevent riots. The fair in December is known by the name 
of the GooCc-market. But, as no geefe are fold at it, the 
name Goofe-market has probably taken its rife from an en- 
tertainment ufually given by the gentlemen of the parifh to 
the principal inhabitants on the fecond day of the market, 
where a goofe (being then in feafon,) always makes a part of 
the feafl:. On this occafion, there is no excefs in drinking 
encouraged ; and the company meet merely for the fake of 
fecial intercourfe. Adjoining to the village of Drummond 
is the parifli fchool, which is commonly attended by 60 or 
80 children, and often by a much greater number. The fa- 
lary paid by the heritors to the mafter is a chalder of barley ; 
and, as precenter and fefllon-clerk, his emoluments will a- 
mount to about L. 4, befides the quarter-fees paid by the 
fcholars, which are as low and moderate as any where in Scot- 
land ; Englifh being taught for i s. per quarter ; writing 
I s. 6 d. ; arithmetic 2 s. ; and Latin 2 3. 6 d. It is no more 
than juftice to fay that the education of youth Is at prsfent 
conduced at the fchool upon the mofl: approved plan, and 
with correfpondent fuccefs. To which we may add, that, 
befides what is ufually taught at grammar fchools, feveral 
ther branches of ufeful fcience and literature are taught here, 
fuch as the French language, geography, geometry, book- 
keeping, and the diiFerent branches of pranical mathema- 
tics. This dcferves the more to be remarked, becaufe fo 
few country pariflies are favoured with firailar advantages 
for educating their youth. Within a quarter of a mile of the 
yillage of Drummond^ to the eaft, on the farm of Upper 

Balconyj 



s86 



Staii/ikal Aupunt 



Balcony, there is a licenfed dlftillery for aquavltae or whifky, 
■which pays L. 30, jind confumes about 180 bolls of barley 
yearly ; but it is much to be regretted that a great quantity 
of fpirits, befide the whole produce of this diftiilcry, is con- 
fumed within the parilh. On the oppolite fide of the river, 
and clcfe to the New Bridge, is Culcairn Bleachfield, the 
only one in the county. This bleachfield was firfl: efla- 
bliflied by the late John Munro, Efq; of Culcairn, father of 
the prefent proprietor of that name, in 1751. Though it 
promifed well for feveral years, yet it afterwards declined 
much, while it puffed through the hands of different mana- 
gers. In the year 1779, it fortunately fell into the hands 
of the prefent manager, William Tait, from Salton Bleach- 
field in Eaft Lothian. The proprietor, obferving that Mr 
Tait was not deficient, either in fkill or adlivity, refolved to 
give him every encouragement, granted him a leafe of the 
bleachfield, and built a comfortable houfe for him. A clear 
proof of the rapid progrefs this field has made under the 
prefent manager is, that, in the year 1779, there were only 
440 pieces of cloth bleached here; but, in the year 1790, 
the number of pieces amounted to 2242. The Honourable 
Board of Trufiees, being well informed of Mr Tait's induf- 
try and fuccefs, were pleafed, in 1786, to grant L. 50 for 
erefting a drying houfe. And it is not doubted that, on a 
proper reprefentation, they ,ivill give fome further aid to- 
wards fetting up proper machinery, and a complete bleaching 
apparatus, at this very fl.ourifliing field. 

Inns and Ale-houjes. — There are only two licenfed ale-hou- 
fes in the parifh which pay excife-duty ; one at Drummond, 
and the other at Wefter Fowlis. Thefe are neceffary for the 
accommodation of travellers, and for tranfadling country 
Jjufinefs. But there are a number of blind whiflcy houfes,, 

fituated 



of KilteavTi. 



2S7 



fituated in' obfcure corners, at a diftance from the public 
/oad. Thefe laft are much frequented by tipplers, and dram- 
drinkers, who fometimes fit up whole nights at their debauch. 
Such tippling-houfes have proved a great nuifance for feveral 
years pall, and have been very prejudicial to the health, the 
morals, and the circumftanees, of feveral inhabitants of this 
parifti. It is not uncommon to fee two mechanics, or 
day-labourers, repairing once or twice a-day to one of thefe 
enfnaring haunts, and drinking a choppin bottle of unmixed 
whiflky at each time, with as great eafe as their forefathers 
would drink a Scots pint of twopenny ale, or finali beer. 
What adds to the grievance is, that the keepers of thefe cor- 
rupting haunts are not always very fcrupulous as to the mode 
of receiving payment for their drink. When money fails 
they will receive meal and viftual at a low price, which is 
often flolen from the mills, and farmc-s barns. When this 
refource fails, they receive houfehold furniture, and wearing 
apparel. An evil that has come to fueh a height loudly calls 
for the interpofition of the civil magiflrate ; and it is a great 
pity that the gentlemen of the diftndt who are Juftices of the 
peace, and are remarkably temperate themfelves, have nos 
made greater exertions to fupprefs this growing eviL 

Advantages and Difadvatriagss. — As it is the common lot 
of mankind to have their condition in this world checqucr- 
ed with a mixture of good and evil, fo it cannot be denied 
that the inhabitants of Kiltearn have their own fhare, both 
of the advantages and difadvantages of life. It is a very fa- 
vourable circumrtance for this parifli, that it is fituated oa

point, where veffels from 80 to 100 tons burden may load 
and unload, and anchor with the greateft fafety, as there are 
no dangerous rocks or flielvey near the fliore. Excellent free- 
ftone quarries, that are eafily wrought, are to be met in e- 
very corner of the parifli. This circumftance, added to the 
abundance of timber, affords great encouragement to carry 
on buildings, and other improvements. The advantages of 
education which are to be had at the public Ichools here, is 
a very encouraging circumftance to determine fuch as have 
riling families to fettle among us. The prevailing tafte for 
buildings and improvements among the gentlemen of the pa- 
rifli is a great bleffing to artificers and day-labourers ; which 
was particularly experienced in the hard years 1782 and 
1783 j being, under God, the mean of preferving many fa- 
milies from perilhing for want of bread. But, as the gentle- 
men's improvements will foon be completed, many hands 
who are now employed will be at a lofs to provide for them- 
lelves and their families, unlefs fome manufactures are fpecd- 
ily eftablifhed j and, confidering the great number of women 
in the parifti, it would be defirable that fome manufacture 
ftiould be introduced to employ the females, and children of 
both fexes ; for it is a hard cafe, when a labouring man is 
unable to work, by age or ficknefs, that his family has no 
means of earning a fubfiftence, however unwilling to work. 
This leads us to mention another difadvantage which the poor 
women labour under here, which is, that they feldom have 
proper afliftance when in child-bed, as there is no regularly 
bred midwife in the parifli. This often proves of fatal con- 
fequence to women in that lituation, which, of all others, 
require the moft tender care, as well as (kill. It is alfo 
much to be wifhed that the inhabitants in general were better 
lodged than they can poffibly be in their prefent huts. In no 
country, perhaps, are the gentlemen better lodged, and the 

tenants

tenants worfe accommodated, than in this parifh ; for, who 
could fuppofe that, among the -^ii^ houles in the parifh, there 
are not forty, in which a perfon accurtomed to a decent ac- 
commodation, would choofe to lodge a fingle night. Per- 
haps their being lb frequently obliged to remove their cotta- 
ges makes them lefs felicitous to have them comfortably 
built. The greateft number are built of earth, and are ulu- 
ally razed to the ground once in 5 or 7 years, when they are 
added to the dunghill. Indeed, they cannot afford to build 
them of better materials, not even with clay and If one ; and 
yet, as a proof of the late increale of populationj when any 
of thefe mean huts become vacant, there arc perhaps five or 
fix candidates for them i and the fuccelstul one is fuppo- 
fed to owe the preference to fuperior intereft. But, among 
the chief difadvantages of this parifh may be reckoned the 
extreme poverty of many who become farmers^ Too many 
afiume this charadter who have hardly any llock to begin 
with ; and the confequence is, that, after ftruggling for a 
few years to keep credit, — they at lad link under the load of 
poverty, while the landlord has a long arrear of rent due to 
him. In a word, it cannot be denied that many among us 
have the name of farmers who ought more properly to be 
day labourers. Indeed, forae of their own hired iervants 
have the neceflaries of life with a greater c'egree of comfort 
than their maftefs, the farmers. One circumjlance very pre- 
judicial to the farmers is, that they are too much at the 
mercy of their fervants. When a fervant engages with a 
poor farmer, he bribes him with a promife of high wages ; 
and, wh-en money fails, he allows his fervant to few a quan- 
tity of corn for his own ufe, and to keep a cow In fummer, 
and perhaps two or three in winter, on the farm, which 
brings certain ruin upon the tenant in the end. We will addj 
that it is a great lofs to have fo few juQices of peace in the

diflri£l to take cognizance of this and other grievances. The 
lad particular we Hiall mention, under tiie head of difadvan- 
tage, is not confined to this parifli only, but is equally felt in 
the parifhes aro^und us, viz. the pcrfonal fervice of the te- 
nant?, rhefe, however, were formerly more grievous than 
at prefent ; for it is not long fince the farmers, their fervants, 
and horfes muft have been ready at a call from the laird 
when he had any operations to carry on on his farm, or o- 
therwife. They ploughed, harrowed, manured, and reaped, 
the landlord's farm, while their own were often neglected. 
Here, however, we muft obferve, that, in former times, 
theie fervices, though a brrfden, were not fuch a grievance 
as they would be now. The rents were then low, and mo- 
ney fcarce. Hence the lervices made a confidcrable parr of 
the revenue whjch landlords derived from their lands. But 
now the cafe is altered ; and, wherever tenants are expected 
to thrive, perfonal fervices murt be difpenfed with, and 
commuted. That which has been longcft kept up, is the 
providing a certain quantity of peats or fuel for the mafter 
yearly, which interferes much with the labours of the huf- 
bandman, as his whole time is employed m {.rovidiD^ his 
own and his landlord's fuel, fro. a the time the feed is lown 
tin the beginning of harvelt. Thus, he lofes all that time in 
which he ought to provide manure for his land. 1 he per- 
fonal fervices of the tenants are, however, always limited, 
and as exasflly known as the rent of the farm. Some propri- 
etors of lands in the parilh have begun, of late, to accept of 
a converfion for all fervices, ind alio to grant ieafes to the 
induftrious part of the farmers. If thefe converfions were 
moderate, and if the tenants were encouraged to build decent 
houfes, it would conduce to the comfort of the farmer, and 
the intereft of the landlord.

Language, and Etymology of Names. —The language com- 
monly fpokeii here is the Gaelic, or £arle i but. of late years, 
the tnglifli begins to be more cultivated than formerly, and 
is underftood by the generality of the inhabitants. 'I'he 
church lervice is performed here, as in the greateft part of 
the county, in Gaelic in the forenoon, and in Iinglilli in the 
afternoon. 

The names of places feem, in general, to be of Gaelic ori- 
ginal. For exa.iiple, B ilcony, that is, in Earfe, a dwtlling- 
place This is a Deautifui feat, fituated on the banks of the 
river Skiack, on a fine eminence, which flopes gradually to- 
wards the fea. This was formerly one of the feats of the 
antient Earls of Rofs. Hence it is called Balcony vie Dho- 
nail, or MacHonald's habitation. Krtvval, that is, in Earfe, 
Kead vail, or, the firft pofTeffion, acquired by the Earls of 
Rois in this parifh. Tennaird, that is, the houle on the height. 
Moun^gerald is a modern name given by Mr M'Kenzie, 
father to the prefent proprietor, to a place formerly called 
Ciyne, being fituated on an intlined plain. This name was 
given in allufion to Fitzgerald, who cime from Ireland, and 
who was the progenitor of the M'Kenzies. 

Antiquities and Curiofttits. — About h:ilf t mile to the weft 
of the houle of Clyne, and a quarter ot a mile to the north 
of the poft road, is a remarkable piece of antiquiry, which 
plainly appears to have been erected by the Druids, and ufed 
by them as a place of facred worfhip. It confifls of a fingle 
row of twelve large flones, placed upright, and lo difpofed as 
to form two ovals, which are joined to each other. The 
areas of thefe ovals are equal; they are 13 feet from eafl to 
weft, and lo feet in the middle from north to louth. At the 
end of one of them is a ftone, which rifes 8 feet above the 

furfac 



29* Sfatijikal Account 

furface of the earth ; the other hones are from 4 to 6 feet 
long. There is alfo, in the middle of this oval, a flat Itone, 
^hich was probably the altar; it feems to have flood for- 
merly at the eaft end, but has been thrown down by fomc 
accident. Diftant about 3 paces from the eaftern oval is a 
circuhr hollow, laid to have been a well of a confiderable 
depth, but it is now filled up ; its diameter at top is 8 feet. 
Thcfe ovals are fituated on the top of an eminence, round 
which are marked out three concentric circles ; one at the bot- 
tom, anofher 28 paces above the former, and the third 1 2 paces 
higher, immediately furrpunding the ovals. The circumfe- 
rence of the firft is 80, pf the lecond 50, and of the third, 
or higheft circle, 35 paces. It is ohfervable, that thefe cu- 
rious remains have a great refemblance to many others in dif- 
ferent places of Great Britain, particularly to thofe in the pa- 
rifh of Addington, near Mailing in Kent, (an account of which 
is given by Mr Colcbrqoke in the Archaeolo^ia, vol. ii. page 
107.), and the celebrated ones at Stonehenge in Wiltfhire *. 
L.irge conical heaps ot ftones, or cairns, as they are called, 
are to be met with oq the tops of many of the hills and emi- 
nences in the parifh. About 800 paces to the weft of the 
above ruin is a circular cairn, in diameter about 3c paces, 
containing, in the center, a grave 3 feet 6 inches long, 18 
inches broad, and 14 inches deep, neatly lined with four flat 
flones, and covered by another. There are alfo at the 
circun-iference three graves of the fame dimenfions, on the 
eaft, fouth, and weft, but they are in a more ruinous condi- 
tion than the central one. It is probable that thele wtre the 
fepulchres of a certain family or tribe ; the chief was buned

IB the center, and his relatives or dependents at certain di- 
ftances around him. But we fhall be at a lofs to account for 
the fmallnels of thefe graves, unlels we fuppoCe them to have 
contained only the aflies or bowels of the deceafed perfon. 
Thelc, it is likely, were depofited in earthen pitchers or vafes, 
as feveral velfels of that kind have been dug up by the plough 
in the neighbourhood of thefe cairns. There is alio on the 
north fide of the river .Skiack, and nearly oppofite to the 
village of Drummond, a grave of an oblong lorm, lined with 
ftone in the fame manner as thoft above delcribed j it is call- 
ed the Frieft's Sepulchre, and is 7 feet long, 3 broad, and 
about 3^ deep, it is evident from thefe remains, and many 
others of a fimilar nature, which abound in almoft every part 
of the Highlands of Scotland, that it was the cuflom of our 
anceftors to cover their burying places with heaps of ftones ; 
and the realon probably was, to prevent the bodies from be- 
ing dug up, and devoured by the wolves, wild boars, and 
other beafts of prey, which then infeft:ed the country *. 
Tht;re are ruins of five different chapels and burying places 
in this panfh, viz. one at Balcony, called St Ninian^ Chapel, 
one at Culnafkeath, one at Wefter Fowlis, one at Kilchoan, 
and one at Limlair, near the fea iliore, c;;lled St Mary's Cha- 
pel. Several famdies continue ItiU to bury at the lall named 
church-yard, and there are fome veftiges of the manfe, or 
minifter's houfe, contiguous to It. The laft incumbent's 
name was Mr Henry Kincaid, who feems to have lived about 
the beginning of the laft century ; for it appears from fome 
records that he diipolcd of certain tcinds to the Baron of 
Fowlis in 1607.

The natural curiofry that chi .fly defcrves notice is the 
rock called Craig- Tandf, or iWe ugly rock. This is a deep 
chalm or abyls. forintd by two oppofite precipices that rife 
per todicularly to a great heiglit, through which the Ault- 
graude runs tor the Ipacc of 2 miles. It begins at the di- 
ftance of 4 miles from the lea, by a bold proj^'dlion in'o the 
channel of the riv';r. which it dimintfhes in breadth by at leaft 
one half. The river continues to run with rapidity for about 
three quarters of a mile, when it is confined by a fudden jut- 
ting out of the rock. Here, the fide view from the fummit 
is very ftrikmg. The courfe of the ftream being thus im- 
peded, it whirls and foams, and beats with violence agaiuft 
the oppofing rock, till, colleOing ftrength, it fhoots up per- 
pendicularly with great fury, and, forcing its wiy, darts with 
the fwiftnefs of an arrow through the winduig paifage on the 
other fide. After paffing this obftruilion, it becomes in 
it;my places invifible, owing partly to the increaling depth 
and narrownefs of the chafm, and paitly to the view being 
intercepted by the numerous branches of trees which grovsr 
or each fide of the precipice. About a quarter of a uiilc far- 
th'^r down, the country people have thrown a flight briifge, 
compofed of trunks of trees covered with turf, over the rock, 
where the chalm is about 16 teet wide. Here the obferver, 
if he has mtrepidity en'-.-gh to venture himfelf on fuch a tot- 
tering iuppoit, and can 1 ok down on the gulph below with- 
out any uneafy fenfations, will be gratified with a view equal- 
ly awful and aftoniihing. The wildnefs of the fteep and rug-

the face of the rock ; all which is very gratifying to any one 
who takes a forenoon's ride for pleafure. But, as the fine 
plantations contribute fo much to the beauty of this parifh, 
we cannot avoid taking notice of it as a remarkable event, 
greatly to be regretted, that, upon the 17th day of January 
1791, the high wind broke down, and tore up by the roots, 
about 6000 fine firs in the different plantations upon the eftatc 
of Fowlis. We muft not omit to take notice of a place call- 
ed Corrivackie, which is fo fituated behind the great hill of 
Uaifh, that the fun does not fhine there from November to 
the beginning of March. 

Church. — It has never been afcertained beyond a doubt 
who is patron of this parifh. The only claimants are, the 
Crown, and the family of Fowlis. All the minifters from 
the Revolution, down to 1770, were fettled by a call from 
the heritors. The prefent incu(nbent, and hir predeceflbr, 
were fettled by royal prefentations. Mr Harry Robertfon 
was tranflated from Clyne to Kiltearn the 9th May 1776, He 
has been jiiarried fince 1772, and has 8 children now living, 
4 fons and 4 daughters. The church of this parifh was 
handfomely rebuilt in 1 790, at the expence of L. 700 .Ster- 
ling. Ihemanfe and offices were built in 1762, at a very 
moderate expence. They require iome repairs ; and there is 
no doubt that they will loon be made comfortable. The fti- 
pend conSfls of 136 bolls, half oat-meal, and half barley, and 
L. 32 .Sterling, with a glelt of 4 acres arable ground, with- 
out any grals. 

Eminent Men — Though every age, and every foil, does 
not produce men of eminent talents, it cannot be denied that 
Kiltearn has given birth to feveral who have done honour to 
their native country. The Munros have diftinguiflied them-

fclves, at different periods, by their martial fplrit and warlike 
atchievements. This circumftance is taken notice of by Bu- 
chanan, in the 17th book of his Hiftory, where, after fpeak- 
ing of the difficulties in which Mary Qu^een of Scots was in- 
volved at Invernefs, he adds, " That, as foon as they heard 
* of their Sovereign's danger, a great number of the antient 
*' Scots poured in around her, efpecially the Frafers and 
«« Munros, which (fays he) were efteemed among the moft 
** valiant of the clans inhabiting thofe countries." And, in 
the war carried on by Guftavus Adolphus, King of Swe- 
den, againft the Emperor Ferdinand II. there were fo ma- 
ny of the name of Munro, that, among the officers of 
that name who ferved in that war, there were 3 generals, 
8 colonels, 5 lieutenant-colonels, 1 1 majors, and above 30 
captains, befides a great number of fubalterns. Many of them 
gained great reputation in this war, particularly their chief, 
Robert Munro, the 21ft Baron of Fowlis, who fo diftinguifti- 
cd himfelf by his military condu£l:, that he was made colonel 
of two regiments at the fame time, one of foot, and another 
of horfe. It is not neceffary, on this occafion, to enumerate 
the feveral illuftrious characters that fprung from the houfe 
of Fowlis, as this has already employed the pen of a very 
learned and pious writer *. But, it woulJ be unpardonable 
to omit mentioning the late Sir Robert Munro, who was kill- 
ed at the battle of Falkirk on the 17th January 1746. There 
are ftill many living witneffes to atteft how great an orna- 
ment he was to his name and to his country. His conduct

all Great Britain ; and th^re is flill extant a copy of a let-

firing him to thank the King of Great Britain, in his name, 
for the excellent behaviour of the Highland regiment, while 
they were in his territories, •* which, (as he fays exprefsly) 
*' was owing to the care of Sir Robert Munro, their lieute- 
** nant-colonel ; for whofe fake (he adds) he fhould always 
•* pay a regard to a Scotfman for the future." Sir Harry 
Munro, fon to Sir Robert juft mentioned, was highly difcin- 
guifhed in another hne, as a fcholar of the firft rank. In 
claffical learning he was an uncommon proficient. He laid 
the foundation of his learning at Weflminfter fchool, and 
perfefted it at the univerfity of Leyden. He employed his 
leifure hours, for near 20 years, in writing a large critical 
work upon Buchanan's Pfalms, which he tiniflied, and left 
completely prepared for the prefs. This work he fubmitted 
to the review of the late learned Mr Thomas Ruddiman, who 
gave his approbation of it, and paid the highefl: compliments 
to the claflical knowledge and critical abilities of Sir Harry ; 
which appears by a holograph letter of Mr Ruddiman's, ftill 
extant in the library at Fowlis. Sir Harry having gone to 
Edinburgh for the recovery of his health, died there on ths 
I2thjune 1781. Some divines have alfo flourifhed in K;I- 
team that would do honour to any parifh ; but we fliall only 
mention twe. The firfl is Mr Donald Munro. This emi- 
nent man, cotemporary with the celebrated Buchanan, wai 
defcended of the family of Coul, a branch of the Munro's. 
He was firfl Archdeacon of the Ifles, and gave Buchanan a 
defcription of them, which he acknowledges in his Hiftory •. 
He was afterwards appointed fuperintendant of Rofs, and 
parfon of Kiltearn. The other is Mr Thomas Hog, who was 
fettled minifter at Kiltearn in 1655, but was turned out at 
the reftoration to make way for an Epifcopal minifter. He 
fuffered much perfecution, being long imprifoncd in the Bafs:

When he obtained his liberty he retired to Holland, where 
he was highly efteemed for his learning and piety. There is a 
pamphlet publilhed, containing memoirs of his life, and many 
remarkable anecdotes of him. There are feveral fa£ts well 
attefted, which indicate that he had a remarkable prefenti- 
nient of future events refpe^ting the Church in general, and 
himfelf in particular. Even at a period when, to all humaa 
appearance, it was moft unlikely, and when he was obliged 
to tly from his country and charge, he foretold, with the 
molt affured confidence, that there would be fuch a revolu- 
tion as happened afterwards, and that he fliould return to his 
charge at Kiltearn, and be buried there ; which accordingly 
turned out as he had faid. And, in confideration of his emi- 
nent worth, and great fufferings, King William was pleafed 
to appoint him one of his Chaplains for Scotland ; but he 
died very foon after his appointment, at Kiltearn, in 1692, 
and is buried at the entry to the fouth-weft door of the 
church. Some perfon, out of refpcJl for his memory, and 
zealous to exprefs the fenfe he had of Mr Hogg's uncommoa 
worth, caufed the following fmgular infcription to be put on 
his grave-ftone : " This ftone will witnefs againft the pa- 
" rifliloners of Kiltearn, if ever they bring in an ungodly 
«« minifter here." But, while we pay the juft tribute of praife 
to thofe whofe ftations and advantages of education enabled 
them to diftinguifli themfelves in the world, it would be un- 
juft to overlook thofe bloflbms of genius that fhoot forth ia 
the humble walks of life. Here, a watchmaker in this parifli 
naturally occurs to our view. This man (now about 30 years 
of age) was born and brought up in the Highland diflriit of 
this parifn, and, although he never faw a watch or clock till 
he was grown up to manhood, yet, by mere intuition, has 
made feveral clocks of coarfe materials, which go well. He 
only wants a little inftrudlion and affiftance to make a figure

in his line. It is a pity that he can neither read nor write, 
and hardly fpeaks Englifli. There is alfo a fchool-boy, abou£ 
1 6 years of age, who difcovers a good tafte for drawing, and 
promifes to arrive at fome eminence in that art, if his genius 
was properly cultivated : As he is of a weak conftitution, he 
is not fit for any hard labour. Such in fiances of genius, who 
want the advantages of education, are frequently to be met 
with in the world, and naturally fuggefi: to the feeling heart 
that thought which Mr Gray fo beautifully exprefles in his

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1818828">ROTHESAY</name>. 



By the Rev. Mr Archibald M'Lea,</head> 


<p>
Name, Situation^ Extent. 
IHE antient Gaelic and patronimic name of the pariHi is 



JL Cilla'bhruic. The modern, and perhaps the antient 
name, by which it was generally known, by rhofe particularly 
who do not fpeak the Gaelic language, is Rothefay. The 
meaning of Cilla'bhruic is. The church dedicated to St Broke, 
of which he is the tutelar faint. There is a yearly fair held 
in the town of Rothefay, called Feil-bhruic, or St Broke's 
fair. The etymology of Rothefay is not fully afcertained. 
Some fuppofe it Danifh. If it is of Gaelic original, the moft 
natural and probable etymology of it is, Riogh-Suidhe, that 
is, The King's feat, perhaps from there being an old caftle 
in it, called the Caftle of Rothefay, fonietimes the refidence 
of certain of the Kings of Scotland. By thofe who fpeak the 
GaeUc language, the parilh is always called Cilla'bhruic, or 
Sgireachd Bhruic, that is, St Broke's parilh. And the 
town of Rothefay is called Bailea Mhoide, or. The towa 
where the court of juftice is held. The ifland of Bute itfelf

1639, while prefbytery was the eftabliflied form of church 
government, the parifh of Rothefay was within the prefby- 
tery of Irvine or Cuninghame, and fynod of Glafgow and Air. 
In the year 1639, it was disjoined from that prefbytery and 
fynod, and annexed to the Prefbytery of Denoon, and fynod 
of Argyle, to which it ftill continues united. In the time of 
Epifcopacy, it was within the diocefe of tlie Illes ; and, by 
the aft of parliament in 1617, appointing the chapter of the 
Bifliop of the Ifles, the Parfon of Rothefay was made Sub- 
dean of the Illes. The parifli may be about ten miles long, 
and from three to four broad. 

Population. — There is no particular account of the antiant 
ftate of the population of the parilh ; but, from the number 
of ruinous and wafte houfes which were in the town of 
Rothefay, it would appear to have been pretty populous, and 
of fome note at an early period. About the year 1762, fome 
of thefe ruins were begun to be rebuilt ; and, lince that pe- 
riod, the town has been gradually increafmg fo much, that, 
not only the former ruinous houfes have been all re-built, 
but a number of new ftrcets laid out and finifhed.

The regifler for baptifms and marriages, but not of

1 69 1, until thefe regifters were taxed, within thefe few 
years, by aft of parliament. As an objeft of taxation, 
it muft turn to little account. As an objedl of police, 
attention to thefe regifters might become of confiderable 
importance to the ftate. Were the prefent tax given to 
the kirk-feffion-clerk, as a falary for keeping the regifters 
of baptifms, marriages, and burials, in each parifli, in a regu- 
lar diftinfl manner; and for making out yearly, at a particu- 
lar terra, a full extraft of each, to be certified by the miniftec

of the parlfli, as a true and exafi: copy ; or by three elders in 
cafe of a vacancy ; together with an authentic account of the 
number of fouls in the parifli, made out in fuch manner as 
might be found neceflary ; and this extract and note of the 
number of fouls in the parish to be lodged, upon a certain day, 
each year, in an office at Edinburgh, appointed for that pur- 
pofe ; it would be a fource of valuable information, to which 
recourfe might be had, when found neceflary, with Uttle 
trouble. The caufc of the increafe of the population in the 
town of Rothefay, fince the year 1766, may be a cuftom- 
houfe eftabliftied there in 1765, the herring fifliery, and a 
cotton fpinning mill, erefted there about twelve or thirteen 
years ago. 

Church and Stipend, l3'c — The church was built about the 
year 1690, and the manfe in 1757. The ftipend is about 
L. 80 Sterling, exclufive of the manfe and glebe. The Earl 
of Bute is patron. There are four heritors in the country 
part of the parifh, and a number of fmall proprietors within 
the territory of the town. Tlie number of poor perfons re- 
ceiving charity may be about 70. The amount of colleSlions 
and funds for their fupport is about L. 60. 

Mifcellaueoiis Ohjervatlons — The language principally fpoken 
in the parifli is the Gaelic j the names of the places feem, in 
general, to be derived from it. Ihere is an old caftle in 
the town of Rothefay, now a ruin, but formerly fometimes 
tiie rcfidence of the Kings of Scotland, and afterwards inha- 
bited by the family of Bute, heritable conftables of it, till it 
•was burnt during the troubles in 1685. The fuel ufed 
in the country part of the parifh is peat, and fome coal. 
Scarcely any thing but coal is ufed in the town. It is ge- 
Ecrally imported from Giaftow, at a great expence. The 

price 



9f Roihefay. 3©5 

price at fliipplng there is 3 s. 6cl. a cart ; bui the rivcr-dues, 
or tonnage duty, &amp;c nearly double the price at Rothefay. 
The price of provifions, till within thele twenty or twenty- 
five years, was moderate \ but, during that period, has been 
gradually rifing, and is now regulated, in a great meafure, by 
the Greenock market, one of the deareft in Scotland. I he 
price of labour of all kinds has advanced greatly within thefe 
few years. A day labourer, about twenty years ago, could 
have been hired for 6d 7d. orSd a day ; but now they re- 
quire I s. or I s. 6 d. The people Are indultrious. There is 
a cott(in fpmning mill ere£ted in the tow i of Rothefay, 
which employs about 300 hands young and old. Many, both 
young and old, are alfo em()loyed infpinning, and in making 
and mending nets. The people are particularly fond of a 
a fea far ng life. About thirty years ag , all the boats 
belonging to the parilh^ except one or two half-decked 
barks of about fifteen tons for carrying coals, were open 
boatsy like thofe comnonly uled ior catching herrings j 
having m generally in that employment four men, or at leall 
three mtn and a boy \ and of thclc there might be fiom a 
hundred to a hundred and twenty. But now, bcfiues, ironi 
twelve to twenty of open boats, there may be between eighty 
and a hundred velTilb Oclonging to the panlii, from hfteen to 
one hundred tons burden. 

During the laft war, there were a number of feamen from 
the pariih in the navy lervice ; and, had the prize-money due 
to tliem been properly accounted for, it is bcheved that prcfs- 
warrants would have been unneccffary here ; but, as niatters 
are at prefeat managed, nothing but compnlfion will induce 
them to enter into the navy fervice. Many of them, to 
whom prize- money is due, can get no account of, nor even 
find out the agent in whole hands it is. Would it not an-

anfwer the purpofes of government equally well, were tlir 
management of prizes put into the hands of the pay-office, 
and government become accountable for it, as well as their 
wages ; and, inftead of obliging the leamen to employ a- 
gents and attornies, at a great expence and rilk, might not 
the jnfpeftor of the pay-office correfpond with the mi- 
nifters of the different pariihes to which the leamen belong, 
(which he is even at prefent fometimes obliged to do), and the 
fituation and circumftances of each ieaman's right an(i claim 
being, in the courle of the correipond^nce, alceftained, pay- 
ment might be had at the nearell bank, or an order given 
upoi. the nearefl cuftomhoule, without either nik or expence ? 
By adopting fome meafure of this kind, the miniiters of the 
parifhes where there are fea-fanng people would have much 
lefs trouble than they frequently have by the prefent mode 
of manage pent, and would at the fame time have the 
fatisfadlion of feeing juftice done to a fet of brave fel- 
lows, who have riiked their lives in the fervice of their 
pountry. 

The people enjoy. In a confiderable degree, the comforts 
and advantages of fociety, and feem contented with their 
fituation and circumftances. 



The principal grievances under which the people labour, is 
the partial and oppreffive duty on coals, to which, from 
their fituation, they are fubje^ted. Could this grievance be 
removed, either by freeing them from it altogether, or by 
laying a very trifling general duty on coals at the nit, it 
would be a great rtrlief to the people, and be a much mare 
produftive tax to government.

<p>

Name and Extent. 

THIS parlfli, fiunted in the ifland of Bute, has its name 
from fome rugged rocks on the (outh end of it, a- 
gainft which, when the wind blows from the fouth, the 
waves of the fea beat with great violence. In the original 
Gaelic, it fignifies, * A bold furious head.* It is about feven 
miles long from north to fouth. and, at an average, two miles 
broad from eafi: to weft ; bounded by the parifh of Rothefay 
on the north and north-weft ; by the fea on the weft, eaft, 
and louth. 

Surface, Soil, ^c. — When viewed at a diftance, the furface 
has a flat appearance, although there is a gradual afcent from 
the eaft and weft flaores to the middle of the parilh. There 
are a few little hills on the fouth part of it, but none of them 
remarkably high. There are fome plantations of fir trees, &amp;c. ; 
but the largeft plantations are round the houle of Mount Stu- 
art, the feat of the Earl of Bute, where there are a great many 
iine trees x)f different kinds. The houfe is elegant, and is 
moft delightfully iituated, about 2oo yards from the eafl 
fhore, having a near view of all the fhipping of the Frith of 

Clyde

Clyde pafling and repaffing. Nearly the whole of the parifli is 
incloied and fubdiviJed with ditch and hedge, which afford 
fiifltcr and warmth, and make an agreeable appeirance. ( he 
foil, m general, is light and fandy, fit (when properly culti- 
vated, which it has been in fome farms, out particul.irly about 
Mount Stuart, where fields have been, and are ItiU cultivated 
to the higheft perfeiflion), for crops of bai ley, turnip, rye- 
grafs, and clover of every kind. Inclofed land is let, at an a- 
Terage, from 10 s. to 15 s. per acre ; outfield land from 3 s. 
to 3 s. 6 d. per acre Farms, at an average, from L. 30 to 
L. 60 per farm. Nearly the one lialf of the rents are paid 
by barley ; the other h.ilf by oats and cattle. The te- 
nants find a ready fale for their barley to the diftillers of 
vvhifky in the ifland. For fome years paft, the price of bar- 
ley has been, at an average, from 18 s. to 20 s. per boll. The 
pirilh likewile produces oats. Perhaps too many are fown 
in this (oil. The price of oats, for feven years part, has 
been from 14 s. to 16 s. per boll. Largs is the only 
market town for oats. Potatoes are in great plenty ; and 
thele, with herrings, are the chief maintenance of the fjreareft 
number of the inhabitants for three quarters of the year. 
Clover and rye-grafs hay is fold to the inhabitants of Rothe- 
fay at 4 s. and 5 s. per truls, equal to 15 ftone llnglifti. 
The average price of oat- meal, for leven years, has been from 
16 s. to lb' s. per boll, 9 flone weight in the boll. 

Caitle. — The breed of horfes is much improved of late. 
Every farmer has a cart or carts, according to the fize of his 
farm. About twenty years ago there were none in the pa- 
rlfli, except at Mount Stuart. Black cattle are not much im- 
proved, owing to their fcanty feeding when young. 

Poor, — The poor are maintained by weekly collections. 



3 1 o Stati/lical Account 

By afl: of the kirk feflif^n, every one who is admitted to be a 
conftant penfioner muft fign a difpofition of his efFedts (if a- 
ny, at his or her deceafe), to the kirk-feffion, to be given to 
the furviving poor. Since the year J 782, we have tew or 
rather no beggars. By the beneficence of the Earl of Bute, 
and by other charitable donations, they have not been lo ne- 
ceflitous as they were before the year 1782. 

Servants. — Their wages are advanced of late more than a 
third. Men-fervants wages are from L. 6 to L. 8 per annum 
women- fervauts wages are from L. 3 to L. 4 per annum ^ 
day-labourers have in winter trom 6 d. to 8 d. a day, with 
their maintenance ; in ipringand fummer from 8 d. to i© d ; 
in harvefi:, women hireti by the day have 8 d. a day, and 
their di; ner ; if hired for the whole time of harveft, from 
16 s. to 1 8 s. and their maintenance. There are no men- 
reapers , the coi n is ail cut down by women ; and the mea 
tie the fheaves and flook them. 

Ftp and game. — There are fifti of ahnoft every kind on 
each tide of the' parilh ; but the natives never tifh for any 
kind, excepting herrings. Of thefe they are uncommonly 
foad, which prevents them from trying, to catch others. 
In the fpring, when they are not employed at the herring- 
fifhery, would they apply themfelves to the catching of cod 
and haddocks, &amp;c. they would furely be gainers. Flfh of the 
above kinds are taken by north country ftrolling fifhermen, 
and lold at high prices. Hares, partridges, and fnipe*, are 
in plenty. 1 here are iikewife green and grey plovers ; fome 
wnters a great many woodcocks, abundance of ducks and teel, 
with other fea-fowl, which are common to the weftern fhores 
•f Scotland. 



of Kingarth* 311 

€limaie. — This parifli, though damp, is mild and tempe- 
rate, and very healthy, owing probably to the lahne particles 
impregnating the air, and the dry farrtly foil of the parifli. 
There are no epidemical dileafes in the parifti. I he only 
diltemper is the rheumatiim ; but it is not frequent. Ihere 
are many inftances of longevity in the parilh. Three men 
died this winter, one 94, each of the other two 84 years 
•Id. 

Language and Characler, — Moft of the natives fpeak Englifh 
very well ; although, in converiing with one another, they 
fecm to be fond of the Gaelic, their mother tongue, which 
chiefly prevails among the old people, and may have been an 
hindrance to the more eafy and more ready introduction of 
new methods of improvemenrs in the parifli. They are a fo- 
ber, peaceable, ana charitable people. 

Patron, Heritors , and St pend, Id'c. The Earl of Bute is 
patror., and almofl: fble proprietor of the panfli. Diere are 
only four heritors of fmall property, not amounting to L. 200 
per annum. The flipend conliits of 78 bolls of vidluai, half 
meal, half barley ; the meal at 9 flone weight per boh, the 
barley 4 firlots per boll j L. 36 : 15 : 4 Sterling of money, 
■with a mante and glebe. The manfe and office- houles were 
all new built in 1769. There are three churches in the pa- 
rifh. One of them is built near the fouth end, between the 
year 1000 and 1100. It is now almofl in ruins. The other 
two are in pretty good repair, particularly the one on the 
Ihore near Mount Stuart floufe. Worfliip is only performed 
in it when any of the family are th re. The other kirk is 
the ordinary place of worfliip, named the Mid-Kirk, being 
?Uore centrical for the inhabitants. 



Schools-. 



3 1 a Staftflical Account 

Schools. — There are at prelent three fchools. i ft, A pa- 
rifh Ichool, the falary L. 6 Sterling ; 2d, a Ichool, endowed 
and lupported by the fociety for propagating Chriftian know- 
ledge, falary only L. 6 per annum, a free houfe, kale-yard, 
and a cow, maintained furaiiuer and winter by the dillnd. It 
is fituated on the north wt. ft fide of the parifli, where young 
children are too far from the parochial fchool. The 3d is in 
the north weft quarter ot the parifti ; and the teacher is paid 
by the inhabitants of that quarter. 

Antiquities. — On the fouth-weft part of the parifti, on a 
little rocky hill, there are evident veftiges of a vitriried wall, 
faid to be a Danifli fort ; but it feem moie probable that it 
was made by the inhabitants to defend the ifland from the 
attacks of the Danes and Norwcgi-ms. fhe hill, in 'he ori- 
ginal, lignifies, ' 1 he hill of the Lowland men.' On a 
plain piece of ground, at a little diftancc from the the Mid- 
Kirk, there are evident remains of a Druidical temple, three 
large ftoncs of which are ftill ftanding. It had been fur- 
rounded w'th wood. There are large trunks ot oak trees ia 
a morafs, not above 200 yards from the temple.

Bv a lift; taken in March i7ii, the number of the inha- 
bitants is 727. ihcy have clecreaied 230 within thefe fifteen 
years, ihc realon is, that the town of Rothclay finds em- 
ploy laent for day labourers, and otner workmeu, and affords 
them higher wages than ih^ey can receive in a country pa- 
rifh The population, according to Dr Webller, was 1^79 
fouls. 

Advantages and Difadvatitages — There is a ready fale for 
every kind of produce, either ai Rot'iefay, Greenock, or the 
Largs. 1 here arc two packets every week from Rothefay, 
and a ferry- boat once every week from Scoulay, near Mount 
Stuartj to the Largs. Few of the inhabitants export their 
own commodities ; buyers come to the ifland, and jre at the 
expence of ferrying them over to the other lide. The dif ad- 
vantages are, ift. Want of coal. Trials have been often 
made to find coal, and within this five years by Lord Mount 
Stuart lending men ikillcd in that enijployraent from New- 
caftle ; but unfortunately all their trials were ineffectual. The 
parifli abounds with limeftone j and, if a good Icam of coal 
could be found, the ifland would be the wealthieft in the 
kingdom. Poffibly that may yet be effected, if farther trials 
were made. 2dly, The farmers being employed the mofl: 
part of the fummer in carting and leading peats, cannot pro- 
vide manure for their farms, the tumiaer lealon being the 
fitteft for that purpoie ; but what for fome years pafl appears 
to be the greatelt difaJvantage to the farming intercft of the 
parilh is the bounty to the buis-fifhing, which is carried on 
to a great extent in Rcthelay. Few farmer's Ions are bred 
to farming, fo purchafe a fmall fliare in a herring bufs, 
and become mifler of it, feems to be their great ambition. Ic 
is a faft, that all the young men of the parill: engage in the 
herring fifhery j and, when once engaged, though they have

HOUSTOUN and Killallan were or iginally feparate pa- 
rillics, but fo intermixed, with reipedt to their local 
fituation, that the people in one quarter of Killallan were obli- 
ged, if they kept the Iiigh road, to travel every Sunday clofe 
by the gate of Houftoun kirk, to attend puMic worfliip at Kill- 
allan, near two EngMh miles up the count y ; and another 
quarter to travel acrofs the middle of Houltoun pari(h, to 
KilUllan, for the fame purpofe. This inconvenient fituation 
of the parifhes m.ide it neceffary for both to join together ia 
the celel-wation of the Lord's hupper, and to oWerve all the

There is a fair held in the month of Ju.y in the village, call- 
ed Peter's Day Houlloun, the more modern name of the 
parilh, may be fuppofed to be a corruption of Hew's town, 
perliaps from Hugo de Padviiian, who is faid by Mr Craw- 
ford, in his lliltory of Heiifrew fhire, to have obtained a grant 
of t'liz barony of Kilpeter from oalJwin of Biggar, fhenff of 
Lanark in the reign of Malcolm IV. When families begaa 
to alTuine llrtiames from their hereditary lands and baronies, 
his defcendants may be fuppofed to have afliime: the name 
of Hcw'b town ; and, in procefs of time, might be changed 
into Houftoun One of Hugo de Padv nan's fuccelTors, who 
lived in the reign of King Alexander 111. is called, in an an- 
tient charier. Sir Finlay de Houftoun ; which firnarne con- 
tinued in the family for feveral hundred years. We are alfo 
informed by Mr Crawfurd, that Patrick, one of Hugh de 
Padvinan's fucceflbrs, obtained the honour of knighthood 
from James V. of Scotland ; perhaps a renewal and confir- 
.mation of a former grant of that honour to his predeccffors. 
The barony of Houftoun comprehends the v/hole parilh of 
Houftoun, and a linall part of KiUallan. Before the union 
of the two parilhes, there w.is not a fingle feuer in the pariOi 
and barony of Houftoun. About 50 years ago, it was iold 
to Sir John Schavv of Greenock; and loon after, by him, to 
Sir James Campbell from Jamaica ; and by his heirs to Go- 
vcrnciir Macrae. It has been in the poiTcffion of feveral pro- 
prietors ilncc it went out of the Houftoun fan-illy, and is now 
the properry of Archibald Spcirs, Eli]-, of Elderftie. I he

rally called Strathgryfe, from one of its principal rivers : 
They are bonndtd on the weft by Kilmalcblm ; on the fbuth 
by Kilbarchan; on the north and eaft by the parifh of Er- 
•fkine, vvhicli feparates it from Clyde. It is about 6 Engliflz 
miles long ; about 3 miles broad ; and q miles diihnt from 
Paifley, which is the prefbytery feat. The church of Houf- 
toun is about 9 Scots miles weft of Glafgow, 6 from Port- 
Glafgow, and 8 from Greenock. 

The only confiderable river is Gryfe, which feparates it 
from Kilbarchan on the fouth. Hiis river hath its fource in 
the high moors and mountains that are fituated between Kil- 
malcolm and the Lirgs, on the coaft of the Firth of Clyde. 
It is compofed of icveral ftreams, which unite near the man- 
fion-houfe of Daciial. it runs rapidly, over feveral precipices, 
to the low country at Fallwood, where it meets the tide ; af- 
ter which it moves flowly, in a ferpentlne courie, reccivmg 
the river Black Cart at iVIofs Walkmfhaw, and White Cart 
at Inchinnan bridge, and thence into Clyde, a mile below 
Renfrew. In this river there is trout, moft plenty towards 
the high moors; in the lower part pike and perch; and, with 
the firft flood in June or July, lalmon come up the river from 
Clyde, and ftill more with floods in Auguft, and continue ia 
the river till fpawning time is over. 

Surface and Soil — In the upper part of the united parifhes, 
the loii is genervdly thin and dry, the furface is unevenly mix- 
ed with many wliin rocks in the higheft parts, and much of 
it i- covered with fhort heath and bentgrals, moft fit for paf- 
turing fheep. The foil is better as it defcends toward the 
low country, which is a large plain, of great extent, fro ; the 
manflon-houfe of Barochan and llouftoun, to Glafgow and 
Hair.ilton ; and in breadth, frcia Piifley, and the fo(t of

good, parr clay, part loam, or mixed, and the rents high. 
The manfion-houfe of Barochan Hands on a freellone rock, 
and HouJloun on a whin rock, about one Englifli .ink fronj 
each orher, and both almort on the verge of the plain. There 
is a large mofs in the plain, not far from Barochan, of many 
hundred acres, from which the country all around get peats 
for fuel. 

Air and Climate. — The air in the upper parts of Hoaftoun 
and Killallan is fharp in winter j the inow covering the 
ground when there is Icarce any at Houdoun and iiarochan, 
and none in the plain below ; and the h irveft is often above 
a week earlier at Barochan, Houftfjun, .md along Gryfe to 
Duchal and Kiliualcolm, than in any other part of the Heigh- 
bouring country. 

Wood and Planting. — There is a large natural wood at 
Houftoun, confifting of oak, alder, birch, willow, and fome 
afti ; befides a great quantity of old planted timber about rher 
manfion-houfe, conliffing of elms, planes, afh, limes, and 
fome oaks ; many of which have been lately cut down and 
fold at a good price There is alio a co.ifiderable natural 
wood at Barochan, and another at Eoghall, a fmall barony 
on the north fide of the parifti, the property of Boyd Alex- 
ander, Elqj of South Barr, and was once the feat of another 
family of the name of Fleming. There is alio a great quan- 
tity of planting about tiie man/Ion houfe of Barochan, con- 
fifting of-afli, plane, oak, larch, and fir. 

Population. — Population has lately decreafed in the country 
part of the parifh, by the union of fmall farms. About forty 

years

years ago, there were 1 6 farms in the barony of Fullwood ; 
there are only 8 at prefent. At that time, the yearly rent of 
that eftate was little above 3000 merks ; and, when lately

It has not been cullom iry to keep a regifter of burials in 
.ihe parifhes of Houftoun and Kiilallan. 

The oM village of H uftoun was built near the church and 
manfion-houfi', and confined of about 16 tamiliL-s. All the 
hoiifes in it belonged to the proprietor There was not a 
feu in the whole parilh. It was demoliihed when the New 
Town was built, as was fo-nierly obierved ; only one houfe 
an t the fchoolhoule being lelt ftanding. In the new village are 
35 houfes, all built fmce the year 1781, inhabittd by 57 fa- 
milies, which has made a conliderabk addition to the popula- 
tion of the parifh Six of the houles are tWo Itories high, 
and two of them flateu ; mnny ot them contain two families^ 
or one family and a fliop for looms. No houliss have lines 
been demoliflied of any conlequence. About twelve years 
ago, the manlion houfe on the eltate of Fullwood, which was 
a large, elegant, modern houfe, and made a fine appearance 
in the country, was demol fhed by Mr Speirs of Elderflie, af- 
ter he purchafed that eftate, and entai'ed it. He carried Ibme 
of the beft of the materials to his houfe at King's Inch, and 
fold the rem;iindcr This eftate was for T.erly the property 
of the Porterfields of Fullwood, cadets of the Duch^l family. 
The new village of Houftoun is neatly built \ the front Walls 
are of hewn ftone from the manHon-hovfe and tower of 
Houftoun. There are five corn mills in this parifli, two lint 
and fulling-mills. 

Trades and MatiufaElures — The principal trade in the vil- 
lage IS weaving. There are 42 looms, moft of which are 
employed in weaving cotton, muflins, lawns, and filk gaufe ; 
There are alfo a few carpenters, taylors, and fhoemakers Near 
the village, there is a large bleach field be longing to KirfTrs 
James and Thotnas Carlifles from Paifley, whereon is whiten^*

ed about 50,000 fplndlcs of thread and yarn, and above 300* 
pieces of mnflin and lawn yearly. This and the weaving bu- 
finefs c iufes a c mfiderable circulation of money in the vil- 
lage and neighbourhood. 

Church. Manfe, Glebe, and Stipends.— -The kirk of Killallan 
is ftill ftanding and the roof is entire. I he heritors were im- 
powered, by the decreet of annexation, to lell the nianie, 
which was a bad houfe, and the glebe, to enable them to build 
a church at Houftoun, fufficient to accommodate the inhabi- 
tants of both pariOies. The new church of Hourtoun was 
built in the year 1775 and can acconmiodate with leats 150 
perlons bcfide the parilhiontrs, which is very convenient 
when the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper i-^ dif penfed. The 
glebe at Houftuun is about fix acres of arable land, beiides 
garden, houfe, and outhoufes. The annexed ilipend amounts 
to 66 bolls of oat-meal, 14 bolls of barley, and L 7S Ster- 
ling, of old and new money ftipends. The greateft part uf 
the money ftipends ariles from y2 bolls of oat- meal, con- 
verted by the decreet of annexation at 10 merks per boll, 
being the ufuol converfion at that time ; for which the heri- 
tors now receive 16 s. from the tenants; which' has turned 
cut to be a confiderable diminution of the flipends. This 
was done by a petition from the heritors to the Lords, &amp;c. 
with confent of the prefbytery, becaule a great part of the 
united panfhes is more fit for paffure than tillage, and might 
in time be uied for that purpofe. The above money (fipends 
comprehend L 40 Scots for communion elements. Mr 
Monteath, ordained Feb. i 748, is now paftor of the united 
parilhes. Mr Robert Carrick was lall: miniller of Houftoun 
prtv.ous to the annexation of the parifhes ; he was ordained 
in the year 1720 or 1721, and died May i, 1 771, aged 89 
years, 10 nionihs, and twenty days. 

Schoo!/. 



of Uoufloun and Killallan* 



Sfhools. — The public Ichool is at the church, where read- 
ing tnglifh, writing, arithmetic, book-bee). ing and ionie- 
times Latin, are taught. The number of fcholars are about 
40 or 50 in winter ; but fewer in fummer. There are 
alfo private fchools In different parts of the parifh. 1 he 
fchoolin ifter's falary is 200 merks ; he receives 4 d for a bap- 
tilm, and l s. 2 J. for a marriage proclamation ; and a fmall 
yearly lum as feffion clerk, and for keeping the regiliers, par- 
ticularly an exadt account of the poor's funds. 

Poor. — There is at prefent near 20 poor people who are fup- 
plied from the poor's tu:.ds : Nearly the half of them are old, 
and unable to work : Some of them are poor widows, and f.nall 
children ; others infirm or diieafed. The poor's liock is L. 260 ; 
the interelt of which, with the weekly ccilledtions at the 
church door, is the only means of their iupport at preienr. 
They are regularly lupplied, with more or lels, at the begin- 
ning of each quarter, efpecially the aged and intirm, as lar 
as the money in the hand of the trealurcr will go. 

Inclofures, and Rents of Lands, ^c. — Mofl part of the pa- 
rifh is inclofed ; the upper grounds with flone-wails, and the 
low lands with thorn hedges. The rent of the upper and 
hilly farms is from 10 s. to 15 s. an acre arable; what is 
rocky, and covered with heath, is of fmall value, very fuitable 
for planting the Scotch fir, larch, and oaks, though it is not 
yet applied to that uieful and profitable purpoi'e. The rent 
in the low land, of a clay and loamy foil, is from 20 s. to 
30 s an acre. The upper or hilly farms produce oats, fome 
peale, barley, and good dry potatoes. ihe farms in the 
pl. in and low land produce oat.s, barley, peafe, beans, and 
wheat. The farmers, of late, have left off lowing wheat, 

thinking 



324 Statl/lical Account 

thinking it a troublelo  e and unprofitable crop. They have, 
for many years palt, Town a great quantity of ryegrats ,ind 
clover- feed, which turns to good account ; the hay is com- 
monly lol.i at 5 d. and 6 d. a ftone. I hey have a ready 
markpt for the hay at Greenock, &amp;c. There was no- 
thing but bog, or m adow hay, for horfes about fifty years 
ago. The valuation of the united pariflies of Houftonn 
and Ki!l;illan amounts to L 4057 : H : o Scots. The real 
rent is r e - rly doub c. if not more, than it was years ago. 
The rent of the barony  ( Fullwood at that time was about 
(6 s and 7 s. ;in acre and now there is none of it below 
20 s. I he number of the horfe'; in 'he parifh cannot be well 
alcf-rrained. Far ers, who have only about half a p'oughgate 
of l iid, more or lefs, often kfcp on'y one horfe in fummer, 
buy nother in winter, and hire one to make a three horfe 
plough in the fpring ; and, when the ploughing is over, they 
fell one of them. Their horfes are gen^-rally of a high price, 
viz. froii' 20 to 2 s guineas. I hey buy them young, feed them 
Well, and, after a year or two, fell them to advant-igc. The 
faru.ers who have a pionghgate of land or more keep horfes 
in proporti n to their labour. Cows cannot be faid to be nu- 
merous. A farmer that has half a j loughgate of land will 
have 6, 7, or 8 milk cows, and a few young cattle, in pro- 
portion to their farms. In the hilly and moorilh ground, they 
bring up more young cattle, on coarfe pafture, than in the 
low part of the country, where grafs is ftarce, except vyhen 
fown 1 hert- are not m, ny ihcep in thi.-. panlh, except a 
few in the upper and iijoorilh farms j they hurt the inclolures 
and the milk cows grafs.

one-half of the year Paifley, Port Glafgow, and Greenock,

are conftamly building. The wages of mechanics, day-labour- 
ers, and iervants, are more than double what they were 40 or 
5« years ago. A day- labourer's wages is 1 s. 2d. at leali ; a

vants from L. 7 to L lO a year, if thty are good ploughmen ; 
wcnen-fervants, from L. i ; • o : o or L. 2 the year,

hired fervants if they h.ive not children fit for it, ex- 
cept when they occafionaily employ day labourers for thrrfh- 
jngi or in harveff. Price of fi^- fh meat and poultry is daily

Free and Lime-Jiom, — There is plenty of freeftonc in both 
parifhei., of diftcreni qualities, fbfter and harder, vtry near 
the manfiou-hoide of Barochan and Houfioun. There is 
both coal and liii.eltone in the eftate of Houftoun, buf of a 
hard quality; thr- limeflone is deep in the groiuid, anti ill to 
burn, and is the roof of" a thin coal ; but, when the Ikhc is 
well burnt by a ik;lful hand, though it has iictle efft cl: the 
firft year, its ' ffcdt is more laflmg than letter lime,

nerally fober, an^ regular in attending publir worflilp. The 
farmers- are very induftrious. In the fprins they c L vatc 
their land-, in fumm^r they lead lime and manure; and in 
the hay and corn hirveft times they are bufily employed. 
They are decently clothed, elpecially the women ; many 
of the young won en and girh in rlie village flower lawns 
and mufl ns, by which fht-y not only maintain themfclves, 
but buy fiiienes. About 4c years ago, the fineft drcfs of the 
women, old and young, was brown or blew cloaks, and 
caps ; to whirh fcarlet on^s fucceeded. Scarlet is now worn 
by 'he loweft ami poorei^ peo; \ '. The wonen generally wear 
black filk cloaks, bonne's of various fhapes, and h'gh 
crowned hats, and riduig habits ; and the congregation on ab-

call it a Danifli crofs : Ptrhaps it might be intended as a de- 
votional crol's for travellers. 

Barochan is an antient finiily. The original anccQor of 
that name is faid to have come from Flanders in King Da- 
vid's reign ; and alTumed their lirname and delignation from 
the country of the Flemin s. One of the n is a witnels to a 
charter in the rcign of King Alexander Hi. and to another 
charter in the year 309 In the reii^n of James IV. WiU 
liam Fleaiiiig of Barocnan was iheritf f Lanark, and kilL*d 
with the King, and many of the nobil.ty and gentry, in the 
battle of Floudon. This family has always been much reipec- 
ted in the country. 

The crofs above mentioned was lately removed by Malcolm 
Flemmg, Lfq; the preient proprietor, to a neighbouring hill, 
where the old maiidon houli; of Barochan formerly lloud. 
This houfe is reported to have been burnt by tlie l.nglilh, 
probably in the reign ot King Ldward, and his invahon of 
ijcotlaiid. 

The manfion-houfe of Houftoun was alfo very antient. 
There was a large, and very hij^h tower, on the north weft 
cornc'-, which was the moll antient part of tne building, with 
a lower houfe joined to the eafl end of the tower, with vaults 
below, and a very long and wide paved hall above, with an- 
tiq-iC windows in the front, and without plafter in the roof. 

The timbers of the roof were arched, and made of mafly 
oak. The oiher parts ol the building appeared to be addi- 
tions, fubfequently made as they became receflary It was a 
coniplc'e fqiiare, with a large area in the infide. On the front 
to the louth were two turrets, betwesa which was the grand

328 Stafi/lical Account 

entry into the area, arched above, and iecured by a port cul- 
lis. Tlie huild'ng was a rral fortification ; be ng large, -ind 
built on an elevated fi uation, it had a lordly appearance, 
overlooking the wliole plain towards Patfley and Glalgow. 
About 10 year- ago it was demolillied, except the ealt fide. 
Mr Macrae, who was then the proprietor, deliring to have 
the old village near it removed to a greater diftance, feued 
ground for building a new village; and, to encourage the peo- 
ple to build, he gave them the ftones of the luanfion-houfe 
gratis. The tower was fo thick, and the ftonc and lime fo 
ftron^ly cemented, that they were obliged to bUft it with gun- 
powder. Mr Macrae propofed at that time to build a ntvr 
hou!e for hlmfelf or to make an addition to the fide that was 
then ftanding, and was the newi f^ part of the who.e; but that 
plan was never executed ; and the whole is now a ruin. The 
bii'ldmg is faid to have been originally a religious houle of 
Monks of the Ciflertian order. 

In an a le adjoining to the eaft end of the church are feve- 
ral fepukhral monuments; particularly a magnificent tomb of 
neat v/orknianfhip, in free ftone. In the front, under a cano- 
py, refemhling an alcove bed, are placed two ftatues as big as 
the life: The one is faid to be an effigy of Sir Patrick Houf- 
toun of that Ilk, who died in the year 1450; and the other 
of his lady, Annes Campbell, who died in the year 1455. 
The one reprefenting bir Patrick is drefled in a coat of mail, 
his head lying on a pillow, and his feet on a lion with a wide 
mouth, holding a lamb in his paws ut;der him. i he image 
of the lady is drefl^ed as in grave clothe , neatly cut in flonc. 
Both their hands are elevated, as in a praying or fupplicating 
pofture. Round the verge )f the tomb there is an inlciiption 
in Saxon capitals, but io much effaced, that little of it can be 
diftindly reaa,

the antient nations of So'ith Britain burnt the bodits of the 
dead, according to the pradiice of the antient GaiJs, from 
whom they were delcended ; and tlvat this is U'lqueltionably 
evident from the great number of urns, of Britifh worknian- 
lliip, which have been found m feveral pl ices, lull of afties, 
and human bones half bu^nt ; and thefe urns, with their va- 
rious contents, were depofited m lepulchres, caves, and bar- 
rows or tumuli, according to the prevailing cuftom of the 
cour tryj but, as the bones of men lying at full le.igth, with- 
our any marks of burning, have been found in fome of thelc 
barrows, it appears, that, on fome occafions, the anfcnt Bri- 
tons of the fouth, both of Scotland and Eniland, buried their 
dead witho ;t burning, and that the Caledonians always buried 
their dead in deep graves. 

About 20 years ago, when the country people in this pa- 
rifh were digging for Itones to inciofe their farms, they met 
with feveral chefts or coffins of flag ftones, fet on their 
edges, fides, and ends, and covered with the lame fort of 
ftones above, in which were many human bones of a large 
fize, and leveral fculls in fome of them. In one was found 
many trinkets of a jet black fubftance, fome round, others 
round and oblong, and others of a diamond fhape, &amp;c. all 
perforated. Probably they were a necklace. There was a 
thin piece, about 2 inches broad at one end, and perforated 
with many holts, hut narrow at the other j the broad end, 
full of holes, feemed to be defigned for fufpending many 
trinkets, as an ornament on the breaft. The ground where 
thefe ftone coffins were found was a little raifed, with a mix-

But whether thefe ftone coffins were older than the Ro- 
man government in chis country, or la^er, or upon whui oc- 
cafion (o many peopL' ^vere bu icd there in that mannrr, and 
feveral in one ftone cheft, is not known. It ft'ems to have 
been the confequence of a battle or Ikirmifli betw.en two 
hoftile par les; which was the cafe not 200 ycart ago, oe- 
tween families, through moft part of Scotland, who otfcn 
met their enemy, with their vaifali and dependants, and

Situation^ Extent, and S/ir/ace. 

THE parifh of Biggar, in the county of Lanark, is th^ 
feat of a Prefbytery, a branch of the Synod of Lo- 
thia and • weedd le. It is about 6 miles long from call; to 
Wf ft ; and 31 broad from fouth to north ; the figure being a 
fort of oval, with fome irregularities. The lurface is partly 
hilly, and parrly level ; in fome places heathy, in others 
green, and interfperfed vpith fertile firlds ; and is almoft 
equally divided between tillage and paxlure. 

Rent, — The prefent rental of the parifli may amount 
to about L. 1800. 1 he beft grouneK about the town lets at 
30 s. aiid fome particular fpots yield a rent of 40 s. an acre ; 
but, in general, the land in the neighbourhood of Biggar lets at 
between 20 s and 30 s. an acre, being molUy diltnbuted into 
feveral finall farms of L, 10 and L. 15 each. In the country 
part of the parilh, fome farms let at L. 50, others at L. -o, 
and one at L. i^o^r annum: but the rate per acre cannot 
be eafily afcertained, as they confift moftly of fome tolerably 
good low grounds, and a confiderable extent of hilly poor 
land, which is employed for pafture. There has been no

great alteration of the fize of farms here thefe many years 
paft. The parifh, in general, is open and uninclofed, though 
there are fevcral indofures here and there, efpecially near 
the town. The number of horfes may be about 125, and of 
fheep 100 fcore. There are about 40 heritors in the parifli, 
ind'iding po^tioners of Biggaf town ; Lord Elphinftone being 
the principal proprietor, and Mr Brown of Jldmonltone the 
pnly refident heritor of any confideration. 

Prices of'Provtj^ons atid Lalour. — T?utcher meat generally 
feUfcat 3 d. i \ d. or'4 d. a pound ; butter 7 d. a pound ; hens 
from IS. to IS. 2d.; and chickens 4 d. each. The fuel 
ufed here is coal from Douglas, 1 1 miles off ; 3 loads, or i 
horfe draught, comes to 3 s. 3d.; but lome people \x^e peats 
from Biggar mofs, though thefe are difBcuit to procure, and

This place ftands on a dry and elevated fituation, favoured 
with a loutherly expoiure, and is allowed to be a healthy and 
well aired town ; no houles are unoccupied; ana three new 
ones have been lately built. There ar-r three fairs held here 
yearly, one at Candlemas, another lu ja y, and a third in 
November. 

Church and Stipend. — The collegiate church of Biggar was 
built in 11549, by '^'ialcolm 3d Lord Fleming, Lord High 
Chamberlain of Scotland, and largely endowed by him for 
the fupport of a provoft, 8 prebendaries, 4 finging boys, and 
6 poor men. It is built in the form of a crofs ; the fabric is 
entire; but the rteeple and fpire have never been finilhed. Ie

collections are applied in payii\g their minifters ftip' n  V-eep-

money borrowed. 

Roads. — The public roads in this parifh, and in the county 
in general, are improving every day. About 30 years ago, the 
inhabitants wrought at them a certam number of days in the 
year; while this practice concmue-l, the work was performed 
with relufVancc, and the roads kept in bad repair: But now, 
each taim pays a certair lutn •, and the roads, under the m- 
fpeftion of truflees are well made, and prelerved in excellent 
repair, proper materials besng at hand- I here ii one turn-

    PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3041378">DUNSYRE</name>. 

By the Rev. Mr John Bradfute.</head> 

<p>

Origin of the Name, 

DUNSIR, or Dunfior, in the Celtic, fignlfies the 
Long Hill 5 thence it appears that a remarkable hill, 
called Dunfyre, near the fmall village where the church, 
(lands, has given name to that village, and confequently to 
the pariDi. 

Situation, Extentj and Surface. — This parifli lies at the eaf- 
tern extremity of the county of Lanark, in the prefbytery of 
Biggar, and fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The arable 
land lies between the hill of Dunfyre and the fangc of Dol- 
phington and Walfton hills to the foutl. , which are about 
a mile diftant from the former. Between them is a flat vale, 
extending near three miles in length, through the middle 
of which the fmall river Medwin (the fouthern boundary of 
the parifli) runs in a winding dire£i:ion. The houfes are pla- 
ced between the Medwin and the hill of Dunfyre, and on ri- 
Cng grounds, at the weft extremity of the flat lands, many 
of them In fituations improper for the farms. The reft of 
the parifh is flieep pafturc, ftretching to the north 5 fo thatj 
though the houfes are nearly in a line from eaft to weft, the 

Vol. I» U tt extent 



33^ Siaftjlical Account 

extent of the pariili is about five miles every way ; and it h 
bounded by the par'flies of Carnvvath, Weft Calder, Lintonj 
Dolphington, Walfton, and Libberton. 

Climate and Difeafes. — This parifh is placed very high, 
being about 700 feet above the level of the eaft and weft 
feas, from which Dunfyre is almoft equi-diftant ; io that the 
Medvvin being divided by a mill dam at the eaft end of the 
parifti, one half of the ftream runs to the Clyde, and the o- 
ther half to the Tweed. The air is pretty good, though ra- 
ther moift. The prevalent diftempers are rheumatifm, and 
nervous diforders ; the laft, it is imagined, are partly ow- 
ing to the want of circulation of air in the houfes, the win- 
dows of which formerly had moveable timber leaves below, 
and glafs above, now the windows are fafhed, and fcarcely 
any of them can be opened. 



Population. — On the ift of January 1791, there were in

~o 
By 



of Dun/yre, 339 

By the returns made to Dr Webfter about 1 7^0, th(!re 
were 359 inhabitants then in the parifh, lb that it appears 
•the population has made little or no progrefs in 40 years, 
though it is faid that, about 1783, the number of inhabitants 
was aboMt 400, the decreafe lince that period being owing to 
•the enlargement of farms, and pulling down of cottages. All 
the parifliioners, except about 40 fedaries of various denomi- 
nations, are of the eftabliflicd church ; and, from the regif- 
ters, it appears there were 14 baptiied, and 9 buried, between 
1 ft January 1788 and ift Jauuary 1791. There are in the 
parifli three heritors, none of whom refide, one clergyman, 
twelve farmers, two ftudents, a few weavers, fmiths, mafons, 
Wrights, and taylors, who have about half a dozen appren- 
tices. 

Ecclefmjlical State. — The annual value of the living is 
L. 100, exclufive of the manfe and glebe, which laft may be 
worth L. 10 a year. The King is patron, and the parfon is 
titular of the tythes. The maafe was built in 1756. The 
kirk is old, but in tolerable repair. The number of poor rc- 
-ceiving charity are 7 or S, fupplied by the colledlions, and the 
intereft of a fmall fund of L. 90. 

Natural ProduBlons^ ^c. — In general, there is not much, 
wood in the parifh ; it is chiefly fir, afh, and a few limes. 
Some oats are fent to the Glal'gow market, as arc alfo (heep, 
and turnip fed cattle. The artificial grafl'es are clover, rye- 
grafs, and a little rib-grafs ; the times of lowing and reaping 
are various. In good leafons, the harveft here is three, in a 
wet year fix, weeks later than in Mid or Eaft Lothian. Dun- 

■fyre Hill is rocky and green. The other rifing grounds in 
the parifli are covered with black heath. Peat re produced 

• iji the parifli ; but there is no coal nearer than twelve miles. 

Th?

Stati/lical Account 



The land rent in 1735 was L. 500; it may perhaps be now 
nearly doubled ; and the parifli is divided into twelve farms, 
one of which is wholly flieep pafture. The day-wages of a 
mafon and carpenter are 1 s. 6 d. each ; of a taylor 1 s. ; of 
a day-labourer i s. ; ploughmen get from L. 6 to L. 7, and 
women fervants from L. 3 to L. 4 per annum. The people 
are fober, economical, and induftrious. The fervants are 
well fed and treated ; and, in feed time and harveft, none 
in Scotland can be more alert. The Medwin produces a few 
trouts. 

Antiquities. — ^There is a row of fepulchral cairns running 
from the eaft end of this parifli upon the edge of a muir to- 
wards Linton. Two of them the prefcnt incumbent hn? 
feen opened ; in one the body had been buried in a large 
coffin of feveral unwrought freeftones, in the otfier was found 
a fmall urn. 

Mijcellaneous Obfervaiions.—'Vht foil in the parifli, and 
all that traft of country which ftretches from hence to La- 
nark is in general light and fandy ; the arable land being fre- 
quently interfperfed with, or bordering pn, peat-mofs. The 
foil is well adapted for raiflng turnips and potatoes, though it 
is only of late that the culture ox the former has been intro- 
duced. In general, this tratTt is fliill uninclofed. Jnclofure;, 
with belts and clumps of planting, would much improve the 
parifli, by flieltering the grounds, and meliorating the cli- 
mate. It is a queftion of importance how thefe fences could 
be made at the cheapeft rate. Thorn-hedges ^re impracti- 
cable here, as the foil has many variation? from good to bad, 
where thorns cannot be reared. Stones are not every where 
to be got and, befides, the poverty of the ground will hardly 
bear the expence of erefting ftone-walls. Perhaps turf-dykes, 

weU 



of Bunfyre, 34 1 

well coped, is the only mode that can be adopted ; thefe will 
Hand to rear a verge of fir-trees until they are pretty much 
out of danger from being deftroyed by cattle and, if the 
outer-row of the belts were planted thick with larch, which 
is a hardy fort of wood, this of itfelf would be a good fence, 
and fupply the place of the turf dykes when they begin to 
fail. Upon the whole, nothing can be done efFeftually for 
the improvement of this country without draining and fcreen- 
jng. Perhaps the rents might be thus raifed one-third in 
twenty years time. The gentlemen of this part of the coun- 
try feem to have no idea of building villages, though, as fuel 
)s plenty, they might be foon peopled.

Name, Situation, and Extent. 
iRE antlent name of this parifli was Bothons, when the 



JL feat of the family of TwcedJale was at tlie old caftle, 
about a mile from their prefent refidence ; but, after the Re- 
formation, the family left the caflle, and began to build the 
houfe they now inhabit, which they then called Yeflier, and 
the parifla has ever fince gone by the fame name. This pa- 
rifh is fituated in the county of Eafl: Lothian, prefbytery of 
HadJington, and fynod of Lothian and Tweeddale, being 
bounded by the parifhes of Haddington on the north, Gar- 
vald on the eafl:, Lauder on the fouth, and Bolton on the 
weft. It extends about two miles in breadth, and three in 
length, without reckoning that portion which makes part of 
Lammer-moor, and extends two miles further to the fouth- 
Virard. From the foot of Lammer-law, to the northern boun- 
dary of the parifh, the country has a very gentle defcent ; and 
from eafl: to wefl: it Is moftly plain ; Lammer-moor is covered 
with heath. 

Soil and Climate. — The foil is very different ; in the fame 
farm, we have rich good land and very poor ground inter- 
mitted together j but, by means of liip.e and dung, the great- 




eft 



6f TeJlcr. 343 

eft part of the parifli has been brought hito very good order. 
Some of the beft ground is near the foot of Lammer-moor 
hiils ; the moft of the arable land is rather a lhallcw than a 
deep foil. The air is pure and very healthy ; and no parti- 
cular diftemper is prevalent in the parifli ; though it has been 
obferved that, of late years, confuniptions have been more fre- 
quent than ufnal in this part of the country. 

Natural ProduElions. — The hill ground is about two miles 
fquare, and the number of acresr of arable land is about 4000, 
of which near 2000 acres are employed in raifing corn and 
roots, and in fallcrvr. There are fowii about 2co bolls of 
wheat, !•/ 00 bolls of oats, 200 bolls of barley, j 80 bolls of 
peafe, 120 acres of turnips, 100 acres of potatoes, from 15 to 
20 acres of flax ; but this laft- is not much cultivated here, the 
ground not being fit for it. There are often 1 80 acres of fal- 
low, which is fown down with wheat and barler. Much more 
grain is raifed than the people can confume: Mucli is fold in 
Haddington market ; and a confiderable quantity goes yearly 
to the wefl: country. More than one-half of the ground in the 
parifli is in pafture and Town grafs about 200 acres are cover- 
ed with wood, fuch as elm, oak, beech, and fir; among which 
are fome of the largeft and rnof!; beautiful trees in Scotland. 
One oak-tree in the wood of Yeftcr was valued fome years agc 
at L. 25. A good nuuiber of flieep, and, of late years, a num- 
ber of calves are bred in the parifli. Some tenants rear in 
one year about 20 calves each. There may be, of faddle and 
work-horfes, about 200, black cattle about -600, and 140 Icore 
of flieep. Ihe ufluil time of lowing is the beginning of March, 
and of reaping the beginning of September. 

Prices of Provifions. — Beef fells at Martinmas for 3 d. and 
in fpring at 4 d. a pound, and mutton bears liiuch the

to the feafon j lamb from i s. to 2s. 6d. a quarter; pork, in 
general, 4 d. a pound ; geefe 3 s. each ; ducks i s. ; chicken? 
5 d. to 6 d. a pound each ; butter 8 d. to 9 d. and cheefe 5 d. 
to 6 d. a pound. The price of oat-meal 40 years ago was 7 d. 
the peck, at prefent it is i s. A greater quantity of beef and 
mutton are now confumed by the lower clafs of peopk than 
formerly. The fuel commonly ufcd is coal and wood ; the 
former comes from fix miles diftance ; one cart, holding fix 
loads, cofts 2 s. at the hill, and the carriage comes to 3 ». 
more. 

Prices of Lahitr. — The wages of an ordinary man.fervant 
40 years ago were L. 2 : 10 : o yearly; at prefent they are 
from L.5 to L. 7. Women- fervants then received L. i : 10 : o, 
all articles included ; now they have, on an average, L. 3 a 
year. Forty years ago, the wages of a labouring man, who 
received no victuals, were 5 d. through the winter, and 6 d. 
in fummer; now they are raifed to 10 d. in winter, and i s. 
jn fummer ; in harveft, the reapers get from 9 d. to i s. 4 d. 
with their meat. A carpenter makes is. 6d. j a mafon is. 8d. ; 
and taylors have from 6 d. to 8 d. a day, with their meat. 
The common labourer, when well employed, may gain from 
L. 1 5 to L. 1 8 a year, which makes him and his family live 
very comfortably ; and a common ploughman may earn, in- 
cluding meal, corn, and cow, &amp;c. from L. 1 3 to L. 1 5 a year. 

Retit of Land and Houfes, is'c. — ^The land rent of the whole 
parifti amounts to about L. 2000 per annum. A common cot- 
tage lets at about 13 s. or L. l per annum ; if the houfe 
confifts of two er nnore apartments, the rent is L. i. for each 
apartment, when occupied feparately. There are about 150

fouls on an average. The village of Gifford contains about 
400 people, moftly fmall fucrs ; the other villages are but 
trifling. There are about (Jo ploughs in the parifii, which 
are drawn by 2 horfes each ; about 65 carts, feme drawn by 
2 horfes, and fome by 1 horfc ; no waggons ; i coach \ 3 
four-wheeled, and 3 two-wheeled carriages. 

Population. — khowX. 1750, the returns from hence to Dr 
Webfter was 1091 : At prefent there are about 800, from 
5 years of age to 90 ; the number of males and females 
being nearly equal ; the latter rather preponderating. The 
births, on an average, are abont 25, deaths about 15, and 
marria^s about •8, every year. 'I'iie parilli was mucii more 
populous 1 00 years ago than it is now ; the caufes oi' the de- 
creafe muft be attributed to the demolition of cottage^, and 
tiie union of feveral fmall farms into orie •, but the population 
has rather increafed (ince the prefent Marquis of Twecddale 
came to refide at Yeftcr. I Kere are about 5 children on an 
average in a family : The children, in general, are not To 
fiout as they were 40 years a^o; which muft be owing, in a 
great meafure, to the different manner of living, as the com- 
mon people now drmk a great deal of tea, and not good 
fmall beer, which they did j,o years ago. 

In the parifh are 5 heritors, all of whom refide either con- 
Aantly, or occafionally ; i clergyman; 1 phyfician; \ ftudent 
of divinity ; 1 8 farmers ; a good many carpenicrs, mafou;-', 
and weavers, who have all plenty of work through the fea- 
Ibn, and live very coniforcably j 18, male, and 22 female 
houfehold fervants ; 30 female, and 80 male labouring fer- 
vants, moft of which laft are married, and have families. 
There is not one lawyer or attorney in the v/hcL- pariQi ; and 
die people make it their ftudy to keep their atf'airs as much

out of the hands of fuch men as poflible, referring all their 
differences to be determined by the arbitration of neighbours. 
All the inhabitants are of the Eftablifhed Church, except 10 
Seceders. 

Church and Stipend — The church and manfc were built in 
1708. Ihe value of the living, indudmg the glebe, is about 
li. 100 a year, with a good rnanle and garden. The Marquis 
of Iweeddale is patron. 

Poor. — The number of poor in this parifh are from 28 to 
32, each of whom receive from 20 s. to L. 3 yearly , The 
colleftions at the church doors amount to about L. 18 ; the 
profits of the mort-cloths, and other cafualties, from L. 10 to 
L. 12 a year; 13 acres of land belonging to the parifh yield 
an annual rent of i,. 1 1 ; and a mortihcation of L, 100 by the 
late Marchionefs of Twceddak L 5 ; f o that from L. 40 
to L. 45 is diftributed among the poor yearly. About 
1750, tiiere appears to have been much the fame number of 
poor on the lift, who received about L. 2&amp; per a?imim. All 
the poor are fupported in their own houfes, as in that cafe 
they are much happier, and do much more work, than if 
crowded together m work houles. There is a Dii'penfary for 
diftributi.'g niedicnes, and givmg medical advice to the poor, 
gratis : which inltitution is of great benefit to the country. 

^lijtellaneous Ohjervations — There is in the parifh a fjnaij 
river called GitFord V/ ater, in which are fome very fine 
trout : This ftream was remarkable for a flood on the 4th of 
October 1775, which carried down moft of the bridges in 
the parifhj and a number of trees from Yefter ; a mof}- unac- 
countabk' circumltance, as no extraordinary quantity of rain 
had prcvioufly fallen. Ihe people are in general very induf-

trious, having plenty of all kinds of labour. Their Cze varies 
from 5 feet 5 inches to 6 feet 2 inches. There are no ma- 
nufactures in the pariih except a bleachfield, which employs 
about 15 hands in the fummer. The fcarcity in 1782 had no 
particular effeft on the parifii. The heritors then bought 
meal at the market price, and fold it for 2 d. or 3 d the peck 
lower to fuch as were on the poor's lift, or had fmall families. 

Eminent Men. — This parifli has given birth to two emi- 
nent living charaiHiers, Br John Witherfpoon Prefident of

Situation, ^'c. 

'n^^HIS parifh lies in the county and Prefbytery of Linh'th- 
gow, and makes part of the Synod of Lothian and 
Tweeddale. It is 7 miles long, fr.5m eaft to weft, and 2 miles 
broad, from north t6 fouth ; being bounded by the parifhes 
of Terphichen,' Linlithgow, Ecclefmachen, Uphall, Living- 
llone, Whiteburn, and Shotts. Towards the north-eaft, the 
parifh is high and hilly : Bathgate hills, v/hich arc covered 
with green, are a continuation of Cuckold Roy and Cairrr 
Naple in the parifh of Linlitligow, and are fome of the high- 
efi: grounds in this part of the country. Towards the fouth- 
eaft, fouth, and weft, this diftrid is flat, arid almoft level. 

Soil. — About the foot of Bathgate hills, the foil is good, 
and tolerably dry 5" on the fouth and weft fides of the town 
t)f Bathgate, which flands on a fteep flope, the ground is 
bleak and wettifh, but not unhealthy ; nor arc there any par- 
ticular difeafes to which the people are liable. The foil, in' 
general, is pretty deep ; and neither fo fertile as the country 
lying eaftwsrd, nor fo barren as that lying to the weft and 
fouth. 

Minerii/s. 



of Bathgate, 349 

Minerals — A confiderable quantity of free-ftone, of various 
quality, is dug from open quarries in the parilh. A lime- 
ftone rock, thirty feet deep, the property of the Earl of Hope- 
toun, Mr Marjoribanks, and ^ir Paterfon Shairp, , affords ex- 
cellent lime; 20 hands are ufiially employed in the quarry, 
and burning lime. Several kmds of ipar, and fhells of va- 
rious forts, are fometimes met with in it. A rmall:V€in of 
lilver ore was found in this rock a few years ago, but it was 
too inconfiderable to bear the expence of working. .A large 
field of iron-ftone, of a fuperlor quality, was lately wrought 
by the Carron Company in the lands of Barbachlaw, in this 
parifh. There is abundance of coal in feveral parts of this 
diftri(ft. In one of Lord Hopetoun's collieries near Bathgate, 
there are feven different Teams of coal, from leven inches to 
feven feet thick; the deepeft feam, at prefcnt, is 40 fathom 
deep. In this work 20 coal miiiers are conflantly employed ; - 
each of whom works from 15 to 25 loads a dcTy. The load 
is 12 Linlithgow pecks, and fells on the hill at 6 d. the great, 
and d d. the fmall coal. The whole number fupported by 
this colliery, including miners, bearers, &amp;c. is 95 ; of whom 
30 are children incapable of working. There is, be fides, an 
inexhauftible quantity of mofs in the pariflis fo that many of 
the farmers and cottagers burn peat, at leafl: in part. 'I he 
great increafe of the village of Bathgate fince 1750 has been 
chiefly owing to the collieries ; to which caufe, alio, muft be 
attributed the great influx of poor into this town and neigh- 
bourhood. 

Agriculture, ^c. — Oats, barley, peafe, beans, turnips, po- 
tatoes, cabbages, flax, and lometimes carrots, are the chief 
produce of the parifli. Nearly about two-thirds of the 1200 
or 1300 acres of arable land in the parifli are fown with oats ; 
the reft moftly with barley, peaie, beans, and potatoes; wheat, 

turnips. 



3^0 Statijlical Account 

turnips, &amp;c. arc only in fmall quantities. The barley harveft, 
in ordinary years, begins about the latter end of Auguft, or 
beginning of September; and the peafe, beans, and oats, im- 
mediately follow ; the produce being generally fix for one„ 
There may be between 400 and coo acres of hay from fown 
grafs, as alfo confiderable pieces of natural meadow in the 
parifti ; the laft is generally cut about the beginning of Au- 
guft, and the former early in July, Moft kinds of trees which 
ufually grow in Scotland are to be found here ; fuch as the 
afh. elm, beech, oak, and the different forts of firs. In the 
parilh are about 320 milch cows, 700 young and old black 
cattle, 250 horfes fit for labour, about 60 more from i to 3 
years old, and not above 200 fheep. 

Rent of Land. — There are 68 ploughgates in the parllh* 
Many of the farms are let at between 10 s. and 15 s. an acre; 
fome at 20 s. ; and feveral fmall inclofures of 10 or 12 acres 
are let, on leafes of 19 years, at 50 s. and 55 s. an acre. The 
number of farms have diminiflied of late, two or three being 
fometimes let to one perfon, or kept in the proprietor's own 
hands. Hence, in fome places, there is not a lixth part of 
the inhabitants there were 20 years ago. A confiilerable por- 
tion of the parifh is incloled ; and feveral eftates have chan- 
ged their proprietors within the laft 20 years. The price of 
land is from 20 to 25 years purchafe ot the free rent. 

PrL'fs of Provifions. — The prefent price of beef, mutton, 
lamb, and pork, is 35 d. a piaund, Dutch weight ; the two 
former often rife to 4d. per lb. and the laft is but juft begin- 
ning to come into general ufe in this part of the country. A 
fucking pig is ulually fold for as many fhiihngs as h is weeks 
old. Hens and ducks coft from i s. to is. 6d ; chickens 
6 d. to 8 d. ; and geefe 2 s. 6 d. to 3 s, each-, cheefe fells from 

4 s. 



cj Bathgate. 351 

49. to 4 s. 6 d. aftone; and butter from 8 d. to lod. a 
pound: Thele latter articles, fuch as hens, &amp;c. are nearly 
(double; and beef and mutton at leaft a third dearer than they 
were 30 or 40 years ago. Excepting mutton and lamb, the 
parifh is abundantly able to fiipply itfelf with provifions ; and 
there is ufually a confiderable quantity of beef, barley, butter, 
and cheefe, fent out of it. At Bathgate, there is a reguhi" 
flefli market twice a week. 

Prices of Labour. — Day labourers wages are i s. a day \ 
malons, carpenters, and bricklayers from i s. 6d. to i s. 8 d.; 
taylors, when they work out of their own houfcs, 8 d. and 
viftuals. A man who can hold the plough •ivell, and mow, 
&amp;c. will receive L. 8, or perhaps L. 9 and the ordinary 
wages of men fervants for threfhing, carting, &amp;c. is about 
L. 7 a year. They ufually have their viduals in the houfe, 
or, inftead of them, two pecks of oat-meal, and 6 d, 
for kitchen * weekly. The female fervants for hufbandry 
have generally L. 3 for their yearly wages ; and it is the 
common practice, with very few exceptions, to hire fervants 
by the half year. The domeftic and farm fervants in gentle- 
mens families have, perhaps, from L. i to L. 2 a year more 
than thofe employed by farmers. The farmers, in general, 
keep no domeftic fervants, except, perhaps, Ibmetimes one 
woman in harveft, employing their children in the buGnefs 
of the farqi, both within and without doors. 

Impkmei-.ts of Hufbandry. — The plough nnlverfally ufed, 
i'ill within the laft two or three years, was the old Scottifh 
plough, drawn by 4, 6, and fometlmes 8 cattle ; 2 of which, 
when there were 6, and often 4, when there were 8, were 

oxer;, 



f See this word explained la a former note, page 218. 



352 Siait/lical Account 

oxen. Small's chain plough, drawn by 2 horf« and 2 oxen, or 
by 1 horfes, or by 2 oxen alone, is now beginning to be ufed; 
and, where it is drawn onl/ by 2, there is i'eVlovn any driver. 
There are no waggons ; and only 2 four-wheeled chaifes in 
the parifti. 

Pepulaihn. — The population has advanced confiderably 
within thefe 40 years. The returns to Dr Webfter, about 
1750, were 1594 inhabitants j at prefcnt they are 2309 j 984 
males, and 1325 females; making an increafe, fince that pe- 
riod, of above 700. About 1400 people refide in the village 
of Bathgate, and 900 in the country part of the parifh ; in 
the former are 327 married couples, and 1 13 unnaarried per- 
fons who keep houfe ; and in the latter are 122 married 
couples. In the 20 years preceding January 1790, it appears 
there were 1 142 bnptifed, and 771 buried; and for 10 years 
preceding January 1734, there were 4 i 5 baptlled ; making 
an annual average of 4 li births in the latter cafe, and, in the 
former, of 57to births, and 38;^ dearhs. There are about 
21 marriages every year, and each marriage may produce 
about 5 children. Of the 2309 inhabitants, 1989 attend the 
Eltabl'ftied Church ; about 320 are Seceders ; and 3 are of 
the Epifcopal perfiiafion. In the phrifli are 27 heritors, 10 
of whom refide ; 2 clergymen, (the eftablifhed minifter, and 
the paftor of a Burgher congregation)-, 4 furgeons ; 3 writers^ 
about 1 2 years ago there was only i writer, and he had lefs 
bufinefs than any one of the three now has ; 7 merchants or 
fiiopkeepers ; 2 ftudents of divinity, and i o£ medicine; 255 
mechanics, of whom 50 are apprentices j 55 farmers, in each 
of whofe fa milies there are, at an average, 9 or 10 perfons. 
pi whom 3 are generally hired fervants.

chalders of vi£lual. The church was built in J 739 ; the manfe 
is an old building, frequently wanting repairs. The Earl of 
Hopetoun is patron. 

Poor. — The number of poor who fficeive alms from the 
parifh is 48, which is a much finaller number than ufual. 
The funds that fupport them arife from the colleflions at 
the church doors, fees for proclamation of banns, and for the 
mort-cloths ; and from a general afleiTment of the parifh, 
which, ever fincc 1783, has been nearly, and fome years con- 
fiderably above, L. 100 per annum, owing to the confequen- 
ces of the fcarcity in 1782, as will be immediately mention- 
ed. 

Famine in 1782. — In the year I782, the fcarcity of graiti 
\vas fo great, that oat-meal fold for no iefs than L. 2 : 2 : o 
the load (16 ftone). Not only the ordinary poor, but the fa- 
milies of many labourers who were before decently fupported, 
muft have perilhed for want, without extraordinary affiftance. 
Notwithftanding all that was done for them, many of them 
accumulated fo much debt, that, in 1783, they were in little 
lefs diftrefs than in 1782. That public calamity was follow- 
ed by feveral important confequences to this parifh. Many 
were then admitted upon the poor's lift, who before that pe- 
riod fupported themfelves, but ever afterwards they have 
needed affiHiance. For the immediate relief of the poor, the 
parochial fund, amounting to about L. 200, was fpent in 
buying meal, which was given to fome, and fold at a low 
price to others. In confequence of the increafed number of 
neceffitous perfons, and the want of the intereft of the L. 200, 
a heavy annual afleffment was laid on the parifh ; and, fince 
this took place, the coUeflions at the church door do not

amount to a third of their former ufual fum. For eleven 
years preceding December 1783, the average of the difburfe- 
ments for the fupport of the poor, not including the intereft 
^f the L. 200 above mentioned, was L. 5 1 per annum ; but 
for fix years following that period, the annual fum difburfed 
amounted, on an average, to above L. 137. 

Village of Bathgate. — In the village of Bathgate are about 
469 houfes, or rooms, occupied by feparate families, whereof 
29 are uninhabited. The total rental of the town, gardens^ 
and fome fmall pieces of ground, amounts to L. 619 : 14 ;o 
j^er annum ; and the mean rent of a Iwufe or room comes to 
20 s. a year. Bathgate was part of the extenfive poffeflions 
given in 13 16 by King Robert Bruce, as the dowry of his 
daughter Lady Margery, to Walter, High Steward of Scot- 
land, who had one of his principal refidences at this place, 
where he died in 1328 ; Some traces of his manfion may yet 
be feen in the middle of a morafs or loch about a quarter of 
a mile diftant from the town j and feveral caufeways leading, 
to it ftill remain. Hewn ftones have been frequently dug 
from the foundation of it, as alfo fome kitchen utenfils of 
copper or brafs ; and feveral cofirns of flag ftones, in fome of 
which were copper coins, have lately been ploughed up vx 
the adjacent grounds. 

Foody and Expences of LaBourers-. — The common people here 
fubfift on oat meal, peafe meal, barley, potatoes, milk, chiefly 
butter milk, greens, a little butter and cheefe, fomerimes the 
offals of beef, mutton, lamb, or veal, or a fmall piece of beef, 
and, on a particular occafion, a leg- of lamb or veal. For 
three quarters of the year, potatoes conftitute nearly two- 
thirds of the food of a labouring man's family. It is not cafy 
to ftatc the cxpencc of fuch a family ; but it is a faft not to 

be 



355 



be difputed, that upon 5 s. a week, (for until very lately they 
had no higher wages), and what the wife could earn, which, 
at an average, could not be above 2 s. a week, many of them 
have brought up families decently. They have not only pro- 
vided food and raiment for themfelves and 3, 4, or 5 chil- 
-drec, but have paid for teaching their fons to read, write, 
and fometimes arithmetic, and their daughters to read, and 
often to few and write. 

Advantages and Difadvanioges. — ^Thc parllh, in general, ha« 
many, perhaps more advantages within itfelf than moft other 
pariflies, and the people are in general induftrious, oecono- 
mical, happy, and contented with their fituation '. But ftill 
much might be done to better their circumftances, were fuch 
branches of manufadurc as the place is calculated for, efta.. 
bli(hcd and carried on by perfons of experience, ability, and 
fpirit. The only manufaftures at prefent arc a brick and 
tile work, and a tannery, all on a fmall fcale ; befide a tallow 
chandler who carries on a pretty confiderable trade. About 
20 hands are employed in thefe branches. 

Alterations in the Mcnner of Living. — A great alteration in 
the manner of living has taken place in this parifh within the 
laft 40 years. About 1750, there wer^* not above 1 o fami- 
lies who ufed tea, and now, perhaps, there is not above twice 
that number who do not ufe it. Butcher meat was then 
not more ufed than tea:: Scarcely any cattle or fheep were 
killed, except at Martinmas, when fome families ufed to fait 
a whole, or others only a part of an ox or cow, to ferve for 
winter provifion * j but now there is a regular flefli market 
twice a week, and almoft every family, who can afford it, eats 
fiefh conftantly. A much greater quantity of wheaten bread is

now confumed in the parifli in a month, than was in a twelve-, 
rnonth forty years ago. The alteration in drefs fince 1 750 is alfo 
remarkable. When the good man and his fons went to kirk, 
market, wedding, or burial, they were clothed in a home 
fpun fuit of freezed cloth, called keli^ pladden hofe, with a 
^)lue or brown bonnet ; and the good wife and her daughters 
were drefled in gowns and petticoats of their own fpinning, 
with' a cloth cloak and hood of the fame, or a tartan or red 
plaid. But now, the former, when they .go abroad, wear 
fuits of Englifla cloth, good hats, 5cc. ; and the latter the fineft 
printed cottons, and fometimes filk gowns, Clk caps, and bon- 
pets, of different fhapes, Czcs, and colours, white ftockings, 
cloth fhoes, &amp;c. 

Roads The turnpike road leading from the iron works 

at Cleugh to Borrowftounnefs runs through the parifli, as 
3lfo a branch from the great road between Edinburgh and 
Glafgow by Whitburn. Confidering the great number of 
coal and lime carts daily on them, the roads are in pretty good 
order. They were originally made, as well as kept in repair, 
moftly by the ftatute labour, which is fomepmes commuted, 
but chiefly cxadled in kind, at the difcretion of the overfeer. 
Each ploughgate of land is obliged to work at the rate, or 
pay 12 s. per annum ; and the village of Bathgate pays a con- 
fiderable fum for repairing the roads, though the ftreets of 
«he town are in very bad order.

Siiuaiion, and Defcriptlon of the Town and Loch. 

STRANRAER, a royal borough, and the feat of a pref- 
bytery of the fame name. It is governed by a provoft, 
two bailies, a dean-of-guild, and fifteen counfellors, and is the 
chief town of that diftridt of Wigtonfliire, called the Rhyns, 
comprehending the maritime parillies of Kirkmaiden, Stony- 
kirk, Inch, Glenluce, Stranraer, Fort Patrick, Lochfwalt, 
Kirkholm, and the moorland parifh of Newluce. The town 
of Stranraer is Ctuated at the head of Lochryan. As to the 
origin of the name, little but conjecture can be advanced ; 
yet, as all this country was comprehended in the antient 
kingdom of Galloway, and inhabited by a tribe of Celts, it is 
probably of Gaelic origin. Lochryan, on which the town 
ftands, is a moft beautiful, as well as a fafe and commodious 
bay. It is about lo Englifh miles long from north by weft 
to fouth by eaft ; the entrance into it is nearly two miles 
broad ; it is bounded on the eaft by the parifh of Ballan- 
trae, in Airftiire ; and on the weft by Millar Point, a head- 
land, or promontory, in the parifli of Kirkholm. About 
three or four miles from the mouth of the loch, on the eaft 
fide, is the little village of Cairn, belonging to Mr Dunlop of 

DunIo|), 



358 Statiflical Account 

Dunlop. Contiguous to this village is a very fafe and com- 
inodious bay, with good anchoring ground, and depth of wa- 
ter fufiicient for ihips of any burden j and all veflels entering 
into, or conaing out of the Frith of Clyde fly to it for fheltcr 
from ftorms. King William's fleet anchored here in their 
paflage to Ireland. OppoGte to the village of Cairn, in the 
Kirkholm fide, a fand bank, called the Scar, runs a confider- 
able way croft the loch from N. W. to S. £. To prevent 
their running foul of this bank, veflels keep pretty near the 
caft fhore. Few accidents have ever happened on this bank. 
It even contributes confiderably to the fafety of the fouthern 
part of the bay, breaking the force of the tide by the direc- 
tion in which it lies. This bank abounds with oyfters of a 
moll excellent flavour. They are found indeed all round 
the Ihores, and might be got in great quantities would people 
drag for them. At prefent they are only gathered at low 
water, in fpring tides, for a few months in the fpring. Loch- 
ryan immediately fpreads out, on both fides, into a very beau- 
tiful circular figure, extending about four miles in breadth. 
25efides the Cairn Bay, there are feveral other good anchor- 
ing bays in the loch ; fuch as Portmore Bay, a little within 
the loch on the weft fide ; the Wig, juft on the weft fide of 
the Scar ; the Bay of Solcburn, at the mouth of a little rivu- 
let of the fame name, about two miles fouth of the Scar ; 
and the Bay of Dalmennock on the eaft fide, about two miles 
above the Cairn. In fhort, the anchoring ground is good, and. 
fafe every where through the whole loch. A variety of fifli, as 
ikate, flounders, fmall cod, haddocks, whitings, lobfters and 
crabs, and fometimes turbot, are caught within the loch. Be- 
tween the mouth of the loch and the Rock of Ailfa, and to 
the weft of Millar Point, along the Ihores of Kirkholm, the 
jcods and haddocks are larger, and of a moft excellent quali- 
fy But thcfe filhing grounds, lying at 12 or 15 roUcs from 

the

tlic town, can only be reforted to in calm fettled weather j 
hence the inhabitants are not fo well, or fo regularly fupplied 
with fifh, as might be expefted from the fituationof the town. 
The herring fifliery ftiall be mentioned afterwards. Stran- 
raer has no artificial harbour. Ships of 300 tons burden can 
come to what is called the Road, about half a mile from the 
town. VeiTels of 60, even of 1 00 tons, frequently anchor 
clofc by the houre3. At high fpring tides the water rifes at 
the town i© feet perpendicularly, and retires along a gently- 
declining, Tmooth, fandy beach, to about a quarter of a mile's 
diftance. The anchorage is good and fafe every where, A 
ftrong N. or N. W. wind, accompanied with a high tide, 
arc the only circumftances that can, in the lead degree, en- 
danger veflels anchoring in the road, or near the town. The 
town is divided, nearly in the middle, by a little rivuiet, over 
which there are feveral ftone bridges. The caftle, now un- 
inhabited, is 3 whin-ftone building, with free-ftone' corners 
and windows, of confiderable height, and ftill very fubftan- 
tiaL The handfome town-houfe and prifon, built abouc 
eighteea years ago, with the many new houfes built within 
the fame time, and well finifhed, add greatly to the beauty of 
the ftreets. New houfes, finilhed in a ftyle that would not 
difgrace even fome of our richer and more populous towns^ 
are riling every year, and demonflrate tae increafing opulence 
and tafte of the inhabitants. The fituation of the town is- 
cfleemed very healthy j and the good health commonly eii- 
joyed by the inhabitants fully juftifies this opiaion. The vnt^ 
ter, though drawn from wells, is good j the air pure, and 
free from fogs ; the wititers generally mild, except when the 
wind blows from the N. or N. W. The laborious part of 
the inhabitants, expofed to the feverity of many a winter's

matic pains. The progrefs and ravages of the fmall pox have 
been much checked by inoculation, which is frequently prac- 
tifed both in the town and in the country. Many of the in- 
habitants have reached the age of eighty and ninety years and 
upwards. 

Trade and F'tJJyeries. — In the year 1 764 there were only 
two veflels belonging to the town, of 30 or 35 tons each •, 
but now the tonnage of the port is about 1 200 tons, compo- 
fed of veflels from 1 5 or 20 to 1 00 tons each •, there is one of 
upwards of 150 tons. This fliipping is generally employed 
in the different branches of the coafting trade, and in the 
herring filhery. This laft branch of trade was pufhed with 
great fuccefs for many years by the inhabitants of Stranraer ; 
but, for the laft feven or eight years, they have been greatly 
difcouraged by want of fuccefs. Laft fcafon, only fix or feven 
vefTels went to the Highland fifliery, and returned with very 
poor cargoes ; fome with only 3 or 4 barrels ; and none with 
more than a quarter cargo : Formerly 1 6 or 17 veflels have 
gone out and returned full laden. Befides the coafting trade 
and fifhery, fome of the largeft veflTels have lately gone an- 
nually to Norway, Gottenburgh, and the Baltic, either on 
freight, or on account of their owners here. Confiderable 
quantities of deals, plank, large timber, and iron have been 
imported. Thefe articles are difpofed of in the country 
and town for building, &amp;c. ; a great part of them is em- 
ployed in fhip-buildlng. The herring fifliery in Lochryan 
•was formerly very confiderable : Boats and bufl!es flocked thi- 
ther in great numbers from every quarter, the inhabitants of 
every defcription found employment, and wealth poured in 
upon them. The fifhery is now much decreafed. The her- 
rings make their appearance generally fome time in Septem- 
ber, continue two or three months, appearing and difappear- 

ing 



of Stranraer, 



ing at intervals. They yield a fcanty and temp'^rary fup ply- 
to the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood. What is 
caiiyht anfwers preient demand, but could not be offered to 
fak in any foreign market. 

Stranraer, being the chief town of the diftri^l, is reforted 
to by the inhabitants of the neighDouriug parilhes for iu( Ii 
neci-ffaries and comforts of life, as their farms cannot furniili, 
their fancies may demand, or their puries afford. Tnere are, 
however, too many retailers of whiiky, both licenled and un- 
licenled The effects of it arc the iame here as every where 
elle, VIZ idlenefs, and the ruin of the health and morale of 
the lower fort of people. 24,426 gallons of whifky, and o- 
ther Britifh Ipirirs, were imported mco this piace in the courfe 
of the year 1 790 ; and it has been afferted as a tait, that, in 
the courfe of the lame year, near L 5000 titcning was drawn 
from this town and the neighbour.ng panihcs for whilky a- 
Io'jc. The health and morals of the people, and the pupula- 
tioii of the country, all .f which are hurt by the pernicious 
habit of dram-driiikiiig, are of inhnaely more importance to 
a ftate than the produce of the tax. 

The fpirit of improvement, akho' only lately introduced into 
this country, advances rapidly About 60,000 Larlifle bulliels of 
lime (each bufhel conla nung three W inchefter bulhelsj, were 
imported into this diilriit latt' year from Larne and White- 
haven ; for there is no lim Hone in the country. The quan- 
tity commonly laid on an acre is 51; or 60 Carlifle bufhels ; 
the price at the fhore 13, 14, or 1 5 pence a bufliel ; hence 
weighty crops of barley, oats, rye-grals, and clover, are raifed, 
where, not many years ago, weak grey oats could fcarcely be 
feen, ^^ome judgment of the ftate of agriculture in this di-

Tanning is a confiderable trade here. There are two annual 
fairs in the parilh ; one in the beginning of May, the other in 
the beginning of September. While a friendly coiintdlion 
fubfifted between Great Britain and America, great quantities 
of Galloway plaiding (a courfe fabric, fitted for the Virginia 
market) was fold at the lail of thefe fairs. This was the 
llaple manufacture here ; and it brought into the country 
near L. 3000 annually But the demand for this article cea- 
fing at the commencement of hoftilities, the trade was aban- 
doned. To it has fucceeded the raifing of flax in greater 
cjuantlties than formerly, and working it np into courfe linens.

No unfavourable conclufion muft be drawn from the ftate

of the manufadturers, who is well known to have ftamped a 
confiderable quantity of linen, being from home, the amount 
of his produce is omitted in the account for 1 790. 

The farmers generally export their corn, which produces 
very ferious conlequences to the inhabitants, as they are obli- 
ged to purchafe meal at the difcretion.iry price of the Idler. 
To remedy this fore evil, about twenty years ago, a number 
of mechanics, countenanced by many of the more refpeftable 
and wealthy inhabitants, formed thcmiirlves intu an aflocia- 
tion, whofe objeft was to purchafe meal, to be diftributed 
weekly to the fublcribers only. Each fub'criber, at his entry, 
originally paid five fiiillings, (now feven fliillini^s and fix- 
pence), and thirteen pence a year. It is governed by a dea- 
con, as he is called, and twelve afl'cfi"ors, chofen annually. 
This inftitution has produced very good eH'eiSls The lublcri- 
bers, and the poor in general, are regularly fupplieu at a price 
rather below the rate of the country. Their ftock is now a- 
bout L. 140 Sterling.

which Stranraer labours under The chief fuel is peat and turf, 
brought from the diftance of 3 or 4 miles ; often of a bad 
quality, anJ always high priced. M^ny of the inhabitants 
burn coals in their rooms. Thefe are brought from Air or 
Irvine by fea. and coft the purchafer about fourteen pence 
thf herrmg- barrel, including the price of leading from the 
fhore. A family, keeping only a regular lire in the kitchen, 
and ai'.other jn a parlour, muft expend fix or feven guineas a 
year for firing alone. Would parliament take off the duty 
upon coals carried coaflnife, the improvement of this tovyn, 
and the neighbouring country, would advance with incon- 
ceivaf^le rapidity The late Earl of Stair made feveral unfuc- 
cefsfui attempts to find coal in the neighbourhood. 

Chttrch and Stipetid. — A new, commodious, and even ele- 
gant church, was finifhed in 1785, at a very confiderablc 
expence. ' he ftipend is, at an average, about L. 60 Ster- 
ling, payable in meal and money, as modified in the year 
1*^49, and confirmed by a new decreet in the year 1696. 
One of the preceding incumbents, Mr Walter Laurie, left 
fome parks in the neighbourhood, and a houfe in the town, 
to his fucceflbrs for ever, to fupply the want of a glebe and 
manle 1 he parks are about 30 acres; they hold of Mr 
Vans Agnew, and pay L. 3 : 1 1 : 14., as feu and teind. The 
houfe was rebuilt in 1761. To Mr Laurie's munificence the 
iniiiDier of -^tranraer is indebted for the tolerably decent man- 
ner in which he lives. The minill^er has a right aifo to the 
V ' arnge teind of the herrings taken in Lochryan, by the in- 
habitaiits of the town and Chyhole, at the rate of the twea- 
ticth herring: But this depending on a fubjecl fo preca-

At the eaftern extremity of the town's ;jurirdirHon is a fe- 
ceding meeting-houfe, belonging to the Antiburghers, lirat- 
tered over the whole Rhyns. There are 443 perfons on the 
examination roll of this congregation. There are two otiier 
fedtaries, Smeatonites and M'Millanites, but they are not nu- 
merous. 

School. — The magiftrates built a very convenient fchool- 
houfe a few years ago. The fchoolmaiter's lalary is L. ii. 
The number of fcholars 60 or 70. With quarter wages, and 
the different perquifites commo ly annexed to the office, it 
may be worth between L. 40 and L 50 a year. There are 
fome private fchools alfo ; fome of them pretty numerous in 
fcholars. 

Poor. — The town is opprefled with Irifh vagrants, who 
come over in crowds, and lodge in the fuburbs and neighoour- 
ing cottages; and, belides occafional depredations on proper- 
ty, levy very heavy contributions from the humanity of the in- 
habitants. The poor are fupplied from the weekly collections ; 
from the intereit of a capital of L. 200, accumulated from 
different legacies ; and from an annual benefadtion of the £arl 
of Stair. 

Popiilattcn — The return made to Dr Webfter of the po- 
pulation of this town, about 40 years ago, was only 649 fouls ; 
but now, according to a very accurate enumeration cf the in- 
habitants recently made, there were, at the beginning of the

Rent. — The rent of houfes is in proportion to their Ctua- 
tion and conveniencies. 1 he land contiguous to the town, 
on the eafl: and fouth, is in the parifli of Inch, and belongs 
to the Earl of Stair; that on the fouth-wefi: and weft to Mr 
Vans Agnew, and is in the parifli of Lochfwalt. It is dU 
vided into fmall inclofures with turf fences, to accommodate 
the inhabitants, and is let at various rates, from 20 s. to 2 
guineas an acre.

about IS. 6 d. or 1 9. 10 d. a ftone. The Icareity occalion- 
ed by the bad and late harveO- of 1782 was lefs Itverelv idt 
in Stranraer than in moft places. The late Earl ot Stair, and 
fome of the more wealthy inhabitants, procured tneal early

through the town. This road was made, and is kept in re- 
pair, by government. Government has alfo given a fum of 
money to finifli Ibme crofs roads, which, when iiniihed, will 
render this county as ealy of accefs, both from England and

Name, Situation^ a/id Extent. 

KING'S KETTLE, formerly called Catulj or Katul, is 
fituated in the county of Fife ; in tiie prefbytery of 
Cupar, and fynod of Fife. The origin of the name is uncer- 
tain. It is, however, proved by authentic records, that the 
lands of Kettle were once the property of the crown, and 
were afterwards fued in 8 divifions, in perpetual tacks, at the 
rents then received ; which are ftill paid to the King, under 
the name of Crown Rents. Kettle is bounded by Falkland 
on the Weft 5 by Markinch, Kennoway, and Scoonle, on the 
fouth ; by Ceres, Cult, and Colleffie, on the eaft j and by 
Aughtermuchty on the north. The parifh contains fome- 
.what more than 9 fquare miles. It is of a curved oblong 
figure, narroweft towards the weft ; in length, from eaft to 
weft, nearly 8 miles ; and in its greateft breadth a little more 
than 2 miles. The village of Kettle is fituated in the flat of 
the ftrath, rather low and wet, on the fouth fide of the Eden ; 
the floods of which reach to the flcirts of the village. Bal- 
malcolm is fituated about a furlong fouth-eaft, at the foot of 
the rifing ground ; and the road by Cupar, between the Forth 
Vol. I. 3 A and 



2fo Statijlical Account 

and Tay, runs through it. Coalton is on the brae head abovtr 
it, and is clayey. 

Soily and Surface. — The largefl- and moft valuable part of 
the parifh lies in the courfe of that ftrath which extends 
from Kinrofs to St Andrews. Hers the furface is level ; but 
towards the fouth, fouth-eaft, and fouth-weft of the village, 
which is nearly in the center of the parifh*, it becomes bleak 
and hilly, including the higher grounds which run eaftward 
from the Lomonds. The hills are in general covered with 
verdure, and in fummer afford excellent pafture for all forts 
of cattle ; yet, in fome places, there arc many large rugged 
ftones projefting confiderably above the fnrface. Woods 
are only wanting in this part of the parifh to realife the poet*' 
defcription : 

Juffit et extendi campos, fubfldere valles 
Fronde tegi fylvas, lapidofos furgere montes. 

The nature of the foil is various. In many places on the 
banks of the Eden, which nearly bounds the parifh towards 
the north, there are excellent carfe foils ; yet, at a fmall di- 
ftance from them, extenfive beds of fand, with a moorifh, or 
mofTy furface, are frequently found. The ftratum of fand is 
in many places covered with a flrong ftifF clay, in others 
with a light friable mould. Even in the hilly part of th» 
country, the foil is in general excellent, and of a dark co- 
lour. 

Cnmate and D'lfeafes.^-Hhc climate is, for the moll: part, 
dry and healthy. It is not fubjeft to any local difeafes. Some 
years ago, the ague was frequent in the lower parts of the 
parifh; but, for the lafl 20 years, it has almoil entirely difl 

appeared v

appeared ; owing, moft probably, to the many drains that 
have been made in this and the neighbouring parifhes. The 
common people are now peculiarly liable to dropfical fwell- 
ings of the limbs. During the above mentioned period po- 
tatoes have been introduced, and now form the principal part 
of the fuftenance of the poorer houfeholders. It may per- 
haps be fufpedled, that this change of diet has produced fomc 
alteration in the conftitutions of the inhabitants. 

Rivers, SpringSy ts'c. — There are no confiderable lakes or 
rivers in the parifti. The Eden, whofe ftream in fummer is 
fcarcely fufficient for a corn mill, abounds with excellent red 
and white trout, pike, and eels. There are feveral fprings, 
fome of which are fuppofed to be impregnated with mine- 
rals. The courfe of the Eden being down a low ftrath, bor- 
dered on each fide by hills for a confiderable diftance above 
Kettle, and the river having very little fall, frequently over- 
flowed its banks, fo that the crops on its carfe haughs were 
always precarious, a plan was projefled of making a cut fo 
deep as to confine the water ; but it was never executed, 
■owing to the difagreement of the proprietors of the lands 
which lye on the oppofite fides of the river. About lo years 
ago Mr Johnfton purchafed the whole, and formed the pro- 
jefted cut on an enlarged plan. A fpacioub canal was made 
for the water, 12 feet wide at the bottom, and 30 at the top, 
fccured on the fides by raifed banks and hedges, which in- 
clude a fpace of 70 feet in breadth, and ferve to confine the 
water at high floods. This cut has been carried on a confi- 
derable way, but not with equal efi^e£l, as the diredlion of the 
■ftream was obliged to be accommodated to the convenience 
of perfons with whofe property it interferred. Mr Johnflon, 
-fince his refidence at Lathriflc in 1783, has built an elegant 
iwufc on the cftate. He has alfo got feveral of the farms in- 
to 



372 Stati/iical Account 

to his own hand, and has improved them; fubdivided them 
inoftly with ditch and hedge, and belts of planting ; adorned 
them with clumps of trees, and elegant farm houfes of two 
ftories and garrets, co%'ered with blue flate, and rigged with 
lead ; all which give more vivacity and beauty to this part of 
the country than it had before, and will, when the planting 
is grown up, enliven it much more. 

Minerals. — In the farm of Barntark there is a quarry of 
free-rtone. It is covered by a ftratum of earth 4 feet thick. 
When this is removed, we obfcrve upon the furface of the 
rock numerous impreilions of vegetable bodies, apparently 
formed by branches of trees, of various diameters, curioufly 
ramified and interwoven. The ftone is of the fame nature 
with that bclov/, but of a darker colour. A large piece of 
petrified wood, and a petrified horn, were lately found here. 
About a furlong to the eaftward of this quarry, on the decli- 
vity of the hill, fome perfons fearching for minerals difcover» 
ed a large mafs of petrified fliells of various kinds, fome of 
which were completely filled with tranfparent concretions. 
The mafs is fituated at the lower extremity of a lime-ftone 
rock. The forms of the (hells are moft diftinct on the fur- 
face. There are not any petrifying fprings in the parifh ; 
but, in fome places, ftalaftltes are formed by the oozings of 
coal water. There is no marble or flate here ; but an almoft 
inexhauftibic abundance of moor-ftone and free-ftorie, which 
are of an excellent quality, and much employed in dyking and 
building. Lime-llone of the beft kind is alfo abundant: One 
quarry at Forthar, belonging to Dr Pitcairn, phyfician in Lon- 
don, and farmed by James BIythe, Efq; employs, on an ave- 
rage, 60 perfons throughout the year, in the different procef- 
fes of digging, wheeling away the earth, blowing, and break- 
ing the ftones, and filling the kilns. A great number of men

and horfes are alfo engaged in conveying the lime to New- 
burgh port, for the Carfe of Gowrie, and other parts of 
Perthftiire, &amp;c. The coals with which it is burnt are brought 
from Balbirnie and Balgonie, about 3 miles diftant. A large 
quantity of iron-ftone, excellent in quality, is found on fevc- 
ral parts of thefe eftates. 

In Barntark Muir, the furface of which is a common, and 
covered with heath, coals have long been procured. For 
want of proper cpntrivances to carry off the water, they have 
not as yet been wrought far below the furface. Thefe mines, 
which are the property of Alexander Murray, Efq; of Ayton, 
have been let, for the laft 40 years, to Alexander Low, Efq; 
who is now ferioufly engaged in attempting to obviate thofe 
inconveniencies which have hitherto impeded the working. 
The coals are of a fuperior quality, mofi: of them refembling 
the oily Newcaftle coal. There is another ftratum of coal, 
but inferior in quality, at Dovan, belonging to Dr Pitcairn. 
Cpals have alfo been procured at Clothie, en eftate belong- 
ing to Mr Balfour. Some time fince, when finking a fliaft 
to difcover the extent of the coals, fome metallic ores were 
difcovered, which have not as yet been elTayed. When 
thrown into the fire, they emit a fulphureous fmell, and in 
appearance refemble pyrites. The price of coals at Balgonie 
and Balbirnie Hill is 7 d. per 18 ftone Dutch weight.

Price of Provifioas and Labour. — From the vicinity to Edin- 
burgh, and many coaft towns, provifions are commonly kept 
at the Edinburgh prices. The grain is always lower than 
the loweft Edinburgh or Lothian grain. A day-labourer is 
paid 10 d. a day, on an average; a carpenter or mafon 
IS. 6 d. ; a taylor i s. ; but the common way of charging is 
by the piece. Labourers generally earn about 13 guineas a 
year \ and their wives, if induftrious, about L. 7 or L. 8 by 
fpinning, when not otherwife engaged. The women always 
ipin with both hands. Domeftic men-fervants wages, at an

The mean population may be nearly had by multiplying 
the average of births by 3iy; or the average of deaths by 
54 ; or the average of marriages by 64^ ; or the average of a 
family by the number of families. The mean or average po- 
pulation, for any time, is the real population increafed or di- 
minifhed by half the decreafe or increafe in that time : Thus, 
the real population 1759, diminilhed by 58, half the increafe 
is 1 70 1. But this can only be true on the fuppofition that 
the increafe or decreafe is uniform. The true mean popula- 
tion muft be deduced from the following Table, which pof- 
fcfles many more important ufes than merely determining the 
population.

Manu/aciure. — A confiderablc quantity of linen, from 7 d 
to 2 s. 6 u. a yard is made in the parifh ; a fmall part of it i 
bleached ; but the moft of it is fold as it eomes out of thi 
loom in Cupar or Auchtermuchty, and thence fent to Glaf 

gow 



,of Kettle, 



govv, Leeds, and London. There are about 170 looms, 
which are wrought or fuperintended by about 60 n er- 
weavers ; the number of apprentices is 18, and the xeft of me 
workmen are journeymen. During their apprenticeftiip, or 
ftay in their mafter's hpufes as journeymen, they pay 2 s. a 
week for board, and live wonderfully well. The average 
groC; produce of a loom, including apprentices and old men 
who do little work, is about L. 60 a year, (a good hand will 
fetch confiderably above L. looj ; and the average grcrs,.ex- 
pence to the mafter in lint, fplnning, boiling, working, &amp;c. is 
about L. 46 : 15 : o, moft of which is laid out in the parifh 
and near neighbourhood. The looms find employment for 
women and children ; and hence, a family being advanta- 
geous, the men marry early ; and hence one of the principal 
caufes of the increafed population. This manufafture .circu- 
lates above L. 10,000 annually ; the greatefi: part of which is 
brought into the parifli, as all the work is performed by the in- 
habitants ; and the ^greatefl: part of .the raw-material is home 
produce. Of the flax ufed, about 4^ is Dutch, and \ Riga.j 
the reft is the produce of Kettle. 

Agi'iculture^ Produce^ ^c. — The farms in the parifli are 1,2, 
and the average of fervants on each is 5, viz. 3 men and z 
women. Moft of the farms have ccca^es. whence they 
.obtain affiftance in hay-time and harveit. I-eGdes thefe, 
there are man/ pendicles {pr^dkla), partly let ofi" the farms, 
and partly let immediately by the proprietor ; and a gre^t 
number of fmall fcuS, from i to 5 acres. The farms are very 
unequal, both in fize and rent. The rent of pafture grounds 
is .from 4 s. to L. i : 5 : o, and of arable land from 5 s. to 
L. I : 1 1 : 6 an acre. About a fourth part of the arable

Antiquhtes, — On Banden Hill, which overlooks Coal- 
ton from the eaftward, and commands an extenfive view of 
the Strath of Eden, from KinrofG to St Andrews Bay, are 
fome remains of a circumvaliation and rampart, of which 
tradition is fiient. It is of a circular form, and nearly 2co 
yards in diameter. About half a mile to the eaftward 
is another eminence, with ruins of the fame kind on its 
fummit. It is called Down Hill j is the higheft in the pa- 
rifli ; and commands the whole Strath of Leven, the Firth, 
and the Lothians. From the fituation of thefe buildings, they 
were probably ufed as places of obfervation. The Knock of 
Clathe is a beautiful hill, rifing fmoothly without any appear- 
ance of fortificatiops. A regular coffin, of fix ftones, was 
found here fome time ago, by men who were digging for 
gravel. Within it were human bones, and ftveral trinketsj 
among which was the braf? head of a fpear, now in the pof- 
fcffion of the Earl of Leven. There are at leaft 8 barrows 
in the parifh, 3 of which have names : Pandlcr's Know, and 
Lowrie's Know, in Forthar ground } and Liquorich Stone in 
Kettle ground. Bones have been found in the reft. There 
15 a tradition about the firft, that, when diflcnfions arofe be- 
tween families in different parts of the country, they met 
there to decide their contention by arm?, and thofe who fell 
were buried in the tumulus. The barrow in Forthar is faid 
to have been a regular place of burial, and to have had a 
church or chapel near it. But of this no veftiges are now 
extant.

parlfh of Kettle, and through which lay the old road from 
Cupar to Kinghorn, belonged to a family of Setons, who are 
celebrated in tradition for the nioft cruel robberies and mur- 
ders. The grounds about Clatto Den are ftill defert. In the 
face of the brae, which forms one fide of the den, is a cave, 
that is faid to communicate with the old caftle or tower of 
Clatto, a furlong diftant, the remains of which are ftill vi- 
fible. The fame cave is laid to have had another opening ,to 
the road, at which the affailant rufhed out on the heedlefs 
paiBengers, and dragged them into the cavern, whence there 
was no return. All appcirance of a cave is now obliterated, 
by the breaking down of the banks. A fimilar cavern was 
found, not many years ago, at Craighall in Ceres parifli. Of 
thefe Seatons many ftoriec, replete with the fuperftitions of 
preceding ages, are ftill current among the country people. 
One may fuffice. One of the Scottifh Kings, faid to be 
James IV. paiUng that way alone, as was common in thofe 
days, was attacked by a fon of Seaton's. The King having a 
hanger concealed under his garment, drew it, and with a 
blow cut off the right hand that feized his horfe's bridle. 
This hand Jie took up, and_ rode off. Next day, attended 
by a proper retinue, he vifited the Caftk of Clatto, wifhing 
to fee Seaton and his fons, who were noted as hardy enter- 
prifing men, fitted to fliine 4n a more public ftation. The 
old man conducted his family into the King's prefence^ One 
fon alon,e was abfent: It was faid, that he had been hurt by 
an accident, and was confined in bed. The King iiififted oa 
/e.ejng him, and defired to feel his pulle. The .young man 
Jield out his left hand. The King would feel the other alfo. 
^fter many ineffectual cxcufes, he was obliged to confefs that 
he had loft his right hand. The King told him that he had 
a hand in his pocket, which was at his fervice if it would fit 
liifn. Upoo this they jvere all feized and executed.

of Kettle, 3^85 

Mtfeellatmus Obfervatlons . — The people are in general cha» 
ritable, and well difpofed. Both living and drefs have un- 
dergone a remarkable change within thefe 20 years, owing 
to the influx of wealth, and rife of wages. Few, however, 
have proved infolvent. Property has, in confequence, in- 
creafed in value, and is now rated at 29 years purchafe. A 
martial fpirit feems to pervade t-h« lower ranks, who caa 
fcarcely be prevented from entering into the army or navy on 
the report of a war. Their condition might perhaps be me- 
liorated by improving the lands ftill farther, and encouraging 
the loom ; but, on tlie whole, few diftri^ls in the country 
have more reafon to be fatisfied with their prefent ftate. 

Kettle poflefles very material advantages in, its coal and 
lime works. Marl is eafily procured. The lands are impro- 
ved and drained with facility, from their floping direction, 
and plenty of water. It affords employment and fubfiftence 
for the whole of its inhabitants. The language commonly 
fpoken is Englilh, with a provincial accent, Th« names of 
places are faid to be derived from the Gaelic. 

No eflentlal hurt was felt from the fevere years 1782 nor 
1783 in this parifh. Some individuals, perhaps, might be a 
little diftreffed ; but, in general, the farmers made money in 
thofe years. The crops being early, and tolerably reaped, 
yielded much meal, and fiipplied feveral places with good 
feed. Whatever degree of improvemeiit this parifh has yet 
attained, has almofi: all been given it (excepting the eftate of 
Welter Lathrifk) within thefe 12 years. Much, however, 
yet remains to be done, both in acquiring fyftem and ex€cu» 
lion. 

There are 7 or 8 public houfes in the parifli, but they

produce no bad effcfts ; Moft of them are plaices of accom- 
modation, and could not be wanted. The inhabitants of this 
parifh are neither chargeable with the vice of drunkennefsj 
nor of wafting their time or money. Several new houfcs 
have lately been built. Few cottages have been built, and 
few allowed to become ruinous. There is no jail in the 
parifh. Feudal fervices arc wholly obliterated.

DELTING, or, perhaps, v^ich more propriety, Deltaing *, 
is of Danifh or Norwegian origin. The parilh is in 
the county of Orkney and Shetland, and preftjytery of Shet- 
land, which has fynodical powers within itfelf, the General 
Aflembly being the immediate court of appeal. It is bounded 
on the weft by the parifti of J«Iorthmaving, from which it is 
divided by a long hafrow voe, called Sulom Voc ; on the eaft 
by Netting and Lunnafting ; on the north by Yell Sound, 
which feparates it from Yell ; and on the fouth by the pa- 
irifhes of Wiefdale and Sandfting. It is difficult to ftate with 
iny degree of preciiioti the length or brea Jth of this parifh, 
as it is much interfefbed by narrow voes, and no part of it is 
above two iTiilf; from fo ne fea. J he appcaraiice of the coun- 
try is hilly, bleak, and barreii* The hills afford plenty of ex-

but a very fmall proportion to the waile and uncultivated part^ 
produces, in good feafons, very tolerable crops of barley, and 
a kind of bleak oats, and abundance of potatoes. Cabbage 
thrive in every kail yard ; but turnip, cartrot, parfnip, &amp;c. are 
only to be found in gentlemens gardens. 

Climate and Dtfeafes. — The air is moift, but not unhealthy. 
The old people fay that dtfeafes are now more comn^on than 
formerly, whicfh rnay be'afcrib'ed to the chan^ in the mode

v/ill ftint themlelves in many effential necefiaries of life, in- 
order to procure tljis article of luxury. -The moft common 
difiempers are the Icurvy, which is not to be wondered at, as 
the people live much on fi{ii and flefh, and ufe very little ve- 
i^etable food.. - The dampnefs of the climate may likewife 
contribute to bring this terrible diforder to the height in 
which it ofcqn appears. . Rheumatic and hervous complaints 
are faid to be more common Jiovv tha.n they were fome year's

made during the fit. One obfervation occurs on this difor^

and during the two laft years of plenty it has appeared more- 
tequently. 

- Lakes, Coq/Is, I/Iands, Fijljerles^ — There are in the parifh force 
Cnall lakss or lochs, and fome fmall rivulets, but no ftreani 
that deferves the name of a river. In thefe lakes and rivu ! 
lets, the only fifh is a fmall kind of trout ; but, about the be- 
ginning of Auguft, fea trouts, of a very large fize, are caught 
in nets made for the purpofe in the mouth of the different; 
rivulets. No fifh of this kind are ever fold, but given in pre- 
fents through the neighbourhood. The inhabitants fit out 
boats for the ling, cod, and tufk fifhing, on the coafts of the 
neighbouring parifh of Northmaving. The feafon of this 
fifliery is during the months of June and July, and a part of 
Auguft. How far the people, iii general, are benefited by 
this fifliing, will appear from the following flatement.

It may be proper to add, that, on the eaft fide of the counj. 
try, each boat docs not carry above 45 or 50 ground lines. 
The fifhery on that fide is carried on at much lefs expence ^ 
but is, in general, proportionally fmaller than on the weft fide. 
This year the filhery has been very unfuccefsful j fo that the 
boats will not have 400 ling, inftead of the 800, which is 
ftated as an average. The confequence muft be, that the poor 
fifhermen, difappointed in this only fource of gain, muft this: 
year fall greatly in arrears to their landlords. 

Thefe fifli are cured for exportation to Spain, Hamburgl^, 
and Ireland. They fell, when dried, from ids. to i is. a cwt. 
This year, in general, no higher price than 1 1 s. has beeji 
given, bcfides the 3 s. allowed by government for every cwt, 
exported. The grcateft part of the cod and tufk is fcnt to» 
Leith, and fold at between 16 s. and 19 s. a cwt. The pro- 
prietors of the lands, or receivers of the filh, make, on an 
average, a profit of L. 10 Sterling from every fiftiing boat 
belonging to their eftates. Every tenant is obliged to fit out 
a certain fliare of a boat, in proportion to the extent and va- 
lue of the land he poflefies.

p.oft years, plenty of iaiall fiflb, from the livers of which a

confiderable quantity cf oil is made. This fifliing is the moft 
beneficial to the poor tenants, as it is attended with no ex- 
pence, and brings not only wholefome food to their families, 
but oil, which generally fells at 30s. or 35 and fometimes 
at 50 s. a barrel. 

The common Tea weed, here called iang, is pretty general- 
ly, and fuccefsfuliy, ufed as a manure for the lauds. It is 
but very lately that the attention of the gentlemen of this 
country has in any meafure been turned to the making of 
kelp. This article has, however, been increafing for fome 
years paft ; fo that it is now believed there may be from 200 
to 300 tons annually exported from the whole country. 

There are feveral creeks and harbours in the parifh, which 
would be of high importance in many parts of the kingdom, 
but are here of very little confequence. There is an inlet of 
the Tea from St Magnus Bay, through a place called the Minn, 
a found which divides the Ifland of Vehementry, in Sandfting 
parifh, from Mickle Rhoe in this parifh. This inlet or voe 
furnlflies feveral excellent harbours •, luch as Bufta Voe, South 
Voeter, and Alnafirth, In all of thefe there is fafe anchorage 
for veffels of a confiderable burden ; as alfo at Elwick and 
Mavinfgrind, both at the head of Sulom Voe, which divides 
this parifli from Northmaving. If a canal was cut from the 
head of Sulom Voe to Bufta Voe, which could be done at a 
very moderate expence, it would open an eafy communication 
between all the moft confiderable fifhing ftations in the coun- 
try, and afford"^ a fafe navigation to fhips of any fize through 
the middle of the country. If ever fuch a canal fliould be 
cut, the banks of it would be a moft convenient fituation 
for a manufacturing village, which is not more wanted in any 
prt of his Majefty's dominions than here: For, during one 

half 



of Delting. - 371 

^kU of the year at leaft, a great part of the people are idle; 
'and during the other half, what little work they perform can 
niake no adequate return for their labour. Nay, after a4l 
their toil, they often do not receive the original value of the 
raw materials employed in their homely manufacture of fingic 
ftockings j which, however,- is the only way by which many 
of the inhabitants can earn a fingle penny. It would be pre- 
ferable for them to fell thie Wool, rather than take ap thesr 
time in'mariufadliiring it in fo~ unprofitable a manner.

part of it, ave, 'Mickle Rhoe, 24 miles in circumference, con- 
taining 14 famtliesj who live on 'a few fpots which have been 
brought under ciiltrvation within thefe 40 or 50 years : Thefe 
lye alohg the fta coafV: The other parts of the ifland are co- 
vered w'ith a k\tid of heath, which aiTords no bad pafturage 
for ftieep, horned cattle, and horfes ; of all which a gre^t 
number might be reared with a fmall degree of attention. 
This ifland lies on the foxith conft of the parifh. On the 
north end are tlve iflands of Little R hoe, containing 2 famr- 
lies; Brother Ifle, 2 families; Fifhholm, 1 family.. Thefe 3 
iflands are in Yell Sound, on the northern extremity of the 
"parifli. None of themVould be inhabited but for the fake 
of the fifheries, as the little corn thiy produce is generally 
blafted by the fea. Bigga is another iiland in Yell Soimd, 
containing 4 families y half of it belongs to Dehing, and half 
to Yell. 

Agriculture^ Cattk, — There are. not above fix plouglrs 
in the parifli, and thefe of a very Angular conftrnctlon. They 
are made of a fmall crooked piece of wood, at the end of 
which is fixed a flender pliable piece of oak, that is faftened 
to the yokes laid acrofs the necks of the oxen. The man

who holds the plough walks by its fides and direfts It with i, 
ftilt or handle fixed on the top of it. The driver, if he can 
be fo called, goes before the oxen, and pulls them on by a 
rope tied round their horns j and fome people with fpades 
follow the plough, to level the furrow and break the clods. 
The only crops are black oats, fown in April, and barleys 
fown in May. Both are reaped in the end of Auguft, or du- 
ring the month of Septembcri The v/ant of inclofares has 
prevented any attempts to fow artificial graifles ; but the mea- 
dows furnifli a confideMble quantity of natural hay. The 
parifh can never fupply itfelf with meal. A cbnfiderablc 
number of black cattle and fliecp is annually fold to the Ler- 
wick merchants, who kill them, and fend them packed to 
Leith market ; meal, flourj bifcuits, barley, and other articles, 
being bought in return. The hills, in general, ?u"e covered 
with heath, and affbrd g6o4 pafturage for ftieep, which go 
wild without any herdfman to attend them. They are in 
general, however, fd far tame, that they can be driven into 
punds or fmall inclofures, wiiere the wool is pulled off, the 
young lambs matked, and fuch ram lambs cut as are not in- 
tended for tups to the flock. 

Lime has never been ufed as a manure, except in a very 
few inftances, where it never failed to produce great returns j 
in fome thirty, in fome fixty, and in Ibme an hundred fold. 
But improvements by lime, or any other means, is feldom at- 
tempted here, for this obvious realon, that the tenants have 
no leafes : They confider themfelves as the tenants of a day^ 
and have neither inclination nor fpirit to attempt any effec- 
tual improvement of the grounds they poffefs ; thinking, and 
with juftnefs, that another may reap the benefit of all the 
endeavours they might ufe to meliorate their farms. 

The

The parifh abounds in horfes, horned cattle, and flieep : 
The paftures might no doubt bear a much greater number 
of each than they now contain. There is no faying, with, 
minute exailnefs, what may be the number of each. If 
the flieep are flated at 8000, it will not be materially under 
or above the truth. There may be about 700 milch cows, 
befides oxen and young cattle. What the number of horfes 
may be it is impoffible to fay ; but there is certainly a great 
number : They are very fmall ; and, owing to the little at- 
tention paid to the fele£tion of proper ftallions, they are be- 
coming fmaller every year. 

The winter of 1 784 was very fevere, and cut off a great num- 
ber of fheep and horned cattle in every part of thefe iflands. 
An account was taken, at the defire of the miniflier, in this pa- 
rifh, and the return was 4506 fheep *, and 427 black cattle, 
dead in the courfe of the winter, befides horfes, of which no 
accurate account could be obtained. This, joined to a year 
of as great fcarcity as the country had ever experienced, was 
very hard on the poor tenants ; and they have not yet reco- 
vered the lofs. In that winter, the flieep were often dug out 
of the fnow,. after continuing under it for 20 days ; during 
all which time they had no food, but eat the wool from the 
backs of each other. Some that died after they were taken 
out were opened, and a hard ball of wool was found in their 
flomach. The general poverty of the inhabitants their being 
obliged to be from home during the fifliing feafon ; the fmall^ 
nefs of their farms, and the precarious tenure by which thsy 
hold them ; all confpire to keep them in a ftate of indigence. 

Every 



♦ This was the number of dead flieep that were found ; many 
perifhed wliofe carcafes were n^yer found. 
Voj. I. 3D 



394 Btatijieal Account 

Every man, from the age of 1 8 to 70, muft attend the fifiiing 
from the ift June to the 14th Auguft. None arc left at home 
but z \yife, with perhaps a number of young children, who 
require all her attention. Every thing in the farming line 
muft confequently go to wreck. 

The horned cattle and fheep are fmall, but the beef and 
iHUtton fwtet and well flavoured. The fheep, in general, carry 
very foft fleeces. A few are to be found which carry wool of 
a very fine quality, of which ftockings are made, that fell at 
different prices, from 15 s. to 40 s. a pair, Some are knit fo 
fine as to be eafily drawn through a common ring, and do not 
weigh above 2 ounces. In the year 1782, the beft ox could 
liave been bought for L. 20 Scots; the beft cow from L. i? 
to 15 Scots. This year, 1790, and for a few years, paft, 
L. 36 Scots is thought a moderate price for a good ox ; and 
L. 24 Scots is often paid for a fat cow. The price of 
Iheep feems to have varied very little in the memory of man- 
Ip the neighbourhood of Lerwick, 5 s. are paid for a wedder ; 
but in this parifli, and many other parts of the country, 3 s. 
is thought a high price. The carcafe of an ox weighs 
from 3 to 4 cwt. ; that of a cow from 170 to 2301b. A well 
grazed cow yields from 32 to 42 ib. tallow ; a well grazed 
ox from 48 to 70 lb. fometimes 90 lb. tallow. 

Population. — In 1 752, the number of fouls in the parifli were 
956. In 1785, there were 141 7. In 1 790, there were j 504. 
There are now alive only 5 houfeholders who were living 25 
years ago. One woman is now alive aged loi years; another 
died lately at the age of 105 ; and another died in 1784 at 
the age of 98. She died in the fame houfe in which flie 
was born, and had flept only two nights out of it. The 
number of families is now 223. Each houfeholdcr has a 

fmaU 



395 



fmali farm, wliich in good feafons, and when the fmall fifti- 
ing of fillocks and pullocks does not fail, may fupply his fa- 
mily for three quarters of the year. Including farm fervants, 
there were, in 1782, 364 of all kinds in the parifh. The 
number is much the fame at prefent^ 

The population of the parifli is materially different from 
\vhat it was fome years ago. The alteration proceeds from 
this obvious caufe. The inhabitants have not been long com- 
pelled by their landlords to profecute the ling fifhery ; but, 
fince the proprietors thought proper to employ their tenants 
in that lirie, it has become an objeft to have as many men 
as poffible on their grounds. This circumftance has induced 
4hem to fplit the farms, and make them fo fmall, that there 
are now, in many inftances^ four families on a farm which 
was pofTefied, 20 or 30 years ago, by one. 

There are very few batchelors. The people, in general, 
marry young. A young lad, when he comes to the age of 18 
or 19 years, goes to the fummer fifhery for a fee of L. 16 
to L. 26 Scots. Sometimes the fees are as high as L. 28 
Scots for 10 fummer weeks. When they have been one fea- 
fon at the fifiiing, they generally confider themfelves as 
men. They are encouraged to marriage by their landlords, 
in order to prevent them from leaving the country ; and the 
confequences commonly are, that they find themfelves invol- 
ved in debt and large families in a very few years. There is 
a fet of very old regulations, called Country AEls by one of 
which it is enafted, that no pair ftiall marry unlefs they be 
poflelTed of L. 40 Scots of free ^ear. This regulation, as 
tv-ell as all the reft, is now not enforced ; though all of them 
Appear to have been well calculated for the good police of the 
country. It is faid that thefe regulations were approved and 

confirmed 



^g6 Statl/lical Account 

.confirmed by the parliament of Scotland, in the reign 
Queen Mary, or of James VI. 

There has been no emigration from the parifti during the 
time of the prefent incumbent : But, almoft every year, a 
great number of young lads engage with the Greenland fhips, 
which touch at Briflay Sound on their outward paflage in the 
month of March and April. They receive from 30 s. to 40 s. 
.a month. Many of thefe men are landed on the ifland when 
the fhips return from Greenland ; but many go at laft into 
the navy. It is a fa£t well afcertained, tJiat in the year 1 763, 
there were 900 Shetland men paid off. What number re- 
mained in the fleet after the peace it is impoffible to fay. 

The number of inhabited houfes is 223. In each houfe, 
on an average, there may be from 6 to 7 people. There arc 
at prefent no uninhabited houfes.

Divifion and Rental of Land.- — The arable ground in the 
parifh has never been meafured, fo as to afcertain the num^ 
ber of acres. An acre is a mode of meafurement little known 
in this country. The old and ftanding mode is by merks of 
land, which are of very different fizes in different parts, ac- 
cording to their goodnefs. The lands have been, time im- 
memorialj divided into i2 penny, 9 penny, and 6 penny 

land. 



3'9S Stati/lical Account 

land. In a few inftancos, fome of the 12 penny land ha'5 
been meafured, and was found to be ^ of an acre to each 
fherk, and 6 penny land ^ acre to each merk. The rents of 
the different quality of land is thus ftat^d : 12 penny land 
pays yearly 1 6 merks of butter, and L. 1:4:0 Scots ; 9 pen- 
ny land pays yearly 1 2 merks of butter, and L. i Scots pcf 
stn. ; 6 penny land pays yearly 8 merks of butter and 1 2 d, 
m. ; each merk butter beinrr cammonly converted at 2 1 d. 
it is to be obferved, that what is paid for thefe lands has not 
been raifed, perliaps, lince thefe iflands were annexed to the 
crown of Scotland. Of late, however, the price of the but- 
ter-rent, when not paid in kind, has been raifed from 5 to 7, 
8, and 9 s. a lifpund. Till a few years ago, it was confi- 
dered as a ftanding regulation, that the butter part of the 
land-rent fliould be converted at 5 s. a lifpund ; a lifpund con- 
tains 24 "merks, equal to 32 lb. Engllfli ; but the faftor for 
the fuperior thought proper to charge the current price for 
the feu-duty butter ; and many of the proprietors of the 
tountry followed this example : So that a merk of butter, 
ivhich weighs i^^lib. Englifh, is fometimes 3 d. 4 d. and ^id, 
inftead of being fixed at the old converfion of 25 d. a merk, 
which was the former regulation. This the tenants eonfider 
as a hardftiip, as few of them can pay their butter rents in 
kind. 

What is called the rentalled land of the parilh amounts 
to 854 merks of land, about 600 acres. Befidcs this, 
there are many outfets, or new improvements, which are 
made by the proprietors, in order to find a fettlement 
for the young men who marry, and whom they cannot ac- 
commodate with fettlements on rentalled or improved 
lands. It appears rather doubtful how far thefe outfets or 
new inclofures have been for the real good of the ifland. 

Thefe 



9f Belting, 35j 

Thefc attempts to Improve have generally been undertaken by^ 
young beginners in the world, who had neither ftrength of, 
hands to improve the grounds, nor flocks of cattle to furnifh 
manure. 

The whole rent of the parifti is 547 lifpund 22 merks in 
butter, and L. 1152 : 11 : 4 Scots in money; or, convert- 
ing the butter at L. 3 a lifpund, L. 2796 : 6 : 4 Scots in all, 
or L. 233 •.o:6\ Sterling. 

To the above may be added, 40 d. from each family for 
fcrvices, when not paid in kind, and a hen and cock from e-. 
very 2 merks of land in the parifli. Befides the above land- 
rent payable to the proprietors, the tenants pay feveral othec 
duties, fuch as corn-teind, which varies from 4 merks of butter 
and i can of oil for each merk of lanu, to 2 merks butter and 
I can of oil. They likewife pay the ce.. , and certain payments 
are claimed by Sir T. Dundas, called Scatt, Wattle, and Ox- 
penny. Thefe payments vary. In fome places they are only 
4 d. or 5 d. a merk of land ; in other places they are as high 
as 12 d. and 13 d; payable in butter and oil in moft inftan- 
ces. Thefe payments are generally confidered of Danifh o- 
rigin, as taxes paid to the crown of Deninark, and continued 
fince the annexation of the country to the crown of Scot- 
land. When the lands are let in leafe, or, as it is here call- 
ed, tack, the tackfman commonly pays rent, and half-rent ; 
and in many inftances, double the ufual rents, for the pro- 
fits of fifliing. 

The parifli is fo extenfive, that it is impoffible to fay 
what proportion of the land is wafte. No proper divifion of 
the wafte lands or commons has yet taken place, nor per- 
haps ever will. For this reafon, the iheep and cattle of dif-

ferent proprietors muft occafionally incroach on each o- 
ther's property no herds attend to prevent thefe incroach- 
ments, and they muft bear with one another. The marches 
of the paftures of the different towns or farms are very im- 
perfeftly afcertained. 

Church. — ^The Hving is now let for L. 56 Sterling, exclu- 
five of an augmentation of L. 11 13:4 lately obtained. The 
prefent incumbent is Mr John Morifon, who was fettled in 
April 1782. Sir Thomas Dundas is patron. The manfe 
was repaired after the adoiiffion of the prefent incumbent. 
There are two churches ; the principal one about 7 and the 
other 3 miles from the manfe ; both in extremely bad order. 
There arc 26 heritors, all refident except one ; but the great- 
eft part of them have only very fmall properties. 

Prices of Provifions and Labour. — Beef commonly fells at 
1 ^ d. a pound ; flaughtered veal is feldom fold ; a living calf 
is fold for is. 6 d. or i s. 8 d. the Ikin of which will fell a- 
gain for 8 d. or i s. 3 d. Mutton is never fold by the 
weight ; an ordinary fheep may fell for 3 s. or 5 s.; a lamb 
for IS. 2d. to I s. 6 d. J pigs newly farried 6 d. or 8 d. ; a 
good goofe may weigh 10 lib. and is fold for 8 d. ; chic- 
kens 2 d. a piece ; a hen 4 d. ; a cock 2 d. ; Butter has been 
formerly ftated. Cheefe is never made. The price of barley 
and oats varies according to their plenty or fcarcity. Wheat 
is not known in the parifh. 

In this country, every labourer, and workman of all kinds, 
mull be maintained in the family where they work. A com- 
mon day-labourer's wages is 6 d. j mafons, 10 d. to 1 s. 2 d. 
The only fuel is peat. This article is not to be bought. E- 
v?ry houfeholder employs fuch a number of his friends and 
• neighbours

neighbours as he thinks neceflary, to dig the proper quanti- 
ty, rhele are entertained with meat in abundance, fpirits, 
and tobacco. 1 he expence, on thefe occafions, may be about 
I s. 8 d for every man employed. Women-fervants, for the 
care of the children, and other work within doors, have L. i 
Sterhng, a ftilrt at 3 s. and a pair ot flioes at 2 or 3 s. for 
their yearly wages. Farm women lervants L. 6 Scots each, 
and a pair of (hoes. A man-fervant, for three quarters of 
the year, has L. 9 Scots, and a pair of fhoes. No man lervant 
can be got during the fifhing fealon, as they have better wa- 
ges at the fifliing. 

Antiquities. — There are three PiiTlilh caftles in this parifli, 
one at Burravock, one at Brough, and another at Burranefs. 
Thefe are all cf a circular form, and have no entrance but 
from the top. They are built of ftones of fuch a fize as 
could not have been raifed without the ule of engines which 
could hardly have been fuppofed to be in ufe at the rude pe- 
riod in which thefe buildings muft have been erecled. There 
are, in different parts of the country, Pidifli caftles, more 
entire than thofe in this parifh. No tradition, or hiftorical 
account, can now be had ; owing, perhaps, in a great mea- 
fure, to this circumftance, that very few of the defcendants 
from the original inhabitants now remain. When thefe 
iflands were transferred from Denmark to Scotland, many 
from Scotland came over in different lines. By dint of fu-» 
perior wealth, fuperior wifdom, or (bme other means, ma- 
ny of them ac([uired eftates, by buying out the Norvegian 
proprietors, whofe poffeffions in general were fraall, ov/ing to 
a regulation they had, of dividing their lands equally among, 
their children. This regulation had rendered the poffeflions 
of each individual very trifling in many inftanccs.

Mifccllaneous Ohfervations. — The people in general are not 
difpofed to induitry ; for which they cannot, however, be 
much blamed, as no way has yet been pointed out to them 
by which they might turn their mduftry to account. No 
manufactures are eitablifhed ; and, excepting what the men 
may gain by fifliing, the wives and children at kelp burning 
during a few weeks in lummer ; they have not a probable 
chance of earning a penny, but by the manufacture of iingle 
ftockings, which is lols of time, to call it no worfe. 

Mofl of the young men who leave the country embrace a 
feafaring life. It is the only line with which they have a 
chance of being acquainted. Many, whcrhave left the coun- 
try in this line, in a very mean way, have rifen to indepen- 
dent and genteel ftations. On the preicnt alarm of war, one 
hundred men were demanded by the Admiralty belore they 
would grant proteftion to the trade and filheries of thefe 
iilands. The proportion of this parifh was fix men. Sixteen, 
however, entered voluntarily. 

The people are rather expenfive and luxurious for their 
clrcumftances. This may be alcribed to many cauies j one in 
particular is, that their iandmaflers give them unlimited credit. 
The people think they are entitled to this, becaufe they fifh 
for them. Whatever they want, or think they want, is fur- 
nifhed from the booth or ftofehoiife of the proprietors, ov 
bought from the fhops in Lerwick. When the day of ac- 
count comes, it very often happens that the gainings of the 
year cannot nearly pay for the espence. 

The people in general are hofpifable in the extreme, and dif- 
pofed to humane and generous aftions. Few wrecks have ever 
happened on the coufts of this p«rifii, but, when they have 

happened.

Iwppened, every attention has been fliewn to fave and com- 
fort the diftrcfled. When the watch was not very ftrifl, at- 
tempts indeed might be made to pilfer from the wreck. 

The circumftances of the inhabitants cannot be materially 
bettered, nor their fuiiation rendered more comfortable, un- 
til one radical evil is removed, viz. the Ihort and precarious 
nature of the leales. For no man can have a Ipirit for im- 
provement, or pay any great attention to rear a ftock on a 
poirellion from which he knows not but he may be turned off 
next year. Another thing effentially neceffary would be to 
eren: fiflnng and manufafturmg villages, and the introduc- 
tion of proper manufadtures among them, fo that the induf- 
trious part of them might have conftant employment, which, 
is now far from being the cafe. The manufadures mpft pro- 
per for this country are, ift, woolen manufa£iures, in which 
the inhabitauts are fo far back, that they often fell their wool 
to the Orkney people at a very low price, and next year buy 
their fluffs, made of the fame wool, at a very high price. A 
well condufled rnanufadlure of fifhing lines would fave a great 
deal of money to the country, and fecure to the inhabitants 
a more certain fupply of this important article than they can 
have while they depend entirely on an importiUion from 
Hamburgh. A tannery might he of comiderable advantage. 
At preient, raw hydes are exported, except a" few which are 
tsnned iii the country, but lo indifferently, as to produce lea- 
of no durability. 

A total fuppreflion of fmuggling would contribute greatly 
to the profperity, and preiervation of the morals, of the peo- 
ple j provided, at the fame time, the excil'e was taken off 
fuch fpirits as are conlumed by the fifliermen during the fifh-

ing feafon. They cannot prolecutc the fifliing without a 
little, and they cannot afford to ufe duty paid ipirits. 

A material alteration would be neceflary in conducting the 
few improvements which are attempted. Inftead of fettling 
the youngeft and poorelt beginners on the new outfets, they 
ought to be given to men of ftock and wealth fufficient to 
enable them to make a proper improvement of the foil. The 
leafes ought to be long, and, for a few years at leafi, the rents 
very moderate. 

Until tlie agriculture of the country be brought to more 
pcrfcdlion than it is at prefent, until manufaftures fhall be e- 
fbablifhed, and villages eretSled, it would be proper to difcou- 
rage, as much as poffible, early marriages, when the parties 
have nothing to begin the world with, and perhaps both 
parties confiderably in debt before marriage. The tenants 
complain that they are obliged to fell all their fifli, oil, 
&amp;c to their landlords. It is, however, doubtful how far any 
alteration of this fyftem would be beneficial to them, were 
they allowed to fell their fifli, oil, &amp;c. to the higheft bidder. 
Their land-renrs would of courfe be raifed, and they might 
be dtprived of that afliflance, which they will always need ia 
years of Icarcity, until proper manufadlures are eftabliflied a- 
jnong them. 

Some years ago, a linen manufadure was eftabliflied, and a 
bleach fiei .i 1 id out, but was foon given up, after the company 
conc erned had expended abopt L. 1600 Sterling on the hou- 
fc works, and machinery. The principal heritors in the 
country had fliares in this enterprife •, but, whether it was 
ovv .ig to the improper management of thofe employed to 
condudl: it, or from the company beginning on too extenfive

a plan, the fcheme failed, and the partners lofl: every penny 
of their relpeftive (hares. A linen manufaiture was (urdy 
improper as a firfi: attempt to introduce manufactures into 
this country, tar back in improvement, becaufe no flax is rai- 
fed in the ifland, and the people had never been previoufly 
inrtrufted in the mode of Ijpinning lint. The fame fum ex- 
pended in eftablifhing a woolen manufafture would have done 
efTential good to the inhabitants, and would have employed 
many a hand which is now idle, or employed in deftroying 
materials, which ought to be turned to a more profitable ac- 
count. 

Another way by which the fltuation of the people in this 
country would be confiderably bettered, would be to ufe lefs 
of Engllfh cloths, and tineries of different kinds, which have 
of late been imported in amazing quantities, and to be fatisfied, 
as their forefathers were, with cloth and ftufi^s made from the 
fleeces of their own flocks, and manufactured by their own 
hands. But, at prefent, few or none will appear from home 
in any manufacture of the ifland, even on ordinary occafions. 
All are clad in Engiifii cloths or ftuffs, a very few of the moft 
frugal excepted. 

There are no bridges, nor fo much as the form of a road, 
through the ifland. The traveller goes on his way with cau- 
tion, through the hills and deep mofies ; and, by turning 
fometimes to the one hand, and fometimes to the other, en- 
deavours, in the beft manner he can, to get clear of the mires 
and ditches, and peat-banks, that fall in his way. No fuch 
thing as ftatute-labour is exaCted, which appears a great de- 
fe£t in the police ; for, thou h regular roads could not perhaps 
be made j yet, by very little attention every year, a much more

different parts of the country. 

The fituation of this, and indeed of every parifli in thefe 
iflands,in the years 1782 and 1 783, and for lour years after that 
period, was deplorabie indeed. Tlie crop of 1782 failea j the 
-eropof I7?{3 was ItiU worle } and,, to, complete the calaaiity, a 
general mortahty of the horned cattle and (heep took place 
during the wirvter, as before nicntioncd. Few, in comparilpiij 
were left ahve ; and the djftr lieel pofl'effors of their poor re- 
mains were obliged to lell the greater part, m order to purchafe 
meal for their families. The meal was from L. 2 : 5 : o to 
L. 2 : 7 : o a. boll, i he molt lubftantial farmers, after the 
lofs of their cattle and -eep, could not afford to purchale a- 
ny adequate fupply i and many of the poorer could purchafe 
little or none, but lived ii.oftly on Wilks, limpets, and luch.o- 
ther Ihell-hfh, as the lea-fliores afforded, added to the charity 
of their richer neighbours, which, in luch circumitances, 
could not reach far, as there were many to leek, and very 
few that could afford 10 give a morfel. This parilh had a 
deep fliare in the general diftrels., being the pooreQ: parifli in 
the country. Government gave fome lupply ; and news of 
iheir diftrefs cahed forth liberal fubfcriptions for their relief, 
both in Lnglnnd and Scotland. With thefe provifions were 
bought, and fent to the country, and diflribgted in propor- 
tion to the diftrels ot individuals. This, joined to a general 
good fmall fifhcry which providentially prevailed during moft 
of the Itarce years above mentioned, greatly affifted the land- 
holders to preferve their tenants from perilhing. Every he- 
ritor exerted himfelf to the utmoft of his ability in importing 
meal, which was fold out in fuch proportions as were thought

Eagles, corbies, and crov;s, often do grent damage to the 
corn and young Iambi. A price has been let upon them 
by the commillioners of fupply, viz. 5 s. for the head of an 
eagle, 4 d for a-corby's head, and 2 d. for a crow's This 
reguhtio i ha-, made thefe birds of prey lefs "numerous than 
they formerly w^re. Plovers, fnipes, and ducks of all kinds 
abound, but no mborfoo!, hare*, or- partridges. The migra- 
tory bird% are, the chalder, refembling th; lapwing. In mild 
feafbnsthey appear in the month of January. Sometimes not 
til! the beginning of March, and dilappe.ar in the month of 
September Swans appear ;n great flo-.ks in Ipring, in their 
courfc to the eaftward, and in autumn on their return. They 
reft themfelves for feveral days on our lochs and voes, but 
none bring forth their young in this country. K'ttyweaks

Naine^ Situation^ Extent, and Ssih 

THE name of this parifli feems to be derived from 
the faint to whom the church was dedicated, viz. 
St Irenaeus, Biflaop of Lyons, whofe fame for piety was 
at that time great throughout Chriftendom. What ferves 
to confirm this origin of the name is, that the fifhermen, 
who have marked out the fteeple of this church for a meath 
or mark to direft them at fca, call it St Irnie to this day ; 
and the eftate which lies clofe by the church is called Irnie- 
hill ; but, by the tranfpofition of the letter i, Rinnie-hill. What 
adds to the probability of this interpretation, is a traditioa 
ftill exifting here, that the devotees at Anltruther, who could 
not fee the church of Kilrenney till they travelled up the fi- 
fing ground to what they called the Hill, then pulled off 
their bonnets, fell on their knees, crofled themfelves, and 
prayed to St Irnie. '. ■ 

This parifh lies in the county and fynod of Fife, and preC- 
bytery of St Andrews. It is about 2 miles long, and 2 broad, 
almoft in the form of a circle, fomewhat elliptical on the coaft. 
It is bounded by Grail on the eaft j Anftruther on the weft ;

Deninno on the north and one continued ridge of blacl^ 
rocks, that fet bounds to the fea, on the fouth. The ground 
rifes gradually from fouth to north, and forms fuch a decli- 
vity as is a barrier to inundation. After a ftorm, abundance 
of fea weeds are thrown on the fhore, which lerve for ma- 
nure. The land, at an average, lets at 40 s. an acre. 

J^i/j. — The incumbent was born, and has fpent the greateft 
part of his life, in this parifti ; and, within his remembranccj 
vaft quantities of large cod, ling, haddocks,, herrings, holi- 
but, turbot, and mackarel, have been caught here j but the 
fiflieries are now mifcrably decayed. He can remember, when 
he was a young man, that he numbered no lefs than 50 
large fifliing boats, that required 6 men each, belonging 
to the town of Cellardykes, all employed in the herring 
fifhery in the fummer feafon. He can recolleft that he faw 
fuch a number 0/ boats throwing their nets at one time as 
he could not number, but heard that the Collector of the 
Cuftoms at Anftruther at that time, who kept an account of 
them, faid they amounted to 500, being gathered together 
from all quarters to this fhore ; and the winter fifhery was 
proportionally great. He has feen 10 or 12 large boats come 
kite the harbour in one day, fwiming to the brim with large 
cod, befides 30, 40, or 50, ftrung upon a rope faftened to 
the ftern, which they took in tow ; and, what will hardly be 
credited, many a large cod's head lying for dung on the land. 
At that time, a gentleman in Dunbar had the largeft cod in 
tack for 4 d. each, on this provifo, that every inhabitant of 
the parifli (hould be at hbercy to pick the beft fifh for their 
own ufe at his price ; and of all the thoufands he ever faw, 
the largeft were bought for 4 d. At that time, he remem- 
bered no lefs than 24 fmall brewers in the town of Cellar- 
dykes, probably, fo called from a range of cellars along the

fliore, built for preparing fifli for exportation, but now they 
are reduced to two or three, owing to the decay of the fiOae- 
ry. So ftrong is the contrafl: between that time and this, 
that not only few or no fifli are caught, but, to the amaze- 
ment of every body, the haddocks feem to have deferted this 
coaft 5 and for two years paft it has become a rarity to fee 
one. 

Population. — The population of this parifh has confiderably 
decreafed within thefe 30 years. According to Dr Webfter's 
ftate of the population, the number of inhabitants was 1348, 
The nnmbers have been diminiflied by the decay of the fifhe- 
ry and the union of farms.

Prices of Provifiotis. — The incumbent remembers, that, 
Xj\\en the filhermen ufed to lay up their winter provifions, 
they bought beef for a merk Scots a ftone ; a good hen 
wrs got for 4d.; a pound of butter for 3id.; and other 
vidluals in proportion : Now, 4 d. a pound is paid at all fea- 
fons of the year for beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork ; a 
pound of butter cofts 8 d. ; a hen i s. ; and the price of geefe, 
ducks, &amp;c. is proportionally raifed. 

Stipend, t^c — The value of the ftlpend, including the glebe, 
amounts to L. 100 Sterling. Sir John Anftruther of An- 
ftruther is patron. Of 9 heritors only 3 refide. The manfe 
was originally built by Mr James Melvil, an eminent refor- 
mer. On the lower lentile of the higheft window, which 
direilly overlooks the town, he ordered this infcription to be 
made, «« The Watch Tower," which remains diftin^t to this 
day. 

Rent. — The valued rent is L. 8470 Scots. The real rent 
is difficult to be precifeJy afcertained ; but it may be ftated 
at L 21^5 Sterling. 

School. — The fchoolmafter is accommodated with a neat 
little houfe, fronting the public ftreet, containing a fchool 
room and kitchen on the ground floor, 2 rooms and a clofet

Antiquities. — On the eaftern extremity of the parifli, at the 
very verge of the fea mark, is a cave, which feems to have 
been the habitation of fpme folitary faint in the days of old. 
The fucceflive tenants of this manfion have left figures of crof.

Name, Situation, Extent^ and Soil. 

TH E antient as well as the modern name given to this 
parilh is Arngafk. The name of the farm which iri- 
-cludes the hill on wliich the church ftands, is the fame 
with that of the parifli. From this farm the parifh proba- 
bly derived its name, which is defcriptive of the nature of 
the parlfli, and is entirely compofed of hills. It is com- 
pounded of Arn, which is probably derived from the Latin 
word Arvum, and gajk, which is commonly underllood to 
iignify what is large. Arngafk may hence fignify elevated 
or large arable land ; and, in truth, the hills in this parifh 
are alinoft all capable of culture. The parifli is in the pref- 
bytery of Perth, and the fynod of Perth and Stirling. It is 
nearly of a circular form, and about 4 miles in diameter. It 
is bounded by the pariflies of Strathmigio, Abernethy, Dron, 
Forgandenny, Forteviot, and Orwel. In this parifli there is 
a confiderable variety of foil. Upon feme of the hills it is 
light and fhallow ; but there are feveral banks of very rich 
fertile ground, capable of producing almofl: any crop. The 
hills are generally green, and afford excellent pafl:ure. There 
p more land in pafture than in tillage in this parifl;. There 

2xp 



are two or three moors, moftly covered with heath ; and 
there is very little meadow ground in the parifli. The 
arable ground is let at more than 20 s. an acre. It is not 
many years fmce the practice of incloiing began here ; and it 
is only a few years fmce grafs was fown. Seed time, if the 
feafon anfwers, begins in March or April, and harveft in Sep- 
tember and October. The parifh- fupplies itfelf with the ne- 
ceffaries of life ; and fends to market corn, butter, cheefe, 
fowls, cattle, and fome fheep. 

A\r^ and Dljlempers. — The air is pure and wholefome. The 
inhabitants are not opprefled with excefiive heat in fummer, 
nor do they fufFer intenfe cold in winter, as the hoar froft is 
lefs frequent and fevere than in low places. The moft com- 
mon diftempers are colds, which in feveral inftances termi- 
nate in confumptions. The fcurvy is likewife a common dif- 
order, which originates, as is fuppoled, from the frequent uic 
of oat meal. Agues were frequent fome years ago ; but there 
has not been a fingle perfon afflifted with that difeafe fince

Including herds, there are 59 male, and 35 female fervants,

almoft all of them fobcr and decent. 

Poor. — ^There are 7 poor people, who are every month fup- 
plied with a quantity of meal. The higheft allowance is 8 
pecks ; the loweft %. Money is alfo diftributed to fomc of 
them occafionally. About J 6 acres of land were purchafed 
by the feflion, for the benefit of the poof, in 1726, at 2600 
merks; They now let for L. 15 Sterling per annum. This, 
with L. 4 : 5 : o Sterling, the intereft of a fund, with what 
arifes from the ufe of the mort-cloth, and ihe ordinary col- 
ledlions at the church, conftitute all that is applied to the re* 
lief of the poor. The colleflion at the church from Whit- 
funday 1789 till Whitfunday 1790, amounted to L. 8 : o : 10 
Sterling. In 1782 and 1783, the managers of the poors 
funds collected a voluntary contribution through the parifli 
for fuch of the lower ranks as were in diftreffed circum- 
ftances.

Church aiid Stipeijd,—?zrt of the church, at leaft, muii 
have been built before the Reformation, as there is a place 
4n the wall for the font ; and the ftatue of the foundrefs (faid 
to have been a Mrs Barclay) has the beads ufeu by Catholics 
^hanging round the hands. The church was originally a cha- 
pel, built for the accomraodation of the family of Balvaird, 
and their dependants. The ftipend is L. 513 : 19 : 3 Scots, 
with 30- bolls and 1 firlot of meal ; the glebe is Icarcejy worth 
L. 6 Sterling i iq that when th« meal fells at i6s. a boll, the 
flipend, including the glebe, will amount to about L. 70 Ster- 
ling. The manle was repaired about 10 years ago. The 
church has got few repairs for thefe laft 1 00 years. Meflrs 
David and Adam Low of Eaft Fordel are joint patrons. 

JMifcellamous Ohfervations, — ^There is one quarry of good 
whin-ftone in the parifli, and more might be difcovered if 
the ground were dug to a fulScient depth. After much rain, 
the river comes down with great force. It is faid, that, in 
the place where a barley mill now ftands, a fulling mill was 
entirely fwept away by a flood- There are about 52 ploughs 
in this parifli ; many of them are drawn by oxen ; but the 
number of fuch ploughs is gradually diminifliing. There is 
only I two-wheeled chaife. A very fmall hill ftands near 
Damhead, between the new road to Kinrofs and the water of 
Farg, which is called Gallow-Hill, where it is faid flood a

highway between Perth and Queensferry pafies through this 
parifh. Many of the roads are in a ftate of nature. The in- 
habitants highly approve of turnpikes : Some pay the ftatutc- 
labour half in kind and half in money. There are 3 coun- 
ties which meet in this parifh ; the county of Fife to the eaft,

'Situation, Extent, and Name. 

THIS parjfli is fituated In the county of Forfar. It is 
15 miles to the north-eaft of Dundee, 9 north-weft of 
'Arbroath, and fouth-eaft from Forfar. It is bounded on 
the eaft by the parilh of Forfar; on the north by Recobiej 
■on the fouth by Carmiflie ; and on the fouth and eaft by the 
parilhes of Kirkden and Recobie. It contains about 3200 
Scots acres. It takes its name from the largell hill in the 
parifli. Dun, a Gaelic word, is invariably applied in Scot- 
land to hills on which Ibme caftle, or place of ftrength, has 
Itood 5 Ic/jfn is unknown, but probably a proper name. On 
the ibuth lide of the hill is an eminence, vow called Cafhelis, 
■or Caltle-hill, with vifible remains of the foundation of Ibmc 
antient building. The only other hill in this panlh is called 
13umbarrow, probably from having been the burial place of 
fome perion of eminence. A rock on its north fide is iiWi 
called Arthur's Seat. This hill is not fo high as thac of Uun- 
nichen. The hill of Dunnichen was lately mealurcd with 
grt • geometric.:": accuracy. The mill ftream of Muirton 
fuamg iuVd, at the bafe of the hill, is 2co feet above low wa- 
ter mark in the harbour of Arbroath ; and the height from

rife about 80 or 100 feet j fo that the height of the hill iff 
about 700, or 720 feet above the level of the fea. The hill 
of Dunnichen runs about 3 miles, in a fouth-eafl direffion 
its fummit forming the northern boundary of the parifh. 
The parifli extends, from eaft to weft, about 4 miles, and 
from fouth to north, in one place, about 3 miles, narrowing, 
a little to the eaftward.

The foil, in general, is fertile, producing wheat, flax, oats, 
and barley. The leafons are late, on account of its elevation,' 
One ticld is now fown with wheat near the fummit of the hill 
of Dunnichen, and at leaft 500 feet above the level of the 
fea; no rinall proof of the poflibility of extending agriculture 
fuccefsfully on the fides of the Jiigh hilk of Scotland. Dun- 
nichen, containing about 50 acres, is in the center of the pa- 
rifli* The mofs of it was drained about 30 years ago, aAd 
now affords a large fuppiy of peats : in all probability it will 
furnifli the neighbourhood with fuel for about 30 years long- 
er, and may then be made a rlcii meadow. The rert of the- 
fuel is coal, brought by land from the port of Arbroath; and' 
a fmall lupply from c.\cenlive fir plantations, about 30 years

Rivers, l^c. — ^This parifli contains no river nor lake. It 
13 watered by one fmall brook, called Vinny, fome fay Finny^ 
-or Attle, which takes its rife in a neighbouring mofs. It 
runs from weft to eaft, along the fouth bafe of the hill of 
Duimichen, and in its courfe turns one flax n^ill, and one 
mill for wafhing yarn. It joins Lunan water about 4 miles 
below. The burn of Craichy, which forms one of its four- 
ces, turns a corn mill. It contains fome trout, much dimi- 
riifhed of late in their number, by flax being fteeped in and 
near its ftream. A fniall brook runs out of the mofs of 
Dunnichen, and falls into Vinny at the ealiern extremity of 
the parifli. 

ManiifaBitresy Villages^ and Fairs, — Many weavers, princi- 
][)ally of courfe linen, inhabit this parifli. An attempt is now 
making to introduce the manufacture of coarfe cottons. Dun- 
nichen is itfclf a very fmall village, confifting of the houfes of 
the proprietor, the manfe, a public houfe, and the houfes of 
a few mechanics and labourers, not exceeding 14 in all. To 
the eaftward is the village of Drimmitormont, a very old vil- 
lage, inhabited by v^eavers, each of whom occupy fix or eight 
acres of land. In the year 1788, a farm of 66 acres, called 
Letham, has been laid out by the proprietor of Dunnichca 
for a village. Streets have been marked out on a regular 
plan, and lots of any extent are let upon perpetual leafes, at 
the rate of L. 2 an acre. It contains already about 20 families,, 
and new houfes are rifing on it daily, the fituation being fa- 
vourable for fuch a pbn, by having Vinny water on the fouth^ 
the perennial brook of Dunfiithen mofs running through it., 
plenty of freeftcnes on the farm itfelf, and thriving woods 
iind a mols in its neighbourhood. Here a fair or market has 
lately begun to be held, once a fortnight, on Thurfdays, for 
the fale of cloth, yarn, and flax j and L. 400 or L. 500 are 

fome- 



%2k Smi/iical Accomt 

'fometimes returned in one market-day. An old eftablifiied 
fair is annually held at Dunnichen, on the 2d Wednefday of 
March, old ftyle, called the fair of St Caufnan. It is a tojr 
fair, at which neithci- hbrfes, corn, nor cattle, are fold. 

Church and Stipend. — The church is fiiiall and old. It wai 
dedicated to St Caufnan. There are fome doubts, even in 
the Popifh kalendar, of the exiftence of this faint, although a. 
large well near the church alfo bears his name ; and the 
falls of fnow, whicli generally happen in March all over Great 
Britain, is in this neighbourhood called St Caufnan's Flaw. 
The minifter's ftipend is about L. 70 a year, paid chiefly ih 
oat- meal and barley, befides a glebe of 4 arable acres, and 2 
acres bf grafs ground. 

School. — There Is a parifh fchobl here. The fchoolmaf- 
ter's falary is L. 8 : 6 : o yearly, with a houfe, fchool-houfe, 
and kitchen-garden. The prefeht fchoolmafter, by his afll- 
duous application to the duties of his olBce, has raifed a cori- 
fiderable fchool, having feldom fewer than 50 or 60 fcholars, 
whom he teaches to read and write Englifn, arithmetic, and 
Latin, when any of the children require that branch of edtl- 
(cation. 

State of the Poor^ Pardchial Funds, and Records. — There 
may be about a dozen of poor and indigent perfons belong- 
ing to this parifli, principally reduced to poverty by old age 
Or difteihpers. A fufficient fund for their maintenance arifts 
from the voluntary contributions of the parifhioiiers, collefte"d 
on Sundays, and at the time of the facrament. It amounts at 
prefent to about L. 20 Sterling a year, and is yearly incre^* 
ling ; and from it a referve of L. 52 : I : 10 has hccn r.-.iidc 
as a provifion for bad feafons. Of thefe poor pecnie h\nc 



()f Dunmchen* 



receive a quarterly, and fome a weekly allowance, according 
as their neceffities require. The fund is managed by the 
clergyman and kirk-fefiion, who being intimately acquainted 
with the circumftances of every poor perioo in the r Ih, 
are enabled thereby to proportion the lupply to their wants 
and exigencies. 

This parifh affords one, among perhaps many inftances ii^ 
Scotland, how fafely the maintenance of the poor may be left 
to the humane and charitable difpofition of the people, and, 
how unneceflary it is to call in polltive laws to their affift- 
ancc ; for, if fuch laws provide fui^ds for tnaintaining the 
poor, they alfo provide poor for confuming the funds. 

Population. — ^This parifh has much increafed in its popula- 
tion fince the returns made to Dr Webfter about 40 years 
ago, and it ftill continues on the increafe. At the above 
mentioned period, it contained only 612 inhabitants ; where- 
as it appears, from a furvey made hft year, that their number 
amounts to 872, whereof 75 belong to the anti-burgher 
meetings of Forfar and Dumbarrow. An abllraft of the mar- 
riages, baptifms, and burials, for the laft ten years, is fub- 
joined. ^

Mode of Culiivatian and Produce. — This parifh, like the reft 
of the country, has of late received confiderable improve- 
ments in agriculture. About 30 years ago, the old fyftem 
began to be altered. Leafes, which formerly were few, and 
feldom granted for a longer term than 9 years, have lately 

beeii

been granted for 19 years, and the life of the tenant, and 
fonie for longer and more indefinite terms. On the principal 
eftate in the parifh called Dunnichen all fervitudcs were abo- 
lifhed, viz. thirlagc to the mill and blackfmith's fnops, car- 
riages, and bonnage, si word of Gothic extraction, which 
means fliearing corn. Money-rent was fublVituted in the 
place of oat-meal, barley, kane-fowls *, yarn, and mill-fwine. 
The farms were inclofed with fences of free-flone. Better 
houles and offices were built. The breed of cattle and hor- 
fes was improved Turnip, potatoes, kale, and clover and 
Tye-gra(s, were planted and fown for winter provifion. The 
diftint^ion of out and infield was laid afide, and all tlie fields 
were crept and cultivated in due rotation. But thefe im- 
provements were much facilitated by means of a valuable ma- 
nure which began to be ufed about that time in this and the 
neighbouring parilhes, viz. fhcU marl, to which the late 
confiderable increafe of the value of the lands may in a great 
meafure be afcribed. This valuable manure being found in 
greater plenty in this neighbourhood than any where elfe in 
the kingdom, or even perhaps in the known world, it may 
not be thought impertinent to deicribe it more particularlv. 
About two miles north from Dunnichen, there arc a chain 
of lochs which abound with marl, viz. the lochi. of Forfar, 
Reftineth, Recobic, and Balgavies, In t.iefe lochs, it lay 
long an inacceffible treafure, till, about forty- five year; aro, 
Captain Strachau, proprietor of the loch of ]alg:ivics, began 
to drag it, much in the fame manner that ballait is dragged 
from the bed of the river Thame:. This he performed with 
fo much fuccefs, as not only amply to (uppiy his own farms, 
but to have a futplus for his neighbours. His example was

fo(if! followed on the ether lochs ; and, about 30 years ago, 
the late Earl of Strathmore, by means of a drain, lowered the 
furf ce of the water of the loch of Forfar, thereby opening a 
ftili .r.ore extenfive fupply of marl ; and, in the year 1790, 
Mr Dempfter of Dunnichen drained the loch and mofs of 
Rcltineth, by which an inexhauftible mafs of fliell-marl has 
bee;i made acceflible. Marl is fold at 8 d. a boll, contain- 
ing 8 Jolid feet j fixty bolls are commonly u fed for the firft 
dreffing of an acre of land. Its qualities are precifely the 
fame with thofe of lime Which of thefe manures is prefe- 
rable, has been long a fubjeft of frequent difpute among the 
farmers ; but the chemical analyfis of marl (hews clearly that 
marl is in every relpt£t the fame with lime, and poflelles the 
additional advantage of being found in a pulverifed ftate, and 
requiring no calcination previous to laymg it on the land. 
The fimilarity of the two has been ftill farther evinced by Mr 
Dentpfler having conftrufted a kiln on a plan fuggefted by 
Dr Black • for calcining marl, which, after calcination, 

makes 

* The conftrudlion of the kiln, and method of calcining the 
marl, will appear from the following extract from a letter of l)r 
Black's to George Dcmpfter, Efq; dated 28th November 1789. 

*« There is no doubt but that fuch marl as you defcribe may 
be burned to very good lime, if the proper degree of heat can 
be applied to it In a country where the only fuel is peat. I 
have no hopes of fuccefs with the Reverberatory With fuch 
fuel, in fuch a furnace, it w.uld be expenfivc beyond meafurc, 
and perhaps impraflirable, to produce the nece/fary degree of 
heat. Neither is the experiment likeiy to fucceed in a draw- 
kiln, in which lo much dull and rubbilh muft be produced by 
the defcent of the lime, and attrition of the mafTe'. againlf one 
another, that the paflages for the air would be too much ob- 
ftrn(51ed. But, in a kdn in which the mafTes of marl would be 
little difturbed, the operation might fucceed very well. 1 would 
therefore prepare the marl as the harder kinds of pcac are pre- 
pared ia fome places, by laying it, while foft, on a plot of 



of 'Dunnkhen 



makes a very flrong cement, fhe calcination of marl will, it 
is hoped, prove an uleful difcovery in this neighbourhood, to 
which other lime muft be fetched from the diftancc of 14 or 
J 6 Aniles. 

The improvements made in this parifli have been princi- 
pally confined to the eflates of Dunnichen and Dumbarrow. 
Dunnichen paid, about 30 years ago, nearly L. 300 of yearly 

rent, 

grafs, and forming it into a bed feme inches thick ; this bed, 
while dryinc;, may be a little compared, by beating it with the 
flat of the fpade or fhovel, and, before it be quite dry, it may be 
cut into pieces of the lizc of peats. The belt kiln for burning it 
Ihould have nearly the fhape of a draw kiln, or fliould have a 
much dteper cylindrical cavity ih m the vulgar kilns in which 
lime is burnt ; it may be fiom 20 to 30 feet deep, and from 8 
to 9 feet in diameter ; the top of it fliould be covered with a 
dome or arch, having an opening at top, 3 feet diametei , to 
Jet out the fmoke, &amp;c. and a door in the fide of this dome for 
introducing the materials ; at the bottom, where the kiln is a 
little contracted, Ihouid be a grate 5 feet fquare, the bars of 
which being loofe, might be drawn out occafionally. In char- 
ging this kiln, lay tiril 18 inches depth of peats over the whole 
grate, then throw in prepared marl and peats intermixed until 
the kiln is filled to the top, and at the top of all there fliould be 
fome peats without any marl ; then Ihut up the door at the top 
of the kiln with Rones and mud, and throw in the kindling at 
the vent of the dome. The fire will be flowly communicated 
from the top to the bottom, fo as to charr the whole pe .ts, and 
to expel the remains of humidity from the malfes of marl ; and 
this will be accon.panied with very little confumption c.t' the in- 
flammable matter ; but, when the whole is ch,-.: red, it will be- 
gin to burn with abundance of iieit, firit at the bottom, and 
gradually upwaids, until all the peats are completely coniumed. 
The,;, by dravving the bars of the grate, the kiln may be drawn. 
1 c inot lay what proportion the peats iliould bear to the marl, 
bui am of opinion that a very moderate proportion may be luf- 
ficiei:t in the middle and upper parts of the kiln. To kiiow 
whether the marl is thoroughly burnt, flake the lim» wi' h wa- 
ter when frcfli drawn from the kifn, and f y if the iliU-J liine 
will diiTolve in aquafoitis, or Jpirit of fait, without effervcf- 
^ence."

rent, in corn, money, and other articles, in kind. The farm- 
buildings were ruinous hovels the ground was over-ruu 
with broom, and furz or whins, and many parts of the arable 
land were wet and boggy, and all without trees. It has, 
fmce that time, been drained and inclofed. Moft of the 
muirs, which make a fifth part of the eftate, have been 
planted with thriving timber. The fence s of .Tiany of the 
fields are furrounded v/ith hedge-row trees. The hind ha^ 
betn marled. The prefent rents may be fully treble the 
former. The arable ground now lets, when out of leafe, 
from L. 1 to L. I : 10 : o per acre. The me.inefl cottager 
is now better lodged than the former principal tenants. 
Wheat grows well on feveral of the farms. There is no 
where better flax, turnips, potatoes, and artificial gralTes. 
There arc feveral different fyfteuis of cropping the ground. 
The rotation of the befl Lmd is oats, flax or fallow for wheat 
with dung, barley, and iown down with grafs feeds, grafs 
for the three or four following years. A fecond rotation is, 
two crops tif oats, a crop of barley, a green crop, a crop of 
oats or barley, with dung, and lown down with grafs-leeds, 
bay cut one year, and the grafs paft^ired three or four. Ten 
boils of wheat are railed on an acre, and fixteen ftone of 
fcutched flax *. The inclofed fields are let for 40 or 50 s. 
an acre for paRure, and for L. 5 an acre for flax. Compoft 
dunghilis are in general ufe, with a certain proportion of 
marl, about 8 or 10 bolls to an acre, vyhich is found to an- 
fwer well; and it is generally now underflood that, if fields 
are not over-cropr, they cannot be over-maried. It is diffi- 
cult to afcertain accurately the inr reafed produce of an acre, 
in confequence of the improved agriculture. But it is uni- 
vcrfally allowed that the farmers v.-ere poorer when the rent

Minerals. — Little fearch has been made for minerals vk 
ibis parifti. The moft valuable is free or gr.t ftone ; it is 
«afily quarried, and is found in erery part of the hill of l)im- 
nichen, and other par s of the pari(h, and is very fit for build- 
ing houfes and ftone- fences. A few ftrata of whin-ftones 
appear in fomc places, and a coarle iron-bar in the hill. No 
fymptom of coal has as yet difcovered itfelf any where in this 
county. 

Air and Climate. — The air of this parifli is fuppofed to be 
remarkably healthy, from the many old people in it j and the 
climate is nearly the lame with that of all the eaftern coaft of 
the ifland. In the fpring, and beginning of fummer, eafterly 
winds gaieraliy prevail after mid-day, attended with chilli- 
nels, and lometimes fogs, though in a lefs degree than nearer 
the coaft of the German Ocean. The heavieft rains come in 
autumn and winter, from the fouth-eaft, attended by violent 
winds, which laft lometimes two or tlxrce days, and occur 
twice or thrice in the year. 

Antiquiiies.'-^There are only a few antient tumuli or bar- 
rows in the parifh, which, when opened, are found to con- 
tain human bones, in rough ftone coffins. Pots of a coarfe 
earthen ware are alfo Ibmetlmes found in them. Neither 
coins nor arms have as yet been difcovered in or near them, 
tb affift our conjeflures as to their date. In the mols of 
Dunnichen have been found very large roots of oak trees, 
and fome horns of the red- deer, and alfo a ftratum of coarfe 
marl, below the mofs, and fix feet under fand.

High Roads. — The late a£l obtained two years ago, for e- 
refting turnpikes on the great roads, and for commuting into 
money the ftatute labour for improving the parochial roads, 
promifes foon to elFe£l a thorough reformation on the 
roads of this country. The commutation has nearly quadru- 
pled the efFetStive labour applicable to the roads, and this 
muft be employed within the parifh where it is levied. The 
proprietor of Dunnichen intrurts the application of the fund 
to the princij-al farmers in the parifli, who are far from 
grudging to pay a tajc from which they reap fo niuch bene- 
fit. Many of the roads have, in the firft year of the tax, 
been formed, and the dangerous parts amended. The fum 
levied in this parifti is about L. 27 Sterling yearly, and that 
of the whole county exceeds L. 2000 a year. Turnpike 
roads, between Cupar of Angus, Forfar, Arbroath, Dundee, 
Cupar of Angus, aad Meigle, and from Dundee to Montrofe, 
are in great forwardnefs, and will probably be fully com- 
pleted in the courfe of this and the next fummer, in fpite of 
fome antient prejudices, by which their progrcfs has been 
conliderably retarded. 

Jlli/cel/aneot/s Ohfcrvatlons. — The fmall-pox frcc^^uently pro- 
ving fatal to the children of the parifh, Dr John Adam of 
Forfar has attended fome days this fpring tor inoculating 
all the children of the parffh gratis. But, although this mca- 
fure was publicly recommended in church by the minifter, 
and privately by the whole kirk-feffion, yet, fo ftrongly do 
the antient prejudices prevail againft this mode of communi- 
cating the didemper, that only nine or ten children have 
been inocnldted. I'hey have all recovered ; and it is hoped 
that inoculation will ibori become general in the parifh, from 
the fuccefs with whicii this firll experitiient has been attend- 
ed.

Although the granting of leafes for nineteen years, at leaft, 
is now become univerfal, yet there prevails a confiderable di- 
verfity of opinion among proprietors of land as to the expe- 
tliency of including the life of the farmers in their leafes. 
Some advantages, however, feem to give a decided preference 
to this laft fort of kafe. The tenant knows he is fettled for 
life, and is therefore afraid to over-crop his land, left he 
fhould thereby injure himfelf. Many law-fuits are thereby 
avoided on this fubjc£t. The tenant is alfo fuppofed to be 
more attentive to the repairs of his buildings and fences ; and 
he certainly requires a much lefs vigilant infpeaion on the 
part of the proprietor, or his faftor. 

In order to protect the newly planted trees round" the 
farmer's inclofcJ field";, the proprietor of Dunnichen has gi- 
ven the heirs of the tenants a right to one third part of them, 
at the expiration of the leale ; and he engages not to profc- 
cute the tenants for any accidental dammage the trees may 
fuffer from cattle, or otherwife. The tenants on thi eftate 
confider the trees as a part of their own property, and are at 
pains to proteft them from inj: ry, and to have other trees 
planted in the room of fuch as have fufFered. A fenfible 
warmth is derived to the fields from fuch of thefe fence-rows 
as have been planted fifteen or twenty yea 's ago. 

It is apprehended, until farms are tranfrnitted from father 
to fon, like an inheritance, as is much the caie in England, 
agriculture will not attain all the perfection of which it is 
capable. Veteres migrate coloni^^ is an odious mandate, mark- 
ing bad times for the country. When leaf,^s are granted for 
'the tenant's life, he has a chance of getting his Ton's life ad- 
ded to his own, by paying a moderate fine to the proprietor. 



When

When the eflate was begun to be improved, many of the 
tenants were unable and averfe to the modern fyftem. Theft 
tvere generally left in polfeflion of their houfes, with a fmall 
portion of land, on a leafe for their own life and that of their 
wives. The remainder of the ground was laid out into new 
farms, and let to more enterprizing tenants. 

It may not be improper to explain the meaning of fome 
words ufed in this account, which, though well underftood at 
prefcnt, will require to be explained to after generations, full 
as much as the moft barbarous cuftoms of our ruder anceftors 
require to be explained to us. 

Th'irlage *. — When the proprietor of a barony or eftate 
builds a corn- mill on it, he obliges all his tenants to em- 
ploy that mill, and no other, and to pay fometimes nearly 
double what the corn might be ground for at another mill. 
As this fervitude tends to make millers carelefs and faucy, 
it will without doubt foon be univerfally aboHlhed. 

^middy or Smithes Shop, — Formerly one bhckfmith, wh« 
was alfo a farrier, was only allowed to exercife his buGncfs 
or\ a barony or eftate. He had the exclufive privilege of 
doing all the blackfmith and farrier work. For this he paid 
a (mail rent to the proprietor, and every tenant paid him a 
certain quantity of corn. About thirty years ago, a perfon 
cf this defcription had this fole right on the barony of Dun- 
nichen, for which he paid L. i yearly.

t1ie tenants are bound to uig, to dry, and to fetch home and 
build up, as much peat as is iieceffary for the proprietor's fu- 
el through the year. In this manner the tenants are em- 
ployed during moft part oi the fummer. It prevents thenx 
from fallowing and clean'..;;/ their grounds, fetching manures 
from a diftance, fowing turnip, &amp;c. On other eftates, it is 
the duty of the tenants to carry out and fpread the dung for 
manuring the proprietor's land in the feed time, which fre- 
quently interferes with his own work of the fame kind. It 
is alfo the duty of the tenants to fetch from the neighbour- 
ing fea-ports all the coal wanted for the proprietor's ufe. The 
tenants are alfo bound to go a certain number of errands, 
Ibmetimes with their carts and horfes, and fometimes a-foot, 
a certain number of long errands, and a certain number of 
ihort ones, are required to be performed, A long errand 
is what requires more than one day. This is called carriage. 
Tenants are alfo expected to work at any of the proprietor's 
work a certain number of days in the year. In fome places, 
this obligation, it is faid, extends to 52 days, or a day in the 
week. 

Bonnage — is an obligation, on the part of the tenant, to cut 
down the proprietor's corn. This duty he muft perform 
when called on. It fometimes happens, that, by cutting 
down the proprietor's crop, he lofes the opportunity of cut- 
ting down his own. 

This whole catalogue of cuftoms is fo adverfe to agricul- 
ture, and to the true interefts of the proprietor, that, in a 
Ihort time, their very names will probably be obfolete, and 
t\\t nature of them forgotten.

the bounds of the parifti, yet, being connected with it, ought 
to be mentioned. In the year 1788, MrWhitworth the en- 
gineer was employed to take a furyey of the country, for the 
purpofe of bringing a navigable canal from the port of Ar- 
broath to Forfar. That gentleman made out an accurate plan 
of this canal, which he reported to be highly prafticable. It 
required 25 locks to condud it from Muirton Fulling Mill to 
Arbroath J the diftance 13 miles i firlong and 2 chains j 
the perpendicular height above low water-mark 196 feet. 
The expence he computed at L. 17,788 : 17 : 8. As there 
is no reafon to believe the trade on this canal would at pre- 
fent defray this expence, the plan is laid afide, and the fur- 
veyor's Report is depofited in the town-clerk's offices in For- 
far and Arbroath. This ufeful work will probably be refu-? 
med again when the country fhall have attained more wealth, 
and further improvements. It would ferve to convey coalj 
lime, and wood, into the center of a very populous country 
deftitute of th^fe articles. </p>

t»ARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5043747">CARMYLIE</name>. 

By the Rev. Mr Patrick Brtce,</head> 

<p>

Origin ef the Name. 
^"IT^ H E parifh of Carmylie furnifties very little fcope for 
ftatiftical inquiry. The origin of the name cannot 
tiow be afcertained. In foine antient records of the prefljy* 
tery it is called Carmylie, probably from the high grounds 
Which compofe the greateft part of it : But this is merely 
conjectural. Previous to the period of the Reformation, the 
church was a chapel, built by the heritor of the eftate of Car- 
mylie, where the IMonks from the Abbey of Aberbrothock, 
in its vicinity, "performed divine fervice, according to the rites 
of the Church of Rome, in their courfes. It was eredled in- 
to a parochial charge, after the Reform, tion, by the Lords 
CommifEotiers for Plantation of Kirks» 

Situation^ Eittent, and ProduBiom. — The parifli is fituated in 
the county of Forfar, prefbytery of Aberbrothock, and fynod 
of Angus and Mearns. It is of an oblong form ; furround- 
ed by the parifties of Panbride, Guthrie, Monikie, Kirkden, 
Dunnichen, Inverkillor, St Vlgians, and Arberlot. It is 
about 3 miles long, from eaft to weft, and about 4 miles 
broad. It may be called a hilly and mountainous tradl of

ground, when compared with the conterminous parifliei^ 
The land is wet and fpungy, and was thought, fome years 
ago, to be better adapted for pafture than for grain. About 
20 years ago, there were many farms in the parifh occupied 
by farmers in the neighbourhood, who ufed them for gra- 
zing their cattle in the fummer ; bat, ever finee that time,, 
the proprietors have obliged the tenants to refide on them j 
who, by driving lime and marl to their refpeclive farms, and. 
by draining their lands by funk fences, &amp;c. have greatly me- 
liorated the ground, and for fcveral years have raifed heavy 
crops; which, though they were not equal in quahty, yet, in 
quantity, were not inferior to thofe produced on the grounds 
in the neighbourhood, that have been long in a proper date 
of cultivation. On a very moderate computation, there is 
four times the quantity of grain, efpecially of barley, raifed 
in this parifh than there was 20 years ago. 

Re7t. — The land rent is fuppofed to be about L. 1000 
Sterling. It has rifen about a third within thefe lafl 20 years. 
There are only 3 heritors in the parilh, none of whom refide 
in it. 

Church and Siipefid, is'c. — ^The walls of the church were 
repaired about 40 years ago, and a new roof was thrown over 
it laft fummer. It is decently fitted up within for the ac- 
commodation of the congregation, who are a fober and in- 
duftrious people, and regular in their attendance on divine 
ordinances. The ftipend amounts to about 400 merks Scots 
in money, and a little more than 5 chalders of viflual. The 
manfe was built about 18 years ago. There are very good 
funds for the poor ; and they are liberally provided for with- 
out any aflclTment oq the heritors,- 



ef Carmylie, 433^ 

Poputation. — The population of the parlfli, as returned to 
Dr Webfter about 40 years ago, was 730 fouls. It has fince 
rather decreaied. Some mechanics, efpecially weavers, have 
removed to the trading boroughs of Dundee and Aberbrothockj, 
where they meet with good encouragement from the manu- 
facturing companies in thefe towns. Its inhabitants may now 
amount to about 700. The number of burials do not exceed 
15 or 18 yearly. The births are from 20 to 24 annually. 
There are very few dificnters in the parifh not exceeding 
20. There is only 1 brewer ; 4 perfons retail ale. 

ScheoL-^HhtxQ. is a parochial fchoolmafter here. His fa- 
iary is 100 merks Scots; a houfe, but no garden. The per-- 
quifites belonging to him are very inconfiderable. His whole 
income does not exceed L. 20 Sterling. He has about 50 
fcholars in winter, and 30 in fummer. Much praife is due 
to the people for promoting and encouraging the education 
af the youth of both fexes. They have fubfcribed a certain 
fum for building a fchool-houfe j and are determined to give 
every fupport in their power to the perfon who is to have 
the charge of inftru^ling the girls in the different- branches 
of needlework. 

Birds^ ^c. — The ^otterelsX birds of paflage, alight on the 
rifing grounds about the beginning of April, continue here 
about three weeks, remove to the Grampian Hills, about 12 
miles to the northward, and revifit this parifh about the be- 
ginning of Augurt : After abiding here about three weeks, 
rhey fly off to the fouthward, and are not fecn till the ifl of 
April following. There are quarries of grey flate and pave= 
nient ftones here, which have been wrought for fome centu- 
ries. They fiipply the neighbourhood, and are exported to 
Tiky Perthfhire, the Mearns, &amp;c.

Name, Situation, Extent, and Surface. 
HERE is reafon to believe that this parift was called 



A Panbridge about 200 years ago, and that it was an 
abreviation of Panbridget ; the church here, which is very 
old, being built by St Bridget, or at leaft in honour of her. 
An infcription has been feen on an old grave ftone, mention* 
ing that it was erefted in memory of fuch a perfon of the 
parilh of Panbridge. Pan is probably a corruption of the 
Latin word fanum ; if fo, Panbride fignifies Bridget's church. 
This parifh is fituated in the county of Forfar, in the fynod 
of Angus and Mearns, and in the prefbytery 6f Aberbrothock» 
It is more than 5 miles long, and about 2 broad. It is bound- 
ed by the fea on the fouth ; by the pariflies of Barrie and Mo- 
nikie on the weft ; by Carmylie on the north ; by Arbirlotc 
on the north eaft ; and a detached part of St Vigians on the 
fouth-eaft. The general appearance of the country here is 
rather flat than hilly ; but there is a confiderable declivity for 
fome miles from, the north to the fouth end of this parifli. 
The fliore is flat, and very rocky.

beggar in the parifli But, befides the ordinary poor, chere 
is a confiderabic number of houfeholders in indigeiit circum-

UNAN, antiently Lounan, or Inverlounan, is fo called 



-Lj from a river of that name, near the mouth of which 
the church ftands. The fource of the river is a quagmire, at 
a fmall village called Lunan-head, in the neighbourhood of 
Forfar ; the Gaelic word Laonon lignifying boggy or inarlhy 
ground. Lunan is fituated in the county of Forfar, prelby- 
tery of Aberbrothock, and fynod of Angus and Mearns. Ic 
is nearly a reilangle, about 2 miles long, and i broad, being 
one of the fmalleft parifties in the county It is bounded on the

The fituation is at once pleafant, and advantageous for agri- 
culture. The higher ground commands an extenfive view cf 
the country around, and of the German Ocean ; and the 
floping ground anfwers wrell for draining, vi^hich in many 
places is much wanted •, for the land abounds with boggs and 
fprings, or what hufbandmen call fpouts. The greateft part 
of the parifh ftands on rock of moor-ftone, commonly called 
fcurdy : It is of a dark blue colour, and of fo clofe a texture 
that water cannot penetrate it ; and the furface of the ground, 
efpecially during the winter months-, is confequently very 
loofe and wet. This rock is the only ftone found in the pa- 
rifh fit for building. It is quarried by blading with gun- 
powder, by which it is broke into fuch irregular pieces, ibat, 
unlefs the mafons be at uncommon pains, walls built of it are. 
not water tight. 

Soil, Product, Rent, i^fr, — The foil of the higher part of 
the parifli is frequently lhallow ; but of the lower, deep and 
rich, except a little on the fea-fliore, which is fandy. The 
land is on the whole fertile, and produces grain of the bell 
quality. The rent of the arable land is at prefent from 9 s, 
to 15 s. Sterling an acre, but will probably be raifed at the 
expiration of the prefent leafes, fome of which are not long. 
No value is put on warte or pafture ground. The valued 
rent of the parifh is L. 1550 Scots; the real rent about 
L. 525 Sterling. 

There are eight farms in the parldi, very different in fize 
and rent and this number has been the fame beyond the 
memory of man. Six of thefe farms, called the Barony of 
Lnnan, rueafuring 790 acres, including ip6 acres of moor, 
common 10 them all, belong to the Earl of Northcik. Ar-

lufcie, mcafuring 400 acres, including 180 acres of moor, or 
coarle pafture, belongs to Robert Stephen, Efq; of Letham. 
Lunan, meafuring 215 acres, including 62 acres of moor and 
wafte ground, belongs to Alexander Taylor Imray of Lunan. 
The whole parifli, accordingly, when the glebe is taken into 
the account, confifts of 973 acres arable, and 438 wafte land. 
Of thefe, 40 acres annually bear wheat, 187 barley, 270 oats, 
45 turnip or cabbage, jo potatoes or yams, 16 flax, 40 pcafe, 
324 fown grafs, and 40 lie fallow. Some tenants have made 
attempts to inclofe part of their farms wich fences of eartU 
topped with furze ; but few of them are fo complete as to 
anfwer the purpofes of a fence. The farmers appear fully 
fcnfible of the advantages of inclofures ; and mofi: of them 
in' the neighbourhood have begun to inclofe with ftone- 
walls ; a pra(fllce which would be generally adopted, were it 
not for the dilficulty in fome places of getting flones, and 
tlie fliortnefs of many leafe?, I he parifli does much more 
than fupply itfclf with provifions ; more tjian one Ijalf of 
the produce being annually carried to market, to which there 
is eafy accefs by the high road. This road, and the bridges 
•on it, were chiefly made, ^nd have been hitherto wholly kept 
in repair, by the ftatute labour, which was fometimes exarted 
in kind, and rometimes comiputed } but, by an aft of parlia- 
ment pafled 1790, it Avas made turnpike, which farmers at 
prefent confider as a very great grievance. The f^afon for 
fowing wheat is October; oats from the middle of March to 
the middle of April ; barley jh May ; and turnip in June. 
Hay and harvefl: time generally continue from July to Sep- 
tember. There are in the parilh 250 black cattle, 62 hcrfes, 
21 carts, and 16 ploughs, drawn ulually by 4 horfes or 4 
oxen, except in the feed time, when 2 horles only are ufcd ; 
and then the number of ploughs are about a third more. 



Prices 



444- Statijlical Account 

Price ef Provrfwns, Labour, Servants Wages, l3fc — Provi-' 
fions have rifen in price fince the commencement of the prc- 
fent century at leaft two-thirds, and in feme inftances more. 
Butcher meat is at prefent from 3 d. to 4 d. a pound ; chic- 
kens 3 d. a piece; hens and ducks 1 s. ; butter 9 d. and chcefe 
3 d. a pound. The wages of a mafon are is. 8 d. a day i 
of a carpenter l s. 4 d. ; of a taylor i s. ; or 6 d, with vi£i:uals j 
of a day labourer in hufbandry i s. The wages for harveft- 
Work of a man are from L, i : 5 : o to L. 1 : 10 : o ; of a wo- 
man from 18 s. to 20 s. The yearly wages of a male fervant 
are from L. 6 to L 8 ; of a female lervant L. 3. Servants 
wages are nearly trippled wirhin thrfe laft 50 years. Far- 
mers prefer men fervants who are -unmarried, to cottagers, 
chiefly becaufe thf^y are always at hand, while the cottagers 
go to their own houfes after the ftated hours of labour. Cot- 
tagers, however, are preferred for harveft work, as they do 
not require lodging, which it would be diflicult to find for 
fo many as are wanted at that feafon. When a cottager is 
employed through the whole year, which is done in a fe\r 
inftances, he is allowed a hou^e and yard, wit!i about L. 6 of 
wages. Some eat in the farmer's houfe ; and other?, are al- 
lowed, in name of maintenance, 61 bolls, or 52 fl-ones of oat- 
meal, with pafture for a cow; but, in the latter cafe, the wa- 
ges fddom exceed L 5, or L. 5 : 10 : o at mcft. By the 
wages he receives, witlh the produce of his wife's induftry, 
arifing chiefly from fpinning, he is enabled to live pretty 
comfortably, to bring up three or four children, and to give 
them an education fuitable to their ftation. It is evident, 
indeed, that doing this with an income of about L. 10 
mufl. require good economy ; but, unlefs it be wanting, there 
are no cottngers in ftraitened circumftaiices. Their ordinary 
food confifts of meal, partly of oats, partly of barley, potatoes, 
and milk. A family of fev/ perfons, viz. a wife and four

There remains about L. 3 : 1 5 : o, which is generally found 
adequate to all the other neceflaries of luch a family. 

Population. — From comparing the prefent number of inha- 
bited houfes and of baptifms, with thofe of any particular 
period of the prefent century, it does not appear that the pa- 
rifli has fufFered any material alteration in population. If 
there be any difference at all, it feems rather to have increa- 
fed in a fmall degree. Ihe prefent amount of its population 
is 2yi i of thefe 136 are females, and 155 males; among 
whom are 46 married or widowers, and 26 marriageaole 
batchelors. There are 46 fouls under 10 years of age, 7^ 
from 10 to 20, 114 from 20 to 50, 51 from 50 to 70 ; and 
)5 from 70 to 100. The annual average of births, for 50 
years backwards, is about 9, being in proportion to the whole 
population as i to 32, of marriages 3, and of deaths 4. A 
farmer's family, at an 'average, confifts of 10 perfons. Thert; 
are in the parifh 13 weavers, i carpenter, i blackfmith, i 
flioemaker, and 4 apprentices. 1 he number of fervants in 
the parilh is 68 ; of people born in other parifhes there arc 
176 ; and it is remarkable that there is but i farmer, and a 
very few other houfeholders, who were born and now refidc 
in the parifh. The number of children for each marriage is, 
at an average, about 4. AH the inhabitants, except one fe- 
male fervant, who has only a temporary refidence in the pa-j 
rifh, are of the eftablilhed church. 

Church. — The value of the minlfler's living, including the 
glebe, at a moderate converfion of what is paid in vidual, is 
about 88 guineas. The patronage of the parifli belonged to 

the

the Earl of Panmure, and fell to the crown by forfeiture in 
1715 ; but the reprefentative of that family is ftill titular of 
the teinds. From that period, to 1781, the right of prefent- 
ing to the church lay dormant, government being either ig- 
norant of the forfeiture, or not careful enough to claim the 
patronage. The prefent incumbent, who is married, was ad- 
mitted minifter of Lunan in April 1790. Mr Walter Mill, 
or, as he is called by feme hiliorians. Sir Walter Mill, a Po- 
pifii prieft, held the office of paflor of Lunan 20 years j but, 
afterwards embracing the doctrines of the Reformed, he was 
forced to abandon his charge. He was apprehended in the 
town of Dyfart by order of Cardinal Beaton, carried to St 
Andrew's, t/iedj condemned, and burnt, at the age of 82, in 
April 1558. One of the minifters, Mr Alexander Pedie, 
who died in I7I3 bequeathed fome plate for the Lord's 
Supper in the church of Lunan, on this Angular condition, 
that any Epifcopal congregation within feven miles of Lunarv 
requiring them fhould have the ufe of them for that purpofe. 
There is a marble monument erefted in the church to his 
memory, for upholding which his widow bequeathed an an- 
nuity of L. 4 Scotch, payable to the kirk-feflion. The church 
Ss an old edifice, repaired in 1773. The manfe and offices 
were built in J 783, and ftand nearly a mile north of the 
church. 

Poor, — The poor in the parilh of Lunan have been always 
Veil fuppiied. They have never been numerous, which has 
©ccafioned the funds to be uncommonly large. Befides the 
weekly collections, there is a capital of L. 500, for the main- 
tenance of the poor, and other purpofes to which parifli 
funds arc uf ally applied. The number on the poor's roll 
has been generally from four to fix ; but, from 1783 to 1790* 
there were eight 5 and confeejuentlv, during that period, the 



of Lxman, 447 

diiburfements of the feffion were much about equal to the 
whole income. The dearth, at the commencement of that 
periodj was certainly the caufe of the additional number j for 
they are again reduced to fix, who receive from 3 s. to 4 s. 6 d. 
a month, with a fmall fum annually for purchaling fuel. As 
no heritor, nor any perfon of fuperior rank, relidcis in the 
parifli, and the congregation is fmall, the wee-kly coUeiTtions, 
which are only from one to two fliillings, would not be near, 
ly adequate to the wants of the poor, were it not fcr the an- 
nual rent arifing from tho accumulated l\ock. The origin 
of this capital appears to have been legacies left long ago tor 
the behoof of the poor. 

Zchool. — David Jamefon, formerly a farmer in the parifli, 
left 2000 merks Scots, half of the interell: of which was for 
the poor, and the other half was made payable to the fchool- 
mafter for teaching fix poor fcholars. Till lately, this was 
all the fchoolmarter enjoyed \ but, by decreet of the conv 
miflioners of fupply, the heritors are now burdened with the 
payment of 200 merks Scots of yearly fiiiary* This, with 
the lalary, and ufual emoluments belonging to the offices of 
fefHon-clerk and precentor, and fees for teaching from 30 to 
40 fcholars, makes a living of about L. 25 Sterling. 

Mifiella/ieous Obfervations. — Ihe Englifh, or that dialeiR: of 
it peculiar to North Britain, is the only language uled or 
known by the inhabitants of Lunan. Many places in the pa- 
rifh, it is probable, owe their names to their being fititatcd in 
the neighbourhood of Redcaftle, now a ruin, in the parifh 
of Inverkeillor, and foimcrly a royal refidence. Hence 
Courthill, where the courts of juftice had been held ; Hawk* 
hill, where the King's faulconer had refided ; a.,d Cothill, 
where the fliepherd, it is likely, had his habitation and cots 

for

for his flock. The names of fome places are evidently deri» 

Ved from fhe Gaelic, as the name of the parifh, and Duiibart- 
net (calied aifo Drumbartnet)from Dun a hill, which is fo na- 
med from being fituated on an eminence. There is a falmoii 
fifhery at the mouth of the river, but it has been very un- 
productive for feveral years part, yielding nothing but troutj 
^ith wnich the river formerly abounded. They are now^ 
much deftroyed by the fteeping of flax, large quantities of 
^hich have of late years been raifed in the diftrift. It is not 
improbable but this operates alfo as a caufe of the falmoa 
having deferred the bay, where they were fometimes caught 
in great plenty. The fifhery is annexed to the farrh of Lu- 
nan, and no particular rent fpecified for it. Bcfides the hz- 
ted rent, tenants, in fome inftances, are bound to give their 
landlords, in the fuminer, one draught of their carts j their 
fervants a day in the hay-harvefl ; and their reapers a day irt 
autumn. The difHculry of getting people to hire at a time 
tvhen all ai-e bufy, is the reafon affigned for continuing to 
exa£l the two laft. Tenants require like fervices of their 
fubtenants ; but they are always limited to a certain number 
of days, and feldom exceed three or four yearly. Tenants in 
general complain more of being obliged to grind their corn 
at fome particular mill, and pay high ftipulated multures, a 
cuftom which prevails almoft univerfally in North Britain, 
than of thefe trivial fervices, which are feldom exafted fo ri- 
goroufly as to make them dillrefEng. '1 he fuel commonly 
ufed in fummer is turf, or broom, valued from i s. to 2 s. a 
cart load, of which there is plenty in the parifli ; and, in 
Winter, coals, 70 flone of which, called a boll, coft 6 s. at 
Arbroath, where no duty is exafted.

NUMBER XL VII. 
PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3629442">AUCHTERDERRAN</name>* 

By the Rev. iJfr.ANDREW Murray.</head> 

<p>

Name^ Situation, Extent, Soil, and Surface. 

THE name of the parifli, as well as many places in it, is 
faid to be derived from the Gaelic. This parifh is fi- 
tuated in the county of Fife, prefbytery of Kirkcaldy, and fy- 
nod of Fife. It is of an irregular form, about 4 miles long, 
and 3 broad. It is bounded by Auchtertool on the fouth, 
Abotfhal on the fouth-eaft, Dyfart on the eafl: and north, 
Kinglaflie and Portmeak on the north, and Ballingry on the 
weft. A great part, if not the whole, of the iklds are upon 
coal. "Where the ftratum conne£led with the coal comes near 
the furface, the ground is barren ; and, even where this is not 
the cafe, it is not remarkably fertile. It is moill throughout. 
Part of the i'oil is clay, and part black earth. The valley in 
which this parifh lies is bounded on the fouth and eail: by a 
ridge of ground, and on the weft by a fimilar ridge. Though 
the height of the ground exchides the view of the Firth of 
Forth, yet the higheft part of it, which can fcarccly be called 
a hill, is under tillage. There are many little inequalities in 
the fields, io that they appear rather broken and disjointed. 
The fame is the cafe with a great part of Fife. There are 
fbme rocks of a Angular appearance. What fti ikes the eye

moft is a number of detached pillars ftanding perpendicular- 
ly on the ba^"e of the rock, and feparated both at the iides 
and behind from the general mafs They are of a regular 
figure, refembling the trunk of a large tree. The riling 
grounds are all green, but rather of a dull?;y tinge, as if 
the plant did not delight in its fituation. 

Agriculture^ is'c. — About a fifth of the ground in the parifh is 
.employed in raifing corn, root^, &amp;c. There is very little wheat. 
Oats, barley, and peafe, are the common grains. Green crops 
of p tatoes, turnips, and cabbages, are introduced ; but, ex- 
cept potatoes, they are not in any great quantity The fowing 
of oats is begun about the ift of March, and finifhed about 
the 20th of April. The fowing of barley is begun about the 
20th of April, and finiflied about the 20th of May. The 
harveft, in a good lealon, begins about the ift of September, 
and ends about the middle of GiHiober. in a bad lealon, it 
continues till the beginning of November. The pafture, in- 
cluding fown grafs, comprehends 4-tifths of the parifh. 
There are 5 1 ploughs, 1 7 of which are drawn by horfes 
only J and black cattle are ufed in the reft. Small's new 
plough is introduced here. There is generally a cart to eve- 
ry plough, and about 18 more employed in leading coal, &amp;c. 
They are all two-horfe carts. The beft arable ground taken 
through a whole farm does not exceed 20 s. an acre when 
incloled ; and the fame farm will let for as much on the fame 
leale when in grafs and pafture. The poorer farms are let at 8 
or 10 s. an acre when incloled. The rent of one-half of the 
farms is from L. 10 to L. 20. There are fix whofe rent at pre- 
fent is about L, 30 each, which, at the expiration of the old 
leafe, will let at L. 100. Only five are let at L.ioo atprefent. 
The land-rent of the parifh is abo'.it L. 2000 Sterling j&amp;^r an- 
num. The nunaber of farms rather dimmilhes, which is 

partly

partly owing to life-rents and feus. They are, in general, in- 
clofed ; and the ground is fo much more fuited to grafs than 
corn, that the moft of the remainder of the arable land will 
be foon converted into grafs. The people and proprietors 
are fufficiently convinced of the benefits ot inclofing. fnclo- 
fing has banilhed fheep from the neighbourhood ; for (heep 
cannot be confined within the fame inclofures as blaclc cattle. 
On one large farm there are rows ot hedges and ftrips of plant- 
ing throughout, which is a complete fence ; and this mode of 
inclofing adds to the beauty of the country ; and the plantations 
thrive. But the cheapell, the moft valuable, the motl Ipeedi- 
ly railed, the moft lafting, and moft general fence, is the 
Galloway dike. The ftones are either found on the lurface, 
or got from quarries in the neighbourhood. A field of i o 
acres may be inclofed for L. 20 ; and the money is generally 
repaid in additional rent in 4 years. Fallow is not fo ge- 
neral as in a more advanced ftate of hufbandry. Of late, the 
arable lands are fcarcely ever left in grafs without lowing ar- 
tificial gralTes in them- The farmers pay their rents chiefly 
by raifing and feeding • a great number of black cattle, by 
which the circumjacent markets of Dunfermline, Kmguo-n, 
Dyfart, &amp;c. are I'uppiied. Agriculture has advanced greatly 
within thefe few years ; and the face of the country begins 
to change rapidly. The rile of rents has contributed to the 
progrefs of agriculture, by promoting additional induftry, and 
calling forth exertion. Ihe rents are all paid m money, ex- 
cept a few poultry to the proprietors, and 50 bolls of grain 
to the minifter. Winter provender is fcarce and dear, owing 
to the number of cattle ; but the farmers are beginning to 
provide ftacks of hay from their fown fields, which will prove 
the beft remedy for the evil. Good hay, at an average, fells 
from 34- d. to 4d. a ftone. The parifli does more than fup- 
ply itfelf with provifions. It exports particularly Iive-cattle 

butter, 



45* Statiftkal Account 

butter, cheefe, and poultry. It imports rather more wheat 
bread than could be made of the wheu that grows in it. Ic 
raifes oats nearly equal to the confumption of oat-meal. No re- 
markable hard(liip was fiiffered here from the leaion of 1782, 
although the harveft did not yield above 4 months provi- 
fions. The late Baron Stewart MoncriefF remitted rents to 
his tenants. The patron of the parifh, with a well timed be-; 
nevolence, diredled the grain of the vacant ftipend to be 
Ibid at a cheap rate among the poor. The corn is ground 
by water-mills ; but the rude cuftom of thirlage ftill remains 
on fome cftates. Landed property m Frfe chatiges n:ore than 
in any other county in North Britain ; and the land fold of 
late in this neighbourhood has generally been about 35 years 
purchafe- Leafes of farms are in general for 19 years. 

Reads. — The roads hitherto made were done by ftatute-la- 
bour, but are very indifferent. The ftatute-labour is of late 
partly commuted ; and turnpike roads are making. Cne of 
them is to pafs through this parifli, leaving the great road 
between Kirkcaldy and Cupar of Fife at the inn called the 
P/aiJlerers. It takes a weftern direction, through the pariflies 
of Leflie, Kinglaffie, and Auchterderran, and lands the paf- 
fengers on the Queensferry road at the kirk of Beathe. 
This line of road is already in ul'e in the fummer months ; 
but a free communication through this inland diftricl would 
be highly advantageous. The general opinion of the com- 
mon people is not againft turnpikes. This parifh has hi- 
therto been diftinguiflied for bad roads, and is inacceffible on 
the north for 6 months in the year. Hence the farmers on 
the oppofite fide muft: fell their commodities at an under 
rate, being fliut out from the coaft towns. 

Populailon. — The niimbet of inhabitants, according to Dr 
Webfter's ftate, is 1 194 ; at preletit they are j200.

Poor. — There are no poor belonging to this parifli that are 
vagrant. The poor are I'upplied in their u(ual refidences. 
Pride prevents our poor common people from making them- 
feivcs burdeidbme to the public, which in general they 
never do but from necellity. The number of poor in the 
monthly lift at prefent is 22- fhere are about L. 600 left 
in legacies, Sec. in the management of the felTion ; the in- 
tereft of which, with the coUedtions, .'s applied to the lup- 
port of the poor i heir llruation is much better than that 
of the poor in many of the neighbouring pariflies. 1 he kirk- 
feffion give their fervices gratis, (as every where in Scotland), 
and are from their llruation well qualified for pointing out 
the p' oper objects of charity. The weekly contributions for 
the poor does not exceed 2 s.

The preceding ftatement is favourable for earnings, from 
♦he number of children, which is rather Imall ; and particu- 
larly on account of the ages of the children, as at that pe- 
riod of their lives it is luppoftd in the calculation that the 
woman has it in her power to work half work at fpinning, and 
yet take care of her houfe and children. The day labourer 
of this diftrift, and his family, are more decently clothed 
than a family of the fame defcription in England, and there- 
fore it is fomewhat more particularly flated than in the i rint- 
ed Extradt accompanying the Queries. The fuel is alfo higher 
charged. They are obliged to ufe coals, a much finer fuel than 
that mentioned in the Extraft, and, at the loweft, it amounts 
to the expence above mentioned ; but 't ferves them for 
light, as well as heat, in the winter feafon. The greatefl: e 
vils of their fituation arife from the lovvnels of their diet, and 
the wretchednefs of their lodging, which is cold, dark, and 
dirty ; expofing them to a numf^rous clafs of diieales incident 
to fuch a condition. The meagre food of the labourmg man, 
too, is unequal to oppofe the effedls of inccffant hard labour 
upon his conftitution, and, by this eans, his frame is often 
^orn down before the time of Nature's appointment. 



That

That people continue to enter voluntarily upon fiich a hard 
fitnation, (hows how far the union of the fexes, and the love 
of independence, are principles of human nature; anu. from 
fuch caufes, this fuuation is not thought, by the people 'hem- 
feh'es, to be wretched, nor without lome lhare of comfort. 
"Within thele lafl: twelve years, the wages of a man have rifen 
from 8d. to I s. without a proport onal life upon his ex- 
pence. Wlwn this clafs, of people have got fuch additional 
wages as Will enable them to have better lodgmg, and to have

and the climate require, they w:ll then have nearly their 
fhare of human enjoyment. About the year 1755, the yearly 
■wage- of a domeftic man (ervant was L. 28 Scots, of a wo- 
man ftrvant L. 16 Scots. The wages of fervants, when 
maintairieti by the employer, in different branches of huf- 
bapfii-y, IS now L. 3, iterlmg a year for a woman, and L 6 a 
year for a man The w .oes of domcftic fervants is the fame. 
Wt'r)^ people :'re rather icarce, owing to the drain of wars, 
and the increalhig inJuitry of the country. 

Generai Characier of the People — The inhabitants are very 
regular in their attendance on public worfhip Formerly 
thi.y were fond of long church fervices, and confiuered it as a 
point of duty to continue long m religious exerciles Perhaps 
the Icrvices, thoutrh fliorter than before, are ftill too long for 
anfwering the ends of devotion and fpir tual edification. 1 he 
people are not illiterate. In common with the reft of Scotland, 
the vulg.-.r are, for their ftation, literate, perhaps, beyond all 
other nations. I'uritanic and abftrufe divinity come in for a 
fufficient lhare in their little ftock of books ; and it is per- 
haps peculiar to them, as a people, that thev endeavour to 
form opinions, by re.niing, as well as by frequent converfa- 
tion, on lo.me very met-aphyfical points connected with reli- 
gion, 



pf Auchierderran* 457 

gion, and pn the deeper doftrines of Chriftlanity. They 
likewife read, occafionally, a variety of other books uncon- 
nedled with fuch fubjefts. The parochial fchools are by no 
means fupplied with fuch enlightened teachers as thofe that 
were formerly inftrumental in difFufing this knowledge. No 
one of good education and ability now accepts of this redu- 
ced pittance, where the fituation is not favourable for procu- 
ring lucrative fcholars : And the village teacher, brought in 
by the fubfcription of needy people, is a ftlU more unquali- 
fied perfon. In fuch cafes, the people do not propofe feek- 
ing out the beft, but the cheapeft. The confequence will be, 
that the poorer diftrifts of the country, and the poor clafles of 
the people, muft become more ignorant. Although the pa- 
rilh confifts wholly of the poorer ranks of fociety, newfpapers 
are very generally read and attended to : The defire for them 
iiicreafes; and the reading of them feems to be attended with 
advantage. With regard to the intelle£lual character of the 
people : They are deficient in imagination, vivacity, humour, 
*fec. ; their apprehenfion and judgment are very good, and 
they make a decent figure in the common profeffions of 
life. With refpeft to their moral and religious chara6ler, 
they have all a profeflion of religion; but, in the points 
where their fituation more immediately leads to temptation, 
they too frequently and even habitually contradidl their 
profeflion. Their civil charadler is excellent : They leenx 
in fome degree capable of reflecting on the advantages 
of government ; and they obey it peaceably, and on prin- 
ciple. They could, however, be eafily ftirred up to fe- 
dition in matters of religion. There is one Burgher meet- 
ing in this parifli. The religious toleration granted feems 
to anfwer, in this diftri£l, the full ends of good govern- 
ment and public utility : It could hardly ftand on a bet- 
ter footing. Seceffion now begins to diminifii; and the

bitternefs of contending fe£ls is greatly fubfiding : This 
partly proceeds from the novelty being over ; partly from the 
great variety of fe£ls which have taken place ; and partly, it 
is hoped, from more enlightened views of trne religion. As 
to holidays for recreation or merry-making, the peopla have 
only one in the year, called Handfel-Monday ; and even the 
manner in which this is employed fhews the fober minded- 
nefs of the people. Inftead of meeting in large aflemblies for 
diverfions, each family coUefts its own kindred from the dif- 
ferent parts of the diftri£t, provides a feaft, and fpends the 
time in eating, drinking, and converfation. The holidays, 
befides Sabbaths, for religious fervices, in the Eftablilhment, 
are three days in the year ; among the Seceders fix. The 
people have fcarcely any fports after they are grown up. 
Among the infinite advantages of the Reformation, this feems 
to have been one difadvantage attending it, that, owing to 
the gloomy rigour of fome of the leading adlors, mirth, 
fport, and chearfulnefs, were decried among a people already 
by nature rather phlegmatic. Since that, mirth and vice 
have, in their apprehenfion, been confounded together. Some 
of the feftaries punifli attendance on penny weddings, and 
public dancing, with a reproof from the pulpit, in the pre- 
fence of the congregation : So that the people muft either 
dance by themfelves, or let it alone. This cenfnre, in feve- 
ral congregations, is falling into difufe. There are a few per- 
fons, called tinkers and homers^ half-refident, and half-itine- 
rant, who are feared and fufpe£tcd by the community. Two 
of them were banifhed within thefe fix years. Strangers 
complain of the pronunciation in this diftrifi: being drawling, 
and that it imprefles them with a belief that the perfon Ipeak- 
jng is four and ill tempered. The inhabitants are improving 
in their mode of living and drefs. Intemperance from fpiri- 
tous liquors is by no means frequent among them j but, un- 
luckily.

lackily, the ufe of whilky is increafing, and that of beer di- 
miniftiing. The blue bonnet, a national badge, is difappear- 
ing rapidly. The prevalent colour of the mens drefs is blue. 

Churchy Schooly ^c. — For feven years paft the ftipend 
has, at an average, been L. loo, including the glebe, which 
is large, befide the houfe and garden. Claud Bofwell, Efq; 
of Balmuto, is patron. A new manfe was built in 1784, 
and a new church in 1789. The income of the fchoolmafter 
may be about L. 10, independent of the fcholars fees, which 
are from is. 3 d. to 2 s. a quarter ; the number of fcholars 
from 50 to 60. There are, befides, two private fchools : The 
fcholars at both, taken together, may amount to 80. 

Mtfcellatteous Obfervations. — The air is moifi:, but not un- 
healthy : Fogs are not frequent, nor of nearly fo long conti- 
nuance as in the fouthern parts of the ifland. There is a mi- 
neral well at the bottom of the rocks formerly mentioned, 
recorded in Camden's Britannia, and Gordon's Itinerarium, 
for its medicinal qualities ; but it has not been rcforted to for 
fome time paft. The lake called Lochgellie is 3 miles in cir- 
cumference ; that called Camilla about 2 miles. There is acom- 
. ,.on free-ftone quarry for houfe-building, &amp;c. There is peat 
in the parifh, but it is little ufed for fuel. Coal is to be dug 
in every corner of the parifli, and fcarcely exceeds a farthing a 
ftone at the pit mouth. There is likewife great abundance of 
lime-ftone, which, when burnt and flaked, fells at 7d. a boll. 
The ufe of it in agriculture is increafing \ but not fo much here 
as in other places where the price is perhaps double or triple, 
'tiduftry is increafing ; and there are very convenient fituations 
■,n which manufadtures might be eftablifhed. Several wca- 
ers living at Lochgellie, and neighbourhood, connect them- 
*,lves with the manufadures of Kirkcaldy. There is a thri- 
ving

ving bleachfield here. The inhabitants have no predilc^Hort 
either for the army or the navy; but more of rhem go to the 
latter. They enjoy, in a tolerable degree, the comforts and 
advantages of fociety. The mufic here is between the quiclc 
fprightly mufic of the north, and the flow plaintive mufic of

There are 6 alehoufes, or inns, chiefly fupported by the 
tryftes at Lochgellie, i. e, fairs or markets where \.o cuftoms 
are exafled on the commodities fold ; the chief of which is 
black cattle. The number of Lochgellie tryftes is 5 in the 
year. 

A collier earns, or can earn, about 10 s. a week. The coal- 
works juft now working in this parifli draw fOr coals L. 1700 
a year ; L. 500 of which is for coal exported, the reft for the 
confumption of the neighbourhood. Private families here 
never brew their own beer ; but private baking is ftill in ufe. 
There are but 2 public bake-houfes in the parifh. 

The advantages and difadvantages of employing unmarried 
hired fervants, or married cottagers, are, to the immediate 
employers, pretty nearly balanced : A mixture of each, where 
the farm is large, is m.oft convenient. The preference be- 
ginning to be fliewn for married cottagers is far more bene- 
ficial in its confequences. The beft iervants for hufbandry 
are raifed from thefe cottagers families ; otherwife they be- 
come fcarce, dear, and unfliilful.

which, of late, have been falling oflf. It has been doubted 
whether our law authorifing pigeon-houfes is not, in fome 
degree, contrary to natural equity ; as it does not feem rea- 
fonable that any one ftiould keep a houfe furniflied with a 
multitude of animals, over which he has no government, and 
which prey on his neighbour's corn as freely as on his 
own, while he alone has the profit. It has alfo been doubted, 
whether, on the whole, pigeons are not detrimental to the 
public, by devouring more corn than the profit of them is 
worth ; it having been ftated as a fa£l:, that a pigeon-houfe of 
an ordinary Cze, moderately ftocked, will confume 200 quar- 
ters of feed in a year. 

As an inftance of remarkable induftry, it may be mention- 
ed, that a young man of this parifh went into the nortbjof 
England as a labourer, and laid by, out of his earnings, in. the 
courle of fomewhac more thaii i-.- , ';ars, L. 400 Sterling. He 
then returned to his native parilh, purchafed and furniflied a 
pretty extenfive feu, upon which he has lived with his'familj^ 
28 years. . ' "

Namey Situation^ Extent^ Soil, l2fc. 

THE antient and modern name of this parlfh is Kinlofs, 
derived from Kain, a Head, and Loch ; i. e. the Head 
of the Loch ; Kinlofs being fituated on the head of the Bay 
of Findhorn. This parifh is in the (hire of Elgin and Forres ; 
in the prefbytery of Forres, and fynod of Moray. It is of a 
fquare form, being between three and four miles long and 
broad. It is bounded on the eaft by the parifh of Alves ; on 
the fouth and fouth-weft by RafFord and Forres ; and on the 
north by the Moray Firth. It is a very flat level country. 
The foil is various ; in fome places light and fandy ; in others 
a rich and deep clay, mofs, and loam, make up a confiderable 
part of the foil ; and all of it, when well managed, produces 
good crops of grain of every kind. This parifh, being flat, 
is but poorly fupplied with good water ; and mofl of the 
fprings tafte of minerals. The fhore is flat and fandy. The 
fifh caught here are moflly haddocks and whittings, and, in 
the feafon, cod, fkate, and ling, which are all fold in the 
country, and at Forres, at about i d, or li d. a pound.

tlimaie and Dijlempers. — ^The air is (harp, dry, and heal- 
thy. The moft prevalent diftempers are cutaneous difeafes, 
fcurvy, and rheumatifm j owing, perhaps, to hard labour, 
the fharpncfs of the air, a fpare or fifh diet, and want of 
cleanlinefs. 

Population — The amount of the inhabitants of this parlfh 
is 234 families, which contain 103 1 perfons, being nearly 4^ 
to each family. There are 4 heritors, 40 farmers, 56 fifher- 
men and lailors, 9 fhoemakers, 6 weavers, 6 carpenters and 
Wrights, 2 taylors, 2 fmiths, 2 millers, 2 mafons, 2 coopers, 
I merchant, i brewer, i thread manufadlurer, 10 day labour- 
ers, and 6 traveling beggars. Dr Webfter's ftate of the in- 
habitants is 1 191. The annual average of births from 1700 
to 1720, is 25 males and 21 females; from the beginning 
of the year 1779 to the beginning of 1789, is 29. la this 
lafl: period were born 147 males, and 145 females. The 
decreafe of population is owing to the fpirit of traveling, 
and the engroffing of farms. 

Church and Stipend. — The manfe was built in 1751; the 
church in 1765. The value of the living is uncertain} a 
procefs of augmentation having been carried on fince the year 
1 78 1. The patrons are Lord Mora^ and Mifs Brodie of 
Lethen. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — ^There are no rivers in this pa- 
rifh but the Findhorn, which runs fouth and weft, and falls 
into the Moray Firth at the town of Findhorn. This river 
abounds with falmon, which, in the fpring, and beginning of 
fummer, are boiled at Findhorn, and kitted and fent to the 
London market. Frefh falmon is fold here at 4 d. a pound.

Situation. Extent, ^c. 

THE antlent name of this'parifti feems to have bfeen 
Finhaven. It is lituated in the county of Angus prcf- 
bytery of Forfar, and fynod of Angus and Mearns. Ii is 5 
miles long, and about 2 broad. It is bounded by the- parifh 
of Tannadie on the north ; Aberletnno and Rcfcobie on the 
fouth ; Carraldftone on the eaft; and Kirriemuir on the weft. 
The general appearance of the countiy is flat. The air is 
naoift. 

Hills. — The hill of Finhaven lies on the fouth fide of the 
parifti, in a direttioq from eaft to welt, tor the fpace of 10 
miles. On the top of this hill are the remai.is of an old caftle : 
The foundation of the whole of it is yet vifible. Its dimen- 
fions are 137 yards in length, and 37 in breadth, nearly m the 
form of z parallelogram. The foundation feems to have been 
built without mortar. The ruins difcuver (bmettiing like vi- 
triable ftones, and plainly appear to have undergone the a£lion 
of fire It is faid that the family of Finhaven were wont to 
retire to this caftte in times of danger. There are - vident

the foot of it, immediately iouth of the cafllc, there is ati ap- 
pearance of a crater of a volcano, and all around fomething 
that refembles lava. 

Rivers. — The river Elk runs through the parifh j and, it 
is thought, might eafily be made navigable fmm the Kirlc- 
town of Tannadice to Montrofe, about 12 miles diftant. In 
its prefent ftate, it runs in a Terpentine tlireftion through a 
very fertile country. Formerly it abounded with falnion ; 
but, on account of the number of crubs, there are now few 
or none. The rivulet called Lemno has lately been turned 
into a canal, which runs the whole lentth of the parilh, from 
ca^ to weft, and bifedts it. It might eafily be made navigable 
for fmall boats. It joins the river Efk below the old caftle 
of Finhaven.

Origin of the Name. 
TT has long been a general report, and the prevailing tra- 
dition in this country, that, fomc time before the year 
1004, in which the church of Gamrie is faid to have been 
built, (and there is at this day the date 1004 on the fteepie), 
that the Thane of Buchan purlued the Danes to the precipice 
or brow of the hill above the church, and there defeated them 
with great flaughter. Several of their fki.lls (moft likely of 
their chiefs who had fallen in battle) were built into th« 
church wall, where they remain entire : From hence it came 
to be called by foine the Kirk of Sculls. In the Gaelic lan- 
guage, the word Kemri^ from which, probably, Gamrie is de- 
rived, Ggnldes rufPiing J}ep, or running leap. And this deri- 
vation Teems a natural one ; becaufe, from the firuation of 
the hill, which is one of the higheft on this part of the coaft, 
and very fteep on one fiJe, it muft have been a running fkir- 
niilh, and very fatal to the vanquilTied In fome old regi^. 
ters, the name of the parifh is written Ghaemrie. On the 
faid eminence, above the kirk of Gamrie, at the eaft end of 
one of the molt level and extenfive plains in Buchan, arc a 
number of veftiges of ercampraents, which at this day are 
galled by the name of bloody pots, or bloody pits.

headlands, called Gamrie and i roup, Up.^d, , which projcdl a 
conliderable way into the Tea, a beautiful bay is formed, where 
there is fine anchoring ground, and veffels can ride m fatety. 
At high water, a perfon could fling a fl-one into the fea from 
the church ; and looking out of it, 'it has the appearance, to 
a ilranger, as if the fea wafhed its. foundations. The church 
is built, after the manner of lome very old edificesf, witJi un- 
flacked lime, and with very thick walls; and, although it has 
alre.idy Rood upwards of 706 y -ar.s, it may, \i the roof be 
kept in proper repair, laft for hundreds ot years to come. 
The north hde of oamne parifh is bounded by that part of 
the German Ocean called the Moray Firth ; on the eaft by 
the parifh of Aberdour ; on the Ibuth by the parifhts of 
Monwhiter and King Edward ; and on the weft by the river 
Dovern, which I'eparates the parilh of Gamrie from Banff. 
This parilh Itretchs's g\ miles along the fea-coaft, which is a 
very bold one It is almoft a continued chain of ftupendous 
rocks, in many places perpendicular, and 200 yards above 
the fea It is between 3 and 4 miks broad. Gamrie parifh 
lies in the county of Banff, prefbytery of Turriff, and fynod 
of Aberdeen. The foil, in many places, is very fertile, and 
in others as barren ; arid, though much has been done of late 
years, there is ftill great Icope for improvement. The hilly 
ground is in general covered with heath, and in fome places 
with a coarfe kind of grafs, on which fheep and young cattle 
are fed. Sheep, indeed, are very much banifhed from the 
parifh. When Mr Wilfon firff came to the parifh, there 
was fcrirrely a farmer who h id not a flock ; but now there 
are only two or three that have any at all. This is in a great

Zea Coajl, and Fijheries. — On tuis coaft a variety of ditfcrent 
kinus of hlh are caught, vrz.- hug, cod, haddocks, vi^iuings, 
turbot, {kc'te. &amp;c. with which this cour.try ufcd to be re- 
markably well luppHed, and a conliderable quantity of thetn, 
when dried, were carried to the t'ir(h of Forth, and fold there. 
From ttie bell: inforniation, ic appears that the tilhermcn in 
this paiilh have lometimes received for their fait hfli L. 2^9 
annually. Of bte years, the filliing ha= been lo reaiarkably 
poor, (to what caule it is perhaps diiEcult to fay, but molt 
likely one principal reafon is, the imaienie quantities of fea- 
dogs, a kind of ihark, with which this coall has been in- 
felted,, that there has hardly been fifti lulBcient to lupply 
the markets at home. Of conlequence, it is to be fuppoied 
they have rilen much in value. Long after the preltnt minif- 
ter was lettled in the parilh, h- could have purchaild haddocks 
at one penny and three half-pence a dozen, wh.ch now coft a 
fliiiung to eighteen pence ; and in proportion for other kinds 
of hlh, and every other article of food. Un this coaft, great 
quantities ui fea weed, called ware, ar^^ thrown up on the 
fhore, which the farmers lay on the ground, and find very- 
profitable in railin,; crops of barley. In this par lh, it is iaid 
on with a very fpanng hand, owing to the lleepnefs of 'he 
coaft, and the bad accels to the fhore. Confiderabk quan- 
tities' alio of this fea- weed are cut off from the rocks, 
for 'he purpole of araking kelp. At an average, about 3* 
tons are made annually, which fell from ij. 3 to L. 5

rilhes n! Banft' and Gamrie, is an ^-xceeding good lal-

and Spain. 

Mineral Springs, parries, — Near the fea-coaft, and 
in the neighbourhood ; f Macduff, is a pretty good mineral 
fpring, called the Well of Farlair, which has been ufeful in 
gr ivelliih complaints. Of late years it has come into confi- 
derable repute, and a number of people rcfort to it annually. 
In this parifh. upon the eftate of Melrofe, now the property 
of Lord Fife, is a very good flate-quarry. The quantity an- 
nu' ly madf has been various, depending on the demand, and 
the aumber of hands emoioyed. The flates are of a good 
qualify, of a beautiful blue coiour, not inferior to the Eafdale 
flare, only thicker, larger, ano roake a heavier roof Quar- 
riers are commonly paid ' v the piece, which is certainly the 
befl: way fr ■■ theti lelves and their employers. Comuion day- 
labourer^ i lually receive from 7 d. to 9 d. a day in winter, and 
from y d. to 1 s. in fummer. 

Naiura/ Curio/ities — Near the eaft end of the parifh, and not 
far from the houfe of Trcqp, are three great natural curiofi- 
ties. I. A perpendicular rock of very great extent, full of 
llielvcs, znd polTciired by thoufands of birds called Kitty- 
weaks. Thefe arrive in the beginning of fpring, and leave it 
again towards the end of Auguft, after they have brought 
forth their young. Some people are fond of eating the young 
Kitty's i but the {hooting of them is a favourite diverfion e- 
very year. The feafon for this is commonly the lafl: week 
of July. Whither thefe birds go in winter is not known ; .

and 40 broad, from which there is a fubterrancous paffage to 
the fea, about 80 yards long, through which the waves are 
driven with great violence in a northerly ftorm, and occafioa 
a fmbke to afcend from the den. Hence it has got the name 
of Hell's Lumb, i. e. Hell's Chimney. 3. Another fubter- 
raneous paflage, through a peninfula of about 150 yards 
long from fea to fea, through which a man can with difEculty 
creep. At the north end of this narrow paflage is a cave a- 
bout 29 feet high, 30 broad, and 150 long, containing not 
lefs than 90,000 cubic feet. The whole is fupported by im- 
menfe columns of rock, is exceedingly grand, and has a won« 
derfully fine effe£t, after a perfon has crept through the nar- 
row paflage. This place has got the name of the Needle's 
Eye. There are in the parifh feveral tumuli. Not many 
years 3go one of them, in the neighbourhood of Macduff, 
was opened j and there was found in it an urn, containing a 
confiderable number of fmall human bones. 



Population — The population of the parifli is nearly double 
fince the year 1732. At the above period the parifh con- 
tained 1600 fouls, and now nearly 3000. About the years 
1704 and 1705, it appears by the Regifters that the number 
of births annually, at an average, were then 45 ; and, for fe- 
veral years paft, they have not been unaer 6©. The number 
of deaths cannot be afcertained fo far back. About 30 years 
ago they were from 10 to 12, and for 7 years paft nearly 20 
annually. About 30 years ago there were from 12 to 14 
marriages annually, and, for 7 years paft, not lefs than 26. 

In this parifti, many inftances of longevity might be men- 
tioned. It is only a few years fince a fiflierman in Macduff 
died at the age of 109 ; and there are living at prefent fevo^al 
perfons 90 years old and upwards. Mr Wilfon is in his 97th

year ; and lad autumn, at the conclufion of the harveft, the 
age of him, and the two fervants that aflifted in taking in his 
crop, amounted in all to 257 ; and it is worthy remarking 
that on- of thefe has been his fervant 50 years. Mr Willbn 
"was the firft that introduced turnips and potatoes into the pa- 
rifh. He had a few of them in his garden, which the peo* 
pie in coming to the church ufed to look at as a great curio- 
fity ; .and it was thought, at that time, that none but a gar- 
dener could raife them. It was long before the method of 
hoeing came to be thought of. Bejng fown thick, and hand- 
weeded, they came to no lize. Another fingukrity deferves 
notice, viz. that, when he came to Gamrie, there was not a 
watch in church except the laird's and the minifter's. 

Church The minifter's living is, commttnibus annis, L. loO 

Sterling; the crown patron. The prefent incumbent was fet- 
tled in the year 1732. He has been a widower for ten year* 
paft; has had 14 children ; ten of whom (five fons and five 
daughters) he has lived to fee well fettled in the world. 

Poor. — 'In fuch a popular parifli, it is to be fappofed there 
will be feveral poor, and accordingly between 50 and 60 re- 
ceive charity out of the parifh funds ; and of thefe the year 
1782 added feveral to the lift. The weekly colIe£tion at 
Gamrie and Macduff is at an average 14 s. L. 450, which 
is at intereft, belongs to the poor of this parifli. 

RentaU — The valued rent of the parifh is L. 5489 : 6 : 8 
Scots. The prefent real rent, exclufive of fifheries, is nearly 
L. 1680 Sterling. 

Townsy Villages, and Mifcellaneous Ohfervations . — The prin- 
cipal caufes of the incrcafe of population are, the number of 

fiflaing 



of Oamr'ie. 475 

^filing towns on the coaft, the breaking of large farms into 
fmaller ones, the encouragement given by the heritors to im- 
prove wafte ground, and their endeavouring to introduce a 
better mode of culture. The principal town in the parifii is 
Macduff, the property of Lord Fife. In 1732 there were only 
a few fifhermen's houfes in Macduff, but now there are fc- 
veral well laid out ftreets, and 1000 fouls in the town. The 
harbour, on which his Lorddiip has already laid out up- 
wards of L. 5000, will, when finifhed, be one of the beft in 
the Moray Firth. There are ten veffels from 60 to 120 tons 
burden, and 6 filhing boats, belonging to Macduff. Three 
of them are in the London trade, two in the eaft country 
trade, and the others trade moft commonly to the Firth of 
Forth. 

Since the great increafe of population in this part of the 
parifli, his Lordihip has eredted a Chapel of Eafe in Macduff, 
for the accommodation of the inhabitants, who are nearly fix 
miles from their parilh church, and gives a falary to a quali- 
fied clergyman to preach and difpenfe the ordinances of reli- 
gion among them. 

On the eaft end of this parifli, there are very near to 
one another two other fmall towns, Gardenfton and Cro- 
vie, both the property of Lord Gardeiflon, and not far from 
his houfe at Troup, I'he town of Gardenfton contains 
nearly 300 fouls, and Crovie 100. In thefe two places are 
the fame number of veffels and fifhing-boats as in Macduff,

denfton are the only heritors. Lord Fife; does not refide in 
the parilh, but one of his principal feats (Duff-houfe) is very 
near it, being only about an Englifh mile from Macduff. His 
Lordfliip has paid the greateft attention to the improvement 
of his eftates, and the good of the country, by encouraging,

inclofing, binding his tenants to have yearly a certain quan- 
tity of their ground in turnip, fo much in fallow, and fo 
niuch laid down in grafs feeds. Thefe regulations were 
highly proper and necelTary I'ome years ngo, becaufe people 
are led in chains by habit ; and it is by flow degrees, ancl 
well digefted plans, they arc made to depart from eftablifhed 
cuftoms : But, now that the propriety of thefe regulations 
are feen, it would be difficult to rnake the farmers have fuch 
fmall quantities of turnip, &amp;c. as it was necelTary at firft to 
reftrid them to. Lord Fife has alfo converted the whole 
cuftoms and fervices (ufually called bonnage) at a mode- 
rate rate. This is of the utmoft importance to the te- 
nants. Not many years ago, many of them paid nearly one- 
half of their rent in fowls, eggs, fheep, &amp;c. delivered in kind, 
and the labour of thcmlelves, their fervants, horfes, in feed- 
time and harveft, carriage of peats, and jnany other works in 
the diiferent feafons throughout the year, when galled for ; by 
vvhich means they v,'ere often obliged to plough, dung, and 
harrow their landlord's ground, and lofe the feafon for their 
own. Planting is a mode of improvement in which no per- 
fon in this country has been more fuccefsful than the Earl of 
Fife. His Lordfliip has planted not lefs than from 7000 to 
Sooo acres on his different eftates, which he continues 
yearly to increafe ; and at this moment the whole is in a very 
thriving ftate. An account of the various kinds of trees, and 
the method taken to rear them, will be feen in Young's An- 
nals of Agriculture, and the Minutes of the Society of Arts 
and Commerce. The moft confiderable plantation in this pa- 
rifh is what is called the Tore of Troup. Ther« are upwards 
of 600 acres planted withrtfees of various kinds, in a thriving 
ftate. Thefe were reared chiefly by the direction of the late 
Mr Garden of Troup, and begun by his grandfather. Mr 
Garden, who is now fucceeded by his brother Lord Gardea- 

ftOBj 



of Gamrie. 



fton, was unanlmoiifly elected member of parliament for the 
county of Aberdeen, during three fucceeding feflions of par- 
liament j he conftantly refided at Troup, in this parifli, excep- 
ting the time he attended parliamentary bufinefs, and paid 
great attention to the improvement of his eftate, and the 
good of his country. He neVer gave a fliorter leafe than for 
a life ; and to feveral of his tenants he gave very long leafes, 
viz. a life, two nineteen years, and a life. He was not like 
many others, who, when they faw a tenant thriving, thought 
he had too good a bargain, and would demand a very high 
rent at the next letting. It was his joy to fee his tenants car- 
rying on their improvements, and profpering by their honeft 
indultry. Nor, w^hen any of his leafes fell vacant, was it ever 
known that he did not prefer the tenant's own Ion, and con- 
tinue him in the poffcllion, if he was difpofed to follow the 
fame occupation with his father. And it may be fafely faid, 
that, owing to the encouragement given by Lord Fife and Mr 
Garden, there are few tenants in the north of Scotland more 
thriving than in the parifli of Gamrie. In the year 1782, 
when many others were not able to pay their rents, fcarcity 
was not much felt except by the pooreft clafs. 

The language fpoken in this parifli is the Scottifh, with an 
accent peculiar to the north country. There is no Erfe. 

The fuel ufed in the parifli is partly coals and partly peats. 
The latter has of late years become very fcarce ; and coals 
are every day much more commonly ufed ; which, owing to 
a partial and oppreflive tax, coft very dear, and is a very- 
great hindrance to improvement in this part of the country. 
It is certainly very unfair, and highly abfurd, that this necef- 
fary article, which at any rate niufl: be confiderably higher in 
jprice to confumers in the North, from the expence of car- 

riage^

riage, than it 5s to thofe on the other fide of the Redhcac?,, 
Ihould alfo be loaded with a tax from which the fouthern in- 
habitants are exempted : And it is to be hoped the wildom and 
juftice of the legiflature will foon provide a remedy, either by 
a total repeal, or by making the tax payable at the pit, which 
would thereby become general, and be much lefs partially 
felt.

By the Rev. Mr David Kemp.</head> 

<p>

Name, Situation, is'c. 

GASK, the name which the parifli has had for time im- 
memorial, is Gaelic, and fignifies, it is faid, in that 
language, a Slope. As the parifh is fituated on arifing ground, 
the name is defcriptive of its fituation. Gaflc is in the coan- 
ty of Perth, prefbytery of Auchterarder, and fynod of Perth 
and Stirling ; is nearly a fquare, each fide of which is fome- 
xvhat more than two Englifh miles. The ground flopes on 
each fide of the Roman caufeway, which runs through the 
middle of 'the parifh upon the higheft ground; the fouth 
flope is a pleafant fertile bank, laid out into cultivated fields, 
and bounded by the river Earn, which bf unds the pariflx oa 
the fouth ; on the north flope are planti-tions of fir, oak, 
birch, &amp;c. interiperfed with corn-fields ?nd paftures. Calk 
is bounded on the fouth by Dunning, on the weft by Trinity 
Gaflc, on the north by Maderty and Methven, and on the 
eaft by Tippermuir and Forteviot, 

Population, — The population is much the fame as for half 
a century paft, but has rather increafed fince 1745. In 1790, 
there were in the parifli 486 individuals, of whom 141 were 

under 



4%p Statl/lical Auount 

under ten years of age ; and of the 345 above that age, 164 
were males, and 181 females. Of the total number, 335 be- 
longed to the eftablifhed church, 140 were feceders, and 1 1 
of the Epifcopal perfuafion. There are i ic inhabited houfes 
difperfed over the parifh, of which i is occupied by an he- 
ritor, 22 by farmers, 41 by carpenters, wrights, mafons, 
Ihoeniakers, and taylors, 1 2 by perpendiclers *, 13 by day- 
labourers, I ; by fingle women, 4 by married fervants, and 
the remaining 2 by the minifter and the fchotilmarter. The 
number of male fervants is 48, and of female fervants 40. 
There are, on an average, 10 baptifed, 6^burjed, and 5 couple 
married in a year. 

Stipend, Pooty i^fc. The living is L, 43 in money, 2 chal- 
ders of meal, i chalder of barley, and a glebe of 4! acres. 
The manfe was built in 1750 ; the kirk is old, but kept in 
good repair by the heritors. The king is patron. The ave- 
rage number of poor upon the funds for thefe 25 years is 6 j 
and the amount of coUedions and donations for their fup- 
port is L. 15 annually. 

Produce, l^c.—T\\t parifti produces wheat, barley, peafe, 
potatoes, turnips, fown and pafture grafs ; and fupphes itfelf 
•with all forts of grain, befide felling confiderable quantities to 
Perth, Crieff, &amp;c. There are pretty large beds of marl 
here. Free-ftone and grey flate abound, and are eafily quar- 
ried. 

Mifcellaneous Obfervations. — The air is dry and healthy. 
The Earn, which forms the fouthern boundary, is a confi- 
drable river, though not navigable, producing falraon, trout, 

and 

• Cottagers, who hold a fmall piece of ground of the tenant,

and pike. There are 131 horfes, 648 head of cattle, and 50 
flieep in the parifh ; of wild quadrupeds there are foxes, 
badgers, polecats, and rabbits ; of birds, partridges, wood- 
cocks, black-cocks, fnipes, &amp;:c. A mafon's wages are i s. 4 d. 
a Wright's 10 d. a taylor's 6 d. and a day-labourer's 6 d. a 
day, with vidluals. The fuel ufed here is coal and peat } the 
former cofts i i d. a /lone. The air is dry and healthy. 

Antiquities. — A Roman caufeway runs through the middle 
of the parifli, on the higheft ground ; it is 20 feet broad, com- 
pofed of rough ftones, clofely laid together, and points weft- 
ward to a camp, ftill diftinguiftiable, in the parifh of IMuthil, 
and eaftward to another, alio vilible, in the parifli of Scone. 
This caufeway is in entire prefervation, as the proprietor of 
the adjacent grounds, though he indofed the fields on each 
fide with ftone- dikes, did not fufFer a ftone to be taken from 
the road. Along the caufeway are ftations capable of con- 
taining J 2 or 20 men ; they are inclofed by ditches, yet very 
diftin£l,and feem to have been defigned for the accommodation 
of the overfeers of the work. Within Gafk's policy, in this pa- 
rifh, vefliges of two Roman camps, one on the fouth, and 
the other on the north of the caufeway, are ftill vifible ; and 
the ditches, with the Praetorium, are diftinct, though the 
ground is planted with fir. One of ihefe camps feems to 
have been capable of containing 500 men, and the other half 
that number.

UNITED PARISHES OF <name ref="NA">LISMORE
    AND APPIN</name>. 

By the Rev. Mr Donald M'Nicol.</head> 

<p>

Origin of the Name^ 

KILLMULUAG, and Ifland Mund, were the old names 
of thefe parKhes, and the only names by which they 
are deligned in the Teind records at Edinburgh. Killmuluag 
liteiaiiy fignifies the Cell or Chapel of St Muluag, a faint of 
the feventh century, who was the firft dignitary here, and 
probably laid the foundation ot the cathedral. IJlnnd Mund 
fignifies the Ifland of St Mungo, a fmall illand in Loch Leven 
in Glenco, dedicated to that faint. The ifland has been long 
the common cemetery, or burying place, of the inhabitants 
of Glenco. Lifmore, the modern name of this parifh, figni- 
fies large, cr exteniive gardens. Lis, or Lios, in the Celtic 
language, denotes a- garden. 

Extent. — The extent of this parifli will hardly be credited 
by an luhabitgnt ot the fouth of Scotland, being, from the 
louth-weft end of Lifmore to the extreme part of Ken- 
lochbeg, to the north-ealt in Appin, 63 miles long, by 10, 
and in fome places 16, broad. It is interfeiled by confi- 

derablc

.^eralilc arms of the fea, and comprehends the countries of 
Lifmore, Airdi, Straith of Appin, Uurror, Glencrcren, Gleii- 
co, and Kingerloch : The laft is 9 computed miles long, fi- 
tiiated in the north fide of Linneheloch, an arm of the fea 
•about 3 leagues over, which divides it from Lifmore. I his 
imited parifti is bounded by the feas that divide it from Ard- 
chattan and Killmore to the fouth and fouth-eaft ; by Glen- 
urchy or Clachandyfart on the eafl, at the King's floufe; by 
Killmalie on the north-eaft ; by Suineart, a part of the parifli 
of Ardnamurchan, on the north-weft, by Morvein on the 
weft ; and by the Ifland of Mull, and the great Weftern Ocean, 
on the weft and fouth-weft. 

Situation and Surface. — This parifli is fituated in the (hire 
and fynod of Argyle, and prefbytery of Lorn. In a parifh 
of this prodigious extent, the foil muft be various. The 
Hland of Lifmore, where tle minifter refides, is 10 miles 
long, and from a mile to a mile and a half, or two miles 
broad. It is founded totally on lime-ftone rock. The fur- 
face is moftly v£ry rugged and uneven, by the interfedion 
of the rocks. The foil is rich, confifting of black fofc 
loam, formed from the furface of the lime-ftone mouldered 
down, and produces much grain. The parifh of Appin is a 
happy mixture of foil, equally fuited to corn and grafs ; but 
by far the greateft part of this extenfive parilh is mountain- 
ous, and well adapted for fheep. There is very little grain 
raifed in Kingerloch, or even in the higher parts of Appin, 
fince fheep ftocks have been found beneficial. Many of 
the ftieep farms are very extenfive *, and, confidering the 
height of the hills, produce excellent grafs, and, of courfe, 
very good ftieep, perhaps among the beft in thefe « rCcira 

diftrias. 



Oae of them Is 18 Scots miles lonjg.

diftri£ls. There are few hills in the Highlands where the 
grafs grows higher up towards the tops than in thefe moun- 
tains. The very fummits of them all arc rocky. A very 
fmall proportion of the land in Kingerloch and Appin is now 
in tillage. 

Climate and D'lfenfes, — The climate here, lilce all the coun- 
tries expofed to the great Atlantic Ocean, is generally moift 
and damp ; the two laft years have been more remarkably 
nioift than any in the memory of this generation. A great 
deal of rain fails here, but there are feldom fuch floods, 
or heavy falls, as in the fouth, except a few thunder 
Ihowers in very warm fummers. There is feldom fuch 
deep fnow here, or of fuch long continuance, as in the 
fouth j nor is the froft generally fo intenfe, though arms of 
the fea have been known to freeze over. Few local pr epi- 
demical diftempers prevail here. The rheumatifm, the ge- 
neral complainr of all moiil: climates, is very common in thefe 
parts : It is rather matter of furprife that it is not more fre- 
quent, confidering the dampnefs of moft of the common peo- 
ple's houfes, and how much the inhabitants are expofed to 
rain and cold; efpccially as their ordinary mode of living is not 
very luxurious. Fevers and fluxes fometimes prevail among 
the country people ; and colds and coughs are very frequent 
in fevere winters and fprings. Agues are almoft unknown 
here. Within thefe two or three years, the jaundice is be- 
come very frequent in this and fome neighbouring pariflies. 
Many of the inhabitants live to a great age. During the re- 
fidence of the prefent incumbent, many inftances of longevity 
have appeared. Many live to the age of 84, and 85, fome to 
9c, 94, and 96, and even to 100 years. One man died laft 
year in Appin at the age of 105. In the year 1744, the pre- 
fent incumbent faw a woman in Appin who was allowed to

be 116. She then fat in a very ereft pofture, fpinning at a 
rock or diftafF, Innoculation is beginning to gain ground 
among the common people, though fame of them ftill retain 
violent prejudices againft it. The inhabitants are, on the 
whole, abundantly healthy, owing, probably, in part to their 
nor living pent up In towns or villages, or being more or left 
employed in fedentary occupations. They live moltly in 
houfes detached from each other; and are induftrious, chear- 
ful, and conftantly engaged in active employments in the 
open air, which greatly tends to the prefervation of their 
health. The conllant fea-breezes likewife prove very fa- 
vourable to their conftitutions. The inhabitants of Lifmore 
have univerfally the benefit of as fine frefli water fprings, if. 
fuing from lime-ftone rocks, as any country can boaft of. 
When they engage in fowing or reaping, they often work 
very keenly ; and, in rowing their fmall open boats, they of- 
ten over-exert themfelves, to the great detriment of their 
health. The military ardour of all Highlanders is a well 
known charaderiflic. 

Rivers. — The rivers Creren, Co, or Conn, (the Flngaliati 
Cona, a beautiful romantic river), the river of Coinich in 
Kingerloch, with thofe of Durror, Ba'lichelifh, Laroch, and 
Leven, are the moft confid-Table. Moft of thefe contain 
falmon, more or lels, and all of them yellow, or mofs and 
i'ea trout, in the proper feafons. None of the trouts are ever 
fold ; and few of the falmon are fold in the country ; when 
they are, they fetch 2d. and 3 d. a pound. There are feve- 
ral frefh water lakes in thefe parifhes, containing abun- 
dance of fine trouts ; particularly three lakes in liifmore, 
two of which contain plenty of fine yellow trouts. About 
50 or €0 yeafs ago, there were fome fea trouts carried to 
tliefe lakes, the breed of which preferve their diftindlion per- 

feaiy

fedly clear to this day. They retain their fliining filver fcales, 
though they have no communication with the fea j their fleih 
is as red as that of any falmon, and their tafte is totally dif- 
ferent from that of the yellow trouts. Another fmall lake 
in the ifland contains large eels, but no trouts. Whales arc 
frequently feen about Lifmore in fummer and harveft, when 
they are in purfuit of the flioals of herrings that pafs by to 
Fort William and LochiaL A few herrings are fometimes 
caught in this neighbourhood ; but they feldom remain in 
the bays long enough to be caugnt in great numbers. Seals, 
or feu calves, are caught frequently with nets on funk rocks 
about Lifmore. The fame fea-fifh and fea-fowl as are on the 
reft of the weftern coaft abound here ; Ibch as fcas or cuddies, 
both large and fmall, in vaft fhoals ; red or rock cod, lythes, 
mackerel, and a few flounders. 

Hills. — The hills of Glenco and Bailichelifh are by far the 
higheft in this parifli. The tops of them are conical ; and 
fome of them are thought to be among the raoft romantic in 
Scotland. There is now an excellent line of road carried 
through Glenco, from whence thefe romantic ftupenduous 
hills, when contrafted with the delightful valley below, ap- 
pear uncommon objetfts to ftrangers, and never fail to attraft 
admiration. 

Woods. — There are abundance of natural woods and plant- 
ing on different eftates in Appin. Some old natural grown 
firs remain in a few places in the higher parts of the coun- 
try. 

Animals. — In Lifmore, there are neither rats, moles, or 
foxes. There are otters in great abundance, with a few wild 
scats. Weafels made their appearance here within thefe 12 

yean, 



$f Lifmore and Apptn,

years, but never before ; and they are now very numerous. 
In Appin and Kingerloch, there are moles, weafels, white 
rats, martins, pole cats, wild-cats, common and mountain 
hare ; the laft as white as fnow in winter. There was not a 
common hare in the valleys in Appin, or in the neighbour- 
ing parifli of Ardchallan, ao years ago. There are foxes, 
badgers, and otters, in Appin. In the lower parts of Appin, 
particularly on the Marquis of Tweedel's and Mr Campbell 
of Aird's properties, there are roes in great abur.dance ; not 
the file of the hart, as fome of our Englift Dictionaries falfd- 
ly denominate them ; for the roes have their bucks and does 
as the deer have their harts and hinds. In the higher pails 
of Appin, a few red or mountain deer frequently appear^ 
when they are feared or frightened from the neighbouring 
foreft of Buachail *, &amp;c. A few deer occafionally appear in 
Kiiigerloch ; but the fheep will foon banifli them, as they 
cannot endure to pafture with them ; nor are the roes fond 
of it. The fquirrel is now become very rare, if not totally 
extinft, in this part of the Highlands. 

The birds in this parifh are much the fame as in other 
parts of the Weft Highlands. Eagles abound in Kinger- 
loch, and the higher parts of Appin. together with ptarmi- 
gans, black cocks or heath-fowl, groufe or moor-fowl. There 
are a few partridges in Lifmore and Appin. A variety of 
hawks are found in Lifmore, from the fmalleft kinds to the 
falcon or huriiing hawk. Wild geefe hatch in fome of the 
iflands round Lifmore. Though the very exlftence of the 
jackcbws with red feet and bills is denied by fome of the in- 
habitants

his three renowned fons, Naos or Naois, Ailli, and Ardao,

traditionary hiftory well known in thefe countries.

habitants of the fouth of Scotland, yet there is nothing mors 
certain than that they are to be found hatching in the rocks 
about Lifmore They are nearly of the fame fize with the 
grey-headed ones. The cuckow, fwallow, water-wagtail, 
wood-cock, corn-crake or rail, with the lapwing, or green 
plover, make their appearance at the ftated feafons. In fe- 
vere winters, a few fwans vifit the lakes of this parlfti ; but 
they feldom remain long in tliis country. 

Number of Horfes^ Sheep, CsV, — It is difficult to afcertain 
the number of cattle in thefe parilhes. Very few horfes are 
now bred here ; and all the black cattle bred are princij)ally 
intended for common family ufe. There are 25000 fheep in 
In the parifh, or perhaps many more, as they are daily on 
the increafe. The value of wool here has been always fluc- 
tuating, from 3 s. 9 d. to 6 s. and 7 s. the ftonc, the white, 
and that laid with tar mixed. At an average, from 7 to 8 
fleeces go to a ftone. 

Populatien. — There is no afcertaining whether population 
is on the increafe or decline here, though, at firft view, the 
immenfe tradls of fheep-farms might naturally induce us to 
think it decreafing. The inhabitants amount at prefent to 
3526 fouls. Lifmorc contains 1121 of that number. 

A rage for emigration has got to a great height, of late, in 
the Highlands. There have been two emigrations from thefe 
parifhes, particularly from Appin. The inhabitants are now 
become fo crowded, that fome relief of this fort, in one lhape 
or other, feems abfoluiely neceflTary. In 1775, the firft fliip, 
completely loaded with emigrants, moftly from thefe parifli- 
es, failed for North Carolina. The American war, which 
broke out next year, put a flop to all attempts of this nature 

till 



of Lifmore and Appiiu 489 

till iaft autumn, when another (hip, with emigrants, moftlf 
from Appin, and the higher parts of Ardchattan parifli, car- 
ried away about 200 people for North Carolina. Prepara- 
tions are making for another emigration from thefe pariflies 
this year. 

Birthsy Deaths, and Mafrhges.-^lt is a difficult matter to 
afcertain exactly deaths, births, or marriages, in thefe extcn- 
five parifhes, particularly on account of the great number of 
Epifcopals and feftaries in Appin. It is impoffible to keep 
any regifter of deaths, becaufe there are feven or eight dif- 
ferent places of interment, and fome of thefe at great diftan- 
ces from each other. 'I'here are feveral chriftenings in Glen- 
CD not inferted in the Regifter, as alfo ail that are baptifed 
by the feftaries. 

Rent, ^c. — The rent of thefe paflfhes has increafed 
exceedingly within thefe few years. When the prefent in- 
cumbent gave in a rental lately, in a procefs of augmenta^ 
tion, it amounted only to L,4400 and odd pounds yearly. At 
prefent, the rental is about Li 8000 Sterling yearly, exclufive 
of kelpi woods, &amp;c. Some lands in the parifli are let at los, 
the acre, and fome even higher j but this is not the cafe in 
general. There are 1 7 heritors polTefTed of property in thefe 
parifhes j eight of whom are refident. 

CropSu— The only crops raifed In thefe parifhes are oats, 
barley, and potatoes^ with a little flax. From the fmall trials 
made by a few gentlemen, clover, ryegrafs, and turnips, an- 
fwer very well in both pariflies. The minifter has fown a 
little clover and rye-gf afs on his glebe for 1 8 or 20 years 
paft, and he finds great benefit from it. Moft of the rents 
«f Lifmore are paid in kind, i. e. in meal and. barley. Some

farms in this parifii fovv 20, fome 26 bolls, of barley yearly;, 
and from 60 to 70 bolls of oats. But the returns are very fmall,. 
owing to an unhappy deftre among the formers of labouring 
yearly too m^jch unripe ground, that is, ground that is not 
allowed age fufHTirnt to ftrengthcn it. There is both rock 
and mofs marl in Lifmore in great quantities, and alfo fome 
in Appin. This the tenants often ule with too liberal a hand, 
to the great detriment of fuch ground as is not allowed age 
enough. But the invincible impediment to cultivation in ge- 
neral (bcfides the obftruftion given by the rocks to the 
plo':!^;i in Lifmore) is want of fuel to burn lime. Peats are 
thf only fuel in both parifh^s. The procefs of making them 
in Lilaiore is difficult beyond conception, as they are firfl 
tramp." i and wrought with men*s feet, and then formed by 
the women's hands. There is a neceffity for this ; becaufe 
the (u il,:nce of which they are made contains no fibres to 
cnaoie them to cohere or fticfc together. This tedious o- 
peration confumes much of the farmer's time^ which, in a- 
grain country, might be employed to much better advantage ; 
and afford'^ ferious caufc of regret that the coal-duty is not 
taken off, or leffened, which would remove the everlafting 
bar to the fuccels of the fifhing villages, and to improvements 
in general over all the coafls of Scotland. It may be aver- 
red, with fo.iie degree of confidence, that, unlefs the coaft- 

' duty be in fome lhape altered, the filhmg villages, juilly con- 
lidered at prcfent fuch flattering national objects, mul be 
laid afide. Grain is not fo flrong here as in the fouth^ ow- 
ing to the inceflant r ;ins. Lime would perhaps, in Ibmc

trloch ; and, excepting a few, there is not a Seceder in 
either parifh. There are four or five Papifts in the pa- 
rifh of Appin, all of whom came from other pariflies 
except one man, who was converted by his wife, an Irifli- 
woman. There are great numbers of EpilcopaUans, in tlie 
higher parts of the parifli of Appin ; and a clergyman of their 
own perfuafion refides among them. I here are four places 
of worfliip in the parifli, viz- Lifmore and Appin, Glenco 
and Kingerloch. There is a miffionary eftablifticd bv the 
committee for managing the royal bounty between Gienco 
and the neighbouring glens belonging to the parilh of Ard- 
chattan. The miffionary of Strontian preaches four times in 
the year at Kingerloch. It is the opinion of the judicious, that 
the funds for miflionaries and catechifts Ihould have been all 
alloted, long ago, for building new churches in thefe extenfive 
pariflies. It would unqueftionably turn out to much greater 
advantage to the public. Lifmore was a Bilhop's See . the 
rcfidence of the Bifhop of the Ifles, and, at certain periods, of 
the Bifhop of Argyle. The prefent church ot Lilmore is 
the chancel of the old cathedral new roofed aL-.-'it 4- years 
ago, after lowering the old w^lls from ten to feven fc^ '^he 
font and confeffional chair remain. The w .lis of the Bi- 
fliop's CaRle ftill remain pretty entire, four miles ro the weft 
of the cathedral. It has a fquare open court vvithin. There 
was a fmall temple, with a burying ground, on an iflunJ, 
or rather peninlula, called Bernera, on the farm where the 
caftle itands. In Appin, there is a neat, fmall church, lav.ly 
repaired. The church yard is inclofed with a wall ot lu -ie 
and lime. The nvanle in Lifmore i'= not very good. It was 
buiit about 34 years ago, and repaired withi" thele 20 years.

tained. The pofterity of the fextons hold a fmall piece of 
free land, that fetches a rent of about L. 12 Sterling yearly. 
They held their charter (a Latin one) originally from the 
Bifhops, on exprefs condition that they were to preferve 
the baculum rnqre, probably the crofier. Twenty-five years 
ago, the property paid only L. 4 Sterling yearly rent. It is 
fuppofed to be among the oldeft properties in the parilh, 
handed down regularly in a lineal fuccefEon. Buchanan, iu 
his Hiftory of Scotland, aflerts that, In his time, there were 
ibme remains of religious houfes in the iflands Dreinich and 
Ramafa, on the north Cde of Lilmore. Dr Walker, Profeffbr 
of Natural Hiftory at Edinburgh, and the prefent incumbent, 
fearched for thefe ruins 26 years ago, but no veftiges of 
them were then to be found. 

Poor. — ^The poor are fupported chiefly by the the charity 
of the inhabitants, by begging from houfe to houfe. Any 
fupport they get here from the kirk-felEon is pot adequate 
to their maintenance. From L. 18 to L. 20 are diitributed 
in both parifties, arifing from the Sunday coUeftions, fines, 
and fome other finall funds. The Epifcopal congregation 
contribute fometlmes one or two guineas a year, to make up 
the above fum. 



ScMs, — There is ^ parochial fchool in Lifaiore, and ano- 
ther 



»f Li/more and Appin,

tli€r in Appin, with a falary to each of them, from L. 1 8 to 
L. 20 Sterling yearly, over and above the fchool emolu- 
ments. The falaries arife in part from a parochial affeffment 
of 4 d. in the pound of old valued rent, amounting to 200 
merks Scots yearly, and partly from money mortified by 
King William for eftablifhing fchools in thefe parifhes. 
There is an excellent good new fchool-houfe in Appin. The 
fchool-houfc in Lifmore is very bad ; but there is money for 
building a new one. There is one fchool, with a falary of 
L. 10 Sterling yearly, at the Slate Quarry in Glenco, grsnt- 
ed by the Society for propagating Chriftian Knowledge. The 
number of fcholars is fo fluctuating, that they cannot be eafily 
afcertained. The fchool in the Straith of Appin confiils of 
60, and fometimcs 80 fcholars. The Society School at the 
Slate Quarry confifts of about as many ; and the one in Lif- 
more of 40. or 50. There are fometimes one/?r more linaller 
khools kept up at the ex pence of the inhabitants in the 
more remote parts of the pariflies. 

Ant'iquiiies. — There are fome Druidical cairns, or conical 
heaps of Itones, in different places in the parifhes, which for- 
merly contained urns or earthen vafes filled with alhes, and 
fome pieces of human bones. One of thefe cairns, of very 
confiderable magnitude, and of a regularly conical lonn, 
ftands within a very fmail diftance of the cathedral. One 
of thefe earthen vafes or urns, containing afhes, and pieces of 
hum^n fculls and bones, was turned up laft year by the 
plough in a neighbouring farm. In the ifland of Lifmore, 
there are feveral veftiges of Roman fortifications ; and parti- 
cularly an old caftle, with a fufee and draw-bridge, faid to 
have been built by the Danes, or Scandinavians, when they 
infefted thefs coafts. There is alfo, within half a miie of the 
pathedral, one of ths circular towers fo frefjuently to be met 

with 



494- Siatijlkal Account 

with in the Ifle of Skyc, and on the weftern coaft of Scot- 
land, and which Dr Johnfon, contrary to the general opi- 
nion, ridiculoufly aflerts to liave been ere£led for preferving 
the cattle from the depredations of thieves ia the night-time. 
Thefe towers have been probably intended, partly at leaft, 
for raifing beacons or fires on them, to alarm the coaft 
and country, on the approach of enemies. For this rea- 
fon, the greateft care has been always taken to place them in 
a fituation commanding a moft extenfive view, fo as to be 
feen from the neighbouring towers and heights. In conftruft- 
ing the walls of the tower in this ifland, neither hme nor 
mortar of any fort is ufed. 

Curhftties. — ^The prodigious ftrata of marl, from lo to i6 
feet deep, in the bottoms of all the lakes in Lifmore, may 
be ranked am«?ng the curiofities in this parifh. There is 
in this ifland, in the face of a lime-ftone rock, feven or eight 
feet above the furface of the ground, and quite beyond the 
reach of tides, a feam, 12 or 15 inches broad, of a concre- 
tion, compofed of all the varieties of fhells to be found on 
thefe coafts, with now and then a fmall mixture of charcoal, 
as firm, and nearly as folid, as the rock furrounding it, to 
which it feems to be perfectly united, and to make a part. 
Pieces of it have been carried to Edinburgh. Water running 
over the face of the lime-ftone rocks in this ifland generally 
diflblves fofter particles of it, and leaves the more folid parts 
in a variety of fanciful grotefque figures. 

The lime-flone rocks in Lifmore lie all in one direction, in 
layers, one above another, nearly from fouth-eafl to north- 
weft. There are feams or fpars three or four feet broad, of 
remarkably hard flinty rocks or flones running acrofs the 
ifland, at the difiance of 1 1 or 2 miles, Thefe feams appear 

in 



of Lifmore and Apptn, 495 

\ti a (liredl line with thofe in Lifmore, on the oppofite coaft of 
Blorvein, where there is no lime-ftonc. But, of all the curi- 
ofities in this ifland, the mod remarkable feem to be deer, 
and perhaps elk-horns, of great fize, and cow-horns of ftill 3 
much greater fize in proportion. The pith of one of the 
latter, though much fhrivelled and withered, is 12 inches ia 
circumference at the root. Tradition afferts that this ifland 
was of old a deer-foreft ; and the number of deer-horns, and 
a deer-fkeleton found quite entire, confirms the alTertion. \t 
is faid that the feventh moft fuccefsful hunting-chace which 
Fingal ever had was in this ifland ; -and the inhabitants pre- 
tend to point out Slia nan ban fionn^ the hill or eminence of 
the Fingalian fair ladies, on which they fat to view the di- 
verfion. 

Language. — The common hnguage of the parifli is the 
Gaelic, a branch of the annent Celtic. The names of all the 
places iu the parifli are manifeftly derived from it. The mi- 
nifter preaches, in the long days, both in Gaelic and £ng- 
lifli ; particularly in Appin, where there are fome who un- 
derftand Englifli only. It is believed that few preachers in 
any part of the world, except thofe in the Highlands, preach 
in two languages. This is one of the many inconveniencies 
under which a clergyman labours in thefe extcnfive parifhes. 

I'rtces of Provifiens and Labour. — As there is no public 
market in thefe parifhes, there is no polHbility of afcertain- 
uig the price of grain or provifions. Barley generally fells 
from 1 8 s. to 20 s. and 2i s. the boll; meal from 14 s. to 
16 s. ; butter generally for 12 s. the ftone, (this ftone fhould 
be 24 lb.), and cheefe for 5 s. and 6 s. the ftone. What is 
fold in fpring, or late in the feafon, is often at a higher price. 
Moft of the work in thele pariflies is managed by fer/ants 

hired 



496 Stati/lical Account 

hired for the year, and maintained by the refpeftive families 
that employ them. As the Jufticcs of the Peace found ic 
impradlicable to fix any ftandard for fervants wages, it is in 
vain to attempt faying any thing decidedly on this fubjeft. 
One man pays fervants, both men and women, a third, and 
fometimes one half, more than others, owing to the diffe- 
rence both of treatment and the manner in which they are 
employed. Such as work for day's wages have from 8 d. to 
1 s. a day, and maintain themfelves. At fevere work, fuch 
as kelp-making, wood-cutting, and coaling, &amp;c. they have 
much more. A taylor has 6 d. or 8 d. and his victuals j and 
a fhoemaker much the fame ; carpenters, and other mecha- 
nics, I s. or I s. 2 d. and their vi£luals. 

Services. — Although perfonal fervices performed by tenants 
ftill prevail in different parts of the Highlands, they are be-' 
coming obfolete in thefe parifhes. The fervices were feldom 
difcretionary, but limited. Some tenants go from this ifland 
to the main-land to perform thefe fervices, at the diflance of 
8 or 9 miles. They devote at leaft 6 or 7 days yearly to 
their mafter's or landlord's fervice in this way ; and they get 
fome allowance, for the moft part, to fupport them while 
performing their work. This is over and above 2 or 3 days 
that fome of them work yearly at roads. Some proprietors 
in neighbouring parifhes carried thefe fervices to a fhameful, 
not to fay opprefKve, pitch, in obliging their tenants and 
cottagers to cut, ftack, and houfe their peats, &amp;c, and to find 
their own provifions all the time. This is one of the innu- 
merable grievances occafioned by the heavy coal duty. 

Roads and Bridges. — Since the refidence of the prefent in- 
cumbent in the parifh, roads and bridges have undergone a 
remarkable change for the better, elpecially in Appin. There 



of Lifmore and Apphi, 497 

16 an excellent line of road, nioft[y finiflied, from Shian Ferry 
through Airds, Strath of Appin, Duror, and Glenco, to the 
King's Iloule at Lubnamart, with 6 or 7 bridges, for a courfe 
of 17 or 18 computed miles, befides- feveral by-roads. Lalt 
year a line of road has been opened to Glencreren. There 
has been little done to the roads in Lifmore. There are no 
lolls in the Highlands. 

Pojl- Office. — When the prcfent incumbent came to the pa- 
rilli, and ic;veral years afterwards, the neareft poft-oflice was 
at Inverary ; and a few of the gentlemen of Appin employed 
;i runner, who went once a week to Inverary to bring their 
letters, newfpapers, &amp;c. Mr Seaton of Touch, who bought 
the eftate of Appin (a gentleman particularly attentive to 
the good of the parifh, and of the country in general) after 
niuch trouble and folkitation, got a poft-olEce eftabliflied in 
Appin, becoming himfelf fecurity for making good any defi- 
ciency that might happen. For feveral years the office bare- 
ly fupported the expence of the runner, &amp;c. ; but the circu- 
lation of correfpondcnce increafed fo rapidly, that this iaft 
year it made a clear return to the revenue of about L. 74 
Sterling, which would defray the whole coal duty of this 
county yearly, as it ftood lately, by a ftate taken from the 
Cuftomhoufe books. A runner goes now thrice every week 
from Appin to Bunaw, and from Bunaw to Inverary, and re- 
turns as often. A branch of this poft-office extends from 
Bunaw to Oban ; and from Oban, where there is a Cuftom- 
houfe, to Arofs in the Ifland of Mull. Another branch ex- 
tends from Appin to Fort William, the north line, and like- 
wife to Stroniian. A letter may come in three days, or even 
two days and a half, from Edinburgh to Appin. The efta- 
blilhment of this poft-office contributes highly to the plea- 
fure and advantage of this country and the neighbourhood 

Vol. I. 3 R though 



Statlflkal Account 



though it muft be acknowledged that it cofts nearly L. 7a 
Sterling yearly. Numbers of carriers are employed monthly 
between Appin Ecnderloch, Oban, andGlafgow; and vef- 
fels calkd packets run generally once a month between Green- 
ock, Oban, and Mull, with goods of various forts for the ae- 
coramodation of the neighbouring countries. The poft-of- 
fice in Appin is at prefent kept by Mr John M'Laren fchool- 
inuder, for a Imall falary of not raore than about L. 5 Ster- 
ling yearly. 

Majfacre of Glenca. — It were to be wifhed that a veil could 
be thrown over this part of our hiftory, as it was the moft bar- 
barous tranfaftion of modern times fandtioncd by any regular 
authority from government. The maflacre of Glenco hap- 
pened in King William's reign^ and is a circumftance well 
known. As it dots not add much luftre to the humanity of 
the times, it may fulEce to obferve, that all the inhabitants 
who could be feized were indifcriminately butchered in cold 
blood, moftly in their beds, by the foldiers and officers who 
were their guefts, and hofpitably entertained for ten days be- 
fore. The officers were playing cards with Glenco and Mrs 
M'Donald the early part of the night : Before day, Glencc 
was murdered in his wife's arms. Mr M'Donald of Achtri- 
chatain fhared the fame fate. 

Public Houjes. — In Kingerloch there are 2 public houfcs, 
at the two ferries to Lifmore and Appin, where they cannot 
be wanted ; in Appm there are 9 or 10 ; in Lifmore 7 or 8. 
Thefe houfes cannot be fuppofed to improve the morals of 
the people; though, in a country fituated as this is, a few of 
them cannot oe wanted. Four or five of thofe in Appin are 
flare houfes, and pretty well kept } the others are but of a 
very ordinary kind. 



Lifimn and Appln* 499 

Sea CoaJIs and Currents^ ^c. — There is a vaft extent of fea- 
coaft in thefe parifhes ; perhaps from 80 to 90 m'les in all 
direftions. Where it lies contiguous, a great deal of fea- 
weed is ufed for manuring the ground for barley and pota- 
toes. There is a violent current between the weft end of 
Lifmore and Mull, well known to fea-faring people, at the 
dangerous rock of Carrig, which is covered with the tide at 
high water. There are a number of fmaller currents, though 
not fo deferving of notice. There is a fmall, but ftrong one, 
at the Ferry of Bailichelifli, leading up to Lochleven and the 
flate quarry. There is a pretty ftrong one at the ferry be- 
tween Lifmore and Appin, and another at Shian Ferry, be- 
tween Appin and Benderloch, Between the weft end of Lif- 
more and Morvein three ftreams meet, in confequence of 
contrary tides, which, in tempeftuous weather, occafion a 
fmart fwell and broken feas. All the above currents change 
their courfes regularly with the tides. The beft anchoring 
about the ifland, for veflels of any burden, is in the narrow 
found between Ramafa and Lifmore, near the north point of 
the ifland. There is likewife very fafe anchoring a little to 
the weft of Ramafa, in the Bay of Ifland Lochofcair, (' /icar's 
Ifland), by Buchanan ternisd Molochafcair ^ where vefTels of 
any burden can conveniently ride in . pretty fafe road, and 
free of any breakers. 

Mines., flanks, i^fc: — Several appearances of lead naines 
are to be found in Appin : Only one of them was attempted to 
be wrought, but it did not turn out to any advantage. There 
is fome appearance of marble in Appin ; but the flate quarry 
of Bailichelifli, at Laroch inGlenco, is the only quarry of this 
nature in the parifh that has turned out to any material ad- 
vantage *. There are a great number of hands at work ; 

and 

* There are 74 families in the quarry, contalnipg 3:2 fouls. 



500 Stafi/lical Account 

and a great quantity of flatcs are "fent yearly to the north auJ 
eaft countries, to Leith, Clyde, England, Ireland, and even 
to America. VelTels of any burden can load mof^ comnao- 
dioufly in fine fmooth land, fo near the lliore, that they may 
be loaded by throwing a few planks between the vcffels and 
the fhore ; and there is little or no f\yeU in the road. The 
quahty of the flates is thought very good. Burning of lime 
for iale has beep begun by adventurers in Lifmore and Ap^- 
pin; and, as the lime is of a rnofb fuperior qualUyj th.'S un- 
dertaicing might turn out to advantage, not only to th,e ad- 
venturers, hut to th^e public at large, as an encouragement to 
building, hufbandry, Sic. \vei;e it not for the check given to 
it by the coa,l duty. 

Advantages and Difadvantages. — The prmclpal advantage \i\ 
thefe pariflies is the vaft extent of fea-coaft, with bays and 
inlets. The fnow feldom lies deep or long on the fea-coO, 
a circjumftpjice highly favoiirahle to fheep and black cattle. 
The good roads and bridges in Appin are of great and general 
ntility. Peats -ire the common fuel of the country, but they 
take up the very beft p.:irt of the feafon to fecure, them. The 
fr?iuent fains h^re often deftroy fome of this paf t of th£ farw 
mer's induftry. The high duty go coals is the greateft dif- 
a,Jvantage thefe pafifties labours under, and prove an unfur* 
mountable bar to manufoflures and improvements of all forts. 
Xhe want of public eftabliflied markets is, likevvlfe a great dif- 
s,dvantage. A ton of coals cofts frpm t8 s. to iis. and 24 s«, 
The duty, on fait is likewife a great grievance, as managed at 
pj-efent, and.requires to be remedied. The tremble of preparing^ 
zjid the tme confvimed by the inhabitants in fecuri«g their fuel 
in Lifn^ore in particular^ wliere attention to their crops and til- 
hge, would take up ali the labour they could fpafe, is a moft 
furious grievance, and to be remedied only by an alteration 



of tifmre and App'm, 5*1 

in the coal duty. This is an object of high national concern, 
in which the gentlemen of property are moft deeply inte- 
refted, and to which, it is hoped, they will pay particular at- 
tention J and, if they wilh that thefe countries fhould ever 
turn out to any proper account in the way of manufac- 
tures, tillage, or any other improvements, they fliould all 
unite as one man to endeavour to reftify this grievance, and 
get their country relieved from fo unhappy a nuifance. 

Mifcellamotts Olfervatiofis.— 'There is a remarkable echo 
riear the Bilhop's old caftle at Achinduin : It repeats diftindl- 
ly feven or eight fyllabies. There is another at an old caftle 
in Kingerloch, much the fame as the above. There are five 
diflerent remains or ruins of old caftles in thefe parifhcs. On 
the fputh fide of Lifmore, oppofite to Oban, there ftands on 
a fmall ifland, (Eilleanna cloich), a curious rock, covered ia 
part with ivy, and perfeiSHy refembling the ruins of an ol4 
houfe. Mr Pennant was fo flruck with its romantic appear- 
ance, that he made it the frontifpiece to the laft volume of 
his travels. Several eftates in thefe parifhes have been re- 
gularly furveyed ; but where there are fo many proprietors, 
and the whole not furveyed, it is impoflible to afcertain the 
number of acres. 

The people in this parifh are, in general, laborious and in- 
duftrious. Crimes of an enorrpous nature are hardly known 
here. No inftance of fuicide, or of murder, has occurred 
for 25 years paft. The common people are lefs addifted to 
drinking than they were 20 years ago. All ranks are remark- 
able for their charity to the poor. In fevere feafons, many of 
them double their attention to relieve the wants of the needy. 
No inhabitant of thefe extenfive pariflies has been executed 
or baniflied for 25 years paft. One or two perfons, guilty 

of 



502 Statijlical Account 

of forae irregularities, voluntarily baniflied themfelves. There 
lias been no inftance of child murder in the parifh in the 
memory of man. This is a crime hardly known in the weft 
Highlands. The people in this part are much lefs fluftuat- 
ing in their religious opinions than they are to the fouth- 
ward. 

A man of Angular frame was born in Appin. He was the 
ftouteft or thickeft man in Britain, or even perhaps in Eu- 
rope, at the time. His name was Carmichael. He was a 
foldier in the 42d regiment, and died above 30 years ago. 
He was faid to be not above fix feet high but was fo Angu- 
lar for the ftoutnefs of his make, that his portrait, as large 
as the life, was painted, by order of the King, and placed in 
the Tower of London as a curiofity. He was noted for the 
mildnefs of his difpofition. He could carry on his back, with 
cafe, I cwt. more than the ftrongeft porter in Dublin.

PARISH OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1018733">MEIGLE</name>. 

By the Rev. Dr James Platitair.</head> 

<p>

Situation and Extent. 

TH £ parlOi of Meigle, in the center of Strathmore, h 
bounded on the north-weft and north by the rivers of 
Ifla and Dean ; on the eaft and fouth by the pariflies of Eflay, 
Ncvay, and Newtyle ; on the fouth-weft and weft by thofe of 
Ketins and Coupar; lying in 56° 36' N. lafitude, and 5' E. 
longitude from Edinburgh i being 4^ miles from S. W. to 
N. E. and I — 2 miles broad. 

Strathmore — Is an extenfive plain, reaching from the vici- 
nity of Perth to Brechin, ahnoft 40 miles long, and 4 — 6 
broad, bounded by two ridges of mountains. The fouth 
ridge, called Sidla, extends from Perth caftward to Red-head, 
a promontory on the coaft of the German Ocean, between 
Arbroath and Montrofe. The Grampians form the northern 
boundary, and traverfe the ifland. The elevation of feveral 
mountains on the borders of the Strath has been afcertained 
by barometrical meafurement, as follows : Dunfinnan-hill, on 
which a caftle or fort was erefted by Macbeth, io24j feet 
above the level of the fea at low water mark ; King-feat, a 
rriilc eaftward, 1238 feet} the meridian mark of Belmont,

759 feet; Kinpurnic-hlll, noteJ for a tower on its fummk, 
3 miles S. E. of Belmont, 1151 feet j Sidla-hlll, a mile S. Eo 
ofKinpurnie, 1406 feet; Barry-hill, on the oppofite border 
of the Strath, 3 miles northward of Belmont, 688 feet. This 
level and fertile Strath is beautifully diverfified with planta- 
tions of trees, cultivated fields, towns, villages, and feats : 
But feveral confiderable tracts are ftill barren, and covered, 
with heath. 

Rivers.— river Ifla has its fource In the Grampian 
Mountains, feveral miles northward of Mount Blair. Bathing 
the foot of that mountain, it turns eaftward, traverfes longi- 
tudinally the narrow valley of Glenlila, below which it forms 
a cafcade, called the Reeky Linny upwards of 30 feet high. 
Afterwards, proceeding through a deep and rocky channel, it 
is augmented by two fmall dreams at the bafe of a rocky penin- 
fula, on which lie the ruins of Airly Caftle, which was antient- 
ly a ftrong fortrefs, conftrufled at different periods, and demo- 
liflied during the Commonwealth. Thence the Ma defcends 
with rapidity into the plain, and runs fouthward near a plea- 
fant feat formerly called Ruthven, now Ifla-bank. Suddenly 
changing the direftion of its courfe to W. 8. W. it llowly 
moves, in a winding paffage, through a flat country, which 
it frequently inundates, receives the Ericht two miles north 
of Cupar, and falls into the Tay at Kincleven. There are 
three bridges on the Ifla ; one between the lower extremity 
of Glenifla and Airly Caftle another near the church of 
Ruthven ; and a third a mile N. W. of Cupar. In the 
neighbourhood of Meigle, there is a ferry-boat on the Ifla, 
in the road from Dundee to Alyth. Several attempts have

fons, the Ifla and Ericht prove very prejudicial to the adja- 
cent fields. Increaled by many rapid torrcts, they overflow 
their banks, and fometimes, with refiftlels force, I'weep away 
whole harvefts, and ruin " the well earned trealures of thd 
" labouring year." 

The Oean flows from the lake of Forfar, pafl'es by Glammis 
Caftle, in meanders glides gently along the north borders 
of EfTay and Meigle, and ioics itfclf in the Ifla, half a mile 
N. N. W. of the town of Meigle. T he courfe of this river, 
in a diren: line, does not exceed 10 mdes. Acrofs it is a 
narrow and badly conftrudted bridge, in the road from Cupar 
to Kirriemuir. 

A rivalet originates in Kinpurnie-hill, runs N. W. through 
the panfli of NTewtyle, waters the weftern part of this panfh^ 
and augments the Dean a mile above the influx of that river 
into the ifla. 

Antiquities. — There are many remains of antiquity in this 
parifli and neighbourhood; but, with regard to thefe, tra- 
dition gives us little mformation, and antient records ftill lefs; 
The accounts handed dov?n through each I'ucceeding genera- 
tion are grofsly corrupted. The tales and flories related by 
fabulous writers are, for the moft part, too wild and extra- 
vagant to merit belief. Abandoning, therefore, all iuch le- 
gends to thofe who can rind mflruction or entertainment ia 
them, we fhall proceed to a review of the moft remarkable 
monuments of antiquity in this corner, taking notice of the 
moft plaufible conjedtures concerning them.

fought and fell and, at fome diftance, a ftone of granite, 
' 20 tons in weight, ftands almoft erecl, to conimenioratev it is 
faid, the death of one of his generals : But that tyrant, it is 
more probable, was flain at Lumphanan, a village in the Mearns. 

In the church-yard of Meigle are the remains of the grand 
fepulchfal monument of Vanora, alfo called Vanera, Wanor, 
and Guinevar, the Britifli Helena, as her naiue, according to 
Prideaux, imports. This princeis was the wife of Arthur, 
who flouriflied m the 6th century, and whofe hiftory is in- 
volved in fables. In a battle between the army of that mo- 
narch and the united forces of Scots and Pidls, Vanora was 
taken prifoner, and carried, along with other fpoils, into 
Angus, where fiie lived fome time in niiferable captivity on 
Barry-hilL Such is the doubtful account recorded in the 
ant:cnt annals of this country. The chara£Ver of that unfor- 
tunate perfonage has been drawn in the blackeft colours. She 
has been reprefented as one who led a lafclvious life, and held 
an unlawful corrcfpondence with Mordred, a Piflifli king, 
which provoked the jealoufy of her hufbnnd, and excited him 
to take up arms in revenge of the injury. As a punifliment 
of her enormous crimes, it is added, flie was torn in pieces 
by wild beafts ; her body was buried at Meigle, and a monu- 
ment erefted to perpetuate her infamy. Whether this detail 
be genuine, or has arifen from the fynibolic charadters on the 
ftones, it is innpoffibk to determine. 

That monument feems to have been compofed of many 
ftones artfully joined, and decorated with a variety of hiero- 
glyphical or fymbolical charadters, molt of which are of the 
rnonftrous kind, and reprelent afts of violence on the perfon 
of .\ woman. On one ftone are three fmall crofles, with many 
animals above and below. On another is a crofs adorned 

viih 



o/Magk. s^7 

with various flowers, and the rude reprelcnt.itlons of lillies, 
beads, anil men on horfe-^ack. On a third is an open cha- 
riot drawn by two horfes, and foine perfons in it ; behind is 
a wild beait devouring an hnman form lying proftrate on the 
earth. On a fourth is animal foniewhat refembling an 
elephant. On another, 8 ftet long, and 3 feet 3 inches broad, 
ftanding upright in a focket, there is a crofs. In the middle 
are feveral figures with the bodies of hories, or camels, and 
the heads of ferpents ; on each fide of which are wild beafl.' 
and reptiles confiderably impaired. On the reverfe is tl.c 
figure of a woman, attacked on all fides by dogs atid other 
furious anixnals. Above are feveral perlons on l\ori;.back, 
with hounds, engaged in tiie chace. IjcIovv is a centaur, ar.il 
a fcrpent of enormous fize fattened on the mouth or a bull. 
Accurate drawings of thole ilunes are to be foimd In Pen- 
nant's Tour. Many other ilones, which originally belonged 
to this monument, have been carried otF, or broken m piece.?, 
by the inhabitants of this place. As leveral of thole wlncli 
remain have been removed from their proper polirion ; a;; 
many of the figures are defaced ; and as we are, in a great 
mealure, unacquainted with the art of decyphcring liierogly- 
phics, the hiftory delineated on Vanora's monument is now 
irrecoverably lofl. The antiquary 1 lay amufe himi'clf with 
the fragments which remain ; but he can fcarcely form one 
plaufible conjecture with refpedl to their original meaning 
and defign. The fabulous Boece records a tradition prevail- 
ing in his time, viz that, if a young woman fj^all wAk over 
the grave of Vanora, flie fliall entail on herl'cif perpetual fte- 
rllity. But, whatever apprehenfions of this nature the fair 
fex m his time might have entertained, the nioft credulous 
are not now affraid of making the experinicnt. 



Barry- hill, 



^o8 Statiflical Account 

Barry-hill, the fuppofed place of Vanora's confinement, 
merits fo..ie defcription. It is one of the Grampians, i \ mile 
N. E. of Alyth, it commands an extenfive view of Strath- 
morc, and of feveral remarkable hills in the Sidla range, viz. 
Dunfinnan, Kinpurnie, Sidla, Fmhaven, &amp;c. all of which 
might have been antiently ufed as watch towers, or places of 
defence. Hiftory informs us that the Pidts kept polTelEon 
of Dun-barry, and the aujacent country, from a remote pe- 
riod to the pth century, or later ; but the precife dates of 
their iettlement in thofe parts, and of their expuUion, can- 
not be afcertained The hill itfelf is of an oval form. Its 
fummit was levelled into an area i8o fctt long, and 

7 2 or. 

74 broad. Around the area a mound of earth was raiftd, 
from 6 to 8 feet high, and lo to I2 broad at top. On this 
mound a wall of free-ftone was built without any cement 
whatever. The foundation of the wall was compofed of 
roui^h granite, and ftill remains. It is of the fame breadth 
with the fummit of the mound; but the height of the wall 
cannot be known : Gordon's eftimate of it is extremely erro- 
neous. Among the ruins there are feveral pieces of vitrified 
ftone but thefe vitrifications muft have been accidental, as 
they are few and inconfiderable. Along the weft and north 
borders of the area, barracks, or huts, were buih of dry ffone, 
and fufficiently (heltered by the mound and wall ; but no 
ftrudtures of this fort can be traced in the fouth part of the 
area. As the north and well fides of the hill are fleep, and 
of diiKcult accefs, there was no need of an outer ditch in 
thole quarters : But, towards the fouth and eaft, where the 
hili genily flopes, there is a ditch lo feet broad, and I2 to i6 
feet below the foundation of the wall. At the S. £. extre- 
mity of the fort, a narrow bridge was raifed over the ditch, 
1 8 feet long, and 2 broad, except towards each end, where 
the breadtii was increafed. It was compofed of Hones laid 

together 



ej Meigle, 509 

together without much art, and vitrified above, below, and 
on both fides ; fo that the whole mafs was firmly cemented. 
That an opening was left below, after the procefs was finifh- 
ed, is doubtful. On the upper part of the bridge a ftratuin 
of gravel was laid, to render the paflage fmooth and eafy. 
This is the fole part of the fort intentionally vitrified A few 
yards dillant from the ditch, there is an outer wall, the foun- 
dation of which is about 8 feet lower than the fummit of the 
mound. The approach to the fort is from, the N. E. along 
the verge of a precipice ; and the entrance was fecured by a 
bulwark of ftone, the ruins of which are extant. There is 
110 veftige of a well wiihia the fort ; but, weftward, between 
the bafis of the mound and the precipice, there was a deep 
pond or lake, recently filled up by the tenants in that neigh- 
bourhood. About a quarter of a mile eaftward, on the de- 
clivity of the hill, there are fome remains of another oval 
fort, of lefs extent than the preceding, confifiing of a ftrong 
wall and ditch. Tradition fays, that there was a fubterra- 
nean communication between thefe forts, which is not im- 
probable. From the account now given, it would appear, 
1. That both were conftrufted before the Romans introduced 
the art of building with lime and other ce.iient. 2. ihat the 
Pidts, and antient Scots had ftone edifices, which Macpher- 
fon is not inclmed to admit. 3. That they fometimes vitri- 
fied particular parts of their forts, to render them the more 
durable. 

There is no veftige of a Roman highway In the neighbour- 
hood of iNIeigle, though traces of one have been difcovered 
in other parts of the country. At Cupar are extant the out- 
lines of a camp formed by Agricola's army in his leventh 
year's expedition. On the praetorium, Malcolm iV by the 
advice of his grandfather, founded an abbey for the reception 



510 Statijlkal Account 

of Cifterclan Friars, A. U. 1 1O4, and endowed it with a cou- 
fiderable revenue. 

Population. — About a century ago, a confiderable part of 
this parifh, viz the eftates of Kinloch and Bamyle, belonged 
to that of Cupar. From a lift then given in to the prefby- 
tery by the Bifliop of Brechin, it appears, that, in Cupar, 
there were 8;o communicants, and 550 in Mcigle. Accor- 
ding to the report tranfmitted to Dr Webfter, A. D. 1739, 
concerning the population f the latter, it contained 1000 in- 
habitants: But that report was not accurate; for. tiiougli its 
numbers have bd n confiderably diminifhed lince that period, 
it ftill contains 1148, mchiding all ages and denominations. 
There are 86 below 3 years; 165 from 3 to 10; 269, 10 — 
20; 188,20—^1;; 14J :c - 40,97,50 — Oo;43, 60 — 70; 
20. 7 . — 80 ; ana 8 froui 80 to yo. 

Rating the entire number at 11 50, the proportions of cer- 
tain ages are nt arly as follows, viz j'-j- below 3 years ; 4- ^roin 
3 ro !o; J., 10—20; 20—^0; 4.. 30—40; ^, 40—50; 
J 5, 50—60 ; 5'^, 60 — 70 5 -j-V* 7c-r-bo i and from 80 to 
90. 

In 1 148 inhabitants, there are 37 unmarried perfons of 
both fexes who have houfes ; 163 married pairs; 42 of both 
fexes in widowhood ; and 242 famihes ; fo that the number 
of v'idowed perfons of both fexes is to that of married pairs 
as I to 4 nearly. There are born annually 37t*'oV children ; 
viz. 20^'~ males, and 1 7 ^^-^ females : So that 64- families 
nearly, produce i child a year. The proportion of the births 
to that of the whole inhabitants is as I to 30^^^. There are 
marriages annually. 

The

■ The proportion of perfons who die at certain a^es every year is 
as follows, viz y below 3 years ; i^''^from 3 to 10 ; 2, 10 — 20 j 
20—30; 2, 30—40-, 2,'^, 40— 50 i 50—60; 2io* 
60 - 70 i 3/^, '0 — ao i 1 from 80 to go : in all 3 1, or ^'^ of 
the whole inhabitants. The proportion of females to males 
who die yearly is 16 to 15 ; the rcverfe of what is ufually 
ftated in bills of mortality. The proportion of births to deaths 
is 38 to 3 I nearly. 

The whole parifli is divided among eight proprietors. The 
valued rent is L. 4200 : 1 7 : 2 Scots ; and the real rent is 
about fix times that fum. 

Tow/is, Ss'r. —There is no town or village of any note in 
the parifh. Meigle, an antient, inconfiderable, meanly built, 
market town, contaming 2ti inhabitants, is pleafantly fitua- 
ted on a rivulet of the fime name, in the center of the pa- 
rifh, at the inrerledlion of two turnpike roads, 1 2 miles N. W. 
of Dundee, 6i N. E. of Cupar, and 52 S. W of Glammis. 
The weekly market is on Wednefday. Annual fairs are held 
on the laft Wednefday of June and of O5lober. Meigle was 
a village, and burying place, befor.- the introduiflion of Chrif- 
tianity, as appears from fome iepulchral monuments and tomb- 
ftones lately found in the walls of the church. 

Seats, — There are three feats in the moft advantageous fi- 
tuations ; and two of them are in good repair. Belmont 
Caftle, a modern edifice, ftands on a gentle eminence, 204 
feet above the level of half flood mark at Panbride, and com- 
mands an extenfive view of the plain. Finifhed in the neat- 
eft and moil commodious manner, it contains a confiderable 
number of elegant apartments, with a library confifting of a 
felett colleftion cf books, chiefly mathematical, claflical, and 

hiftorical,

hiftorical, of the beft editions. The obfervatory, on an ad- 
joining lawn, is in 56° 35' N. latitude, and 3° ii' 15" W. 
longitude from the royal obfervatory at Greenwich. The 
gardens and fine inclofures, with which this place is furround- 
ed, confpire to render it the moft delightful refidence in 
Strathmore. Drumkilbo and Kinloch are plpafantly fituated : 
But the latter is in a ruinous condition. 

Church. — Meigle is the feat of a prefbytery, containing 1 3 
pariflies, in the fynod of Angus and Mearns. Formerly it 
was annexed to the fee of Dunkeld. Several of the Bifhops 
of that diocefe refided here ; and two of them, viz. James 
Nicolfon and William Lindfay, were interred in the church. 
The firft prefbyterian clergyman was Mr Millar, who being 
tranflated to the Grayfriars in Edinburgh i\ D. 1709, was 
fucceeded bv David Thompfon, who ferved the cure 47 years. 
His lucceflbr, Alexander Scot, was removed from Kingol- 
drum to this place A D 1757, and died in November 1776. 
In the year following, Dr James Playtair. the prelent incum- 
bent, was tranflated from Newtyle. The ftipend of this pa- 
rifh is 9 chalders of vidtual, and about L. 4 Sterling vicarage. 
The King is patron. The greater part of the ftipend of 
Dunkeld is paid out of this parifh. The church was lately 
rebuilt, and the manle is in tolerable repair On all occa- 
fions the heritors have exprefled their alacrity in granting 
whatever is neceflary to the fupport of thefe fabrics. 

School. — The parochial fchool is endowed with a falary of 
L. too Scots, befi.les a dwelling- houfe and fmall garden. 
The profits and emoluments ariling from 45 fcholars are 
about L. 16 a year The feffion- clerk's fee is L. 1:10:0, 
and his perquifites L.. 2 : i o : o. The prelent incumbent, by

age incapacitated from teachi.^g, the education of the youth 
has, for lome time paft, been committed to an affiftant. 

Improvements. — Since the year 1745, a fortunate epoch for 
Scotland in general, improvements have been carried on with 
great ardour and fuccefs. At that time, the ftate of this coun- 
try was rude beyond conception^ The molt fertile trafts were 
*pafte, or indifferently cultivated, and the bulk of the inhabi- 
tants were uncivilized. The education, manners, drefs, fur- 
niture, and table, of the gentry, were not fo liberal, decent, 
and fumptuous, as thofe of ordinary farmers at prefent. The 
common people, clothed in the coarfeft garb, and ftarving 
on the meaneft fare, lived in defpicable huts with their 
cattle. 



The half ploughed fields yielded fcanty crops, and ma- 
nufaftures lirarcely exifted. Almoft every improvement in 
agriculture is of a late date j for no ground was then fal- 
lowed j no peafe, grafs, turnip, or potatoes, were railed ; 
no cattle were fattened, and little grain was exported. Oats 
and barley were alternately ibwn ; and, during feven months 
in the year, the beft foil was ravaged by flocks of fheep, a 
certain number of which were annually fold, and carried off 
to be fed in richer paftures» 

The inaflivity and indolence of tenants were aftonifliingi 
"When feed-time was finilhed, the plough and harrow were 
laid afide till autumn ; and the fole employment of a farmer 
and his fervants confifted in weeding his corn fields, and in 
digging and conveying home peat, turf, and heath, for win- 
ter fueli The produce of a farm, holding a proportion to 
thofe exsrtionsj was barely fufficient to enable the tenant to 

Vol. I. I T pay 



514 Staiifiical Account 

pay his trifling rent and fervant's wages, and to procure for 
his family a fcanty fubfiftence. 

The rent of an acre of infield was 8— 14 s, ; and of out- 
field 2 — 5^ s. The wages of a male fervant were L. i : lo : o, 
or L. I : 1 5 : o ; of a female, 1 2 — 1 5 s. The price of an horfe 
L. 4 : 6 : o ; of an ox L. 2 ; of a ftieep 5 s.; of a hen 4 d. ; 
of a dozen eggs id. A cart or coup 14353 plough 5 s. ; 
an harrow 6 d. ; and other utenfils of hufbandry nearly in 
the fame proportion to the prefent rates. 

To emancipate the inhabitants of this country from a ftate 
of barbarifm, and to roufe a fpirit of induftry, was a bold and 
arduous enterprife. A gentleman, diftinguiftied by his rank, 
fortune, and public fpirit, undertook and accompliflied the 
talk. With a ^eal and perfeverance becoming an enlighten- 
ed and liberal mind, he formed plans of improvement, Inclo- 
fed farms with proper fences, banifhed fheep from infield 
grounds, combated the prejudices of his tenants, furniflied 
them with marl, diftrlbuted premiums, and otherwife re- 
warded their exertions. The good efFefts of thofe meafures 
foon appeared ; and other proprietors imitated the example. 
In a few years, improvements were diffufed through the 
whole country. I'he tenants, as if awaked out of a profound 
fleep, looked around, beheld his fields clothed with the rich- 
eft harvefts, his herds fattening in luxuriant paftures, his fa- 
mily decked in gay attire, his table loaded with folid fare, 
and wondered at his former ignorance and ftupidity. The 
landlord rejoiced in the fuccefs of his fchemes, and fliared in 
the honours and profits of this new ereftion. The manufac- 
turer, mechanic, and tradefman, redoubled their efforts to 
fupply the increafiqg demand for the conveniencies and ele- 
gancies of lif9.

In this parlfli confiderable improvements have been made, 
but much remains to be effefled. The greater part of it is 
inclofed and fubdivided with hedges and hedge-rows ; but 
two of the proprietors being minors, their tenants have not 
fufiicient encouragement to proceed with vigour. The foil, 
in general, is a fine black mold on a bottom of mortar, and 
yields excellent crops of wheat, barley, oats, turnip, flax, and 
grafs. About eight years ago, the author of this memoir 
procured a few grains of oats of an excellent quality, but un- 
known in this country. During the firft three years he fow- 
ed them in his garden, and afterwards in his glebe. The in- 
creafe has been confiderable ; for laft year, viz. A. D. 1 790, 
there were upwards of 500 bolls of them in the neighbour- 
hood. They are 17 ftones Engliftx per boll, are feveral weeks 
earher than the common oats, and are not liable to be fliaken 
by the wind. There are p farms in this parifli, from L. 50 to 
L. 200 ; about %o from L. 20 to 50 ; the reft are inconfide- 
rable. 

The rent of the infield, /. e. of four-fifths of the whole, is 
15 — 30 s. per acre. The hire of a day labourer is 10 d. or 
1 s. i of a man fervant L. 7 : 9 : o ; of a female L. 3. The 
price of beef, mutton, and pork, 3 ? d. and 4 d. ; of a turkey 
3 s. 6 d. ; of a goofe 2 s, 6 d. ; of a hen 10 d. a dozen eggs 
3 d. } butter 8 d. a pound of 22 ounces; cheefe 5 s, a {lone, 
fame weight. The prices of wheat, oats, barley, «rid meal, 
arc generally regulated by the market at Dundee. Utenfils 
of hufbandry are expenfive. A coup is L. 8 : 10 : o ; a plough 
L. 1:10:©, and L. 2 : 2 : o ; z, harrow 8 s. \ harnefs for two 
horfes L. 2 ; 1 6 : 9, 

ManufaEliires. — ^I'he principal manufadlure in this corner 
is linen. There are 91 weavers in the parifh,who work ever^

Sfaii/tical Accotfnt 



week about 4000 yards, iLe profit arifing from which is L. 25. 
A ftaaip- office wai eiUbiilhed here fevrral years ago. In the 
year 1788, 147,024 yards ot cloth were ftamped at this of- 
fice ; in I7^'9, 150,174 yards ; and in 1790, 136,998 yards. 
The linen manufadtured here is of a fuperior quality, and 
ufed chiefly for buckram, hat linings, &amp;c. 

Poor — In a corner of the country where a fpirit of Induf. 
try pervades every rank, there mufi: be, in proportion, few 
objects of charity. At prefent, there are from fix to eight 
on the poor's lift •, and the neceffities of thefe are relieved 
according to the judgment and difcretion ,of the members of 
feffion. About 50 years a^o, the monthly colleftions for the 
poor were s 9 d, j 30 years ago, they amounted to 14s.; 
and are now L. i : io:o. In the year 1782, the fums re- 
ceived, and thofe diftributed in charity, were nearly equal. 
The public fund is confiderable, and adequate to any exi- 
gence. 

The principal difadvantage under which this parifli and 
the neighbouriiood labour, is their great diftance from pro- 
per fuel. The lower clafs are mdifFerently lupplicd with 
peat or turf from molTes in the vicinity ; and the reft with 
coal from Dundee. The expence of the carriage of coal is 
nearly equal to the original price : But this diladvantage 
might, in a great meafure, be removed by a navigable ca- 
nal. 

Canal. — About 30 years ago, a merchant in this corner, a 
man of uncommon fagacity and enterprife, apprehending the 
utility of a canal through Strathmore, found means to pro- 
cure a furvey of its courfe from Perth towards Forfar, to- 
gether with an eftimate of the expence : But the plan he had 

fonceivetl 



conceived being on too large a fcale, and imorovements and 
manufailures being then in their infancy, the defign was laid 
afide. The utility and pradicablenefs of a canal betweea 
Perth and Forfar will appear from the following remarks : 
I. The whole extent of its courfe would be about 36 miks, 
through a tolerably level and fertile country 2. Its greateft 
elevation, at the eaftern extremity, would not exceed 220 
feet above the level of the f- a. 3. A channel 15 feet broad, 
and 6 deep, with recefles at certain intervals, and 22 locks, 
might be fufficient. 4. From the higher grounds many ri- 
vulets and (niall ftreams defccnd ; and by thele it would be 
amply fupplied with water. 5. The neareft port towns are 
Perth and Dundee, diftant 12 — 18 miles. 6. From thofe 
places, coal, lime, foreign wood, and merchandife, are at 
prefent conveyed by land carriage. And cloth, barley, &amp;c. 
are tranfported thither in the fame way. 7. An extent of 
country, 35 miles long, and 6 broad, coi taiuing upwards of 
20,000 inhabitants, would derive eflcncial benefit from a 
canal Ufeful and prafticable, however, as the plan may ap- 
pear, the lituation of the btrath, with regard to the port towns 
already mentioned, and the expence to be incurred, will, it 
K 'o be feared, for ever prevent fuch an undertaking from 
being carried into execution. For the fum requifite to the 
conflrudion of a canal cannot be eftlmated at lefs thaa 
L. 28,000 or L, 30,000 ; nor the land carriage of 22 pa- 
rifhes in its neighbourhood at more than L. 1100 per an- 
num. A veflel might convey by water 50 tons ; that is, as 
much weight as 125 horfes could carry by land from Perth 
or Dundee. But, unlefs the water carriage were rated at 
7 s. 6 d. per ton, competent intereft could not be had for 
the original fum expended on the canal ; and, if the car- 
riage by water were fo highly rated, the greater part of the 
inhabitants would rather convey their commodities by land.

The moft effectual method of removing this bar would be 
a voluntary contribution of the proprietors, who, in procefs 
of tivney would no doubt be indemnified by an increaie of 
the value of their eftates.
