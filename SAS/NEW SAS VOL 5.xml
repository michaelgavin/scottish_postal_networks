PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ROBERT AULD, D. D. 1 mtjtqtt7T  
THE REV. ALEXANDER CUTHILL, J JJ'- 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Etymology. — Ayr, in all probability, derived its name from the 
river at whose mouth it stands, which appears to have given the 
same designation also to the parish, the bay, and the county. 
But whence was the name itself derived  There are rivers, it is said, 
bearing the same appellative, and having likely the same common 
etymology, in England, France, Switzerland, and in almost every 
country in Europe. In the formation of language, proper names, 
in particular, often take their rise from some quality in the ob- 
jects to which they have become affixed. This has been obvious- 
ly the case in regard to the rivers Ayr and Doon. In Celtic, to 
which the word must undoubtedly be traced, Ar literally signifies 
clear, and Dim or Dhun dark, and those qualities are sufficiently 
characteristic of the streams which they designate. The latter, in 
consequence of running through a soft deep bog near its head, re- 
ceives a black mossy tinge, which it retains during the whole of 
its subsequent course, — whereas the former, from flowing above a 
gravelly bed, continues clear and limpid throughout. The mode 
of spelling the word has undergone several changes in the pro- 
gress of time. In the royal charter of the burgh, and in all an- 
cient records, it is written, Are ; from this it came to be changed 
into Air and since the end of the last century, Ayr has very ge- 
nerally been adopted, and is likely now to be permanent. 

Topography. — The town is situated in nearly the middle of a line 
of sea coast, about seven miles in length, forming in a gentle curve 
the inner basin of the beautiful bay of Ayr, and the western bound- 
ary of a fertile and finely cultivated valley, which is almost entire- 
ly of a level surface, extending inland about four or five miles from 
the beach. Beyond this, the ground begins to rise by a gentle 
slope to the height of two or three hundred feet, inclosing the vale 
by a finely marked amphitheatre of hills, and terminating on the

south-west, in the somewhat bolder and higlier range of Brown Car- 
rick, which projects- into the sea in two or three precipitous rocky 
capes called the Heads of Ayr. In hardly any part of this ascend- 
ing boundary, is the swell so abrupt as to render the soil inca- 
pable of cultivation, and- every part of it is under tillage, with the 
exception of what is occupied by plantations, and some small 
patches on the brow of Carrick hill, which are better suited for 
pasture. The valley which is thus surrounded consists of the pa- 
rishes of Ayr, Monkton, and St Quivox, together with a small 
part of the parish of Maybole, and forms a district of country, 
which, for richness of soil and cultivation, and finely wooded and 
diversified scenery, is hardly equalled by any other in the county. 
The river Ayr runs through nearly the middle of this beautiful 
strath, and its banks for several miles are very picturesque, and 
finely variegated and adorned by the plantations and pleasure- 
grounds of Craigie and Auchencruive. Scarcely any part of it 
is barren, except a small extent of sand hillocks, in the neigh- 
bourhood of Prestvvick, and it too is fast disappearing in the pro- 
gress of improvement. Not many years ago, the Glasgow road, 
for upwards of three miles in the vicinity of Ayr, ran on both sides, 
through accumulated wreaths of barren sand, which gave the tra- 
veller a very unfavourable impression of the approach to the county 
town. Now, however, nearly all this has vanished from the sight, 
and the eye is gratified with small well-cultivated inclosures, neat 
jcottages and gardens, and handsome villas with ornamented ave- 
nues and shrubberies. 

Boundaries. — Of this valley which has now been described, the 
parish of Ayr forms a conspicuous portion, to the extent of more 
than one-third part of its surface. It is bounded on the north by 
the Water of Ayr, which divides it from St Quivox ; on the east by 
Coylton ; on the south by Dalrymple ; on the south-west by the 
river Doon, and on the west by the sea. It extends betwixt 5 and 
6 miles on its south-eastern boundary, about 3 miles aloT\g the 
river Ayr to the north, four miles along the Doon to the south, 
having two miles of sea coast on the west, and about 4 miles of 
extent from the town to its most distant limit. It consists of the 
united parishes of Ayr and AUoway, which are nearly equal in 
point of extent of surface, a small rivulet called Glengaw burn 
forming the boundary betwixt them. They were united about 
the end of the seventeenth century, and both are put on the same 



AYR.

footing as to clerical superintendence. The two contain about 
5000 acres. 

Soil and Surface.— To a short distance along the margin of the 
sea, the soil is light and sandy, though almost the whole of it is 
under cultivation. It bears tolerably fair crops, unless in very dry 
seasons, and from the care that is taken in enriching it every year 
with manure and sea weed, it is improving progressively into an 
earthy vegetable consistence. Beyond this, the land for nearly 
two miles of breadth inland is rich and fertile, but, chiefly by 
means of vegetable mixtures, on a sandy surface ; it is kindly in its 
nature and easily worked, and capable of bearing luxuriant crops 
of all sorts of grain and culinary herbs. A considerable part of 
it is under thriving plantations, which, by the shelter they afford, 
add much to its fertility and productiveness. About two miles and 
a-half inland from the coast, the soil becomes less free and gener- 
ous, in proportion as the ground begins to ascend, until it dege- 
nerates into a cold stiff clay, or till, in the upper part of the parish, 
yielding but indifferent crops, and being equally unfavourable for 
pasture. The whole parish, however, is in a state of tillage, with 
the exception of the Fort- Green belonging to the Marquis of Ailsa, 
a small inclosure behind Wellington Square, called the Low Green, 
and the race course, all of which are generally kept in pasture, 
though also capable of cultivation. The race-course consists of 
80 or 90 acres, inclosed with a stone wall, and was formerly a 
common, free to every burgess for feeding cows. It is now held as 
the property of the burgh, and let by public roup annually to the 
highest bidder ; but when or how the burgesses came to lose their 
right of commonage cannot well be ascertained. It must have been 
within the last forty years, as it is stated to have been a common 
at the date of the last Statistical Account of Ayr ; and its having 
ceased to be so, must doubtless have been with the consent, ex- 
pressed or implied, of those having right to it. 

External Appearance. — In the upper part of the parish, the land 
is cold and bleak, and very tame in point of scenery. A few belts 
of plantation would greatly improve it, both as regards shelter and 
ornament ; and that trees are capable of thriving, even in the most 
exposed situations, is evident from the fir clumps that surround the 
farms of Pleasantfield, Abbeyhill, Cockhill, and Bellsbank. Most 
of the fields in this high ground are subdivided by thorn hedges, 
and where thorns will grow, the more hardy forest trees would also 
thrive. Descending a little lower down, there is no want of wood

in any direction, and the plantations that abound are finely diversi- 
fied with the stately mansions and pleasure grounds of landed pro- 
prietors, which tend greatly to improve the scenery and aspect of 
the parish. The district in the immediate vicinity of Ayr is beau- 
tifully ornamented in this way, and the fields that are not under 
wood are cultivated and dressed like a garden. In the old parish 
fronting the town, the mansion house of Castlehill belonging to 
James Ballantyne, Esq. stands pre-eminently distinguished. It 
is situated on a commanding eminence, surrounded with fine plan- 
tations, and has a most interesting view of Ayr, its harbour and 
bay, and the distant mountains of Arran. A little to the west of 
it is the secluded retreat of Belmont Cottage nearly hid among the 
trees in which it is embowered. A little further on, towards AUo- 
way, is the magnificent seat of Rozelle, with its stately woods and en- 
closures, the residence of Archibald Hamilton, Esq., and Lady Jane 
M. Hamilton, daughter of the late and aunt of the present Earl 
of Eglinton, to whom the property belongs. To the south, at a 
short distance, lies the beautiful domain of Doonholm, stretching 
along the banks of the Doon, and having its mansion-house almost 
entirely concealed by thick groves of thriving plantations. To the 
west, nearer the sea, is the House of Belle-isle, the residence of 
the late Alexander West Hamilton, Esq. of Pinmore, who al- 
most rebuilt it, by constructing a spacious edifice around the walls 
of the old mansion, on one of the most enviable sites in the parish. 
It is now the pi'operty of his son Hugh, a minor, and rears its tur- 
reted gable, projections, and chimney tops above the trees, in the 
style of the old English baronial manor-houses. And in its imme- 
diate vicinity, is the elegant new mansion of Mount Charles, stand- 
ing on a steep bank above the Doon, with a beautiful lawn in 
front, and shaded all around with groves of plantations. When 
the parish of AUoway was united to that of Ayr, so bleak and bar- 
ren was its surface, that it was covered almost entirely with furze 
and heath, without shelter or ornament of any kind, except some 
natural wood along the banks of the river. It is on record, that 
" the lands were possessed by tenants, at the yearly rent of Is. Sd. 
per acre, which they were luiable to pay, and often became bank- 
rupts and beggars." At present, a great part of it is among the most 
fertile, the best cultivated, and the most finely wooded districts 
in the county, the land yielding a rent of upwards of L. 4 an acre, 
and producing in crops a fair remunerating return to the farmer. 
Climate. — The climate at Ayr, although variable and moist, is 

3 



AYR. 



5 



comparatively genial and salubnous, and the inhabitants in gene- 
ral are healthy and long-lived. The place, indeed, has been re- 
marked for longevity, and, as a proof that it is a consequence of 
the weather, it exists to a greater extent among those individuals 
who have remained stationary in the parish, several of whom are 
betwixt ninety and a hundred years old. The quantity of rain which 
falls is more than an average, but the open and porous sandy sub- 
soil allows the surplus moisture to filter through quickly, which of 
course leaves the surface at all times fit for labour and recreation 
in the open air, in fair weather. The footpaths and promenades 
near the town are generally dry and pleasant ; and exercise in walk- 
ing, to which the people are much addicted, combined with the 
bracing influence of the sea-breeze, contributes much to their ge- 
neral health and strength, and to promote exhilaration and equa- 
nimity of spirits. The temperature of the atmosphere is pretty 
uniform, the proximity of the sea serving to moderate its depres- 
sion in winter, and its elevation in summer. The thermometer is 
seldom below the freezing point, and never for any long continu- 
ance. Snow rarely lies for any length of time on the ground, and 
often, when it is very deep in the inland districts, it is found here 
hardly to cover the surface. The equality of the temperature may 
also depend in some degree on the flatness and dryness of the 
land, its high state of cultivation, the almost universal draining to 
which it is subjected, and the want of extensive woods to attract 
and retain moisture. The prevailing winds are the south and west, 
and those coming from the Atlantic are mild and moist, and never 
so injurious to health as the dry bitter eastern and northern gales. 
There are not any endemic diseases peculiar to the locality. The 
most obnoxious are catarrhal and rheumatic complaints, owing to 
the variableness of the climate in regard to moisture. Fever pre- 
vails among the destitute and poor, and sometimes to a very fatal 
extent. Pulmonary or consumptive disease is not generally severe, 
and is attended with symptoms that show it to be more owing to 
hereditary taint than external causes. Diseases of the glands are 
not unfrequent, but they are generally mild when judiciously treat- 
ed. Asthma is often met with, but it is rarely fatal. It is com- 
monly supposed that the climate here is unfavourable to it, and 
also to consumptive complaints, but on inquiry, it does not appear 
that medical practitioners are disposed generally to favour this opi- 
nion. 

Hydrography, Springs. — Ayr abounds in springs every where, and 



6 



AYRSHIRE. 



they can easily be reached not far below the surface of the earth. 
The spring water, however, is generally hard, and particularly in 
the town. It is very unfit for detergent and certain culinary purposes. 
It holds in solution carbonates of lime and magnesia, sulphates of 
lime and magnesia, and chlorides of lime, magnesia, and soda, but 
the salt most predominant is carbonate of lime. Traces of iron in 
combination, or as an oxide, are generally to be found, although in 
some wells they cannot be detected. It is obvious, that, however hard 
the water may be from these saline matters which it holds in solu- 
tion, it is not deleterious or hurtful, as, from their laxative nature, 
when iron is in solution, it is rather tonic and corroborative to 
the system than injurious to it. A plan has been for some time 
in agitation for bringing an adequate supply of pure spring water 
in pipes from Carrick-hill, for the use of the inhabitants. This 
plan has now been matured, and the money necessary for the un- 
dertaking subscribed ; and a bill is about to be brought into Par- 
liament immediately to give it effect, so that the town is hkely ere 
long to have in abundance, and in its purest state, one of the most 
indispensable and beneficial elements of life. 

Lakes. — There are two small lochs in the country part of the 
parish, one towards the south, and the other on the eastern bound- 
ary ; but neither of them is of much extent or importance. The 
one to the east is the larger of the two, but it does not exceed a 
mile in circumference. It is called Loch Fergus, and is mention- 
ed in the charters of the burgh, upwards of 600 years ago, as one 
of the limits of the regium donum of territorial property, made 
over to the burgh of Ayr. It has a small island in the middle, 
and abounds in pike, but in few, if any other fish, as this shark of 
the fresh waters is too voracious a tyrant to allow any of the small- 
er finny tribes to exist in the same element in its neighbourhood. 
There were, it is said, till lately, the remains of an old ruined castle 
near its margin, which probably was used as a shooting station by 
the Cassillis family, to whom the property belongs. The ma- 
terials have been used in building and repairing farm steadings and 
dikes in the vicinity. Herons, wild ducks, and other erratic fowls, 
occasionally frequent it, and its situation is sufficiently wild and 
lonely to encourage them. 

Rivei' Ayr. — This river takes its rise in the eastern extremity 

 Since the above was wiilteii, we have learned that Ibis plan has Ijecii in the 
incanlime dcteintccl, iii consequence of some disagreement as lo terms, on lie part of 
the Marquis of Ailsa, the proprietor of the springs.

of the county, about thirty miles from its influx into the sea, and 
it runs through the whole breadth of the shire, to which in this 
view it appropriately gives its ■name, dividing it into two nearly equal 
parts. Along the upper part of its course, the scenery is naked 
and uninteresting, as it flows through a moorland mountainous 
country, covered with extensive sheep-walks, almost entirely bare 
of wood, and with hardly any banks above the heaths and meadows 
that surround it. After it reaches the village of Sorn, however, 
the scenery becomes exceedingly grand and picturesque, and con- 
tinues so all the way to its mouth. In fact, for nearly twenty miles, 
few streams can excel it for richness and variety of landscape. It 
exhibits the sublime and beautiful in nature's works, in endless 
succession, and in every possible variety of combination, while at 
the same time it receives ample assistance from the ornaments 
of art, in the numerous magnificent mansions and pleasure grounds 
which adorn its borders, seeking from it in return, variety, beauty, 
and fertility. It is subject at times to sudden and impetuous 
floods, during which it carries down great quantities of alluvial mat- 
ter, which it deposits at its mouth, thereby forming a bar, which is 
a great obstruction to the entrance and egress of vessels, and a 
formidable drawback to the harbour of Ayr, as an emporium of 
trade. At a short distance above the harbour are " the Twa Brigs" 
rendered famous by the humorous poem of Burns, which bears 
that title. The new bridge is a handsome structure, and well 
placed, and convenient enough for the use of the public, though 
rather too narrow. The other is entirely shut up, except to foot-' 
passengers. 

River Doon. — This classic stream, which forms the south-western 
boundary of the parish, rises out of a lake of the same name, about 
eighteen miles inland to the south-east of Ayr, bounded by high 
mountains, and situated on the confines betwixt Ayrshire and the 
stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The lake from which it claims its 
paternity is exceedingly picturesque, from the elevated mountain 
ridges with which it is surrounded, and were these covered with 
wood, instead of being naked moorland pasture, they might vie with 
the lake scenery of Cumberland. In issuing from this interesting 
sheet of water, the river formerly ran over the top of a narrow 
edging of rock, about 15 or 20 feet above the bed of the streani 
below. But as the lake was found to be nearly of the same depth 
on the other side, two. mines have been cut through the rock 
through which the water has been brought, and two sluices pla- 



8

ced at their mouths, which maintain the complete command of the 
current. This work was effected with the view of recovering a 
considerable extent of ground around the lake, by diminishing the 
depth and extent of its water. The effect contemplated has no 
doubt been accomplished, in one view, by the diminution of the 
surface of water to the extent of nearly one-half, but little advan- 
tage has been gained, in consequence of the land recovered being 
entirely useless by its channelly surface, while the lake has been 
greatly injured in point of beauty and extent. It is still, however, 
much frequented in fishing excursions. The Doon on its egress' 
as above described, runs for nearly a mile through a rocky precipi- 
tous chasm, overhung with trees and brushwood, along the bottom 
of which a romantic sequestered walk has been cut for foot-pas- 
sengers, where the rocks on both sides are so perpendicular and 
rugged to a great height, as almost to exclude the light of the sun, 
and to form a scene exceedingly sublime and striking. The 
scenery on its banks below Dalmellington is very tame, as the 
river runs for several miles through a flat bog and meadow, with 
hardly any declination of surface, and nothing to give interest or 
variety to its banks. When it reaches Skeldon, however, it as- 
sumes a very picturesque appearance, its banks rising in promi- 
nency, and being well covered with wood ; and these features it pre- 
serves till it mingles its waters with the sea, two miles to the west 
of Ayr. 

The Sea-Beach — Change in the Course of the Doon—T\\e coast to 
the same extent is much frequented by the inhabitants of the town 
for air and exercise, and the walk along the sands is always in- 
teresting, on account of the healthful breeze from the waters, and 
the never-faihng attractiveness of a sea view. The extent of coast, 
however, within the parish, must have been more confined at one 
time than it is at present, as the Doon seems to have joined the 
sea much nearer the town than it does by its present course. This 
suggests a topic of considerable interest and curiosity ; but we have 
little to aid us, not even tradition, in our inquiries respecting it. 
There seems to be little reason to doubt, that formerly the river 
had a different bed at the lower extremity of the parish from what 
it now retains, and the alteration appears to have taken place im- 
mediately below the lower bridge. There are obvious indications 
that, at or under this point, it ran along nearly the line of the present 
road by the south of Gowkscraft nursery, and the eastern boundary 
of the farm of Cunning Park, — that it diverged to the west of Sea- 



AYR.

field House and the fields of Blackburn, — and that it joined the 
sea at, or not far from, the present mouth of the Water of Ayr. 
It is not easy to determine when or how the change into its pre- 
sent channel took place ; whether it was by the unaided workings 
of nature, or by artificial means, for the sake of the ground that 
would be recovered by a less circuitous course. The latter con- 
sideration was likely to present a motive sufficiently adequate for 
the undertaking, since, by means of the change, a valuable extent 
of ground has been gained from the sea, which, quoad civilia, 
still is attached to Maybole parish, affording an indubitable evi- 
dence that it once belonged to it, without the river intervening as 
at present to separate them. The receding of the sea, no doubt, 
may also have aided in effecting the change. There are indica- 
tions which can easily be traced of the former bed of the river, all 
the way from the new bridge near Belle-isle gate house to the 
head of the Low Green, a line of low marshy ground running along 
the whole way, except where it has lately been filled up and cul- 
tivated on the Blackburn property. The only difficulty that oc- 
curs is to account for the raised up bank at and below the Low 
Bridge of Doon, which is several feet above the level of the stream. 
If the course was changed, however, by artificial means, the same 
means would be used to keep it from getting into its former chan- 
nel, by the fence of an elevated forced embankment, which the 
rising ground here above the river evidently is, from the declivity 
that takes place on the Ayr road immediately after passing the 
bridge. But we can produce something more than mere conjec- 
ture on this subject. A few years ago a very handsome bell of 
considerable dimensions, with the words Gloria Soli Doe for Zeo 
marked upon it in large letters, was found in the marshy grounds 
behind Blackburn House, which we have supposed to have been 
the bed of the river, together with some spars of a vessel that 
seems to have been stranded or sunk near its mouth. From this 
it would appear to have been navigable like the Ayr for some short 
distance above its confluence with the sea. Blackburn itself is sy- 
nonymous with the Doon river. 

The Bay of Ayr is by far the finest feature of the scenery con- 
nected with the town and parish, and in that view merits a parti- 
cular description. It is formed by the junction of the Frith of 
Clyde, with the waters of the Atlantic. On all sides it appears 
bounded by prominent outlines of land scenery, except towards 
the west, whence in a clear day the distant coast of Ireland is dim-

ly seen in the horizon peering above the wide expanse of ocean 
which surrounds it. Nearer in the same direction, the view is also 
reheved by the very prominent Craig of Ailsa, by far the most re- 
markable object on the coast of Ayrshire. It.rises to the height of 
about a thousand feet above the level of the sea, and is two 
miles in circumference at its base. To a great distance, both at 
sea and on land, it is seen towering its majestic conical peak in so- 
litary grandeur, being nearly perpendicular on all sides, and con- 
sisting of a stupendous bare rock of the trap formation, on which 
there is hardly any vegetation, and no signs of life, with the ex- 
ception of numerous flocks of gannets or solan geese, and other 
sea fowls. The beholder is struck with awe at its prominent and 
precipitous appearance, and wonders how such an object could 
have been produced in so solitary a situation, amid the deep wa- 
ters of the open sea, without anything to correspond with it in any 
direction. It generally appears to the eye from afar shrouded in 
light blue mist, unless when it assumes a more sombre veil amid 
fogs, and rain, and tempest. 

On one side, the bay is bounded by the coast of Ayrshire, com- 
mencing at the promontory of Carrick hill, and inclining inwards in 
a concave form, like a bow upon the stretch. At its termination to- 
wards the north, are seen the islands of Cumbraes and the Bute 
hills, which appear almost contiguous, the inlet of Clyde being 
hardly perceptible from a distance, and behind these are the pro- 
minent mountains of Argyleshire. There is also to be seen in the 
distance towards the north the majestic summit of Benlomond, re- 
calling to mind the beautiful lake at its base ; and the country of 
the Macgregor, abounding in savage grandeur,— scenes rendered 
deeply interesting by the magic pen of Sir Walter Scott, But its 
most marked boundary by far is the island of Arran, with its lofty 
mountains stretching along nearly the whole of its coast to the 
north and west, with the projection from behind of the Mull of 
Cantyre. These mountains communicate to it its principal in- 
terest and grandeur, and, according to the state of the weather, it 
derives from them an endless succession of noble appearances, with 
which the view of the beholder is constantly relieved and capti- 
vated. Sometimes they are bright with sunshine and gladsome se- 
renity, at others dark and frowning amid clouds and storms. In 
summer, they are seen with hazy shadows flitting across their 
ridges, or are beat upon with an incessant glare of solar heat and 
radiance ; while in winter they seem grand and imposing in the ex-

treme, with a thick covering of snow, glittering in dazzling white- 
ness from afar, and with dark or fleecy clouds passing in endless 
succession over their lofty summits. But the sublimest and most 
pleasing aspect which they assume is when the sun has "just sunk 
beneath the western wave" in a calm clear evening, throwing his 
golden beams over their majestic ridges, so finely and distinctly 
marked in the serene azure sky, while all other objects underneath 
have already been thrown into the soft and dusky shade of twi- 
light. 

Where Arran terminates, the projecting point of Cantyre pro- 
longs the boundary of the bay considerably further to the west, 
so that with this apparent contiguity of land all around, except at 
one point, and that point only seen in one line of view, it looks 
like a lake of very large dimensions, diversified everywhere along 
its borders with the most beautiful and striking features. With 
the exception of the Bay of Naples, there is hardly any thing per- 
haps of the kind that can rival it in extent, taken in conjunction 
with its beauty, grandeur, and attractiveness. The Bay of Dub- 
lin is both inferior in point of size, and tamer in prominent and 
magnificent outline. The Wicklow mountains no doubt have a 
wild grandeur about them, but they form not the fine marginal 
variety that the mountains of Arran and Argyleshire, and the 
other scenery around, give to the Bay of Ayr, which is an object 
of admiration to all strangers, and of delight to all who live up- 
on its borders. Along the far projecting coast of Cunningham, 
to the north-east, may be seen in a clear day, glittering in the 
sunshine, the thriving towns of Ardrossan, Stevenston, Saltcoats, 
Kilwinning, and Irvine, which give interest and variety to the 
scene, and convey the idea of a district teeming with animation, 
wealth, and industry. The town of Ayr stands in its south cor- 
ner, and derives from it principally its healthiness, as well as its 
enviableness of situation. Its waters present a never-ending va- 
riety to the view, and every new aspect which they assume, exhi- 
bits different phases of interest, to all who admire the grand and 
beautiful in natural scenery. 

Geology. — The parish of Ayr, having something of a peninsu- 
lar form, by the boundaries of the Ayr and Doon and the sea, on 
three of its sides, — is greatly modified by this position in its geo- 
logical character. Though undulating in its surface, it may ge- 
nerally be described as sloping gradually towards the rivers on 
the north and south, and the sea on the west, the inland part ris- 



12 



AYRSHIRK 



ing into elevations of considerable height. The portion lying ad- 
jacent to the coast, and extending from the one stream to the 
other, IS nearly one continued level. This last section of the pa- 
rish IS composed of sand and gravel, when we descend to any 
depth below the immediate surface, which, through the influence 
of cultivation, has, in the course of time, been changed from its 
natural state. Along the line where this flat surface begins to 
rise into elevated acclivities, a very considerable depth of moss 
earth IS very generally found, and in some places, where excava- 
t.ons have been made, singular alternations of this moss earth with 
fine sand have been disclosed. These substances are in this case 
found in regular strata, evidently formed by water. The surface 
on the elevated portions of the parish, on the other hand, is com- 
posed chiefly of clay mixed with water-rounded stones of the trap 
or whinstone species. In general, therefore, the parish may be 
described as presenting a superficial district of no definite geo- 
logical character, the external surface being covered with a dilu- 
vium, or broken mass of sand, gravel, and clay, intermixed with 
the water-worn detached whinstones already mentioned. 

This covering of disintegrated materials hides completely the 
rocks on which it lies ; and hence it is only by analogy— by com- 
paring certain portions with the neighbouring strata, which are 
known, that its structure can be ascertained. When the rocks 
in their original bed are seen, either along the course of the 
rivers, or in opening quarries, or digging for coal, they are 
found to belong principally to the trap or whinstone species, like 
the boulders on the surface. Along the course of the Ayr, indeed, 
a coarse red-coloured sandstone appears, but in other parts the trap 
prevails. The uppermost geological character of the whole parish 
thus evidently belongs to the coal formation. This useful mineral, 
however, which forms the great source of subterranean wealth in 
the neighbouring districts, has tended but little to enrich the pro- 
prietors in this parish. Here coal has been worked only for a 
few hundred yards within its northern boundary. Indeed it may 
be said that, except in its very extremity, at the embouchure of 
the river Ayr, no minings for coal have succeeded. Even here the 
workings are supposed to be exhausted, and after having been tra- 
ced for a short distance southward, the veins have ended or dis- 
appeared, and the works have been discontinued. The seam is 
about three feet eight inches in thickness, and the quality is of the 
kind called splint coal, the same bed apparently that has been for 



AYR. 



13 



many years, and still is, worked to a great extent in the parishes of 
Newton and St Quivox, on the opposite side of the river. 

From this position of the coal-field, we are enabled to ascertain 
the direction of the strata, or slope of lower geological formation 
of the parish. These strata rise by a gradual ascent towards the 
southern boundary, which is formed by the Doon, immediately be- 
yond which begins the range of Carrick hill. But in the stratifi- 
cation, some remarkable phenomena have been discovered in 
searching for or working coal. It has been already noticed, that 
trap or whinstone forms the main body of the rock throughout 
the parish, but it is here more diversified than usually occurs in 
coal districts. In the coal formation, dikes, or vertical detached 
strata are common, and, as is well known, present the most for- 
midable and annoying obstruction to the operations of the miner. 
In Ayr parish, basalt trap occurs not only in these perpendicular 
walls, cutting through or deranging the coal seams, but also sends 
out protrusions and ramifications on all sides, and at various angles 
of inclination. These branches or streams, for the whole appears 
as if it had been once fluid, have penetrated between the other 
solid strata, destroying thus the seams of coal. This is doubtless 
the cause why these seams, which in the neighbouring parishes to 
the north of the Ayr are wrought to so much advantage, are un- 
productive here. One seam of coal, which would otherwise be 
valuable, is known to be overlaid by one of these horizontal beds 
of trap, to the thickness of twenty -four feet. 

, Mineralogy. — The mineralogy in this parish is not of much im- 
portance. There are no metals to be found, nor metalliferous 
ores, which deserve particular notice. Along the shore, some fine 
specimens of agate are occasionally met with : and in the bed of 
the Ayr is procured the peculiar species of clay-stone, with mi- 
nute grains of dark felspar and mica, so well known over the 
country by the name of Water of Ayr stone, and used so general- 
ly as a whetstone for fine-edged tools, and for polishing marble and 
metals. The organic remains which have been discovered occur 
chiefly in the dark shale which accompanies the freestone and coal 
formation. These consist of beautiful impressions of ferns, and 
trunks, and branches of trees, imbedded in the masses of the'stra- 
ta. A freestone quarry was formerly worked near the town, but 
it is now abandoned, and supplies of stone for building have to be 
brought from the neighbouring parishes. The stone, besides, was 
so far under the surface, that the working was expensive.

Zooloff -T\ns parish is not remarkable for any rare animals. 
Foxes are found m some of the coverts, and are numerous in several 
of the neighbourmg parishes. They are rather encouraged than 
otherwise by the gentlemen sportsmen of the country,— two packs 
of fox-hounds being stationed in this vicinity during a considerable 
part of the year. Otters are occasionally seen in the Boon and 
Ayr, or the lakes and streams connected with these rivers, and the 
common seal frequents the sea-coast, though neither are sought 
after either for sport or utility. Hares, rabbits, pheasants, and 
partridges, although not so numerous as formerly, are still com- 
mon, and we have been informed that quails at one time were 
abundant. Now, however, if not altogether extinct, they are very 
rarely to be met with. Woodcocks, snipes, land and water-rails, and 
green and golden plover, are also common in their seasons, together 
with several varieties of sandpipers along the beach. The soli- 
tary bittern has sometimes been found, and his congener the heron 
may be often seen in the small brooks, with his head overtoppino- 
the rushes like a sentinel watching for his prey. The kingsfisher 
and water-ouzel are also found on the streams, and several of the 
smaller description of hawks and owls, including the goatsucker and " 
fern-owl. Fieldfares and snowflakes are to be met with during seve- 
ral of the winter months. The starling is a rare bird, but not alto- 
gether unknown here. The same variety of birds, both indigenous 
and migratory, which is common to the country, is as abund- 
ant in this vicinity as elsewhere. In severe weather, wild swan, 
geese, ducks, and also barnacle, are sometimes seen on the coast 
and widgeon and teal of several varieties, are then also very com- 
mon. Sea-gulls, divers, and, in short, sea-fowl of every kind are 
numerous on our shores, and, during the spring months, the gan- 
net or solan-goose, from the rocky summit of Ailsa, its usual haunt 
and breeding-place, is not unfrequently seen, sweeping along the 
coast, descending occasionally like an arrow on its prey. 

The Boon and the Ayr have been long celebrated for their sal- 
mon-fishings. The former is probably one of the earliest rivers in 
this respect in Scotland. It is generally believed that at no time is it 
destitute of salmon in a clean marketable condition. Before the 
passing of the late act, extending the close time to the Jst of Feb- 
ruary, they were commonly taken as early as Christmas, and dur-

the locality, yet they may he noticed here, as this may perhaps be the only parish 
on the western coast, where they will he found in combination.

ing the month of January, a great number of excellent fish were 
annually caught. It is somewhat singular, that while the Doon 
is so early, the Ayr, situated within so short a distance from it, like 
the other rivers in Ayrshire, is unusually late, very few fish being 
caught there before the beginning of June. At one time, this fish 
was so abundant that it not only formed a chief part of the food 
of the inhabitants, but was exported in large quantities, from Ayr 
to France, in exchange for wine and other produce of that country. 
Now, however, the number taken is comparatively small, particu- 
larly in the river Ayr, where the fishing is nearly destroyed. The 
cause of the decrease of the salmon may, in a great degree, be at- 
tributed to the erection of a high dam-dike in the Ayr, near its 
mouth, over which the fish have great difficulty in ascending. A most 
objectionable dike also exists in the Doon, at AUoway mill, attend- 
ed with similar results, though not to so great an extent. The 
consequence of these impediments is, that the fish are at all times 
obstructed in their free passage up the streams to spawn, and dur- 
ing the fishing-season, detained and taken by the fishermen. The 
other causes are, the extensive hming of the lands, steeping of lint, 
the introduction of manufactures on the banks, the destruction of 
the salmon by poachers when in the act of spawning, and the va- 
rious stake-nets and other devices, now resorted to for theircapture, 
In the Doon, however, and along the coast in the vicinity of its 
mouth, numbers continue to be taken, — more than enough to sup- 
ply Ayr market ; and the surplus finds a ready sale in larger towns 
at a distance. 

Although the inclination of the salmon seems to impel them to 
ascend the streams at all periods of the summer, when there is 
sufficient water, yet the months in which they chiefly resort thither 
are August, September, and October. According as they are in 
an advanced or a late stage of breeding, they soon afterwards de- 
posit their spawn, and return to the sea during the months of 
January, February, March, and April. But in the Doon, salmon 
 on the eve of spawning have been found not only early in the 
autumn, but as late as March and April, which may account for 
that river's being so early in producing clean fish, compared with 
other streams. Besides the common river trout during the summer 
months, more particularly in the Doon, excellent sea trout ace taken 
in considerable quantities. The lamprey is occasionally found in 
both rivers, but never used as an article of food ; and that mysterious 
little fish, the par, is likewise common to both. Much discussion,.

AYRSHIRE. 



it is well known, has arisen as to whether the par be the young of 
the salmon, or a distinct species by itself. 

Botany,— Forest Trees.— Va. the immediate vicinity of the sea, it 
is difficult, or perhaps in some cases imposiible, to get forest trees 
to thrive, as the sea air has a blasting influence on most of them. 
There are some, however, which it does not much aflfect, such as wil- 
lows and poplars, and both of these sometimes grow to a great size, 
when all other kinds become dwarfish and stunted. Those, there- 
fore, who prefer fixing their residence near the beach, and at the 
same time court the ornament and shelter of plantations, can only 
hope to have their wishes gratified in this respect, by planting 
closely at first, and thinning out afterwards, as the trees advance 
in size ; and more particularly by forming an edging of the hardy 
plants above-mentioned, for protection on the sides most exposed 
to the obnoxious sea-breezes. By following this mode, a great 
many clumps of wooded enclosures have been reared, beside 
mansions and villas that fringe the coast to the west of the town, 
which tend much to adorn its environs, and contribute both to 
the shelter and fertility of the grounds over which they are in- 
terspersed. A little more inland, trees are found to thrive with 
great luxuriance, as the plantations which surround Belle-isle, Ro- 
zelle, and Mount Charles will bear ample testimony. In these, 
are to be seen as tall and handsomely formed beeches as can be 
met with anywhere else perhaps in the county. Though a con- 
siderable part of the parish is well wooded, yet there are no woods 
in it of any great extent. They consist of small belts or clumps 
intersecting or inclosing cultivated fields, and surrounding gardens 
and pleasure grounds in the vicinity of gentlemen's seats. None 
of the landed proprietors think of cultivating timber for profit or 
sale, but only for shelter and ornament, and hence it would not be 
easy to ascertain what extent of the surface of the parish alto- 
gether is under wood. The ground which it occupies, however, 
must be considerable. 

Shrubs and Plants. — With respect to shrubs there are some pecu- 
liarly fine and thriving ones, resembling small bushy trees, to be seen 
in the domains we have already mentioned, and also about Doon- 
holm, Castlehill, and Burns's monument. At the last named place, 
there is no person who has a taste for horticulture but must be gra- 
tified with the richness and luxuriance of the collection, and thetnste 
with which they are dressed and set out. We are not aware of any 
plants thatare peculiarto the parish, with theexception of the follow-

ing one, which has been pointed out to us by an inteUigent practical 
gardener in this neighbourhood, who has paid great attention to the 
study of botany. We shall give the account of it in his own words : 
' A few years ago there was found on the farm of Cockhill, about 
three miles south-east from Ayr, a very fine species of Ononis. Tn 
its general appearance it approaches near to spinosa. The root is 
stationary, which distinguishes it from the Ononis arvensis. The 
stems rise about two feet high, are very spiny, and covered in sum- 
mer with a profusion of red-coloured blossoms of a very handsome 
sppearance. This plant has been sent to various quarters of Britain, 
and is known in gardens under the name of Ononis spinosissima. It 
has not been found anywhere else, nor has it as yet been described in 
any botanical work." Another botanical friend has informed us, that 
he once found a very fine specimen of the CEnothera biennis, in a state 
of nature, among some solitary sand-hills, far from any garden whence 
its seeds could have escaped. He supposes the seed to have been 
blown to that spot, from some timber ships from America, as it is un- 
certain whether it has ever been found before in Scotland, in a wild 
state. What will be reckoned interesting to botanists in regard to the 
temperature of this place, is the fact, that in the garden of Mount 
Charles, the Acacia dealbata, and the Benthamia fragifera, the for- 
mer on a wall, the latter in a border, have stood the last winter 
without any covering, and without having received the smallest in- 
jury. Though there are no plants that are peculiar to the parish, 
with the exception above described, yet there are some that are 
rarely found anywhere else. For instance, the Brassica Monensis, 
or Isle of Man cabbage, grows in great abundance along the sea 
coast in the vicinity of the town, and though it is to be found in 
Bute and Arran, yet it is seldom or never met with on the main- 
land. The Convolvulus soldanella has been picked up once or twice 
on the sands, but it grows with great luxuriance on the shores 
of a neighbouring parish. It has been remarked, that plants ac- 
quire a greater brilliancy of colouring here than in most other 
places of Scotland, probably owing to the arid nature of the soil • 
certamly very handsome specimens may be obtained. The most 
numerous classes are the Vicia, Trifolia and Gramina, and it might 
perhaps be of advantage to the stock-farmer to be at pains to im- 
prove the two former in his pastures and sheep walks. From the 
proximity to the sea shore, there are some plants that are indigenous 
in this parish, and by no means common in many parts of Scotland 
Among others we may mention the following :

IT. — Civil History. 
Ayr Town. — The town of Ayr is seen to great advantage from 
any part of the rising grounds, from which the traveller must ap- 
proach it on almost every road that communicates with the inte- 
rior. It stands on a broad level plain, and can be seen at the dis- 
tance of several miles in all directions. But by far the most fa- 
vourable view of it is that from the south in the direction of Car- 
rick Hill, which commands one of the finest prospects to be met 
with anywhere, and the town forms none of the least attractive 
points in the landscape. Here it seems a very striking object,— 
the handsome new buildings on the side of Wellington Square and 
Barns' Street, first appearing to the eye, shaded by the plantations 
that adorn the numerous villas that intervene in the suburbs. The 
old part of Ayr is almost hid in the back ground, unless in so far 
as the irregular tops of the chimneys and gable ends peer above, 
or are seen through some open space, giving it a turreted sort of 
aspect, and conveying an impression of greater extent than in rea- 
lity belongs to it. The county buildings, the lofty tapering new 
spire, and the imposing Gothic-like erection of Wallace Tower, 
have tended much to beautify and adorn the town, and to add to 
the effect of its appearance, when seen from a distance. When 
Ayr is spoken of generally, the name is made to comprehend the 
congregated streets and buildings on both sides of the river, in- 
cluding a population of betwixt 16,000 and 17,000 inhabitants. 
This makes it appear a place of more importance than it is, and 
equal in point of numerical strength to our third rate towns in 
Scotland. It has been united already in one way to this extent, 
by the parliamentary boundary laid down by the Reform Act, and 
it is in contemplation to incorporate Ayr, Newton, and Wallace- 
town under one civil jurisdiction, combining all their rights and 
privileges under one common interest. This plan seems to be op- 
posed at present, on separate grounds, by the magistrates both of 
Ayr and Newton; but the obstacles and objections to the junction 
may notperhaps be found insuperable by the national Legislature.

Clia7'te7' and Antiquity. — Ayr is one of the most ancient of our 
Scotch burghs, — a synod and presbytery seat, — a circuit station of 
the Justiciary Court, — the metropolis of the county which bears its 
name, — and the returning burgh of the set with which it is united 
in sending a Member to Parhament, viz. Irvine, Campbelton, In- 
verary, and Oban. It obtained its charter of royalty from King 
William, surnamed the Lion, in the year 1202. The charter itself 
does not bear date of the year in which it was conferred, but it has 
for witness to it the name of Florence, Archbishop of Glasgow, 
thus designed, electo cancillario meo Glasguensi. Now it appears 
from other records, that he was advanced to this high office during 
the year above-mentioned, and as it could not thus have been 
earlier, we cannot err much in fixing this as the date of it. This 
charter conferred on the burgh very important privileges, and very 
extensive property, extending its jurisdiction over the whole parish, 
and making over to it the whole of its lands, in perpetual tenure, 
for payment of a small feu-duty. This has been deemed a very 
magnificent grant, and so it was, as compared with grants conveyed 
in charters to other royal burghs. But it will not be apt to appear 
so very liberal, when it is considered that the whole parish, at that 
time, was one entire forest, and of very little value. The Kings of 
Scotland, however, had shown a more than usual munificence to 
Ayr on different occasions, as we find Alexander the Second con- 
firming his father's grant, and afterwards bestowing in addition the 
whole of the lands of Alloway, and extending the jurisdiction over 
the two parishes. 

Property.— It would appear that a subsequent charter was given 
to the town by King Robert Bruce, dated at Dunfermline, in which, 
besides confirming the grants and privileges conferred by his pre- 
decessors, he erects the parish of Alloway into a barony, under the 
lordship of the magistrates. That all this extensive territory was 
covered with forest trees, and consequently of little value, is evi- 
dent from the privilege having been conferred on the burgesses of 
Ayr, of acquiring such portions of the land as they might clear of 
wood, on paying twelve pennies yearly for every six acres so cleared. 
In the charter of Alexander in 1236, the burgesses are prohibited- 
from usingthe wood of the lands of Alloway, butfor useful purposes, 
and for their own accommodation. « Non ardebunt, nec dabunt,' 
nec vendent, nec aliquo modo distruent, sed solum modo capient

quod necessarium est ad propria aedificia sua de Are, etad proprias 
naves suas de Are faciendas." Many roots and pieces of oak and 
other timber are at this day found in bogs, and various other places 
in the parish, in tolerable preservation. The lands thus bestowed 
have long since been disposed of, and are in the possession of va- 
rious proprietors, but the superiority remains with the magistrates, 
and their jurisdiction still extends over the whole of the united parish. 
They were no doubt sold at what was considered a fair price at the 
time, but what we would reckon trifling compared with the present 
value of landed property. Had they been retained, they might have 
now yielded to the town a rental of betwixt L. 8000 and L. 10,000 
a year, which would have rendered it one of the richest burghs in 
Scotland. It is perhaps as well as it is. It is better for a public 
body to depend on the resources of enterprise and exertion, than 
on large patrimonial possessions. The annual income of the town 
amounts to upwards of L. 2000, arising from land, houses, feus, 
customs, &amp;c., and the expenditure to within a little of that sum, 
paid in salaries, interest on borrowed money, public burdens, and 
other disbursements. The public debt is little short of L. 20,000, 
the greater part of which has been laid out in the erection of the 
large handsome range of new buildings at the cross, together with 
the spire and Wallace Tower. In 1792, the town owed no debt, 
but then its income amounted only to L. 740 yearly.  

History. — Ayr appears to have been a town of some importance, 
long before the period to which authentic Scotch history extends. 
It is not mentioned in any of the Roman authors that we know of, 
but it is likely to have been well known to the Romans during 
their occupation of Scotland, as one branch of their great military 
road from Galloway into this district has been traced by some ob- 
vious remains, as we shall afterwards see, to within a short distance 
of where the town now stands, where it probably terminate'd as a 
military station or sea-port. Various relics have been discovered, 
such as urns and culinary utensils, at a considerable depth from 
the surface, which eem to bear marks of Roman origin. The 
place is repeatedly mentioned in the history of Scotland. Indeed, 
from its commanding position, as connected with the bay, and be- 
ing a point of easy communication with a widely extended district, 
it must always have been a place of considerable note. A castle 

• In 1835, the ordinary income was L. 2207, os. lOd., and the ordinary expendi- 
ture was L. 1881 , 3s. lOd , leaving a balance in favour of the town, of 1-. 3'2G, 2s., but 
the extraordinary expenditure is generally equal to the surpltis revenue.

was l}uilt near the mouth of the river by William the Lion, be- 
fore he granted his charter, erecting it into a burgh. This is 
distinctly stated in the charter itself, novo meo castello de Are. 
While the English forces occupied Ayr during the usurpation of 
Scotland by Edward I., they no doubt held possession of this 
castle also ; but probably, from its not being sufficient to contain 
them, they appear to have erected a temporary barrack or encamp- 
ment at the south-east side of the town, called the Barns of Ayr, 
to which Sir William Wallace set fire, he and his followers having 
retired to a neighbouring hill, since caWedi Burn or Barnweil, to sur- 
vey the conflagration they had occasioned. This remains a tradi- 
tion to the present day. This castle is mentioned in Scotch his- 
tory, as having been burned by King Robert Bruce in 1298, to 
prevent its falling again into the possession of an English army 
who were marching westward to attack him, whom he did not find 
himself strong enough to encounter. It seems to have been in con- 
sequence of this demolition, when he assembled his barons, and 
dignified clergy at Ayr sometime after, to settle the order of suc- 
cession to the throne, that the meeting was held in the church of St 
John. It was at this meeting, it is supposed, that the charter of 
constitution was granted to the barony of Newton-upon- Ayr, a band 
of the inhabitants of that place having fought under his banner, at 
the celebrated battle of Bannockburn. No traces now remain of the 
castle of Ayr : — but it probably stood at the east corner or bastion of 
Cromwell's Fort, not far from the academy. There are various 
other notices of Ayr to be met with in the annals of Scotland, but 
none of much historical importance, or that properly falls within 
the province of this account. We shall therefore proceed to exhibit 
a view of its present state with respect to improvements and public 
buildings. 

Improvements. — Few places have undergone a greater change 
for the better than this town has done, within the last twenty years. 
During that time, it has made greater advances in architectural 
and other improvements, than it had done perhaps during a century 
before. As a proof of this, we shall extract the following account 
of the state in which the town was. found by the writer of it, at the 
time the work was published in which it is contained ; and from 
personal recollections we do not think it exggerated. We quote 
from the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia. " The streets are ill lighted, 
wretchedly paved, and very indifferently cleaned. Side pave- 
ments of flag-stones for foot-passengers might be mentioned among 



22 



AYRSHIKE. 



the desiderata that might easily be suppHed. The prison, Hke 
the old tolbooth of Edinburgh, interlines and almost blocks up 
one of the principal streets. Security is the only consideration, 
which seems to have gained the attention of -those who planned 
this public nuisance, which is not so much the terror of evil doers, 
as the horror of those who do well," Now we have only to con- 
trast with this short but very graphic description, the condition 
in which the town now appears to strangers, in order to be impress- 
ed with the great improvement that has since been effected. The 
nuisance complained of — the old gaol — has been entirely removed ; 
by which means, a fine spacious street has been laid open from Wel- 
lington Square to the new bridge, improving progressively, by new 
edifices on both sides, of which the new spire with the spacious 
and elegant buildings attached to it, and the Ayrshire Bank, may 
be mentioned as specimens. The principal streets are well light- 
ed with gas, causewayed, and kept tolerably clean, and side pave- 
ments are generally formed from one end of the town to the other. 
The square already named on the west end, whether we consider 
the neatness of the houses, or the fineness of the situation, with 
its beautiful sea view, can hardly be surpassed in any othei; pro- 
vincial town in Scotland. 

County Buildings. — These are situated on the north-west side 
of this square, and were erected nearly twenty years ago, from a 
design by Mr Wallace, architect. They are formed after the 
model of an ancient temple dedicated to Isis at Rome, and cost 
the county an expense of upwards of L. 30,000, which was raised 
by an assessment under the authority of an Act of Parliament. 
The look of the structure, in front, is rather heavy from its mas- 
siveness, and not very imposing. It is certainly not nearly so orna- 
mental to the town, as a building costing so large a sum might have 
been made to appear. It occupies a very advantageous situation. 
There are only two stories, with an entrance in front, ornament- 
ed with large circular columns, formed out of immense blocks 
of stone brought from Arran, having capitals, architrave and en- 
tablature corresponding — covering a spacious portico, with a broad 
flight of steps leading to it from the area in front. From this, there 
is an entrance into a very handsome lobby, lighted from the top 
by a magnificent dome, rising to a considerable height above the 
whole building, and forming the most ornamental part of its ex- 
terior. The interior workmanship also, from the bottom to the 
top of the dome, is rich in architectural decorations to a very 



AYR. 



23 



great degree, and has been executed with great skiH, and at a very 
considerable expense. From the centre of the lobby, there rises 
a circular double staircase, of broad and easy ascent, leading to the 
apartments above. 

The lower part of the buildings is laid out in offices for gentlemen 
officially belonging to the law courts of the county and burgh, on each 
side of a long passage running lengthways from one end to the other. 
It is rather ill lighted, and even the offices, particularly to the back, 
though convenient enough otherwise, are liable to the same objec- 
tion. The upper storey consists chiefly of two large halls with ante- 
rooms for the judges and gentlemen of the court, and retiring rooms 
for the jury and the witnesses. One of the halls forms the Justi- 
ciary Court Room, and can hold upwards of 600 people. Above the 
Judges' bench, the royal arms of Britain are finely executed in stain- 
ed glass, which have a fine effect. At the east end is the County Hall, 
which was intended originally for a Jury Court Room ; but as these 
two courts never have occasion to hold their sittings at the same 
time, it has not been fitted up for this purpose. It is a large and 
splendid apartment, very richly finished, but, unless for being occa- 
sionally converted into a banqueting or ball room, it is nearly su- 
perfluous to the county for any public use. It contains a portrait 
of the late Lord Eglinton, in the uniform of the Royal Highland Re- 
giment, of which he was Colonel, representing the regiment as pur- 
suing a tribe of Indian savages in the woods of America, during the 
American war. It contains, besides, another portrait of Mr Ha- 
milton of Sundrum, late Convener of Ayrshire. Both of these 
were voted as a tribute of respect by the county, after their death ; 
— and, though the costume and bearing in which they are painted 
are not appropriate, this was owing to the artist having nothing to 
copy from, except originals of old date. 

Town's New Buildings. — These are very handsome and com- 
modious, and reflect great honour on Mr Hamilton of Edin- 
burgh, the architect. The site on which they are built, every- 
body allows, is unfavourable for showing them to great advantage. 
They stand on rather a low situation, and close to the street, and 
of course are not capable of being viewed as a uniform whole, from 
any commanding position at a proper distance. Several much 
more imposing situations might have been selected, but there were 
drawbacks in the way, it seems, in point of expense, and of private 
property interfering, and from other considerations, which prevented 
the authorities from fixing on more eligible ground. The buildings 



•24 



AyKSUIRE. 



contain an elegant spacious news-room, and various other apart- 
ments for town's meetings, &amp;c. all of which are constructed in such 
a manner, as to be capable of being thrown into one suit of rooms 
for public dinners, balls, and assemblies, on great occasions. The 
spire is 226 feet in height, said to be about the highest in Scot- 
land, and has a bell weighing 22 cwt., of a rich deep-toned sound, 
which can be heard at a great distance in calm weather. The 
spire is reckoned very handsome, and in good taste as to archi- 
tectural decorations and proportions. Its appearance has a fine 
effect, and is a great ornament to the town. During the winter 
of 1835, it was struck by lightning, more than midway from the 
ground, in a frightful thunder storm, which happened in the dead 
of night, occasioning great alarm to the inhabitants. The bolt 
■wrenched in an instant two of the large massy stones from their 
places, on one side of the building, driving one of them to a con- 
siderable distance, without, however, doing any material injury. 
The damage was repaired last summer, at a considerable expense, 
incurred chiefly by the difficult and complex construction of scaf- 
folding for the purpose. 

There is another ornament of a similar kind, also of late erec- 
tion, and from a design by the same architect. This is called 
Wallace Tower, for what reason does not appear. It has been built 
near the middle of the east side of the High Street, on the site of 
an old building of the same name, of many years standing, which 
was pulled down to make room for it. It appears to give great sa- 
tisfaction to the inhabitants of the east end of the town, as by its 
means they enjoy the benefit o'f a town's clock, and a bell for an- 
nouncing public worship. The tower is a handsome building, and 
is also very ornamental to Ayr, particularly as seen from a distance, 
its height being about 115 feet. The architect, in his design, ap- 
pears to have wished to erect something after the fashion of the 
Gothic-like structures of the days of Wallace. There is a statue 
of Wallace in front of the tower, in a niche towards the main street ; 
but the artist. Thorn, does not appear to have been very happy in 
his conception of the hero, either in point of costume or expres- 
sion of character. So far, however, as mere workmanship is con- 
cerned, it shows every indication of being well executed. 

Old and New Church. — The old church was erected about the 
middle of the seventeenth century, during the protectorate of 
Cromwell, to supply the place of the ancient church of St John, 
which he had appropriated to another purpose, in the new fort he 



AYR. 



25 



had built at Ayr. It is generally understood that he furnished the 
money by which the present edifice was erected, or at least ad- 
vanced a sum for that purpose; and this is quite consistent with 
his rigid profession of religion, and still more with his views of po- 
licy in concihating the Presbyterians. Nothing of this kind, how- 
ever, appears in the town's records. The sum said to have been 
received, betwixt L. 600 and L. 700, was of considerable magni- 
tude in these times, though perhaps not sufficient to cover the ex- 
pense of building the old church. Though it has nothing about 
it. to vie with the grand Gothic religious edifices of preceding 
ages, yet it is a fine old venerable structure, placed in a fine 
open retired situation behind the main street, surrounded with 
the town's burying-ground The walls are as substantial at this 
day, as when it was first built, and are likely to survive many 
later and more pretending edifices. It is constructed in the form 
of a cross, not unlike the old church of St John, the aisle to the 
north-west being a projection from the main body, in the middle 
of the east wall of which the pulpit stands, fronting the projecting 
wing. Though the walls and roof are perfectly sound and strong, 
yet, through the waste of time, the public have become alive to a 
variety of emendations, which it requires, and have lately employ- 
ed a competent architect in Edinburgh to survey it with this view. 
He, after a very favourable report as to the building, has furnish- 
ed a plan, we understand, which, if executed, will not only add to its 
internal accommodation and comfort, but also to its embellishment, 
both within and without. This plan, to be carried fully into effect, 
would cost a sum not much short of L. 1000. The funds of the 
burgh are not in a state to admit of much being given from that 
source ; but as the church is a very great favourite with the com- 
munity, and as a great part of the seats are private property, either 
belonging to public bodies or to wealthy individuals, it is probable 
that a sum may be raised by subscription adequate to effect, if not 
the whole of the projected improvements, at all events the most 
needful of them. For one thing, it is very inadequately lighted ; 
and, from the accumulation of extraneous matter in the churchyard, 
its floor is now considerably below the level of the surface without, 
which is apt to render it damp and disagreeable in wet weather. 
The seats, also, are getting old and rotten, and the passages re- 
quire to be relaid with flag stones. All this will be imperiously 
called for ere long, — not merely for improving its appearance, but 
from necessity, and in the view of real substantial utility. The 



26 



AYRSHIRE. 



Nexo Church has cost the town a large sum, — Httle short pro- 
bably of L. 6000. The original cost was upwards of L. 4000 ; and 
some years ago the roof having been found insufficient, had to be 
renewed at a considerable additional expense. It was erected in 
1810. It is a handsome enough building, both within and without, 
but suffers a miserable drawback in appearance as a church, on 
account of the want of a spire or tower. 

The Academy, as a building, is plain and not very ornamental, 
but it is chaste, and in good taste, and fitted up with very conve- 
nient teaching rooms for the masters, and a large handsome hall 
for public meetings. It stands in an open space to the north-west 
of the town, and occupies a very healthy and eligible situation. 

A large handsome new Inn has lately been built in a very con- 
venient situation near the town's buildings, which the rising im- 
portance of the place very much required. From its standing on a 
line with the main street, it does not make a very showy appear- 
ance, but what is better, it answers the public purposes of its erec- 
tion. 

There is a spacious military barrack situated in an open level 
ground near the harbour ; and during the war, Ayr was always a 
military station. This building is capable of containing a regiment 
of infantry ; but since the peace, it has been very Uttle used, as sol- 
diers are seldom quartered here, and Government propose dispos- 
ing of it for some other purpose. 

Burns' s Monument — This splendid monument stands on a rather 
commanding and tasteful position, on the summit of the east bank of 
the river Doon, near Alloway Kirk, the bank risingabove the stream, 
with a pretty bold acclivity, ornamented on its brow by an orchard, 
and the shrubbery that surrounds the building. It is situated at nearly 
an equal distance betwixt the Kirk and the Auld Brig, having the 
road to Maybole across the new bridge, passing it in an oblique di- 
rection. It consists of a triangular base, rising to the height of 16 or 
18 feet from the ground, built of very massive materials, rough 
and rustic in appearance. These are intended to represent the 
three divisions of the county, having a face to each of the districts 
Kyle, Carrick, and Cunninghame. Over this base, rises a super- 
structure of nine open circular columns, representing the nine 
Muses, with rich capitals of the Corinthian order, having a pro- 
jecting cupola, highly ornamented, surmounted by a gilt tripod. 
This tripod is supported by three inverted dolphins— fishes sacred 
to Apollo, who presided over the fine arts. In the construction 



AYR. 



27 



of the columns, the capitals, the cornices, and the ornamental de- 
corations of fruits, flowers, and foliage, the highest taste in archi- 
tectural science has been displayed, and the ingenious architect 
has evidently drawn largely from some of the best models of 
his profession both of Greece and Rome. The workmanship is 
the most elegant and masterly that can be conceived. It resem- 
bles more the monumental works of antiquity, than any speci- 
mens of modern art. Its height is upwards of 60 feet, and 
its erection cost about L. 2000, raised chiefly by subscriptions. 
There is a circular apartment within the base, 18 feet in diameter, 
and about 16 in height, lighted from above by a cupola of stained 
glass, opposite the entrance to which there is a semicircular recess, 
supported by Doric columns, intended for a statue of the poet. In 
this apartment, there is a copy by Stevens of Naysmith's portrait 
of him, said to be a good likeness. It contains, besides, an elegant 
edition of his works, and illustrative sketches of scenes and charac- 
ters in his poems, also by Mr Stevens, an artist belonging to Ayr, 
who has attained to considerable eminence as a portrait-painter. 

Around the monument, there is an inclosed piece of ground 
of nearly two acres, ornamented with fine gravel-walks, and the 
best collection of thriving ornamental shrubbery that can anywhere 
be met with. The shrubs were mostly supplied and planted gra- 
tuitously by the different gardeners and nurserymen in the county, 
who vied with one another in furnishing the finest specimens in 
their possession, from respect to the memory of the Ayrshire Bard. 
The back-ground of the inclosure has been planted with forest 
trees, which in a short time will screen in a great measure the 
base of the monument, and add to its picturesque appearance. 
In a low secluded corner, at the south side of this plot, a small ro- 
mantic-looking erection has been formed, in which are pjaced 
the far-famed figures of Tam o'Shanter and Souter Johnny, where 
they are hereafter to be allowed to quaff" their ale, and crack 
their jokes in quietness and retirement, after having travelled 
through the most populous towns of Great Britain, exciting the 
admiration and merriment of many thousand spectators. No per- 
son can behold these figures without being struck with the expres- 
sion of comic humour that is capable of being communicated to 
blocks of rough-grained stone. This is a power in the art of sta- 
tuary, which, we presume, was unknown to the ancients, and 
never was exhibited before with so striking an effect in modern 
times. The costume, too, is in excellent keeping with our con-

ceptions of the characters, and the whole design and execution re- 
flect great honour on the innate genius of Thorn, a self-taught ar- 
tist. A snug comfortable inn was built a few years ago, close by, 
for the accommodation of visitors, of whom there are many thou- 
sands, during summer, to the monument and scenes around it. 
Here they will find excellent fare at moderate expense, and kind 
and civil treatment. All these improvements have been carried on, 
under the immediate direction of Mr Auld, whose name deserves 
to be recorded for the good taste he has shown in embellishing 
this interesting spot, and enhancing, as far as art can go, the na- 
tural beauties with which it so much abounds. Those who resort 
thither for pleasure from a distance, or for health and recreation in 
the vicinity, must feel much indebted to him for a most delightful 
retired walk, which he has lately formed among the lofty trees of 
the picturesque bank below the new bridge, past the cool limpid 
spring, now gathered into a cistern, mentioned by Burns 

" Where Mungo's mither hang'd hersel". ' 

Eminent Men. — Joannes Scotus. — Ayr is distinguished as having 
been the birth-place of several men, who have attained to great 
celebrity by their genius and their talents, and who have done 
honour to their country, as well as to the place of their nativity. 
So far back as the ninth century, when the whole of Europe 
was sunk in the grossest ignorance, and even emperors and 
kings could hardly sign their own names, lived Joannes Scotusy 
surnamed Erigena ; a native of Ayr, as the word imports, a man 
of great learning, and the author of several distinguished works. 
His learning was derived from the fountain-head of letters, as 
he studied at Athens, where he acquired great proficiency in the 
Greek and oriental languages. He is said to have lived in great 
intimacy with Charles H., called the Bald, King of France, at 
whose request he translated the works of Dionysius into La- 
tin, which brought upon him the resentment of the Roman Pon- 
tiff, from which even royal patronage and friendship could not pro- 
tect himjso irresistible was the power of the Romish church, in 
those times of ignorance and barbarity. He fled to England, where 
he appears" to have been favoured by King Alfred, who employed 
him in aid of his attempts to restore learning at Oxford. 

Andreio Michael Ramsay, commonly known by the name of the 
Chevalier Ramsay, was also a native of Ayr, and was born in the 
year 1686. He was educated at Edinburgh, and afterwards stu- 
died at St Andrews, where he acted as tutor to a nobleman's son, 

3 



AYR. 



29 



with whom he afterwards travelled on the continent. He became the 
friend and associate of the celebrated Fenelon, Bishop of Cambray, 
by whom he was converted to the Roman Catholic faith, and whose 
life he wrote after his decease. His apostacy from the religion of 
his country and his kindred, is certainly not to his credit; but the 
circumstances that led to it are so imperfectly known, as to render 
us incompetent to pronounce an adequate decision. The Bishop 
was an amiable man ; and he might have been swayed by other 
motives than the force of opinion. He is best known in the lite- 
rary world, as having been the author of a popular work called the 
Travels of Cyrus. Besides his literary merits, he has some claims 
on the remembrance of Scotchmen, as having been tutor in the fa- 
mily of the son of James H. the ex- King of England, commonly 
called the Pretender. 

Robert Burns. — By far the most celebrated character that the 
parish of Ayr has produced, was Robert Burns, the Ayrshire poet, 
in whose genius and writings the whole of Scotland feels a proud 
distinction. He was born at AUoway on the 25th day of Febru- 
ary 1759, as appears from the register of births kept in this pa- 
rish. His parents were humble in station, but respectable in cha- 
racter,— of indigent circumstances, but great personal worth. 
They both lie buried in Alloway churchyard, where a plain neat 
tombstone has lately been erected to their memory, the original 
one having been destroyed by the action of the weather, or bro- 
ken into fragments and carried off by visitors, as relics or memen- 
toes of the deceased. His father's name was Burness, still re- 
tained by some of the collateral branches of the family, who be- 
longed originally to Montrose; and why the poet should have chang- 
ed his name to Burns, does not appear from his own writings or those 
of his biographers. The cottage in which the poet was born is still 
standing; a neat cleanly one-storey house, of humble appearance, 
with a thatched roof, situated close by the road side, and which 
has long been used as an inn. Humble as it looks at present, how- 
ever, it was still more so at the time of the poet's birth. A very 

 On the tombstone there is engraved the following beautiful and expressive epi- 
taph, the tribute of filial affection to parental worth : 

" O ye whose cheek the tear of beauty stains, 

Draw near with pious reverence and attend ; 
Here lie the loving husband's dear remains, 

The tender father and the generous friend, 
The pitying heart that felt for human woe, 

The dauntless heart that fear'd no human pride, 
The friend of man — to vicL= alone a foe, 

' For e'en his failings leant to virtue's side,'" 



30 



AYUSHIRE. 



comfortable snug room has since been built, by way of addition, at 
the west end of the cottage. The present kitchen is said to have 
been the apartment where the birth took place; and even the site 
where the bed stood is pointed out in a small recess in a corner of 
the room. The only other article that is shown to strangers con- 
nected with Burns, is a rough portrait of him in the costume and 
character of a ploughman in his holiday clothes, which hung long 
as a sign-board at the door of the inn. ° 
The country around the cottage is picturesque and beautiful in 
appearance, rich in soil, and highly cultivated, and finely diversi- 
fied with thriving and umbrageous plantations. In the immediate 
neighbourhood, runs the water of Doon, with its " bonny banks 
and braes," which he has so feelingly described in his immortal 
lyrics, and which, in the vicinity of AUoway Kirk, not a quarter of 
a mile from the cottage, is adorned by a landscape peculiarly rich 
in romantic scenery and associations. For three or four miles 
from its mouth, it flows between finely wooded banks, in some 
places precipitous, and interspersed with naked rocks, and brush- 
wood growing from their crevices, and in others, gently sloping 
from the bed of the stream, characterized by every variety of hill 
and dale, with all their interesting accompaniments of n:eadow 
pasture and cultivated fields, finely intersected with groves of forest 
trees. Sometimes it flows on in a straight line through uniform 
projecting ridges of banks, at the bottom of which it is hardly per- 
ceptible through the foliage of the overhanging branches ; and at 
others it exhibits abrupt or gentle bends in its current, pleasing 
the eye, in every form that is grand, beautiful, and attractive. 
Beyond the river, is the picturesque ridge of Brown Carrick Hill, 
finely diversified with clumps of planting, green pasture, fields of 
grain in their season, with " blooming heather," " lone glens ofgreen 
bracken," and " the burn stealing under the lang yellow broom." 
It was amid such scenery as this, that the genius of Burns was 
nurtured and furnished with excitement and materials to work up- 
on. It was here, where his early years were spent, where he re- 
ceived the rudiments of his education, where his first attach- 
ments were formed, where, " when summer days were fine," " he 
ran about the braes and paidled in the burn," and where he laid 
in that rich store of imagery and recollections which he has cm- 
bodied so sweetly in his fascinating poetry. About a mile and a 
half to the south-east of the place of his birth, lies the farm of 

Mount Oliphant, which his ftither afterwards rented, and where 

4 



AYR. 



31 



the poet spent some years of his early life. This farm, one of 
his biographers represents as of so churlish and ungrateful a soil, 
that the family, so far from realizing any property, scarcely drew 
from it a meager subsistence. It accordingly turned out a rumous 
concern, and threw a cloud over the spirits of the whole family. 
Burns, from his keener sensibility, felt the depression more than 
any of them, and he gives way to his melancholy feelings and 
prospects in the following pathetic strains : — 

" In poverty's low barren vale 

Thick mists obscure involved me round, 
Though oft I turned the wistful eye, 

Nae ray of fame was to be found. 
Thou found'st me like the morning sun 

That melts the fogs in limpid air, 
The friendless Bard, and rustic song, 

Became alike thy fostering care." 

It is unnecessary, in a work of this description, to point out the 
distinguishing qualities of a genius so well known to all the world. 
To Scotchmen in particular, his poetry will ever carry along with 
it a charm, immeasurably superior to what it can convey to any other 
people, because it brings forcibly home, in the most touching 
and simple imagery, to their bosoms, the scenes, the feelings, the 
habits, the pursuits to which they have been familiarized from their 
earliest years, and are accustomed to in every-day life. 

We can only regret that a mind so strong, and so gifted, should 
have so often transgressed the boundaries of prudence and pro- 
priety. Many apologies may be made, and have been made, for 
his aberrations. He was himself sensible of his errors, and unre- 
servedly acknowledged them, as in the following lines : 

" The poor inhabitant below. 

Was quick to learn, and wise to know, 

And keenly felt the social glow, 

And softer flame ; 
But thoughtless follies laid him low, 

And stained his name." 

John Loudon M'Adam, Esq. — This gentleman, the far-famed 
constructor and improver of public roads, was a native of the parish 
of Ayr. The leading principle according to which Mr M'Adam 
proceeded was, — that a road constructed on a level surface, 
with a layer or topping of fragments of primitive rock, about three 
inches deep, and broken so small as not to exceed two inches 
and a half in length, breadth, and thickness, would prove the most 
smooth, durable, and level of any other that could be formed. 
There are other details of the plan, but this constitutes its basis, 
and it has been fully justified by its success and useful results

as it is now in almost universal operation in all quarters of the 
globe, to the unspeakable comfort and convenience of- all tra- 
vellers. 

Mr M'Adam was born at Ayr on the 2lst of September 1756, 
and was descended from an old respectable family, who held the 
patrimonial property of Waterhead, in the parish of Carsphairn. 
His father claimed kindred with the powerful clan Macgregor, 
through a long line of ancestors, whose name had been changed 
when the clan was proscribed. He received his education in the 
parish school of Maybole, and was sent, when very young, to an 
uncle in America, where he succeeded in realizing a considerable 
fortune in New York, the greater part of which was lost by the 
Revolution, he having taken an active part on the Royalist side. 
Some time after his return to Scotland, he came to reside at Sau- 
chrie, in this county, where he acted as a deputy-lieutenant, a road- 
trustee, and the commander of a corps of artillery. On receiving 
from Government the appointment of superintendent of the vic- 
tualling department for the western counties of England, he went 
to reside at Falmouth ; afterwards he lived, for many years, in the 
neighbourhood of Bristol, where he became a trustee on the turn - 
pike roads, and where, having the entire confidence of those acting 
with him, he had full scope for carrying his plan of road-making 
into operation. In consequence of this, he was extensively con- 
sulted in this matter, and he and his sons became road-surveyors 
of several districts in England. In 1820 he received a grant from 
Parliament of L. 4000, to remunerate him for his trouble, and in- 
demnify him for expenses he had incurred, in the services of the 
post-office department. He died at Moffat, in November 1836, 
at the advanced age of eighty-one, revered by his family as a kind 
husband and parent, beloved by his friends for generous, steady, 
and gentlemanly dispositions and manners, and respected by the 
community at large for unostentatious piety, unflinching rectitude, 
and public-spirited usefulness. 

Lord Alloioai/.—Tci\id Cathcart was born in Ayr in January 
1764. His father, Elias Cathcart, was a respectable and influ- 
eniial merchant, who dealt in the French wine trade, and also 
traded with Virginia, in North America, prior to the revolution 
in that country. He enjoyed the honour of having been provost 
of the burgh. His son, David, received the ground-work of his 
education at Ayr schools, and afterwards prosecuted his legal stu- 



AYR. 33 



dies in Edinburgh. In 1793, he married Margaret Muir, daugh- 
ter of Robert Muir, Esq. of Blairston, through whom he succeed- 
ed to that estate. In improving it, he took great interest and de- 
light, and was in the practice of spending his summer months at 
Blairston House, now the patrimonial inheritance of his son, Elias 
Cathcart, Esq. Advocate, but now called Auchendrane — a beautiful 
and romantic residence in the old castle style, situated close on the 
banks of the Doon, about four miles distant from Ayr. The small 
but rich estate of Greenfield was also the property of his Lord- 
ship, inherited from his father, who purchased it, and resided there 
during the latter years of his life. On a corner of this estate, 
stands the old ruin of Alloway Kirk, from which he took his title, 
when he was raised to the Bench as a Lord of Session. This 
highly respected Judge was also, at the time of his death, one of 
the Lords of the High Court of Justiciary. He died at Blairston 
in April 1829, at the age of 65, and was interred in the venerable 
ruin of Alloway Kirk, where a plain but tasteful mausoleum has 
been erected to his memory. 

John Mair. — Mr John Mair was, many years ago, a distin- 
guished teacher in the schools of this burgh, from which he re- 
moved to Perth : he has acquired deserved celebrity as the author 
of several popular school-books, well known, and still used in 
public seminaries. The books we mean are, Mair's Introduction, 
his System of Arithmetic, and his Book-keeping, &amp;c. which were 
composed, if not published, while he was a schoolmaster in this 
town, and which show a knowledge of the Latin language, and of 
the principles of mercantile business, of no common kind. 

Professor Jackson.— The late Dr Thomas Jackson, Professor 
of Natural Philosophy in the University of St Andrews, was for 
several years Rector of Ayr Academy,— the duties of which situa- 
tion, he discharged with consummate ability and success. Dr Jack- 
son's talents were of the first order, and his acquirements were as 
extensive as his mental powers were acute and profound. He was 
fitted to excel in every department of science and literature. He 
was almost a universal scholar, and it is well known that he tauo-ht 
the Greek class in St Andrews with, as much ability and success, 
as if he had made Grecian literature his special study and profes- 
sion. So averse was he to all superficial pretensions, that, unlike 
a great proportion of those who aim at distinction, and do not in 
reality deserve one-half of the merit which they claim, or which 
they get sometimes,— the world might safely give him credit 



AYR.  



34 



AYRSHIRE. 



for one-half more of personal worth and intellectual power and ac- 
complishment, than what appeared in him outwardly. He had the 
nicest sense of honour, and the most refined moral delicacy of any 
man we have ever known, and withal he possessed such a fund of 
native good humour, kindliness of disposition, and urbanity of man- 
ners, as rendered him the most agreeable of companions in private 
life. He was the author of several able articles in the Edinburgh 
Encyclopaedia, and other works of a similar kind, and his Elements 
of Theoretic Mechanics, v/hich contain the substance of part of his 
lectures, are used as a text-book in the University of Cambridge. 
He was born in the parish of Carsphairn in 1773, received the 
early part of his education in the parish school of Tynron in Dum- 
fries-shire, and pursued his studies at Glasgow University with so 
much success, and with so high a reputation, that he was appointed to 
lecture for Dr Brown in the Natural Philosophy class, when he 
was rendered unfit for the duty himself. In 1799, he was chosen 
rector of Ayr Academy, removed to the Natural Philosophy chair 
in St Andrew's in 1809, and died there on the 17th of February 
1837, at the age of 64. 

John Fergiisson. — Besides the above eminent men who have been 
connected with Ayr, John Fergusson, Esq. of Doonholm, deserves 
to be mentioned, as having been one of the most enterprising and 
enlightened British merchants of his day, in Calcutta, where he 
made a handsome fortune, and established a mercantile house, 
which long continued to perpetuate his name, and to be distinguish- 
ed over the whole of India, for the extent and magnitude of its 
dealings and speculations. The benefactions of this gentleman to 
this parish, we shall afterwards have occasion to notice. His de- 
scendant, James Fergusson, Esq. of Monkwood, is at present one 
of the Principal Clerks of the Court of Session, and author of De- 
cisions of the Scotch Consistorial Court, where he formerly pre- 
sided as a Judge. 

Antiquities.— Ayr, though a place very ancient, has few monu- 
ments of antiquity to boast of. There are some, however, that pos- 
sess considerable interest, and which we shall now proceed to notice. 

St John's Church. — The burgh or parish church was dedicated 
to St John the Baptist, and is understood to have been founded 
in the twelfth century. Its form was that of a cross, the nave or 
body being nearly double the length of the transept ; and at the 
eastern end of the nave, there was a Gothic window of elegant form, 
and richly ornamented. Of this venerable Gothic structure, no- 



AYR. 35 



thing now remains but its tower, to which the west end of it was 
conjoined. Its form, however, may still be traced faintly by a 
careful survey of the ground on which it stood. The tower ter- 
minated at the top in two gables of a triangular form, as appears 
from a map with a figure of it, made in the reign of William III. 
In 1778, it was thought proper to remove these gables, and to erect 
a parapet in place of them, with turrets at each corner, to give it a 
more modern appearance. This was done at the expense of St 
John's Lodge of Free Masons in Ayr, and in this form it now stands. 
The church of Ayr was originally a rectory of considerable im- 
portance, and very richly endowed. A Mr David Livingstone, 
the rector of Ayr, was keeper of the Privy-Seal of Scotland under 
Kmg James III. As early as the fourteenth century, a prebend 
was founded in the cathedral church of St Mungo in Glasgow, 
from the fruits of the rectory, after which the church continued to 
be served by a vicar, and subsequently by a curate in 1449. 
There were besides, however, officiating chaplains appointed and 
paid by the town, who also seem to have performed the Catholic 
service at Alloway. There were four principal altars in the church 
of St John, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, to the Holy Cross, to 
the Holy Blood, and to the Virgin Mary, and other four were sub- 
sequently added, dedicated to St Michael, St Nicholas, St Peter, 
and St Ninian. One was in after-times upheld by the craftsmen 
ot Ayr, and dedicated to their patron saint. In 1560, the care 
of the church and parish was transferred to the reformed clergy 
among the first of whom was the Rev. John Welsh, who was a 
son-in-law of the celebrated Reformer Knox. During nearly 
a century afterwards, this building continued to be used as the 
only church of the parish, towards the latter part of which period it 
was made a collegiate charge, and served by two ministers. This 
was done by a provision of Queen Mary, in the shape of a dona- 
tion of certain mills and other emoluments, for which the town has 
compounded by a fixed annual stipend. In 1652, Oliver Crom- 
well, finding the ground around the church a fit situation for a 
fort, took possession of it for that purpose, and converted the 
church into an armoury. The exterior of it remained entire, long 
after the building of the fort, and even after its demolition. The 
present old church of Ayr was built to supply its place 

Former Encroachment of the Sea.~ln the reign of Robert the 
Second, a calamity, which seemed to threaten the ruin of the church 
and part of the town, rendered the royal interference necessary, and 



36 



ayhshtuf:. 



the circumstance is worthy of notice, for the purpose of showing 
how much the sea has receded since that time. The church-yard 
having been close by the church, the violence of the western storms 
appears to have been so great, as to uncover the-bodies of the dead, 
by blowing or washing away the loose sand in which they were 
buried. In order to avert this evil. King Robert granted a char- 
ter in 1381, offering as a reward to those who would devise means 
of protecting the town church, and cemetery from the blowing of 
the sand, such parts of those waste lands as they might be able, 
by their labour and expense, to render habitable, to be held by 
them and their heirs, in free burgage for ever, on payment of 
a penny, for each perch or rood so cleared. It does not appear, 
however, that the reward held out had the desired effect. The 
same annoyance was afterwards complained of by the inhabitants, 
as is shown by an application to the Duke of Albany, who . was 
Regent during the reign of Robert III., for Hberty to straiten the 
Sandgate Vennel, in order to guard against the same evil, which is 
represented as threatening the destruction of the town.- Liberty 
having been granted, an order to build the houses closer to one 
another was given by the magistrates in 1425. That such an an- 
noyance to so great an extent should have existed is apt to appear 
not a little strange at the present day, but from the above existing 
deeds, there can be no doubt of the fact. The receding of the 
sea and the building of the fort walls have totally removed the 
evil. 

Monastery of Dominicans.— kv appears to have been at all 
times amply provided with pastoral superintendence ; and, under 
the Roman Catholic religion, it enjoyed more than might now 
seem necessary for its population. A monastery o{ Dominicans, or 
black or preaching friars, as they were variously called, was found- 
ed by the Bishop of St Andrews in the year 1230, and a charter 
granted in its favour by Alexander II. dated at Forfar in 1242. 
This charter is confirmed by Robert Bruce, at Girvan, m the 
twenty-third year of his reign. This monastery was the first 
of the Dominican order that was established in Scotland, and its 
revenues became considerable, both by original endowment and sub- 
sequent donations. The Wallaces of Craigie appear to have be- 
stowed upon it considerable benefactions ; and one Allan Lauder 
gave to it, in perpetual aliment, part of the lands of Dankeith, for the 
souls of his wife Alice Campbell and all his posterity. There are 
several other gifts and mortifications which were made over to this 



AYR. 



37 



fraternity that might explain the source of some revenues still de- 
rived by the town. At the Reformation, the whole of what belong- 
ed to the monastery was bestowed on the burgh of Ayr by a char- 
ter of Queen Mary, for special purposes therein mentioned. A 
part of the property was only restored, as the town seems to have 
been very liberal in its grants to it. The buildings belonging to 
it were extensive ; but it is somewhat surprising, that not only no 
vestige of them remain, but that it is impossible to ascertain the 
precise situation on which they stood. In all probability, they were 
placed somewhere about the head of what is now called Mill Street, 
extendinsr from Wallace Tower down towards the river. 

Monastery of Franciscans. — A monastery of the Order of St 
Francis or Gey Friars was also founded at Ayr by the inhabi- 
tants, in the year 1472, as mentioned by writers on religious houses. 
Not the smallest notice is taken of it, however, in any of the records 
of the burgh that can be discovered, except in one instance, which 
serves at the same time to determine its situation. In a commu- 
nity meeting held in 1652, to deliberate on which of two sites pro- 
posed for the new church to supply the place of St John's, should 
be adopted, that of the Grey Friars was preferred. Of the con- 
vent and the buildings pertaining to it, there is no trace now re- 
maining, excepting its well of excellent water behind the wall of the 
old church burying-ground, close by the river, which is still called 
the Friar's Well About a mile and a half to the south-west of the 
town, stood a chapel dedicated to St Leonard, of which nothing can 
now be recognized. Neither is there anything known of its origin, 
its monks, or its revenues. Its ruins, it is said, existed not many 
years ago, but have now entirely disappeared. It stood in what is 
now called " Chapel Park," near Shawfield, on the farm of Slap-r 
house. From these notices of the religious estabhshments of Ayr, 
it would appear that the town had borne its full share in supporting 
the superstition of the times, and that the people had been by- 
no means lukewarm in the cause of religion, according to the light 
which they then enjoyed. 

• One of these purposes was the providing an endowment for a second minister 
from the revenues of certain mills which formerly belonged to the Friars, with the 
dues of thirlagc or multures over the parish. These mills now yield an yearly rent 
to the town of L. 331, 10s. and the compounding with the landed proprietors for the 
redemption of the multures must have produced, besides, a considerable sum, amount- 
ing probably to several thousands, Mr Oswald's lands, for instance, were redeemed 
for L, 600 ; Rozelle for L. 500 ; CastlchiU for L. 300 ; Sessionfield for L. 7o, and sa 
on in proportion. The town, from this, can have no cause to grudge any expense it 
is put to for hcvejil of clergy. 



•58 AYUSHIRE. 

Alloioay Kirk— Th.\s " auld haunted biggin'," the scene of the 
most talented of the poems of Burns, is an exceedingly plain old 
ruin, and not deserving of notice but for the celebrity which " Tam 
o'Shanier" has attached to it. It consists of two bare walls, one 
storey in height, with triangular gable ends ; in one of which, the 
old Kirk Bell still remains suspended. The date of its erection is 
uncertain, but the old walls are still entire, and in a state of good 
preservation ; so much so, that it might still have been used as a 
place of worship. At the time of the junction of the parish with 
Ayr, the stipend was so small as to be incapable of supporting a 
minister, amounting only to 600 merks Scots, and without any means 
of augmentation, the teinds having been all exhausted. The above 
sum is divided equally betwixt the two Ayr ministers; and the 
glebe, which is of no more than the legal extent, was given to the 
minister of the second charge. This glebe, however, upwards of 
seventy years ago, was sold to the magistrates of the burgh, with 
the sanction of the Presbytery, for L. 3, 6s. 8d. annually, which 
was then considered a fair equivalent. It now yields between 
L. 4 and L. 5 per acre, and is attached at present to the estate 
of Doonholm, so much has the value of land risen since that time. 
The minister of Alloway appears to have had also a manse, but no 
traces of it now remain. As to the old ruin of the kirk, there 
is little to be said in the way of description. One who had never 
seen it, in reading the vivid painting of scenery in connection with 
it by the poet, is apt to figure it in his imagination as some ex- 
tremely picturesque old sacred edifice, surrounded with trees, co- 
vering, with their dense gloomy shade, the comical yet frightful 
orgies that were a carrying on within its walls. It perhaps actu- 
ally did partake more of this character in the days of Burns, than 
it does at present, as the road from Ayr appears then to have run 
along the top of the bank of the river from the west, through the 
tall thick spreading plantation that grows in that direction. This 
is evident from the following hues : — 

" When glimmering through the groaning trees 
Kirk Alloway seem'd in a blecze, 

 • " 

. A winnock bunker in the cast 
There sat Auld Nick in shape o' beast." 

Now the " winnock bunker" here mentioned is still to be seen 
in the eastern gable from the west, but it is totally out of view from 
the present road, where not a single tree intervenes in approach- 
ing the kirk from Ayr. And, besides, the cairn and Mungo's well, 
referred to in the poem, are both of them to the west, of the kirk. 



AYR.

The walls of the ruin, which formerly gave access to strangers 
into the interior, have now been shut up and formed into a burial- 
ground for the Cathcarts of Auchendrane and the Crawfords of 
Doonside. 

The Moat of Alloioay is a place of considerable antiquity, and 
evidently of artificial construction. It is still to be seen on the 
right hand side of the avenue leading to the House of Doonholm. 
The magistrates of Ayr appear from the records of the town to 
, have frequently held courts of justice, for the trial of petty cases, ac- 
cording to their charter, on its summit, which was hollowed out in 
the middle like the crater of a volcano. This and the old tower 
of St John's Church are the only distinct monuments of great 
antiquity now existing in the parish. The old cross, which was 
removed in 1788, was a building, it is said, of some elegance, in 
the form of a hexagon. Coins of the reign of Charles II. having 
been found at its foundation, show it to have been erected in his 
reign. 

Roman Road. — The remains of the great Roman road, lead- 
ing from Galloway into Ayrshire, are perfectly distinguishable, 
within a mile and a half of Ayr. These no one can have any diffi- 
culty in finding, who wishes to examine them. They lie to the south- 
west of Castlehill gardens, behind the gardener's house, extending 
from near the avenue to the mansion, to the bottom of the hill to 
the south-east, anc up the adjoining hill, passing close by the 
farm-house of Breston. The features of this curious remnant of 
antiquity are distinctly marked, and can hardly be mistaken. We 
have seen also part of the same road in perfect preservation many 
years ago, in the neighbourhood of Dalmellington, bearing similar 
features. From this point, it appears to have run to the east of the 
River Doon, by the farms of Ponessan, Boreland, &amp;c. on to near 
Cockhill, from which it had been continued in a straight line, past 
Castlehill, Forehill, and Fowlcauseway, to Ayr, which it entered 
by the ground opened for quarries at the head of the town, and ran 
along in the direction of what is now called Mill Street. In many 
parts of this course, distinct traces of it could be recognized till 

 So much did the mama for collecting relics of Burns at one time pi-evail, that 
wh'en the old kirk was open to visitors indiscriminately, in the course of a very few 
weeks, the whole of the old oak that remained attached to the walls was torn away, 
to be manufactured into snuff-boxes, which are now valued by their owners as almost 
beyond price, A very handsome chair of an antique form was also constructed of the 
same wood, with the poem of Tam o'Shanter engraven on brass plates on the back, and 
presented by Mr Auld to his late Majesty George IV. during his visit to Scotland, 
and very graciously received. Another of the same kind was likewise gifted to the 
late Earl of Eglintou, and may be seen in Eglinton Castle.

Within a few years back, and there is reason to believe that with 
in little more than half a century ago, it formed the only road 
that was used for communication betwixt Ayr, and Galloway and 
Dumfnes-shire. Whether it was brought Xo Ayr, from its being 
at that time a town, a sea-port, or a military station, appears 
uncertain, though one or other of these may probably have 
formed the motive. It is far from being likely that it was made 
to run in this direction, either for shortness or convenience, since 
both the nearest and most level line to the Clyde, after passing 
Dalmellington, would have been by Old Cumnock, Irvine and 
-Largs. ' 

Battle-Fields. - On considering the above magnificent relic of Ro- 
man greatness, and other Roman antiquities that have been found in 
this parish. It appears evident that Ayr must have been a station 
ot considerable importance, while the Romans held possession of 
the country. There are manifest indications that the whole of 
the lower part along the sea coast, from river to river, had been 
the scene of some great struggle in which the Romans and the 
natives of the island were combatants, and that probably in 
more than one conflict. Throughout the whole of this space, Ro- 
man and British places of sepulture are found, with Roman ar- 
mour, swords, lances, daggers, and pieces of mail, and brazen 
camp-vessels, intermixed with British urns of rude baked clay, 
hatchet and arrow heads, and other implements of warfare used 
by the Caledonians. One of the largest and most beautiful of 
these urns was found some years ago, near the banks of the Doon, 
among a collection of ancient bones, — ' 



■" beneath the cairn 



Where hunters found the murdered bairn." 

We have seen a very antique Tuscan-shaped pitcher, in possession 
of a gentleman in Ayr, that was found many years ago on the top 
of the rock in the Town head-quarry, thirty or forty feet under the 
present surface of the ground, along with a kettle that has since 
been lost. What is somewhat remarkable, the pitcher when found 
was filled with sea shells, and has the appearance of having been 
glazed, which has been thought by some to militate against its 
claims to a Roman origin. We believe, however, it has been 
pretty clearly ascertained that the Romans were well acquainted 

 i;'ioso who wi.sh furtlior information on the subject, may consult Chalmers's Ca- 
ledonia, Vol. in. Ayrsliiii.. 



AYR. 



41 



with the art of glazing. The above quarry lies along the line, as 
we have said, in which the old Roman road must have passed, and 
a relic of this kind so far under ground, unless it had been placed 
there by some contingency beyond the usual course of things, 
carries along with it some plausible reasons for believing it of an- 
cient manufacture. At or near this place also, was the site of the 
famous Barns of Ayr. 

But we have not been left entirely to uncertain conjecture, or 
vague tradition, with respect to some great conflicts having taken 
place in this parish in ancient times, both betwixt the Romans and 
the natives of the country, and with the latter amongst themselves. 
Having been led to make some investigation into the subject, we 
have found some light thrown upon it, by the following autho- 
rities : Spottiswoode, in his history, relates that " in the year 
360, Maximus, a Roman Prefect, excited the Picts to enter into 
alliance with him against the Scots, and that the Romans and 
Picts encountered the Scots at the Water of Doon in Carrick. 
The Scots were routed, and thus King Eugenius, and most of his 
nobility were slain." That a great battle was also fought in this 
locality, betwixt the Britons and the Scots and Picts united, is as- 
serted by Hollingshed, Boethius, and Buchanan. The first of 
these represents the Silures, as inhabiting the region now known by 
the name of Ayrshire, and states that " Coilus, King of the Bri- 
tons, having assembled an army, entered the Scottish borders lying 
towards the Irish Sea, wasting with fire and sword whatever he 
found in his way, till he came to the river Dune, where he encamp- 
ed on the banks." Boethius says, evidently in reference to the 
same invasion, that while Coilus was King of the Britons, the 
Scots and Picts attacked him, " ad ripam amnis Dunse," the Scots 
in front, while the Picts came upon him from behind, during night. 
" Dum Coilus ipse servaretur incautius a suis, oppressus occubuit, 
loci nomen Coilum ad posteros relinquens." Buchanan, in his His- 
tory of Scotland, gives a more detailed account of this battle 
than either of these. Lib. 4th, cap. 4. To retaliate a hostile in- 
cursion, he relates of King Coilus, " Britto-Scottorum fines ingres- 
sus, ad Dunum usque amnem penetravit, &amp;c. After narrating other 
particulars, he thus concludes his account. " Eductis copiis Scoti a 
fronte, Picti a tergo invasuri, ad hostem ante lucem perveniunt, &amp;c. 
Cecidit cum parte majore suoriim Coilus : ipse regionem in qua pug- 
natum est, de suo nomine celebrem fecit." There is a tradition 



42 



AYRSHIRE. 



Still existing in this district, that after some great battle, two Kings, 
Coilus and Fergus, gave their names, the former to Coil and Coyl- 
ton, the latter to Loch Fergus, and Mount Fergus in this parish, 
local tradition assigns the site of the battle -to the parish of Dal- 
rymple, which is not in any degree probable. The armies on both 
sides must have been numerous, since according to Buchanan, 
Coilus could easily spare five thousand men to be placed in am- 
buscade, and the narrow vale of the Doon, in the above parish, 
could afford no eligible ground for such a conflict. On the other 
hand, the lower part of this parish flanked by its two rivers, with 
the sea in front, and the undulating ground behind, even at the 
present day, could yield to no other locality in point of advanta- 
geous battle ground. Besides, the expression on the banks of the 
Doon towards the Irish Sea, is sufficient to settle the point, as the 
Irish Sea could only mean the Bag of Agr, — not then known by that 
name, and being a continuation of the Irish Sea. 

CroniwelVs Fort. — Oliver Cromwell seems to have had two ob- 
jects in view, by the erection of the citadel now called the Fort. 
In thezrs place, he intended it to serve as a military station for a 
large body of troops, to overawe and defend the west and south of 
Scotland; and, secondlg, he wished by its means to secure the 
command of the town and harbour of Ayr, both at that time of 
more importance, from the state of the times, than they are at pre- 
sent. In correspondence with these objects, the citadel itself was 
both capacious and strongly fortified. As we have seen no account 
given of it in" any other work, and as it is an object of considerable 
interest as connected with the antiquities of Ayr, we shall conclude 
our notices on this subject by a short description of its plan and 
construction, which we are enabled to present from the notes of a 
friend who has examined it for us minutely, and who is a compe- 
tent judge of works of this kind. The area within the walls, which 
on three sides are yet entire, is about twelve acres in extent. The 
ground plan is a hexagon, with bastions at the angles, but the fi- 
gure is not regular, the two sides facing the sea and the town be- 
ing much longer than any of the others. The situation is between 
the town and the mouth of the river, and the strongest works front 
the latter. The main bastion, occupying the north-eastern angle, 
close upon the harbour, and next the town, commands the entire 
circuit of the fortifications, the river, and the town itself. It has 
still an elevation above the water of forty-five feet, and is suppos- 
ed to occupy the site of the ancient palace and castle of Ayr, built 



AYR. 



43 



by William the Lion. The sides of this bastion, like those of the 
other four, which are yet to be traced, vary from 120 to 135 feet 
in length, and their angles are regular, according to the system of 
fortification now in use. 

Proceeding parallel to the river, along the rampart, but on a 
plane about fifteen feet lower, we arrive at a second bastion, con- 
nected with the former by a curtain 237 feet in length. The works 
now trend towards the west, and a second curtain, 266 feet long, 
conducts to a third bastion. These appear to have formed the 
main part of the fortifications, and have been erected with great 
care and at very considerable expense. The rampart is everywhere 
faced on the outside with a wall, strongly and exceedingly well 
built, of hewn-stone, inclined at the proper angles, and entire. 
The whole is sustained on arches, which have formed convenient 
securities for garrison stores and provisions. The breadth of the 
rampart is in this place 120 feet. The works now sweep almost 
directly west, running parallel to the sea-line, and, when first exe- 
cuted, had occupied the whole of the dry ground on this side. 
Though the sea has now retired to a considerable distance, leav- 
ing a fine sandy beach, yet some of the oldest inhabitants remem- 
ber when the walls here were washed by the tide at high-water. 
This seaward curtain is 512 feet long; and though the rampart 
continues of the same height, viz. about 20 or 25 feet above the 
level of the sands, yet it has been narrow and without arches, hav- 
ing been composed of solid earth, faced with the same solid ma- 
sonry as already described. At the termination of fhis sea-wall, 
and joining the western angle of the fortification, is a fourth bas- 
tion, which, though smaller than the others, has been constructed 
with equal care and skill. From its position near to what must 
have been formerly the mouth of the river Doon, which we have 
already attempted to prove, this point must have been very strong. 
A curtain, 272 feet, running nearly south, conducts to a fifth bas- 
tion ; but here the original rampart can no longer be traced, 
though the garden-walls of the adjacent houses are built upon its 
foundations, and clearly show its position. The sixth and last bas- 
tion has occupied the southern angle of the fort, but of this no 
part now remains. A long curtain and deep broad ditch had form- 
ed the prmcipal defences towards the town, joining the south to the 
eastern bastion, whence we started in this descriptive circuit of the 
fortifications. Of this side of the citadel, the only remains are 
the hollow of the ditch, and the gate of the front wall. The lat- 



44 



AYRSHIRE. 



ter IS a round-headed arch, with some heavy but not inelegant 
mouldmgs, surmounted by a square recess, in which once stood the 
arms of the Commonwealth of England. The interior of the fort- 
ress has been a large open space, of an oblong square shape, oc- 
cupied with barracks for the military, and other buildings, Ld the 
Church of St John, and its tower, which had been concerted into 
an armoury and guard-room, thus literally becoming a church mi- 
htant. Ihe stones of which the fort was built were brought 
all the way fron. Ardrossan, by water carriage, and the whole cost 
so large a sum that, when reported to Cromwell, he is said to have 
asked If It had been built of silver. As the whole must in process 
of time disappear, we are glad of this opportunity of recording 
what remains at the present day, as a monument and memorial of 
a period so remarkable in the history of Britain. 

III. — Population. 
At the time of the Rebellion in 1745, the population is said 
to have been only about 2000 ; when the last Statistical Account 
of the parish was published in 1791, it was 4100; and the last 
census in 1831 fixes it at 7606. Since the Government cen- 
sus, a further state of the population was taken in 1836, in order 
to make returns to the Royal Commission appointed to inquire 
into rhe want of religious instruction in Scotland, when the 
amount was found to be 7475, making a decrease of 131. But 
this might easily be accounted for, from the great mortality that 
took place in Ayr, in consequence of the disease of cholera, in 
1832, which swept away a great many of the inhabitants. The 
population of the town within the toll-bars in 1836, was 6240, of 
which 2963 were under twelve years of age ; and that of the" coun- 
try part of the parish, was 1235. The number of families amount- 
ed to 1647, making four and a little more than a-half the average 
number of each family. There is a considerable number of gen- 
tlemen of independent fortune residing in the town and neighbour- 
hood, as many resort thither for the sake of education for their 
children at the Academy, and to enjoy the advantages of the agree- 
able society of the place. A good many of this class have made 
fortunes in India, and in other places, both at home and abroad. 
The number of landed proprietors of tlie yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards, amounts to 12,— their rentals varying from that sum to 
L. 2500. The following is a state of the number of births, mar- 
riages, and deaths for the last six years, since the last census was 
published.

From the above details, it will appear thatAyr is progressing in point 
of population ; though slowly, yet as steadily as most other towns m 
Scotland of the same rank, where the increase is not dependent on 
contingent or temporary causes, such as manufactories and other 
extensive public works. It has httle of this kind to depend on, for 
its prosperity. The produce of mechanical labour in very few ar- 
ticles exceeds, and in many falls short, of the consumption of the 
inhabitants. Hence the population is mostly indigenous, with 
the exception of some families of Irish labourers of the poorer 
class, who have been induced to become resident here, as in 
most other towns in the west of Scotland, from no strong tempta- 
tions as to remunerative employment, but because any change 
whatever from their miserable condition in their own country was 
likely to be a change for the better. Those of the natives, how- 
ever, with whom they mingle in the same station, have little cause to 
thank them for settling among them, not only as they keep down 
the price of labour by competition, and curtail the chances of em- 
ployment, but because they have tended in no small degree to demo- 
ralize their characters, and to undo the sturdy feelings of indepen- 
'dence, for which Scotchmen, until of late, had been so much dis- 
tinguished, by inducing them to become claimants and sharers alike 
with them in public charities, in which they think they have a bet- 
ter right to particijpate than strangers. 

Character. — In exhibiting an estimate of the character of our 
population, it may be as well to begin with the lowest class, — those 
in a state of pauperism, or bordering upon it ; and here we are 
compelled to acknowledge that they have been greatly deteriorat- 
ed of late years, both in their civil and moral condition, from the 
cause we have noticed above. There are few places where the 
poor are better attended to and provided for than in Ayr, and 
they know this full well. Practical benevolence to the needy and 
distressed is a leading characteristic of the inhabitants, and one 
of the fruits of this has been, that numerous charitable bequests, 
mortifications, and institutions, exist for mitigating or removing in 
one shape or other the evils of poverty. These, however, have in 
some respects had an opposite effect from that designed, as they 



AVRsiimn. 



liave tended to .nerease the number of applicants and expectant, 
and to ,„dnce the needy to seek to establish a legal res de„ e 
he pansh solely on their account. The managemLt of he poo  

funds also, benig under so numprnn«  hA r r .  

bably had the effect of cTeat rL 1 P- 

interest; in favour of tL poor Tan in T'l ' "

bT/err;; " 'r  

Dy general rule and hence applications for aliment are decided 
on more by feehng, m some cases, than by expediency Add fo 
all this, that there is hardly a family in the highe; mtd i„g 
classes of society, that have not their set of dependents or hang 
on for private bounty, that partake of what they can spare f re- 
Iieve their wants and render them comfortable, and whom they Ze 
always earnest to recommend to pubhc charities. Now all thij ex 
hibits bo h an amiable and a Christian spirit ; but the consequence 
of It has been, that one out of every tnenty-three of the population 
IS a pauper, whereas m Glasgow, the proportion is one in eZy 
It must be perfectly obvious, therefore, that such a state 
of things must have a tendency to deteriorate the civil and moral 
condition of the lower orders, by breaking down their feelings of 
independence, and thus by making them respect themselves less 
rendering them less respectable in the eyes of others. 

With these exceptions, however, it cannot be denied that the 
inhabitants of Ayr, in general, will bear to be compared with 
those of any other town in Scotland, in regard to those quali- 
ties that render a people happy, orderly, and respectable. Thev 
are attentive in general to religious duties, and are also steady and 
peaceable in their socifil and domestic conduct. They have felt, 
no doubt, like those of other places, the fermentcation and excite- 
ment occasioned by the agitation of questions of reform in Church 
and State; but these have never been carried the length of makina 
them forget the ordinary proprieties of life. On the contrary, we 
rather think that any bitternesses thereby produced have been less 
marked here than elsewhere. There are few instances of open crime 
among even the lowest of the population, and it is certainly much 
to their credit that order is preserved, and property secure, without 
the protection of any regular system of police. The streets, and 
lanes, and suburbs, may be traversed at all hours of the night in 
perfect safety, and popular brawls and tumults are of very rare oc 



AYR.

currence. The use of ardent spirits is sl.ill indulged in, among the 
working-classes, to a greater extent than is beneficial to their 
health and morals ; but they are not in this respect worse than those 
of the same class in other places. A wish to maintain public de- 
cency seems to be felt by all, and the influence of public opinion 
is fully as operative here as elsewhere for the repression of vice, and 
the encouragement of social and personal virtue. Except among 
a few of the low Irish, a general desire prevails among parents to 
have their children educated, and they enjoy opportunities for this 
purpose more ample than in most other towns, which put this 
blessing easily within the reach of the very poorest of the popula- 
tion. We confine these remarks chiefly to the lower orders of so- 
ciety, and we wish them to be understood as applicable in a very 
general way. 

Speaking of the inhabitants at large, we would say that they are 
rather of a gay and social temperament. They are much given to 
hospitality and kindly fellowship with one another, and among the 
higher and middle ranks in particular, social intercourse is con- 
ducted with urbanity and easy politeness. Every thing like gross 
intemperance has been discarded. From the highest to the low- 
est, there is a natural propensity to press upwards ; this distin- 
guishes all sections of society ; it may appear a little more ridicu- 
lous in a provincial town than in the elite of the west end of Lon- 
don, or the fashionable saloons of Paris ; but still it emanates from 
the same all-pervading principle. The society in Ayr, taking it all 
in all, is as agreeable and well-regulated and as fashionable as can 
be met with, in any other county town. 

Races, Sfc. — Races are held yearly, generally on the first week 
of September, by the Western Meeting, for which there is an ex- 
cellent course in the vicinity of the town ; and the Caledonian 
Hunt assembles here once every five years. There are two packs 
of fox-hounds and one of harriers kept in the neighbourhood, for 
the amusement of those who are fond of such sport ; and angling 
and shooting may be easily practised by such as feel so inclined. 
These and other amusements, enable the inhabitants to pass their 
hours of relaxation very agreeably, ,and help to maintain a steady 
cheerfulness of temperament, a dignified sociability of character, 
and a pleasant and frank demeanour towards one another. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — Ayrshire stands eminently distinguished among 
the other counties of Scotland, for agricultural improvements.

Though it has not been so highly favoured as some of them, in 
point of richness of soil, yet it will yield to none for the intelligence 
of its peasantry, and the emulative spirit which they discover in 
the hne of their pursuits. During the last /ew years, they have 
in general devoted much of their attention to the study of agri- 
culture as a practical science ; and erroneous processes in the culti- 
vation of the soil, which antiquated prejudice, or inveterate custom 
had long retained, are gradually becoming obsolete,— while useful 
improvements and discoveries are eagerly substituted in their place. 
Farmer's societies have done much to introduce a more enlighten- 
ed mode of husbandry, than formerly prevailed. This has been 
greatly aided also, by the example of many of the landed proprietors, 
who themselves farm on a large scale; and having the means 
amply in their power, are not backward in trying experiments which 
their tenantry are ready to adopt, when found to be beneficial. 
But what has of late given a stimulus to improvement, and excited 
an emulation to excel in agricultural pursuits, more than any other 
circumstance, is the institution of the Ayrshire Agricultural Associ- 
ation, which was formed in 1835, after the model of the Highland 
Society of Scotland. It embraces among its members the most 
distinguished in the county for rank, intelligence, and respectability ; 
and it has the effect of bringing the landed proprietors and their 
tenantry in closer alliance with one another, and of keeping up 
among them a more systematic regard for their reciprocal interests. 
It appoints agricultural shows to take place periodically in the 
principal towns of the county, where premiums are awarded for farm 
stock and produce of all kinds, and also for useful inventions ; and 
the keenest competition is thus excited on a large scale, not so 
much for the value of the prizes offered, as for the honour which 
success confers. We look on this Association as calculated to prove 
of the utmost benefit to the interests of agriculture, and as reflect- 
ing great honour on those from whom it originated, and we have 
deemed it proper to notice it here as more particularly belongi g 
to the county town. We shall now proceed to give a brief outline 
of the state of agriculture as confined to Ayr parish, which in this 
respect is probably not behind any other in the county. 

As the surface is composed of different kinds of soil, husbandry 
is of course prosecuted after different modes ; but its general cha- 
racter is judicious, and distinguished for skill in the management 
as well as success in the result. Even in the least fertile and kind- 
ly districts, where the land consists of a cold stiff clay of from four 



AYR. 49 

to six inches in depth, on a substratum very retentive of moisture, 
the fields are all well subdivided and fenced in with thorn hedges, 
the ridges are as straight as the nature of the surface will admit, 
and the ploughing and dressing appear as well executed as could 
be expected in such circumstances. The rotation of cropping here 
followed is, 1. oats from lea; 2. fallow dressed with lime and dung; 
3. wheat, and lastly, hay; after which it is laid down in pasture for 
three or four years. As a considerable portion of the land must thus 
remain in grass, much attention is paid to the produce of the dairy, 
for which a ready sale is found at the market-town, or by purchas- 
ers from Glasgow. Tile-draining has been practised to a consi- 
derable extent, and with great advantage on such a soil as this; 
and the farmer is sometimes aided by his landlord in the necessary 
expense thus incurred, by an allowance made when a new lease is 
granted. In the lower and more level parts of the parish, the soil 
is rich and loamj', either on a clay bottom, or an open porous sub- 
soil, and is from five inches to two feet in depth. The rotation 
followed is, 1. oats ; 2. green drilled crops of potatoes, turnips, &amp;c.; 
3. wheat ; 4. hay ; and lastly pasture. Tile-draining is here also 
practised extensively, and with the happiest effects. Irrigation 
is little tried in the parish, though in many parts it might be at- 
tended with good results. The most enlightened and extensive 
improvers of land, are, Archibald Hamilton, Esq. Rozelle; James 
Ballantine, Esq. of Castlehill ; Andrew Hunter, Esq. of Doon- 
iholm; Colonel M'Neight of Barns; and John Robb, Esq. of 
Blackburn, who may be said to have new made his small estate. 
By some of these, the subsoil plough has been used with ad- 
I vantage. Some farmers, where the soil is deep enough to admit 
of it, have begun to try the experiment of deep ploughing ; and it 
cannot fail to succeed, as new earth is thereby turned up and work- 
ed upon in the room of the surface mould, which is apt to lose its 
strength and freshness, by repeated cropping from only a few inches 
depth of soil. It must have an effect somewhat akin to trenching, 
■which is always productive, and we wonder why it is not more ge- 
nerally practised. A considerable extent of ground near the sea ' 
has been converted from heaps of barren sand, into tolerably good 
■soil. The principal obstacle to cultivation here is the want of ad- 
hesion, but a remedy has been tried for this, and we believe with 
success ; by mixing the sand with clay, great quantities of which 
had been thrown out in digging for coal, in the vicinity of the har- 
bour. Leases are generally held for nineteen years.

Rent, 8fc. — Tlie rent of land varies from L. 4, odds, to a rate as 
low as 15s. per acre; the average may be about L. 1, 10s. or L. 1, 15s. 
The farm-steadings are in general good and convenient, and on the 
Rozelle estate they have been moslly all , renewed within the last 
few years, the dwelling-house, consisting of one storey, with three 
apartments, besides a kitchen and garret, covered with a slated 
roof. The usual rate of grazing is L. 3 for a cow or ox, and 10s. 
for a sheep, yearly. This, however, depends very much on the 
nature of the pasture. In some of the richer lands, a ewe or full- 
grown sheep may cost from 15s. to L. 1. 

Wages.— wages of labourers amount to 8s. a week in win- 
ter, and from 9s. to 10s. in summer. In harvest, an exception to 
this must be made, when they are sometimes so high as 2s. 6d. a 
day. Hired farm-servants, fit for the ordinary work of a farm, 
receive about L. 12 a-year, females L. 6, with bed and board. A 
cartwright and blacksmith can earn from 12s. to 15s. weekly. 

Z/zye-iStoc/t.— The sheep used as farm-stock are of the white- 
faced breed, chiefly of the Leicester and Cheviot kinds, introdu- 
ced within the last twenty years. Such of the farmers as can raise 
extensive green crops prefer the black-faced breed, which they 
turn upon their turnip-fields in winter. They thus both improve 
the land, and are generally found to yield a good return when 
brought to the market. The cattle used are of the genuine Ayr- 
shire breed, now generally known over the whole of Scotland, and 
which here has been brought to great perfection. The short- 
horn kind has lately been introduced on some farms, but they are 
not likely to increase, as the pasture is supposed not to be well 
adapted to them. The following is a list of some of the lately in- 
vented agricultural implements that are made use of by some who 
farm on a superior scale, but they are not generally employed : 
1. The subsoil plough, invented by Mr Smith of Deanston, for 
loosening the substratum of earth, on still lands. 2. A machine 
for sowing wheat and bone manure in drills. 3. A soil furrow 
presser, which is well adapted for consolidating light soil, and is 
better than a roller for this purpose, as it prevents the seed from 
getting to the bottom of the furrow, and produces a more regular 
braird, 4. A machine for sowing wheat and rye-grass seeds, 
broadcast, is also much approved of by those who have tried it. 
The best farms in the parish are Holmstone and Greenfield, both 
of which are worked in a superior style. The latter is perhaps 



AYR. 



51 



the most agreeable to manage, and the best fitted for all sorts of 
crops of any in the county, though highly rented.

Agricultural Museum. — An attempt has been made within the 
last twelvemonth, by a few spirited individuals, to institute an 
agricultural and horticultural museum, but as yet it has been attend- 
ed with very doubtful success. We are rather surprised at this, 
as there is a splendid and extensive thing of the kind in Stirling, 
for that county. 

Fisheries — SaZmon.— That salmon were caught, in much great- 
er abundance, in the rivers Ayr and Doon, than at present, and 
that they constituted a principal part of the food of the poor, is 
evident from printed regulations which we have seen of the Poor's 
house, about the time when it was estabhshed, in 1759. In these, 
it is directed that this fish was to form the diet of the paupers twice 
every week. We have also seen it recorded somewhere, that farm- 
servants in the vicinity of the Forth, in Stirlingshire, used to sti- 
pulate in engaging with their masters, that they were not to dine 
upon salmon more than twice weekly. For some months, the fish- 
ing is confined almost exclusively to the Doon, in consequence 
of which, and the scarcity of the fish, the price seldom falls 
lower than Is. 6d. a pound, till the Girvan and the Stinchar, 
along with the Ayr, furnish their upply to the market, when it 
is reduced so low as 6d., in tolerably good fishing seasons. The 
Doon salmon fishing belongs to the Marquis of Ailsa, that of 
the Ayr to Mr Oswald of Auchincruive. The former is rent- 
ed for L. 235, the latter for L. 45, annually. The same tacksman 
at present holds the lease of both, extending from the mouth of 
the Doon to the Pow Burn, beyond Prestwick. For two or three

months after the season opens, he fislies only with drag-nets, in 
the rivers ; after which, stake-nets are erected, and ten or twelve 
men are constantly employed. The fish, besides supplying Ayr 
market, are sent to Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Carlisle, and some- 
times even to London. Poaching is occasionally detected, but it 
is not practised to any great extent. 

White or Sea Fishing.— Kjv is, at all times, supplied with abun- 
dance of excellent fish, there beingin the market sometimes no fewer 
than upwards of twelve varieties. Its port has been long the prin- 
cipal fishing station on the west coast ; but since the introduction of 
navigation, so many facilities have presented themselves for the con- 
veyance of fish to the great markets, from other points of the Frith 
of Clyde, and particularly fpom the Argyleshire coast, that many 
fishers have removed thither from this place. The number of 
boats employed in the trade, at present, does not exceed one-half 
of what it was twenty years ago. Formerly, the whole Frith 
and all its lochs were tributary to the Ayr fishers, who carried much 
of the produce in wherries to Greenock and Glasgow. Now, how- 
ever, by the location of fishers on other parts of the coast, they 
are limited in their operations to Ayr and its vicinity, and to the 
supply of the Ayr market. At present, there are only seven boats 
employed, with four men in each, and their attention is wholly di- 
rected to the fishing of cod, ling, haddocks, whitings, turbot, skate, 
flounders, mackarel, and herrings, for home consumption. All these 
kinds of fish are scarce in comparison to what they once were. 
This has been attributed by some to severe fishing, and by others to 
the comparative absence of herrings, which do not spawn on this west 
coast to the extent to which they did formerly. It is a well known 
fact, that wherever this fish is in abundance, cod, ling, and turbot, 
which are never seen in some places except in company with them, 
are also to be had in great plenty. In former years, 120 stone of mis- 
cellaneous white fish have been often taken in a day, from the Frith 
of Clyde by one boat ; whereas 70 stone is now reckoned great fish- 
ing, and the average weight brought to Ayr, per day, may be stat- 
ed at 12 stone for each boat, during the best of the season, and 
5 stone during the worst. Herrings and mackarel are only got in 
season, during the summer months. 

In addition to the fish above-mentioned, soles, red gurnard, or 
gurnet, halibut, large conger eels, &amp;c. are occasionally taken and 
brought to market. Among those found in the bay of no econo- 
mical importance are, the porpoise, miller's-thumb, fiddle-fish, 
sun-fish, pilot-fish, ink-fish, &amp;c. The grey gurnard is abundant. 



AYR.

but it is never taken for sale. Shell-fish of every kind are scarce. 
A few lobsters and crabs are caught in traps placed on the outside 
of sunk rocks, in the bay. The black rock, near the Troon, is a fa- 
vourite haunt for them, where they are occasionally taken. The 
mode of catching white fish followed here, is with long lines. 
Each boat works from 12 to 14 hues, each line having 1800 
hooks suspended from it, at the distance of an ell from each other. 
The bait used for small fish is mussel, from about Jammas till 
April, and a worm dug from sandy shores, left dry at ebb-tide, call- 
ed lug, during the remaining part of the year. The bait used for 
large fish is herrings and small whitings, which are both taken 
in preference to haddocks and other small fish. The lines for 
small fish are all shot or laid in before day-break, and immediate- 
ly thereafter taken up. In fishing cod, &amp;c. in deep water, lines 
may be shot in day-light. Turbot is chiefly fished with nets, and 
it is not many years since it began to be fished at all, or was 
known to exist in the bay. Next to salmon, this fish is now the 
favourite for dinner parties. 

Manufactures. — It has often been a matter of surprise, that Ayr 
has not been more benefited by manufactures and public works, — 
possessing as, it does, so many advantages for this purpose, and 
such facilities of communication with other places both by sea and 
land. With such an extensive grain country surrounding it, dis- 
tilleries could not fail to thrive; the price of labour is low rated, 
and all .the other requisites are easily procui-able. Cotton works 
might prosper as well here as at Catrine, the town being as 
favourably situated in regard to all the materials necessary, — coal, 
water, and labourers in abundance; while it has greatly the ad- 
vantage, by enjoying the means of sea as well as of land carriage. 
And we can see nothing to hinder the manufacture of wool in its 
various branches, particularly in the weaving of carpets, from suc- 
ceeding as well in this place as in Kilmarnock, which owes to this 
cause so much of its wealth and prosperity. 

Carpets. — We are glad to have it in our power to bring for- 
ward to view one instance of successful enterprise in the ma- 
nufacturing line in this town, and to hold it up as an example 
of what might be done, on a more extensive scale, with every 
prospect of the happiest results, both as regards the investment 
of money, and the extension of employment among our operative 
population. We allude to the large and thriving establishment of 
Mr Templeton, for the spinning of wool and the manufacture 
of carpets ; and we mention it thus particularly, because it is the

erected , an additional steam engine of forty horse power has been 
ordered , and nearly a hundred more hands will beLquired to e 
establishment, m its various departments. The hours of labour 
and other matters are regulated by the late Act of Parliament in 
egard to manufactories. The carpet-weavers are employed from 
twelve to fourteen hours a day, and being all paid by the pi;ce, they 
can earn about L. 2 in three weeks. A brother of the p/oprietor Jf 
this work carries on a manufactory at what is called the Dutch 
Mill on the Boon, near Burns' monument, for carding, spinning, 
and weaving wool into plaiding or blankets, in which about 30 
hands are employed in and out of the mill. The machinery is all 
wrought by water. This also is a thriving concern, and ha's been 
greatly increased during the last few years. 

Other Produce.—Vnhvhwateh, there are hardly any other ma- 
nufactures belonging to the town or parish, worthy of nodce Shoe- 
making was carried on to a great extent during the war, but it is 
now greatly reduced. There is ope tradesman who still does a good 
deal of business in the export trade in this way, chiefly to the 
British colonies. He employs betwixt 80 and" 100 tradesmen, 
but his orders are mostly from export dealers in Glasgow. There 
are about 200 shoemakers in the town, and upwards of that number, 
probably 250, of hand-loom weavers, who work to orders from' 
manufacturing towns at a distance. In tanning and currying, there 
is also a little business done, and about 20 workmen empSved in 
three separate establishments. The raw material manufactured 
amounts to a few thousand hides and skins annually, which are dis- 
posed of mostly in Ayr, Kilmarnock, and Glasgow. The periods of 
labour are from eight to ten hours in winter, and from ten to twelve 
hours in summer, and the remunerative return for the capital thus 
employed is believed to be encouraging. The flowering and point-

ing of muslin is carried on to a great extent, by agents commission- 
ed from Glasgow, and has proved a great blessing to many fe- 
males in this community. About 300 in this parish are thus em- 
ployed, who earn from 4d. to 2s. per day. There are nine incor- 
porated trades in Ayr, but, with the exception of those above no- 
ticed, the produce of their mechanical labour is chiefly confined 
to the consumption of our own population. 

Ayr Harbour.— The harbour of Ayr appears to have been a port 
for shipping, of as old standing as the town itself. At a very early pe- 
riod of Scotch history, mention is made of ships having been built 
here, by several of the Kings of Scotland ; and in the time of Buch- 
anan, it is described in his history, as " Emporium non igjiobile" A 
serious drawback, however, to its position as a port is formed by a bar 
at its mouth, occasioned by the deposit of alluvial matter brought 
down by the river during floods, as has been already noticed. Much 
has been done, and a great deal of money expended, to lessen this 
obstruction, for its entire removal is probably impracticable. Some 
years ago, a wall of from 20 to 25 feet in height, 8 or 9 feet 
broad at the top, and probably three times as much at the base, 
was carried out into the sea, to the extent of upwards of 300 yards 
on the south side, and more recently another new wall or pier, pa- 
rallel to the other, was constructed on the north side at consider- 
able expense. And it is intended, we understand, to erect a break- 
water still further out than either of these, at the mouth of the en- 
trance into the harbour, according to a plan furnished by an en- 
gineer of competent skill in such matters.f This, if finished, as pro- 
jected, will, it is said, cost about L. 4000. Ordinary spring-tides 
are from 13 to 14 feet of water, and within the bar there is space 
to contain 80 sail. The number of vessels belonging to the port 
is 18, and the amount of tonnage is 2459. The following is a 
state of the income and expenditure for 1836: 

Tonnage dues on vessels, - - L. GB8 5 7 

on goods, - - 1 93 9 8 

Crane dues, fines, &amp;c. - - 19 18 '2 

L. 901 13 5

 We had prepared for this head a short Account of the patent slip in the wood- 
yard of Messrs Cowan and Sloan ; but it is omitted in consequence of our being re- 
minded, that as being placed on the other side of the river, though the proprietors 
and many of the workmen reside here, it more properly belongs to the parish of Now- 
ton-upon-Ayr. 

f Since the above was written, the work has been begun.

This excess of the expenditure above the income during the last

nary expenditure of the harbour amounts to about L. 300 annualt 
includmg salaries to office-bearers, the expense of the light-hou e 
and o cleaning and dredging the river. Several Actsf ParlL:

Trade of the Harbour.— About sixteen vessels arrive annually 
from foreign ports, with cargoes consisting of hemp, mats, tal- 
low, tar, iron, pitch, timber, &amp;c. From twelve to seventeen sail 
to foreign countries with cargoes of coals, cordage, leather, cot- 
ton and woollen goods, &amp;c. There are about 300 vessels, 
coastways, that arrive here from other parts of the United King- 
dom, laden with corn, groceries, haberdasheries, hardware, iron, 
lead, and other general traffick. The quantity of corn brought 
into harbour last year was as follows :— Barley, 318 quarters ; 
beans, 643 do.; peas, 51 do.; oats, 11,145 do.; oatmeal, 5623 
cwt.; wheat-flour, 306 do.; wheat, 3136 quarters. About 1100 
vessels, coastways, have sailed from Ayr to other parts of the 
united kingdom, during the last year, with cargoes consisting of 
coals, corn, wool, and other general goods. The quantity of coals

shipped amounted to betwixt 50,000 and 60,000 tons ; and of grain 
as follows :— Barley, 84 quarters; beans, 183 do.; oats, 87 do. ; 
wheat, 5571 do.; oatmeal, 3178 cwt.; wheat-flour, 5586 do. 

Sheriff-Court of Ayr.— The business of the law constitutes a 
leading profession here. There are twenty-one resident practis- 
ing procurators, besides writers belonging to other towns in the 
county, who have a right to practise. There is, perhaps, no pro- 
vincial law court in Scotland in which business is conducted more 
expeditiously, or less expense is incurred by unnecessary delay in 
obtaining legal decisions, than in the sheriff-court of Ayr. If cases 
are unduly protracted, the fault must be with the law agents, not 
with the sheriffs ; but hardly any complaint of this kind has grounds 
for existence. The ordinary court where cases are conducted by 
written pleadings, is held every Tuesday during session. The winter 
session commences at the latest on the 15th day of October, or first 
ordinary court day thereafter, and continues until the 4th of April 
inclusive, except during the Christmas recess, which is not longer 
than three weeks. The summer session begins on the first court 
day, after the 15th of May, and continues until the last court day in 
July. During the vacations, two days are appointed on which 
papers may be received in process. The number of cases insti- 
tuted before this court during the year 1834 was 431 ; in 1835, 
473 ; in 1 836, 543. Of these, the number advocated to the Court 
of Session was, in 1834, 7; in 1835, 6; in 1836, 4. 

The Small Debt Court, for the disposal of cases where the debt 
does not exceed L. 8, 6s. 8d. is held every Thursday, and parties 
are heard viva voce. The number of cases decided in 1834 was 
1609; in 1835, 1498; in 1836, 1326. The nxxmhev o{ criminal 
cases tried before the sheriff and a jury during the year 1834 was 
16; in 1835, 25; in 1836, 20. The number oi petty criminal 
cases where the punishment concluded for does not exceed sixty 
days imprisonment, that were tried before the sheriff during the 
above periods was, in 1834, 126; in 1835, 88; in 1836, 100. 
There is also a Commissary Court held every week during ses- 
sion, when business requires it, in which the sheriffs are also judges, 
the ordinary presiding judge being the sheriff-substitute. There 
are no separate salaries belonging to it, and the only expenses in- 
curred are to the clerk of the court, and the agents employed. 
There is also a Burgh Criminal Court, in which the magistrates 
preside, as cases happen to come before them ; and a Justice of 
Peace Court is held every Monday morning, for adjusting of debts 
under L. 5, and the trial of minor offences.

has existed ever since. By avoiding the error of its predecessor, 
and steering a prudent medium betwixt rashness and over-caution 
It has turned out a very prosperous concern to all who have been 
connected with it, and as secure and respectable an establishment 
as any other of the kind in our provincial owns. In 1775 a 
branch of the Bank of Scotland was instituted in Ayr, but it has 
never been very extensive in its dealings, and is less so now than 
ever, in consequence of the greater competition in the line that has 
started up of late. It is, however, highly.' respectable, both as re- 
gards Its agents and the jiature of its transactions. A few years 
ago, a new banking establishment was commenced under the name 
of the Ayrshire Banking Company, which has every .ppearanco 
trom the branches belonging to it in the county, of doing business 
to a considerable extent. It is supported by a numerous copartnery, 
and seems to be conducted in a very spirited manner. There is 
also a branch of the Glasgow Union Bank here, so that, with these

four establishments, there is no want of the sinews of commercial 
and industrial enterprise. 

Sailors Society. — This association was instituted so far back as 
the year 1581, for the benefit of decayed mariners, and their widows 
and children after their death. Its records extend to the date of 
its commencement, and to a person capable of decyphering the an- 
tiquated style of handwriting in which they are set down, they 
mioht afford much curious and useful information illustrative of the 
mannei-k of the times, and the local history of the burgh. To ren- 
der them intelligible, however, is fully as difficult a task as to trans- 
late from a dead language. We have had the privilege of perusing 
some extracts from them in modern penmanship, made by one of 
the members now living, who had been at considerable pains in 
penetrating into their contents. The following incident will be 
deemed interesting. In the year 1647, during the prevalence of a 
destructive plague or pestilence, a meeting of the members of the 
society, specially convened, took place, in which, after mentioning 
the names of those present, amounting to a goodly congregation, it 
is thus recorded : " The above-named persons, after serious invo- 
cation of the name of God, publicly by the minister, they apart by 
themselves in the choir of the church, John Osborne beginning 
with prayer, ilk person of them stood up on his feet, and one after 
another, made particular confession of his sins and wickedness, be- 
fore the Majesty of the Great God, and in presence of the people 
then assembled, and did before each of them, their confession with 
prayer, entreating his Majesty to pardon their bygone offences, and 
that he would, for Christ's sake, arrest this present plague of pesti- 
lence, quilk every man in particular acknowledged his sins to be the 
cause of." Among a long list of sins thus confessed, and minutely 
recorded, we find some charging themselves with being guilty of a 
strong inclination, in their travels, after the idolatrous worship of the 
mass, and declaring that " the first thing that made them quat it 
was the swearing of the covenant in this land." Others are repre- 
sented as being guilty of unlawful gain, by alluring and carrying off 
children to the West Indies, from which it would appear that this 
was a crime sometimes practised by mariners at that time. Among 
other irregularities, are confessed with great contrition, swearing, 
blasphemy, drunkenness, incontinence, &amp;c. particularly when ab- 
sent from home, and in foreign parts. It would be strange, at the 
present day, to find members of the sailors' or any other society 
acting a similar part, and putting individually their secret sins upon 
record.

AYRSHIRE. 



Another circumstance of considerable interest in the records of 
this society, is a detail of the expense incurred in building the gal- 
lery in the old church, now known by the name of the Sailors' 
Loft. There is a circumstantial account of all the items of the 
costs incurred,— timber, iron, stone for the pillars, wages, drink to 
the workmen, &amp;c., amounting in all to L. 717, 3s. 2d. Scots, or 
L. 59, 15s. 3d. Sterling. This is dated in May 1655— the year 
following that when the old church was built ; and the measure 
appears to have been entered into in consequence of an act' of the 
town-council authorizing it, and making over to them the right of 
property in the loft. From this we would infer, that the three 
galleries, claimed and held by the sailors, merchants, and trades, 
were appropriated to these public bodies, in consequence of their 
being at the expense of fitting them up for their own use. This 
will be further corroborated by the notice we are about to give of 
the Merchant Company. If, then, Cromwell advanced a sum of 
money for building the church, as is generally asserted and be- 
lieved, it must have been laid out in the stone-work of the edi- 
fice, and fitting up the remaining part of the interior; but the mat- 
ter is doubtful. The members of this society consist now of the 
most respectable and influential of the inhabitants. Its affairs are 
managed at present by twenty-two honorary members, who must 
be owners in part of a square-rigged vessel, and the entry money 
is L. 5, — except to the eldest sons of members, who are only charged 
one guinea for admission. They receive no benefit, except a title to a 
seat in the front of the sailors' gallery, in the Old Church. The 
sum of L. 63, 4s. 6d. was divided lastyear among eighty pensioners. 
Formerly threepence per pound were charged on the wages of sailors 
belonging to the port; butthis has been discontinued, in consequence 
of another association called The Merchant Seamen's Society, being 
established by act of Parliament. Every attempt by the latter to 
unite the two has been resisted by the former, as there exists a 
pride in keeping up as a distinct body, so ancient and respectable 
a fraternity, connected with the port and trade of Ayr. Its only 
revenue now is, the admission money of entrants, the interest of 
L. 11 00 in the hands of the town, L. 45 in Hunter and Company's 
bank, and L. J 2 annually, or upwards, of seat-rents in the sailors' 
loft. 

Merchants' Company. — This Association claims its origin as far 
back as 1665, upwards of seventy years after the commencement 
of the Sailors' Society. It was originally called the Merchant Booth 
Keepers of the Burgh of Ayr, — those who dealt in merchandize

in those days having been in the practice of doing their business 
in open booths, on the sides of the streets. The Company appears 
to have had, for many years, no definite object in view, and was 
constituted about the time of the building of the Old Church, then 
styled the New Church,— the contributing of the merchants to the 
fitting up of the gallery, which still bears their name, having led 
to its formation. It is not shewn from their record book, which 
dates as far back as this period, what was the amount of their con- 
tributions to this object, as in the case of the Sailors' Society, nor 
yet does it appear that at first they were at the expense of finishing 
the whole of the loft. The front seat, and the three or four rows 
of benches immediately behind it, are only mentioned as the pro- 
perty which they claimed in it. It is probable, however, that, in 
proportion as their funds increased, the whole gallery was in time 
fitted up by them, as it has long since become their exclusive pos- 
session. Their funds originally arose wholly out of the sums re- 
ceived as the entry money of members, and the sole privilege which 
the members enjoyed was a right to sittings in the front of the 
loft, the other seats being let indiscriminately at a certain rate for 
each sitting. The seat rent amounted originally to L. 6 Scots 
for a front seat, and L. 3 for back seats, to sons and sons-in- 
law of members, while strangers were charged 20 merks for 
the former, and 1 0 merks for the latter. The admission money 
of members rose by degrees at different periods to L. 1, lis. L. 2, 
L.2, 10s. L.3, L.3, 10s. L.4, 4s. and finally, in 1818, to L.6, 6s. 
Up to the above date, 1818, although the funds had been pro- 
gressively increasing, the Company seem to have had no spe- 
cific object in view in their application, further than giving oc- 
casional aid to decayed members, and indigent widows of mem- 
bers deceased; which, however, was entirely gratuitous on the 
part of the Association, none having any claim to it as a matter of 
right. In 1819, however, a committee was appointed to form a 
scheme for the benefit of decayed members' widows and orphans, 
on a systematic plan, which scheme was adopted on their report 
in 1820, and put in operation. At this period, the capital of the 
company was L. 670, and in 1828, their funds had increased to 
L. 1 140. At present they amount to L. 2000. Besides the re- 
venue arising from the admission-money of entrants, and the year- 
ly contributions of the members, there was the annual produce of 
the seat rents in their loft in the church, which was considerably 
increased, after it was repaired two or three years ago. It is need- 
less to mention here the regulations of the company. It is now 



f2 AYusnniE. 

constituted on a principle somewhat similar to that of insurance 
upon lives, whereby, on paying a certain fixed rate of entry money, 
varying according to the age of the entrant, and that of his wife' 
and an yearly payment afterwards, the widows of deceased mem- 
bers are entitled to an annuity for life, or while they remain un- 
married, and their children also to an yearly allowance, till they 
reach a certain age. It may be stated generally, that the entry 
money is L. 6, 6s. for a person aged twenty years, rising gradually 
till it reaches L. 10, 10s., that being the sum exacted from an en- 
trant of forty years of age. The annual contribution is L. 1, Is. 
to be doubled for the first five years after admission ; and the' an- 
nuity is L. 10. The company form a corporate body, by a seal 
of cause from the magistrates and council, but they enjoy no exclu- 
sive privileges, either mercantile or political. None formerly were 
eligible to be members of it, unless they were burgesses and guild- 
brethren, but this restriction has lately, we believe, been set aside, 
and so has also the allowance before granted to decayed members. 

Incorporated Trades.— T\\eve are nine incorporated trades in 
Ayr, viz. the squaremen, hammermen, tailors, skinners, coopers, 
weavers, shoemakers, dyers, and fleshers. The most numerous 
of these are the squaremen, as they include masons, Wrights, slaters, 
and glaziers. They have all separate royal charters of incorpora- 
tion, with the exception of the coopers and dyers, who had only a 
seal of cause from the magistrates, and they all claim the privileges 
granted to the craftsmen of Scotland, by the charter of Queen Mary 
in 1564. They possess the exclusive right of carrying on their 
separate trades or manufactures within the burgh ; but this confers 
no great privilege, as the right does not extend to the other side 
of the river, where competition with them may exist without their 
control. The chief advantage that they receive arises from the 
aid afforded from their funds to their widows, or to members them- 
selves, when rendered destitute by sickness or old age. The funds 
of some of the trades are considerable, and they are derived prin- 
cipally from the entrance-money of members. They are mostly 
vested in heritable security, and some of them possess valuable 
property of their own. One of the galleries in the Old Church, 
which is called by their name, belongs to the incorporated trades, 
from which, it would appear, that, like the Sailors' Society, and 
Merchants' Company, they also had been at the expense of fitting 
up a loft for themselves, at the time when the church was erected. 
This loft has lately been thoroughly repaired and new seated at 



AYR. ' 



their joint expense, and a large handsome- window, with an edging 
of stained glass, opened up at the west end, which has a fine eftect. 
The front seat is allotted to the convener, and the deacons ot the 
different incorporations, and formerly the benches behind were 
filled with tradesmen and their apprentices indiscriminately. 1 his, 
to strangers, had rather a novel appearance, by exhibiting a dense 
congregated mass of men, without any mixture of females. Smce 
the gallery has been repaired, however, one-half of it has been 
formed into pews, and let to tradesmen and their families at an 
annual seat rent, which assimilates it more to the portions occu- 
pied by other parts of the congregation. The other half is appro- 
priated, as before, to tradesmen, journeymen, and apprentices, who 
choose to sit there. Several of the trades have separate widows' funds 
of their own, which it is optional on the members to enter or not, as 
they may feel inclined, and the annual payments vary from Is. to 
8s. The ulterior benefits derived from them, of course, bear a 
similar proportion. The convener's board of deacons are respec- 
tively chosen by the corporations, and have a general superintend- 
ence of what concerns them as a united body, each retaining the 
separate management of its own affairs. 

Writers Society.— Th\s association was called originally " The 
Fraternity of Procurators in Ajr ;" but the period when it com- 
menced cannot now be ascertained. Its records extend no further 
back than 1710; but that it was in existence before that time, 
these records themselves seem evidently to intimate. It then con- 
sisted of eight or ten members ; and its object was, to provide a 
fund for the relief of their wives and children after their decease, 
and also for themselves in case of indigence. So far back as the 
record-book extends, the dues of admission were five merks from 
each apprentice to one of the fraternity, and ten pounds Scots on 
his admission as a member, while those who had not served with 
one of the society, paid one hundred merks Scots, the entry-money 
being the same in both cases. In 1710, the funds of the society 
amounted to only one hundred merks, and, along with the interest, 
were disposed of from time to time, according to the pleasure of 
the members, there being no definite object in view. But in the 
year 1772, the funds having accumulated to L. 243, 18s. lid. 
Sterling, it was agreed that each member should make an annual 
contribution of a guinea, besides other small occasional payments, 
so as to enable the society to give a reasonable annuity to the 
wives and children of deceased members. The annuity was fixed 



64 



AYRSHIRE. 



at L. 10 Sterling, and continued so till the year 1818. In con- 
sequence of this annuity, the admission dues were raised to L. 5, 
to be paid by those who should serve with members, and to L. 15 
to such as should be apprenticed elsewhere. At the same time, 
the entry-money was made to consist of two rates, which were 
raised progressively, first, to L. 20 and L. 40 ; second, to L. 25 
and L. 45 ; and, third, to L. 40 and L. 80. Besides this and the 
annual contribution of a guinea, it was agreed that each mem- 
ber who wished to augment the annuity to the extent of L. 20 
above the ordinary rate, should contribute L. 1, 10s. for five 
years in addition to his annual payments, and this to commence 
in 1818. In 1820, it was resolved to admit none into the so- 
ciety but such as had served their apprenticeship with members 
residing in Ayr, and the entry-money was then fixed to be L. 54, 
10s., and the annuities to be L. 50 after 1825. Owing, however, 
to the interest of money having fallen, and the unexampled num- 
ber of widows who had become a burden on the funds, the an- 
nuity has never been more than L. 40, but it is continued to chil- 
dren till they be eighteen years of age. There are at present 
twenty-four members belonging to the society, but five of these 
do not reside in Ayr, and four do not practise before the Sheriff- 
court. Their funds in 1836 amounted to L. 7434, 6s. 2id. ; but 
there were no fewer than eleven widows deriving annuities, and 
one decayed member, who receives L. 20 yearly. Three of the 
widows get L. 10 each annually, their husbands having died pre- 
vious to 1818, and the other eight receive the balance of the in- 
terest and the contributions, the society having resolved in no case 
to encroach on the capital. The annuity to decayed members is 
now abolished. There was, till of late, a sinking fund of L. 50 a- 
year ; but that is at present suspended, till the existing burdens 
be diminished. The admission dues are fixed at two guineas at 
the commencement of apprenticeship, or, in lieu thereof, five gui- 
neas on becoming a member, — besides L. 78 of entry-money, and 
one guinea of annual contribution. 

Ayrshire Horticultural and Agricultural Society. — This society, 
which at first was only horticultural, was formed in 1815; and 
its object was to promote and encourage horticulture, in all its 
branches, throughout the county. It consisted of about sixty 
members, and was under the management of a president, vice- 
preses, and six counsellors. The late Earl of Eglinton was the 

first president and patron of the institution. At the annual com- 

1. 



AYR. 



05 



petitions, prizes were awarded for the best specimens of fruits, 
flowers, and vegetables, and for several years the society was con- 
ducted with great spirit, and proved highly conducive to the object 
for which it was formed. There is a library, which was com- 
menced in 1824, consisting of books on horticulture, botany, na- 
tural history, &amp;c. ; and at this period it contains about a hundred 
volumes. In the year 1831, there was a splendid exhibition, on 
a large scale, of all the productions of the vegetable kingdom that 
useful and ornamental gardening could furnish, —specimens of 
these, both rich and rare, having been brought forward from dif- 
ferent parts of the county, by practical gardeners and amateurs. 
This interesting show was among the first of the kind in Scotland, 
and was the means of gaining high repute to the institution, and 
of procuring for it many additional members. In 1832, the as- 
sociation united with it most of the agriculturists of the district, 
and from this period took the name of The Ayrshire Horticul- 
tural and Agricultural Society" and six additional councillors were 
added to the former number. In 1833 and 1834, there were ex- 
hibitions of all sorts of produce belonging to the two branches of 
the institution. It seems to be conducted in a spirited manner, 
and cannot fail to be useful, by exciting emulation, and a more 
intimate communion among two most respectable classes, closely 
allied to each other in their professional pursuits. 

Ayr Medical Association. — A Society under the above designa- 
tion has existed among medical practitioners since 1830, for 
mutual instruction and professional communication. It consists 
of almost the whole of the gentlemen belonging to the profession 
in the town, and of several in other parts of the county. Each of 
the members contributes one sovereign annually to the funds which 
are expended in the purchase of books and journals, chiefly of a 
professional character. Thus the periodical medical literature of 
Britain, and of foreign countries, and works of merit which are 
from time to time issued from the press on subjects connected 
with the profession, are in constant circulation among the mem- 
bers. This renders the association the more useful, as such pro- 
ductions could not be so conveniently procured otherwise, not being 
admissible into libraries intended for general readers. The books 
are kept at present at the Dispensary rooms, where all the mem- 
bers can easily avail themselves of them. We take this oppor- 
tunity of paying a well-marked tribute of respect to the medical

gentlemen of Ayr. They care about a dozen in number, and they 
are not less distinguished as a body for their disinterested huma- 
nity to the poor, than they are for urbanity of manners, and hte- 
rary and professional attainments. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Internal Communication. — Ayr is the only town in the parish, 
and there is no collection of houses in the country district, of such 
extent as even to deserve the name of village. But there is no 
provincial town that enjoys more amply the means and facilities of 
communication with other places, both by sea and land. There are 
regular packets and traders from the harbour, to Liverpool, Glas- 
gow, Dublin, &amp;c. at all times of the year ; and in summer, steam- 
boats sail betwixt this and Glasgow every day, communicat- 
ing with the other towns along the coast. A steam-boat sails also 
every Saturday to Stranraer, touching at Ayr, and returns on the 
Monday following, thereby affording the means of conveyance to and 
from Ireland. There are arrivals of the mail from London once, 
and from Glasgow and Edinburgh twice, every day, and depart- 
ures as often, and a mail-coach has lately been started from Glas- 
gow for L-eland, through Ayr, which affords a great convenience 
to the whole of this western district. A traveller has it in his 
power to go from this to Edinburgh by coach, at five different 
times every lawful day, and to arrive in Ayr from the east by near- 
ly as many opportunities. An Edinburgh coach runs daily by 
Loudon hill, Strathaven, &amp;c. thus opening up a district of country 
with which there was formerly little communication. There are 
also coaches twice a-week or oftener, to all the inland towns in the 
district, of any note, Irvine, Maybole, Girvan, Cumnock, and Dal- 
mellington ; and through the last, there is a regular stage-coach 
thrice every week to Dumfries during the summer months. The 
roads in the parish are kept in excellent order, as there is a su- 
perintendent with a liberal salary, appointed by the trustees to pre- 
serve them in proper condition. There is a plan going forward 
at present, to form a rail-road betwixt Ayr and Glasgow, and an- 
other betwixt Glasgow and Edinburgh, &amp;c. which will render the 
means of conveyance still more expeditious and easy, both for pas- 
sengers and goods. The money necessary for this great and im- 
portant undertaking has been already subscribed in shares, and 
the sanction of Parliament is only wanted to commence the work, 
which will certainly tend in many ways to the advantage of Ayr, 



AYR. 



G7 



as well as the county generally, both in the way of trade and tra- 
velling. 

Ecclesiastical State.— Ayr has been a collegiate charge since the 
days of Queen Mary, who made provision for a second minister. 
As to the junction of Alloway parish, there is almost nothing dis- 
tinctly known, in regard to the mode or the terms by which it was ef- 
fected ; there being Httle or nothing mentioned about it in the records 
of the town about that time, nor in those of the kirk-session. We 
have already stated that it took place about the end of the seven- 
teenth century, and that the stipend, amounting only to L. 32, 
with the teind all exhausted, was divided -equally betwixt the two 
ministers of Ayr. The glebe was annexed to the second charge, 
for no other reason that can be discovered, than that the first liv- 
ing had been previously provided with one. This glebe was feued 
along with the lands of Alloway, by the magistrates, with the con- 
sent of the presbytery, and yields only the yearly sum of L. 3, 6s. 8d. 
there having been no more than the statutory extent. No provi- 
sion seems to have been made, as in some other junctions of a simi- 
lar kind, for having divine service performed at Alloway, and indeed 
there was little cause, the distance from Ayr to where the old 
church stands being little more than two miles. The same rea- 
son as to distance, however, would apply still more forcibly as to 
the union of Monkton and Prestwick, when it was stipulated to 
have public worsliip performed at the latter place every third Sab- 
bath, though the distance betwixt them is scarcely a mile. But 
the case was very different with respect to Ayr, where the magis- 
trates were the only party having power in the matter ; whereas in 
the other case, there were different bodies to treat with. But, in 
fact, it is impossible to say whether there had been any thing of 
this kind stipulated for or not, as the decree of annexation by the 
Court of Teinds has either been lost, or purposely withheld, since 
no such deed could ever be made forthcoming. We have heard 
that the Ayr ministers continued to preach in Alloway, every third 
Sabbath, for some time after the union of the parishes; but whe- 
ther this was voluntary, or by positive stipulation, cannot now be 
ascertained. If the latter had been the case, it is not likely that 
the practice could have been so easily relinquished. For a long 
period after the junction, the old church of Ayr seems to have been 
perfectly adequate to accommodate the whole population of the

two parishes. But towards the end of the last century, the want 
of church room began to be seriously felt, there having been very 
few Dissenters in the place, and hardly any dissenting places of 
worship. Before the new church was built, t-he demand for sit- 
tings in the old church became so great, that a single pew would 
cost a sura that would be considered extravagant at the present 
day. What added to their value, and the difficulty of obtaining 
seat room was, that the galleries had become appropriated to dif- 
ferent corporations, to which they continue to belong at this day. 
Hence the demand for pews was such, in the disposable part of the 
church, that the most of them were purchased as private proper- 
ty by the more wealthy classes, and still continue to be so held. 
Accordingly, many who, from these causes, could not procure ac- 
commodation in their own parish church, were under the necessity 
of obtaining it in the church of Newton-upon-Ayr, or elsewhere ; 
to which they have mostly since adhered, when otherwise they would 
in all probability have continued to receive instruction from their 
own parish ministers. 

The macfistrates committed two material errors in regard to the 
building of the new church, the consequences of which have 
continued to be seriously felt ever since. The first was, their not 
having erected it at an earlier period, in order to supply timeuusly 
the existing wants of the people for seats, and thus prevent them 
from seekinor them elsewhere. The second consisted in their not 
allowing or soliciting the proprietors of land to bear their share in 
the expense, which, it is said, they would willingly have done, in 
order to provide suitable church accommodation for their tenantry. 
Ayr, in this respect, differs from all other parishes in Scotland that 
have landed districts, and it is owing, perhaps, to the magistrates 
having been once the sole proprietors. Not a single tenant on any 
of the estates into which the parish has been now subdivided, can 
claim seats for himself and family, as belonging to his farm, and 
not a landlord has it in his power to serve his tenantry with seat 
room in the same church with himself, in return for the stipend 
which is paid to their parish ministers. There is thus a want of 
those most sacred of all ties betwixt them that can bind men to- 
gether, both as public bodies and as individuals. There is no lack 
of unoccupied seats in the new church ; they may be had by such 
as choose to pay for them; and yet, the proprietors of land, who cer- 
tainly have no disinclination to accommodate their farmers in this 
respect, are put out of the way of doing so, from having no right

of property In the building. In the old church, the seats are all 
let or nearly so, and in some parts belonging to incorporated 
bodies, which have been lately repaired, there are more demands 
for sittings than can be supplied. The attendance here is always 
numerous and respectable. It was built in 1654, and the new 
church in 1810. Both are capable of accommodatmg from 2UUU 
to 2500 sitters, and there are about 1000 communicants or upwards 
at each sacrament,— this ordinance being dispensed twice a~year. 
There is no want of church accommodation at present in the pa- 
rish, and a considerable number of sittings have been set apart for 
the poor by the magistrates, some entirely gratis, and others at 
such low rates as to make them easily accessible to the most indi- 

There is a meeting- house in this parish, belonging to the Rehet 
body of Dissenters, another to the Moravians, and a third to the 
Methodists ; but the congregations of the two last are small, and 
that of the Relief is made up of people from six or eight parishes. 
There are various other Dissenters who have phices of worship on 
the other side of the river, and numbers belonging to them in the 
parish of Ayr. The following tables, the result of a survey made in 
1836, will exhibit in one distinct view, the population belonging to 
the Established Church, and also to the Dissenting denominations.

The stipend of the first charge consists of eight chalders and 
a-half, half meal, and half bear, and one-half chalder for com- 
munion elements. The incumbent has, besides, the half of the 
yearly interest of L. 1 000, bequeathed to the two ministers of Ayr, 
by John Fergusson, Esq. of Doonholm, and the half, of the sti- 
pend of Alloway, amounting to L. 16 odds yearly. He has a com- 
fortable manse, which was built a few years ago, after a long and 
tedious litigation with the magistrates and heritors to obtain it, 
which cost a very large amount of expenses, and which was de- 
cided ultimately in his favour by the House of Lords. The sti- 
pend of the second minister is made up partly of the old stipend 
of the second charge, partly of a sum from the Government 
Bounty, and partly of an allowance from the magistrates for extra 
service, and the half of the above-mentioned bequest, together 
with L. 46, 13s. 4d. in heu of a manse and glebe. The ordinary 
collections at the church doors amount to upwards of L. 100 an- 
nually; and the extraordinary, to nearly as much, including cmitri- 
butions made every winter for coals to the poor, and money re- 
ceived for them at the two sacraments. The ordinary collections 
are diminishing gradually every year, in consequence of the high 
rate of assessment. There are a Bible, Missionary, Tract, Tem- 
perance, Sabbath School, and Female Benevolent Society in the 
town ; but the amount of their funds, individually or collectively, 
cannot easily be ascertained. We have occasional collections in 
the parish churches for objects of Christian benevolence, such as 
the General Assembly's Schools in the Highlands, the Church 
of Scotland Mission in India, and additional Church accommo- 
dation, which may increase our extraordinary collections to a 
larger sum annually than we have stated it above ; but the for- 
mer is regular, the latter only contingent. Our churches are both 
situated in the town, and are convenient enough for the great body 
of the people, though some miles distant from the furthest boun- 
dary of the parish. 

Education — Academy. — There are few places better provided 
with the means of education than Ayr. In 1798, the parochial 



AYR. 71 



schools of the burgh were formed into an academy, and a charter 
obtained from the King, uniting the managers and directors mto 
one body corporate, with power to enact laws for then- own re- 
gulation. What formed the germ of this institution was the 
sum of L. 1000, which was bequeathed for behoof of the pub- 
lic teachers of Ayr, by Mr Fergusson of Doonholm, already 
mentioned. A considerable sum additional was obtained by sub- 
scriptions from the town, the heritors, and various wealthy indivi- 
duals in the county and elsewhere, every L. 50 constituting the 
contributor a director of the academy. By means of these sums, 
a handsome building was erected for teachers' apartments, and 
a fund formed for the payment of their salaries, and the sup- 
port of the seminary. Its success has fully equalled the most 
sanguine expectations that were formed of it. It has secured a re- 
putation not surpassed by that of any other institution of the kind 
in Scotland. The teaching department is conducted by a rector, 
and five other principal teachers, besides an assistant in the Eng- 
lish school. The rector has a salary of L. 100 a year ; the other 
masters have small salaries, the highest not exceeding L. 22, 
and depend chiefly for their emoluments on fees from their pu- 
pils. These fees vary from five shillings to a guinea a quarter, 
but few of the branches taught exceed half a guinea, and the most 
common are only charged at the lowest rate we have named. 
The following is a list of the branches of education in the dif- 
ferent departments, viz. mathematics, natural philosophy, che- 
mistry, geography, natural history, English composition, modern 
languages, Latin and Greek, writing and drawing, arithmetic, 
book-keeping, and navigation, and English, English grammar, and 
history. The numbers that attend the academy in the course of 
each year average about 500, and this average has continued pret- 
ty uniform for . many years back, notwithstanding that similar in- 
stitutions have greatly increased throughout the country, and even 
in towns not far distant. The teachers are gentlemen of distin- 
guished talents and attainments,— they live and act together in 
great harmony ; and the seminary, being under a liberal system of 
management, has generally continued, since its commencement, in 
a prosperous and efficient state." It has been of great benefit to 
the town in different ways, —for instance, by attracting families to 
reside in it for education, and by transfusing a spirit of intelli- 
gence and enlightened thinking among its Inhabitants. 

There are about a dozen of other schools in the parish besides 



72 



AYRSHIRE. 



the Academy, at all of which the numbers taught yearly mav 
amount to betwixt 600 and 700. The teachers of all of these, 
with the exception of Smith's Institutipn, depend entirely on 
school fees for their emolumert, and chiefly the common branches 
of education are taught in them. There are also two private 
schools for the country part of the parish ; and none of the inha- 
bitants are so far distant from school as to be excluded from the 
benefit of education. There are few, if anv, of the native popu- 
lation who cannot read ; and parents are attentive enouo-h to have 
their children educated, with the exception, perhaps, as we have 
said, of some of the poorer class of Irish labourers, who have not 
been educated themselves, and who are in a very degraded state 
as to civihzation. With the numbers, then, attending the Aca- 
demy and the other schools in the town, taken collectively, we have 
thus an average amount of upwards of 1100 in the coJrse of re- 
ceiving education from year to year, making a proportion of betwixt 
a sixth and a seventh part of the population, and, we presume, there 
are but few other parishes now in Scotland that can boast of a 
greater proportion. 

Libraries.—There are two circulating libraries in the town, 
one of which is conducted on rather an extensive and liberal scale, 
as there are admitted into it, not only novels, but also the more 
popular and fashionable productions of the day, besides the stan- 
dard periodical works. We have also a pretty extensive town li- 
 brary, containing a very good selection of books of standard merit, 
amounting to 3000 volumes. The terms of admission, however, 
are too high to render it so generally useful as it might have been 
to the inhabitants. Until of late, the fixed entry- money was L. 5. 
It is now reduced to L. 3, which is still too high a rate for laying 
It open to the public. The consequence has been, that the num- 
ber of its members, viz. 108, has remained nearly the same at this 
day as when it received its charter from the town in 180S. It was 
intended originally as a library for a select society of gentlemen, 
who commenced it so far back as 1762, and it has continued 
pretty much so ever since. We do not find huh with this, but 
with the bad policy of the system, and its having been so 
long shut up from more general access. Had the admission 
money been L. 1, in all probabihty it would have contained 
five or six times the amount of books that it does at present, 
besides being, to an equal extent, a greater public benefit. 
It would be easy to establish this by the history of other public 



AYR. 



73 



libraries. This affords one instance among many, that when 
an institution sets out at first on a wrong principle, it is ex- 
ceedingly difficult afterwards to get it rectified. 

Neiospapers. — There are two county newspapers published week- 
ly in Ayr ; the one on Thursday, the other on Tuesday. '1 he 
Advertiser is of long standing, and of Whig politics; the Ob- 
server is Conservative, though conducted in a very moderate and 
judicious manner. They both appear to thrive, as they circulate 
over a very extensive iand populous district, which contains a people 
much given to reading. — We have also a handsome well-lighted 
reading-rpom, where newspapers and periodicals are to be found 
in abundance, suited to all tastes and opinions, and where the ut- 
most order and quietness are maintained. 

Mechanics Institution. — The observation we lately made in re- 
gard to the town library has received a forcible exemplification 
from the progress of that of the mechanics. It was only instituted 
in 1825, and since that time it has been rapidly increasing, both 
in extent and utility. It contains already 2500 volumes of well- 
selected books, nearly as many as the other, and has from 150 to 
200 members. These pay only six shillings a year each, thus 
forming a fund for the purchase of new publications, of upwards 
of L. 40 per annum. The library has been greatly augmented of 
late, by liberal donations from private individuals. Lectures on 
scientific subjects are occasionally delivered to the mechanics, and 
they probably would be continued in a more regular and systema- 
tic form, were it not for the want of a suitable lecture-room. We 
trust this may soon be found, for the benefit of this useful and re- 
spectable class of our fellow-townsmen, and the success of their 
very laudable institution. 

Charitable Institutions — Poor's House. — There is a poor's house 
or hospital in the town, which was built in the year 1759, with 
• sums contributed by the magistrates and other public bodies. It is 
stated in the last Statistical Account, that, at the time when it was 
built, it was capable of accommodating about sixty inmates, young 
and old. The number now admitted into it seldom exceeds twenty- 
five, and is commonly about twenty. These consist of persons 
not merely destitute, but entirely unable to take care of themselves, 
and who, but for this establishment, would require to be entrusted to 
the charge of nurses, at an expense additional to their aliment. 
Were it not on this account, it would be of little use to the town 
for behoof of the poor, as the latter prefer living in houses of their 



74 



ARYRSHIRE. 



own on a fixed rate of aliment, and every inmate in the house 
costs on an average 2s. 6d. per week, which exceeds the average 
allowance to out-door pensioners. There is a master and mistress, 
who have apartments provided for them in the institution, besides 
a fixed salary of L, 30 to the former, who acts also as clerk to 
the directors; and L.20 to the latter, yearly. And a large un- 
occupied room, not now required for the poor, is used as a school 
at present, for the instruction of the children attending Smith's 
Institution, where the children of paupers are taught gratis. 

Management of the Poor.— The directors of this establishment 
the poor's house having now become the managers of the poor 
generally of the town and parish, it may be proper to explain brief- 
ly the nature of the constituency, and its mode of working, in or- 
der to enable strangers to form some idea as to how the poor are 
regulated and provided for in Ayr. At the time when the poor's 
house was built, and for a long time after, its directors, and the 
kirk-session, formed two separate bodies, each having a list of poor 
to provide for from different funds. Those of the session were de- 
rived from the weekly church collections, the rent of the farm of 
Session-field, and the emoluments arising from some mortifications. 
Those of the poor's house managers consisted of an annual con- 
tribution from the different corporate bodies which they represent- 
ed, and a small yearly assessment on the inhabitants. This mode 
of providing for the poor, by the agency of two distinct parties, 
came to be exceedingly inconvenient and liable to abuses, as it 
often happened that paupers received aliment from both, without 
the knowledge of either. Accordingly, about twenty years ago, 
in making some necessary reforms on the poor's house establish- 
ment, it was deemed expedient to unite both bodies, with their re- 
spective funds, under one common interest and system of manage- 
ment ; which was done by constituting the whole members of the 
kirk-session poor's house directors, and appointing a joint treasur- 
er to receive their united funds. The session, in addition to the 
two ministers, consists of upwards of twenty elders, who have each 
a district of the town allotted to his superintendence. The di- 
rectors of the poor's house, before the junction, consisted of nine 
from the town-council, eight from the incorporated trades, the 
sailors, merchants, and writers, sending three each, making in all 
twenty-six. To this number have been added, besides the session, 
all the landed proprietors of the parish whose rental yearly amounts 
to L.50 and upwards, of whom there are about twelve,— thus form- 



AYR. 



75 



ing a constituency in toto of about sixty members, to whom the 
management of the poor is entrusted. These hold their ordmary 
meetings once a quarter, to determine on appUcations from paupers, 
and transact any other business that may occur. There is besides 
a standing committee for conducting the minor details of busmess. 
A superintendent of poor with a fixed salary acts under the direc- 
tors, to investigate and report as to every petition for aliment, which 
must have the sanction and signature of the elder of the quarter 
to which the petitioner belongs, to scrutinize the claims of every 
pauper, to conduct the correspondence respecting doubtful or dis- 
puted cases, and to direct the officers employed in the suppression 
of begging. 

Poor's Funds.— The funds for the support of the poor are made 
up of the collections received at the two churches after deducting 
the necessary expenses of the session, the annual rent of the farm 
of Sessionfield, interest on mortifications, sixty-four bolls of meal,— 
the proceeds of a purchase made long ago by the magistrates, and 
gifted to the poor's house, — and a general assessment on the inhabi- 
tants, proportioned to their means. The meal above-mentioned is 
derived from certain lands on the estate of Fullarton, and arose out 
of the endowment granted by King Robert Bruce to the support of 
the hospital of Kincase or Kingscase, in the vicinity of Ayr, erected 
by him for the reception and cure of lepers, a disease which appears 
to have been prevalent in his time. After the cessation of the 
establishment, the endowment had fallen into the possession of the 
Wallaces of Craigie, and was purchased at a judicial sale by Mr 
Richard Campbell, writer in Edinburgh. By him it was sold with 
all its rights and perquisites to the magistrates of Ayr in 1786, for 
L. 300, with the royal charter and disposition in right thereof, and 
by them the meal was made over to the poor's house, — they, how- 
ever, securing to themselves in virtue of it, the privilege of nomi- 
nating a certain number of inmates to be supported in that institu- 
tion, or rather the purchase being coupled with this provision. 
The expenditure for the poor last year amounted to L. 1064, 7s. 8d. 
and the income to L. 1 100. The number of regular out-pensioners 
on the roll amounts to about 300, of whom by far the greater pro- 
portion consists of women and children. The allowance granted to 
each varies from 6d. to 3s. weekly. The disease of cholera was 
very severe while it lasted in this town, not only in regard to the 
numbers who fell victims to it, but in its elfects afterwards, which 
are still felt at this day, because many were made widows and 



16 



AVRSHlllP]. 



orphans, left destitute and helpless, and rendered a heavy bur- 
den on- the parish. The expenses of the Board of Health, dur- 
ing its prevalence, amounted to L. 742, 3s. of which L, 165, 1.3s. 
were raised by subscription, and L. 576, 10s. by an extra assess- 
ment. In addition to this, the ordinary assessment for the year that 
followed was necessarily raised from L. 570 to L. 950, and al- 
though some reduction has taken place of this heavy burden, yet 
the directors have never been able, with their utmost efforts, to 
bring it back to any thing near to what it previously was. It may 
possibly be thought by some, from the system of directorship which 
we have exhibited above, that we have deviated too much from 
Scotch parochial simplicity in our management of the poor, and 
that the machinery is too complex to admit of vigorous efficiency. 
Whether it be so or not, we shall not take upon us to decide, but 
it is proper to mention, that all who have a share in this manage- 
ment are alike anxious to lessen the evil and the grievous burden 
which pauperism has entailed on this parish. The following state 
will exhibit in one view the progress of the assessment since the be- 
ginning of the present century ; and we shall mention only the 
years when any alteration took place.

Dispensary. — This very useful institution was formed in the 
year 1817, and it has proved a blessing to many thousands of the 
poor of the community, by administering medical advice and relief 
gratuitously to all labouring under disease, or requiring surgical 
aid, whose means could not enable them to pay the usual fees of 
a medical practitioner. In fact, it may be regarded as the most 
beneficial establishment of the place. Upwards of 500 yearly are 
enrolled on the list of its patients — every subscriber to the amount 
of 5s. annually being entitled to recommend one to participate 
of its benefits. It comprehends within its sphere the three parishes 
of Ayr, Newton, and Wallacetown, and it has been hitherto sup- 
ported wholly by voluntary contributions. The average expendi- 
ture amounts to more than L. 100 a-year, but this has as yet been 
met by the income arising from subscriptions and donations ; and 
so sensible are the community in general of its usefulness, that an 
extension of their liberality could doubtless be easily procured to 
supply any deficiency of funds. Five medical gentlemen in Ayr 
at present officiate as surgeons ; and the whole of the three parishes 



AYR. 77 



have been divided into five districts, each taking the charge of one 
of these in rotation for a year. Cow-pox inoculation is perform- 
ed at all times at the dispensary-house ; and such of the patients 
as cannot attend there are waited on at their own houses by the 
surcreon of their district. It is in contemplation to add to it a 
medical hospital, and a considerable sum has been subscribed for 
this purpose. It is hoped that, ere long, this intention may be 

Smith's l7istitution.— This is another of the very useful chari- 
table establishments of the town. The following is shortly its his- 
tory. About twenty years ago, a school was instituted for the edu- 
cation of poor children, according to the system of Bell and Lan- 
caster, and a list of annual contributors was obtained for its sup- 
port. A teacher was accordingly appointed, and the seminary 
throve as well as could have been expected. This, however, 
was superseded a few years ago by the bequest of a Captain 
Smith of this place, who, after leaving certain legacies, de- 
voted the residue of a small fortune, which he had acquired as a 
mariner, to the humane purpose of benefiting the poor of Ayr, by 
affording them the means of education to their children. As the 
provisions of his will to this effect embraced exactly the objects 
which the subscribers had in view by the Lancasterian school, the 
proceeds of the bequest, amounting to about L. 2000, were dedi- 
cated to the support of said school under a new name, viz. Smith's 
Institution, and the former subscriptions were discontinued. The ma- 
gistrates and ministers are appointed trustees ; and they meet once 
a quarter to inspect the school, and transact any business that may 
occur connected with it. The number of those constantly attending 
the seminary amounts to from 150 to 200, and of those who receive 
instruction in it in the course of the year, to about 250. Such as 
are unable to pay are admitted gratis. The rest pay at the rate 
of a penny a-week. The school, as we have said, is taught in the 
poor's-house ; but it is in contemplation to erect a separate build- 
ing in some convenient situation, for a teaching-room. 

There is also a School of Industr;/, for teaching young girls sew- 
ing and other simple quahfications, for fitting them to become use- 
ful domestic servants. About 50 of the poorer class are instruct- 
ed in this manner, many of whom are receiving their education at 
the same time at Smith's Institution ; and, we believe, the pro- 
duce of their work is sufficient to support the school. 

Savings Bank. — In 1815, a Saving's Bank was instituted by a 



78 



AYRSHIRE. 



few influential gentlemen in this town, for the parishes of Ayr, 
Newton, and that populous district of St Quivox, named Wallace- 
town, which has now been erected into a separate parish by itself. 
The same plan was adopted as that laid down by the Rev. Dr 
Duncan, the original inventor, and the undertaking was brought 
to a successful issue by the indefatigable exertions of Mr Cowan, 
banker, then Provost of Ayr. A subscription was obtained of up- 
wards of L. 400, of which only two and a half per cent, was col- 
lected, to provide for expenses, and the remainder, which was never 
called for, stood over as a fund for the security of the establish- 
ment. The subscribers only were made eligible as directors, and 
the depositors themselves have been excluded from all share in the 
management. The bank is open once a week, viz. every Monday 
morning, to receive any sums that may be offered from Is. to 
L. 10. When the deposits reach this last sum, the contributor is 
obliged to withdraw his money and dispose of it elsewhere. The 
number of open accounts is at present 700, and the sum due by 
the bank is L. 3320. In 1822, there were only 358 open accounts, 
and the sum annually deposited continued, with little variation, at 
about L. 1100 per annum for twelve years, when, in 1828, there 
was an increase to L. 1 700 per annum of deposits, and of ninety 
additional open accounts. Since that period, the deposits and ac- 
counts stand as follows :

The total number of accounts opened since the commencement of 
this bank to this date is 3613, and the total amount of money paid in 
small sums is, L. 30,017, 14s. 3d., which may be regarded as an ex- 
cess of labour and of wages above what is required for the conveni- 
ences and necessaries of life. It is impossible to estimate to their full 
extent the great moral as well as temporal benefits that are calculat- 
ed to accrue to the labouring classes from such an institution as 
this, of which, as above, they appear to avail themselves so exten- 
sively. A great proportion of the depositors consists of apprentices 
and servant girls, who are thus inured to habits of economy, pru- 
dence, and foresight, while they lay up in store besides, a small 
fund, wliich they will find of incalculable advantage for their future 



AYR.

establishment in life, either in the way of marriage or of trade. A 
person who carefully manages his savings in this way, will general- 
ly be found to stand aloof from those thoughtless follies and ex- 
cesses which prove hurtful to so many of the young, on their 
setting out in the world; and he will run no great risk of falling 
into improvident indigence in old age, and thereby becoming a 
burden on his friends or the public. We look upon savings banks 
as of far more advantage to the lower orders than benefit societies, 
as the latter often fall into decay from want of proper calculation 
of their resources, and the pressure of demands that are hable to 
be made upon them by contingencies of sickness, against which 
they sometimes become unable to provide. The former, however, 
are as steady and secure as any regular bank, and the money sav- 
ed in this way is always available at pleasure. The interest allow- 
ed to money deposited in the Ayr savings bank, has varied at dif- 
ferent periods. The bank of Messrs Hunters and Co. in which it 
is lodged, allows one-half per cent, more than the current interest. 
Formerly it was at the rate of 6d. for every 12s. ; lately, it has 
been reduced to 6d. for every L. 1, or two and a-half per 
cent, annually. In 1820 its rules received the approval of the 
general sessions of the county of Ayr, in terms of the act of 
Parliament passed anent savings banks in Scotland, which entitled 
this bank to certain privileges. In terms of the act, they can lend 
their funds in bond without stamps, and are not subject to any ad- 
vertisement duty. The directors, however, have never as yet 
availed themselves of these privileges. 

Friendly Societies. — Various societies of this description have 
long existed here, and, notwithstanding the decay and dissolution 
of several, they still continue to keep their ground, and new ones 
start up as others disappear. The general principle on which 
they are all founded is, that every member, by contributing a small 
pittance of his earnings weekly, while in health and able to work, 
shall be entitled, during temporary sickness or old age, to have a 
fixed weekly allowance. ■ This allowance is greater or smaller in 
different societies, according to the rate of their contributions ; 
but we fear there is something necessarily unfixed and liable to 
prove deceptive, as regards them all, in consequence of their be- 
ing so much dependent on circumstances that are, and always 
must be, contingent. Insurance upon lives can be reduced to a 
pretty accurate standard, by calculations on mortality on a large 
scale, but it is quite a different thing to form a fixed and ac- 



80 



AYRSHIRE. 



curate estimate in regard to temporary disease on a small scale, 
its extent of prevalence, and length of duration. Let us take as 
instances the disease of cholera and that of influenza, whose wide- 
spreading ravages over the whole community will long be remem- 
bered ; — though the latter, is not to be compared to the former in 
point of destructiveness, yet, as being more recent, it is at pre- 
sent more impressive. Who could possibly foresee the prevalence 
of these, or form any calculation as to their effects, and yet the 
stability of friendly societies depends much on such contingencies. 
If their funds are large, and well economized by a continuance of 
general good health among the members, they may be able to keep 
their ground, but this would hardly be possible with limited re- 
sources, and a great proportion of the contributors reduced to the 
necessity of requiring weekly aliment. Accordingly, such seasons 
of pressure have, from time to time, upset numbers; but that they 
are not so fluctuating as might be supposed, may be seen from the 
following list of those now existing for the parishes of Ayr, New- 
ton, and Wallacetown, exhibiting the dates of their commencement, 
and the sums they have respectively disbursed.

The re are also several Female Societies in Ayr, conducted on the 
same principle, and among the rest we may notice that called Lady 
Craivford's, of long standing, and which has done a great deal of 
good among indigent females. It derived its name from the Coun- 
tess of Crawford, by whom it was instituted.

The society consists partly of honorary and partly of general 
members, — the former paying a small sum yearly without any 
prospect of a return,— the latter so much per quarter, and receiv- 
ing a certain allowance weeklv in sickness or old ajre. One member 
yas on the funds betwixt fifteen and sixteen years, and received 
L. 120, Is. 6d. Had it not been for the charity of certain influential 
persons, it probably would have been long ere now extinct. There

is another Female Friendly Society in the town, of the manage- 
ment of which several respectable ladies take a charge, who endea- 
vour to render it as safe and useful as possible : it is conducted 
in a mode similar to the above. 

Charitable Bequests, — We have already said that Ayr abounds, 
above most other places, in posthumous benefactions to the poor, 
and this, the following list of charities of this description will am- 
ply testify. \st, The first in point of importance as well as extent 
we have noticed under another head, namely, the sum of fully 
L. 2000 bequeathed by Captain Smith, for the education of poor 
children, and which is appUed to the support of Smith's school. 
'■i.d. The late Mr Paterson of Ayr, who made a large fortune in 
the West Indies, left the sum of L. 500 to Glasgow Infirmary, 
and, m virtue of this bequest, conferred upon Ayr kirk-session the 
important privilege of having four patients belonging to the parish 
constantly on the listsof that useful establishment. 3c, A Mr Smith, 
alderman of Londonderry in 1692, bequeathed to the poor of the town 
of Ayr, his native place, L. 100, to be placed under the management 
of the magistrates and kirk-session, and this sum having been vested 
in land in the vicinity of the burgh, has come to be of great value in 
feus, and yields a revenue yearly of L. 55, which is divided about 
New- Year's day, apart from the poor's funds of the parish. 4:th, 
A Mr James Dick of this place, a few years ago, left L. 300, the 
interest of which to be distributed by the same managers, in a mode 
exactly similar to that of Alderman Smith's charity, and the two are 
generally divided simultaneously, bth, Sir Robert Blackwood, mer- 
chant in Edinburgh, but a native of Ayr, in the year 1711, -left 
the farm of Rodingrood, now called Sessionfield, consisting of up- 
wards of 100 acres, to the guardianship of the ministers and 
kirk-session of this parish, for behoof of the poor, and the annual 
rent to be distributed every year to poor householders, in' the same 
way as the two former bequests. Qth, In 1811, Lady John Camp- 
bell bequeathed, by will, the sum of L. 1200, the interest of which 
to be given to poor childless widows belonging to the parishes of 
Ayr and Monkton, under the charge of their respective sessions, 
and, by a subsequent deed, two-thirds of the proceeds are to be ap- 
portioned to Ayr. This bequest, does not come into operation till 
after the death of a lady who now enjoys it in liferent. 1th, The 
same is the case with respect to another bequest of L. 1000, made 
a few years ago, by Mrs Crawford of Ardmillan, in favour of re- 
duced females who had seen better days, and whose delicacy would

not permit them to let their wants be pubhcly known. The ma- 
gistrates and council are appointed joint trustees with the session, 
but the latter are to have the disbursement of it. Qth, In 1831, 
Captain Robert Tennant, a residenter in Ayr, left L. 300, un- 
der the guardianship of the ministers and session, the interest 
of which to be applied for behoof of the Poor's House. Qth, 
Miss Ballantine, of Castlehill, bequeathed, at her death, a short 
time ago, the sum of L. 1000, or the interest of such a sum as shall 
yield L. 5 a-year to ten poor females of the parish, appointing the 
magistrates, ministers, the Sheriff-substitute of the county, and the 
rector of the academy, to be the trustees and patrons. 10/t, and 
finally, John Fergusson, Esq. of Doonholm, already mentioned, not 
only bequeathed L. 1000 for the benefit of the ministers, and an- 
other for that of the teachers ; he also left L. 1000 for behoof of the 
poor of Ayr, the interest of which is paid yearly to the treasurer of 
the Poor's House. Besides the above, the interests of several smaller 
bequests of from L. 300 to L. 100 each, are at present held dur- 
ing life by poor female householders of the place, under the direc- 
torships generally, of the magistrates and ministers, each vacancy 
being filled up as it occurs by the death of the former holder. We 
may add to all this, that about 300 of the poor or upwards are sup- 
plied every winter with a cart of coals each, provided by a collec- 
tion at the two churches, the proceeds of which, by use and wont, 
and the steady benevolence of the community, may be counted on 
as regularly as those of any of the bequests above-mentioned. 
Further, the elder of every district of the town has a discretionary 
power to advance small sums of money, by orders on the treasurer, 
in cases of temporary exigency that may occur, such orders being 
submitted to the directors at each quarterly meeting, and these in 
the course of each year amount to betwixt L. 40 and L. .50, in ad- 
dition to the stated weekly aliment of the paupers. And over and 
above, the directors themselves, at their stated meetings, award 
small temporary grants, in the way of money, shoes, clothes, rent, 
&amp;c. to an amount, perhaps, nearly as large, to ward off craved addi- 
tions to ahment already fixed, or prevent applicants from being put 
for the first time upon the poor's roll. Now, when all the above state- 
ments are considered, and viewed in connexion with the annual pa- 
rochial provision for the poor by regular aliment, amounting to up- 
wards of L. 1000, it surely cannot fail to be admitted that charity 
is dispensed in Ayr with no niggardly hand.

Ayr GaoZ.— The prison was built at the same time with the 
county buildings already described ; and in its construction every 
attention has been paid to the security of the prisoners, while its 
situation is remarkably favourable to their health, as it stands on 
a large open space by the sea-beach. Within the last twelve- 
months, an entire change has been effected with respect to the 
treatment and discipline of the criminals confined. We may class 
them all under the designation of criminals, there being none at 
present confined for debt. The debtor's wing is now appropriated 
to female culprits. Formerly, the prisoners were allowed to spend 
the day together — the males in one common apartment or day- 
room, and the females in another, in total idleness ; wherein, by in- 
tercommunion of evil speech and depraved passions, they were ren- 
dered more wicked and profligate than ever, and incarceration made 
them worse, instead of reforming them. The younger culprits, too, 
were thus initiated into all the mystery and artifice of crime, by 
those who had been accustomed to follow it as a trade. Now, 
however, all this is happily at an end. Each prisoner is confined 
to a separate cell, and all are kept at hard labour for twelve or 
fourteen hours a day, without having any opportunity of seeing one 
another, even at their meals, which they receive alone at the pe- 
riods prescribed. The prison is visited by the keeper, and the 
prisoners are set to work at six o'clock in the morning ; and it is 
regularly shut at eight every night for rest, and against the admis- 
sion of visitors. The prisoners are compelled to wash once every 
day ; and their apartments are kept regularly clean and well-aired. 
Such of them as have not learned any trade are generally taught weav- 
ing, which they soon learn if young, and if old, they are employed 
in teasing old ship ropes into shreds, called oakum, which is used by 
ship-builders as wadding for closing the interstices of vessels. None 
are allowed to remain idle. A regular account is kept of their earn- 
ings, and the expense of their diet ; and on leaving gaol, if they 
have behaved well, the balance in their favor is given to them 
as a reward, but at the discretion of the prison committee, on the 
report of the keeper. A chaplain attends the male prisoners, in 
their separate cells, three times a-week, where he passes a portion 
of time in communicating religious instruction, and joining in a 
short prayer ; and each is furnished with a Bible. Such of them 
as cannot read, he puts in the way of learning to do so, and aids them 
in their attempts. In short, the whole system . is under most excel-

lent regulation, and we are enabled to say so confidently, and to give 
the above details from personal inspection. It is visited weekly by 
a small committee of the gaol directors, who undertake this duty in 
rotation, and generally record a written report ii\ a book kept for the 
purpose, as to the state in which matters are found The two impor- 
tant objects of incarceration seem to be fully accomplished in this 
gaol, namely, reformation and punishment combined. As the du- 
ties of the chaplain are most important, it would be desirable that 
he were made strictly responsible, not to the magistrates merely 
but to the county, and had a more liberal remuneration allowed. 
We have been the more minute in describing this amelioration 
in prison-discipline, as it is most important to the public, who, we 
believe, have been much indebted for the change to Mr Charles 
Fergusson, Younger of Kilkerran, and Mr Archibald Hamilton at 
Rozelle — gentlemen as eminent for their personal worth, as for 
their spirited exertions for the public good.

The average proportion of female to male prisoners is scarcely 
one-third. The prevailing crime of the former is theft, — that of 
the latter theft or assault. The number of cojumitments seems 
to be decreasing, and no capital convictions have taken place at 
our Circuit Courts for many years past. 

Fairs, Spirit-shops, Fuel. — There are four fairs held in Ayr 
in the course of the year, and two market-days weekly, viz. Tues- 
day and Friday. The number of licensed spirit-retailers is 106, 
or one to about every 70 or 80 of the population. Coal for fuel 
is to be got in abundance, of good quality, and at no great dis- 
tance, but it is rather high priced, costing from lis. to 14s. per ton, 
including carting. 

Concluding Rmarks. 
Ayr has undergone great and important ameliorations since the 
last Statistical Account was published, and if it go on improving in 
the same ratio for the next thirty years, it is impossible to estimate 
the degree of comparative importance to which it may arrive among 



AYR. S5 



the other provincial towns of Scotland. There are two material 
amendments which it obviously admits of and requires. We would 
recommend, /rsf, a rigid and uncompromising revision of the whole 
system of management of the poor. The amount of money an- 
nually expended for their support, besides being beyond all due 
bounds, as compared with other parishes, and entailing a heavy 
burden on the community, is tending every year to the increase of 
pauperism, and, what is worscj to injure materially the civil and 
moral condition of those who are verging on this state. We would 
suggest a scrupulous inquiry as to how far the numerous charities 
and mortifications with which the town abounds, might be made 
in some way available for the support of the poor, instead of being 
entirely supplementary, as at present, to their parochial aliment. 
Another beneficial change, that would add greatly to the prospe- 
rity of Ayr, is the introduction, to a greater extent, of manufactures 
and other public works. There is no want of capital, nor yet of 
enterprise, for this purpose, and only a few examples of successfial 
speculation in this way are all that is required to stimulate their 
practical application. The projected rail-road betwixt Ayr and 
Glasgow will doubtless give an impetus to trade and industrial 
enterprise every way, and effect improvements of every kind be- 
yond what it is possible at present to foresee or calculate.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JAMES STEVENSON, A. M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, boundaries, 8fc. — The name of this parish is evidently 
derived from its situation on the banks of the Ayr, and the town's 
being founded at a later period than the adjacent county town. 
In the charters granted to the burgh, it is called Nova villa super 
Air, and sometimes Nova villa de Air. The same name was given 
originally to the town of Ayr ; but when another town arose on the 
north side of the river, the name became appropriated to it, as be- 
ing the more modern. 

The parish is of very small extent : being only a mile and a 
half in length, and a mile in its greatest breadth. It is bounded 
on the north by the parish of Prestwick ; on the east by the pa- 
rishes of St Quivox and Wallacetown ; on the south by the river 
Ayr, separating it from the town and parish of Ayr ; and on the 
west by the Frith of Clyde. The figure of the parish is oblong ; 
being broadest about the middle, and narrowing at the northern 
and southern extremities. It is level throughout its whole extent, 
without any eminence to diversify the landscape. The whole 
length of the parish is washed by the Frith of Clyde. The coast 
is flat and sandy, terminating, however, at the north-west corner 
of the parish in an inconsiderable rocky point, which projects a 
little way into the sea. 

Meteorology.— K daily register of the winds having been kept 
for a long period at Cowan and Sloan's Office, agent for Lloyd's, 
we are enabled to present the following table of them for the years 
1820, 18-25, 1830, 1835, and 1836. Ve content ourselves with 
giving the annual results for the four former years ; but subjoin 
the prevailing winds for each month of 1836 : —

It will be seen from the above tables, that the prevailing winds 
are the west and south-west ; and it may be remarked in general, 
that the westerly winds are warm and moist, and the easterly dry 
and cold. The heaviest gales are from the south-west, west, and 
north-west. The climate is mild when compared with that of the 
east coast ; and, as might be inferred from the situation of the pa- 
rish, the temperature is more equal throughout the year than that 
of the inland districts, — the sea-breeze moderating the heat of 
summer and the cold of winter. On this account it forms a desi- 
rable residence for the invalid, who may suifer from either extreme.

AYRSHIRE. 



The air is pure and bracing ; and there are few places where the 
blessing of health is enjoyed in a greater degree. No disease can 
be said more particularly to prevail, and many of the inhabitants 
attain to a good old age. 

Geology and Mineraloff7/.~The whole parish is covered, imme- 
diately below the soil, with beds of sand and gravel ; and beneath 
these, is a bed of clay, interspersed with numerous water-worn 
stones, chiefly of augite-greenstono. On the surface of the 
clay, there are numerous boulder-stones of considerable size, 
which are also for the most part of the same rock. Be- 
low these beds of sand, gravel, and clay, are found those stra- 
tified rocks, known by the name of coal measures. The direction 
of the dip is to the north, and of course the rise is to the south. 
With these coal measures there is associated, at the southern 
boundary of the parish, a bed of trap-rock, more than twenty feet 
in thickness; and about 1000 yards north from the river, there 
is found, immediately subjacent to it, a thin bed of coal, which it 
has entirely reduced to a very hard cinder. But between this 
point and the river, the trap suddenly changes its position, and is 
found on the top of a second bed of coal ten fathoms lower than 
the other, which has, in consequence, also been destroyed. This 
second coal is the uppermost of the two workable seams of coal 
known in this neighbourhood : and it is only in the situation now 
mentioned, that it has been found destroyed by the trap. It 
should also be noticed, that betwixt the northern and southern 
parts of the parish, there is a separation of the minerals by a slip 
or shift of the strata, which casts them up about sixty fathoms in 
the northern or dip direction. 

Each of the two workable beds of coal contained in the mineral 
field is nearly four feet in thickness. . The upper is a soft coal : 
the second is very hard, and of the description called splint coal. 
The distance between the two beds is about twenty six fathoms, and 
the intervening strata are alternations of bituminous or aluminous 
shale and sandstone. But the uppermost of the two beds of coal 
is not found in the northern part of the parish, having been thrown 
out by the great shift of the strata already mentioned. 

The working of coal was formerly carried on to a great extent 
in this parish, and during a period of sixty years. At one time 
the profits of the freemen of the burgh from this source amounted 
to more than L. 300 per annum. But in 1632, the pits were 
closed : both seams of coal being then exhausted. Trials have 
been made at different times to discover, by boring, other beds of 



NEWTON-UPON-AYB. §9 



coal below these seams; but although the boring was carried 
down in one instance to the depth of fifty fathoms beyond the low- 
est of the wrought seams, no bed of coal of sufficient thickness to 
admit of its being worked could be found : and the bore terminated 
in alternate layers of greenstone and redstone. 

There are at present no workings of minerals in the parish, with 
the exception of a sandstone or freestone quarry at its northern ex- 
tremity, which, although not long opened, is believed to contain a 
freestone bed of great thickness, and promises to afford a large sup- 
ply of building materials. On removing the sand and gravel from the 
surface of the rock, with which it is covered to the depth of fifteen 
feet, there were found numerous bones of animals and decayed 
pieces of wood; and in one spot, close upon the freestone, a copper 
coin of the reign of Charles the Second, which, as the quarry is 
about 200 yards from high-water mark, seems to prove that there 
has been a progressive advancement of the coast upon the sea. 
There is one exception, however, to this remark, as applied to this 
parish, which must not be left unnoticed. While the land towards 
the north appears to be gaining on the sea, the sea, on the other 
hand, has of late years been rapidly encroaching on the coast at 
the other end of the parish, immediately behind the harbour. 
This has been ascribed to the pier's being carried farther out on 
the other side of the river than it has yet been on this side ; a 
supposition which is rendered the more probable by the circum- 
stance, that, while the sea is making encroachments on the north 
side of the river, it is proportionably receding on the south side. 
But whatever be the cause, several acres of land behind the pier 
in this parish, on which a row of houses stood within the last ten 
or twelve years, have been overflowed by the sea, and are now 
within high-water mark : so that it has even been in contempla- 
tion to raise a mound along the shore to prevent the sea from 
further gaining on the town. 

As the surface of the greater part of the parish was originally 
a bed of barren sand, the soil naturally partakes of that character. 
It is now, however, in a rapid course of improvement ; and it has 
been improved, in many cases, by the admixture of a blue shale or 
till, of which great quantities were thrown out during the working 
of the coal-mines. 

Zoology — Fishes. — Of these, great numbers are caught by the 
fishermen of this parish, and not lessthan thirty different species 
have been reckoned up, which are commonly or occasionally sold 
and used for food. The most valuable of these arc the turbot, 



90 



AYRSHIRE. 



the sole, the hahbut, and the shrimp. The most abundant are 
the whiting, haddock, cod-fish, ling, flounder, salmon, mackerel, 
skate, and herring. And those less frequently found are the 
mullet f Mu/il cephalus J ; horse-mackerel Scombei- trachurus  ; 
sun-fish, which is very rare and little valued; pilchard  Clu- 
pea jnlchardusj ; lythe  Gadus pollachius , caught at the end 
of harvest by nets, and also by the fly ; and saith or cole-fish 
 Gadus carbonarius,  which is caught by lines as well as in 
nets. 

Besides these, the conger-eel, called by the fishermen have-eel 
Murcpna conger is found in great abundance, but it is only of 
late years that it has been sold for food. The silver sole Pleu- 
ronectes Margaretta is got in deep water, but it is now in small 
request. Trout are also occasionally taken; and lobsters and 
crabs are caught, the former in great numbers. 

Of fishes which are not sold, the Portugal shark or sheer dog 
Squalus cornubicus is met with, particularly when fishes are 
abundant. The porpoise or pelliak  Delphinus phoccena  fol- 
lows the herrings, and is sometimes caught in the turbot nets : 
as does likewise the spout-whale or herring-hoy  BalcBnaphysaltis 
which is supposed to live on the spawn or fry of the herring. 
Corse-foot or five fingered star-fish  Asterea rubens  are found in 
great abundance, sometimes on almost every hook of the fisher- 
men's lines.' The kethick or ,ei-dievi\  Lophius piscatorius is 
sometimes found of the weight of three or four stones. It is armed 
with sharp teeth, has a head disproportionately large, and is a 
most hideous-looking fish. The ink- fish f »Se/m loUgo is plen- 
tiful, and employed as bait for skate-fish. It is well known to 
derive its name from the dark inky kind of liquor which it dis- 
charges from its mouth, so as completely to blacken the water all 
around it. ' 

Botany. — In a parish of such limited extent, and with so little 
variety of soil, few rare plants can be expected to occur. It may, 
however, be mentioned, that the Teesdalia nudicaidis, Senebiera co- 
ronopus, Arabis verna, and Arabis thaliana — all nearly allied to 
each other, both according to the natural and artificial classifica- 
tion, are here to be met with. The Sedum villosum, the Brassica 
monensis, the Ei'yngium maritimum, or sea holly, which is scarcely 
to be found except on the western coast ; and the Ceutimcidus 
minimus a very rare plant are also found — the last mentioned 
on the northern confines of the parish. The Convolvulus Solda- 



NEWTON-UPON-AYR. 



91 



nella, which is scarcely to be met with in another parish in the 
county, is here found growing in a small patch of ground among 
pure sand, within a little distance of the shore. 

II, — Civil History. 
Consiitution of the Burgh.— The constitution of this burgh, 
particularly with regard to the property belonging to it, is very 
singular, and can only be paralleled by that of the neighbouring 
bugh of Prestwick. The date of its erection cannot be ascer- 
tained, as the original charter of its creation has been lost. But 
it is traditionally ascribed to a grant by Robert the Bruce, in fa- 
vour of forty-eight of the inhabitants who had distinguished them- 
selves at the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. It is matter of his- 
tory that Robert was present at the Parliament held at Ayr on 
the 26th April 1315, when the crown was settled on him and his 
descendants ; and it is certain, from documentary evidence, that 
the erection of the burgh and the territorial grant to the freemen, 
must have occurred between 1208-14, and 1446. All its previ- 
ously-existing privileges were, however, renewed and confirmed by 
a charter granted by James VI. dated in 1595; and by a second 
charter, granted by him in 1600 ; which proceed on the narrative 
of certain ancient writings and title-deeds having been exhibited 
to his Majesty respecting the original erection of the burgh, and 
of its former charters having been lost by reason of the wars and 
dissensions of the times. 

In these charters the lands of the parish, with the whole privi- 
leges thereto attached, as the same had been enjoyed by their 
ancestors, are granted anew to the burgesses; with power to grant 
feus, and divide among themselves the territorial possessions thus 
conveyed to them. They are also empowered to elect bailies, a 
treasurer, councillors, and other officers necessary for the govern- 
ment of the burgh. 

The number of freemen among whom the partition of the com- 
inon property could be made, was, from the earliest times, hmited 
to forty-eight, who were regarded as exclusively composing the 
community/. Sons of burgesses, and failing sons, their sons-in-law, 
succeeded to the burgess-ship of their father, and to his portion of 
the lands, and other possessions of the burgh. But latterly, 
daughters have been admitted as well as sons, and other relations 
besides direct descendants, to inherit the rights of freedom ; and 
in certain cases the widows of freemen have been admitted to en- 
joy the life-rent of the lot or portion of lands, which belonged to 



92 



AYRSHIRE. 



their husbands. It would appear that the common property has 
been divided among the forty-eight freemen, from time to time, 
from the first erection of the burgh. But the first " daill" or di- 
vision of which there is any record, took place in 1604, and was 
to subsist till 1615. Owing, however, to the want of entries in 
the community-book for a considerable period after this last date, 
, we have no account of another " daill" till 1655, which was also 
to subsist for eleven years. But from 1666 till 1771, a new par- 
tition was made every seven years, and the allotments made are 
regularly recorded. In this last mentioned year, in order to put 
an end to the evils which had been experienced from the short 
period of possession which they had heretofore enjoyed — the free- 
men resolved that the division which then fell to be rnade should 
continue for fifty-seven years. And, when this period expired in 
1828, it was determined that the continuance of the lots which 
were then ballotted for should be for 999 years. In 1833, it 
was farther agreed, that feu-rights of their lots should be granted 
to such of the freemen as might wish to hold their lands in that 
manner. 

The extent of the lots possessed by the freemen vary from six 
to ten acres, according to the quality of the land. Their value 
was formerly small. But since coal was discovered in the lands, 
and more particularly since their respective possessions were ren- 
dered more permanent, their value has greatly increased : and of 
thirty freedoms which have been sold within the last forty years, 
the prices have varied from L. 70 to L. 500. 

Newton is included within the parliamentary boundaries of the 
burgh of Ayr by the Reform Act, so as to form one constituen- 
cy with it in returning a Member to the House of Commons. No 
actual list of the L. 10 proprietors or occupiers has been taken, 
but there are 218 occupants of L. 5 yearly and upwards, and it is 
computed that about 100 of these have tenements at or above L. 10 
yearly. 

The council of the burgh consists of two bailies, one treasurer, 
and six councillors, who are annually elected by the freemen from 
among their own number. Although their powers are extensive, 
they have of late years only exercised jurisdiction in processes of 
sequestration for rent, and petty breaches of the peace ; and even 
this limited jurisdiction is now seldom exercised. The constitu- 
tion of the burgh in this respect will be altered, and possibly may 



NEWTON-UPON-AYR. 93 

be extinguished, if the Municipal Corporations' Bill now depenoing 
before Parliament, pass into a law. , i, i j • 

Land-Owners.— T\xe freemen are proprietors of all the land m 
the parish, with the exception of ten acres. The greater part ot 
the crround occupied by the town is also held in feu from them. 
Wiufam Forbes, Esq. of Callendar, has the right of superiority 
over the main street : but the jurisdiction of the magistrates ex- 
tends to it, as well as to the other parts of the town. 

Surveijs of the Parish.— 'P]ans of the grounds belonging to the 
freemen have been repeatedly made. The latest was drawn up m 
1829, by Mr James Milliken of Ayr. 

Parochial Registers.— These have been regularly kept since the 
erection of Newton into a separate parish, which took place in 
1779. 

Antiquities.— Under this head mention may be made of a large 
building called Newton Castle, which formerly stood in Garden 
Street, and was for a long period the seat of the Wallaces of Crai- 
gie. They removed to it from the Castle of Craigie whose state- 
ly ruins may still be seen in the parish of that name in the be- 
ginning of the sixteenth century, and continued to reside in this 
parish till Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie, the fifth baronet, built 
Craigie House, which stands on the north bank of the Ayr, a short 
way from the town. The writer has seen a view of Ayr, taken about 
130 years ago, in which Newton House appears very prominent- 
ly— a castellated building of moderate height, surrounded by gar- 
dens and numerous trees. Beyond it, the houses of Newton are 
seen; apparently very humble dwellings, all thatched, and none 
of them exceeding the height of one storey. This old castle was 
taken -down sixty or seventy years ago, and now there only remains 
part of the wall which enclosed the garden. Among its ruins, there 
was found an antique mathematical quadrant, and the barrel of an 
old gun, or rather wall-piece, seven feet long, and very heavy : 
both of which are preserved in the library belonging to the Ayr 
Mechanics' Institution.  

Modern Buildings. — The only public buildings in the town are 
the parish church, a plain edifice, standing near to the site of 
Newton Castle, and behind the Council-house. The latter, which 
is an equally plain building, was erected forty years ago, and is sur- 
mounted by a steeple of no great height. The principal street in 

 Garden Street, in which Newton House stood, was, a few years ago, transferred 
to St Quivox, and is now ineluded in the newly constituted parish of Wallacetown. 



94 



AYRSHIRE. 



the town is of considerable length, and about eighty feet in breadth ; 
but few of the houses in it can be said to be elegant. Between it 
and the sea, a new town has arisen within the last thirty years, con- 
sisting of three or four streets, which are regularly laid out, but are 
as yet only partially built. The town, after being stationary for a 
time in consequence of the ceasing of the coal-works, is now extend - 
ing. Two handsome villas have been recently built by freemen 
on their lands, and there is every reason to anticipate that their 
number will soon be greatly increased. 

III. — Population. 
At the Union, the population of the parish is supposed to have 
been under 400. In 1755, it is inferred from Dr Webster's re- 
port to have amounted to 581. In 1778, it had risen to 1600. In 
1791, it was ascertained by an accurate survey, to amount to 1689, 
of which number there were 836 males, and 853 females. 

In 1801, the population was 1724 
181 1, - 2809 

1821, - 4027 

1831, 4020 

In 1831, there were 1927 males, and 2093 females. 

The increase in the population between 1755 and 1778 was 
chiefly owing to an extensive herring-fishery, then carried on along 
this coast, particularly near the mouth of the Ayr. For some years 
after 1778, the number rather decreased, in consequence of the 
suspension of the coal- works. But on their being resumed in 1786, 
the population steadily increased, and between 1801 and 1821 
was more than doubled. After this last mentioned date, from the 
ceasing of the coal-works, and the removal of those employed in 
them to the neighbouring parishes, the number of inhabitants re- 
mained for a considerable time nearly stationary, and it is only 
very recently they have again begun to increase. 

The number of the population residing in the town is, - 3768 

in the countrj', - 252 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years, - 104 

marriages, - - - 42 

burials within the parish, - - 69 . 

But a considerable proportion of those who die in the parish are 
interred in the grave-yards in Ayr and Wallacetown. 



The number of persons as ascertained by a late survey, 

under 15 years of age is, - 1594 

betvvixt 15 and 30 - 1128 

betwixt 30 and 50, - - 692 

betwixt 50 and 70, - - 446 

upwards of 70, - - 100 

Number of unmarried men upwards of 50, - 21 

unmarried women upwards of 45, - 106 
families according to census of 1831, - 871

Number of inhabited houses, - - ''• 

houses uninhabited or building, - 5 
families chiefly employed in agriculture, - - 4 

trade, manufactures, &amp;c. 448 

The number of insane and fatuous persons is 3, of blind 3, and 
of deaf and dumb 2. 

The number of illegitimate births during the last three years is, 
as nearly as can be ascertained, 36, being on an average 12 yearly. 

There are no proprietors of land in the parish of the value of 
L. 50 yearly. The average annual rent of the portion of land be- 
longing to a freeman will not exceed L. 12 or L. 13; and in only 
one or two instances are two such portions held by one individual; 
when the right of one freedom nominally belongs to a son or other 
relation. 

Character and Habits of the People. — There is not much that is 
distinctive in the character or manners of the inhabitants. The 
freemen were at one period somewhat rude and unpolished, and by 
•no means noted for the decorum observed by them at their public 
convivial entertainments. They have even been accused of being 
" below mediocrity in wealth, industry, intelligence, education, 
and respectability," — a charge for which, at the time when it was 
made, its author was certainly much more indebted to fancy than 
to fact. But, whatever may have been the case in former days, 
the freemen as a body are now highly respectable ; almost all of 
them are in comfortable circumstances ; and a considerable pro- 
portion of their number much above mediocrity in wealth, educa- 
tion and intelligence. 

The fishermen are the most peculiar class of the inhabitants. 
Several of them are the descendants of a colony from Pitsligo and 
some places adjacent, which settled in this place sixty years ago. 
They were induced to do so from some of their number, who had 
been impressed on board a man-of-war, which was for a considera- 
ble time stationed in the Frith of Clyde, having observed that 
fishes were to be found on this coast in great abundance. The 
form of the fishermen's coats is a little singular : and until lately, 
their Sunday's dress consisted of home-made blue-cloth. . They 
live, as might be supposed, to a considerable extent on fish ; and it 
is alleged are not so attentive as could be wished to cleanliness in 
their habits. But to this remark there are not a few honourable 
exceptions. Fish are here obtained so cheap, and excellent in 
quality, that they are a very common article of food. Beer was 
formerly a favourite beverage, and was taken by the fishermen in 



9i 



AYRSHIRE. 



their boats in preference to whisky. But the number of brewers 
has of late years declined ; and it is to be feared that, with the di- 
minished consumption of beer, ardent spirits are proportionably in 
greater request. 

It is pleasing to have to state, that poaching'is almost unknown. 
The same may be said of smuggling — and there is not a pawn- 
broking establishment in the town. 

On the whole, it may be said, that, although few of the inhabi- 
tants are wealthy, the number of persons in extreme poverty is less 
than is commonly to be found in other communities of similar ex- 
tent. An unusual proportion of famiUes live in houses built by 
themselves ; and though the circumstances of many of them be 
humble, they are contented, and, comparatively speaking, comforta- 
ble. Instances of gross immorality are unfrequent. And while it 
must be acknowledged that here, as in other parishes where the 
population has outgrown the means of church accommodation, not 
a few habitually absent themselves from public ordinances; the ge- 
neral character of even these is superior to what we might have 
been led to anticipate. No doubt much of this is owing to the 
example of their church-going neighbours, who elevate that con- 
ventional standard of morality, below which it is reckoned disgrace- 
ful to fall. And, respecting the latter, it is proper to mention, that 
they have long been distinguished for a more than ordinary respect 
for religion and its ordinances ; and there is reason to believe, that 
there is not a small number among them who are imbued with 
the spirit of genuine piety, and live under the influence of divine 
truth.

All the land belonging to the freemen is now divided, with the 
exception of eight acres reserved for a quarry. There are almost 
no trees in the parish ; nor is it easy to rear them, from want of 
sufficient shelter. And- so long as the lands were common proper- 
ty, there was little inducement to any individual to expend money 
in plantations, which would soon fall to be possessed by another. 
This was, indeed, an insuperable obstacle to all kinds of improve- 



NEWTON-UPON'AYR. 



97 



nient. Nor is it matter of wonder that, while the land chang- 
ed possessors every seven years, little should have been done in in- 
closing fields, or meliorating the soil. But after the experience of 
centuries had at length convinced the freemen of the necessity of 
a change in this respect, and their tenures were first greatly extend- 
ed, and latterly rendered permanent, there was a complete revolu- 
tion in the rural economy of the parish. Land which had previ- 
ously been allowed to lie waste was brought under cultivation — 
rude turf-mounds gave place to thorn-hedges or substantial stone- 
walls, with which most of the fields are now enclosed — and so great- 
ly has the soil been improved, that from these and other causes, 
freedoms are more than ten times their value about forty years 
ago. Such has been the favourable result of a partial abandon- 
ment of the " principles of equality and independence," of which, 
as is remarked in the appendix to the last Statistical Account, the 
constitution of this burgh affords one of the best exemplifications. 

Rent of Land. — The highest rent given for arable land is L. 5, 
per acre, but some of it will not yield more than 10s. The average 
rent may be stated at L. 1, los. The rent of grazing a cow is 
from L. 4 to L. 5. The greater part of the land is cultivated by 
the freemen themselves ; and it is somewhat singular that, in a pa- 
rish where so many are more or less employed in agriculture, only 
one family is exclusively supported by farming. 

Fisheries. — With the exception of those employed in the salmon- 
fishery, who remain here for only a part of the year, all the fisher- 
men in the district reside in this parish. They are chiefly engag- 
ed in white-fishing. Seven boats are employed in it, and there 
are four men required for each boat. About twenty years ago, 
their wages were 3s. 6d. a day : now they have fallen to 2s. In- 
stead of fishing as they formerly did. through the whole extent of 
the Frith, and even up LocK-Fyne, numbers of the Newton fisher- 
men have settled permanently at the various stations which they 
were wont only occasionally to visit. And those who remain have 
not merely their range of fishing circumscribed, but, being exclud- 
ed from the Glasgow market by the successful rivalry of their 
brethren on the Highland coasts, who have the advantage of more 
frequent and convenient communication by steam-boats with the 
western metropolis, they are now limited to the supplying of Ayr, 
and the neighbouring villages. The consequence is, that the fisher- 
men are generally poor, and are no longer the respectable class of 
men which they were in more prosperous days.

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce yearly 
raised in the parish is as follows: 

Produce of grain of all kinds, cultivated for the food of man or the domestic 

animals, . . . . _ l_ gg 

Of potatoes and turnips, . . , ' 202

Of fisheries, estimated at . . .  ' 1050 

Freestone quarry, ... . 400 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, . L. 2666 

Manufactures. — The most important of these are ship-building, 
rope and sail-making, iron and brass-founding, and smith-work. 

Ship-building has for a long period been carried on at this har- 
bour. About thirty years ago, there were not less than 200 men 
employed ; but it afterwards gradually declined till within the last 
ten years. It has of late been carried on to a considerable extent 
in the wood-yard of Messrs Cowan and Sloan. In 1831, a pa- 
tent slip was erected by Mr Morton, the patentee : and since that 
time 111 vessels have been taken on and repaired, and nine new 
ones have been built, registering from 47 to 43.3 tons each. Some 
of these have been constructed by orders from shipowners in 
Greenock, and one for the East India trade. Betwixt 40 and 
50 hands are constantly employed, who work eight hours in winter 
and ten in summer, and earn from 18s. to L. 1, per week. In the 
rope and sail- work, 10 hands are at present employed, whose 
weekly wages are from 12s. to 15s. It is worthy of remark, that 
after great fluctuations of prosperity and depression in the interval, 
both of these branches of trade are, as nearly as may be, in the 
same state in which they were at the date of the last Statistical 
Account 1791 — there being then 50 men employed in shipbuild- 
ing, and 10 in manufacturing ropes. 

There are four foundries in which machinery of all kinds is ma- 
nufactured, and smith-work executed : but none of them are on 
an extensive scale. The working hours are ten per day; 34 
men and 14 boys are at present employed ; and the average 
weekly wages are, for men, 16s. and for boys 5s. There is also a 
salt-work, containing two pans, in which salt is made chiefly from 
the rock imported from Liverpool. Five men are employed in 
it, whose wages are 10s. 6d. a-week. 

An interesting enumeration was given in the last Statistical Ac- 
count of Newton, of all the occupations of the inhabitants, and 
the number employed in each. Nothing so minute can now be 
attempted. But it may be mentioned, as the result of a carefid 



NEWTON-UPON-AYR. 



99 



survey, that, in addition to fishermen, carpenters, and smiths, whose 
numbers have been already stated, there are in the parish 400 
weavers employed by agents for Glasgow houses, 27 colliers, 
34 masons, 20 sawyers, and including 12 shipmasters about 
100 seamen. It may not be unimportant to add, that, as nearly 
as can be estimated, there are 600 or 700 women, principally 
girls and unmarried women, employed in hand-sewing for ware- 
houses in Glasgow. 

The Ayrshire needle-work, so extensively known and justly ce- 
lebrated, was executed in this parish forty years ago : and it has 
been gradually improving until the present day. It consists of 
various patterns sewed on muslin and cambric for ladies' dresses, 
babies' robes, caps, kc. From the year 1815, when point was in- 
troduced into the work, the demand for it in London and other 
parts of England, as well as in Dublin and Edinburgh, has in- 
creased to a considerable extent. It is also sent to France, Rus- 
sia, and Germany, and is exposed to sale in the shops of Paris. 
This valuable means of employment affords a fair profit to the 
manufacturer, and gives support to many respectable females, who 
by dint of industry, can earn from Is. to Is. 6d. and, in some cases, 
2s. per day. In this work, which is confined to Ayr and its neigh- 
bourhood, several hundreds are engaged : and it is calculated that 
at least from 50 to 60 of them, who are chiefly young women, re- 
side in the parish of Newton. 

Navigation. — That we may not interfere with the account of 
the neighbouring parish of Ayr, we shall enter into no details un- 
der this head. It is proper, however, to state, that Newton has a 
joint interest in the harbour with the adjacent county town, and 
it would appear that this burgh formerly laid claim to anchorage- 
dues. Nearly all the coal exported from the harbour, which con- 
stitutes a chief part of its trade, is received on this side of the river. 
One hundred waggon-loads are daily conveyed to the port along a 
railway, from the coal-mines in the parish of St Quivox. About 
300 vessels of all sizes are annually loaded with coal, chiefly for 
Ireland and the West Highlands. The yearly exportation amounts 
to 40,000 tons, which, at the present price of 13s. per ton of 28 
cwt., makes the value of this trade L. 26,000 per annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Markets, 4".— Newton has a market-day, but it is merely no- 
minal — all important business being transacted in Ayn The po- 
pulation residing in the town is 3768. The town is situated in the 



100 



AYRSHIRE. 



south end of the parish, on the north bank of the river Ayr, and 
has scarcely any visible line of demarcation from Wallacetown. 
As respects the means of communication, it has all the advantages 
enjoyed by the county town, of which it may be regarded as a 
suburb. The mail and other coaches to Glasgow pass and repass 
daily. There is also a coach for Edinburgh, which passes daily 
through the parish ; besides which there are regular conveyances 
to Kilmarnock, Troon, and Irvine. There is only one turnpike 
road in the parish, which is a mile and a-half in length. There 
is also a rail-road, made about twenty years ago, along which, coals 
are conveyed from the mines to the harbour. 

The harbour has lately been much improved; but, from a defi- 
ciency of funds, the improvements begun on the north side of the 
river have not yet been completed. A light-house was first erect- 
ed in 1790, by the company who rented the coal belonging to the 
community of Newton, on the north-east side of the harbour. But, 
as it was swept away by the encroachments of the sea, a wooden 
structure was erected in its place in 1827, which, though wanting 
in the recommendation of elegance, unquestionably possesses that 
of utility. ' 

Ecclesiastical State. — Newton was originally part of the united 
parishes of Monkton and Prestwick ; but the inhabitants being 
four miles distant from the parish church, where they had only ac- 
commodation for twelve or fourteen out of a population of between 
700 and 800 examinable persons, a large amount of the common 
fund which fell to be divided among the freemen, was, in 1776, ge- 
nerously set apart by them for building a place of worship within 
the burgh. It was at first established in 1778, on the footing of 
a chapel of ease; but, in 1779, a decreet of disjunction and erection 
was obtained from the Court of Teinds, by which the burgh with 
its territory was constituted a separate parish. By that decreet, 
the whole teinds of the lands belonging to the , freemen were re- 
served to the minister of the original parish ; and an obligation 
was laid on them and their successors to uphold and repair the 
church of Newton, and provide a suitable stipend for the minister, 
besides a manse and glebe. It does honour to the liberality of 
the freemen — who are the only heritors in the parish — that, at a 
time when their own resources were but small, they voluntarily 
came under these obligations, — expending in the erection of the 
church and manse about L. 2000. And although the burgh was 
thereby brought to the brink of bankruptcy, they were ultimately 



NEVVTON-UFON-AYR. 



101 



enabled, by means of the revenue derived from their coal-works, 
to free themselves from their difficulties. It should also be men- 
tioned, that in 1778, they purchased the right of patronage to their 
church from the patroness of Monkton and Prestwick. This is 
still held by them, and exercised in a peculiar manner. They 
are obliged to elect annually thirteen of their number, who are 
called delegates. Upon these delegates devolves the management 
of the secular affairs of the church ; and in the case of a Vacancy 
they have the sole power of electing a minister, and granting a pre- 
sentation — but nine out of the thirteen must concur in the choice. 

The church, which was built in 1778, was lately enlarged, and 
now affords accommodation for 1032 persons. There are no free 
sittings. The manse was built in 1787, and repaired in 1827. 
The glebe contains 6 acres, including the ground occupied by 
the garden, manse, and offices, and may be valued at L. 15 a year. 
The stipend amounts only to L. 60, with L. 5, for a cow's grass. 
But L. 90 is allowed by Government ; and a gratuity, besides, is 
given by the freemen out of the proceeds of the seat-rents, which 
is at present L. 95 ; so that the amount annually received by the 
incumbent is L. 250. There is also an allowance of L. 8 for sa- 
cramental expenses. The glebe was inclosed two years ago with a 
wall at a considerable expense ; and a garden wall is at present 
building. 

There is no other church, nor any dissenting chapel in the pa- 
rish. Three-fourths of the population belong to the Established 
Church ; so that the accommodation provided for them is very in- 
adequate, especially when it is taken into account that a conside- 
rable proportion of the congregation is extra-parochial. The fol- 
lowing table, with which the writer has been favoured by his pre- 
decessor, exhibits the classification of the inhabitants of the pa- 
rish according to their religious profession, with the number of 
sittings possessed by them respectively in their places of worship. 
It is the result of a survey made in December 1835, and January 
1836.

The result is, that 2960 persons, professing to belong to the 
Established Church, hold 708 sittings, and of that number 801 are 
communicants : 990 Dissenters of all denominations hold 355 
sittings : and among them there are 350 communicants. 

Divine service at the Established Church is always well attend- 
ed. Scarcely a sitting is unlet. The Lord's supper is dispen- 
sed twice a year, and the number who communicate each time is 
betwixt 700 and 800. The amount of extraordinary collections 
for religious and charitable objects is small ; but the ordinary col- 
lections for the support of the poor are, comparatively speaking, 
liberal. There are three religious societies connected with the 
parish, but none of them exclusively so, viz. the Ayr, Newton, and 
Wallacetown Female Bible Society; the Ayr Sabbath School 
Union Society, which has three schools in this parish, attended by 
about 200 children; and the Newton, Wallacetown, and St -Quivox 
Society, for the monthly distribution of Tracts. 

Education. — There are in all five schools in the parish, but 
two of them are of a very imperfect description ; being taught by 
elderly women in the humbler walks of life, and intended solely for 
beginners. Wages are from 2d. to 3d. per week. Of the remain- 
ing three, one is for the education of young ladies — and in it En- 
glish, writing, music, drawing, and fancy-work are taught on mo- 
derate terms; another, in which all the ordinary branches are 
taught, is unendowed. Besides these, there is the parochial school, 
which is at present attended by 91 scholars. In addition to the ele- 
mentary branches, instruction is given in mathematics, Latin and 
French. The schoolmaster has the minimum salary. He has no 
house or garden, but an allowance in lieu of them. The average 
amount of school-fees received does not exceed L. 50 a-year. There 
is a small fund of L. 98, the interest of which is appropriated to the 
education of children of the poor, provided their parents have been 
born in the parish. The general expense of education may be stat- 
ed at 3s. 6d. per quarter. The whole number of children attending 
schools within the parish is only 250, which is not more than a six- 
teenth of the population. Many, however, attend the Ayr Academy, 
and other schools which are in the immediate vicinity ; so that \i is 
believed the number who cannot read or write is but small. Still 

4 



NEWTON-UPON-AYR. 

there is a lack of the means of education ; and one or two additional 
endoioed schools are much required. 

Library— k parochial Ubrary was institutedin 1829, and contams 
about 500 volumes. The annual subscription is 2s., and the num- 
ber of readers varies from 60 to 100. 

Friendly Societies.— Oi these there are only two, which can be 
considered as belonging to this parish, and they are not m a.pros- 
perous state. But there are 10 or 12 societies whose members 
are scattered through Ayr, Newton, and Wallacetown ; and smce 
1790, they have distributed among their sick and infirmembers 
L. 13,643. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank was instituted in 1815 jor..the 
parishes of Ayr, Newton, and St Quivox. The sums invested 
yearly have since its commencement gradually increased. Last 
year they amounted to L. 2715— the sums withdrawn to L. 2375. 
In the course of the last two years 503 accomits have been opened 
for new depositors, about one-fourth of whom reside in this parish. 
The depositors in general belong to the various classes of mecha- 
nics,— weavers, masons, shoemakers, carpenters, &amp;c.— and a very 
considerable proportion are females, employed at needle-work, or 

as domestic servants. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The following table shows the ave- 
rage number of persons who have received parochial aid for the 
~ last seven years, the annual amount of contributions for their re- 
lief, and the corresponding outlay :

Besides the monthly pensioners, whose allowance \'aries from 
Is. 6d. to 8s. per month, and may be averaged at 4s. 6d., there are 
many who receive occasional aid. The funds for the support of 
the poor are raised by church collections, amounting to about 
L. 100 yearly, and by an assessment, which varies from L. 45 to 
L. 50. A little additional assistance is obtained from occasional 
donations, penalties, and other miscellaneous sources of income. 
It will be observed that, for some years past, the income has been 
exceeded by the expenditure. To remove the debt, which is thus 
accumulating, it is proposed to increase the assessment ; but it is 



104 



AYRSHIllR, 



to be feared that the effect of doing so would be to diminish pro- 
portionably the church collections. The assessment is not pro- 
ductive, nor is it very vk'illingly paid. It would be extremely de- 
sirable if it were possible to dispense with it altogether. But to 
this it is objected, that Dissenters, who do nothing voluntarily for 
the support of the poor, would then be entirely relieved. Even 
this grievance, however, might be submitted to, if the amount 
raised by voluntary contributions were adequate to meet the ne- 
cessary expenditure. It is to be regretted, that there seems to be 
little indisposition among the poor to seek parochial relief. Some 
there are, indeed, who wilhngly submit to privations rather than ap- 
ply for it ; but much greater is the number of those who feel no 
reluctance in making such applications. 

Inns, Alehouses, 8fc. — There are 30 public-houses or places 
where spirituous liquors are sold, which is in the proportion of one 
to every twenty-nine families — a number unnecessarily large. 

Fuel. — Almost the only fuel made use of is coal, which is pro- 
cured in abundance from the mines in the parish of St Quivox, 
which are little more than a mile distant from the town. A cart- 
load of 14 cwt. costs 6s. 9d. But many prefer the coal brought 
from pits at several miles distance, which is higher in price but su- 
perior in quality. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Some of the variations betwixt the present state of the parish 
and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical Account 
have been referred to under former heads. The population has 
in the interval increased from 1689 to upwards of 4000. The 
style of building is much superior, and a new and excellent road 
has been opened, aff'ording a fine approach to the town. Still 
more marked have been the improvements in the rural economy of 
the parish. Formerly a considerable tract of ground belonging to 
the freemen remained in common ; their fields were generally open, 
and were kept constantly in tillage. Now the system of rotation 
of crops is duly attended to ; the cultivated fields are well enclos- 
ed ; the soil has been improved in a high degree ; and no land re- 
mains undivided. At the period to which we refer the whole pro- 
perty was not worth more than L. 4000. At the present time — 
although the coal is exhausted, from which so much revenue was 
derived — its value cannot be less than L. 14,000 or L. 15,000. 
" Each freedom," says the last Statistical Account, " is valued at 
L. 25, though none have given so much for it." Freedoms may 



OCHILTREE. 



105 



now be estimated at from L. 300 to L. 400, and some have brought 
as much as L. 500. Scarcely any improvement in the system ot 
husbandry can be suggested, which is not already m progress. As 
regards the town, it would be very desirable that it were hghted 
with gas, and that some of the streets were better paved. It is 
proposed to establish immediately a carpet-manufactory, which will 
materially increase the means of employment. And the Glasgow 
and Ayr railway, the terminus of which is to be in this parish, 
will immensely increase the facilities of communication. On the 
whole, as respects local advantages, there is much cause for con- 
gratulation. But it is to the extension of our educational and re- 
ligious institutions, and a higher appreciation of them by those for 
whose benefit they are designed, that we chiefly look, ds calculat- 
ed, under the Divine blessing, most effectually to promote the hap- 
piness and comfort of the labouring classes, and of all ranks of the 
community.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JAMES BOYD, MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
,V arne. —Ochiltree is derived by Chalmers, in his Caledonia, 
from the British UchXe tree, signifying the high town, or dwelling- 
place • by others, from the Gaelic Vclde, Camp, to which tree is 
annexed, thereby forming Uchle-tree or Camp-tree, or from 0' 
Chaaltearan, which signifies a district of a country covered with 
trees of all kinds. Which of these derivations may be the proper 
one it is difficult to determine ; but any of them may be well ap- 
plied to the situation of the place. The first name given answers 
to the site of the old castle of Ochiltree, which is upon the brow 
of the high rocky banks of the Lugar, and the others may have 
arisen from a place called the Camp, and the rising ground, now 
occupied by the houses and gardens of the village, where there

lOG 



AYRSHIRE. 



were at one time many large trees, probably of several hundred 
years of age. 

Boundaries and Extent. — Ochiltree is bounded on the south by 
the parishes of New Cumnock and Dalmellington ; on the east, 
by Old Cumnock and Auchinleck ; on the north, by the parish of 
Stair; and on the west, by Stair and Coylton. Taking the extreme 
points, it extends about 8 miles in length, by 5 in breadth, and 
contains, by the admeasurement of the several estates in it, 15,387 
imperial acres, or 24V square miles. '  

Topographical Appearances.— The greater part of the land lies 
on an elevation of from 400 to 1000 feet above the level of the 
sea, with a northern exposure, forming ridges of different lengths 
and heights, running in general from east to west, arid connected 
with flat pieces of land composed of meadow and moss. 

The temperature is very variable, with considerable falls of rain. 

The soil is chiefly of a clayey nature, and the air often damp 
and chilly. It frequently happens that the crops are late in ripen- 
ing, and not well filled. 

Hydrography. — There are many springs of excellent water in 
the parish. There are two lochs, — one of them about 27 acres 
in extent, and from 2 feet to 20 feet in depth, and the other of 
smaller dimensions. They are only useful as reservoirs for cattle 
in very dry seasons. 

These lochs, which lie quite open, with gently rising grounds 
around them, could be easily drained ; but it may be questionable 
whether the land to be thus gained would repay the expense of 
the necessary outlay. The Lugar runs between the parishes of 
Ochiltree and Auchinleck ; and Coila divides the parish of Ochil- 
tree from that of Coylton. The Burnoch Water, and several other 
small streams or burns, fall at different points into the Lugar or 
Coila, which run into the river Ayr. 

Geology. — Although it be known that there are several seams 
of coal within the parish, none is raised, from the impression that 
they could not be worked to advantage. No limestone has been 
discovered. There is plenty of freestone in various places, par- 
ticularly on the banks of the Lugar, and at Garrochhill. Iron- 
stone, in thin beds, has been discovered in the hills of Polquhairn 
and Greenhill, but not in such quantities as to encourage any work 
to be carried thereon. 

From the declivity of the diff'erent ridges already referred to, 
which mark the appearance of the parish, there has been much 



OCHILTREE. 



107 



alluvial deposit carried into the lower places, which has formed 
meadows and marshes ; but, being of a clayey nature, it continues 
soft, and induces the growth of rushes, sprets, and other grasses 
usually found in wet places. The greater part of the land consists 
of a clayey loam, resting on a stiff clay subsoil, and, without drain- 
ing to a great extent, unfit for the new mode of husbandry, where 
green drilled crops enter into one of the rotations. The uplands 
are generally mossy, resting on clay of a yellow colour, covered 
by mdss of various depths, which often break into what are called 
hags, or flow-moss. 

II. — Civil History. 
The author of Caledonia mentions, " that, as early as the year 
1498, there had been a feud between Hugh Campbell of Louden, 
the sheriff of Ayr, and Sir William Colville of Uchletree, Knight," 
when the King granted an exemption to Sir William Colville and 
his tenants and servants from the jurisdiction of Hugh Campbell 
and his deputies, " because it was notoriously known that there is 
a deadly feud betwixt them." Again, " after the disastrous bat- 
tle of Flodden, many violent acts were committed in Scotland, 
particularly in the south. In Ayrshire, the strong houses of Cum- 
nock and Uchletree were both violently taken possession of; their 
owners having fallen on Flodden field." 

From the same author we learn, " that in 1296, Symon de 
Spalding, the parson of the church of Ochiltree, swore fealty to 
Edward I. at Berwick. During the reign of Robert I. Eustace 
de Colville granted to the monks of Melrose the church of Ochil- 
tree with all its pertinents— a grant which was confirmed by a 
charter from Robert de Colville of Oxnan and of Ochiltree in 
1324. Down to the Reformation, the monks of Melrose enjoyed 
the tithes and revenues, whilst the cure was served by a vicar, who 
had a fixed salary fi-om them. In 1527, James Colville of Ochil- 
tree granted an annualrent of L. 10 for the support of a chap- 
lain to officiate at St Mary's altar, in the church of Ochiltree, and 
the grant was confirmed by the King in 1527-8. In 1530, Sir 
James Colville transferred the barony of Uchletree to Sir James 
Hamilton of Finnart, in exchange for the barony of East Wemyss 
in Fife. In 1534, Sir James Hamilton transferred the barony of 
Ochiltree to Andrew Stewart, Lord Evandale, in exchange for 
the barony of Evandale, and in consequence of this exchange, 
Stewart was, in March 1 542-3, created Lord Stewart of Ochil- 
tree."

AYRSHIRE. 



His son, Andrew, Lord Ochiltree, a zealous reformer, whose 
daughter was married to Knox, appropriated to himself the whole 
of the lands which belonged to the church of Ochiltree. He 
also obtained from David Crichton, vicar, with consent of the Com- 
mendator of Melrose, the patron of that church," a charter of fee 
farming of all the church lands of Ochiltree, except the vicar's 
manse and garden, and this charter was confirmed under the Great 
Seal on the 10th May 1567. His grandson, Andrew Lord Ochil- 
tree, obtained, in 1601, a grant of the kirk lands of Uchletree, 
called the Vicar's Holm, and also the advowson, donation, and pa- 
tronage of the parsonage and vicarage of Ochiltree, and this char- 
ter was ratified in the Parliament of 1606. In 1653, the western 
part of the parish of Ochiltree was detatched from it, and formed 
into a separate parish called Stair. The barony of Ochiltree, as 
well as the patronage of the church, went through many hands, 
and eventually into the possession of William, the first Earl of 
Dundonald, who granted them to his second son. Sir John Coch- 
rane, who lost them by forfeiture in 1685. His son, William, 
having obtained a grant of them from the Crown in 1686, they 
contiimed in the Cochrane family until about one hundred years ago, 
when they were purchased by Governor M'Rae, who left them to 
Miss Macquire, afterwards married to the Earl of Glencairn. 
The barony was again sold about twenty years ago in lots, which 
were purchased by different neighbouring proprietors. 

There is another barony in the parish — namely, that of Traboch, 
which signifies the dicelling place of the tribe, the property of 
Sir James Boswell, Bart. On this estate there is a farm called 
Hoodstone, which the ancestors of the present tenant have rented 
from about the middle of the thirteenth century. About that 
time, three brothers of the name of Hood came from England, 
and settled, one of them, in Hoodstone, and the others, in the 
neighbourhood. According to the tradition in the family, the 
death of their renowned progenitor, Robin Hood, was the imme- 
diate cause of their emigration. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners, few of whom reside in the 
parish, are, the Most Noble the Marquis of Bute; Sir James 
Boswell of Auchinleck ; Dowager Lady Boswell ; David Limond, 
Esq. of Dalblair; James Pettigrew Wilson, Esq. of Polquhairn ; 
Robert Campbell, Esq. of Skerrington ; Andrew Hunter, Esq. of 
Bonnieton ; Robert M'Dirmet Fergushill, Esq. of Burnockston ; 
John D. Boswell, Esq. of Garallan, &amp;c. 



OCHILTREE.

Parochial Registers.— The registers of baptisms and marriages 
go back to the year 1641, but there was no register of deaths tdl 
about forty years ago. The registers began in 1641, were regular- 
ly kept for a considerable time, but were afterwards for a long pe~ 
riod very much neglected. For the last fifty years they have been 
kept in a most regular manner. The first volume having been 
written in an old hand, and difficult to be made out, the present 
schoolmaster was induced to copy the whole thereof into a new 
book, which copy was, by the late Rev. William Thomson, then 
minister of the parish, compared with the original, and attested by 
him on the 3d November 1803. 

Antiquities. — A part of the village is built on what was formerly 
a camp, but of its history there is little or nothing known. At the 
toll-bar, on the road to Ayr, there is a place called the Moat, 
where, a few years ago, was found an urn with calcined bones, and, 
last spring, a ploughman, in turning up the soil, found a crown piece 
of James I. of England, in good preservation, the inscription quite 
legible, and within it the sword and mace. — Of the old castle of 
Ochiltree that stood on the banks of the Lugar, nothing remains 
but the foundation ; the stones having been taken away at different 
times to build houses and dikes on the adjoining farms. There are 
the ruins of an old castle at Auchincloich, but by whom, or for what 
purpose it was built in that hilly district, is not known. There is, 
detached from the rock on the banks of the Lugar, a large stone 
about 60 feet high, by 40 feet in length, and 20 feet in breadth, par- 
tially covered on the top with shrubs, heather, and grass. It is re- 
garded as a great curiosity, and called, from its peculiar form, 
Kemp's Castle. 

Ill, — Population. 
By the returns made to Dr Webster in 1755, the population of 
the parish was 1210 ; and by census taken in the year 1792, there 
were 1144 persons; in the year 1801, 1308;in 1811, 1548;in 1821, 
1588 ; and in 1831, 1562 ; which shews a decrease since the pre- 
vious census in 1821, of 26 souls.

Character of the People. — The inhabitants of this parish are very 
cleanly in their persons, and generally appear at church and mar- 
ket in substantial fine clothes. Indeed, it has been observed that 
the young females, particularly the servant girls, are rather fond of 
dressing finely. It is not unusual to see persons of this description 
arrayed in silk gowns, with other parts of their dress corresponding. 
Their wages are in this way almost wholly spent, instead of provid- 
ing, by the earnings of youth, for the wants of age, or for seasons of 
affliction. The food of the peasantry is generally oatmeal porridge 
and milk to breakfast, broth, with butcher-meat and potatoes to din- 
ner, and porridge or potatoes with milk for supper. In addition to 
these articles, they often use, at their meals, milk with cakes of oat- 
meal, or a mixture of oatmeal and bear meal, made into scones. In 
the families of most mechanics, tea is used, generally twicea-day, but 
the practice does not prevail amongst farm-servants to any extent. 
The inhabitants of this parish are entitled to rank high for their 
intelligence and respectability. Availing themselves of the advan- 
tages which the system of our parochial schools affords in early life, 
and improving the opportunities which afterwards occur for acquir- 
ing information, by reading and conversing with one another, — they 
are generally well acquainted, not only with the business of their 
own profession or trade, but also with the speculations and mea- 
sures that bear upon the agricultural and commercial interests of 
the country. Recent events have given an importance to politics 
which the people of this district deeply feel ; and the state of par- 
ties they observe with a watchful eye. It is only doing the inha- 
bitants of this parish justice to observe, that they are strictly honest 
in their dealings ; that they shew a commendable anxiety to bring 



OCHILTREE. 



Ill 



up their children to habits of industry and integrity ; that they give 
a regular attendance on the public services of religion, and'gene- 
rally manifest a correctness of conduct in the different relations of 
life highly creditable to their principles and character. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The extent of land under cultivation, or occasion- 
ally in tillage, is about 10,242 imperial acres ; of hill pasture, plan- 
tations, and waste lands, 5145 imperial acres. Perhaps 1000 acres 
might be added to the present cultivated land, but such an improve- 
ment, in order to be advantageous, should be made at first on a li- 
mited scale, and under the most economical management. With- 
out adverting to the kind of soil, the distance from lime, and the 
probable additional value imparted to the land, it is not unusual for 
theorists to commence their operations on a large scale, and thus 
create disappointment to themselves, and bring ruin on those with 
whom they may be connected. 

Rent of Land, -c. — The rent of land called arable ranges from 
10s. to L. 2 per acre, but the true average of the whole is about 
15s. per acre. The grazing of a cow or ox is L. 3; of a sheep, 5s. 
per annum. 

Wages. — The wages given to men-servants who are fit to do all 
kinds of work about a farm, average L. 12, 10s. per annum ; and 
to female servants of the same description, L. 7 a~year. These 
servants lodge in their master's houses, and get their food and wash- 
ing. Day-labourers get in summer about Is. 8d., and in winter 
Is. 3d. per day, without food ; masons and wrights get about 2s. 6d. 
per day, when working from home. For building houses and walls 
the charge is L. 1, 10s. per rood ; and 3d. per foot for hewn work. 

Live-Stock. — The sheep kept are mostly of the black-faced 
kind, with a few of the Leicester, Bakewell, Southdown and 
Cheviot, with crosses from all these descriptions. There are a 
few of the black Egyptian breed, at Burnton, and other farms 
in the parish, which are much admired for their fine wool. 
The breed of cattle is of the Ayrshire dairy kind, and the farmers 
are beginning to take greater care in the improvement of their 
stock, by the selection of superior bulls, and attending more par- 
ticularly to the keeping of the cows in the winter and spring. 

Husbandry. — The arable lands in the parish are divided into 
farms of various extent from 10 to 300 acres ; and, according to 
the usual system of management, a third or a fourth of the farm is 
put into white crop at the same time. Before breaking up any 



112 



AYRSHIRE. 



land for a crop, it is generally manured with a compost of lime 
and earth, or with dung ; then two white crops are usually taken, 
with the last of which grass seeds are sown, which yield a crop of 
hay the following season ; then the land remains in pasture for five 
or six years, before it is broken up again. This is the ordinary 
rotation. Other modes of management are adopted, but only 
to a very limited extent; and, therefore, need not be particu- 
larized. The mode taken for reclaiming waste or hill land is by 
first liming the same at the rate of 120 bolls to each acre ; or by 
paring the surface and burning it into ashes, which, with about 
50 bolls of lime to each acre, are spread over it. After two white 
crops are taken, it is sown down and kept in pasturage for sheep 
three or four years. Furrow-draining is not carried on to any 
great extent in the parish. Mr Tennant of Creoch has lately 
drained, according to this system, about 100 acres, at the expense 
of from L. 5 to L. 6 per acre. These drains are made about twenty 
inches deep, and filled up with small broken stones at least ten 
inches in depth. 

The advantages that arise from this system are very great, but 
a tenant under an ordinary lease, would not be justified in at- 
tempting it to any considerable extent. As such improvements 
add permanently to the value of the lands, they should be carried 
on at the expense of the proprietor, and the tenant charged with 
a fair interest on the money laid out on the draining. 

Leases. — Many farms on the estate of Ochiltree were on life- 
time tacks, but these are now nearly all expired by the death of 
the tenants. The leases of other lands in the parish are from 
nine to nineteen years. Short leases are extremely injurious to 
the interests of the proprietor and tenant. As the lease draws 
near to a close, the occupier generally does as little as he can to 
improve his farm, and becomes quite careless about the state of 
his house and fences, being fearful were he to act otherwise, that 
some other person might reap the fruit of his labours. It would 
be for the advantage of both landlord and tenant, that the occu- 
pier, if industrious, should have a preference and obtain a new lease, 
before the expiration of the old one, by a fair valuation of the farm. 
By this plan, the tenant would be encouraged in carrying on his 
improvements, and the land always kept in good condition. The 
farm-houses are mostly covered with thatch, a few with slates, 
which is considered a great improvement, by giving less harbour 
to rats and mice. The fences are partly made by ditches with

white thorn planted on the bank of earth cast out of the ditch, 
and partly by stone dikes ; the former costing 2s. 6d, per fall for 
making with plants and paling; and the latter from 4s. to 10s. 
per fall of 18 feet in length. 

Annual Produce. — The value of the different kinds of produce 
raised in the parish is as follows, viz. 

White crop, with pease and beans, L. 9734 0 0 

Green do. - - - 1290 0 0 

Hay, cultivated and meadow, - - 2284 0 0 

Produce from 1043 cows, at L. 5 each, - 5255 0 0 

140 fat cattle at L. 3, - 420 0 0 

1089 young do, at L. 1, - 1089 0 0 

3448 sheep, at 6s. - 1034 0 0 

167 pigs, at L. 1, 15s. - 292 5 0 

young horses reared, - 300 0 0 

gardens and orchards, - 150 0 0 

wood sold out of plantations, 50 0 0 

L. 21,898 5 0 

Manufactures. — In the village there is a manufactory for making 
reaping-hooks. Those made and finished by Hector Walker 
are sent to different parts of the kingdom, and held in high re- 
pute. There are box-makers, smiths, wrights, masons, shoe- 
makers, tailors, coopers, a baker, customary weavers, and cotton- 
v.eavers, — the latter class employed by the manufacturers of 
Glasgow and Paisley. A considerable number of the young fe- 
males in the village, and in some parts of the country, are employ- 
ed in sewing muslin, — an employment which in most instances un- 
fits them for other occupations, and, besides, it frequently injures 
their health, and leaves them very helpless when they get houses 
of their own, as to the management of their domestic concerns. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is no market held in the parish. The nearest market - 
town of any importance is Ayr, which is 11 miles distant from 
the village. There are about 7 miles of turnpike roads in the pa- 
rish, and 1 6 miles of other public roads, made and upheld by the 
statute-labour converted into money, amounting annually to L. 75 
a year- These funds are very judiciously applied in making and 
repairing roads, throughout the different districts of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State — The church stands in the middle of the 
village. It was built in 1789, and -is capable of holding 900 per- 
sons. It is divided amongst the heritors according to their respec- 
tive valuations, and again amongst the tenants according to the size 
of their farms. The families, in the village, though many sittings 
are attached to their feus, complain, with great reason, of the want 

AYR. H 



114 



AYRSHIRE. 



of accommodation, and it is hoped that some plan will be adopted 
to remedy this evil. Built nearly at the eastern extremity of the 
parish, the church is rather inconveniently placed to a great part 
of the population. This, however, has not hitherto prevented 
even the most distant from giving a regular attendance. 

The manse and office-houses were built about forty years ago, 
and underwent a complete repair in 1833, when an addition was 
made to the manse. The extent of the glebe is about 9 acres, 
which may be valued at about L. 20. 

The stipend previously agreed upon between the heritors and 
the present incumbent, as awarded by the Court of Teinds in Ja- 
nuary 1835, for crop 1834 and thereafter, is sixteen chalders of 
victual, half meal and half barley, with L. 10 for communion ele- 
iTients. 

The first minister recorded in the session books of the parish is 
the Rev. John Blythe. He succeeded Mr Fergushill on the 27th 

• The following memoranda, respecting the late Rev. John Fergushill, were sent to 
by me W. J. Duncan, Esq. of Glasgow. 

" He was the son of David Fergushill, a merchant at, and for some time provost 
of, Ayr ; and of Janet Kennedy, the sister or near relation of Hugh Kennedy, pro- 
vost of Ayr, the ' same excellent person whom Livingston mentions in his Charac- 
teristics. John Fergushill received the first part of his academical education at the 
University of Edinburgh, where he remained for three years, but the plague ha'ing 
caused a temporary interruption of his studies, his father resolved to send him to 
France to be educated at the Protestant Academy of Montauban, where the well- 
known Robert Boyd of Trochrig was then a professor. 

" His father's wish was, that his studies should be superintended by Boyd, who was 
his relation or conneciion ; but I have not been able to ascertain whether he ever en. 
tered upon his education there. He appears to have resided for some time with Gil- 
bert Primrose, the minister of the Protestant Church at Bourdeaux, but as the 
plague reached that place in the early part of the next year, 1605, he probably de- 
termined on returning to Scotland. By a letter to Boyd dated September 1G50, we find 
him residing at home. For several years after this period, he seems to have remamed 
in great uncertainty, as to the course which he should adopt, having, on the one hand, 
the opportunity of following out his father's business of a merchant, and. on the 
other, the desire to study for the ministry, which seems to have been m a great de- 
gree rendered impossible by the weakly state of his constitution. In December 
1608, he wrote to Boyd, requesting his advice : from his letter it appears that his 
health had so much improved that he was able to prosecute his education, but a dif- 
fidence of his own ability for the profession which he had so long desired, still haras- 
sed him, and kept him in doubt. I do not know what answer Boyd returned, or by 
what means Fergushill's resolution was ultimately fixed. His name appears twice in 
the rcTister of matriculations of the University of Glasgow, first m March 1605, and 
second in 161 1 . About three years afterwards, July 31, 1616, the presbytery of 
GlasTow ' ordanit that Messrs John Haye, Thomas Boyde, J/iotic FCifnishiU, for 
thair'' farther qualificatioune befoir admisssioune to ye holie ministne suld mak ane 
lane lessoune uponc some place of Scripture, and sustain the disput upon some con- 
trovertet held,' and Fergushill had for his subject, 2 Cor. 1. 12. his controversie, 
De bonis Operibus. On September 11, 1616, it is recorded that these ' maide thair 
Lattein lessouns upon the texts befoir prescribed.' From this period 1 have met with 
no notice of Fergushill till march 1620, when, as minister of Ochiltree, he was cited 
before the Court of High Commission, at Glasgow, for non-contormity to the 1 erth 
articles. He declined thejurisdiction of the court, and was suspended and sentenced to 
confinement within the town of Perth, but, by the good offices of Irochrig and Mr 



OCHILTREE.  

May 1641. And the following is a list of the gentlemen who have 
since been ministers : The Rev. Robert Miller ; the Rev. Matthew 
Cooper, admitted from Lilliesleaf in 1695 ; and afterwards 
translated to Kinfauns ; the Rev. Samuel Lockhart, who died 
in 1724; the Rev. George Reid, who was ordained on the 16th 
June 1725, and died on the 6th April 1786; the Rev. David 
Grant, admitted from Ettrick in December 1786 ; the Rev, Wil- 
liam Thomson, who was or dained in April 1 792 ; the Rev. John 
Lindsay, admitted from Auchinleck in June 1818; and the pre- 
sent incumbent, who was admitted from Auchinleck on the 18th 
April 1833. 

The inhabitants of this parish are very regular in their attend- 
ance at church. By the last census taken in 1831, the population 
amounted to 1562, and on an average throughout the year, a con- 
gregation, from about 800 to 900 persons, assembles on the Sabbath 
day in the house of God. With the exception of five or six 
families, all the parishioners belong to the Establishment, and even 
of those families, some are in full communion with the church. 
There are 764 communicants. Collections are occasionally made 
for religious purposes, at home and abroad ; and although there 
are no residing heritors, the regular collections for the poor 
amount to about L. 62 Sterling yearly. From Whitsunday 1834 to 
Whitsunday 1835, they amounted to L. 68; and in the year that 
closed, Whitsunday 1836, to L. 75— shewing a gradual increase 
very creditable to the people. 

Educafio7i.— There are two schools in the parish. The paro- 
chial school in the village is attended by about 100 scholars, and 
the branches taught are, English reading, grammar, writing, arith- 
metic, Latin, Greek, and geography. The salary is the maximum, 
and the schoolmaster receives the produce of a mortification, left 
by Mr Patrick Davidson, on the lands of Shield, in the parish of 
Stair, that yields L. 6, 3s. 4d. yearly. The school fees for read- 
John Chalmers, the last part of his sentence was modified, and he was allowed to re- 
turn to his parish of Ochiltree, under certain restrictions. Little is known of him 
for many years after this time. He seems to have continued to preach notwithstand- 
ing his suspension, for we find, from the records of the kirk-session of Ayr, that he 
supplied the kirk with a sermon, ' and held session there January 10, 1625,' the pa- 
rish being then vacant. He was appointed minister of Ayr in August 1639, on the 
translation of Mr Robert Blair to St Andrews, and was received by the Presbytery 
in the following November. Nothing of importance is recorded of him after that 
time, except the administration of the Solemn League and Covenant to his people, 
which was performed with great solemnity in November 1643. He died on the 11 th 
of June 1644. 

" The works from which the preceding memoranda are taken are, the records 
of the Presbytery and University of Glasgow, and Wodrow's MS. Lives of John Fer- 
gushill and Robert Boyd of Trochrig ; the latter of which is at present in prepara- 
tion for the press under my care." — W. J. D.

Ing English and grammar are 2s. a quarter ; with writing added to 
the above branches, 2s. 6d. ; with writing and arithmetic added, 3s. ; 
with Latin, 5s., and for geography, &amp;c. no extra charge is made. 
The amount received by the teacher yearly may be L. 30 : he 
has also L. 6 a year as session-clerk. There is a private school at 
Sinclairston, on the west side of the parish, without any salary at- 
tached to it, and usually attended by about 40 scholars. The 
inhabitants of this parish are very much alive to the advantages 
of education. They make every effort to send their children to 
school, and though some of them "have to go a considerable dis- 
tance, they are regular in their attendance. There are no children 
in the parish above eight years who cannot read, and there is good 
reason to believe, that a single grown up person of a sound mind 
cannot be found who is not able both to write and to read. 

Since the appointment of the present teacher, Mr Patrick Simson, 
to his charge, which was forty- five years ago, many have gone forth 
from the school of Ochiltree who now occupy respectable stations 
in society, as ministers, doctors, merchants, &amp;c. whose attain- 
ments reflect much credit upon the instructor of their youth. There 
is a small library connected with the parish school. Some time 
ago, there were three friendly societies in the parish ; but as they 
were founded upon erroneous calculations, they did not answer 
the purposes for which they were instituted, and they are now 
given up altogether. There is a savings bank, which was esta- 
blished in the year 1831, and is found to be a great benefit to 
trades-people, farm-servants, &amp;c. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are generally about twenty 
persons on the poor's roll, who receive a stated monthly allowance 
of from 4s. to 8s., according to their individual circumstances, with 
a part of their house rent paid. There are many more who receive 
occasional aid in money and coals. The sum distributed amounts 
to about L. 114 yearly, which is made up by collections in the 
church L. 62 ; by proclamations and mortcloth, L. 2 ; by a volun- 
tary contribution from the heritors, L. 50, — last year it amounted 
to L. 127. The burden of providing for three insane persons who 
are taken care of in the village presses very heavy upon the funds, 
and accounts for the largeness of the sum annually expended. 
The persons on the roll are generally old and infirm. They never 
resort to public begging. They do all they can for themselves, 
and trust to the help given by the kirk-session, and to the spon- 
taneous charity of their neighbours and friends. 

The inhabitants of this parish having determined, about three 
years ago, not to supply vagrants, contributed a small sum to pro- 



OCHILTREE. 



cure lodo-ino- for the night, and a little bread, to persons who were 
found, upon strict inquiry, to be in want. Whilst by this arrange- 
ment, provision was made for the really needy wanderer to help 
him on his way, the artful impostor, who was wont to make a 
lucrative trade of begging, found the sources of his gain cut off, 
and was led, in some instances at least, to abandon his improper 
calling altogether. For some months past, this rule has been de- 
parted from, and the consequence is, that vagrants are making their 
appearance in great numbers. It is desirable that all parishes 
should join in the adoption of some plan for putting an end to this 
great and crying evil. 

Fairs.— There are two fairs held in the village of Ochiltree dur- 
ing the year— the one on the second Wednesday of May, and the 
other on the first Tuesday of November. At these fairs, horses, 
and black-cattle of all kinds are sold, servants engaged, and such 
other matters transacted as are usually settled by farmers, &amp;c. at 
similar meetings throughout the county. 

Inns and Alehouses.— There are six places of this description in 
the village, but none in any other part of the parish. These have 
had no visible effects upon the morals of the people. At the same 
time, it is much to be wished, that fewer of such houses were licen- 
sed. The opportunities and enticements which they offer to the 
idle and thoughtless for spending their evenings together, may lead 
to the most injurious consequences. 

Fuel. — Coal is the principal artice of fuel. Some peats are used. 
The coals which are procured from Drongan, in the parish of Stair, 
and at Garallan, in the parish of Old Cumnock, cost at the pit 
about 5s. per -ton, and the carriage of a ton to the village is 6s. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the Statistical Account given by the Rev. William Thom-' 
son, the parish roads have been very much improved, and a better 
and more regular system of cultivating the land has been adopted, 
from which the best effects have followed. Great improvement 
has taken place in the stock of horses, cows, &amp;c. and especially in 
the management of the dairy, which has given the very first place 
in the market to the cheese of this district. The rental of the pa- 
rish has increased from about L. 3000 to L. 8176, 10s. Sterling, 
and the inhabitants undoubtedly enjoy, in a much greater degree, 
what are usually considered the comforts of life. Much may be 
yet done in the way of improvement, by draining, fallowing, and 
planting, which in he course of a few years would be a great be-- 
nefit to the proprietors and tenants of the parish.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. STAIR M'QUHAE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish is now generally written St 
Quivox, but sometimes St Evox. At an earlier period it appears 
always to have been written St Kevoch. The name is supposed to 
be derived from " Sancta Kennocha Virgo in Coila," who lived in 
the reign of Malcolm II., and was distinguished for her zeal in 
promoting monastic institutions. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish is about 5 miles in length, and 3 in 
breadth, and contains about 5000 acres. It is bounded on the 
south by the river Ayr, and on the east, north, and west, by 
the parishes of Tarbolton, Monkton, and Newton. 

Topographical Appearances. — In general, the surface of the pa- 
rish is level, but towards the eastern ex:tremity it becomes more 
elevated and uneven. The temperature is mild, the snow scarcely 
ever lying more than two days. Westerly winds prevail, which 
bring frequent showers from the Atlantic. But the heavier rains 
are with a southerly wind, and with east wind the barometer al- 
most uniformly rises. The soil nearest the sea is generally light 
and sandy, with moss and clay dikes in particular parts. These 
parts are naturally wet from the clay beds which confine the 
springs ; aad the small portion of higher land in the parish is a 
' stiff clay soil. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological and mineral cha- 
racter of the parish is of the order of stratified rocks belonging to 
the coal formation. The workable seams of coal intermediate 
with the other strata are only two, — the uppermost, a seam of 
about four feet in thickness, being tender and frangible, whilst 
the second seam, of nearly the same thickness, is very hard, and 
not easily broken, being of the quality termed splint-coal. The 
two seams are more than twenty fathoms from each other. These 
seams of coal are the same which have been extensively worked 



ST QUIVOX. 



119 



in the adjoining parishes of Newton and Prestwick. In the pa- 
rish of St Quivox the uppermost seam of coal has been nearly ex- 
hausted by workings, which were carried on about fifty or sixty 
years ago. The lower seam has been only within these few years 
fitted, aiid there may remain to be worked about 1000 acres. The 
coal field is terminated on the north by a great dike or slip, which 
passes near the church of St Quivox, running in a direction nearly 
north-west; although trials have been made over this dike, no 
workable seam of coal has been found. There are no other mi- 
nerals in the parish which are considered to be of value. 

Yellow trout are found in the water of Ayr, and afford good 
sport to the angler, but there is no salmon fishery of any import- 



ance. 



The fruit trees are much infested by a small caterpillar, f Aphis 
lanigera, of which the larvse appear to be deposited in the bud 
by the parent fly in autumn, and which, destroys the blossom and 
leaves when they expand in spring, producing a devastation which 
is vulgarly called Miffht. Of late years the young wheats and 
turnips have suffered greatly from the wire-worm, which attacks 
the roots in April and July, and often destroys the, white crop. 
It prevails chiefly in the dry light soils, and seems to be increased 
in the vicinity of the town by the use of ashes as manure. 

No adequate cure for the evil has been discovered ; but the con- 
suming of the turnip on the ground by sheep, by consolidating the 
soil, seems to impede the operations of this destructive insect. The 
crows, larks, and pheasants, devour vast numbers of these worms, 
but they destroy also the young plants, by plucking them up in 
search of their prey. The crows in general discover the presence 
of the insect by the unhealthy appearance of the blade, and pull 
only the injured plant. But when they happen to alight in great 
numbers and in a hiingry state, upon a field of young turnips, which 
have recently been thinned, they frequently destroy the whole crop 
in a very short time. 

II. — CiYiL History. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, Mr Oswald of 
Auchencruive; Mr Forbes of Callendar; Messrs Hunters and Com- 
pany, Bankers, Ayr ; and Mr Campbell of Craigie. 

Parochial Registers. — Th6 parochial registers do not extend 
farther back than the year 1780, but since that period they have 
been kept with great regularity. 

Antiquities. — Several small earthen urns were lately discovered

AYRSHIRE. 



in levelling a sand-bank at Content, supposed to be Roman. They 
are now in the possession of Dr Memes, Rector of the Ayr Aca- 
demy. There are spacious mansion-houses at Auchencruive and 
Craigie. Both are finely situated on the banks of the Ayr, and 
the gardens and grounds at Auchencruive, laid out with much taste, 
are objects of attraction to strangers. 

III. — Population. 

In 1755 the population of the parish of St Quivox amounted 
to 499 souls. But soon after that period, Sir Thomas Wallace 
of Craigie began to feu at the bridge end of Ayr, and at present, 
besides an agricultural population of 1071, Wallacetown and 
Content contain 4277, making in all 5348 souls. Tliis increase 
has arisen from the coal-works in the parish, and in the neigh- 
bouring parish of Newton, from the general growth of the ma- 
nufactures of the country, and from the demand for labourers, in 
consequence of agricultural improvements. The inhabitants of 
Wallacetown and Content belong chiefly to the poorer class of 
Irish settlers, and consist of colliers, labourers, and weavers em- 
ployed by the manufacturing houses in Glasgow and Paisley. 
There are also a considerable number of artisans, carters, publi- 
cans, and shopkeepers, besides an undue proportion of strangers 
from Ireland, who have only a precarious means of subsistence, 
and are induced to take up their temporary abode here, by the 
cheapness of lodging, and the liberality of the public of Ayr in 
supplying their wants. 

There are only five proprietors of land, all of the yearly value 
of L. 50 and upwards, — and Mr Oswald and Mr Campbell are 
the only residing heritors. 

Number of families in the parish, - - _ 1146 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - Ii2 

trade, manufacture, or handicraft, 479 

IV. — Industry. 

The whole of the parish is in tillage, with the exception of about 
250 acres covered with plantations of various ages, consisting of 
the ordinary kinds of forest trees, which are carefully thinned, and 
are in a thriving condition. 

Rent. — The average rent of land may be stated at about L. 2, 
5s. per acre. The grazing of a milch cow is from L. 4 to L. 5 ; 
a two-year old L. 2 ; a-year old L. 1, 10s. 

Live stock. — The Ayrshire breed of cattle are in general use, 
being preferred even for fattening, as it is believed that they rise 
to more weight in proportion to the food they consume, and are 

3

ST QUIVOX. 



fit for the butcher at an earher age than any other stock with - 
which they have been compared. Eleven or twelve pounds is no 
uncommon price for bullocks sold to the butcher, in the month of 
April, then just two years old, and which have been well reared 
with milk, and fed during the winter with turnip. Only a few 
sheep, as pets, are bred in the parish, and those fed on turnip are 
generally of the black-faced kind, bred in the Highlands or Gal- 
loway. 

jy«s5anJry.— Husbandry is in a flourishing state, and the land, 
in possession of a very intelligent and industrious tenantry, has 
of late years been much improved. On the light soils, which 
comprehend a large proportion of the parish, a five years' rotation 
is generally observed:—, oats; 2. green crop, consisting of 
turnips, potatoes, carrots or mangel-wurzel ; 3. wheat or barley ; 
4. hay, or sown grasses pastured with sheep or cows ; 5. pasture. 
Manure for the green crops is purchased in Ayr at about 3s. per 
cart, but on the farms near the town, the inhabitants are allowed 
to plant their own potatoes with their manure. The farmer works 
the land, leads the manure, for which he is paid, and charges the 
cottager Is. per boll for potatoes produced, as rent. Turnips, 
chiefly Swedish, are the prevailing green crops. Of these one-half 
are drawn to feed bullocks or dairy stock, and the other half are 
consumed on the ground by sheep. On the farm of Shields, si- 
tuated about four miles from Ayr, occupied by Mr J. Tenant, an 
extensive dairy has been substituted for the feeding of bullocks. 
About 60 cows are kept in the highest condition, being fed in the 
winter with boiled Swedish turnip, carrot, mangel-wurzel, and 
bean meal, and are always fit for the butcher when the milk fails. 
The whole of the milk is churned ; the buttermilk sold in Ayr ; 
and the butter, which, by the mixture of a small quantity of salt- 
petre with the milk, has been entirely freed from any unpleasant 
turnip flavour, is carried to Edinburgh and Glasgow markets. 
On this farm the practice of feeding sheep on turnip, and pastur- 
ing the sown grasses, instead of cutting hay, was first introduced 
into the parish ; and the land, having now passed three or four 
times through the rotation on this system, is so much improved, 
that 60 milch cows are kept well on the same number of acres 
which, at the commencement,' barely supported 40. 

The light soils in some parts kept in a marshy state by 
springs, have been dried by deep box drains covered with small 
stones; and on the stiff" soils, the practice of furrow- draining, with 



122 



AYRSHIRE, 



small brick, stones, or tile, has come into general use. On the estate 
of Blackhouse, above 15,000 falls of drains of various descriptions 
have been laid within the last two years. The expense is incurred 
by the proprietors, who indemnify themselves by a small additional 
rent, or receive assistance from the tenants in the leading of the 
materials. 

The leases of land are generally for nineteen years. On the 
estate of Auchencruive, the tenants are rarely changed, and the 
proprietor seeks rather to retain men of spirit and industry, and to 
enable them to cultivate the land with success, than to let the farm 
to the highest bidder. The farm-buildings in the whole of the pa- 
rish are commodious and in good repair ; and the thorn hedges, 
■which form the enclosures, are well kept, and have been gradually 
improving by the practice which prevails of dressing them when 
green, with the hedge-hook, in the month of August. 

Quarries. — There are several quarries of excellent freestone in 
the parish,' and three coal-pits constantly worked, which produce 
coal of good quality. 

Produce. — The amount of raw produce raised in the parish may 
be stated as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, being 480 acres of wheat at L. 11, and 

566 acres of oats at L. 8, 10s. per acre, . L. 10091 0 0 

Green crop, ..... 4704 0 0 

Hay, . . • • • 1150 0 0 

Land in pasture at L. 2 per acre, . • • 3018 0 0 

Gardens and orchards, .... 100 0 0 

Thinning and felling of wood, . . • • 1130 0 0 

Produce of coal mines and quarries, .... 3405 0 0 

L. 23598 0 0 

In the above statement grass lands are estimated at too low a 
rate, as they actually produce much more with dairy stock than if 
they were employed in grazing at the usual rate of cattle. It is 
difficult, however, to render this part of the estimate more accurate, 
as the produce of the dairy stock arises also from the consumption 
of turnip, carrot, potatoes, &amp;c. which- are already valued sepa- 
rately. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Town. — The whole of the parish being near to Ayr, and 
the most populous part of it forming a suburb of that town, it en- 
joys the advantage of a convenient market for all commodities, and 
of a daily post. The thriving village of Whitelets is situated a mile 
and a-half from Ayr, and the roads from Ayr to Mauchline and to 
Galston, which are" kept in excellent repair, pass through the whole 



ST QUIVOX. 



123 



length of the parish. There is also a railroad from Whitelets to 
the harbour of Ayr, for the conveyance of coal. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church was built before the 
Reformation, but was repaired and enlarged about twelve years ago, 
and now affords good accommodation for nearly 500 sitters. It is 
situated near the centre of the parish ; but the mass of the popu- 
lation, being at one extremity, are three miles distant from the 
church, in which they have no accommodation. To remedy this 
evil, which had been long felt by that large portion of the inha- 
bitants of Wallacetown who belong to the Established Church, a 
chapel was built by subscription in that district in the year 1835, 
which affords accommodation to nearly 900 sitters. The General 
Assembly granted a constitution to this chapel in the year 1836, 
and Wallacetown has since been disjoined quoad sacra from the 
parish of St Quivox, and erected into a separate parish. The 
Rev. John Alexander was ordained minister of Wallacetown by 
the presbytery of Ayr in the same year ; and the whole of the sit- 
tings in the new church are already let— chiefly to parishioners. 

An excellent manse was built in the parish of St Quivox in the 
year 1823. The glebe consists of four acres, which may be va- 
lued at a yearly rent of L. 10 ; and the stipend, which was aug- 
mented in 1835, consists of 18 chalders. 

There are in Wallacetown an Antiburgher meeting-house, an 
United Secession church, a reformed Presbyterian meeting-house, 
a small Independent church, a small Episcopal chapel, and a 
handsome Roman Cathohc chapel. The congregations attending 
the places of worship assemble from this and eight or nine of the 
surrounding parishes. The ministers are paid chiefly from the 
seat-rents, but the exact amount of stipends cannot be ascertained. 

The number of families in the parish belonging to the different 
religious denominations is as follows -.—Established Church, 724 
families; Roman Catholics, 125; Rehef, 112; United Secession 
church, 71 ; Antiburghers, 40 ; Episcopalian, 20 ; Reformed Pres- 
bytery, 25; Methodists, 18; Independents, 6; Moravians, 3; 
Universalists, 2; total, 1146 families. 

The Established Church is well attended by the agricultural po- 
pulation, who alone have seats ; and the collections for charitable 
purposes amount to about L. 50 per annum. 

Education.— 'T\iQve are one parochial and eight unendowed 
schools in the parish, in which Latin, mathematics, book-keep- 
ing, arithmetic, geography, reading, and writing are taught. The 



124 



AYRSHIRE. 



parochial teacher has all the legal accommodations, with a salary 
of L. 30 per annum. The other teachers are supported solely by 
fees. The expense of education varies from 12s. to L.l, 2s. per 
annum, according to the advancement of the pupil. The whole 
of the native population can read ; but there areome of the Irish 
settlers, and a few of the younger members of their families, who 
have not been instructed in reading. In general, education is 
sought after ; and the Sabbath schools, of which there are several, 
are well attended, and have occasioned a visible improvement in 
the moral habits of the poorer classes. 

There is a small parochial library lately established ; but, with 
regard to this and the other branches of parochial economy, it 
may be observed, that, owing to their close vicinity to Ayr, many 
of the parishioners avail themselves of the schools, mechanics' 
institutions, libraries, and religious associations established in that 
town, while they enjoy the benefits of the dispensary and savings 
bank for Ayr, Newton, and Wallacetown, 

Friendly Societies. — Several friendly societies have existed in the 
parish ; but it generally happens, that when the weekly assessment 
in support of their funds increases much, in consequence of age, 
infirmity, or prevailing sickness amongst the members, these insti- 
tutions are broken up. In order to remedy this defect incident to 
all such societies in which the weekly contribution varies, and in 
times of exigency rises to an amount inponvenient for the mem- 
bers, a funded female friendly society was established a few years 
since under the patronage of Lady Lilias Oswald, to which the 
ordinary members pay a regular quarterly assessment of Is. 2d., and 
receive an aliment of 4s. per week in sickness, besides an allowance 
for marriage and funeral expenses. There are a number of ho- 
norary members who contribute a higher rate, with the view of 
giving effect to the institution ; and as there is chiefly owing to 
the liberality of the patroness a stock of about L. 320, it is 
hoped that the funds will be able to meet the increased demand 
upon them, which must be expected, as the present members be- 
come aged and infirm. 

Poor. — There are about 80 regular and temporary paupers on 
the roll, who receive at an average Is. per week, — 10s. being the 
highest, and Is. 6d. the lowest monthly allowance. For the last 
twenty years, there has been an assessment for the support of the 
poor, which is levied on the real rent of land and houses, one-half 
payable by the proprietors, and the other half by the occupiers. 



ST QUIVOX. 



125 



From the year 1812, the annual expenditure for the poor had 
gradually increased till the year 1822, for which year it amounted 
to L. 383, the assessment being at the rate of ld. per pound 
Sterling of real rent. From the year 1823, the expenditure has 
gradually decreased till the year 1830, when it amounted to L.219, 
and the assessment for this current year, 1831, has been fixed at 
5d. per pound on land, and 4d. per pound on houses, — an inferior 
rate being levied on houses, in consideration of the perishable na- 
ture of that description of property. There is unfortunately little 
disposition in the parish to abstain from asking parochial relief; 
and the facts stated above afford a practical refutation of the as- 
sertion which has been so frequently made, that the expense of 
the poor must of necessity increase whenever funds for their sup- 
port are raised by legal assessment. Owing to the influx of poor 
Irish, it would be difficult to find in Scotland a place more abound- 
ing in pauperism than Wallacetown ; and in the present most un- 
fair and injurious state of the law of settlement, the expenditure 
of the poor can only be kept within reasonable bounds by a strict 
application of the funds to the relief of those aged and infirm per- 
sons and infants for whom the law provides, and whose claims to 
parochial aid is the same, whether the funds for their support are 
derived from legal assessment or voluntary contribution. 

Lins. — The number of public houses in the parish is unreason- 
ably great. This no doubt arises from the great demand for ar- 
dent spirits which already exists ; but it is obvious that the increase 
of those houses, by the facilities thus afforded for the indulgence 
of intemperance, must aggravate the evil. 

Fuel — There is abundance of coal in the parish and neigh- 
bourhood, which is sold at the pits from 6s. to 9s. per ton, accord- 
ing to the distance from the harbour of Ayr, where it is shipped 
for the Irish market. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since the date of the last Statistical Account, the State of agri- 
culture is prodigiously improved, and the greater portion of the 
parish now resembles a well cultivated garden. The population 
has increased threefold, and the rental of land is more than 
doubled. 

• Since 1831, the expenditure for the poor has gradually increased.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JOHN STEWART, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The parish of Sorn, in all likelihood, derives its name 
from the Celtic word Sorn, signifying a snout, projection, or dis- 
agreeable visage, and may have been so called from the projection, 
promontory, or eminence, on which the castle stands. In Alex- 
ander and Donald Stewart's Collection of the Highland Bards, we 
find a song addressed to a gentleman dwelling in a farm in Mull, 
called Sorn. In the parish of Morven, and on the side of Loch- 
Sunart, there is a farm situated on an eminence called Soma. 
There is also a place in Cornwall where the Celtic language was 
spoken until the beginning of last century, and in some instances 
preached, called Some. The original name of the parish was Dal- 
gain, the ground on which the church, manse, and glebe stand, 
having been a grant from the late Hugh Mitchell, Esq. of Dal- 
gain, and is supposed to have been changed in consequence of the 
vicinity of Sorn Castle, an ancient seat of the Loudon family, to 
the church. Dalgain, like Sorn, is of Celtic origin, being evidently 
derived from Dal and gaineimh, the field of sand or gravel, — a 
name strikingly descriptive of the soil on which the old house of 
Dalgain stands. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Sorn is nearly a square, whose side is 
about 6 miles, and is intersected by the river Ayr. It is bound- 
ed on the east, by the parish of Muirkirk ; on the west, by the 
parish of Mauchline ; on the north, by the parish of Galston ; and 
on the south, by the parish of Auchinleck. 

Topographical Appearances. — The external appearance of the 
parish is considerably diversified by its rising grounds, and its level 
holms on the banks of the Ayr, as well as by the large extent of moors 
and mosses which adjoin the land now under cultivation, and which 
have been greatly improved of late years. The only hill of any 
considerable height in the parish is Blackside-end, situated on the 



SOUN. 



12T 



north-east boundary of the parish, from whose summit, which has 
been rated at about 1500 or 1600 feet above the level of the sea, 
there is in clear weather a very extensive view ; some individuals- 
maintaining that no less than sixteen counties may be seen from it. 
The scenery along the banks of the Ayr is remarkably picturesque, 
and is peculiarly so about Sorn Castle and the manse. 

Meteorology. — The climate may in general be characterized as 
healthy, although, as in the greater part of the west of Scotland, 
there are frequent and heavy falls of rain. The prevailing winds 
are the west and south-west. Snow seldom falls to any consider- 
able depth, and when it does fall, remains only a very short time 
upon the ground. 

The following extract for the last three years from a meteoro- 
logical table kept at the Catrine works may serve to convey a very 
accurate idea of the climate : —

AYRSHIRE. 



Hydrography. — The only river in the parish is the Ayr, which, 
entering at its eastern extremity, runs through it in a westerly di- 
rection. This river, whose bed is of round stones and gravel, rises 
in the parish of Muirkirk, and is considerably increased in its 
course by the Greenock and Garpel, two rivulets which run into it 
about six miles from its source, as well as by several streamlets, 
which, now that furrow-draining has been so generally introduced 
into this country, immediately after a heavy fall of rain, swell the 
Ayr into an immense body of water. The usual velocity of this 
river is about a mile an hour, but when swelled by a heavy fall of 
rain, or the melting of snow on the neighbouring hills, its velocity 
is increased to six or seven miles an hour. The scenery along its 
banks, which in many places are steep and bold, is remarkably pic- 
turesque and beautiful. There are several burns of water in the pa- 
rish, the principal of which is the Cleugh, which runs into the Ayr 
close by Sorn Castle. This burn, which passes through a deep glen 
finely wooded on each side, though on a small scale, exhibits in some 
points scenery not greatly inferior to the much admired scenery at 
the Falls of the Clyde. Here are to be found beautiful specimens 
of what is commonly called petrified fog, or more properly calc- 
tuff, which are generally attached to the precipice, where it is form- 
ed by the deposition of the carbonate of lime, held in solution by 
the water which oozes from the rock upon the moss with which it 
is covered. 

Geology, Soil, -c— The primitive rocks do not make their ap- 
pearance in the parish in situ, although the debris of several va- 
rieties of granite is found in abundance in the diluvial deposit. The 
whole district, however, is rich in the more useful minerals of the 
secondary formation, and is chiefly remarkable for the very exten- 
sive beds of limestone which are found on both sides of the river, 
and which have been wrought for economical purposes during a 
century. Coal seams also occur to some extent in the parish, and 
at no great distance under the surface. In the same locality,, seams 
of clay ironstone alternating with slate-clay are found in very 
great abundance, and are said to contain a very large per centage 
of metal. The ironstone has never been fused on the spot; but 
some years ago a considerable quantity was made use of by the 
Muirkirk Iron CoiTipany at their works, about eight miles higher 
up the river. Strata of sandstone of considerable variety of struc- 
ture are also found in the vicinity of the coal, and towards the west- 
ern part of the parish, where the coal and lime disappear, the

sandstone becomes less indurated, and better fitted for being 
wrought into building stones. 

In the holms, on the banks of the river Ayr, the soil is of a 
graveUish nature. On the higher ground it is generally reddish 
clay, and near the hills it assumes a mossy character until it ter- 
minates in moss. Underneath parts of this moss, however, there 
is in many places a substratum of clay, which, when ploughed up 
and mixed with a liberal portion of lime, produces excellent crops 
of oats and a beautiful sward of grass. 

Zoology. — There are no rare animals found in the parish. There 
is in it a great abundance of hares and rabbits. It is only with- 
in these few years that rabbits first made their appearance in the 
parish in a wild state, but to such an extent have they increased, 
as in several instances to prove injurious to the crops and planta- 
tions. The fox, polecat, and weasel, white and brown, are all to 
be met with in the parish. 

The adder abounds in the moors and mosses. 
Birds of all kinds peculiar to the district abound in the parish. 
In consequence of the great additions which have been made to 
the plantations of late years, the number of birds has greatly in- 
creased, and they are now very destructive to the farms and gar- 
dens. Game birds of all kinds are also to be found in great 
numbers in the moors, fields, and plantations. Of late, there has 
been a great increase of pheasants, which are now frequently to 
be seen running upon the public roads in considerable numbers. 
Black-cock too have increased lately on the high grounds, but 
have not, as in other districts, displaced the red grouse, which still 
abound in the parish. 

The fresh water trout, which at one time abounded in the river 
Ayr, but which had for a number of years disappeared in conse- 
quence of the tar-works at Muirkirk, now that these works have 
been discontinued, have again returned, and are caught in abun- 
dance in the Ayr, as it flows through Sorn and the adjacent pa- 
rishes. 

Botany. — There is nothing in the botany of this parish worthy 
of particular notice. An eminent botanist, who examined its vege- 
table productions lately, was unable to discover any plants but 
such as are to be found in other districts ; the appearance and 
vegetable productions of the banks of the Ayr, from Sorn village 
to Catrine, being in his opinion similar to those of the banks of 
the Esk on the east coast.

Woods and Plantations, Sc.—A vast addition has been made to 
the plantations in the parish, since the last Statistical Account 
was written. At that time there were but few trees and no plan- 
tations, save those which had been planted in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of Sorn Castle by the late Countess Dowager of Lou- 
don. This distinguished lady, after having lived for a considerable 
time at the courts of Queen Anne and George L, took up her re- 
sidence at Sorn Castle in 1727, when she commenced, and car- 
ried on with wonderful activity and skill, till within a short period 
of her death, those improvements in hedging and planting which 
to this day adorn the surrounding landscape. The good work 
commenced by the Countess of Loudon has been followed up by 
the present possessor of Sorn Castle, Mrs A. Somervell, who, with 
great taste and judgment, has laid off extensive plantations and 
beautiful hedges, not merely in the vicinity of the castle, but to a 
considerable distance along the roads leading to Galston and 
Mauchhne, and also on the higher lands of the parish. These 
plantations are in a very thriving condition, and will soon prove an 
ornament and a shelter to this once bleak and dreary district of 
country. Besides those on Sorn Castle estate, there are about 
100 acres of very thriving plantations on the estate of Dalgam, 
now also the property of Mrs A. Somervell, which were laid off 
about twenty years ago by a former proprietor, the late Mr Ste- 
venson, and have tended materially to improve the land, and have 
added nuch to the beauty of the scenery. There are also seve- 
ral plantations of smaller extent on other properties in the parish. 
Larch and Scotch fir are the predominating trees in these planta- 
tions, although there is also in them a proportion of oak, ash, elm, 
beech, and birch. It is much to be regretted, however, that a 
greater quantity of hard-wood has not been planted m these and 
in other plantations in this district of the country, and, when plant- 
ed that care has not been taken to cut down m tune the firs and 
larches. Had attention been paid to this, many plantations in 
Ayrshire, which are now in a state of decay, would have been in a 
high state of preservation. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-owners.-Theve are no less than twenty heritors in the 
parish ; of these, Mrs A. Somervell of Sorn Castle and Dalgmn, 
patroness and proprietress of about two-fifths of the parish ; Miss 
Gray Farquhar of Gilmillscroft ; Robert Campbell, Esq- of uch- 
mannoch; George Rankin, Esq. of Burnhead; Archibald Bucha-

nan, Esq. of Catrine Bank; Lieut- Colonel Stewart of Catrine ; 
and four other small proprietors, are resident. The non-residing 
heritors are, the Duke of Portland ; the Marquis of Bute ; Sir 
James Boswell, Bart, of Auchinleck ; William Campbell, Esq. of 
Fairfield; Lieut.- Colonel M'Adam Cathcart of Craigengillan ; 
Claud Alexander, Esq. of Ballochmyle ; William Campbell, Esq. 
of Nether Place ; Thomas Falconer, Esq. of Auchencloigh ; Miss 
Innes of Stow; and Alexander Murdoch, Esq. of Briggs. 

Antiquities. — There is nothing particularly worthy of being no- 
ticed under this head, except Sorn Castle. This castle, which 
stands upon a rock overhanging the river Ayr, and within a short 
distance of the church and manse, is supposed to have been erect- 
ed at a very early period, but by whom is unknown. There is, 
however, a tradition, that the labourers who were engaged in build- 
ing it had their option either of a peck of meal or ld. per day. 
The following short but well-authenticated narrative of its proprie- 
tors was communicated to Dr Gordon, the eloquent and benevo- 
lent writer of the last Statistical Account of the parish : " About 
the year 1406, the lands of Sorn, with several others in the dis- 
trict of Kyle, were acquired by Andrew Hamilton, third son of Sir 
David Hamilton of Cadzow, ancestor to the Duke of Hamilton. 
This Andrew Hamilton married Agnes, a daughter of Sir Hugh 
Campbell, Sheriff of Ayr, and by him had a son. Sir Robert Ha- 
milton of Sorn and Sanquhar. Sir Robert married a daughter of 
Sir William Crawfurd of Loch Norris; and Sir William Hamil- 
ton of Sorn and Sanquhar, a son of this marriage, was one of the 
Senators of the College of Justice, and Lord Treasurer to King 
James V. This Lord Treasurer married a daughter of the fami- 
ly of Cassillis, by whom he had an heiress, Isobel Hamilton, who 
married George Lord Seaton, and by him was mother to Robert, 
first Earl of Winton, to Alexander, first Earl of Dunfermline, and 
Margaret, the wife of Claud Hamilton, Lord Paisley, ancestor to 
' the Earl of Abercorn. The lands of Sorn were sold hy the suc- 
ceeding Earl of Winton to the family of Loudon, and, after re- 
maining in this family upwards of 150 years, they were sold to 
William Tennent, Esq. of Poole, in 1782." Sorn Castle and 
estate, after being a short time in the possession of Mr Tennent, 
were sold by him to Mr Graham of Limekilns and Mr Stevenson 
of Dalgain, from whom they were purchased by the family of the 
present proprietrix about forty years ago. Sorn Castle was one of 
those places belonging to private individuals which Charles IL, in 



134 AYRSHIRE. 

virtue of an obsolete act, took possession of, and which, amid the 
severe struggle made during the latter part of his reign by the 
Presbyterians for their privileges, was provided with a garrison and 
a governor for the purpose of overawing them. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish registers commence in 
1692, when Mr Mungo Lindsay was ordained minister of the pa- 
rish, and have since been regularly kept. The register of bap- 
tisms is not by any means complete, as parents belonging to diffe- 
rent dissenting bodies frequently neglect the registration of their 
children. Care, however, is taken to enforce this duty on parents 
belonging to the Establishment. There is no record of deaths, 
although the minister, in the course of his visitations, is in the ha- 
bit of taking an exact account of them. 

Eminent Men. — The only person of eminence to whom this pa- 
rish gave birth was Mr Alexander Peden,— a name familiar to the 
people of Scotland, and particularly so to the people of this district. 
The place of his birth, which happened in 1626, has been disput- 
ed,— some maintaining that it was at the farm of Auchencloigh, 
others that it was in one of the small cottages, which, in the re- 
membrance of persons now living, stood not far from Sorn Castle. 
Mr Peden having received at the University the education which 
was necessary to qualify him for the office of the holy ministry, was 
for some time parish schoolmaster, precentor, and session-clerk at 
Tarbolton, and, according to Wodrow, precentor also at Fenwick. 
In 1663, he was settled minister of New Luce, in Galloway, but m 
about three years afterwards, he was, like other eminent servants 
of God in those troublous and persecuting times, forced to aban- 
don a flock most ardently and devotedly attached to him. From 
the time of his being thrust out of New Luce, he wandered about 
from place to place, sometimes in Scotland, and sometimes in Ire- 
land till June 1673, when he was seized in Carrick, and conveyed 
from thence to Edinburgh. After undergoing a series of hard- 

. A great extent of judicial power seems to have been vested Jf 
as appears from a document now in the possession of Robert Campbell, ii-sq. ot 
Auchmannoch, of which the following is a copy :

ships of various kinds, and being cruelly treated in various ways, 
he returned to Scotland, which he reached in 1685, — the year 
when the persecution raged hottest in this and other districts of 
the country. At the imminent risk of his life, yet under the guid- 
ance and protection of a gracious God, who wrought out many 
signal deliverances for him, he visited different districts of Ayr- 
shire and Galloway, preaching, and warning men in the most 
solemn manner of the awful judgments which the Lord, in conse- 
quence of the impenitency and apostacy of the people of Scotland, 
would at no very distant period bring upon them. At length worn 
out and exhausted, and apprehensive that his latter end was draw- 
ing nigh, he returned to his brother's house in this parish. But 
as Sorn Castle, in the immediate neighbourhood of which it was si- 
tuated, had, as has been already stated, a garrison of soldiers and 
a governor for the purpose of overawing the people of the surround- 
ing district, and of bringing such leading men as Peden to condign 
punishment, he was aware that his arrival would soon become 
known, and that, unless he had some place of concealment, he 
must be detected. For this purpose, he caused a cave to be dug, 
and there he was in the habit of hiding himself. Though every 
moment in danger of being laid hold upon, he paid frequent visits 
to his friends, and uttered many prophecies respecting the fate 
which awaited the church and people of Scotland. On his death- 
bed, Peden was visited by James Renwick, that eminent saint 
and servant of God, and last martyr to the cause of civil and re- 
ligious liberty in Scotland, whose presence was a great source of 
comfort and refreshment to his spirit. After having very narrow- 
ly escaped detection from his persecutors, who had searched every 
place in and about his brother's house for him, he died there in 
1686, in the sixtieth year of his age. The laird of Auchinleck, who 
was favourable to the Presbyterian cause, allowed Mr Peden's re- 
mains to be deposited in the family burial-place within the church 
of Auchinleck. But the spirit of persecution, which raged with 
such fury in this district of Scotland at this period, followed Mr 
Peden even to his grave. Forty days after his burial, his corpse 
was raised by a troop of dragoons, with the intention, it is believed, 
of hanging it in chains on the gallows at Cumnock. But this 
act of barbarity on the part of Mr Peden's persecutors was pre- 
vented through the intercession of the Countess of Dumfries and 
the Lady of the Laird of Affleck, and the dead body was taken 
down and re-interred at the foot of the gallows. Such, however, 



136 



AYRSHIRE. 



was the veneration in which the memory of this good man was held 
by the people of the surrounding district, that, in selecting a piece 
of burying-ground for the parish of Cumnock, the spot where Mr 
Peden's ashes lay was made choice of for the purpose, so that 
these now lie in the church-yard of Cumnock. 

Dr Matthew Stewart, late Professor of Mathematics in the Uni- 
versity of Edinburgh, and so well known over all Europe for his 
original genius and high attainments in geometrical science, though 
not a native, was a frequent visitor in the parish. At his death his 
property came into the possession of his son, the late Professor 
Dugald Stewart, one of the most distinguished metaphysicians of 
his day. Though not generally resident in the parish, in the ear- 
lier and more advanced period of his hfe. Professor Dugald 
Stewart spent a portion of his time in it. The house which he 
occupied still stands ; and individuals still speak with delight of 
his unwearied benevolence, of his kindness and condescension to 
all who came within the sphere of his influence, particularly to 
those who he knew had been the objects of his father's regard. 
Professor Stewart was succeeded, as an heritor of the parish, by his 
son. Lieutenant- Colonel Matthew Stewart, a distinguished soldier 
and an accomplished scholar. On a very commanding situation 
on his property, and at a short distance from the house which was 
occupied by his father, he has built a new dwelling-house, and 
laid off the grounds about it with great taste.

There are no insane persons in the parish. There are two fa- 
tuous, and one deaf and dumb. The rapid increase of the popu- 
lation from 1775 to 1831, arose from the estabUshment of the cot- 
ton manufactory at Catrine, in 1792, by the late Claud Alexan- 
der, Esq. of Ballochmyle, and the late David Dale, Esq. ; and the 
decrease from 1831 to 1836 has arisen chiefly from the improve- 
ments which have taken place in machinery, by means of which, 
in some departments of that establishment, fewer persons are re- 
quired. In the country part of the parish, and in the village of Sorn, 
the population has varied httle since the date of the last Statistical 
Account in 1797. Then it was 1429, and at the end of 1836, 
1418, the difference being only 11 during that period. In the 
cotton manufactory, and in the bleachfield at Catrine, there are 
913 persons employed, of whom 315 ar males and 598 females. 
There are besides in the parish, 1 auctioneer ; 1 land-surveyor ; 
3 brewers; 7 bakers; 4 butchers; 1 carding-miller ; 15 carters 
and carriers; 6 cloth-merchafits ; 1 cooper; 3 clock and watch- 
makers; 1 corset-maker; 4 cowfeeders ; 1 dyer; 1 forester; 13 
grocers ; 9 grocers and spirit-dealers ; 5 gardeners ; 3 grain-mil- 
lers; 100 hand-sewers; 5 hawkers; 5 heddle-carders ; 7 inn-keep- 
ers; 2 keepers of lodgings ; 4 knitters of stockings ; 3 manufactur- 
ers' agents; 34 masons ; 37 pirn-fillers; 1 portrait-painter; 2 
painters; 4 painters of snuff-boxes; 1 plasterer; 9 snuff-box- 
makers ; 13 smiths ; 3 sewing-mistresses ; 53 shoemakers ; 6 saw- 
yers ; 3 surgeons and druggists ; 2 spirit-dealers ; 2 slaters ; 3 
students ; 4 straw-hat manufacturers ; 1 saddler ; 2 stocking- 
weavers; 2tambourers; 12 teachers; 4 tinsmiths ; 6 thatchers ; 
16 tailors; 120 hand-loom weavers ; 34 wrights; 5 white-seam- 
sewers. The remaining portion of the parish, with the exception 
of a few individuals who live upon their properties, consists of farm- 
ers, farm-servants, day-labourers, quarriers, and colliers. 

Character, Sfc. of the People. — The people of the parish are in 
general quiet, sober, and industrious. Most of them pay outward 
respect to religion, yet it is to be feared, as in other districts of the 



138 



AYRSHIRE. 



country, there is less of the power of religion among them than in 
times past. They are remarkable for their kindness towards each 
other, particularly in seasons of distress. Should an individual be 
laid on a bed of sickness, and be unable to procure for himself the 
essentials of existence, his neighbours are generally ready to share 
their humble meal with him — to attend him night after night, should 
their presence be required, and, when death has closed his eyes, they 
are always ready to render any assistance in their power to administer 
consolation to the afflicted family. Though living in a comparatively 
remote district of the country, where there is little facility of attaining 
to a knowledge of the higher branches of education, the people of the 
parish are by no means deficient in the spirit of enterprise, or in ge- 
neral and scientific knowledge. Several individuals, natives of the 
parish, at this moment, fill most honourably prominent situations in 
society, some in this and others in distant lands. A consider- 
able number of the villagers in Sorn and Catrine have a small 
piece of ground attached to their houses, on which they raise po- 
tatoes and a few common vegetables, for the use of their families, 
the working of which forms a pleasing recreation to them after the 
toils of the day. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish is supposed to contain about 19,000 
Scotch acres, of which about 7000 are in pasture after cultivation, 
about 3000 under crop or under rye-grass hay, about 600 in wood, 
about 3000 might, by a judicious application of capital, be brought 
into a state of cultivation, and the remainder is chiefly hill or moss. 

The value of the grain raised annually is about L. 7200 ; of 
rye-grass and meadow hay about L. 1716 ; of potatoes, beans, 
turnips, and carrots about L. 1517 ; of land in pasture, rating it at 
L. 3 per cow, and 6s. per sheep, L. 4320 ; dairy produce about 
L. 7000; of lime last year L. 600. The number of cows is about 
1264, of sheep 2161, of horses 221 . The valued rental is L. 541 1 
Scots, and the real rental about L. 7300. 

The rent of land on the higher ground varies from 12s. to 
L. 1, 2s. but on the holms, on the banks of the Ayr, and in the 
neighbourhood of the villages of Sorn and Catrine, it is as high as 
L. 3 per acre, or even more. 

The crops chiefly raised in the parish are oats, potatoes, and hay. 
There also a few acres of wheat and barley, beans, turnips, and 
occasionally a small quantity of carrots. The rotation is generally 
two crops of oats, one of hay, and five years of pasture. In seve- 
ral instances a more improved system of farming has been recently 



SORN. 



139 



introduced, and that chiefly by those who have had recourse to 
furrow-draining. When this mode of draining was first introduced 
into Ayrshire, it was done by means of small stones ; of late, how- 
ever, tiles have been substituted for stones, and are now to be 
easily obtained in this and in most of the neighbouring parishes. 
The impulse which this species of improvement has given to agri- 
culture, and the increase of produce, is very great. This is strik- 
ingly, exemphfied in the glebe, which has been drained by the pre- 
sent incumbent. Fields which yielded only from 3| to 4 bolls of 
oats per acre when he entered upon his charge, yield now about 
7 or 8 bolls per acre. But perhaps one of the most remarkable 
examples of the good effects of furrow- draining is to be found on 
a piece of moss in the parish belonging to Archibald Buchanan, 
Esq. of Catrine Bank, who was, if not the first, at least amongst 
the first, who introduced this mode of draining into Ayrshire. 
This piece of moss, consisting of about 20 acres, averaging 14 
feet deep, till within these few years, was lying in a worse than 
useless state, and the damp arising from it frequently mildewed 
the crops in the neighbouring fields. After being drained and 
dug, about 40 bolls of lime, and 50 carts of compost, consisting 
of two-thirds clay, and one-third dung, were spread upon every acre. 
After this it was sown with oats, and the crop averaged about 6 
and 7 bolls per acre. It has since been in sheep pasture, and 
yields a return of about L. 2 per acre yearly. Three acres of this 
moss have been green cropped, and yielded about 30 tons of 
turnips per acre. The whole cost of cutting the drains, digging, 
lime, compost, and putting in the first crop, amounted to L. 14 
per acre, and by these means, from being worse than useless, the 
moss has become equally as valuable, if not more valuable than 
any arable land on the property on which it lies. Should this 
system of furrow-draining be carried to its greatest possible extent, 
it is to be hoped, that our country will not only in general be in- 
dependent of supplies of foreign grain, but become an exporting 



one. 



JVaffes. — The usual rate of wages given to a ploughman is from 
L. 7 to L. 8 half-yearly ; to a dairy maid from L. 4 to L. 5 ; to 
married male servants who live in houses of their own from L. 10 
to L. 12. Day-labourers receive about Is. 8d. per day ; females, 
when engaged in out-door work, about lOd. ; masons and wrights 
about 2s. 6d. per day ; when hired for the harvest work of a sea- 
son, men receive about L.3, women about L. 2. Wages of weavers 



140 



AYllSHIRE. 



in this, as in other jDarishes, fluctuate very much. Sometimes a 
good weaver may earn from Is. 6d. to 2s. per day; at other times 
only from 9d. to Is. 

Stock. — The cows in the parish are mostly of the Cunningham 
breed, and the sheep are the common black-faced. No particu- 
lar attention is paid to the breed of horses in the parish, which is to 
be regretted. For were farmers careful to have something of the 
blood horse in their horses, they would find them much better fit- 
ted for every species of work, and better able to undergo fatigue 
than those now generally in use among them. 

Manufactures. — In the village of Catrine, and on a part of 
the estate of Ballochmyle, which still forms a part of the parish 
of Sorn, there are the very extensive cotton and bleaching-works 
belonging to Messrs James Finlay and Company of Glasgow. 
These works were commenced in 1786, by the late Claud Alex- 
ander, Esq. of Ballochmyle, and the late David Dale, Esq. mer- 
chant in Glasgow. At that time, where the village of Catrine 
stands, there w-ere only two families living, — those of the miller and 
blacksmith ; now it contains a population of 2702 souls, whose 
chief support is derived from the cotton and bleaching works. In 
1801, the cotton works were purchased from Claud Alexander, Esq. 
and David Dale, Esq. by their present proprietors, and have since 
been greatly enlarged and improved, particularly by the erection 
of an extensive bleaching work in 1824, and three very large water- 
wheels a few years ago. Two of these wheels, which are about 50 
feet diameter, and estimated at 100 horse power each, along with 
two steam engines of about 40 horse power each, which are 
used occasionally in dry seasons to make up for any deficiency in 
the supply of water, and to insure regularity of motion, propel the 
machinery in the cotton manufactory ; and the third, which is about 
32 feet diameter, aided by a steam-engine of twenty-five horse 
power, when there is a scarcity of water, propels the machinery in 
the bleaching establishment. At Catrine, the cotton which is 
brought from Glasgow is spun, woven, bleached, finished, and put 
up for home sale and exportation, to suit the various markets. The 
weight of yarn spun in 1836 was 951,973 lbs., and the quantity 
of goods produced 1 72, 175 pieces of 25 yards, or 4,304,393 yards, 
equal to 2445 miles. Besides bleaching that which is manufac- 
tured at Catrine, there is also bleached at the bleachfield there 
the cotton cloth manufactured at the other works belonging to 
Messrs James Finlay and Company. The quantity of cloth bleach- 



SORN.

ed varies from 15 to 25,000 yards per day. The superior quality of 
the goods manufactured by the Catrine Company, and the manner 
in which they are bleached and finished, have obtained for them 
such a decided preference, both in the home and foreign markets, 
that individuals have in some instances assumed the mark of the 
Catrine Company, with the view of getting their goods more rea- 
dily disposed of. The bleaching process is completed within doors, 
and is carried on without interruption at all seasons of the year, 
and that, too, without the slightest injury being done to the cloth ; 
nay, with the advantages of superior purity and colour, and a vast 
saving of time in the process, as well as of land, which, when the 
old system of bleaching was adopted, was required to expose the 
cloth to the action of the sun's rays. In the Catrine bleaching- 
work there is a saving of from 150 to 200 acres of land. In the 
different departments of spinning, weaving, and bleaching, and in 
the making and repairing of machinery connected with the cotton 
and bleaching-works, there are 913 persons employed, besides 
masons, labourers, and others, who on an average may amount to 
30 more ; and the whole money put in circulation, and paid at the 
Catrine works in 1836, amounted to L. 27,568, 18s. The wages 
are paid every Friday ; and every thing is done to promote the 
moral and religious interests, as well as the comfort of the people 
connected with the works. Before the new regulations with re- 
gard to the education of the young persons employed in cotton- 
factories were introduced, the Catrine Company, at their own ex- 
pense, provided a schoolmaster, to whom all who were connected with 
the works had, and still have, access immediately after the labours 
of the day are over, without any charge whatever. From 200 to 
300 individuals have been in the habit of availing themselves of 
this privilege, thereby laying the foundation of future happiness 
and future usefulness to themselves and to others. When a stag- 
nation in trade occurs, and other works of a similar description 
suspend their operations wholly, or in part, the Catrine Company 
carry on their operations without intermission, and keep their 
workers in full employment. A goodly feeling has in consequence, 
with but little interruption, subsisted between the employed and their 
employers in the Catrine works. An attempt, it is true, was made 
about two years ago to destroy this goodly feeling by the formation 
of a union among the workers, and by a demand for an increase 
of wages. This attempt, as generally happens in such cases, fail- 
ed, — much distress ensued, and the greater number of those who 



142 



AYRSHIRE. 



had been seduced from an establishment, where they had uni- 
formly been treated with all the kindness and consideration con- 
sistent with its proper management, returned after the lapse of a 
few months, and solicited admission to their former situations. Ex- 
cept in the cases of those who took a leading part in this union, 
the applications of all were listened to, and the same harmony and 
good feeling which formerly prevailed in this establishment seem 
again to prevail, and, it is hoped, will long continue. The works 
at Catrine, as well as the workers, have uniformly excited the ad- 
miration of strangers ; and from the books of the General Friendly 
Society at Catrine, with which many of the persons employed at 
the Catrine works are connected, it is evident there is less sick- 
ness among the people employed at the works than among any 
other description of workmen in the village. The success of this 
establishment, and the comfortable circumstances of the indivi- 
duals employed at it, are mainly owing to the able and judicious 
management of Archibald Buchanan, Esq. the resident partner of 
Messrs James Finlay and Company, who has managed the works 
at Catrine almost from the time they passed into the hands of the 
present proprietors. Besides the weaving of cotton cloth by power- 
looms at Catrine works, there is in this, as in most of the parishes 
of Ayrshire where there is a village population, a number of hand- 
loom weavers. The employment afforded to this class of workmen is 
very precarious, and the remuneration when trade is at its best so 
very small, that whenever an opportunity occurs many individuals 
who follow this profession abandon it. In 1826 the number of 
hand-loom weavers in the parish was about 220, now it is only 
about 120. 

There is a grain-mill in the parish, which has attached to it a 
saw-mill, where, at a reasonable rate, a great quantity of wood is 
sawn. There is also a carding-mill, a brewery, and two licensed 
private brewers in the parish. Several of the farmers have thrash- 
ing-mills attached to their farm-yards, which are chiefly driven by 

Viorses. . 

Quarries.— There are at present three hme-quarries wrought m 
the parish ;— one on the estate of Sorn Castle, a second on the 
estate of Dalgain, and a third on the estate of Gilmillscroft. That 
on Sorn Castle has only been opened up this year, although it was 
formerly wrought a considerable time ago. Indeed, there is a well 
authenticated tradition, that the lime with which the old bridge at 
Ayr was built was taken from that quarry. The quarries on Dal-

gain and Gilmillscroft have been wrought for a number of years. 
Last year their joint produce amounted to 9000 bolls. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toions. — There are no market-towns in the parish ; but 
in the villages of Catrine and Sorn, there are a number of excel- 
lent shops, at which almost every article required for domestic use 
can be purchased as good, and on as easy terms as in large towns. 
Besides the regular supply of butcher-meat and vegetables which 
maybe obtained daily from the butchers and grocers in the villages, 
there is an excellent market for butcher-meat and vegetables held 
every Saturday at Catrine village. 

Villages— T\\exe are two villages in the parish, — Catrine and 
Sorn. The former contains 2700 souls, and the latter about 300. 
In Catrine, people are chiefly dependent for employment on 
the cotton and bleaching-works there, and in Sorn, with the ex- 
ception of about eight-hand loom weavers, they are chiefly agri- 
cultural labourers, colliers, quarriers, and hand-sewers. 

Inns.— There are four inns in the village of Catrine, two in the 
village of Sorn, and one at Greenfoot, about a quarter of a mile 
from the village of Sorn, on the road from Galston to Auchin- 
leck. 

Means of Communication. — About six miles of the road from 
Ayr to Muirkirk, and about five miles of the road from Galston 
to Auchinleck, pass through the parish. There are penny-post 
offices in Catrine and Sorn, and the mail gig with the mail from 
Ayr and Kilmarnock for London, passes through the latter village 
every morning about seven o'clock on its way to Douglas Mill, where 
it meets the mail-coach from Glasgow to London, and waits the ar- 
rival of the mail from London to Glasgow. On receiving the letter- 
bags for Ayr, Kilmarnock, Cumnock, and Mauchhne, it returns 
again immediately, 8,nd passes through Sorn about three o'clock p. M., 
bringing letters and papers from London in about forty-four hours. 
The coach from Glasgow to Dumfries passes through Mauchline, 
about four miles distant from Sorn, every lawful day, about thtee 
o'clock. There are carriers twice a week from Sorn and Catrine 
to and from Glasgow, leaving those places every Monday and 
Thursday, and returning again every Wednesday and Saturday. 
There is also a carrier from Catrine to Ayr every Tuesday and 
Friday, and from the Same place to Kilmarnock on Tuesdays and 
Fridays. The Catrine Company despatch carts with goods to Glas- 
gow every lawful evening, which, by means of a relay of horses on the 



144 



AYRSHIRE. 



the road, reach their destination early on the following forenoon. 
Carts are also despatched from Glasgow every evening with cotton 
and goods for the bleachfield, which reach Catrine every forenoon. 
There is a stone bridge over the Ayr, near the manse on the 
road from Galston to Auchinleck, which was- begun and com- 
pleted through the exertions of the Rev. William Steele, the se- 
cond minister who was settled in the parish after its final sepa- 
ration from Mauchline. There is also an excellent stone bridge 
over the Ayr at Catrine, on the road from Mauchline to Muir- 
kirk through that village. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish of Sorn was originally a part 
of the parish of Mauchline, from which it was finally and complete- 
ly separated in 1692, when Mr Mungo Lindsay was ordained mi- 
nister, a stipend and glebe provided, and a manse built. The pre- 
cise year in which the church was built cannot be ascertained. The 
writer of the last Statistical Account represents it to have been 
built in 1656; but there is a stone in a part of the building which 
represents it to have been built in 1658. From Wodrow's history, 
it appears that a Mr John Campbell was ejected from Dalgain in 
1662 for non-comphance with Episcopacy; and according to 
Cruickshanks, Mr Andrew Dalrymple, minister at Auchinleck, was 
« indulged" to Sorn in 1669. Nor is it improbable that, previous to 
the Revolution in 1688, there was an Episcopal incumbent settled m 
the parish, as a tradition prevails that he was obliged to flee at that 
period ; and a small pass at the side of the river Ayr, near Sorn 
Castle, over which he is said to have passed during his flight, is 
still called the Curate's Steps. It is not unlikely that he vs-as one 
of those to whom Bishop Burnet alludes as being so obnoxious to 
the people, that they tore their gowns, and carried these in mock 
procession through their parishes previous to expelling them. In 
1826 the church was thoroughly repaired, and the seating so ar- 
ranged as to accommodate about 50 persons more than formerly. 
It is conveniently enough situated for the parish,— has 61 1 sittings, 
of which 64 are set apart for the poor and those not otherwise en- 
titled to church accommodation. There is besides a chapel of 
ease in the village of Catrine, which was built by the late Claud 
Alexander, Esq. of Ballochmyle, in 1792, and cost L. 1000. In 
1829, this chapel was purchased from the present Claud Alexander, 
Esq. of Ballochmyle, by the feuars of Catrine, who, by their feu- 
riahts, are bound to maintain a chapel in connection with the 
Establishment, as well as a church-yard. This chapel, which con- 



SORN. 



145 



tains about 730 sittings, will, it is expected, in a short time be con- 
stituted a parish church, and the village of Catrine be assigned to 
its minister as a parish quoad sacra. 

The present manse was built by the Rev. William Steele, to 
whom allusion has already been made, soon after he was settled 
minister of the parish, and that chiefly at his own expense,— the he- 
ritors having only granted him a small allowance for the purpose. 
Some additions have been made to it by succeeding incumbents, 
and, if thoroughly repaired, it might prove a comfortable manse for 
sometime to come. The glebe, including the ground on which 
the manse and office-houses stand, is about 9 Scotch acres. The 
stipend is 123 bolls of meal, 52 bolls of bear, of the old weight 
and measure of the county, and L. 37, 6s. 9d. 

A meeting-house in connection with the United Secession 
Church has recently been built at Catrine, but as yet no minister 
has been appointed to it. This meeting-house has been erected, 
not in consequence of any recent accession in the parish to the re- 
ligious denomination with which it is connected, but chiefly, it is 
supposed, for the accommodation of those persons belonging to that 
body who have been in the habit of attending the meeting-houses 
at Mauchline and Cumnock. 

The number of persons in the parish belonging to the Esta- 
blishment is 3360, of whom 1299 are communicants. 760 belong 
to other denominations, chiefly to the United Secession. 

Education.— T\veve is one parochial school in the parish, with 
the legal accommodation and the maximum salary, situated close by 
the church, within about a quarter of a mile of the village of Sorn. 
There are, besides, in the rural district four teachers, and in the 
village of Catrine seven teachers, all of whom, with one exception, 
depend entirely on the school wages, which average about 3d. per 
week. The exception is the teacher employed by the Catrine Cot- 
ton Company, who receives from them L. 50 a«-year for teaching 
in the evening, the more advanced young persons engaged in their 
works, and about L. 30 annually for instructing during the day 
those who are under thirteen years of age, in terms of the factories' 
regulation bill. The number of the persons in the parish attend- 
ing school is about 500. 

Libraries. — There are four libraries in the village of Catrine : 
one, called the Public Library, was instituted in 1814, consists 
of upwards of 600 volumes, and has 70 members, who pay L. 1 of 
entry money, and 2s. 3d. annually. The second is the New Pub-. 
Ayr. k 



146 



AYRSHIRE. 



lie Library, instituted in 1829, consists of upwards of 700 volunnes, 
and has about 100 members, who pay Is. of entry money, and 
4s. 4d. annually. The third is the Philosophical Library, which 
was instituted in 1825, consists of about 90 volumes, and has 24 
members, who pay Is. of entry money, and 2s. annually. And the 
fourth is a library in connection with the Catrine works Sabbath 
school, consisting of 528 volumes, to which all the young persons 
attending the Sabbath school have access gratis. 

Friendly Societies. — The only friendly society at present in the 
parish is in the village of Catrine. It was instituted in 1829, and 
remodelled in 1832. There are 320 members, whose average 
annual assessment is about lis. 6d. The funds at present are 
L. 254, and L. 170 were paid last year to members claiming re- 
lief. Another Friendly Society was instituted in 1794, but was 
lately dissolved. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the roll 
at the end of 1836 was 38, and the average allowance to each 
weekly was Is. 2id. The average number for the last seven years 
was 32, and the average allowance to each weekly during that ]e- 
riod was Is. ld. and a cart of coals annually. There are besides 
individuals who have received occasional relief. In 1836, the num- 
ber of persons who received occasional relief was 30, and the 
average sum granted to each was 1 Is. 5M. For the last seven years 
the average number of persons receiving occasional relief yearly 
was 36, and the average sum allotted to each during that period 
was lis. 3id. The reUef thus granted is but small, yet, with the 
aid of friends and the kindness of neighbours, the greater propor- 
tion of these poor persons have generally been supported in some 
deo-ree of comfort. The whole amount expended on the poor of 
the parish, in 1836, was L. 135, Os. Hd., and the average amount 
for the last seven years was L. 113, Os. 3|d. annually. This sum 
is raised from thecoUections at the parish church and the chapel 
at Catrine, the interest of L. 110, the result chiefly of some dona- 
tions, mortcloth-money, small sums received at marriages, and a 
voluntary assessment on the part of the heritors. The manage- 
ment of "the poor's funds is entirely in the hands of the kn-k-ses- 
sion, who exhibit a statement of the money received and expend- 
ed by them annually to the heritors. 

Fairs —There are two fairs held at Sorn annually,— one on the 
second Tuesday of March, O. S., and the other on the first Mon- 
day of November, N. S. At the former, there is a great attend- 



MUIRKIRK. 



147 



ance of people from the surrounding district. A good deal of busi- 
ness is transacted, and a number of cattle disposed of. There is 
also a race run on this occasion, which tends to increase the con- 
course of persons. At the latter, which has only been recently in- 
stituted, the attendance is but small. 

FueL — The fuel used in the parish is peat and coal ; peat in the 
higher districts, and coal in the villages and places adjacent. Till 
of late, coal was found in considerable quantities in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the village of Sorn, and the price was in conse- 
quence very moderate, 3s. per cart of 12 cwt. laid down at the 
doors of the villagers. At present the coal used in the parish is 
brought from the parish of Auchinleck, a distance of about four 
miles, and with the rise of price which has taken place in that ar- 
ticle during the present year, and the additional cost of cartage, a 
cart of 12 cwt. of coals, laid down in the village of Sorn, costs 
5s. 3d. An attempt, however, is now making on an extensive scale 
to raise coal in the parish, and should it be successful, of which 
there seems a probability, this district will, as in times past, be 
abundantly supplied ith coals, and the dwellings of the poor and 
labouring classes be again cheered by that great alleviation of the 
ills of poverty, — a comfortable fire.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JAMES SYMINGTON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Muirkirk is the most easterly parish of the county of 
Ayr, and was known in former times, by the title of "the Muirkirk 
of Kyle." Until about the year 1626, it constituted a part of 
the parish of Mauchline, and was subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Earls of Loudon. A separate provision was at that time made for a 
minister, and a building erected for public worship. 

Extent, Sfc. — The parish is about 8 miles in length from east 

 Drawn up by the late incumbent, tlie Rev. Alexander Brown. 



148 



AYRSHIRE. 



to west, and 7 miles broad from north to south. Its area must 
therefore contain 56 square miles, or above 30,000 acres. It is 
bounded on the east and south east, by the parishes of Douglas 
and Crawfordjohn; on the north and north-east, by the parishes of 
Avondale and Lesmahagow ; on the south and south-west, by 
Auchinleck ; and on the west and north-west, by Sorn and Gal- 
ston. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its surface is uneven, often rising 
into considerable eminences, covered with dark heath, and presents 
nothing either grand or striking to the beholder. The highest 
hill in the parish, or indeed in the county, is called Cairntable. 
It has two cairns or heaps of stones upon its top, and is 1650 feet 
above the level of the sea'. Breccia or pudding-rock enters largely 
into its composition, which is here formed of small pieces of quartz 
minutely mixed with sandstone, and nearly as hard as granite. It 
supplied for many years the millstones used in the parish for grinding 
oats, and I make no doubt it would still be found admirably adapted 
for this purpose. Tradition also asserts that it was a place of worship. 
The level land is mostly to be found near the banks of the rivers 
— the adjoining land rising sometimes into gentle eminences, 
and at other times swelling abruptly into hills. These again run- 
ning into each other, and, gradually ascending, form the boundary 
of the parish nearly in all directions, and at a medium altitude of 
about 1000 feet. 

The prevailing winds are from the east and south. During 
a thunder storm about four years ago, a water-spout fell on the 
farm of High Priesthill, possessed by Mr Weir, near the nor- 
thern extremity of the parish, which washed away about thirty 
acres of land, and otherwise did considerable damage. From the 
altitude of the parish, and from the great extent of moss earth 
constituting its surface, fogs are frequent and rain abundant. The 
torpid moss earth engenders cold, and the great quantity of mois- 
ture retained upon its surface is a fruitful source of vapour, render- 
ing the air humid and disagreeable. The evaporation, however, 
from moss seems not to prove injurious to the constitution. The 
plants which go to the formation of this earth do not, as on lands 
covered with rich herbage, putrify and render the air unwholesome. 
Being possessed of an antiseptic quality, they remain long in their 
original form and consistency. Hence the copious exhalations, 
drawn from a source so cold and damp, may indeed benumb vege-

tation, but do not aftect the health of the inhabitants. There 
are, therefore, no particular diseases incident to the parish which 
are the result of moist air ; nor any other diseases that are not 
common to other parts of the country. 

Hydrography. — There are many excellent springs in this parish, 
but none of them present any thing peculiarly interesting, if we ex- 
cept a few which possess the power of petrifaction. These springs 
are not strong, but the process can be distinctly seen. The moss 
which grows on the edge of each of the springs is generally about 
two inches high. The moss is green and flourishing on the top, the 
middle appears as if half-frozen, and the lower part is converted 
into stone. I am not aware that any springs have been found pos- 
sessing medicinal qualities, but it is not unlikely that there may be 
a few unknown impregnated with sulphur, iron, or other mineral in- 
fusion. 

There are no natural lakes, but two artificial lochs or reservoirs 
were formed about the year 1802, at Glenbuck, in this parish, by 
Messrs James Finlay and Company, of Glasgow, to supply their 
cotton works at Catrine. They cover 121 acres of land. 

The water of Ayr, which is the second river in point of mag- 
nitude in the county, rises immediately out of the reservoirs al- 
ready mentioned  and, after running a distance of thirty miles, falls 
into the Frith of Clyde at Ayr. It is augmented by a number of 
lesser streams before leaving the parish, amongst which may be 
mentioned the waters of Garpel, Greenock, and Whitehaugh. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There is an extensive field of coal 
and other minerals, forming a portion of the great coal-field of 
Scotland, which runs from east to west about seven miles, and is, on 
an average, about one mile and a-half broad. The thickness of the 
coal at present wrought is 24 feet 4 inches ; but, altogether, there 
will be nearly 40 feet of workable coal. There are also twenty-four 
bands of ironstone, of the average thickness of 6 inches. The line 
of dip is irregular. ' In the northern portion of the coal field, it is 
greater than in the southern, varying from one foot in two, to one 
foot in seven, and, in some portions of the outcrop, it is nearly 
vertical ; while in the southern portion it seldom varies more than 
from one foot in two and a half to one foot in three and a half, 
and some portions are lying nearly flat. There is an immense 
number of slips or fallings, which are found to lead about 30° south- 
east and north-west. They are found straight or in an oblique 



150 



AYRSHIRE. 



direction, according as the substance is hard or soft, through which 
they pass, and vary in wideness from a quarter of an inch to four 
or five feet. When these slips are wide, the coal on each side of 
them is generally bad, the strata bent in the direction of the slip, 
and the coal beds much thinner. There are tlrree stages or dikes 
found in this coal-field, varying in thickness from 2 inches to 122 
feet, composed of greenstone, porphyritic claystone, and calcareous 
spar. The coal is always bad near these stages. Its natural fissures 
are filled with sulphate of lime, or iron pyrites, which increase as they 
approach the stage, until the coal becomes a mass of black sooty 
matter, called by the miners dander coal, resembling charcoal m 
its colour and specific gravity. The thickness of the stage de- 
termines in general the extent of this coal, as it is to be found 
lying on each side of it in the proportion of one-half of its thick- 
ness, and is always arranged in columns resting upon the stage. 
The coal in this parish is the independent formation of Werner, 
and the rocks to be found are generally those which are connected, 
and have a strong affinity with it, viz. conglomerate, sandstone, 
limestone, slate-clay, porphyritic claystone, bituminous shale, clay, 
ironstone, greenstone, &amp;c. Vegetable remains are to be found 
in only two of the seams of coal, in the roof of one and mixed 
through the other. Shells perfectly white are to be found in the 
ironstone clay, and numerous vegetable impressions in the iron- 
stone. The most perfect, however, are to be found in the lime- 
stone and indurated clay connected with it. The smaller impres- 
sions appear to be of such plants as flourish in marshes and woods, 
and the leaves and stems of the larger resemble those of palms 
and ferns. 

Ores.— Iron ore, lead, and manganese have been found, and the 
two former wrought, but the experiment was given up, the veins 
being found poor and unproductive. 

Soils.— Sand, clay, gravel, loam, and moss are the principal allu- 
vial deposits. They are to be found of various thicknesses. The 
moss in particular varies from one to twenty feet. Entire hazel- 
nuts have been found in the latter, and large trees of oak, fir, and 
birch are abundant. Moss is the principal soil, covering at least 
two-third parts of the surface of the parish, and to be found in 
three different species, as flow-moss, bent-moss, and h.l -moss. 
The principal plants, according to Mr Aiton, which go to the for- 
mation, and which are to be found on these different mosses, are,-

Mines. — There are nuinerous mines of coal, iron.stone, and lime, 
all wrought upon the most approved plans. The principal seam 
of coal being thick, and the rise moderate, rail-roads are laid, and 
horses employed to drag the coal and ironstone from the rooms 
and other workings to the bottom of the shaft. As in other parts 
of Scotland, a part only of the stratum is excavated in the first 
working of the pit the other part being left as pillars to support 
the roof. The miners are much troubled with choke damp or 
carbonic acid gas ; but never with inflammable damp or carburet- 
ted hydrogen gas. 

Natural vwods. — It appears from a charter granted to the monks 
of Melrose by the Grand Stewart of Scotland, that this and the 
neighbouring parish of Sorn were a forest in the end of the twelfth 
century. That it was, at one time, covered with trees is abundant- 
ly evident, from the names of many of the farms, from the trees 
found in mosses, and from small clumps and detached trees of 
birch and mountain-ash still to be seen on braes, and by the sides 
of narrow ravines. To whatever cause the destruction of these 
trees may be attributed, it is much to be regretted. In a hilly 
country such as this, the want of shelter is severely felt ; and the 
prostrate trunks and branches, by obstructing water and assisting 
in the formation of moss earth, must have proved highly injurious 
to the climate. The Honourable Keith Stewart, "who became 
proprietor by purchase about forty years ago, of the greater por- 
tion of the land in this parish, judiciously planted numerous belts 
near the water of Ayr. They are composed mostly of larch, 
spruce, and fir ; but whether from carelessness, bad management, 
or the trees not suiting the soil, some of them have made but lit-

tie progress. Other proprietors have since followed his example. 
The land planted is no doubt small in proportion to the extent of 
the parish, but it has contributed much to the comfort and beauty 
of the place. 

II. — Civil History. 
The ancient history of this parish is hid in impenetrable ob- 
scurity. There are many single stones still standing, which, in all 
likelihood, were erected to commemorate events at the time con- 
sidered sufficiently important, the knowledge of which is now com- 
pletely gone. Tradition, ever busy, endeavours to account in 
many different ways for their erection ; but tradition will be found 
too often associated with fable to be trusted. There are no writ- 
ten memorials — no distinguishing mark or hieroglyphic to be found 
on the stones themselves, which could lead us positively to affirm 
that they were erected to perpetuate either the memory of some 
petty skirmish or fallen chief ; and with the exception of one on 
the farm of Laighshaw, possessed by Mr Murray, which is about 
eight feet high, they are too small and unimportant to be asso- 
ciated with any former religion. There are, however, other monu- 
ments of a later and most unhappy period of Scottish history, which 
tell but too unequivocally of the sufferings and death of our brave 
progenitors. The most remarkable of these monuments is the 
gravestone of one John Brown, erected on the farm of Priesthill. 
The death of this man was perpetrated with such cold-blooded 
cruelty, near • his own habitation, and in presence of his wife and 
family, that to visit his grave is considered a sort of pilgrimage 
by the pious of all persuasions. The stone bears that he was shot 
through the head by a party commanded by Graham of Claver- 
house, while upon his knees, and in the act of prayer. It is said 
that Claverhouse, or one of his party, lifted up his dead body, and 
carried it to his wife, asking her, « what she thought of her hus- 
band " " Mair," said she, " than ever I did, but the Lord will 
avenge this another day."  A new monument has lately been 
erected on the site of the old one, suitable to the taste and libe- 
rality of the present times. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, His Grace the 
Duke of Portland ; the Right Honourable the Earl of Douglas ; 
the Right Honourable the Earl of Hyndford ; the Honourable 
Colonel M' Adam Cathcart of Craigengillan ; Mr Blackwood of

Parish Begisters.-Bdoxe the year 1772 the parish registers 
are very imperfect and irregular ; but since that period they have 
been regularly kept. The first entry is dated in the year 1739. 

III. — Population. 
The population previously to the erection of the iron works, to 
be mentioned afterwards, must have been small,— the parish being 
a pastoral district, and the farms large. The present increase is 
no doubt owing to the establishment of these works ; but the po- 
pulation is constantly fluctuating,— the iron company increasing 
or diminishing the number of workmen as the trade will allow.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — As the whole land in the parish has not been 
measured,— as it is for the greater part lying uninclosed, and 
the sheep husbandry occupying the principal care and attention of 
the farmers, little land in comparison is cultivated, and that, little 
as it is, cannot be exactly stated in statute acres. But the pro- 
bable quantity of land under tillage annually may amount to about 
1000 acres, and the number of acres which never have been culti- 
vated may be stated at about 25,000.  The number of acres 
that might with a profitable application of capital be added to the 
cultivated land of the parish is very considerable ; and, with a few 

 These numbers appear inconsistent with the real amount of acres in the parish, 
which is 30,000. The 4000 acres not mentioned above have been in crop, although 
not in tillage annually, and cannot, therefore, be added to the land that has never 
been cultivated. , 



154 



AYRSHIRE. 



exceptions, the whole surface might be brought to yield a far great- 
er abundance of permanent pasture. 

Plantations. — The plantations on the property of His Grace the 
Duke of Portland cover nearly 200 acres of land, and I should 
suppose that '20 acres more will be found round the seats of resi- 
dent proprietors. The trees generally planted are larch, spruce, 
and fir, and, though much neglected formerly, his Grace has, since 
acquiring the property, paid considerable attention to thinning. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1 per 
acre. A cow's grass is L. 3, and a full-grown sheep 3s. 6d. 

Live-Stock. — The most approved breed of sheep is the black- 
faced kind. Considerable care is always taken to select the 
strongest and best shaped ewe lambs to continue the stock ; and 
occasionally a few tups of the same kind are purchased, but of 
larger size and finer shapes,, by better feeding and more skilful 
crossing. The attention of the farmer is fully awakened to the 
practicability of still further improvements; and I make no doubt, 
that, in a very few years, by a continuation of their care, this hardy 
and useful animal will become much more productive. 

There are numerous dairies of the best Cunninghame breed of 
cows. A number of young cattle of the same kind are reared an- 
nually, and care is always taken to retain the most handsome to 
improve the stock. A few young horses are also reared. 

The old system of taking two, and sometimes three, crops of 
oats without manure, and allowing the land to rest for a few vears 
to recover its lost energies, is still followed by a few of the farmers 
in this parish. By far the greater number, howevei', are farming, 
what land has been converted into arable, after the most approved 
systems of husbandry. Green cropping has of late years greatly 
increased, and, in all likelihood, will increase, and a portion of 
waste land has been retained : but there are many thousand of 
acres still lying in their natural state. Surface-draining alone 
would improve the grasses on this soil, ameliorate the climate, and 
enhance the value of stock. Lime and coal gre abundant and 
cheap. In short, every requisite is at hand were it but applied. 
The spirit of improvement is, however, awakened. The Duke of 
Portland, with his usual public spirit and wisdom, is opening roads 
through his property, and building lime kilns. Other proprietors 
deserve to be mentioned, and in particular Mr Aird ; who has im- 
proved a great extent of moss land. There are many tenants also 



MUIRKIRK. 



155 



who have, at their own expense, improved their farms by surface- 
draining, Hming, and ploughing. 

The leases run from seven to fifteen years. 

Farm-Buildings. — The farm houses are comfortable, many of 
them having been lately erected, but the out-houses are in gene- 
ral miserable. The stables and byres are small and unsuitable, — 
little or no convenience for dairy husbandry, and, taken as a whole, 
inconsistent with the extent of the farms, and the improvements of 
the present times. There are few fences, composed mostly of 
stone, and in many instances ill constructed, and in a ruinous con- 
dition. 

Produce. — It is impossible to give a correct account of the value 
of the raw produce, but it may be nearly as follows : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether cultivated for the food of man or the 

domestic animals, - - - L. 2700 

Ofpotatoes and other plants cultivated in the fields, - - 2U00 

Of hay, meadow and cultivated, ... 350 
Of land in pasture, rating it at L. 3, per cow grazed for the season, and at 

3s. 6d. per ewe, or full-grown sheep pastured for the year, - 3450 

Of the annual thinning and periodical felling of wood, - - 20 

Of mines, whether coals, quarries, or metals, — say, - - 10,000 

Total amount of raw produce, as far as can be stated,' - L. 18,520 

Manufactures. — The only manufactory in the parish is that of iron. 
Very extensive iron works were erected in 1787. These works con- 
sist of three large blast furnaces for making pig-iron, an extensive 
forge for making bar-iron, with a foundery and inferior works. Two 
of the blast furnaces only have been going for a number of years, and 
these employ about 400 workmen, who work six days in the week, 
and eight hours per day. The materials used in making iron are 
ironstone, coal, and lime, and it takes "2 tons 12cwt. of ironstone, 
8 tons 12 cwt. of coals ; and 19 cwt. and 3 quarters of lime, to make 
one ton of pig iron. Founders esteem it soft, easily melted, and 
of the best quality. The bar iron is also very superior, being lit- 
tle if at all inferior to the best Swedish iron. This proceeds partly 
from the coals used in manufacturing it being nearly free of sul- 
phur, and partly Jrom the manner of beating out the bars, instead 
of drawing them out by rollers as in other iron works. 

The coal field and other minerals under lease by the present 
Company are extensive, and we may look forward to this manufac- 
tory supplying for many years the means of wealth to all parties 
concerned, and promoting, as it has hitherto done, the agricultural 
interests of the parish.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toiuns— Means of Communication.— There are two vil- 
lages in the parish, Muirkirk and Glenbuclc. The latter village 
was an appendage to the iron-works erected at that place, and car- 
ried on for some time by an English company. These works were 
given up many years ago, and the village has since fallen into de- 
cay. Muirkirk IS a thriving village, and is also indebted for its pre- 
sent extent to the iron-works already mentioned, erected in its 
neighbourhood. The nearest market-town is Strathaven, situated 
at a aistance of thirteen miles, to which there is an excellent road. 
The road from Edinburgh by Douglas-mill to Ayr passes through 
It ; and there is a good road to Mauchline, which is distant fourteen 
miles. Some of the parish roads have been lately repaired out of 
the stalute-labour collected from the inhabitants, and it is expect- 
ed that the remaining roads will be made and repaired ere long out 
of the same fund. There is a post-office. There are several 
bridges in the parish, particularly on the line of the Edinburgh 
road, in tolerable repair. The canals and rail-roads are connect- 
ed with the iron-works, and Umited in their extent. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church is situated near the 
centre of the parish, and is as convenient as it possibly can be for 
the greater part of the inhabitants. It will be between four and five 
miles from the extremities. It was built about twenty years ago, and 
has lately undergone a thorough repair, and is capable of accommo- 
dating 1000 sitters. The manse has been repaired within the last 
four years, and is at present comfortable. The glebe extends to 
about 14 acres, has been greatly improved, and is now capable 
of raising almost any crop. The stipend amounts to L. 150 per 
annum. 

There is only one meeting-house in the parish, belonging to the 
Burgher persuasion. It has been only occasionally preached in for 
the last three years. The number of families attending the Esta- 
blished Church is 380, and the number attending the meeting- 
house 45. Divine service is well attended, and the number of com- 
municants 400, 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish. The parish 
schoolmaster receives a sAlary of L. 28 per annum, with free house 
and garden. About 70 scholars attend. Altogether his emolu- 
ments, exclusive of house and garden, may amount to L. 80. The 
branches taught are Greek, Latin, English, writing, arithmetic, and 



MUlRKillK. 



157 



book-keeping. The other schoolmasters teach English, writing, 
arithmetic, and book-keeping, and are supported by the scholars. 

Libraries. — There are two circulating libraries supported by 
subscription. The members are numerous, and the collection of 
books large and well selected. ' 

Friendly Societies. — There are three friendly societies ; the 
Muirkirk Friendly Society commenced on the 3d of July 1790 ; the 
St Thomas Mason Lodge Friendly Society has existed about thirty 
years, and the St Andrew's Mason Lodge Friendly Society about 
twenty years. All these societies have been productive of much 
good, by promoting industry, and exciting a spirit of independence. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
that receive parochial relief in one year is 40, and the sum allot- 
ted to each varies from 5s. to 6s. per man. This sum is procured 
from the weekly collections at church, and by an assessment on 
the heritors half-yearly when needed. The poor inhabitants are 
not by any means backward in applying to this fund for relief. 
There are few beggars, however, belonging to the parish ; but 
being a thoroughfare from the coast to England, whole families 
of poor Irish are usually to be found begging. Strangers, and 
starving, they must be assisted ; but it turns the supply for the poor 
at home into a different channel, and imposes a heavy burden upon 
the charitable and humane. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs in the year held for agricultural 
purposes. They are of little importance, and but thinly attended. 

Inns. — In this, as in almost every other part of the country, 
there are by far too many houses of public entertainment. There 
are ten mns and alehouses, and then effects upon the morals of 
the people decidedly bad. 

Fuel. — Coal is used for fuel in the village, which can be pro- 
cured at the rate of 2s. 6d. for 14 cwt., and the country part of 
the population use peat and coal indifferently. 

General Observations. 
Agricultural improvement has made rapid progress in the west 
of Scotland within the last fifty years ; and in no place has its be- 
neficial effects been productive of greater good than in this parish. 
Since the date of the last Statistical Account much has been ef- 
fected in meliorating the chmate, by relieving the surface of its 
stagnant water. Many fields have been brought under cultivation 
which were formerly covered with heather. The plantations then 
in their infancy have arrived at maturity, and prove, small as thev

are, wonderfully beneficial ; and the value of land has greatly in- 
creased. But though much has been done, there is still a wide 
field for improvement. The parish is still almost void of enclo- 
sures ; and without these, little can be expected from the most in- 
dustrious tenant. By far the greater portion of thie hill land is still 
overburdened with moisture, and destitute of shelter, — draining, 
therefore, and planting ought to be particularly attended to. The 
sheep-walk should be separated from the improvable land by stone 
dikes, and hedging and ditching used for dividing it into suitable 
enclosures. The larger farms ought to be reduced in size, as I 
am afraid little will be effected in the inbringing of land, so long 
as the farmer's whole . attention is engrossed with his sheep 
stock. 

Much of the parish still resembles an unexplored region,— 
thousands of acres are to be found in a state of nature, which could 
be easily added to the cultivated land. If the waste land in this 
and many other parts of Scotland were reclaimed, it would add 
greatly to the resources of the country, be a fruitful source of profit 
to the proprietors, and the means of promoting the happiness and 
comfort of the labouring-classes.

PRESBYTEEY OF AYR, SYNOB OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JOHN TOD, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of this parish was formerly spelled Mach- 
lein, or Machlene, or Machlin ; but of late it is more commonly 
spelled Mauchline, — Magh signifying " a field or meadow," and 
" linn or linne'' a pool or lake. Maghlinne, pronounced by the 
Scots who succeeded the Gael, Machlin or Mauchline, is the lake- 
field or meadow, and this etymology of the name corresponds with 
its original local description. As the fields around the town of 
Mauchline abound with numerous springs, they must have been 
anciently a marsh or meadow. 



MAUCHLINE. 



159 



Extent, Boundaries. — The parish of Mauchline Ues in the cen- 
tre of the county of Ayr, is about 8 miles in length, and from 
2 to 4 in breadth, containing about 24 square miles. It is bound- 
ed on the north, by the parishes of Craigie and Galston ; on the 
east, by the parish of Sorn ; on the south, by the parishes of 
Auchinleck and Ochiltree ; and on the west, by the parishes of 
Stair and Tarbolton. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is in general flat, ex- 
cepting Mauchline hill, which rises a little to the north-east of 
the town, and runs in a ridge, from east to west, about a mile in 
the parish, terminating at Skeoch hill, in the parish of Tarbolton. 
From the hill, there is a very extensive prospect, not only over a 
great part of Ayrshire, but as far as Cairnsmure, and other hills in 
Galloway, and Benlomond, Jura, Arran, Kintyre, &amp;c. This hill 
forms part of what is commonly known by the long ridge of Kyle. 
It rises about 1000 feet above the level of the sea. 

The air is milder and more temperate here than towards the 
eastern coast of Scotland. Owing to its proximity to the western 
coast, it is rather wet ; but, upon the whole, not unhealthy, neither 
are there any diseases pecuhar to this parish. 

Hydrography. — There are numerous perennial springs in the 
parish, particularly where the town is built, but as none of them 
have been analyzed, their chemical properties are unknown. 

The only loch in the parish, called Lochbrown, is about three 
miles north-west from the town. It covers sixty acres of ground. 
It would have been drained many years ago, had it not been for 
the sake of two corn-mills which it supplies with water. Wild- 
ducks, geese, and sometimes swans resort to it. 

The river Ayr runs through this parish, about a mile south of 
the town. In its course, it passes between steep rocks of red free- 
stone, from forty to fifty feet high. How this passage was form- 
ed, whether by some convulsion of nature, or by the water gradu- 
ally forming a channel for itself, cannot now be ascertained. The 
scenery is beautiful and romantic. On its banks there are various 
caves cut out of the solid rock, similar to those at Auchinleck, of 
which Dr Johnson has taken notice in his Tour to the Hebrides. 
One of them is known by the name of Peden's Cave, where it is 
said Alexander Peden whose name is so familiar to the inhabitants 
of the west of Scotland often concealed himself during the un- 
happy time of the persecution. 

About half a mile above Barskimming, the seat of Lord Glen-

AYRSHIRE. 



lee, the Ayr is joined by the waters of the Lugar. It afterwards 
runs a course of ten miles, and joins the Frith of Clyde at the town 
of Ayr. 

Geology. — The soil in the parish is various, for the most part of 
a clayish nature, except some fields about MauchMne, which are of 
a light sandy or mixed kind. A few fields consist of a deep loam, 
well adapted for every kind of crop. On the south side of the pa- 
rish there are extensive strata of red freestone, in many places up- 
wards of forty feet in depth. On the north side, white freestone, 
limestone, ironstone, and also coal abound, but the thickness of the 
strata is inconsiderable. 

Botany. — The following is a list of the more rare plants in the 
parish, and the spots where they are to be found : Vaccinium 
oxycoccos, creeping bilberries or cranberries, found on the rocks 
near the Ayr ; Asperula odorata, sweet-scented woodruff ; Campa- 
nula uriicifolia, nettle-leaved bell-flower, — these two are found in 
woods : Botrychium lunaria, moonwort, found upon the plea- 
sure-ground of Barskimming ; Scolopendrium officinarum, harts- 
tongue ; Hypericum Androsa'mum, tutsan, St John's wort ; Vinca 
minor, less periwinkle ; these three found in the woods on the 
banksof Ayr : Trollius iztro/xKMs, globe-flower, also on the banks; 
Drosera rotundifolia, round-leaved sundew; Drosera longifolia, 
long-leaved sundew ; Comarum palustre, marsh cinque foil ; the 
three last, found in the Kipple moss, on the estate of Barskimming : 
Serapias latifolia, helleborine, under the shady beeches : Daphne 
laureola, spurge-laurel; Lycoperdon tuber, truffle, found aiTiong the 
woods in various parts. 

Soil. — The soil seems well adapted for the growth of trees, the 
young plantations being remarkably thriving. They consist most- 
ly of firs, ashes, oaks, and beeches. On the estate of Barskim- 
ming there are larches of very great dimensions. They were among 
the first of the kind that were brought to this country. They were 
at first carefully preserved in hot-houses. They are now the tallest 
trees in the woods. In the churchyard of Mauchline, in the centre 
of the town, there is an ash 15 feet in circumference, containing 
upwards of 300 solid feet. On its top a colony of rooks have fixed 
their residence. The age of this tree is unknown. 

II. — Civil History. 

There is no connected history of the parish. It was on ce a priory, 
belonging to the Abbacy of Melrose, and when that abbacy was 



MAUCHLINE. 



ICI 



erected into a temporal lordship, the lands and barony of Kiles- 
mure and Barmure, and the patronage of the church of Mauchline, 
were given to the Lord of Loudon. This parish formerly includ- 
ed the parishes of Sorn and Muirkirk, and a great part of the pa- 
rish of Tarbolton. There is no tradition of any battle in the pa- 
rish, except one, at Mauchline Muir, between the King's party and 
the Covenanters, about the year 1647, when the former was defeat- 
ed, and their military chest was found, it is said, many years after, 
hidden in the ground. 

Upon the farm of Mosgiel, in this parish, Burns resided nearly 
nine years. Here he composed some of his most celebrated poems. 
While living here, by the advice of his generous patron, G. Ha- 
milton, Esq. he published the first edition of his poems, which 
have immortalised him as Scotia's bard. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners are, Claud Alexander, 
Esq. of Ballochmyle ; His Grace the Duke of Portland; Lord 
Glenlee ; Sir James Boswell of Auchinleck, Bart. ; William 
Campbell, Esq. of Netherplace; George Douglas, Esq. of Roding- 
head ; Mrs Wallace of Cairnhill ; Colonel Stewart of Catrine ; 
and Captain Campbell of Roughdyke. 

Parochial Registers. — The ancient parochial records are now 
lost. Sometime before the Reformation, the Popish clergy per- 
ceived their interest declining, and their downfal approaching in 
the kingdom. To prepare for the worst, they sold their lands in 
small parcels for ready money, and then departed, carrying with 
them all their money and effects, and the books and registers be- 
longing to this, and, it is believed, to other parishes in the neigh- 
bourhood. The date of the earliest entry in the parochial regis- 
ter is 17th January 1670. The whole records of the parish are 
contained in ten volumes. Till about eighty years ago, they were 
most irregularly kept, being written mostly on detached leaves, so 
that they are almost useless. 

Antiquities. — At the town-head of Mauchline, on the Green, 
there was a tombstone, from which it appeared that five men were 
put to death under the unhappy reign of James VU. of Scotland. 
Under their names were the following Hnes : 

" Bloody Dumbarton, Douglas and Dundee 
Moved by the Devil and the Laird of Lee, 
Dragged these five men to death witli gun and sword, 
Not suffering them to pray nor read God's word ; 
Owning the work of God was all their crime. 
The eighty-five was a saint-kilting time." 

In 1830, this tombstone was lifted, and a monument erected by

subscription in its place. On this monument the above inscription 
has been carefully preserved. 

Modem Buildings.— kmong the modern buildmgs, the only one 
worthy of notice is the new church, opened for public worship on 
the 2d day of August 1829. The old church, after having stood 
upwards of six centuries, was found to be both inconvenient and 
unsafe, and was taken down in 1827, and the present church erected 
on the same site. It is built of red freestone, chiefly in the Go- 
thic style. It stands in the centre of the town, surrounded by the 
churchyard, which is used as the pubUc burial-ground.' On the 
east end of the church stands the tower, about 90 feet in height, 
and ornamented on the top with turrets. The inside of the church 
is plain, containing enclosed pews. The galleries are supported 
by slight cast-iron pillars. The pulpit is highly ornamented. The 
whole is well lighted. It is reckoned the most elegant church m 

this part of the country. 

III. — Population. 
The population in 1755, according to Dr Webster, was 1169. 
Since that time it has been gradually increasing. The cause of the 
increase is not very obvious. It may arise in part from the impor- 
tation of Irish, and partly from the encouragement given to weavmg 
in this part of the country, by the Glasgow, Paisley, and Kilmar- 
nock manufactories.

IV. — Industry. 

Agricultia-e. — The whole of this parish is arable except a small 
moss of about six acres, and some declivities on the banks of the 
Ayr, now covered with plantations. All the farms are inclosed and 
subdivided. The total number of acres is 5782, of these 5400 are 
cultivated or occasionally in tillage, leaving 332 under wood, either 
natural or planted. The kind of trees generally planted, is fir, larch, 
ash, oak, beech, plane. On marshy ground the alder, willow, pop- 
lar, &amp;c. are planted. The mountain-ash, hazel, birch, are indige- 
nous. The proprietors of the woods are careful in having them pro- 
perly thinned and pruned. , 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land per acre is L. 1, 5s. The 
average rent of grazing is at the rate of \j. 3 per ox, or cow grazed, 
and at the rate of 15s. per ewe, or full-grown sheep pastured for the 
year, 15s. There is no stated rate of labour in the parish. 

Husbandry. — The principal improvement which has recently 
been made in agriculture is that of furrow draining, and nothing 
but the expense of this plan prevents it from being generally adopt- 
ed. The few spirited individuals who have drained their land in 
this manner have been well repaid. In many instances, the value 
of the land has been doubled, and in some places what was for- 
merly barren has been rendered most fertile. 

The general duration of leases is nineteen years. Some land- 
owners let their land for a shorter period, but this is unfavourable to 
the occupier, as he is prevented from entering into any plan of im- 
provement, lest at the expiration of his lease, his farm should be let 
to another. Others let their farms from year to year, but this plan 
is injurious both to the owner and the occupier, as the lands remain 
unimproved, and the houses and fences are allowed to fall into 
decay. 

The greastest obstacle to improvement arises from the high rents 
paid for the land. Some proprietors imagine, that, by letting their 
farms to the highest bidder, they will thus make more out of their 
estates, never reflecting that the tenant will very soon be unable to 
pay them, or to carry any plan of improvement into execution, 
through want of capital. 

The farm houses are in general large and commodious, particu- 
larly on the estate of Ballochmyle, which contains about two -fifths 
of the whole parish. The houses have almost all been lately built, 
two storeys high, slate roofed, with convenient office-houses. The 
farms are all inclosed and subdivided by thriving thorn hedges. 

Quarries. — There is an excellent red freestone quarry near the 



164 



AYRSHIRE. 



town, mostly employed for the building of houses. There are also 
other two of white freestone, near Deacon hill, about three miles to 
the north-west, the stones of which are much esteemed for their 
fine grain and colour, and, on account of their durabihty, are in re- 
quest for pavement, tombstones, &amp;c. 

Limestone, ironstone, and also coal abound, but, owing to the 
thinness of the strata, the raising of them has now been aban- 
doned. 

Produce — The following statement contains the average gross 
amount of raw produce raised in the parish, as nearly as could be 
ascertained : 

Produce of grain of all kinds, either cultivated for food of man or the 

domestic animals, _ . - . L. 6865 10 0 

Of potatoes, turnips, cabbages, carrot and other plants cultivated in 

the fields for food, - - - - 2172 5 4 

Of hay, whctlier meadow or cultivated, - - 1Q53 0 0 

Of land in pasture, rated at L. 3 per cow, or full-grown ox grazed 

for the season, .... - 3600 0 0

Of miscellaneous produce not enumerated under any of the foregoing 

heads, - - - - 150 0 0 

Total yearly value of raw produce raised, L. 15,790 15 4 

Manufactures. — Under this head may be mentioned, the woollen 
manufactory at the village of Haugh, which employs upwards of 
thirty persons, who work eleven hours a-day, and are engaged five 
days and a-half per week. They are chiefly employed in spinning 
yarn for the carpet manufactory at Kilmarnock. Their wages de- 
pend upon the expertness of the workmen, as they are paid by the 
piece. 

In the town of Mauchline there is a very extensive manufactory 
of wooden snuff-boxes. In this work about sixty persons are em- 
ployed, who work ten hours a-day, and six days per week. The 
workmen are remunerated according to their knowledge of the art 
of box-making or painting. The stranger will be well rewarded 
by paying a visit to this work, as he will have an opportunity of 
seeing many elegant specimens of the art. 

The works are so conducted as to be injurious neither to the 
health nor the morals of the individuals engaged in them. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

The town of Mauchline is situated on the south side of Mauch- 

• The above statement is exclusive of the produce of the dairy, which, valued at 
L. 7 for each cow, but from which the expense of grazing must be deducted,  .11 
amount to L. 3656, and the sale of young cattle, which may amount to I.. CUU. 



MAUCHLINE.

line- Hill, about a mile distant from the river Ayr. It is neatly 
built, and contains 1364 inhabitants. It was formerly a burgh of 
barony ; but about 120 years ago the charter was lost, when the 
Register Office at Edinburgh was burnt, and it has never since 
been renewed. The principal branches of trade are, weaving, 
shoemaking, and snuff-box making. It is well governed by the- 
baron bailie and the justices of the peace in the neighbourhood. 

Villages. — There are two small villages in the parish, Haugh 
and Auchmillan, the former containing 80, and the latter 35 in- 
habitants. 

Means of Communication. — Mauchline being situated nearly in 
the centre of the county, enjoys easy means of communication 
with the most distant parts of the country. It has a post-office 
under excellent management ; and there are two turnpike roads, 
which cross each other at Mauchline; the one, from Ayr to Edin- 
burgh, runs in the parish from west to east about four miles ; the 
other, from Glasgow to London, from north to south, about seven 
miles in the parish. Alongst this line of road a stage-coach passes 
twice every lawful day. 

Over the river Ayr there are several very useful bridges near 
Mauchline, particularly the new bridge at Barskimming, built by 
the late Sir Thomas Miller. It excels all the bridges in the 
county in beauty and elegance, and is one of the greatest curiosi- 
ties to be seen in it. It consists of a single span, the length 100 
feet, height 90. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the middle 
of the town, nearly in the centre of the parish, in the most eligible 
situation that could have been chosen. It affords accommodation 
for 1 100 persons. The sittings at present are all free, — no division 
of the church having yet taken place. 

The manse was built in 1792, and is in good repair. The 
glebe consists of 7 acres of good land, and is worth L. 24 per an- 
num. The stipend consists of 15 chalders of grain, half meal and 
half barley, the price of which is regulated by the fiars price for 
the county. The number of Seceders is not great, there being 
only one dissenting chapel in the parish, belonging to those in 
connection with the Associate Synod, known formerly by the name 
of Burghers. Their minister is paid from seat-rents and from 
 collections, — the amount of the stipend being L. 125. The num- 
ber of families belonging to the Established Church may be stat- 
ed, 353; persons of all ages, 1784; communicants, 600. The 
number of families belonging to the chapel, 83 ; persons of all 



AYRSHIRE. 



ages, 448 ; communicants, 226. Tiiere are three Roman Catholics 
in the parish. 

A Bible and Missionary Society, in connection with the County 
Society, was instituted in this place in 1815. The amount of the 
contributions yearly was once L. 24, but since the dispute about 
pure circulation, it has greatly fallen off, — now scarcely amounting 
to L. 14. 

The amount of collections in the parish church for religious and 
charitable purposes exceeds L. 70 annually. 

The church and chapel are in general well attended. 

Education. — There are four schools in the town, and one at 
Crosshands, about two miles distant. There is only one parochial 
school, the other three in the town are unendowed. At the pa- 
rochial school, the branches of education taught are, English, 
writing, arithmetic, practical mathematics, Latin, Greek, and 
French. At one of the private schools, English, writing, arith- 
metic, Latin, and Greek are taught. The school in the country 
is endowed with a house and garden from the Duke of Portland. 
The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum salary, a garden, 
and is allowed L. 9 for house-rent. The amount of school fees 
about L. 60. The expense of education per annum, for English, 
10s.; writing, 12s.; arithmetic, 14s.; Latin, Greek, and French, 
16s. 

The children are sent young to school, generally about five 
years of age, so that they are able to read and write before they 
are nine. The people are so far alive to the benefits of education, 
as to have all their children taught to read ; writing and arithme- 
tic are less attended to. There are none in the parish upwards of 
fifteen years of age who cannot read. 

Literature. — There is a public library in the town, and a reli- 
gious tract and book society. The books in the library are not 
numerous. However, additions are made to them yearly. 5s. is 
paid at entry, and 3s. annually. 

Charitable and other Jiistitutions.—There are 8 friendly so- 
cieties in the town, the object of which is to make reciprocal pro- 
visions for their members while labouring under disease. Two of 
these societies have existed for twenty years. The funds of the one 
are L.240; of the other, L. 160,— the entry-money and quarter- 
ly accounts according to the age of the individual. The present 
allowance is 4s. weekly to such as are unable to work, and 6s. if 
confined to bed. Their regulations have been sanctioned by the 
Quarter-sessions, and certified to be in conformity to the provisions 



MAUCHLINE. 



167 



of the late act of Parliament. These societies are most beneficial to 
the place. They keep alive the spirit of independence, by prevent- 
ing any of their members from falling on the parish funds, and thus 
becoming regular paupers. 

A Savings Bank was established in 1815. The investments, 
mostly from the labouring classes, amount to L. 900 ; the sums an- 
nually invested about L. 140, while nearly as much is withdrawn. 

'Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid is 40. They are paid monthly, and receive 
5s. each on an average. The funds arising from church collections, 
mortcloth dues, &amp;c. L. 50 ; the annual expenditure, L. 120. The 
diflference is made up by an assessment annually agreed to by the 
heritors. None receive parochial aid but the aged and infirm, 
such as are unable to work for their own support, and whose rela- 
tions are unable to maintain them. It is considered degrading, so 
that none but the necessitous make application. 

Prison. — About six years ago, a lock-up-house, consisting of 
two cells, was built in the town. It is not designed as a place of 
long confinement. It serves the purpose of intimidating the dis- 
orderly. 

Fairs. — There are seven fairs in the town, chiefly for the buy- 
ing and selling of cattle. There is also a horse-race in the end of 
April. 

Inns, Alehouses, 8fc.. — There are two very good inns, besides 15 
alehouses and spirit-shops, but those who keep them commonly deal 
in other articles, as grocery goods, &amp;c. Alehouses, &amp;c. are evi- 
dently injurious to the morals of the people, as they lead to dissi- 
pation, with all its ruinous consequences. The justices of the peace 
in this district are careful that none obtain license but such as are 
of a good moral character. 

Fuel, consisting chiefly of coal, is brought from the neighbour- 
ing parish of Auchinleck, and also from the parish of Riccarton, a 
distance of eight miles, and costs 8s. per ton. Peat is procured 
from the parish of Sorn, and costs 4s. per cart. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written, many important 
alterations have taken place. The inhabitants are now better edu- 
cated, consequently more intelligent. Those superstitious obser- 
vances which were formerly counted oracular, and in which impli- 
cit confidence was placed, are now altogether neglected, or prac- 
tised merely for amusement. The existence of ghosts, witches, 
&amp;c. is now discredited. Fanaticism and bigotry hide their dimi- 



1G8 



AYRSHIRE. 



nished heads. People of different opinions in religion now regard 
each other as brethren. 

The employments of the labouring classes have undergone a very 
great change. The erection of cotton-mills upon an extensive scale 
at the neighbouring village of Catrine which have been conduct- 
ed with unexampled spirit and success has diffused comfort and 
happiness to all around. Here the labourer finds employment, and 
here the farmer finds a ready market for his produce. Spinning, 
weaving, tambouring, and sewing, have been extensive sources of 
employment. Common weavers have built for themselves houses, 
planted gardens, and lived in a style of ease and comfort. But 
there is a tide in the affairs of men ; within the last fifteen years, 
a variety of causes having brought on a stagnation in commerce, 
the most extensive calamity of the kind that has ever been felt in 
this country, which has swept away all the particular advantages 
of the weaver, till at last he is fully more the child of penury and 
toil than almost any other mechanic. Perhaps, with respect to real 
comfort, the labouring classes, taking them altogether, are at pre- 
sent rather behind what they were at the time of the last Statisti- 
cal Account. 

The system ofagriculture has also undergone a considerable change. 
Some thirty or forty years ago, this parish, like most of its neigh- 
bours, had gone far in adopting or imitating the agriculture of our 
eastern counties, and wheat, of course, formed the leading article in 
its cultivation ; nearly the whole stock of manure was annually ex- 
pended in supporting the new system ;. bear and barley were nearly 
abandoned ; even oats, which have always given, and which per- 
haps always will give, the most steady and certain return, began to 
be in a great measure neglected. Alongst with wheat, summer 
fallow and green cropping were also adopted. But the system had 
not been many years pursued, before it was discovered that the 
soil and climate of this neighbourhood were decidedly unfavourable 
to its profitable continuance. So long, however, as the tear prices 
for grain were obtained, the system was enabled to prolong its 
feeble existence ; but the return of peace, with the consequent 
peace prices of agricultural produce, seems now to have, in this 
quarter, finally sealed the fate of the system. The soil of the pa- 
rish is not, indeed, generally suited for raising bear and barley, al- 
though a considerable portion of it is decidedly so ; and if to that 
portion of it only their cultivation were confined, they would most 
certainly yield a profitable return.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. THOMAS BURNS, MINISTER. 



L— Topography and Natural History. 
Name, History, Sfc. — The parish of Monkton received that 
name from its connection with the abbey of Paisley, that monastery 
having extensive and valuable possessions within the parish, which 
required the residence probably, and superintendence of a certain 
number of the monks, who, in these early times, were the only class 
of persons acquainted with agriculture, the construction and 
management of mills, &amp;c. &amp;c. It appears from the chartulary of 
the abbey of Paisley, that the original name was Prestwick ; and 
that in 1163, when that abbey was founded, both the churches 
of the united parishes were then in existence, and both called by 
the same name of Prestwick, Prestwick church being called St 
Nicholas's church of Prestwick, and Monkton church, St Cuth- 
bert's church of Prestwick. At a later date in the chartulary they 
are distinguished as Prestioic de hurgo, and Prestwic Monachorum ; 
and at the date of 1225 there occurs this casual notice of the lat- 
ter, — Prestwic— -quce nunc dicitur villa Monachorum. 

Both churches were bestowed upon the monastery of Paisley by 
its founder, Walter, the son of Alan the great steward of Scotland, 
in 1 163, together with the whole of that rich flat of land which 
now forms the parish of Monkton, with the exception of what 
lies on- the east side of the Powburn, which ]robably was attach- 
ed to the religious house of Ladykirk. The mill of Prestwick, now 
called Monkton mill, was added to this grant in 1368, when the

Paisley.

house of Dalmulin, Dalmelling, in the parish of St Quivox, a 
house of canons and nuns of the order of Sempringham or Gil- 
bertines, with all its possessions, of which Monkton mill was one, 
was made over to the monastery of Paisley. 

There is no record or tradition extant of any house or convent in 
Monkton, for the accommodation of these monks. Prestwick church 
is mentioned in the Paisley chartulary in 1212, as a chapel, and its 
minister as a chaplain {c.apellanus . Monkton church was a rec- 
tory, and continued to be so down to the Reformation. From the 
general appearance of the present church of Monkton, and in par- 
ticular from the existence of a Saxon arch over what was once the 
principal door, it is supposed to be the original structure : in that 
case it cannot be less than 700 or 800 years old. The bell bears 
the popish inscription of Sancte Cuthberti ora pro nobis, addressed 
to the tutelary saint of the church. It is not known when the pa- 
rishes were united. It appears from the records of the burgh of 
Prestwick, that up to the year 1570 the union had not taken place, 
as the ministers of both parishes are mentioned : whereas about 
1630 mention is made only of one, as being minister of both pa- 
rishes. The union probably was the result of necessity, viz. the 
want of adequate endowments. 

The parish is sometimes mentioned as the united parish of 
Monkton, Prestwick and Crosby. This is a mistake. Crosby 
never was a separate parish. In the chartulary above referred to, 
we have mention made of Dundonald, with its two chapels of Ric- 
carton and Crosby. The records of the Presbytery of Ayr, bear 
that, in 1651, the estate of Crosby at the request of its proprietor, 
was disjoined from the parish of Dundonald, and, for the sake of 
being nearer to religious ordinances, was joined to Monkton. In 
1688, however, it was again wholly reunited to Dundonald. It 
would appear that, subsequent to this latter date, the laird of Crosby 
erected the place of worship, the ruins of which still remain, for 
the accommodation of the neighbouring population, and it con- 
tinued for some time as a preaching station, and for a while had a 
minister of its own. 

The etymology of Prestwick, Priest-town, points to some ec- 
clesiastical origin, but as to what that is, neither record nor tradition 
furnishes the smallest light. 

Extent, 8fc. — Th.e parish extends to 3 miles in length, by 3 
in breadth, and contains between 9 and 10 square miles. It is 
bounded by the parishes of Dundonald, Symington, and Craigie, 

4 



MONKTON AND PRESTWICK. 



171 



on the north and north-east; by Tarbolton and St Quivox on the 
east ; by St Quivox and Newton on the south and south-east ; and 
by the Frith of Clyde on the west. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is flat and level, rising 
to a gentle elevation along the north and north-east boundary. 
The length of sea coast from the parish of Newton to where Monk- 
ton joins Dundonald parish is between 2 and 2 miles. The 
coast is low, flat, and sandy, with very shoal water. Numerous 
bluff's and low sand-hills covered with bent, lie along the shore. 

There are two inconsiderable streams in the parish, the larger 
of which, the Pow-burn, rising in Craigie parish, and faUing mto 
the sea at the boundary between Monkton and Dundonald, turns 
two corn mills in its course. 

Getdogy and Mineralogg— There are two seams of coal in the 
southern part of Prestwick lands. The upper seam, which is 
soft, and in some places foul and mixed with pyrites, has been 
wrought for upwards of thirty years. It is not now wrought, being 
nearly exhausted. It was within 6 or 7 fathoms of the surface. 
The under seam, at the depth of from 33 to nearly 40 fathoms, 
and 4 feet thick, is a cleaner, harder, and more splinty coal, and 
has been wrought for more than twenty years. It is now exhaust- 
ed to the south of Kingcase dike, a dike which divides all the metals 
on either side of it. This dike is of green whinstone, and crosses 
the Prestwick lands in a direction from east to west, and at ebb- 
tide its course can be seen running westward into the sea. It re- 
appears on the opposite shore of the firth, in the Island of Arran. 
In the opposite direction, eastward and inland, this dike has been 
traced upwards of 40 miles. As yet no coals have been wrought 
in the parish to the north of this dike. Only one stone quarry 
has been opened in the parish, viz. upon the Prestwick shore, 
from which excellent freestone, both white and red, are obtained. 
It is not wrought at present. The soil of the parish is various. 
Immediately along the sea-side, and over a considerable part of 
Prestwick lands, it is a light sand, so light as scarcely to be adapt- 
ed for tillage. Around the village of Monkton, and towards the 
eastern and southern bounds of the united parish, it consists of a 
fine deep loam, varying from a light and very productive sand to a 
strong rich earthy clay, all capable of producing every species of 
crop of the finest quality. To the north and north-east the soil is 
chiefly a tenacious clay, in some places of excellent quality, and 
susceptible of great improvement, in others, thin and poor, resting 



172

upon a cold bottom, and not so improveable. Very little of either 
is adapted to the diflFerent kinds of drill husbandry. 

II. — Civil History. 
At what period the union of the parishes of Monkton and Prest- 
wick took place is not known; but in all probability it was about 
the time of the Reformation, or shortly after it. The original pa- 
rish churches of both parishes are still standing, and up to May 
1 837 were used for the purposes of public worship. Thejnhabi- 
tants of Prestwick were entitled to have public worship performed 
in their own church, by the minister of the parish, every third Sab- 
bath. These churches are both very old. In the records of the 
burgh of Prestwick, mention is made of a Justice Aire being held 
in the burgh church, so far back as the year 1440. The church 
of Monkton is thought to be at least as old as that of Prestwick. 
Tradition says, that it is the same fabric in which Sir William 
Wallace attended divine service on the occasion of his having the 
remarkable dream mentioned in the seventh book of Blind Harry's 
poem. 

The parish formerly extended to the river Ayr, and compre- 
hended the present parish of Newton. In 1777, the inhabitants 
of Newton, in consequence of the defective accommodation in the 
parish churches, erected a Chapel of Ease for themselves. In 
1779, having purchased from Sir William Maxwell, at that time 
patron of the united parish, the right of electing their own minis- 
ter, and the consent of the heritors being obtained, Newton was 
erected into a separate parish quoad sacra ; the burgh of New- 
ton still continuing to bear their proportion of the stipend payable 
to the minister of Monkton, and of the expense of keeping the 
church of Monkton and Prestwick in repair. 

The burgh of Prestwick is very ancient, as appears from its pre- 
sent charter. This charter was renewed by James VI. as admini- 
strator for his son, " Henry, Duke of Rothsay, Earl of Kyle, 
Carrick, and Cunningham, Lord of the Isles," &amp;c. at Holyrood- 
house, 19th June 1600, and bears, that Prestwick was known to 
have been a free burgh of barony for the space of 617 years pre- 
vious to this renewal of its charter. Kyle, one of the three divi- 
sions of the county of Ayr, was itself subdivided into Kyle Stewart, 
and King's Kyle : the latter, extending from the river Ayr to the 
river Doon, had Ayr for its head burgh ; the former, extending 
from the river Ayr to the river Irvine, had Prestwick for its head 
burgh. Their charter allows them to choose a provost bailies,

cholas, the 6th of December. 

Land-oioners. — The chief land-owners of the parish are, Robert 
Reid, Esq. of Adamton, who also is patron of the parish ; R. A. 
Oswald, Esq. of Auchencruive ; W. G. Campbell, Esq. of Fair- 
field ; A. Murdoch, Esq. of Whiteside and Orangefield; The 
Duke of Portland ; and Lord James Stuart. The lands of Prest- 
wick are divided into thirty-six freedoms, of from fourteen to six- 
teen acres each in extent, of which from seven to eight acres may 
be good arable land. The rest was formerly in a state of common, 
but some years ago was divided and portioned out among the free- 
men. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers are the records 
of the kirk-session, and the register of births and baptisms. The 
earliest entry in the latter is in 1702. The former does not ex- 
tend so far back, the earlier volumes having been lost. Both are 
now kept with considerable regularity. 

Antiquities. — There are upon the estate of Ladykirk, the pro- 
perty of R. A. Oswald, Esq. of Auchencruive, the remains of a 
chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, called in old writings, Lady- 
kirk in Kyle. This estate was originally part of the barony of 
Adamton, and belonged to the family of Blair of Adamton, who 
were patrons of this chapel in Roman Catholic times. The build- 
ing formed a square with turrets at each corner, with the chapel in 
the middle. One of the turrets is all that remains of this ruin. 

Between Prestwick and Prestwick Toll, within fifty or sixty 
yards of the high road, are still to be seen the ruined walls of 
King- Case or King's Case, a charitable institution said to have been 
endowed by King Robert Bruce. Tradition says, that the Bruce, in 
consequence of great personal efforts in a hard-fought battle, was 
seized with an eruptive disease of the nature of leprosy ; and that 
upon his recovery from this disease, under the conviction that his 
cure had been mainly effected by drinking of the water of King- 
Case well, he built this lazar-house for the accommodation and 
relief of such as might be afflicted with the same disorder. 

" Kingcase. The history of this charitable institution is thus given by Chalmers in 
his Caledonia. " At Kilcais, which is .now called Kincase or Kingcase, on the coast 
of Kyle, in the parish of Prestwick, there was founded an hospital for leprous persons, 
which was dedicated to St Ninian. Tradition relates that the founder of this esta- 
blishment was King Robert Bruce, who was himself afflicted with leprosy, the re- 
sult of hard fare, hard living, and hard work. This hospital was endowed with the 
lands of Robert-loan, which is now called Loans, in Dundonald parish ; with the lands 
of Sheles and Spital Sheles in Kyle Stewart, and with other lands which cannot

III. — Population. 

According to Dr Webster's report, the population of the unit- 
ed parish, including Newton, amounted in 1755 to 1163; and as 
the population of Newton in 1779 amounted to between 800 and 
900, the separate population of Monkton and Prestwick, in 1755, 
could not be more than 400. The subsequent increase, to the 
present amount of 1818, is to be attributed partly to the improve- 
ment in the system of agriculture, and the increased expenditure 
of labour and capital upon the soil ; and partly, and perhaps in a 
greater degree, to the increase of the cotton manufactures, and 
the influx of Irish weavers employed in them, into the parish. 

The number of inhabitants residing in the country is 346 ; in 
the three villages of Monkton, Prestwick, and Prestwick Toll ; 
there being 376 in Monkton; 758 in Prestwick; and 327 in 
Prestwick Toll. 

There are only two gentlemen of independent fortune resident 
in the parish, viz. Mr Reid of Adamton, and Mr Campbell of 
Fairfield, both heritors in the parish. 

There are in the parish ten separate properties of the annual 
value of L. 50 and upwards.

The number of illegitimate births in the parish during the last 
three years, as nearly as can be ascertained, was 14. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of acres, Scotch measure, in the pa- 

now be specified. As the foundation charter of this hospital does not exist, it cannot 
be ascertained what number of persons were originally maintained in it. It appears, 
however, to have been governed by a guardian, or prior, and it had a chaplain. In 
the reign of James U., Wallace of Newton acquired the lands of Spital Sheles, which 
belonged to this hospital, as the name implies, and the hereditary office of keeper, or 
governor of the hospital, and of the lands belonging to it. In January 1515-16, all 
these were resigned by Hugh Wallace of Newton, in favour of his brother Adam. 
After the whole property of this hospital was thus granted away, the only revenue 
that remained to it was the feu-duties, payable from the land, in this manner grant- 
ed in fee-farm ; and these, amounting to 64 bolls of meal and 8 merks Scots of money, 
with sixteen threaves of straw for thatching the hospital, are still paid. For more 
than two centuries past, this diminished revenue has been shaved among eight objects 
of charity, in equal shares of eight bolls of meal, and one merk Scotch to each. The 
leprosy having long disappeared, the persons who are now admitted to the benefit of 
this charity, are such as labour under diseases which are considered incurable, or such 
as are in indigent circumstances. The right of appointing these belonged to the 
family of Wallace of Craigie for a long time, and was purchased about 1790 in 1787 
by the burgh of Ayr, which still holds this patronage. The old hospital, which exist- 
ed in the ' better days of this charity, has been long in ruins.' In the description of 
Kyle, by Robert Gordon, in the reign of Charles I., he mentions ihe chapel of this 
establishment ; and says, that the persons admitted to the charity were then lodged 
in huts, or cottages in the vicinity." 



MONKTON AND PRESTWICK. 



175 



rish, which are either cultivated or occasionally in tillage, is about 
1800. The number never cultivated, or remaining constantly 
waste or in pasture is 570. There is little of these 570 acres that 
could, with advantage, be added to the cultivated land of the pa- 
rish. The only common in the parish is that of Prestwick, which 
was some years ago divided and appropriated. The number of 
acres under wood is about 50, mostly planted. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of land in the Monkton half 
of the parish, including 170 acres of sand-bluffs and links on the 
sea side, is L. 2, 6s. per Scotch acre ; and over the united parish 
L. 1, 17s. 3d. per acre. The average rent of summer grazing may 
be stated at L. 4, 10s. for an ox or milch cow ; and L. 2, 10s. for 
young cattle. 

Husbandry.— The state of husbandry in the parish may be said 
to be in a very advanced stage of improvement. Surface-drainmg 
in every alternate furrow, with tiles and stones, has been adopted 
with the best effects in some of the best land in the parish. The 
leases are generally of nineteen years. 

The farm-steadings are generally good, and upon some of the 
larger farms have been erected in a very complete style, and at 
great expense. 

Surface draining, and feeding off the turnip crop on the ground 
with sheep, appear to be the most important improvements lately 
introduced into the husbandry of the parish. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish has been ascertained with a considerable attention to 
minuteness and accuracy, and is as follows, viz. 

Produce of grain of all kinds, whether for food of man or domestic animals : 
Whiat, - - L- 3,032 19 0 
Oats, - - 2,856 17 0

Total amount of raw produce, L. 1 2,573 6 0 
The total rental of the parish is, L. 4,309. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The nearest market-towns are Ayr, at the distance of 4 miles 
from Monkton, and 2 from Prestwick ; Kilmarnock, at the dis- 
tance of Smiles from Monkton, and 9 from Prestwick; and Irvine, 



176 AYRSHIRE. 

at the distance of 7 miles from Monkton, and 8 from Prest- 
wick. 

Villages. — The villages in the parish are three, Monkton, Prest- 
wick and Prestwick Toll, with populations respectively of 376, 758, 
and 327. 

Means of Communication. — The post-town is Ayr. The parish 
is intersected, 1st, by the great road from Port-Patrick and Ayr 
to Kilmarnock and Glasgow — length of this road within the pa- 
rish miles : 2d, from Ayr to Irvine and Saltcoats, &amp;c. — length 
of which within the parish is 3  miles : 3d, from Mauchline and 
Tarbolton to Irvine, &amp;c. — length of which within the parish is 3 
niiles : 4th, from Cumnock, and Coylton, and St Quivox, to Irvine, 
&amp;c. — length of which within the parish is 2 miles. The turn- 
pike roads all intersect each other at the same point, in the village 
of Monkton. 

Besides the mail-coach, six public coaches pass through Monk- 
ton and Prestwick every day, three early in the morning from Ayr, 
two of them to Glasgow, and the other to Edinburgh; and three 
in the afternoon to Ayr, one of them from Edinburgh, and the 
other two from Glasgow. Besides these, a regular diligence leaves 
Kilmarnock for Ayr in the morning, and returns in the afternoon, 
and another, three times a-week, leaves Irvine for Ayr in the morn 
ing, and returns in the afternoon. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The union of the two parishes has been 
completed by the competent legal process before the Court of 
Teinds, and presbytery of Ayr. These courts, by decreet dated 
4th June 1834, granting authority for the suppression of the two 
old churches, and for the erection, on an intermediate situation, of 
one new church, sufficient to accommodate the united parish. A 
very handsome new church, accordingly, has been built on a com- 
manding situation, adjacent to the Pow-bridge, and calculated to 
contain 825 sitters, that number being exactly two-thirds of the 
examinable persons in the parish. It reflects the highest credit 
on the architect, David Bryce, Esq. Edinburgh, and forms one of 
the most striking objects in the surrounding landscape, and one 
of the handsomest churches in the west of Scotland. Including 
the purchase of ground, gates and surrounding walls, &amp;c. &amp;c., it 
cost about L. 2500, and was opened for public worship on the 
14th of May 1837. 

The manse was built in 1822. The glebe, including the gar- 
den and the ground occupied by the manse and offices, is about 8 

3 



MONKTON AND PRESTWICK. 



177 



Scotch acres in extent, and for the last fifteen or sixteen years rent-, 
ed at from L. 5 to L. 5, 5s. per acre. The stipend is 17 chalders 
of victual, half meal, half barley, with L. 8, 6s: 8d, as allowance 
for communion elements. About 600 persons regularly attend 
church since the new church was opened. There are about 200 
Dissenters, young and old, of all persuasions, in the parish ; of 
these about 60 are Roman Catholics. Divine service is attended 
with considerable regularity in the parish church. The number 
of communicants is about 400. The average of collections in the 
old church was about L. 33 annually. The average collections in 
the new church cannot yet be given. 

Education. — There is one parochial school in Monkton, attend- 
ed by between 100 and 130 children. In Prestwick there is one 
private school, attended by from 40 to 50 children. There are 
also two Sabbath evening schools, attended by from 160 to 180 or - 
200 children, most of whom do not regularly enjoy any other means 
of education. The branches of instruction taught in the two day 
schools are, English reading, English -grammar, writing, arith- 
metic, practical mathematics, and, when pupils offer, the elements 
of the Latin language. The parochial schoolmaster has the maxi- 
mum salary, with a house, school-house, and a garden of the sta- 
tutory extent. The teacher in Prestwick has the use of the town- 
house of the burgh for a school-house ; and the burgh usually make 
him an annual allowance for rent of dweUing-house. The school 
fees, are, for English reading alone, 2s. 6d. per quarter ; for read- 
ing and writing, 3s. 6d. ; and for all the other branches taught, 4s. 
It is believed there are very few, if any, in the parish unable to 
read, and parents in general are very much alive to the benefits of 
education. The number of schools is sufficient for the parish. 

Poor. — There are from 15 to 20 poor receiving regular paro- 
chial aid, to the amount of from 3s. to 4s. a-month. There are 
also others receiving occasional aid. The annual amount of con- 
tributions for their relief may be stated at about L. 50 Sterling, of 
which L. 35 is collected at the church door, L. 10 is raised by vo- 
luntary subscription among the heritors, and the rest is made up 
by fines, proclamation dues, &amp;c. &amp;c. There is still remaining 
among the poor a considerable reluctance to apply for parish re- 
lief, if it can by any means be avoided. 

Prison. — There is one prison in the burgh of Prestwick, which 
is about to be rebuilt. Imprisonment is not frequent. There are 
four public .houses in Prestwick toll, four or five in Prestwick, and 

AYR. M 



178 



AYRSHIRE. 



four in Monkton; a number much greater than is required, and 
certainly not favourable to the moral habits of the people. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in the parish is universally coal, which is 
procured, the best of it, from the collieries in the neighbourhood of 
Kilmarnock, also from Newton, and from the colUeries on the 
water of Ayr, at an expense, including carriage, of between 5s. and 
5s. 9d. per single horse cart. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The most striking change in the parish since the date of last 
Statistical Account, is in regard to the agriculture, the mode of 
farming, and the amount of farm produce raised, and of the rental 
of the parish. At the date of last Statistical Account there was 
little or no wheat sown ; now the annual value of wheat raised is 
L. 3032, 19s. In 1791 the amount of oats raised in this parish was 
1315 bolls, and of bear or barley, 399 bolls ; now the annual value 
of oats raised is L. 2855, and of barley L. 119. In 1791 there 
were 6 or 7 acres of turnips, and 23 or 24 acres of potatoes ; now 
the annual amount of potatoes and turnips raised is 215 acres, 
valued at L. 3092. And finally, in 1791, the rental of the parish 
was supposed to be between L 1800 and L. 2000 ; now it is 
L. 4509, 17s. The chief improvement in the husbandry of the 
parish is tile-draining in every furrow, or every alternate furrovv-, 
which might be applied to a large portion of the parish with the 
most important results. And the chief error in the system seems 
to be too frequent white-cropping, as it appears, even under the 
best management in other respects, to be impairing the productive- 
ness of the soil.

THE REV. ROBERT STIRLING, MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
Extent and Boundaries.— Tu parish of Galslon is situated in 
the district of Kyle. Its greatest length is about 13 miles, and 
its greatest breadth about 4; but its figure is very irregular, and 



GALSTON. 



179 



accordingly its superficial extent is found to be scarcely 23 square 
miles. It is bounded on the east by the river Aven, which divides 
it from the parish of Avendale ; on the north by the Irvine, which 
separates it from Loudon and Kilmarnock; and on the west by the 
Cessnock, which divides it from Riccarton and Craigie. Its 
southern boundaries, by which it is separated from Mauchline and 
Sorn, are not so easily described. 

Geology.— The highest land in the parish is called Distinct- 
horn, about 1100 feet above the level of the sea. This hill, 
which is near the south-east extremity of Galston, is chiefly 
composed of old red sandstone, but is found to be frequently inter- 
sected with whin dikes. A quarry has been wrought about a mile 
and a half to the north of this hill, from which a great quantity of 
excellent pavement and roofing-slate has been procured ; and it 
has been remarked by the workmen, that the sandstone becomes 
valuable for these purposes, only where it comes to be nearly in 
contact with the whinstone, by whose vicinity it appears to have 
been very much indurated. To the north-west of this, is Molmont 
Hill nearly 1000 feet high, which is formed of trap rocks, such 
as trap tuff, amygdaloid, porphyry, &amp;c. and still farther to the 
north and west, are found the usual coal measures belonging to 
the coal basin of Ayrshire. It has been remarked of the coal 
mines in Galston, and, indeed, of the Ayrshire coal field in gene- 
ral, that the operations of the miner are frequently interrupted by 
troubles or whin dikes, which render the working of the coal both 
expensive and difficult. The general dip of the strata throughout 
the parish is north-west. The only mineral deserving of notice, as 
peculiar to this parish, is an ornamental stone commonly known by 
the name of Galston pebble. It is found at the west end of Molmont 
Hill, in the channel of the Burn Ann, which runs into the Irvine at 
Galston, and it is situated in a bed of hard clay of a greenish co- 
lour, probably tinged with chrome. There is also found on the 
top of the last mentioned hill, a vast number of nodules of agate 
and calcedony, most of them containing quartz crystals in the cen- 
tre, and very few of them exhibiting beautiful colours. 

Soil. — The general character of the soil in the higher and 
eastern parts of the parish is loamy and sandy, with a consider- 
able tendency in many places to peat ; in the lower and western 



 There is a considerable number of eminences in this parish, which are covered 
or capped with whin rocks. 



180 



AYRSIIIRK. 



parts, the most prevalent soil consists of different varieties of clay. 
In the eastern parts, which are generally covered with heath, there 
are found many trunks of trees of considerable magnitude. One 
of these was lately dug up from a piece of mossy ground, which 
appears formerly to have been a small lake aboQt 500 feet above 
the level of the sea. It proved to be a magnificent oak with a 
straight trunk, which had once been upwards of 48 feet long, and 
is still about 3| feet in diameter at the upper extremity. Two 
large pieces in good preservation are now kept at Lanfine garden. 
Whether this tree and its fellows already mentioned, are to be re- 
garded as the remains of the Caledonian Forest mentioned in the 
Classics, or to be referred to a still more ancient epoch in the his- 
tory of our globe, must be left for the decision of more competent 
authorities than the writer of this account. 

Along the south bank of the Irvine, there are from 400 to 500 
imperial acres of rich holm land, which appear evidently to have 
been formed by successive deposits from the river. It is certain, 
at least, that the river has at some former period traversed almost 
every part of this rich tract ; and it may be remarked, to the same 
purpose, that the uniformity of the soil and subsoil throughout its 
whole extent, as well as the considerable difference of level at the 
two extremities, preclude the supposition of its having been depo- 
sited at the bottom of an ancient lake. 

Climate. — The climate of Galston partakes of the general cha- 
racter belonging to that of Ayrshire, being " rather moist but not 
unhealthy." From two rain guages kept at Lanfine, it appears 
that the quantity of rain in 1831, was 53.8 inches, and in 1832, 
46.12. It is proper to state, however, that the situation of Lan- 
fine is high, and the fall of rain considerably greater than about 
the village of Galston. 

Bruntwood Loch, with all its winged inhabitants, has disappeared 
under the grasping hand of modern agriculture, and although 
Loch Gait does not appear to have suffered from similar encroach- 
ments, it must now be described as an insignificant marsh. There 
is nothing worthy of notice in the zoology or botany of Galston. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities.— e\\her is this parish celebrated by the occurrence 
of any important event mentioned in history, unless the successful 
rencontre of the patriot Wallace with the English officer Fen- 
wick is to be regarded in that light. The cairn which is said to 
mark the locality of this battle, is still in existence in the vicinity 



GALSTON. 



181 



of Loudon Hill, though considerably diminished by the repair of 
the neighbouring stone-fences. The " rude fortification," how- 
ever, which is said in the former Statistical Account to have shel- 
tered this hero and his handful of followers, performed the same 
office to a much more numerous body of warriors, probably not 
less than 1000 years before. It is evidently a Roman camp, 
chosen and fortified with all the military science for which that 
celebrated people were distinguished. Its ramparts, though much 
reduced by time and the depredations of the husbandman, may 
be distinctly traced throughout its whole extent, and the Praeto- 
rian and Decuman gates are in a state of tolerable preservation. 
The original camp to which these remarks apply is 180 yards long 
and 114 broad ; but there is another inclosure upon a lower level 
towards the south, which seems to have been added upon a subse- 
quent occasion, to accommodate a larger force, or perhaps originally 
designed for the quarters of the aUies. This addition lengthens 
out the parallelogram to 258 yards. It does not appear that there 
have been any gates at the extremities of the Principia,and, indeed, 
it is not to be expected from the nature of the ground, which on 
the right and left sides slopes downwards for twenty or thirty yards, 
with the declivity of a rampart. Upon one of these slopes there 
was found in the year 1831, a silver coin in good preservation, hav- 
ing this inscription, ciESAR avgvstvs divi f. pater patri-e. 
This coin is now in the possession of Thomas Brown, Esq. the 
proprietor of the estate on which the camp is situated, who is also 
in possession of another Roman coin, found along with many more, 
a little to the eastward in the parish of Avendale, and inscribed 
Divvs ANTONINVS. Theso facts and observations taken in connec- 
tion with the existence of a Roman military way, which may still 
be traced on the opposite bank of the Irvine, furnish incontestable 
evidence that the parish of Galston has received at least one visit 
from the masters of the world ; and it furnishes a striking proof of 
the stupendous scale upon which that wonderful people conducted 
their affairs, that marches and encampments, too trivial to be re- 
corded in their military histories, have thus certified their own ex- 
istence during a period of not less than 1600 years. 

In connection with these Roman remains may be mentioned an- 
other military station on the Galston bank of the Aven, about two 
miles farther to the south. It is nearly surrounded by the river, 
and fortified, where it is not so, by a rampart and ditch. Its tra- 
ditionary name in the neighbourhood is Main Castle, which, as 



182 



AYRSHIRE. 



there is not the shghtest vestige of a castle in the modern sense of 
the word, involuntarily suggests to the classical scholar the Latin 
designation of Minoi-a Castra. In the absence of evidence, there- 
fore, to establish any other hypothesis, it may not improbably be 
conjectured to have contained a detachment of the army stationed 
on Allanton Beg. 

It is impossible to ascertain the present owners of all the coins 
which have been dug up at different times within the parish of 
Galston. Mr Brown of Lanflne is in possession of twenty-seven 
silver coins which have been found on different parts of his 
estate, and which bear the names of Alexander, David, and Ed- 
ward. 

Parochial Registers. — The parish records are very imperfect 
and mutilated previous to the date of 1692, from which time there 
is a regular series of baptisms and minutes of session. The earhest 
entry is dated 1568, and perhaps the most curious and interesting 
record, which bears the date of 1640, is a copy of the " Solemn 
League and Covenant," with the names of the subscribers belong- 
ing to Galston. The first names attached to this document are, 
" Alexander Wallace, minister of Galston, Cessnock, Lockhart of 
Barr, Stewart of Galston, Patrick Shaw of Sornbeg." The per- 
son here subscribing " Cessnock" is elsewhere designated Sir Hugh 
Campbell, who, with John Lockhart of Barr, were the principal 
heritors or proprietors of land at this time. 

III. — Population. 
The following statement exhibits the population of the parish of 
Galston for a period of seventy-five years : 

In 1775, it amounted to 1013 
1790, - 1377 

1801, - 2113 

1811, - 3009 

1821, - 3442 
1831, - 3655 

In 1831, the number of males was 1808 
females 1847 

The great cause of the increase of the population which ap- 
pears in the above statement has been the rise and progress of the 
cotton manufacture. 

The yearly average of births for seven years prior to 1832 was 1 10 
marriages, - . - 30 

deaths, ... 89 

 Though not strictly belonging to the antiquities of Galston, it deserves to be 
mentioned, that this gentleman is in possession of a very interesting collection of an- 
cient siiear heads, battle axes, &amp;c. commonly called Celts, as well as many other cu- 
rious remains of antiquity.'

The number of persons of different ages in 1832 was as follows : 

Under 15, - 1526 

Between 15 and 30, 1019 
30 and 50, 640 
50 and 70, 422 
Upwards of 70. - 81 • 
At the same period the number of unmarried men and widowers above 50, was 56 

unmarried women and widows above 45 was 1 27 

707 

Number of families, - . ' . , " " " i fiq 

chiefly employed in agriculture, - - - J'" 

in trade, manufiictures, or handicraft, - 413 

The average number of children now residing with their parents, 
or grandfathers or grandmothers is 3 for each family where 
there are any children, and the number of such families is 640. 

Of this population about 2300 live in villages, and are chiefly 
employed in the different branches of the cotton manufacture. A 
few of the weavers have lately begun to weave different kmds of 
fancy silk. The high wages which could formerly be earned at 
weaving and sewing have introduced among this class a taste for 
an expensive mode of living, which contributes greatly to abridge 
the real comforts of life, when wages are verging, as at present, to- 
wards the lowest ebb. Their condition, therefore, may be now re- 
ported as far from comfortable, and the discontent naturally aris- 
ing from this state of things has been greatly increased by the ig- 
norant or dishonest labours of political agitators, who have taught 
them to ascribe to oppression and misgovernment, what is chiefly 
owing to the multiplication of power looms, and other machinery. 
Whether it be owing to the vain hope of a more adequate remu- 
neration for their present form of labour, or a love of the ease and 
apparent independence connected with the cotton weaving trade, 
in which every man is literally his own task-master, the fact is cer- 
tain, that few have yet left it to engage in the labours of agricul- 
ture. The natural consequence is, that the rural labourers are 
still in the enjoyment of those high wages which the vicinity of 
manufactures generally produces, and being well fed, and not over- 
worked, their condition is generally comfortable, and they are con- 
tented. From this statement, it would be easy to infer the moral 
and religious character of the population, upon the general princi- 
ples of human experience. That of the farmers and their servants 
is, upon the whole, exemplary -and good; that of the manufac- 
turers, though it is often excellent, is in too many cases very de- 
fective.

IV. — Industry. 
The parish of Galston contains 14,577 acres, imperial measure, 
which may be distributed as follows : 

Arable land, - 9833 acres. 

Pasture and moss, - 3780 
Plantations, - - 964 

It is probable that 600 acres of the land which has not yet been 
cultivated might, with a little outlay, be subjected to the opera- 
tion of the plough. But this could be undertaken with no other 
view than to improve the quality of the pasture,— a remark which 
may be applied to nearly 1000 acres of what is above stated as 
arable. There is no unappropriated common in the parish ; but 
the proprietors of land in Galston, and even in a part of Riccar- 
ton, have a right to cut peat and turf in a certain part of Galston 
Muir. It will readily be believed, however, that in a country where 
coals are so abundant, and may be purchased at 4s. a ton, exclu- 
sive of carriage, this privilege is neither highly valued, nor fre- 
quently exercised. 

Bent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is 18s. lOd. 
per acre, and that of moorland pasture Is. Id. 

Husbandry. — The general duration of leases is nineteen years; 
but upon the estates of the Duke of Portland many of the farms 
have lately been put upon the English system, and the tenants 
have properly no leases, but occupy from year to year. This 
change does not appear to have been brought about for the pur- 
pose of getting rid of the old tenants, or of enhancing their 
rents ; still less has it been introduced to stop the progress of 
improvement. On the contrary, the farmer being liberally re- 
munerated, in case of removal, for any permanent improvement 
which he makes upon his farm, carries on his operations with 
confidence ; and the enlightened and wealthy proprietor has late- 
ly taken into his own hand the conduct of the most important 
species of improvement. He has erected works for the manufac- 
ture of draining-tiles, and procured persons of experience in the 
practice of draining ; and when any tenant wishes to have his farm 
improved in this way, he has only to carry the tiles to the field to 
be drained, and to furnish straw to cover them in cases where it is 
necessary, and the whole work is performed without any farther ex- 
pense to him, except the payment of a yearly sum proportioned to 
the distance at which the drains are placed. This distance varies 
from 14 to 18 feet, and the yearly sum paid by the farmer varies 



GALSTON. 



185 



in an inverse proportion, from 6s. 6d. to 5s. per acre. It is scarce- 
ly necessary to state, that the drains are placed in the furrows, and 
that, after they have been made, the breadth and position of the 
ridges is not allowed to be altered. If this improvement had been 
left to the spontaneous arid unaided exertions of the farmers, it 
would in all probability have gone forward very slowly, owing to 
the want of capital and enterprize, and still more to the proverbial 
caution of that class of men. In fact, the mere example of a simi- 
lar system of draining, which had existed in Ayrshire sometime be- 
fore the commencement of his Grace's operations in Scotland, had 
been found insufficient to give an impulse to the industry of the 
- farmer. But upon the liberal system above-described, which re- 
moves every considerable risk from the tenant to the proprietor, 
the operation of draining has been found so easy and beneficial, 
that the tile-works cannot supply the rapidly increasing demand. 
Nay, such has been the impulse given to agricultural enterprize 
by the extensive practical evidence of the advantages of thorough 
draining furnished from the estates of the Duke of Portland in 
Ayrshire, that tile works are now rising in all quarters, and it is 
probable that in a very few years these advantages will be shared 
by the whole county. 

Many and great improvements have also been made upon the 
estate of Lanfine by the late and present proprietoi-, particularly 
in the formation of many miles of good roads, in draining and re- 
claiming waste lands by bounties given to the tenants, and in ex- 
tensive and judicious plantations. On this estate alone there are 
now upwards of 800 imperial acres of thriving plantations, which 
promise to be highly beneficial as well as ornamental to that exten- 
sive property. The wood most commonly planted by Mr Brown 
is larch and other kinds of fir, with a mixture of oak, ash, elm, &amp;c. 
in places adapted to their growth. 

Nothing can be more strikingly at variance than the methods 
which are followed by the Duke of Portland and Mr Brown in the 
management of their plantations. The latter puts in the plants 
at first at distances of not less than a yard every way, and care- 
fully thins them as they advance in size ; while the former plants 
at less than half a yard, and allows no thinning, at least for many 
years, but what is accomplished by the stronger plants killing the 
weaker. 

" Noil nosti um inter vos tantas componerc lites." 

Experience has not yet fully decided, at least in the parish of 



186 



AYRSHIRE. 



Galston, to which of those methods the preference ought to be 
given. In the meantime, it may be expected that his Grace's 
system should at length produce the straighter and more useful 
wood ; while it is generally supposed that the protracted struggle 
for ascendency among the plants must considerably enfeeble and 
retard their growth. It is but justice, however, to state, that some 
oak woods around the old mansion-house of Cessnock, which were 
planted upon this system about twelve years ago, discover a 
luxuriance of growth which is very striking, and can scarcely be 
surpassed in plantations of the same species of tree upon a similar 
soil, whatever may be the system of management. For the fir 
tribe his Grace's method does not seem to be so beneficial. 

Farm- Buildings. — The state of the farm-buildings in this parish 
is in general good, and suited to the wants and habits of the far- 
mers ; and where it is otherwise there appears to be a rapid advance 
in the way of improvement. The fences are in many places very 
indifferent, while in others they have been greatly improved, and 
even rendered excellent by the practice of frequent scutching or 
pruning. 

Husbandry. — The system of agriculture almost universally fol- 
lowed in Galston is one which, however it may be condemned by 
the modern school, has at least the praise of being long establish- 
ed, and highly esteemed by those who practise it. It consists in 
taking two successive white crops, almost always of oats, and 
one crop of rye-grass hay, and allowing the land to lie in pasture 
during the remaining five years, which complete the rotation. It 
will readily be inferred from this statement, that the produce of 
the dairy is the object of primary consideration in this district, and 
accordingly it may be stated, upon a moderate computation, that 
at least 210 tons of cheese are annually produced in Galston. 

Live-Stock. — The breed of cows found in this parish is that 
which is commonly known as the Ayrshire breed, on the selec- 
tion and rearing of which, as well as upon the general manage- 
ment of the dairy, the farmers bestow great attention. The sheep 
on the few farms where that kind of stock is kept belong to the 
common black-faced breed. 

Produce. — It is impossible to ascertain with absolute correct- 
ness the gross amount of raw produce raised in this parish even 
for a single year, since but few of the farmers are accustomed to 
keep regular accounts, and some of them are rather averse to com- 
municate the results even when they can. The following state-

ment is founded upon many careful observations and inquiries in 
different parts of the parish, and though it be only the result of a 
combination of partial averages, will be found to be pretty near 
the truth. It certainly does not, upon the whole, exceed the truth.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toivn — Means of Communication. — There is no market- 
town in this parish, the nearest being Kilmarnock, which is five 
miles distant from the village of Galston. With this town as well 
as Glasgow, and indeed all parts of the kingdom, the communica- 
tion is easy by means of excellent turnpike-roads, of which about 
ten miles fall within the parochial boundaries. The parish roads 
amount to upwards of twenty miles, and are generally kept in very 
good order. There are two carriers who go to and return from 
Glasgow, each twice in a week, and one carrier to Kilmarnock, 
who goes every lawful day. There is also a daily communication 
with Ayr, Edinburgh, and all the intervening places, by means of 
a stage-coach, which passes through the village, and a coach from 
Glasgow to London by Dumfries passes through another part of 
the parish. There is a penny-post in the village, and a daily de- 
livery of letters. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the village 
of Galston ; and as there is here a population of nearly 1900 imme- 
diately contiguous to the church, its situation with regard to the 
general mass of the parishioners cannot be said to be inconvenient. 
At the same time there are several houses in the eastern part of 
the parish which are about eight miles distant from the village, and 
the regularity with which some of their inhabitants attend the parish 
church, in spite of its distance, must be acknowledged to be high- 
ly creditable to their religious character, as well as indicative of 
their attachment to the national establishment. The present 
church was built in 1808, on a neat and substantial plan, and is 
ornamented with a spire and clock. It affords sittings for 1020 ; 
of which number, however, there are not more than 250 appro- 
priated to the villagers, the rest being divided amongst the heri- 



188 



AYRSHIRE. 



tors and occupiers of land. About 50 of these sittings are strict- 
ly free, and for the remaining 200 a small rent is paid, rather 
for the purpose of appropriating them to the most regular occu- 
pants, than for defraying the expense of erection. The pro- 
duce, amounting to about L. 10 annually, is throwji into the poor's 
funds. 

The manse was built in 1795, aiid after undergoing the repairs 
which generally become necessary in a short time where houses 
are built by contract, it may now be reported as a good and com- 
fortable house. The glebe contains about 14 imperial acres, and 
the productive part of it may be stated at the annual value of L. 18. 
The stipend consists of the whole teinds of the parish, which 
amount to 202 bolls, 3 pecks, 3| lippies of meal ; 13 bolls, 1 fir- 
lot, 1 peck, I lippies of bear, and L, 5, 7s. 9|d. of money, besides 
L. 1, lis. 8d., paid by certain lands in the parish of Tarbolton. 

There is one Dissenting chapel in the village of Galston, which 
is occupied by members of the United Secession Church. The 
minister is supported by the voluntary contributions of his people, 
and the average amount of stipend is L. 110. 

The number of families under the exclusive superintendence of 
the parochial minister is 573, and the families connected with the 
different denominations of Dissenters amount to 169. The re- 
lative proportions of individuals connected as above is not so easily 
ascertained, but it may safely be stated to be still higher in favour 
of the Estabhshed Church. The average number of its communi- 
cants is 830. 

Education. — There are 5 schools within the bounds of this pa- 
rish, — in four of which the teachers undertake to give instruction 
in Latin, arithmetic and book-keeping, writing, English reading 
and grammar. The parish schoolmaster has the maximum 
salary appointed by Act of Parliament, and provision is made by 
the heritors for a salary of L. 5, 12s. to two of the other teachers. 
The fees at all these schools are 2s. 6d. per quarter for Enghsh 
reading, 3s. for writing, 3s. 6d. for arithmetic, and 4s. for Latin ; 
but as the higher branches always include the lower, the greatest 
sum paid by one pupil for education is 16s. a-year. With such 
facilities for instruction, it is not surprising that there should be 
scarcely a single native of the parish who cannot read ; but as this 
has happily been the case for many years, it is impossible now to 
ascertain the change which may have been produced upon the 
character of the parishioners by the universal prevalence of educa- 

4. 



GALSTON. 



189 



tion. Without doubt this universal capacity of reading, exercised 
as it is by a public library, containing a considerable number of 
useful and entertaining books, must have a powerful influence m 
increasing the enjoyments, and improving the morals of the people. 

Yet, notwithstanding the ample provision thus made for the 
education of youth, the state and prospects of the manufacturing 
community in Galston have for several years been such as to excite 
strong apprehensions that the education of their children would for 
the future be neither so general nor so complete. The wages of 
the hand-weavers have been so very low as to render it impossible 
for many of them to pay for the instruction of their children, even 
at the moderate rate of 10s. a-year. In these circumstances, the 
inhabitants of Galston have great cause to congratulate themselves, 
that the late Mr Charles Blair of Longhouse, one of the heritors 
of the parish, bequeathed the whole of his property, amounting to 
nearly L. 4000, for the erection and endowment of a free school. 
It is expressly ordered in Mr Blair's will, that no steps be taken 
for this purpose, till the free annual rent of his bequest amount to 
L. 200 a-year ; and on this account the parish will not begin to 
reap the actual benefits of this laudable institution till after the ex- 
piration of six or eight years. In the meantime, however, it is pro- 
per to state, that a legacy of L. 1000, left by John Brown, Esq. of 
Waterhaughs, for a similar purpose, has for many years furnished 
the means of clothing and educating six children from the parish 
of Galston, and as many from that of Loudon. It is scarcely ne- 
cessary to add, that these two charitable bequests have been put 
under the most judicious regulations, and that they promise to pro- 
duce the most extensive and beneficial effects upon the intellectual 
and moral state of the community. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons re- 
ceiving parochial aid for a period of seven years prior to 1832 was 
24 annually. The average allowance to each per year is L. 4, ] 8s. 
ditto per week. Is. lOd. The annual sum expended in their sup- 
port, L. 117, 4s. 9d. ; of which there arose from collections, &amp;c. 
L. 48, 18s. 9d. ; from assessment upon the heritors alone, 
L. 68, 6s. It must be remarked, however, that the number of 
poor, and the sum expended upon their maintenance, has greatly 
increased within the two years lately expired, so that the assessment 
for the poor alone amounted, in 1832, to L. 215. The great mass 
of the people are sufficiently sensible of the degradation that is in- 
separable from a state of dependence, and are sufficiently backward 



190 



AYRSHIRE. 



to apply for parochial aid. But there is a pretty numerous class of 
the manufacturing population who have been taught to found their 
claims for support not upon the statutes nor the legalized practice 
of the nation, and still less upon the principles of Christian charity; 
but upon some vague notions of natural right. It is not surprising 
that some persons of this class should neither be very solicitous to 
provide for their own independence, nor very reasonable in their de- 
mands when they come to stand in need of relief. 

Fairs. — There are annually four fairs in Galston, none of which, 
however, is of public importance. The most frequented are held 
on the third Thursday of April, and on the first Thursday of De- 
cember. 

Alehouses. — The number of alehouses or rather of whisky shops 
is 14, — a number which will be thought by far too great for the 
population. But little advantage would be gained by the mere di- 
minution of their numbers, if the deleterious fluid which they retail 
can be procured from the spirit-dealers at its present low price, and 
consumed as it is at present in the drunkard's own house, and even 
in the fields. 

There are now only four corn-mills and one lint or flax-mill. 
The paper-mill mentioned in the former report still remains, and 
two of the others have been converted into saw-mills. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
When the present state of the parish of Galston is compared 
with what it was in 1790, it will certainly be found in many re- 
spects to have undergone considerable changes, and, as far as out- 
ward appearances are concerned, great improvements. The sys- 
tem of agriculture is indeed nearly the same, and perhaps it is that 
which is best suited to the soil and climate. But the implements 
with which the husbandman now labours are far more perfect, and 
the skill and industry with which he conducts his operations much 
greater. The hand of taste has also adorned the barren moors 
with thriving woods and smiling pastures, and rendered the pros- 
pect from Molmont Hill fairer and more enchanting than ever. It 
is in the moral aspect of this parish that any thing like decay or de- 
terioration is to be found. The cotton manufacture, along with 
wealth and population, has introduced its too frequent attendants, 
vice and impiety. And although Galston has perhaps less reason 
to bewail these unhappy changes than many parishes in a similar 
situation, it must still furnish its quota to the accumulating mass 
of practical evidence which damps the benevolent aspirations of the

philanthropist, annihilates his Utopian visions of earthly perfection, 
and proves that even the blessings of civilization are always alloy- 
ed, and sometimes outweighed, by evils from which it seems to be 
inseparable.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JOHN BRYCE, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

■Mame. — Ardrossan is the only name by which this parish has 
been ever known. It may be derived from the Celtic words, Ard, 
high, ros, a promontory, and an, a diminutive, and may signify a 
highish promontory, which is descriptive enough of the small hill, 
on which the remains of the Castle of the ancient Barons of Ar- 
drossan still stand. 

Situation, Boundaries, c— This parish issituatedin the district 
of Cuninghame, the north division of the county of Ayr. If is 
bounded on the south-west by the Frith of Clyde ; on the norths 
east by Dairy; on the south-east by Stevenston and Kilwinning ; and 
on the north-west by West Kilbride. It extends in length about 6 
miles; its greatest breadth is about 4 miles ; and it contains, ac- 
cording to Robertson, about 1 1 square miles. 

Topographical Appearances.— The surface is a mixture of hilly 
and flat country, and almost all of it fit for the plough. From the 
south-east corner of the parish, for more than a mile, the ground 
along the shore may be described as an inclined plane of consi- 
derable breadth, gently rising towards hills of different heights, 
which nearly stretch across the whole parish. These hills increase 
in height towards the north-west, and also approach nearer the 
shore, where they terminate in steep banks, which bear evident 
marks of having at one time been washed by the sea. The highest 
hill in the range is Knocligeorgan, which is upwards of 700 feet 
above the level of the sea ; from which, when the atmosphere 
is favourable, the hills in ten counties may be easily seen. The 
others are of various elevations, to about 400 feet. Clumps of 



192 



AYRSHIIIE. 



trees cover the summits of many of them ; and it were desirable 
that these were more in number, both for shelter and ornament. 
From this ridge towards the north-east, the ground dedines some- 
what, but still presents a considerable inequality of surface. 

Coast. — There is a sea coast of three miles, taking the direct 
line from Saltcoats to Kilbride; but following the curvatures of the 
shore, considerably above four miles. The general character of 
the shore is flat. Between Saltcoats and Ardrossan there is a 
beautiful sweeping bay, about three quarters of a mile in length, 
with a fine sandy beach, which forms a favourite promenade to 
strangers in the sea-bathing season. At Ardrossan the shore be- 
comes more irregular and rocky. Ridges of shelving rocks stretch 
out to a considerable length on both sides of the Inch, an islet at 
high water. Beyond Ardrossan on the north-west, there is an- 
other bay of greater extent than the one on the south side. From 
this to the junction of the parish with Kilbride, the coast presents 
little indentations : the shore becomes more stony and uneven ; oc- 
casional ridges of rocks are visible at low water ; and a few spe- 
cimens of boulder-stones may be seen. 

Islands. — About a mile off the harbour of Ardrossan towards 
the north-west, there is a small islet, called the Horse Isle, which, 
according to Pont, takes its name, not from horses being pastur- 
ed in it, " bot from ye surname of Horsse of ye Philipe Horsse, 
sone-in-law to Sr Richard Morwell, who, in old evidents, wes 
stylled Phillipus de Horssey, Janitor Coraitis Gallovidise." It 
contains about twelve acres of good pasture, with a tolerable sup- 
ply of fresh-water. It lies very low, and there is a beacon-tower 
erected upon it for the benefit of seamen, by the late Earl of 
Eglinton. It is to be regretted that a light-house had not been 
estabhshed instead of it. "With a view to procure one, petitions 
from all the towns on the coast were, some years ago, forwarded 
to the Commissioners of Light-houses, but their prayer has not yet 
been granted. 

Climate — The climate is in general mild and pleasant, the 
sea breeze moderating both the heat of summer and the cold of 
winter. There is no disease which may be said to be peculiarly 
prevalent in this parish. The dryness of the soil, the absence of 
marshes, and the constant sea breeze, tend to render it very healthy. 
Cholera, which was so ftital in the neighbouring towns of Steven- 
ston. Dairy, and Kilbride in 1832, never appeared here. Typhus 
and other epidemics occur occasionally, but they are always 



ARDROSSAN. 



193 



of short continuance. The quaint though equivocal commen- 
dation of the climate by a medical practitioner is, " that fevers 
won't live with us." The great resort of valetudinary people here 
in the season of bathing is an evidence of the general opinion of 
its salubrity. And the great age to which many of the people at- 
tain is an indubitable proof of it. 

Hydrography. — There is no stream in the parish deserving the 
name of river. Two small streamlets, the Stanley and Monfode burns, 
descend from the higher grounds to the shore on each side of Ar- 
drossan ; and a third, the Munnock, or Caddel Burn, considerably 
larger, in the upper part of the parish, falls into the Caaf, which di- 
vides the parish on the north-east from Dairy. There is abundance 
of springs, and the water good. Near the shore, however, and espe- 
cially in the town of Ardrossan, the water is hard and somewhat 
impregnated with the carbonate of iron, which makes it, though 
wholesome enough, not so useful for cooking and washing. At 
a very small expense, water of an excellent quality, and in sufficient 
quantity, could be brought from the high grounds, to supply both 
the town and harbour of Ardrossan. There is a small chalybeate 
spring between Saltcoats and Ardrossan, but it has never been 
analysed, and its virtues are unknown. 

Mineralogy. — Coal is said to be found throughout nearly the 
whole parish ; and in the northern part and neighbourhood of 
Saltcoats, it has been wrought to a considerable extent. At pre- 
sent there is no coal wrought. There are three limestone quar- 
ries in the upper part of the parish, which are wrought more or 
less. Two of them are the property of Lord Eglinton, and the; 
other of Archibald Cuninghame, Esq. of Caddel. The tenants 
on their respective properties are kindly allowed the use of these 
quarries gratis. The lime is of a good quality, and the quarry on 
Girthill being level free, the stone is dug at present for about a 
shilling per ton. Freestone, both red and white, is very abundant. 
At the town of Ardrossan, there is a large quarry of the former, 
of which the quay and many of the houses in the town are built. 
In this quarry, Robertson says, that petrifactions of wood were 
met with, apparently of fir; in some cases with the bark entire. 
Since the formation of the railway, the facility with which stone of 
a superior quality can be procured from the Stevenston quarry 
has almost superseded the working of the Ardrossan freestone. 
At Ardrossan, too, are found various kinds of whinstone ; whole 
rocks of which have been blown down and carried away to form

the breakwater at the harbour. On the west side of the baths, 
within high water-mark, there are several strata of excellent 
ironstone, from two inches to nearly five feet in thickness ; but 
which lying on their edge could not be wrought but at very great 
expense. These strata are separated from one- another by slate. 
Several specimens of pyrites have also been found in this neigh- 
bourhood, but they are rare. 

Geology. — There are many appearances that lead us to conclude 
that a considerable portion of the lower grounds of this parish were, 
at a period not extremely distant, under the dominion of the sea. 
Sub-fossil sea-shells, such as are at present found on the shore, 
have been found in gravel pits, and in the earthy banks of Stanley 
Burn, as far up as Kirkhall. They have also been found in a sec- 
tion of the Castlehill, pretty near the summit. The greatest mass, 
however, of these shells that we have seen, is in the sandy bank of 
this burn, a little above the railway bridge, and near the Holm 
Nursery. In a section of the bank, about 4 feet above the level of 
the stream, and about 6 feet above the present level of the sea at 
high-water, there is a pretty extensive stratum of shells, about 2 
feet under the surface of the ground, at some places above, and at 
other places below, a bed of sand and water-worn stones. The 
predominant shell is Mactra sichtruncata. We observed also Turho 
littoreus, Nerita littoralis, Trochus cinerarius, Mytilus edulis, and 
Tellina tenuis. Some of the Mactrce were filled with sea-weed, 
but we could not with certainty determine the species. In one of 
the shells we found a specimen of coralline, which could easily be 
ascertained to be Sertularia polyzonias. From the various pheno- 
mena that present themselves, we have no doubt that the Castlehill 
at Ardrossan was once an island. That the water has receded 
along this shore there can be no doubt. At the Castlehill, above 
noticed, there is still pointed out a spot at which boats were fasten- 
ed to the rock. This spot is now distant from the water at high 
mark about 400 yards. Pont, the topographer of Cuninghame, 
who wrote circa 1620, speaks of a well in the castle that ebbed 
and flowed with the tide. He has also the following notice : " Nette 
lyle is a small lyland neir ye Castell of Ardrossan, quher ye Earle 
of Eglintoune hath a salmond fisching by netts, from which ye lyland 
is so named." So far has the water receded, that the piece of 
ground here alluded to the Inch never appears as an island ex- 
cept at high water ; and it is not at all known by its former name.

in 1832, between 4 and 7 feet below the surface, there were dug up 
a ffreat nunaber of hazel nuts with the kernels entire, but so tender 
as scarcely to bear being handled. 

Soil — Between the sea and the foot of the hills the soil is in ge- 
neral light and sandy, and in the higher and more inland parts, it 
is chiefly of a tough clay, though in many places mixed with a bet- 
ter kind of earth. Throughout the whole parish, the soil may be 
said to be fertile ; rendered so by long cultivation, and in the lower 
parts by the copious appHcation of sea-ware, and in the higher, by 
draining and the free use of lime. 

Zoology. — Much attention is paid to the breed both of horses 
and cows, especially of the latter. The Cuninghame breed of 
cows is well known, and highly valued, both on account of the 
beauty of their form, and the quantity of milk which they yield. 
The Cuninghame or Ayrshire cow is of a moderate size, generally 
of a brown colour, mixed with white spots; the neck and head small; 
the horns short ; the limbs slender ; the udder finely shaped ; the 
body straight from the shoulder to the tail, and all the parts well 
proportioned. "When and by whom this breed of cows was intro- 
duced into the country, or from what place they were brought, are 
questions which have never received a satisfactory answer. About 
eighteen years ago, a peculiar race of cows was kept in Lord Eghn- 
ton's parks at Ardrossan. They had no horns, were all white, with the 
exception of the muzzle and inside of the ears, which were black. 
When fully grown they weighed from twenty-five to thirty stones 
avoirdupois. Their number was limited, and being very shy, they 
had to be killed by shooting, which it required some precaution to 
accomphsh. At his Lordship's death they were all sold off, and with 
them, according to some, perished the last remains of the breed of 
the ancient cows of Scotland. Besides the horses employed in 
husbandry, a few are bred for sale ; many young cattle reared, and 
cows fattened for slaughter. Some of the farmers keep a few sheep, 
and almost all of them pigs, which in summer are fed with whey, of 
which those who make cheese have a greater quantity than they 
can either sell or use in their own families. Sea-birds of almost 
every name frequent the coast, and many of them lay their eggs 
and hatch their young on the Horse Isle. The rocks along the 
shore towards the north of Ardrossan are much frequented by 
seals. Otters are found in the Stanley and Caddel Burns, and Caafi 
Polecats are no strangers, and the badger may sometimes be seen 
in Monfode bank. There is a large fox cover on Knock-georgan.

The weasel, hedgehog, mole, and rat are found. Hares and par- 
tridges abound, and grouse and black-cock are tolerably abundant 
in Busby Moor. Pheasants, wood-pigeons, wild-duck, teal, and 
lapwing, are also found. The cuckoo, land-rail, and the swallow, 
annually visit the parish. The starling and swift build in the ruins 
of Ardrossan Castle. Fish of the following species are caught on the 
coast: salmon, haddock, cod, whiting, ling, mackarel, herrings, 
sole, flounder, skate, turbot, mullet, &amp;c.— Crabs and lobsters are 
also found. The quantity of shell-fish is but small.

11. — Civil History. 
Of the ancient history of this parish hardly any thing worth 
notice is known. A modern account of it was published by Mr 
Robertson of Bowerlodge, in 1819, in his description of Cuning- 
hame. 

Eminent Men. — Of eminent men connected with the parish there 
is no record, unless Dr Robert Simpson, the celebrated Professor 
of Mathematics in the University of Glasgow, be excepted. The 
professor was an heritor in the parish, and passed the recess of col- 
lege for many years on his own property at Knockewart.

Parochial Registers. — From a memorandum in one of the vo- 
lumes, of date 1755, it appears that registers of baptisms, from 
May 28, 1682 till May 23, 1725, had been regularly kept, but 
which have long been lost. From 1742 till 1787, lists of baptisms 
and marriages have been regularly kept, and with a little interrup- 
tion at this period till 1802, — from which last date till 1816 they 
are very imperfect ; but they have since been kept with great ac- 
curacy. 

Antiquities. — Only a very imperfect account can be given of any 
remains of antiquity that are yet to be seen in the parish. The di- 
lapidated remains of the Castle of Ardrossan, a venerable monu- 
ment of time long gone by, stand qn the small promontoryfabove- 
mentioned, which gives name to the parish. It is said that this 
castle, in the days of Baliol, being in the hands of the English, 
Wallace, with some trusty followers, came secretly to the neigh- 
bourhood, and set fire, at night, to the village at the base of the 
Castle-hill. The garrison seeing the flames, and not suspecting 
the enemy to be at hand, hurried forth to quench the fire, when 
Wallace and his chosen band rushed in, and having taken posses- 
sion of the gates, slew all the English as they returned, and cast 
their dead bodies into the dungeon, which, from that circumstance, 
was called Wallace's Larder. This once princely mansion is 
said to have been habitable so late as the time of Oliver Cromwell, 
who is reported to have reduced it to its present ruinous state. In 
the former Statistical Account of this parish, it is said that " he 
threw down the walls of the castle, carried the stones over sea in 
boats, and with them built the fort of Ayr." Two fragments are 
now all that remain. The castle and barony of Ardrossan an- 
ciently belonged to a powerful family of the same name, according 
to some, or Barclay, according to others ; f perhaps to both at 

 In making a cut, close by the south side of the castle, for the railway in 1829, 
a large massy gilt bronze ring, with signet, was found, and which, from the 
letter W on it, is supposed to have belonged to this noble assertor of his country's 
independence. The ring is now in the possession of the Rev. David Landsborough 
of Stevenston. 

f The first of this family, says Robertson, that has come under my notice is, Dom. 
Fergus Ardrossan de eodem, in 1260. A Sir Fergus de Ardrossan accompanied 
Edward Bruce in his Irish expedition in 1316. The last of them mentioned in any 
record that I have seen is Godfrey de Ardrossun, who is witness to an undated charter 

in the reign of David II. to the Abbot of Kilwinning Hist, of Cuninghame. 

Fergus of Ardrossan was one of the Scots'barons who, in 1320, signed the celebrat- 
ed letter to the Pope, complaining of the aggressions and pretensions of Edward of 
England. Arthurus de Ardrossan is witness to a charter H ugeni dc Crawford de 
terris de Monach, in 1226.

different times. The last baron leaving at his death an only sister, 

or an only child, a daughter, she carried the estate by marriage 

to the Eglintons of Englinton, from whence it came soon after to 

the Montgomery family, by marriage of the heiress of Eglinton, i 

Since the union of these two families by this marriage, the estate 

has continued for several centuries the property of the Earls of 

Eglinton. 

On the estate of Monfode, or Montfode, as it is now written, 
there stands an old baronial castle, much injured by time and the 
hand of man. The estate of Monfode continued for many ao-es 
the property of a family of the same name ; but it passed from 
them about a century and a half ago, and no vestige now remains 
to tell that they once existed.  It at present belongs to Mr Carrick 
Moore, of Corsewall, brother of the lamented General Sir John 
Moore, who so bravely fell at Corunna. 

On Knock-georgan are still distinctly to be seen the remains of 
an ancient camp or fortification, particularly the ramparts and 
gateways. From its circular form it is generally supposed to be 
Danish. On another hill there is an artificial mound of the form 
of a parallelogram, sixteen yards in length, nine in breadth at the 

I top ; and its sides, which are sloping, about nine yards in height. 

I The above fortification and mound stand in very elevated situa- 

tions, from which there is a prospect for many miles both of sea 
and land. Tradition has preserved no information concerning the  
persons by whom, or the design for which, they were erected. - 

Modern Buildings. — Of modern buildings may be mentioned, 
1. The town-house of Saltcoats, a moderately sized building of 
two stories, with a handsome spire, clock, and bell. It contains 

f one spacious room, which is used as a reading-room, and for the 

monthly meetings of the Justice of the Peace Court for the dis- 
trict. There are, besides a small lock-up, a room for the town 
library, and a committee room. The ground floor is occupied with 
shops. 2. A branch of the Ayrshire Banking Company has with- 
in these few years been established in Saltcoats, with excellent 
new premises. 3. The Gaelic chapel, now finished, situated at the I 
west end of the town of Saltcoats, facing Ardrossan. It is a neat 

 Agnes de Monfode, says Robertson, was married to a Sir John Douglas iii the 
reign of David II. This is the earliest notice that I have seen of them. In 1417, 
Finlam de Monfode dc eodem appears on an inquest at Irvine. The last time that 
any of them is found in any record that I have seen is in 1661, when John de Mon- 
fode of Monfode is named among the commissioners of supply for the shire of Ayr.

small Gothic building, with Saxon door-way, small belfry— and the

III. — Population. 
The state of the population of this parish at an early period can- 
not be given with certainty, as no record of it has been kept ; but 
there is satisfactory evidence to shew that it has tripled within less 
than a century : — 

Population in 1791, - 1518 
1811, - 2526 
1821, - 3200 
1831, - 3595 inclusive of seamen. 

The constant employment given for many years to a great many 
hands at the harbour of Ardrossan, — of late years in the formation 
of the railway, — the great increase of trade by an additional harbour 
within a mile of Saltcoats, — the improved state of agriculture, — 
many families from Ireland and the Highlands settling in the place, — 
and a few unconnected with business, from partiality to the situa- 
tion, either renting houses or building for themselves, — may be sup- 
posed to account for the increase of the population.

Character, Sc. of the People. — In 1650, various cases of witch- 
craft occurred in this parish, as appears from the records of the 
Presbytery of Irvine. Among others, Margaret Couper and Ka- 
tharine Montgomerie, both of Saltcoats, were apprehended on pre- 
sumption of this crime, and on what was the chief evidence in such 
matters, " common bruit." They confessed the usual charges of 
renouncing their baptism, taking a new name from the devil, of 
having familiar intercourse with him, and of " sundrie malefices, 
and drawing on of others to the devil's service." So late as 1735, 
a man and his wife in this parish were laid under sentence of lesser 
excommunication, for consulting, a fortune-teller at Paisley, to find 
out the person who had stolen their money. These crimes and 
customs have now disappeared. Would we could add, that there 
was an equal decrease of all other crimes. But though we have cer.

tainly too many among us who have cast off all fear of God, and 
yield themselves up to the practice of wickedness in some of its 
most degrading forms, yet the people in general are sober and in- 
dustrious, and distinguished for a regard to religion and its ordi- 
nances. Not only is the form of godliness kept up, but its power 
appears to be felt, by not a few among them maintaining a conver- 
sation becoming the gospel. 

The illegitimate births for the last three years do not average 
more than one yearly. There are, however, many children be- 
gotten previous to the marriage of the parties. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agricultural and Rural Economy. — The parish contains about 
5520 Scots acres, of which there are 

at an average under crop, . 1250 

in cultivated grass lands and meadows, '2320 

in gardens and plantations, . . 130 

in hill pasture, . 1800 

Rent of Land, 8fc. — The valued rent of the parish is L. 2840, 
16s. lOd. Scotch. Its real rent is about L. 7800 Sterling'. The 
average rent of land is L. 1, 10s. per acre. The duration of leases 
is from twelve to nineteen years. The lands are all enclosed ; the 
farms skilfully managed. The steadings are almost all slated, and 
are comfortable and commodious. 

Fisheries. — Salmon are taken both at Ardrossan and Saltcoats, 
in considerable numbers, in what is called the bag-net, and are 
mostly forwarded, per coach, to the Glasgow, Paisley, and Kilmar- 
nock markets, and sometimes to Liverpool. The white-6shing is 
carried on to a very trifling extent, but there are from fifteen to 
twenty boats regularly employed in the herring-fishing. The lochs 
in the West and North Highlands are their principal fishing 
grounds, though herrings are frequently caught in considerable 
numbers in Saltcoats bay. Some of our boats go to the cod and 
ling fishing on the coasts of Barra and other islands, and are ge- 
nerally well repaid for their toil and risk. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Oats, - 3365 quarters. 

Wheat, - - 671 do. 

Potatoes and turnips, 1897 tons. 

Cultivated hay, - 692 do. 

Meadow hay, - 1.30 do. 

Cheese, - 10,000 stones. 

Stock. — Number of horses and cattle in the parish for year 1836: 
horses, 131 ; milk cows, 675; cattle, 570; and sheep, 184. 

• There are two or three large families of unbaptised biistards in tlic parish.

Agricultural Society. — A society, embracing nine contiguous 
parishes, formed with the view of giving encouragement to the 
raising of live-stock and other agricultural produce, holds its meet- 
ings in this parish. It is chiefly supported by the farmers. Lord 
Eglinton is patron, and several of the county gentlemen are mem- 
bers of it. Its annual meeting is held on the fourth Thursday of 
November, when premiums are awarded to successful competitors 
for stock, farm and dairy produce. Premiums are also given for 
the best managed farms, and the most neatly kept courts and en- 
trances about the steadings. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

In this parish there are two sea ports, Saltcoats and Ardrossan. 

Saltcoats. — Saltcoats stands partly in the parish of Stevenston, 
and partly in this parish. The harbour is in the Stevenston part 
of Saltcoats. The town contains about 4000 inhabitants, of whom 
nearly two-thirds belong to this parish. The population consists 
chiefly of sailors and weavers, shopkeepers, joiners, masons, black- 
smiths, &amp;c. The weavers, who form a large proportion of the in- 
habitants, there are upwards of 450 looms in the Ardrossan side 
of Saltcoats, are chiefly employed by the manufacturers of Glas- 
gow and Paisley. The kind of work done is lappets, gauzes, 
shawls, trimmings, silks, &amp;c. Many families are employed in sew- 
ing muslin. 

Ardrossan. — Ardrossan, which may be said to be the capital of 
the parish, owes its origin to its harbour, and is yet only in its in- 
fancy. It is built on a regular plan, and, when completed, will do 
honour to the taste and judgment of the projector, the late Hugh 
Earl of Eglinton. The streets are wide, straight, and cross at right 
angles. The houses are all of two storeys, well finished, neat and 
comfortable. There are several very excellent houses built for sea- 
bathing quarters, and which afford very genteel and commodious 
lodgings. There are a few good shops which supply the necessa- 
ries and conveniences of life, and sea-chandlery on a small scale. 
Ardrossan has hitherto been well frequented as a sea-bathing place. 
Ship-building on a small scale, is carried on, by an active and en- 
terprising man, a Mr Henderson, who has hitherto found it to be 
no unprofitable speculation. The town of Ardrossan is a place of 

 The late Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, the Earl of Glasgow, the 
Lord Justice-Clerk, the late Sir Alexander Muir Mackenzie, of Delvine, Lady 
Olivia Sparrow, Lord and Lady Mandeville, and sevei-al oiher families of distinction, 
have spent the summer at Ardrossan for the benefit of sea-bathing.

such rising importance as to merit a somewhat lengthened and par- 
ticular account. 

Jnn. — The inn or hotel, one of the best in any country town in 
Scotland, affords every accommodation which can be required. It 
contains ten public rooms, and eighteen bed-rooms, with cold and 
warm baths. The offices, too, are excellent and extensive. 

Baths. — The baths of Ardrossan, — a large and somewhat elegant 
building, — are well known, and deservedly in repute. They were 
projected by the late Earl, on the tontine principle, in the year 
1807. For many years after his Lordship's death they were shut 
up, and the premises allowed to fall into a state of decay. In the 
year 1833, they were brought to a public sale, and purchased by 
A. Macfadzean, Esq., M. D., the present proprietor, who has at 
considerable expense put them again into a complete state of re- 
pair. The basins are all of marble, with dressing-rooms attach- 
ed to each. There is one fitted up expressly for the poor, which 
is open to them gratis. There may now be got almost at a moment's 
notice, hot, cold, shower, shock, and vapour baths. Attached to 
the baths, there is a large and commodious lodging, which is ge- 
nerally occupied during the bathing season. 

Crescent. — Around the fine sweeping bay which the sea forms 
between Ardrossan and Saltcoats, there is a plan of a crescent 
formed, which, when filled up, will be unequalled, both for beauty 
of situation, and magnificence of design. A number of very hand- 
some villas, uniform in line, but varied in style, have already been 
erected, and are generally occupied by their respective proprietors. 
The pavilion, a very handsome building, is the occasional residence 
of Lord Eglinton. 

Harbour. — The harbour of Ardrossan is formed on a most mag- 
nificent design, and were it to be completed according to the ori- 
ginal plan, would scarcely be inferior to any in the kingdom. 
It was originally projected by Lord Eglinton, who was joined in 
carrying it into execution by several gentlemen of Ayrshire, and 
other places, taking shares in the undertaking. The expense of 
the work, however, far exceeding the sum subscribed by the share- 
holders, the whole subsequent expense devolved upon his Lordship, 
to the amount, it is said, of little less than L. 100,000. The 
work was carried on with great spirit by tlie Earl as long as he 
lived, but has been suspended since his death. The harbour, 
though unfinished, is capable of accommodating at present a great 
number of vessels of almost any size; there being from 12 to 



ARDROSSAN. 



203 



20 feet of depth at high water. It is secure against almost all winds, 
— the roll of the sea in a storm is very inconsiderable; and in rough 
weather it is frequently crowded with vessels, which flee thither 
for safety. Its situation is the most favourable on the whole frith, 
both for inland purposes and foreign intercourse. Vessels in the 
coal trade, both from Irvine and Saltcoats, often come to Ardros- 
san to complete their cargo, where they can be fully loaded at any 
state of the tide. The number of arrivals, including steamers, at 
this quay, for the year ending 1st of January last, is as follows : 

Number of vessels, - - - 1963 

Amount of tonnage, - - . 108,549 

Number of hands employed, men and boys, 10,110 

Life-boat. — Belonging to the harbour there is an excellent life- 
boat, the gift of the late Earl, which has successfully been employ - 
ed several times within these few years, in rescuing seamen from the 
wrecks of their vessels on the Stevenston shore. 

Railway. — In forming the harbour of Ardrossan, Lord Eglin- 
ton entertained the firm belief, that, from its advantageous posi- 
tion, it would one day become the harbour of Glasgow, and there- 
by render unnecessary the circuitous navigation of the Clyde. To 
carry this design into execution, to unite the harbour and the town 
of Glasgow, a canal was projected, but was never finished further 
than from Glasgow to Johnstone, in Renfrewshire. In 1827, an 
act of Parliament was obtained to form a railway from Ardrossan to 
join the canal at Johnstone. The capital raised, however, was only 
sufficient to complete a single lineof railway to Kilwinning, a distance 
of six miles inland, with a branch of about four miles in length into 
the Eglinton coal-fields. It was opened in 1832. For two years after- 
wards, there was comparatively little trade on it; but in 1834, the 
present Earl of Eglinton having opened up several additional coal 
pits, the shipping of coal at Ardrossan was begun, and has since been 
carried on with great spirit. It is believed that the gross tonnage 
carried along the railway during last year, 1836, was not less 
than 60,000 tons. About the same time, 1834, a carriage for 
the conveyance of passengers between Ardrossan and Irvine, and 
the intermediate towns on the line, was started ; but such was the 
uncertainty of its succeeding by running at regular hours, that it 
was kept to be hired for pleasure trips. The Railway Companj, 
however, took the business into their own hands, and ran at fixed 
and regular hours ; since which time, the trade in that department 
has regularly increased. The number of passengers for the three 
last years is as follows :

The majority of the travellers by the railway are of the middle 
and lower classes, to meet whose convenience the fares are at the 
very lowest remunerating rate, being only one -penny per mile. 
In consequence of the great increase, both of goods and passen- 
gers, a single line is found to be insufficient to afford the necessary 
accommodation. To remedy this the company have applied to 
Parliament for an act, to enable them to raise funds to lay a double 
line of railway, and to adopt locomotive power thereupon. There 
is now every probability that the great Glasgow and Ayr railway 
will go on; an excellent junction between which and the Ardrossan 
railway will be effected, at a trifling expense, at Kilwinning — and 
thus the communication between Ardrossan and Glasgow be com- 
pleted. Were this accomplished it could not fail to prove a great 
public benefit. The projected line passes through a large tract 
of country rich in the most valuable minerals, and containing se- 
veral large and populous villages. The whole of the manufactur- 
ing and shipping towns in the west of Scotland would thereby be 
brought into immediate connection with Paisley and Glasgow, and 
perhaps ultimately, if the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway be car- 
ried through, with Edinburgh ; and thus a direct communication 
be opened up between the two seas. The advantages of this great 
line of railway are fully set forth in the Mining, Railway, and Steam 
Navigation Gazette of the 31st December last, from which the fol- 
lowing extract is made : " The position which this harbour of 
Ardrossan occupies is very favourable, being situated at the 
mouth of the Clyde, and within thirty miles by railway of Glasgow. 
Parties requiring to travel from Glasgow or Edinburgh, and the 
north of Ireland or Liverpool, when this railway is executed, will 
be able to accomplish the journey in at least eight hours and a-half 
from Edinburgh, and five hours from Glasgow, less time than what 
is required in sailing at present from Ardrossan to Belfast. In most 
instances a night passage will be avoided. The time required to pro- 
ceed at present from Glasgow to Belfastby water conveyance, is from 
fourteen to fifteen hours, while from Edinburgh at least twenty hours 
are required. The passage from Ardrossan to Belfast is from six to 
six and a-half hours, so that tlie whole time required to travel from 
Edinburgh and Glasgow to Belfast would not exceed seven and a- 
half hours from Glasgow, and nine and a-half from Edinburgh. Ar- 
drossan is one of the most fashionable watering-places on the west

coast of Scotland, and would be rendered by a railway the nearest 
and most accessible." 

Means of Communication. — 1. Saltcoats is a post-town, to 
which Ardrossan is a penny-post. The mail, conveyed on horse- 
back from Kilmarnock, arrives every morning at half-past eight 
o'clock, and departs at four o'clock afternoon. There is a daily 
runner to and from Kilbride. Packets twice a week during winter, 
and every lawful day in summer, carry the letter-bag to and from 
Arran. 2. There are coaches every lawful day to and from Glas- 
gow, by Paisley and Beith, and to and from Kilmarnock by Irvine. 
In summer there are two more daily coaches, one from Glasgow 
and another from Kilmarnock. 3. Steam-boats every lawful day 
to and from Glasgow and Ayr, and the intermediate ports, and once 
a week to and from Stranraer. In summer there is a steamer 
which plies regularly betwixt Ardrossan and Arran, leaving Ar- 
drossan on the arrival of the morning coaches from Glasgow and 
Kilmarnock at about half-past ten o'clock, and returning in time 
for the starting of the same coaches at about half-past six o'clock 
in the evening. Thus a person may leave Glasgow or Kilmarnock 
in the morning, visit Arran, spend some hours amidst its wildest 
scenery, enjoy a view from the frith of the whole western coast, 
and sleep in his own house at night. The passengers last year 
to and from Arran during the summer months were nearly 7000 
monthly.-f- 4. Carriers twice a week to Glasgow, to Kilmai'nock 
and Beith weekly, and to Irvine two daily. 5. The railway convey- 
ances have been noticed above. As soon as a railway has been opened 
up either to Glasgow or Kilmarnock, and locomotive power employ- 
ed thereon, it is in contemplation to start a steamer from Ardros- 
san to Belfast, for which there is a large sum already subscribed. 

Roads. — The turnpike road from Irvine to Greenock passes 
through the whole breadth of the parish, along the shore. There 
are also two tolerably well-kept roads, one from Ardrossan, and 
the other from Saltcoats to Dairy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated in the town 
of Saltcoats, and is convenient for the majority of the parishioners, 
though too distant for many. It was built in the year 1774, and 
is seated for about 840. There, is something curious in the pe- 
regrinations and mischances of the churches of this parish. The 

• By some alterations taking place in the post-office department, we have at pre- 
sent two arrivals and two departures daily. 

t Owing, it is supposed, to the depressed state of commerce this summer, these 
coaches have not been running.

church originally stood on the Castlehill of Ardrossan, where its 
foundations may still be traced, and where may be seen the old 
churchyard, in which sleeps many a generation now forgotten and 
unknown. This church was blown down by a violent storm of 
wind in the year 1691, when another was built about half a 
mile more inland, and in a more sheltered situation. About the 
year 1744 this church was taken down and removed to Saltcoats, 
where the present one now stands. In February 1773, Mr Dow, 
the then minister of the parish, reported to the presbytery, " that 
the church of Ardrossan had been so much shaken by the storm 
upon the 20th of last month, that the parishioners ever since had 
assembled in it with terror." It was eventually ordered to be taken 
down, and was rebuilt in 1774, with the slight alterations of fourteen 
feet only being taken off the length of it, and the removal of the 
front aisle. There is great need of the present church being 
enlarged; or, what would still be more desirable, a new church 
built in Ardrossan, and that town, with a section of the landward 
part of the parish most convenient to it, erected into a separate 
parish. 

It may not perhaps be out of place here to give a list of the 
ministers of this parish, so far as is known. 

1. The earliest reformed minister of the parish of whom any no- 
tice has been found is named in a letter of Regent Murray's to 
the General Assembly of 1569. The Regent says, " Mairover 
at our coming, at Aberdeen, there came ane named Porterfield, 
minister, provydit of before to the viccarage of Ardrossane, and 
required also of us that he micht have the viccarage of Stein- 
sone, seeing both was ane matter meine aneuch to sustaine him, 
and because the kirks war neir, he micht discharge the cure of 
both." Two years prior to this it appears that Alexander Hen- 
derson was exhorter at Ardrossan, at 40 merks of salary. He 
was " translatit" to Stewarton, and was succeeded by William 
Montgomery. 2. Alexander Campbell, rector of Ardrossan, is 
witness to a sasine, penes Robert Cuninghame of Auchinharvie 
in 1593. 3. Alexander Dunlop was deposed in 1646, and suc- 
ceeded in the year following by, 4. Ralph Roger, who was trans- 
lated, and succeeded by, 5. John Bell, who was one of the indul- 
ged ministers. On 26th January 1671, the privy-council made 
an act confining all indulged ministers to their respective parishes. 
Wodrow states, that " Mr John Bell, minister at Ardrossan, being 
confined to his parish, his father living within a mile of him, falls

sick, and he must apply to the council to visit his dying father. 
They allow him, indeed, by their act, 22d June 1671, but with 
a proviso, that he go to no other house without his parish in com- 
ing and going." For want of encouragement, both as to mainte- 
nance and meeting-house, Mr Bell demitted his charge in 1688. 
6. Thomas Clerk was ordained in 1691, and died in 1737. 7. Ro- 
bert Dow was ordained in 1739, and died in 1787. 8. John Duncan 
was ordained in 1789, and died in 1819. 9. John Hendry was or- 
dained assistant and successor to Mr Duncan in 1810, and died in 
1835 ; and, 10. The present incumbent was ordained assistant and 
successor to Mr Hendry in July 1830; so that it may be said the pa- 
rish has been vacant only three times since the Revolution of 1688. 

Manse, Sc. — The manse and offices were built upwards of forty 
years ago. In 1835, the manse was considerably enlarged and 
thoroughly repaired. The glebe, including garden and site of 
manse and offices, consists of 5 acres 1 rood. The soil is 
good, and, from its nearness to the town of Saltcoats, might be let 
at between L. 4 and L. 5 per acre. There are L. 20 Scots allow- 
ed in lieu of a grass glebe, according to an agreement entered into 
between the presbytery and the heritors, nearly a century ago, 
though it is on record there was abundance of church lands in 
the parish. The present stipend is 17 chalders, half meal and 
half barley, with L. 10 for communion elements. 

Gaelic Church. — This church was built by subscription ; cost 
neai'ly L. 1000 ; and contains 720 legal sittings. It is also situated 
in the town of Saltcoats, where the majority of the Highland fa- 
milies are located. There is no minister appointed as yet. A 
stipend of L. 80 will be secured in the usual manner, and paid from 
the seat-rents and collections. 

Dissenters. — -There is one dissenting house in the parish, be- 
longing to the United Secession. The minister has a house and 
garden. His stipend is paid from the seat-rents and collections. 

The parish church is always well attended. The seats are let 

 By a grant of the heritors in 1747, the minister has the privilege of gathering 
and leading of sea wrack, for improving the new glebe, from any part of the shore 
betwixt the Stanley Burn foot and the harbour of Saltcoats. From the following ex- 
tract from the presbytery records, it appears that at one time he had some other sea 
privileges. May 1 8th 1 647. " J'he edict of Mr Ralph Roger being called for, was 
returned formallie and lawfullie indorseit :— the presentation being producit and 
compairit with the prior presentation, it was fund to be deficient in ane clause anent 
the aea viccarage, whilk it did not specific at all, but which the prcsbyterie was con- 
fident that the two noblemen Eglintonc and Montgomerie would rectifie — the 
presbyteric being hopfuU, that the said two noblemen would mend any thing that was 
deficient in the presentation ; ordaines the admissione," &amp;c.

by public roup. A few free sittings are reserved for the poor. The 
number of communicants on the roll at present is 835 ; and the 
average number communicating at each dispensation of the Lord's 
supper is about 654. Precise ecclesiastical state, as reported to 
the Church Commissioners, November 1836 : belonging to the Es- 
tablishment, 2170; belonging to Dissenters of all denominations, 
1223; not known to belong to any stated place of worship, 441 ; 
total population, 3834. 

Religious Societies. — The Saltcoats Female Bible and Mission- 
ary Society has existed above twenty years, and still continues to 
exert itself with much zeal. It contributes to the funds of diffe- 
rent religious societies. Its annual income since 1813 averages 
L.38. 

Ardrossan and Stevenston Parochial Society. — This society was 
established in the spring of 1833, and is supported wholly by the 
contributions of people belonging to the Established Church. Its 
object is to supply the poor with Bibles at a cheap rate, or gratis, 
and to educate the children of widows and tradesmen in reduced 
circumstances. The average yearly expenditure is L. 23, 6s. 8d. 
and the average number of children on its list at school is about 
35 quarterly. 

The average yearly amount of extra collections for religious and 
charitable objects is between L. 40 and L. 50. 

Education.— Theve are nine schools in the parish. Six, includ- 
ing the parish school, in Saltcoats ; two in Ardrossan ; and one 
in the country. The parish school is too small, and the situation 
confined and unhealthy. The heritors, however, have agreed to 
build a new one, greatly enlarged, and on a more eligible site. 
There is also a large and commodious school-house now bemg 
built in the town of Ardrossan, at the cost of L. 335; the money 
has been raised by subscription. Government contributing L. 150. 
The parish schoolmaster's salary is If chalders. The average 
amount of fees about L.25; and the amount of other emoluments 
about L. 15. The school fees are, 3s. for reading; 3s. 9d. for 
reading and writing; 4s. 6d. for arithmetic; 6s. for Greek and La- 
tin per quarter; 10s. 6d. for one course of book-keeping; and 
L. 1, Is. for navigation. There is much need for a good school- 
house with a small endowment for the country part of the parish. 

Literature.— n-ieve is a subscription library in the town of Sa t- 
coats, consisting of a good many wel selected works, to which sub- 
scribers only have access. The terms, however, are very mode-

rate. There are also the Saltcoats Sabbath School Library ; the 
Ardrossan Sabbath School Library; and the Parochial Juvenile 
Library ; into which books adapted to the young are principally 
introduced. There is a public reading-room in the town-house of 
Saltcoats. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — A savings bank was establish- 
ed in Saltcoats about twenty years ago, which has certainly been 
productive of much good. The number of depositors is 148, viz. 
62 males, 62 females, 11 small charitable societies, and 13 indi- 
viduals beyond the bounds of Ardrossan and Stevenston. The 
sum at present deposited is L. 777, 17s. 5d., giving an average of 
above L. 5, 5s. to each depositor. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the roll 
is above 70, and they receive from 6d. to 3s. weekly, according 
to their necessities. They are supported at an expense of nearly 
L. 170 a-year, obtained from the collections at the church door; 
mortcloth and proclamation money'; and a voluntary contribution 
by the heritors. The collections amount to about L. 80 a-year; 
the mortcloth and proclamation money to about L. 20 ; and the 
sum further required is contributed by the heritors according to 
their valuation. There is, besides. Service's Bequest of L. 300 ; 
the interest of which is distributed by the trustees, the minister, 
the oldest surgeon, and nearest resident justice of the peace, among 
poor householders in the parish. There is little backwardness in 
applying for relief from the parish funds. They do not look upon 
this kind of charity as in any way degrading ; and children in good 
circumstances have been known to allow their parents to receive it. 

Fairs. — -There are three fairs held in this parish in the course 
of the year ; one in Saltcoats on the last Thursday of May, for 
cattle, pigs, shoes, cooper-dishes, &amp;c. ; the other two in Ardrossan ; 
one of them in July, and the other on the fourth Thursday of No- 
vember, for cattle and settling of accounts. 

Inns, Alehouses, 8fc. — There are 28 houses or shops in the pa- 
rish licensed to sell ardent spirits and ales ; and the fact cannot be 
denied that they have a most pernicious effect upon the morals of 
the people.  

 About 7000 gallons of spirits have been returned me, as entered in the excise 
books, for one year alone, the price of which to the consumer must be above L. 3500, 
—a sum sufficient to keep all the poor in the parish in most comfortable circumstan- 
ces, — pay the ministers of religion and the teachers of youth handsomely, besides 
maintaining an efficient police. Mucii of this quantity may be used as sea-store • 
still, however, the quantity consumed ashore must be very great ; and vice and mt-

bouring parishes of Stevenston and Kilwinning, is the only fuel 
used throughout the parish.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. THOMAS JOHNSTONE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The ancient name of the parish appears to have been 
indiscriminately written Dairy, Dalray, and Dalrye. The mo- 
dern name is Dairy. It is evidently derived from the Gaelic 
" Dail," a plain or valley, and " Righ," a king, signifying " King's 
plain" or " King's valley" — a considerable portion of the parish 
being in the valley of Garnock. In ancient times, it is believed 
that not only the district of Carrick, but also a part of Cunning- 
hame, was comprehended in the province or lordship of Galloway. 
A part, however, was under the royal jurisdiction, and bore the 
designation of the King's District, hence the name of King's Val- 
ley was derived. A field, on part of which the village is built, still 
bears the name of Croftangry, doubtless a corruption of Croftanrigh, 
or croft of the King. 

Extent — Boundaries. — The parish extends in length, from north 
to south, 10 miles, and varies from 3 to 8 miles in breadth from 
east to west, and contains 29 square miles. It is bounded on the 
east by the parish of Beith ; on the south and south-west, by the 
parishes of Kilwinning and Ardrossan ; on the west and north- 
west, by the parishes of West Kilbride and Largs ; and on the 
north and north-east, by the parish of Kilbirnie. The figure of 
the parish is very irregular, being narrowest at the middle. A 
stripe of hilly ground juts out from its northern side, about 3 miles 
in length, by 1 to 2 in breadth. A portion of the parish at this 

sery, the necessary consequence of indulgence, arc not wanting to attest the fearful 
extent of this most baneful and demoralizing habit. 

 The following Account was drawn up by Mr Thomas Hogg, Junior, Tofts-Mill, 
Dairy.

extremity, containing about 1500 acres, is nearly dissevered from 
the rest by the parish of Largs. 

Topographical Appearances. — The principal feature of the pa- 
rish is a beautiful and fertile valley, which stretches through its 
middle and breadth, and varies from half a mile to a mile in width. 
Its elevation does not exceed 90 feet above the sea. The river 
Garnock flows through the valley in a winding course, and di- 
vides the parish into two divisions. On the west, the ground 
rises gradually from the valley, till it terminates on a ridge of hills 
on the north-west boundary of the parish. These hills, com- 
mencing at the coast at Largs, run in a south-east direction, in 
two parallel ranges for several miles. The eastern, which com- 
prises the hilly stripe formerly mentioned, bends to the east, and 
joins the Kilbirnie hills. Its highest elevation is about 1200 
feet above the sea. The western range, on its entrance into this 
parish, bends to the south-west, and terminates at the extremity 
of the parish. Baidland Hill, its highest point, is 946 feet above 
the sea. A small ridge of hilly ground runs to the south of this, 
the highest eminence of which, Caerwinning Hill, is 634 feet in 
height. 

Cave. — On the estate of Blair, in the romantic and beautifully 
wooded glen of the Dusk, there is a natural cave in a precipitous 
bank of limestone. It is about 40 feet above the bed of the stream, 
and is covered by about 30 feet of rock and earth. It has two 
entrances. The western or main entrance is situated below a vast 
overhanging rock, 30 feet long by 27 in breadth, the brow of which 
is covered by the mountain-ash, hazel, and two large plane trees, 
which give it a picturesque appearance. Its interior resembles 
Gothic arched work. Part of the roof is supported by two massy 
columns. Its length is about 183 feet, and breadth from 5 to 12. 
Near the middle, it expands into a spacious chamber, 35 feet long 
by 12 broad, and 12 high. Its internal surface is covered by cal- 
careous incrustations, and numerous crevices branch off from its 
sides. In former times, popular behef peopled it with elves. It 
consequently acquired the name of Elf-House. In later days, 
during the tyrannical reign of Charles II., it afforded a hiding-place 
to the Covenanters of this parish from the violence of their infu- 
riated persecutors. 

Climate. — The prevailing winds are from the W. and S. W., 
from which point it blows for nearly three-fourths of the year. 
These winds are sometimes strong and violent. During a few 



212 



AYllSHIRE. 



weeks in spring, a cold withering easterly wind prevails, which, being 
often accompanied by frost, proves very detrimental to vegetation. 
From its proximity to the Atlantic, the climate is moist, — the rains 
are frequent, heavy, and long-continued, sometimes lasting for se- 
veral weeks with little intermission, especially during the months 
of September and October. The most prevalent diseases as con- 
nected with the climate are consumption and rheumatism. The 
parish is, however, healthy, there being commonly about twenty 
persons alive above eighty years of age. 

Hydrography. — There are a considerable number of springs in 
the parish, but none of them are remarkable for the quantity of 
water they discharge. The most important is at Loans Bridge, a 
chalybeate spring. A strong mineral spring, near Maulside, has 
long been noted for its salutary effects in scorbutic disorders. The 
valley of the Garnock appears to have been, at a remote period, 
a lake stretching from Dairy to Johnstone, in Renfrewshire, and of 
which the lochs of Kilbirnie and Castle Semple are the remains. 
In corroboration of this supposition, trees have been found im- 
bedded in the soil, which were apparently deposited by the ac- 
tion of water. The river Garnock, which has its source in the 
parish of Kilbirnie, on the confines of the county with Renfi-ew- 
shire, flows through this parish for seven miles, four of which are 
in a south-west direction. Below the manse it makes a sudden 
bend to the south, in which direction it flows for the remainder of 
its course to the sea, into which it falls at Irvine. It flows through 
a fertile plain, over a bed of gravel. Its declivity in this parish 
does not average above eight feet per mile, and in some places its 
motion is hardly perceptible. Its average breadth is about twenty 
yards. In its course through this parish it 'receives a number of 
tributary streams, the chief of which are the Rye and Caaf. The 
former stream rises in the parish of Largs, and flows through an 
open moorish country, till about three miles above its junction with 
the Garnock. It then enters a deep romantic glen, the banks of 
which are beautifully wooded, in which it rushes impetuously for 
two miles. It then enters the plain of Garnock, and joins that 
river after a course of nine miles. The Caaf has its source on 
the boundaries of Kilbride and Largs. On its descending from 
the moorish country, a dike of basaltic rock crosses its course, 
through which it has scooped a narrow passage, in which it rushes 
with inconceivable velocity. Its banks are almost destitute ot 
wood till near its junction with the Garnock, when it enters a deep

and rocky dell, and rushes through among immense blocks of free- 
stone, and over a succession of rapids, till it is precipitated over 
a considerable fall, forming a fine cascade, about 24 feet in height 
by 20 in width. Two large rocks rise upon each side of the cas- 
cade, while the adjacent banks are clothed with wood. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— T]\g strata on the east of the Gar- 
nock incline to the south, and partly to the east. Sandstone, lime- 
stone, and secondary trap greatly shattered, are the prevailing rocks. 
A field of limestone crosses the parish, south of the Dusk. North 
of this, a dike of trap rock stretches from near Blair House to the 
boundaries of Beith parish. Betwixt this and the Garnock is the 
coal formation ; the intervening strata are sandstone, limestone, 
shale, and indurated clay. The coal lies at a depth of 12 to 
30 fathoms. The seam is about 5 feet in thickness, and dips 
to the south 1 foot in 7. Various " steps" cross and derange 
the strata ; one of these raises the coal twelve fathoms, and an- 
other 8 fathoms. Various dikes of shale or " till" as it is provin- 
cially termed, also cross the strata. A dike of trap crosses the 
Barkip coal-field, in a direction from north-east to south-west. 
It is about 18 feet in thickness, and, for about the same distance on 
each side of the dike, the coal was completely charred. On the 
west of the Garnock two seams of coal are found. Dikes cross the 
strata chiefly south and north, and are formed of porphyry. Lime- 
stone is most abundant on this side of the parish. A field of hme- 
stone traverses its whole breadth, and is supposed to stretch from 
Ardrossan to Johnstone. The strata are less uniform than to the 
east of Garnock. The hills are composed of claystone porphyry, 
felspar porphyry, greenstone, wacke, and basalt. In the upper 
course of the Caaf, old red sandstone is abundant. Jasper is 
found among the porphyry rocks, and ribbon jasper is very abun- 
dant. Hornstone is found in the channel of the Caaf, in a bed of 
about ] 0 inches thick, resting on a species of limestone. Agates 
have been found in the water of Rye. Carbonate of lime is found 
imbedded in the greenstone trap rocks of Rye. Ironstone is found 
in various parts of the parish. Bands of ironstone are found in the 
roofs of the coal pits at Swinridgemuir. Near the summit of 
Baidland Hill, at a height of 800 feet above the sea, a vein or 
dike of cannel coal is found betwixt two walls of carboniferous 

' A valuable field of ironstone has been discovered since the Account was sent to 
press, on tlie estate of Blair, containing several seams, varying from two feet to six 
inches in thickness.

sandstone, the prevailing rock in the neighbourhod being porphyry. 
It runs in a direction from north-west to south-east, and is about 
6 feet in depth and 4 to 5 in width at the top. It is very in- 
flammable, and emits a strong sulphureous smell on being burned. 

The greater part of the limestone quarries abound in petrifac- 
tions. At Auchenskeigh these are numerous. Sea sand and 
small shells similar to those found on the sea shore are found in 
the incumbent earth. In sinking a coal mine recently at Swin- 
ridgemuir, great quantities of small shells were discovered in the 
indurated clay. Vegetable petrifactions are numerous in the free- 
stone quarries there, and in the freestone rocks small cavities are 
found filled with moss earth. 

Trees, chiefly oak, birch, and hazel, are found in all the mosses, 
generally lying in a direction from south-west to north-east. Se- 
veral years ago, some persons in digging peats on the Barkip Moss, 
discovered hairs adhering to the peats. On excavating the moss 
the body of a cow was laid bare, with a rope formed of " shercs" 
or the refuse of dressed lint, twisted about the horns. On being 
exposed to the atmosphere, the hair melted into a greasy substance, 
and the carcase speedily dissolved. 

Soil. — On the east of the Garnock, the soil is chiefly a thin, 
cold, tenacious clay, retentive of moisture. There is a portion of 
loamy soil along the banks of the Garnock. There is also a con- 
siderable extent of moss mostly under cultivation. In the holm 
lands the soil is a deep alluvial loam. In some places, ten feet 
deep of soil has been found. On the west of the Garnock, there 
is a considerable extent of adhesive clay soil. Along the base 
of the hills, the soil, being incumbent on limestone or trap, is 
generally light and dry. Although immense quantities of boulders 
have been removed from the soil within these twenty years, there 
are still great numbers unmolested, especially on the north side of 
the parish. 

Zoology. — The moor grounds abound with grouse, &amp;c. Snipes 
frequent the marshy places. Herons are almost daily to be seen 
in search of fish in the Garnock. The kingfisher is also occa- 
sionally observed. Trout are found in all the streams. The Dusk 
has long been famed for the abundance and excellence of its trouts. 
These fish are every year becoming less abundant. Bands of per- 
sons in spring and summer, when the waters of Rye, Caaf, and 
other streams are low, sweep every pool with small meshed nets, 
and, not content with this, destroy the fish with quickhme,— a ne-

ferious practice, which threatens to exterminate the whole fish in 
these waters. Salmon ascend the Garnock, but, owing to the 
shallowness of the water in summer, and the existence of a stake 
or bag-net fishery at the mouth of the river, few fish are to be 
found till near close-time. The salmon ascend to spawn in No- 
vember and December, and return in January and February. Great 
numbers are destroyed during the spawning season by poachers 
principally from Kilbirnie. From the heavy floods in winter, the 
spawning beds are greatly injured, and immense quantities of the 
spawn are destroyed by the carting away of gravel from the river 
during the spawning season. 

Botany, From the extent and diversity of soils in the parish, 

it affords a wide field for botanical research. In the glens of Rye, 
Caaf, and Dusk, many uncommon and rare plants are to be found, 
although the botany of the parish has not been sufficiently inves- 
tigated. The Hypericum AndroscBmum is found in the glen of Rye, 
along with the Campanula latifolia, and the Epilobium angusti- 
folium in abundance on the trap rocks, also the Viburnum Opuhis 
or guelder-rose, and the Paris quadrifoUa. The beautiful V ella 
annua or cress-rocket, grows in profusion along the banks of the 
Garnock. A little above the junction of that river with the Caaf, 
the Senecio saracenicus is found. The beautiful blue Geranium 
pratense grows abundantly by the road sides. In addition to the 
common blue hyacinth, which adorns every wood and glen, a white 
variety is also to be met with. The elegant Narcissus Pseudo- 
narcissus are found in the woody banks of the Dusk. A remark- 
ably beautiful species of the Bosa canina, or double dog-rose, 
grows plentifully on the road side from Dairy to Kilwinning by 
Blair. A beautiful species of double meadow ranunculus is found 
in the meadows above the Rye. Among other plants are the 
following : — Hypericum pulchrum, H. humifusum, Epilobium 
parviforum, Bidens trijmrtita, Bubus saxatilis, R. suberectus, 
,Lythrum salicaria, Ajuga reptans, Epipactis latifolia, Trifolium 
medium, SpircBa salicifolia, Circea lutetiana, Lychnis fios-Cuculi 
alba, Zanichellia palustris, Barbarea vidgaris, Geranium sylvati- 
cum, Tussilago petasites, Luzida maxima, Scirpus sylvaticus, Salix 
pentandra, Digitalis jnirpjurea,. AgrimoniaEupatoria, Nuphar lutea. 
White, red, and blue varieties of the Polygala vulgaris are abundant 
in the heathy grounds, as also a white variety of heath. Among the 
fungi are noticed. Boletus luteus, Amanita muscaria, and among 
the ferns Dlechnum borealc. Among the cryptogamous plants

may be enumerated Bryum turhinatum, B. lic/ulatum, B. Jiornum, 
Jungermannia asplenoides, J. hidevtata, Hookeria lucens. 

Plantations. — A great extent of land has been planted within 
these forty years, principally by Colonel Blair of Blair. The trees 
chiefly planted are the oak, ash, beech, elm, plane, chestnut, 
horse-chestnut, willow, silver, and spruce firs, and larch. The 
greater part of the Blair plantations have been formed on steep 
rocky banks, which in their natural state were of little value. 
Although the trees in these plantations have generally thriven ad- 
mirably, those with a northern, show a decided superiority over 
those with a southern exposure. The latter are more liable to be 
affected by the droughts of summer, and are more apt to become 
stinted in their growth ; while the wood is less firm in its texture, 
and not so durable as that which has a northern exposure. Ex- 
tensive plantations have been formed on moss-land by J. Smith, 
Esq. of Swinridgemuir, and A. Mitchell Esq. of Maulside ; espe- 
cially the latter gentleman, who has, by judicious planting, great- 
ly improved as well as beautified a portion of the parish, hitherto 
very bleak. The trees are healthy and thriving on this soil, and by 
no means inferior to any plantation in the neighbourhood. Al- 
though much has been effected in planting within these forty 
years, much still remains to be done. This is particularly the case 
in regard to the north and north-west sides of the parish. 

Lai'ge Trees. — In the vicinity of Blair House, there is growing 
a fine Spanish chestnut tree, behoved to be among the largest of 
the kind in Scotland. It rises with a beautiful stem for upwards 
of 20 feet. Its girth at the ground is 16 feet 6 inches. Three 
feet above the ground it is 13 feet 3 inches, and diminishes little 
to the first branch. It has a fine head of foliage ; although having 
formerly been nearly surrounded by other trees, its branches have 
not had full liberty to expand. It is growing on a sloping bank, 
having a north-west exposure. Its age is unknown. There are 
also some large plane-trees ; the largest measures in circumference 
18 feet 1 inch ; the first branch is 11 feet in girth. In the poli- 
cies are many beautiful specimens of evergreens, probably not ex- 
celled in Ayrshire. Many of the Portugal laurels exceed 30 feet 
in height. There are also some remarkably beautiful rhododen- 
drons, one of which covers a space of ground nearly 60 feet in cir- 
cumference ; and when in full flower nothing can exceed its 
splendid appearance.

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish. — The only history of the parish hitherto 
published is to be found in Robertson's Topographical Account of 
Cunlnghame. Colonel Blair, of Blair, has plans of every farm on 
his property, and a map of the whole estate. Many other proprie- 
tors have plans of their property. A map of the parish was pub- 
lished in 1827 by Mr Robert Aitken, land-surveyor, Beith. 

Witchcraft. — This parish was the scene of one of those revolting 
acts which disgrace the annals of Scotland, of condemning per- 
sons to the flames for the imputed crimes of sorcery and witch- 
craft. This case, wjiich is allowed to be the most extraordinary 
on record, occurred in 1576. Elizabeth or Bessie Dunlop, spouse 
of Andrew Jack in Linn, was arraigned before the High Court 
of Justiciary, accused of sorcery, witchcraft, &amp;c. Her own con- 
fession appears to have formed the principal evidence against her, 
and this was doubtless procured by torture. The substance of it 
was as follows : That one day when driving her cows to pas- 
ture, being greatly grieved by reason of affliction in her family, a 
person appeared to her who described himself as one Thome Reid, 
officer to the laird of Blair, who had died at Pinkie, and who in- 
formed her of what would take place in her family. Thome visit- 
ed her frequently after this, by whose aid she commenced the 
practice of a wise woman, curing diseases, and assisting in the re- 
covery of stolen goods. Her profession appears to have prospered 
until she drew the evil eye of the law upon her, when, having been 
apprehended and imprisoned in the jail of Irvine, and subsequent- 
ly tried at Edinburgh, she was condemned to be " loorried" at the 
stake, before being consumed by the flames. The intervention of 
Thome Reid, as a partner in guilt, did not avail the unfortunate 
woman, neither did the fact operate in her favour, that her skill 
was never directed to iniquitous or hurtful ends. It is rather sin- 
gular that no tradition exists of this tragical occurrence in the 
neighbourhood.f 

Eminent Characters. — Among the patriots who resisted the 
usurpation of Edward I., Sir Bryce Blair stands distinguished. 
This parish has the high honour of being"the birth place of this 
distinguished individual. Under pretence of holding a Justice- 

• Liiin or Lynne, originally the property of an ancient family of the name of Lynne, 
is believed to be the locality of the well known poem in Percie's lleliques of Ancient 
Poetry, " The Heir of J.ynne."

Walter Scott has embodied it in his treatise onV Demonology and Witchcraft."

aire, he was invited to Ayr, and there treacherously slain by the 
English in 1296, along with many other of the Ayrshire barons, 
among whom was the uncle of Sir William Wallace. Wallace 
did not fail amply to retaliate, by burning the English garrison at 
Ayr. 

Captain Thomas Crawford, the captor of Dumbarton Castle 
in the reign of the unfortunate Mary, resided in this parish, 
having married the daughter and heiress of Ker of Kersland. His 
eldest son succeeded to the estate of Kersland, whose grandson, 
Robert Ker of Kersland, distinguished himself during the reign 
of Charles II. Being a zealous Covenanter, and deeming the 
form of Episcopacy forced by a profligate monarch on a re- 
luctant nation, to be the prelude to Popery, he did not hesi- 
tate to join himself to that devoted band, who, in defence of their 
liberty and their faith, " loved not their lives unto the death." 
Having been concerned in a meeting at Chitterjlet, now Shutterjlat, 
near Beith, along with a number of the western gentlemen, he was 
accused of rebellion,— and being tried in his absence, his life was 
forfeited, his estate confiscated, and himself compelled to fly into 
Holland. Subsequently returning, he was apprehended and im- 
prisoned for many years. The prison, however, took fire, and, mak- 
ing his escape, he again returned to Holland, where he died in 
1680. At the Revolution his estate was restored to his family.  
It came into the possession of John Crawford of Fergushill, who 
married his daughter, and assumed the name of Ker. This indi- 
vidual, by his political tergiversations, acquired considerable cele- 
brity during the reigns of Queen Anne, and George I. His me- 
moirs of these transactions are well known. 

Sir Robert Cunningham, of Auchenharvie, was a native of this 
parish. Having studied medicine, he soon became eminent in 
his profession, and was appointed physician to Charles II. for Scot- 
land. He accompanied Charles into England, and was of great ser- 
vice at the battle of Worcester. Having been taken prisoner, he 
was committed to the Tower; but in regard of his high talents,

he was after a short imprisonment liberated by the Protector. 
After the restoration, he was reinstated in his office, and created 
a baronet of Nova Scotia. 

Chief Land-Owners. — Colonel Blair of Blair is the largest pro- 
prietor, being possessed of nearly a third of the parish. The 
Earl of Glasgow ranks next in order. The following heritors 
have also considerable properties within the parish : John Smith, 
Esq. Swinridgemuir ; Ebenezer Smith, Esq. Pitcon ; William 
Millar, Esq. of Monkcastle, Windyedge, &amp;c. ; Miss Morris of 
Craig, Auldmuir ; Lady Mary Montgomerie, Munoch : William 
Patrick, Esq. W. S. Barkip ; J. Crichton, Linn, &amp;c. The total 
number of proprietors is 90. 

Parochial Registers. — The earliest existing registers are of births 
and marriages, and commence in 1683, but have not been regu- 
larly kept till 1724; from which period they are complete till the 
present time. The records of the transactions of the kirk-session 
commence in 1693, and, excepting a blank from 1701 to 1717, 
have been most accurately kept to 1765. From that time to the 
incumbency of the present minister in 1821, -it appears that the 
minutes of session were written on detached slips of paper, and, as 
might be expected from such a slovenly practice, they have all 
been lost. 

Antiquities. — On the summit of Caerwinning hill are the re- 
mains of an ancient fortification. It appears to have been formed 
of three concentric circles or walls of stone, inclosing a space of 
two acres. The greater part of the materials of which it was com- 
posed have been removed to build fences, &amp;c. The outer wall 
cannot now be easily traced, but, from what remains, it appears to 
have been from 10 to 12 feet in thickness. The entrance has 
been on the western side. The vestiges of a fosse or ditch are still 
visible at the foot of the hill. It must have been a place of great 
strength, and commands a view of the surrounding country for 
many miles. The stones must have been brought from a considera- 
ble distance, being a species of tuffaceous trap, while the hill it- 
self is composed of felspar porphyry. It is believed that the Scot- 
tish army were encamped in this fortification previous to the bat- 
tle of Largs. The ruins of an ancient square fort formerly stood 
on the banks of the Rye, on the brink of a precipitous rock call- 
ed the Aitnach Craig. About forty years ago they were wholly 
removed. 

In the vicinity of the town is an ancient mound called the 



220 



AYRSHIRE. 



Courthill. It is of a conical form, and is covered with the finest 
verdure. These mounds appear to have been the places for dis- 
pensing justice. A stone, which tradition asserts to have support- 
ed the gallows, formerly stood a little east of the moat. A few 
years ago an attempt was made to level this interesting monument 
of antiquity, in order to fill up some hollows in the field where it 
is situated, but the hill proving to have been formed of rubbish, 
the design was abandoned, not, however, till its appearance was 
greatly disfigured. Various tumuli have been discovered in this 
parish. In forming the road to Auchinmede a stone coffin was 
discovered containing human bones. A cairn was removed on the 
lands of Camphill, on the formation of the Largs road, which con- 
tained human bones, probably of some warrior who fell at the bat- 
tle of Largs. On the lands of Linn, where the ruins of a Romish 
chapel lately stood, four urns were found containing burnt human 
bones. At Auchingree two similar urns were also discovered. 
About ten years ago, an urn was discovered near Blair House, 
containing burnt bones, and ashes apparently of coal. A part of 
the jawbone was unconsumed, which, with the remains of the urn, is 
in the possession of the gardener at Blair. A sword was found 
a few years since in the vicinity of Dairy. The blade fell to pieces 
on being removed ; the handle is of brass in two hollow pieces 
soldered together, and is ornamented with the figure of a dragon. 
It is now in the possession of Mr Andrew Crawford, Courthill, 
who has likewise one of those ancient spinning instruments, the 
" rock," which was in the possession of the family of Hugh Brown, 
piper, since 1498, till within these few years, when its present 
owner acquired it. 

There is in the parish church an old oak seat, which was ori- 
ginally the family pew of the Boyds of Pitcon, now extinct. It 
has the arms of the family, with the initials R. B., and the date 
1634, carved on the back, and is in excellent preservation. 

Modern Buildings.— kn elegant mansion has been built at 
Swinridgemuir by Mr Smith, the stones being procured from the 
quarry on his own estate.— Mr Mitchell of Maulside has erected 
a commodious house on his property.— An excellent inn has been 
built in the village within the last two years, with a large hall at- 
tached.— A gas work was erected in 1833. The building mate- 
rials are chiefly procured from Swinridgemuir and Highfield quar-

The small increase of the population since 1831 may be ac- 
counted for partly by the ravages of cholera, and also from the 
small number of houses that have been built of late years. Many 
families have been obhged to leave the parish in consequence of 
their inabiUty to procure houses.

It is beUeved that this is nearly correct. Every child baptised 
in the Established Church must be registered previously. There 
are only two instances in the last seven years of persons not be- 
longing to the Established Church registering the births of their 
children. A register is kept by the United Secession congrega- 
tion, but, owing to the neglect of parents in registering their child- 
ren, its accuracy cannot be depended on. The average number 
of marriages is 32. It has been impossible to ascertain the num- 
ber of deaths, no register being kept.

Language. — Within the last forty years the language has con- 
siderably improved. The English has greatly superseded the 
Scottish dialect of that period. Many words that were in common 
use at that time would now be utterly unintelligible to the majo- 
rity of the existing generation. 

Customs — Amusements. — The ancient custom of " creeling" is 
still in existence in this parish. In former days, when penny- 
weddings were in vogue, it was customary for the parties who 
were at the wedding to assemble the following day, in order to 
" creel" the bridegroom. Having procured a creel or wicker bas- 
ket, they tied it on the back of the young gudeman, and placed a 
long pole with a broom affixed to the top, over his left shoulder. 
Thus equipped he was forced to run a race, followed by the young 
gudewife with a knife to cut the cords, and who, according to the 
alacrity with which she endeavoured to unloose the creel, showed 
her satisfaction at the marriage. After which the parties return- 
ed to the house to consume the fragments of the preceding day's 
feast. About forty or fifty years ago, weddings having become 
less numerously attended than formerly, the custom underwent 
considerable alteration, and was deferred to new-year's-day. Ac- 
cordingly, on this morning the young men of the village assemble 
provided with a wicker hamper, or crockery crate, filled with stones, 
with which they visit the houses of all those who may have enter- 
ed the bands of matrimony during the preceding year, and compel 
each young gudeman to bear the " creel" to his nearest neighbour 
who may have qualified himself for the honour. Resistance is ge- 
nerally useless, as a number of stout fellows soon compel the re- 
fractory person to submit, with the addition probably of one of 
their number in the " creel," as the reward of his obduracy. The 
" creeling" is generally, however, conducted throughout with the 
greatest good humour ; yet, harmless as the custom is, individuals 
have been known, who, in order to avoid the ceremony, have re- 
gularly for fifteen years absented themselves from home for a 
fortnight at that season.

The custom of the " baal-fire" or " Taniiel" is still observed on 
the last of July, St Margaret's Day. For some weeks previous, the 
boys perambulate the parish with large horns, soliciting contribu- 
tions for the purchase of coals for the bonfire. Formerly, it was 
customary to have a piper, and dance a reel round the tannel, but 
this has fallen into desuetude. These bonfires are believed to have 
originated in the baal-fires of the Scandinavians, and to have been 
adopted, along with other Pagan ceremonies, by the Romish clergy, 
and transferred to the anniversary of some tutelar saint, — no doubt 
with the view of reconciling the people to Christianity, by incor- 
porating with it the observances of their ancient superstition. 

The game of kyles is a very popular amusement in this parish. 
Curling is a favourite game ; but, from the mildness of the winters 
for many years, an opportunity rarely occurs of enjoying it. 

Habits of the People, 8c. — The people are generally cleanly in 
their habits. Within the last fifteen years, a great change has taken 
place on the dress of the people. On Sabbaths they appear in a 
style little if anything inferior to that of the inhabitants in the same 
rank of life of Edinburgh or Glasgow. The ancient checked plaid 
still maintains its place in the ordinary dress of females. It is 
formed of red and blue or green checks, and worn over the head 
and shoulders, hanging down in front. 

With some few exceptions, the farmers and proprietors commonly 
take their principal meals along with their servants, who receive 
the same treatment as their own families, — and in no part of the 
country are farm-servants more uniformly better treated than in 
this parish. The ordinary food of the country people is for break- 
fast oatmeal porridge, made with whey, bread, cheese and milk, — ' 
in winter, pork-ham is given instead of cheese. For dinner, broth, 
beef, potatoes, bread, cheese and milk, with variations of pork or 

 The kyles or keels are nine wooden pins turned out of ash, about a foot in length, 
and two inches in diameter at bottom, tapering towards the top. One of these is 
rather thicker and two inches longer than the rest, and is denominated the king. The 
kyles are placed upright, about nine inches distant from each other, in three lines, the 
king in the centre, forming a parallelogram, with the angle towards the player, who 
stands about thirty yards distant, arid aims a wooden ball about nine inches diameter 
at the kyles. Whether he overturns them or not he is entitled to another throw from 
the place to which the ball has rolled. The great difficulty in playing the game, and 
in which the most skill is requisite, is to throw down the exact number which com- 
pletes the game ; for instance should forty be the game, and one party stood thirty- 
five, if the person whose turn it might be to play overturned six kyles, the party could 
be " debuished ;" that is, they resume their former position in the game, while the 
" debuisher" would play the stroke over again. The king counts no more should it 
be overturned along with the others than a common kyle ; but should it be struck 
down without overturning any other kylc, a rare achievement, it is deemed equivalent 
to prostrating them all.

fish. Porridge generally for supper, or potatoes pared, boiled, and 
mashed with butter. Scones made from a mixture of oats, pease, 
or beans, with wheat or barley, ground fine, and denominated 
" mashlum" are in general use, and form a wholesome and pala- 
table food. 

Although the greater part of the manufacturing population have 
for some years had to contend with low wages, and often a scanty 
supply of work, provisions have been low, and articles of clothing 
cheap, — and the majority of the members of families being engaged 
in some employment, with industry, temperate habits, and frugal 
management, the working classes have been enabled i&amp; enjoy a rea- 
sonable share of the comforts of society. The great body of the 
people may be said to be contented in their circumstances. The 
people are in general of an intellectual character. The majority of 
them are moral in their habits, and strictly attentive to their reli- 
gious duties. 

Poaching.— k number of years ago, the parish was infested by 
a gang of notorious poachers, persons of idle, drunken, disorderly 
habits and profligate manners. These, however, have been broken 
up and dispersed, so that there is not above one or two individuals 
at present in the parish addicted to this demoralizing pursuit. 
There is still some salmon poaching, although it is decreasing. 
Smuggling and pawnbroking are alike unknown in this parish. 

During the last three years there were 21 illegitimate births in 
the parish.

From the marks of the plough still visible on the hdl sides, it 
appears that land was formerly under cultivation, which now re- 
mains unmolested by either plough or spade. In former times the 
lowlands being exhausted by the wretched mode of husbandry 
then practised, produced httle but weeds; and m order to raise 
corn sufficient for the subsistence of the population, it was neces- 
sary to have recourse to the hill lands. There are about 500 acres

which might be added to the cultivated land. There is no common 
in the parish. 

The number of acres under wood is about 670. Pruning is 
usually performed from February to the end of April. The young 
wood, especially larch, is pruned with a bill-hook. The hard-wood 
is pruned as close .to the trunk of the tree as is possible without 
injuring the bark. A small axe is generally used in the operation, 
and afterwards pared with a hand-knife. Full-grown trees are 
usually thinned when they begin to overtop each other. 

Rent. — The rent of arable land averages L. 1, 5s. per impe- 
rial acre. The grazing of a cow, L. 3; of a quey, L. 1, 15s. ; of

Breed of Stock. — The black-faced Linton forms the principal 
part of the sheep kept. Attempts are beginning to be made to 
improve the breed by a better selection of rams. In the lower 
parts of the parish, on most farms, a few sheep are kept, a cross 
betwixt the Cheviot and the old Leicester breed. 

The Cunninghame or dairy breed is the only species of cattle 
reared. Although great attention is paid to the breeding of stock, 
the greater number of prize cattle in the neighbourhood being de- 
rived from the breeding stocks of this parish, still the breed has 
degenerated, the present stock of cattle in the parish being infe- 
rior to what it was twenty years ago. This may be ascribed to the 
high prices which first-rate cows bring, and to the great tempta- 
tions which farmers are under to dispose of them, owing to the low 
price of farm produce and high rents. Cattle-shows have aided 

AYR. p 



22G 



AYRSHIRE. 



to accelerate the disposal of them, — very many of the young prize 
cattle being sold to dealers immediately after the exhibition. The 
degeneracy is also owing to breeding from animals too closely con- 
nected, some farmers almost exclusively breeding " in and in." 

Dairy. — This district has long been celebrated for the excel- 
lence of its dairy produce, the milk being almost universally made 
into cheese. The number of cows at present ept in the parish 
is 1405. The annual produce of a cow in cheese in some situa- 
tions will exceed thirty-five imperial stones, while in others it will 
not reach nineteen stones. The average produce for each cow 
may be about twenty-five imperial stones of sweet-milk cheese 
annually, or 35125 stones for the whole parish. Great care is 
taken in the manufacture of the cheese, and the utmost attention 
paid to cleanliness in all the operations of the dairy. The whey 
is given to pigs, the whey from three cows being sufficient to main- 
tain a pig during summer. The cows are pastured during summer. 
In winter, on some farms, they receive turnips. In the greater 
number of cases, however, their only food is oat straw or meadow 
hay. After calving, they are allowed rye-grass hay and boiled food, 
till the grass affords a full bite. From the almost universal prac- 
tice of allowing the rye-grass to ripen for seed previous to being 
cut, and the variety sown being chiefly annual seed, the pasture 
during the succeeding season is vei-y bare, except on rich soils ; 
and the cows being allowed to range the fields during winter un- 
til a few weeks previous to their calving, the fields are greatly, 
poached, and the grass so injured, that sometimes the beginning 
of June elapses before the pastures afford a full bite. If a more 
rational system of laying down grass lands were practised, and the 
frequent drain system fully extended, the dairy produce of the pa- 
rish might be doubled. 

Husbandry. — The dairy forming the principal feature in the 
husbandry, nearly two-thirds of the arable land are in pasture. The 
tenants are restricted to cropping one-third, and in many instances 
one-fourth only is allowed to be under tillage. The rotation on 
five-sixths of the farms in the parish is two white crops, one of hay, 
and four or five years in pasture. Oats is the crop generally 
taken, excepting that a portion may be under potatoes, beans, &amp;c. 
and should there be an intervening green crop, three years' tillage 
is permitted. On the holm lands and farms nearer the town, where 
there is easier access to manure, two-thirds are under croppmg, and 
a more liberal rotation being practised, the lands are under high 



DALRY. 



227 



cultivation, although on no farm is there a uniform rotation pursued. 
Summer-fallowing is practised by only a few individuals. About 
thirty-five imperial acres were under fallow last season, which was 
rather an unusual quantity. The cultivation of wheat has increas- 
ed during the last fifteen years. In 1819 there were 18 Scotch 
acres of wheat ; last year there were 250 imperial acres under this 
crop. The principal green crop is potatoes. The inhabitants of 
the town usually take as much ground from the neighbouring far- 
mers as the ashes, &amp;c. they collect through the year can manure. 
The faj-mer performs all the carting, ploughing, and horse-hoeing. 
The town's people plant and dig the potatoes, while the hand-hoe- 
ing and weeding is a pleasant recreation to them during the sum- 
mer evenings. The rent is from 6d. to lOd. per fall, and the pro- 
duce from eight to sixteen imperial stones per fall. This mode of 
procedure is beneficial to both parties. The farmer receives from 
L.4, 10s. to L. 6, 10s. of rent per acre, and has, besides, his land 
manured at the rate of thirty or forty tons per acre ; and the town's 
people have an abundant supply of a valuable article of food for 
less than one penny per stone, exclusive, of course, of the manure. 
Owing to the manure being mostly required for potatoes or beans, 
turnips have been little cultivated, although they are now sown in 
greater quantities than formerly. The crops are usually very 
heavy; and, including leaves, ninety-seven tons have been raised 
from one Scotch acre. The number of stock fed on turnips is li- 
mited, and consuming them on the field with sheep is unknown. 
Bone manure has only been tried by two individuals, but not with 
much success, owing to the loaminess of the soil. On the lighter 
soils no attempt has hitherto been made to prove its efficacy, but 
one farmer intends this year to give it a trial. 

The rye-grass is allowed to ripen for seed, and after being mown, 
it is tied and stocked in the same manner as corn. When it has 
stood a sufficient time to allow the seed to harden, it is thrashed, 
and the seed sold to dealers, who export it to the English markets, 
from whence, under the name of English seed, it often returns the 
succeeding spring to other parts of the country. The produce va- 
ries from twelve to thirty bushels per acre, and the price from 5s. 
to 12s. per four bushels. The natural juices of the hay being ab- 
sorbed before it is cut, renders it hard and dry, and greatly injures 
its quality ; and if the hay be annual or a heavy crop, the land, 
instead of the verdure of a grass field, presents rather the appear- 
ance of corn stubble. The harvest often proving wet, in order to 



228 



AYllSHIRE. 



prevent the corn from receiving injury from the weather, previous 
to beinw stacked, it is built into small piles called huts, contain- 
ing five or six stocks each. The manner of forming these huts 
is as follows ; two sheaves are set up reclining against each other, 
two sheaves are placed at right angles against these; so as to form 
a small pyramid ; a row of sheaves is next placed sloping around 
these ; another course is then made, which forms the base of the 
hut, about five feet it diameter. On this more courses are built, 
each course decreasing in diameter until the hut assumes the form 
of a cone. Two large sheaves are then placed upon the top, the 
bands being drawn up so as to allow the bottoms of the sheaves to 
be spread out and form a thatch. A small rope is then twisted 
from the grassy end of the sheaf, with which the top sheaves are 
firmly bound together. When neatly formed, these huts will re- 
sist the heaviest rains for several weeks, the top sheaves only sus- 
taining injury. 

Draining, 8fc. — Draining has been carried on to a great ex- 
tent within these few years. During the last year alone, up- 
wards of 100,000 yards of drains were executed in this parish« 
The size of the drains varies according to soil and circumstances. 
In general they are from 15 to 30 inches in depth, and from 5 to 
9 in width at bottom. On moss land, drains in every alternate fur- 
row have been cut A\ feet deep and 18 inches wide. Stones, from 
their abundance, have been principally used here as draining ma- 
terials. The expense of cutting a drain is from Ud. to 4d. per fall 
of six yards. The expense of a drain 26 inches deep by 9 wide, 
may cost 9d. per fall, including all expenses. The cost, however, 
varies according to soil and access to materials for filling the drams. 
In general it may be stated at from L. 5 to L. 8 per acre. Tile- 
draining is becoming more general; and, owing to the difficulty in 
wet seasons of carting the stones, there can be no doubt, that, were 
a tile-work erected in the parish, the use of stones in draining 
would in a great degree be superseded. Turf, straw, rushes, and 
the branches of the Scots fir, as they can be procured, are placed 
above the tiles to prevent the loose earth from entering and stop- 
ping the drains. In many situations gravel might be procured, or 
even micaceous schistus might be useful to place above the tiles. 
The greater part of the draining has been excuted at the sole es- 

• Since this Account was sent to press, a lie-work has been erected, and is now 
ia opei ation on the estate of Blair.

pense of the tenants. There are proprietors who bear a hberal pro- 
portion of the expense, but these unfortunately are few. 

In the irrigation of land, the water is generally turned over the 
meadows during the months of October and November. 

Embankments have been erected along the banks of the Gar- 
nock, to prevent its aggressions during inundations. These are 
principally formed of earth, in some places faced with stone. 
Stone walls have also been erected in some situations. These 
have all been built within these forty years. 

Leases.— Ye\N of the leases extend to nineteen years, the great- 
er number being from ten to fifteen years duration. And some pro- 
prietors have adopted the short-sighted policy of letting their lands 
for hco or three years only. For lands in high cultivation, which re- 
quire little or no outlay beyond the expense of cultivation, twelve 
or fifteen years may be a sufficient length of lease. But when 
great outlay is required for improvement, as is the case with the 
greater number of the farms in the parish, this is too short a 
period to remunerate an enterprising tenant for his capital and 

skill, while on a iioo years lease, not only is all improvement at 

a stand, but even the fences are in danger of becoming ruinous. 
The depreciation of the currency is the reason assigned for these 
short leases, which have such a tendency to produce a deteriora- 
tion of the soil. 

Farm-Buildings. — Within the last forty years, the greater part 
of the farm-houses have been rebuilt or repaired. Many of them 
are two storeys high, all are built of stone and mostly slated. There 
are a few old steadings still remaining, generally wretched incom- 
modious buildings,— these, however, are gradually being displaced 
by more ample houses. In general too little attention is paid to 
cleanliness or neatness around the farm-houses, although in this 
respect great improvement is taking place. The parish has long 
been enclosed and subdivided in the higher parts with stone dikes, 
and in the lower parts with thorn hedges. Although the latter 
may be said to' be in good condition, still, with the exception of the 
hedges around the gentlemen's policies, the farm of Ryesholm, 
and some other places, too little attention is bestowed on the 
management and dressing of them. 

Jmprovements. — The most important improvement has been the 
reclaiming of moss land by the application of lime. John Smith, 
Esq. of Swinridgemuir, has the honour of introducing this im- 
provement. Mr Smith's attention was first directed to the sub- 



230 



AYRSHIRE. 



ject by observing the effects produced on a piece of moss, where 
lime had been accidentally overturned, and which was covered 
with the finest herbage, while all around retained its original bar- 
renness. To many the circumstance would not have appeared 
deserving of notice, but Mr Smith being engaged at the time in 
endeavouring to improve the moss that disfigured his estate, by 
paring and burning, his active and intelligent mind soon perceived 
the efficacious nature of the hme, and its vast superiority over the 
paring and burning system. It is unnecessary here to enter into 
a detail of the experiments which Mr Smith immediately com- 
menced, and which were attended with complete success. Like 
many other improvements which have prejudice and ignorance to 
encounter, Mr Smith's experiments excited the universal derision 
and ridicule of his neighbours, — but the valuable crops which the 
moss produced, soon induced his tenants and others to follow his 
example ; and the consequence has been, that extensive mosses 
which, in their natural state, were not worth a shilling an acre, 
have been converted into excellent land, and in some instances 
have yielded from ten to fifteen quarters of oats from a single 
Scotch acre. Although it is unnecessary to particularize all the 
improvements made on moss land, those effected on the estate of 
Maulside, by Andrew Mitchell, Esq. writer, Glasgow, are de- 
serving of attention. This moss was of as sterile a nature as can 
well be conceived, having for ages been used for peats. By ex- 
tensive draining and levelling, however, and removing in some 
places twelve feet of moss, and by incorporating with it immense 
quantities of clay, together with lime and other dung, it has been 
converted into a fertile soil. The first crop of oats it produced 
was valued at L. 11 per Scots acre, and the succeeding crop of hay 
at L. 7 per acre. Mr Mitchell has planted considerable plantations, 
which greatly beautify as well as shelter the surrounding country. 

Within these twenty years, extensive improvements have been 
made in the irrigation of land. Large tracts of land in the high- 
er parts of the parish, which formerly were not worth five shillings 
an acre, and bore nothing but heather, have, since the introduc- 
tion of irrigation, become greatly increased in value, and now bear 
abundant crops of hay. Mr Robert Speirs of South Camphill has 
been the most extensive and successful improver in this branch of 
rural economy. A great extent of waste land has been brought 
under cultivation. ' Thorough draining has been extensively prac- 
tised. The old high and crooked ridges have been levelled and 



91 

DALRY. 



Straightened. The increased faciUty afforded by the formation of 
new, and the repairing of old, roads has in no small degree con- 
duced to these improvements. An excellent road has been termed 
between Dairy and Largs, instead of the dangerous horse-path, 
which was formerly the only means of communication. A new 
road has been made from Dairy to Beith, whereby carriers are en- 
abled to bring from thirty to forty cwt. on a single horse cart, and 
on which a four-horse stage-coach runs. The greater part of the 
road is over land, which, thirty years ago, would hardly sustain the 
weight of a sheep. A new road has been formed from Kilbride 
and Ardrossan to near Dairy, but, from want of funds, the trus- 
tees have not been able to complete it ; and the old road which it 
joins being very steep and ill kept, the public have not enjoyed the 
benefit that would otherwise have been derived from it. 

Obstacles to Improvement.— Amoug the obstacles to improve- 
ment, is the decreasing capital of farmers, owing to low prices and 
high rents. Short leases, too, are an insurmountable obstacle to 
improvement, and it is preposterous in landlords to expect that 
farmers will expend their capital on a lease of ten or twelve years 
duration. Moreover, few proprietors are willing to give encourage- 
ment to improvement by defraying a portion of the expense ne- 
cessary to effect that object. Perhaps the main cause of this un- 
wiUingness on the part of landlords arises from the [;perpetual 
threatening of alterations on the corn laws, by a certain |class of 
politicians, who hold forth their repeal as a panacea for every evil, 
whether real or imaginary, with which the state may be afflicted. 
When at present  in this parish the best wheat will not average 
4s. 3d. per bushel, — a lower price than at the date of the last 
Statistical Account, and when good bread is sold for 4d. the 
four pound loaf, and fine at 5d.,— it must appear how little reason 
there is to allege that the corn laws are a burden on the labour- 
ing classes. One serious obstacle to improvement in a considerable 
portion of the parish, is the great increase of game, especially of 
hares, which have increased to such an extent, that on some farms 
the produce will scarcely meet the cost of the seed and labour. 

Mines and Quarries. — There are at present five coal-pits at work 
in the parish. In the barony of Kersland the coal has been long 
wrought. The workings were commenced at the western extre- 
mity on a level with the Garnock, and have hitherto been wrought 
to the crop of the coal, which is nearly exhausted. A considerable 



» Novumber 1835. 



232 



AYRSHlllE, 



portion of the dip still remains to work. Furnaces have been 
erected at this pit for the burning of coke. The Swinridgemuir 
pits are in the same coal field with this last. They are about thirty 
fathoms deep ; the seam is about five feet thick. There is a pit 
at Coal-burn, and a small one at Cleaves. There is a pit also at 
Hillend of Pitcon, and another was sunk last year in the Earl of 
Glasgow's farm of Ryesholm. The coals are in general of excel- 
lent quality. The most valuable quarries in the parish are those of 
limestone. In addition to the limestone which many farmers burn 
for themselves, there are three public lime-works. The most ex- 
tensive of these is at Howrat, on the Largs road. At Highfield and 
Auldmuir, limestone is raised and burned in considerable quantities. 
The lime is sold at the kilns at Is. 3d. and Is. 6d. per boll of five 
bushels. The boll is merely nominal, as no measure is used, — 
but an ordinary cart, which may contain sixteen bushels of un- 
slacked lime, is considered as holding two bolls.

as can be ascertained, is as follows : —

Although considerable pains have been taken to ascertain the 
amount of raw produce, by a personal survey of each farm, the 
result is given with much doubt. 

Manufactures. — Weaving is the principal manufacture in Dairy. 
The number of weavers is 500, of whom 61 are females, and 104 
are apprentices. They are chiefly employed in silk and harness 
weaving, for the Paisley and Glasgow manufacturers. In general, 
the present rate of wages in Dairy would afford the weaver a fair 
remuneration for his labour, if he were constantly employed. The 
intelligence and enterprise of the weavers of Dairy prevented 
them from suffering, what, but for these qualities, they would have 
done on the depression occasioned to the cotton weaving by the 



4 

DALRY. 



233 



introduction of the power-loom. For early directing their atten- 
tion to the higher descriptions of work, with which the power- 
looms cannot enter into competition, they thus saved their circum- 
stances from undergoing that degree of depression which their fel- 
low operatives endured in many other places. 

In the former Account it was mentioned, that a company had 
erected a mill for the spinning of cotton, to which a large addition 
was in progress of building. Since that time, it has fallen into the 
possession of one individual, who converted it into a woollen card- 
ing and spinning-mill. It is driven by a large water-wheel, to 
which a steam engine has lately been added. Last year it was 
entirely fitted up with new machinery, for the slobing and spinning 
of carpet yarn. It gives employment to nine men, four women, 
and thirty boys and girls. The men receive from 6s. to 12s. per 
week, the women 4s. to 6s., and the children from 2s. 6d. to 5s. 
per week. This employment is not unfavourable to health. 

A large number of the females in the parish are employed in 
sewing and embroidering for the Glasgow and Paisley markets, 
usually denominated Ayrshire needle-work. A good sewer may 
earn Id. each hour at ordinary white work. For a short pe- 
riod during summer, when embroidery is brisk, Is. 6d. to 2s. per 
day is occasionally earned at from fourteen to sixteen hours sitting. 
But this is gained at the probable sacrifice of health. 

At Auchingree a small manufactory is established for turning 
wooden plates, ladles, and other culinary utensils, — it is driven 
by a small steam engine of two horse power. 

Agricultural Association. — The Ardrossan Farmers' Society 
comprises this parish within its bounds, the annual cattle exhibi- 
tion and ploughing-match being occasionally held here. The 
general Ayrshire Agricultural Association has determined to hold 
their exhibition in Cunninghame, at Dairy, alternately with Kil- 
marnock. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Town. — Dairy, the only town in the parish, is distant five miles S. 
W. from Beith, sixteen from Paisley, seven N. W. from Irvine, and 
fourteen from Kilmarnock, where a weekly grain market is held. It is 
beautifully situated on a considerable eminence on the right bank 
of the Garnock, betwixt the confluences of Rye and Caaf with 
that river, and appears to considerable advantage when viewed from 
the S. E. It owes its origin to the removal of the church to its 
present site, about 1608. At the beginning of last century there 



234 



AYRSHIRE. 



were only six houses of two storeys in the village, the population 
not exceeding 100. At the date of the last -Statistical Account, 
the number of persons was 800 ; while at present the population 
is about 2000. The town consists of five streets, three of which, 
meeting nearly in its centre, form a small square. It contains a 
considerable number of well-built houses, and can boast of several 
excellent shops. There are three haberdashers, eight grocers, four 
bakers, and four inns, which afford every accommodation to travellers, 
besides five public-houses. A gas company was formed, and gas 
works erected in 1834. Like those of the majority of places which 
possess no system of police, the streets are generally in a very 
miry condition. They have lately been lighted with gas, the ex- 
pense of which has been defrayed by subscription among the in- 
habitants. The chief employment of the population is weaving 
for the Glasgow and Paisley manufacturers. 

Means of Communication. — The parish enjoys ample means of 
communication. There is a daily post, and a stage-coach from 
Saltcoats to Glasgow, which passes every morning, and returns in the 
evening. Two carriers travel twice a week to Paisley and Glas- 
gow, while intercourse is maintained almost daily with the sur- 
rounding towns and villages, by the bread-carts which leave Dai- 
ry. The turnpike roads extend 22 miles in length ; and the 
parish roads 26 miles. There are five toll-bars in the pa- 
rish. The rates are moderate, — 2d. being charged for a cart, and 
Id. for a horse, with the exception of the bar on the Largs road, 
the charge at which trebles that of the other tolls. The roads in 
general are in good order, though many of them are steep and ill- 
directed. About eighty years ago, there was nothing deserving the 
name of a road in the parish, the intercourse being chiefly carried 
on on horseback, or on cars destitute of wheels. The roads were 
consequently mere horse-paths, and, from the boggy nature of the 
low grounds, the more hilly paths were preferred. As intercourse 
increased, these gradually underwent repair, until they assumed 
their present appearance. "Wherever practicable, the acclivities 
have been cut, or new roads formed to avoid them. 

Bridges. — The Garnock is crossed by two stone bridges, one of 
two, and another of three arches. Both of these were origi- 
nally steep and narrow, but at the formation of the new road to 
Beith the steepness was remedied, although they still continue as 
narrow as ever. A new bridge has been erected over the Rye, 

and another over the Caaf; both of them single arched. From

the great number of streams, bridges are numerous, and are gene- 
rally in good condition, unless where the ledges have been wanton- 
ly thrown down ; a practice disgraceful, though not peculiar to this 
parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — There were originally two churches in the 
parish. It appears from inscriptions on stones built into the pre- 
sent church, that these were united, and a church erected in its 
present site about the commencement of the seventeenth century. 
The church is distant six miles from the northern,, and three and 
a-half from the eastern and southern boundaries of the parish; and 
is as conveniently situated for the greater part of the population, 
as the figure of the parish will admit. It is a plain edifice, and 
was erected in 1771, and received extensive internal repair in 1821, 
cast-iron pillars having been introduced to support the galleries 
and roof in place of the former wooden ones. It cannot, however, 
be pronounced in a sufficient condition, the walls being rent and 
forced outwards, while the roof has bent inwards. It affords ac- 
commodation for 870 persons, but, by placing pews along, and seats 
across the passages, 60 additional sittings have been obtained. 
Upwards of a third of the sittings belong to Colonel Blair of Blair, 
though, what is peculiar, none of his tenants have any right to oc- 
cupy them, owing to the refusal of their predecessors to aid in cart- 
ing materials at their own expense for the building of the church. 
The seats are annually let by public roup to the highest bidder. 
At the erection of the church, the proprietors of Pitcon and Kers- 
land estates having agreed to give the materials of their aisles in 
the old church to aid in the erection of the new one, were allow- 
ed a proportionate number o/ sittings, amounting to about sixty each. 
The proprietors or occupiers of the soil have no right, however, to 
these sittings ; those of Kersland now belonging to the proprietor 
of the feudal superiorities, while the Pitcon sittings have fallen 
into the hands of heritors, who let them in behalf of the poor. 
The remainder of the sittings are occupied by the heritors and 
their tenants, with the exception of the table or communion seats. 
It was the original intention that the table-seats should be free, 
but the scarcity of accommodation has compelled the letting of 
these also, and the proceeds are applied to the use of the poor. 
There are now no seats properly set apart for the accommodation 
of the poor. The population having doubled since the erection of 
the present church, the accommodation which it affords has be- 
come utterly inadequate to meet the wants of the people. Every

seat is let, and, owing to the unavoidable competition, the rent of 
many of them has been trebled within these few years ; and many 
families unable to procure seats have been compelled either to ab- 
sent themselves from the public worship of God, or to take sittings 
in the dissenting chapels. Owing to the peculiar manner in which 
many of the sittings were acquired, and the mode of letting others, 
every attempt hitherto made to procure the enlargement of the 
present church, or the erection of a new one, has proved unsuc- 
cessful. We are far, however, from despairing, that the acknow- 
ledged deficiency in church accommodation, no less than the in- 
sufficient, if not dangerous, condition of the building itself, will, in 
due time, induce the heritors to erect another, not only with in- 
creased accommodation, and better adapted for the comfort of the 
parishioners, but also in a style more in unison with the wealth of 
the parish, and more in accordance with the taste of the age, than 
the present structure. 

The principal benefactions on record are, in 1810, L. 50 by Mr 
Service of Holms-of-Caaf ; in 1811, L. 40 by Mrs Hunt of Ash- 
grove ; in 1812, L. 252, 10s. by Mr John Aitken, farmer. Kirk- 
bank, parish of Johnstone, , Dumfries-shire ; in 1829, Mrs Ferguson 
of Irvine, daughter of Mr Service, bequeathed L. 50 to the poor, 
which was partly expended on oatmeal during a period of severe 
depression in trade. 

The manse was built in 1766, and has undergone extensive re- 
pairs at various periods, although it is still a damp and indifferent 
building. The yearly value of the glebe, which extends to 8 im- 
perial acres, is L. 24. The stipend  for some years has averaged 
about L. 220, with L. 10 for commupion elements. There are 
two dissenting chapels in the town ; the one attached to the United 
Secession, and the other to the Original Burghers. The minister 
of the former has L. 113, and the latter L. 80 of stipend. The 
income in both is derived from church collections and seat rents ; 
and in failure of these, from contributions levied on the 
tion. The United Secession congregation had a manse for their 
late pastor, which was sold at his death, with a view to clear off 
part of the chapel debts. The number of families belonging to 
the Established Church is 500 ; the number of persons above twelve 
years of age, who attend public worship is 1722, and of communi- 
cants 1020.

Divine service is well attended in the parish church, it being in- 
conveniently over- crowded, except on some stormy days in winter, 
when the country people cannot attend. There are no societies 
for religious purposes in the parish. The average yearly collec- 
tion for the Sabbath Schools amounts to h.7; lOs. The only 
other extraordinary collections of late years have been for the As- 
sembly's India Mission, L. 9, and for building a Gaehc chapel at 
Ardrossan, L. 8, 3s. 

Education. — Besides the parochial, there are two private schools 
in the town ; and one in the country part of the parish. The 
usual branches of instruction taught : in addition to English, writ- 
ing and arithmetic, are book-keeping, geography, Latin, Greek, 
French, and mathematics. Those taught in the private schools 
are the same as in the parochial, with the exception of the three 
last branches. The schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, 13s., with L. 2, 
2s. 9d. for deficiency of garden ground. He receives, besides, L. 5 
for acting as clerk to the heritors, and as kirk-treasurer. Taking 
into account his perquisites as session- clerk, his salary will average 
L. 40 annually. This, together with the school fees, which will fully 
exceed L. 50 yearly, would give a fair remuneration to the teacher. 
The school, however, for a number of years, has been taught by an as- 
sistant, who receives the fees, while the principal enjoys the salary. 
The expense of education is, for English Is. per month ; if writing 
and arithmetic be included. Is. 2d. per month ; and when most of 
the other branches are taught, the expense is from 18s. to L. 1, 4s'. 
per annum. It is believed that there are few of the young between 
six and fifteen years of age who cannot write, and none of the same 
age who cannot read. There are probably not half a dozen above 
fifteen who cannot read ; but there are a considerable number above 
that age who cannot write. That the people are fully alive to the 
benefits of education is evident from the fact, that, at the date of 
the last Statistical Account, the number of children at school was 
90, or one scholar to every twenty-two persons; while at pre-

sent there are 390, or one in ten, independent of tliose at evening 
schools during the winter months, and at Sabbath schools. Gra- 
tifying as this increase is, it is still far short of what it ought to be. 
Many families, containing from, five to eight children under fifteen 
years of age, keep only one child at school, while others have none 
at all. The children are sent to school at an earlier age than for- 
merly, but in the majority of cases the time during which they are 
allowed to remain is very limited. Owing to the depressed circum- 
stances of many of the manufacturing population, they are not 
only unable to defray the expense of instruction for their children 
during any length of time, but, from the same cause, are compelled 
to put them out to work at an early age, and consequently before 
their education can have advanced much beyond the mere preli- 
minary stages. 

Both the parochial and the private schools are far too confined 
for the health and comfort of the scholars. One of the private 
schools, originally a weaver's shop, 17 feet in length, by 16|wide, 
is attended by no less than 100 children. The populous district 
of Muirhouse would itself require a school for the numerous chil- 
dren it contains. 

Libraries. — There are three public libraries in the parish : 1. 
The Dairy Library was established in 181 1. The terms are 2s, 
entry money, 6d. annually, and one penny per week for every two 
volumes borrowed. The number of members is about 120. It 
contains nearly 1000 volumes. It has been of great utility in im- 
proving the minds of the community in Dairy, which has long en- 
joyed a reputation for superior intelligence among the various vil- 
lages of Ayrshire. Of late years, however, works of fiction have 
acquired an undue preponderance in the library; the object of 
many of the managers being, it is feared, not so much the selec- 
tion of books fitted to instruct, as of those which would be read 
with most avidity, and consequently would tend most to increase 
the funds of the library. 

2. The Dairy Church Library was instituted in August 1834, 
in connection with the parochial Sabbath school. The scholars 
of this school are entitled to the privilege of receiving books gratis. 
It is, besides, open to all parishioners, and to those not parishioners 
who attend the parish church, on payment of Is. per annum. It 
contains at present about 600 volumes, all exclusively religious, 
besides smaller books for the younger scholars, about 300 of whom 
receive books. The average number of subscribers is 160.

3. The congregation of the United Secession formed a Hbrary 
last year, the terms being Is. per annum to members and seat- 
holders, and 2s. to those not connected with the congregation. It 
contains about 170 volumes. It is earnestly hoped that these re- 
ligious libraries, under the guiding Providence of God, may operate 
a permanently beneficial effect on the morals and religious feelings 
of the people. 

Friendly Societies. — There are three friendly societies, having 
for their object the support of the members during sickness. 

1. The Old Friendly Society has existed since 1796 ; it has 93 
members, and a stock of L. 142, 5s. 5d., the average expenditnre 
for five years being L. 14. 

2. The Permanent Stock Friendly Society was formed in 1820 ; 
its present stock is L. 205. The expenditure has averaged L. 14, 
3s. annually for the last five years ; the members amount to 80. 
The payment to both of these societies is Is. 6d. quarterly, and 
the members receive 4s. per week if confined to bed, and 2s. 6d. 
when not confined, but unable to labour. 

3. The most important is the Free Gardener's Friendly Society. 
It was instituted in May 1820, and contains 334 members, who 
pay Is. 6d quarterly, and receive 6s". per week if bed- fast, and 4s. 
if not confined. The following is an abstract of the state of the 
funds, and the expenditure for the last ten years.

In 1831 the society was constituted agreeably to the act of Par- 
liament relating to friendly societies — and the scale of ages recom- 
mended by the Highland Society adopted. These societies have 
been of great utility in promoting industrious habits, and indepen- 
dent principles among the community, their members being in a 
great measure insured against pauperism when afflicted with dis- 
ease or old age, and unable to labour. Since the formation of 
these two last societies, the poor funds expenditure hasfor some 
years been from L. 50 to L. 60 less than the expenditure previous 
to their institution, and has, on the whole, greatly decreased. A 
female friendly society was formed two years ago, but from the

nature of its constitution — persons of sixty years of age being ad- 
mitted for 3s. of entry money — its advantages, it is feared, cannot 
be permanent. There is no saving's bank at present in the pa- 
rish ; but it is in contemplation to establish one of these valuable 
institutions. 

Poor Funds. — The average number, for seven years, of persons 
receiving aid from the parochial funds is 31, and of occasional 
poor 16. The regular poor receive from Is. 6d. to 14s. per 
month, — only one, a lunatic, is allowed the latter sum. The ave- 
rage payment to each person annually is L. 2, lis. 6d. The sum 
expended in occasional assistance is L. 13, 12s. 3d. House rents, 
L. 19, 14s. 9d. Regular poor, L. 79, 16s. lOd. Total, 
L. 113, 15s. lOd. Of the sum paid to the regular poor, about 
L. 12 is given to persons in Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Newcastle, 
who, having at some time been resident in this parish, applied for 
parochial aid before they had acquired a settlement in any other. 
The funds derived from collections at the church doors averao-e 
L. 50, lis. l,]d. annually. Interest of money, L. 10, Qs. 8d. Rents 
of church seats, L. 11. Proclamations of banns, and mortcloth 
money,t L. 8, 2s. 8d. Total, L. 80, 3s. 4d. The deficiency is 
made up by a voluntary assessment on the heritors of l|d. to 2d. 
per pound of valued rent. The poor funds being managed with 
parsimonious economy, it may be conceived that the pittance which 
the poor receive is barely adequate to sustain life, but, by the be- 
nevolence of private individuals, their condition is rendered more 
comfortable. Colonel Blair of Blair usually placed at the dispo- 
sal of the session L. 10 yearly, which was expended on clothing, 
blankets, or coals, as appeared most necessary. In the case of 
aged persons, there is generally a great reluctance discovered to 
apply for parochial aid, many persons refraining from seeking re- 
lief till utterly destitute ; and in some cases it has been necessary 
for the session almost to compel them to accept of assistance. 
This disposition soon disappears after the parties have been a few 
weeks on the roll, the object then being to procure as large an allow- 

 A few years ago, a person, a native of Maybole, came to reside in this parish, in 
which he remained three years and a few weeks, when he again returned to his na- 
tive place. After he had been nearly three years there, he applied lo the session of 
Maybole for parochial aid. They refused his application, and referred him to the 
parish of Dairy, and the session here were obliged to maintain him for a number of 
years, although, with the exception of the time he resided in this parish, he had 
always lived in his native place. 

t Some years ago, the heritors, on occasion of purchasing a new mortcloth, raised 
the dues on eacli interment to IDs. The consequence has been, that, during tlie past 
year, the whole receipt was 2s. Cd., although the dues were latterly lowered.

ance as possible, and much discontent is manifested should others 
receive a more liberal allowance than themselves. There is only 
one person in the parish who solicits public charity by means of 
begging, and who does not extend his calls beyond the town. 

Fairs. — There are six fairs held annually ; but none of them 
are of great importance. The principal fair is held on St Mar- 
garet's day, the last day of July. About forty years ago, this 
was one of the most extensive horse fairs in the west of Scotland; 
but so greatly has it degenerated, that a score of horse and two 
score of cattle would be reckoned a great fair. Some of the fairs 
have been established of late years by the publicans, ostensibly for 
the sale of cattle, lint, &amp;c. but more truly for the disposal of their 
whisky, which is always a staple commodity at fairs. From the 
trifling amount of business transacted at these fairs, and the in- 
ducements they present to dissipation, characterized, too, as they 
often are, by quarrels and brawls, they ought to be abolished, 
as nuisances detrimental to the best interests of the community. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are four inns and five public-houses in the 
parish, of which five are in the country part. Besides these, 
four of the grocers retail spirituous liquors. Their effect on the 
morals of the people is most pernicious. If we except the Largs 
road, there is no necessity for a single public-house in the country 
portion of the parish. It is doubtful whether a reduction of their 
number in the town would be of any benefit, as. such a measure 
might only tend to increase the business of the remainder. One 
cause of the prevailing intemperance is to be found in the short 
term of apprenticeships. This seldom exceeds three or. at most 
four years, and boys who are placed at trades at ten or twelve 
years of age become possessed of more money than discretion, by 
the time they are fifteen or sixteen ; and in order to sustain a cha- 
racter for manliness they resort to the public-houses, and there 
spend what ought to have gone to the support of their families. 
A temperance society was formed some years ago, and at its for- 
mation was joined by a large number of members, but these not 
being able to maintain its principles, have dwindled to a very few, 
and the society never having been countenanced by the more influ- 
ential portion of the community, has now only a nominal existence. 

Fuel. — Coals are the chief fuel consumed. Peats are used on- 
ly in the vicinity of the mosses, or in small quantities, by the inha- 
bitants of the towns to kindle their fires. Coals are sold at the

pits at 3s. the cart load, and laid down in Dairy at 3s. 8d. and 4s. 
per cart, or 4s. 9d. per ton. 

Miscellaneous Oibservations. 

Since the publication of the former Statistical Account, the po- 
pulation has nearly doubled, and the rent of the parish has increas- 
ed from L. 6350 to L, 17,712. A great extent of moss waste 
land has been brought under cultivation. New roads have been 
formed, and the old ones greatly improved. Several hundred acres 
of land have been planted, and are now thriving plantations. Fur- 
row-draining has been most extensively practised. Improved farm 
steadings have been erected, and are still increasing. Improved 
implements of husbandry have been introduced ; iron ploughs have 
entirely superseded those of wood ; and the old cumbrous stone 
cheese-presses have given place to the iron lever press, a portable 
and neatly constructed article. 

The Ardrossan canal was destined to have passed through this 
parish. But having been finished only from Glasgow to John- 
stone, an act of Parliament was obtained in 1825, to complete the 
communication from Johnstone to Ardrossan by a rail-road. It has 
only, however, been carried from Ardrossan to Kilwinning. As it 
would have passed, had it been completed, for six miles through 
Dairy, intersecting extensive fields of coal, limestone, and free- 
stone, it would have proved of essential benefit to the parish. A 
survey was lately taken of a rail-road from Glasgow to Ayr by Dai- 
ry, for which the requisite funds have been subscribed. It is pro- 
bable, therefore, that this-parish will ere long enjoy the advantages 
of this mode of communication.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. THOMAS FINDLAY, MINISTER . 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — Kilbride, the ancient as well as present name of this 
parish, is obviously derived from St Bryde, a virgin of great cele- 
brity in the Scotch Kalendar, to whom the church was dedicated; 
and on whose anniversary or festival, on the 1st day of February, 
a fair, called Brydsday, has immemorially been held at the village 
or kirk-town. •}• 

Topographical Appearances and Boundaries. — The parish of 
Kilbride, terminating the far projecting coast of Cuningham to the 
westward, is finely situated on the shores of the Frith of Clyde, 
where that noble estuary suddenly expands itself immediately be- 
low the two Cumbrays. Towards the sea, the general appearance 
is green and fertile, yet much diversified and broken by steep banks 
and eminences of considerable height ; whilst inland, the view is 
closed by a range of dusky moorland hills. In length, it is 
about 6 miles ; its medium breadth may be about 2, where 
broadest, perhaps Q\ miles, extending in all to about 8650 acres 
Scotch measure, exclusive of the Island of Little Cumbray. This 
parish is bounded on the north by the parish of Largs ; on the east 
and south-east, by those of Dairy and Ardrossan respectively ; south 
and west, it is washed by the sea ; the general figure being trian- 

 This Account has been drawn up by John Fullarton, Esq., an heritor in the pa- 
rish. 

f That this fair was originally kept on the first day of the month is confirmed by 
Font's Topography of Cuningham, MS. temp. James VI. In latter times the day 
has been changed to the second Tuesday. Fairs on festival days invariably originat- 
ed with the clergy, who derived certain, emoluments from them ; and they were 
usually celebrated within the church and its precincts. In this place, the travelling 
merchants or packmen, even within the present century, continued to exhibit their 
wares within the church-yard. The general position of parish churches, near the 
northern boundary of their inclosures, may have had some reference to the purpose 
of these fairs. 

\ Scotch measure is invariably alluded to in this Account.

gular. A chain of pretty high hills, gradually declining, however, 
tX, and terminating with its southern limits, runs along its whole 
inland boundary, occupying, perhaps, fully one-fourth of its super- 
ficies. This is a continuation of the hilly western part of Ren- 
frewshire, and intervening parish of Largs. Kame hill, the high- 
est of the range, here rises nearly 1000 feet above the sea-mark, 
from which it almost immediately springs. From these again are 
deflected to the westward several eminences of considerable alti- 
titude, though cultivated pretty far up ; others stand quite detach- 
ed, as those of Law, Ardneill, Tarbert, and some lesser heights 
in the vicinity of the village. Of the arable lands towards the 
coast, about 2000 acres consist of alluvial formations, but little 
elevated above the level of the sea, varying from a few feet to 
about 40. SiDme fissures or openings occur in the rocks near 
Portincross, as likewise in the Island of Little Cumbray, as aiter- 
wards to be noticed. 

From its peninsulated figure, this parish has the advantage of an 
increased line of coast, in all extending to perhaps upwards ofseven 
miles. The shore is low and shelving, consisting of alternate sandy 
bays and reefs of sandstone, except for about a mile at the pro- 
montory of Portincross, which is steep and rocky. To the north, 
the sands of Southanan, lying in a deep and sheltered curvature, 
extend fully two miles in length, and from which the tide recedes 
for nearly a mile in the centre. This fine plain, consisting of a 
soil in some degree adhesive, largely intermixed with shells, it 
has been suposed, might be embanked and reclaimed for culti- 
vation; but the expense of such an undertaking, if at all practi- 
cable, will probably ever preclude the attempt being made. These 
sands are frequented by immense flocks of wild fowl, chiefly of the 
duck tribe, and contain likewise large beds of cockles and mussels, 
besides other varieties of shell-fish, as the clam, &amp;c. Next south- 
ward lies the promontory of Portincross, which is terminated by 
the celebrated precipice called Ardneil Bank, in some old writings 
" Goldberrie head."  This majestic wall of rock, rising where 
highest to perhaps little less than 300 feet perpendicularly, ranges 
in a straight line along the water's edge, from which it is merely 
separated by a narrow slip of green land, and extends to about a 
mile in length. Along the bottom, the precipice is richly fringed 

' " Goudberric head, are grate heigh rockes, making a headland, and running in

with natural coppice, in which the oak, ash, hazel, and hawthorn, 
are thickly interwoven ; upwards, the glossy ivy is widely spread, 
whilst gray lichens intermixed with large patches of a bright gold- 
en-colour succeed, lining the bold front to its outmost verge. 
Viewed from the plain below, the effect is highly impressive and 
sublime ; whilst to approach its terrific summit, the vivid descrip- 
tion by Shakspeare of the cliff of Dover is fully realized. The 
general massof these stupendous rocksconsists of dark-red sandstone, 
lying horizontally ; but for a considerable space where highest, the 
sandstone about midway up is surmounted by a beautiful brown por- 
phyry. This portion, dividing itself into three distinct and deeply 
separated cliffs of equal height and uniform appearance, has imme- 
morially obtained the poetical cognomen of the Three Sisters, other- 
wise three Jeans, perhaps iv'wns and truly it were notdifficultin then- 
stately and solemn austerity to conceive a fanciful resemblance to the 
veiled sisterhood of superstitious observance.  On the south side 
of this promontory lies Ardneill bay, a beautiful sandy crescent, 
which affords an agreeable promenade and easy access for bathing 
to those in search of health or recreation : others similar, though of 
less extent, succeed in the same direction, and terminate the shore 
southward. 

Climate and Diseases.— The prevailing character of the climate 
in this quarter is moist and cloudy, with south and westerly winds. 
Generally, however, it is mild and salubrious, and the tempera- 
ture for the most part pretty equable. This state of the weather 
may constitute fully one-half of the season ; and under it the in- 
habitants are, perhaps, not less healthful than during the hot and 
arid periods, which not unfrequently occur in the summer and har- 
vest months, the transition being often to a considerable degree 
sudden and excessive. There does not appear to be any very 
marked peculiarity of disease here. Rheumatism occasionally ap- 
pears, though certainly not to any great extent; but peripneumony 
not unfrequently closes the scene with the aged. Fever has not 
often been marked by any peculiar severity f diseases of the phthi- 
sical class are, perhaps, here, as in most parts of the country, great- 

 According to tradition, diamonds were contained in this part of the precipice ; 
and which, it is said, have been seen by fishermen on the sea at night shining like stars 
in the face of the rock. Symson relates a similar talc of the Mull of Galloway, in 
his Account of that district. " Such says he as sail by it in a dark night have ob- 
served a great light, which hath occasioned some to say, that there is a rock of dia- 
monds there." The tradition of the diamond, indeed, is common in many similar 
inaccessible places in other quarters.

Jy more to be feared. Epilepsy is by no means of frequent occur- 
rence, and small-pox for a long time past has been but little heard 
of,— parents happily having long since got over their " dread of po- 
pular odium, or their own superstitious opinions."  

Hydrography.— 0 medicinal waters, with- the exception of 
slight chalybeate impregnations, have ever been discovered in this 
place. Neither are there any lakes or rivers properly so called. 
The more considerable streamlets are, Gourock, Kilbride, an- 
ciently Millburn, Southannan and Fairly burns, which all have 
their source within or near the eastern limits of the parish, and fkll 
into the Frith westward. Southannan is distinguished by its pic- 
turesque cascade and beautiful sylvan banks. Of the others, there 
is nothing very notable to remark, except that, like the latter, they 
have all in former times been employed in driving corn-mills, as 
that of Kilbride the only one still continues to be used. Excel- 
lent and copious springs very much abound ; the largest and purest 
perhaps is that of Dornell-well, on the farm of South Kilruskin. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The general basis here consists of 
coarse sandstone, declining about a foot in twenty to the south- 
east. The strata which come into view along the sea shore are 
chiefly brown or reddish ; higher up it becomes clouded with white, 
whilst the highest of all to the eastward are wholly of the latter 
colour, a good deal tinged and streaked- with ochre of iron. Nu- 
merous extensive veins of whin rock, both of the basaltic and por- 
phyritic kinds, intersect it in all directions ; in some parts bulgino- 
out into considerable hills, which, of course, are all distinguished 
by their rounded figures, and beautiful verdure. The brown slate 
porphyry before alluded to forms the summits of several conside- 
rable hills, as those of Crosby and others, whilst Kame hill, of still 
greater altitude, is crowned with dark trap of perhaps 200 feet in 
thickness. Slight veins of lime appear at Ardneill point, on the 
shore and other places, but seemingly far too limited and impure 
ever to be of any avail. At the south end of Ardneill bank, is a ' 
very remarkable stratum of puddingstone, the rolled fragments of 
which, being at places of considerable size, and the cementing me- 
dium bearing striking marks of fusion. This stratum lies nearly 
north and south, dipping pretty acutely westward. It rises near- 

 Only one distinct case of cholera occurred here during the alarming epidemic 
of 1832, and it proved fatal. The individual was emploj'ed as a carrier to Glasgow, 
where he appears to have caught the infection. In 1835, small-pox reajipeared to a 
considerable extent, and of which two or three persons of middle age have died.

ly to the summit of the precipice, and in it is a lavg openmg or 
fissure, called the " cove," long tenanted by the usual creations of 
popular fancy,-" fairies and the elfin train." Slight veins of dif- 
ferent kinds of spar occur, and in the trap formations rock crystals 
have been found ; but neither coal nor any metallic ore ot any 
value have ever been met with. As stated in the former account, 
there is a quarry of excellent millstones, situated on Kame hiil. 
These are formed from a stratum of breccia— white sandstone, mi- 
nutely intermixed with quartz,— which occurs near the summit ot 
the hill, immediately under the trap formation before alluded to. 
The number of millstones annually produced is about thirty. They 
are esteemed of excellent quaUty, are taken to a great distance at 
home, and some few are exported. 

Soz7.— Generally, the soil of this parish may be divided into two. 
classes : that which hes on the original formations of the more ele- 
vated parts, and secondly, that which covers the alluvial plains by 
the coast side, and in the valley bottoms. Of the first, which may 
comprehend nearly four-fifths of the whole, a considerable part 
even within the arable range consists of poor spongy moorish land, 
thin, cold, and ungenial, incumbent on a coarse tilly and imper- 
vious foundation. There are nevertheless in this division many 
portions of very kindly land, of the loamy and calcareous species, 
chiefly around the bases of the hills and rising grounds. Part of 
the alluvial division is of a deep dark mould of the finest quality, 
but still a very large proportion degenerates into a poor hungry 
corroding gravel, whilst a narrow stripe by the sea side consists of 
arid burning sand. A considerable extent of moss or peat bogs 
is interspersed in the moorish parts; and in the valley behind Ard- 
neill hills, near the coast, there is a fine field of this sort, extend- 
ing in all to perhaps 150 acres, which has recently been advanta- 
geously reclaimed and cultivated. 

Wherever the sandstone formation prevails, the hills are general- 
ly covered with heath, of which there are several varieties. On 
those hills, composed of whin rock, and on the dry gravelly soils 
by the coast side, furze greatly predominates, with a little broom ; 
whilst the arable fields in these quarters suffer much from what is 
termed here the runch — Raphaimm raplianistrum. 

Zoology. — From the names of several places, such as Wildcat- 
road and Catcraigs, the native cat would seem at some time to 
have been a common inhabitant of this neighbourhood. But the 



2'18 AYRSHIRE. 

race is probcably now exterminated. On the coast, the seal and 
otter are still pretty numerous ; and the badger yet maintains his 
footing, especially in his stronghold of Ardneill Bank. Hares and 
the more common species of game are numerous ; and rabbits are 
thinly sprinkled over many places ; but no quadruped which may 
strictly be reckoned uncommon possibly exists here. The falcon 
or goshawk has immemorially found a suitable retreat for her eyrie 
in the clilfs of Ardneill Bank. The young can only be obtained 
by letting a person down over the rocks by means of ropes, which 
has sometimes been done. 

Fisheries.— W\th the exception of a few trout found in the 
streamlets, fishing here is confined to the sea. Herring are oc- 
casionally taken in considerable quantities, but are too uncertain 
to induce any regular pursuit of them. The other species of fish 
usually found are, cod, whiting, mackerel, lythe and saithe, but 
except the last none of them are often very plentiful. A few lobsters 
are caught in their season, which are sent to the Glasgow market,, 
chiefly by the steam-boats which pass this way.  

Woods and Plantations.— There is a general want of wood in 
this parish, in great part the consequence of long absenteeism 
among its proprietors ; and assuredly nothing could equally contri- 
bute to its improvement, as the liberal and judicious introduction 
of sylvan embellishments in it. In particular, its absence in the 
vicinity of the sea is signally felt, where, of course, utility not less 
than just taste requires that it should be supplied with no sparing 
hand. The many steep banks, ravines, and hill faces, as well as 
portions of thin and broken land, which occur everywhere, are 
situations exceedingly fitting for such purposes. The extent of 
woods of all sorts does not probably exceed 150 acres, of which 
about one-third may be natural coppice ; the rest mixed planta- 
tions of fir and hardwood, mostly of no great age. Unfortunately, 

 Fishing, on the whole, has not for a long time been either extensive or profit- 
able here. Its former importance has been very fully and properly alluded to in the 
first Account. There can be no doubt it was long a main dependence of the people 
here, and that its declension, as there surmised, may have affected the population. 
The many little " boat-ports," all less or more the work of art, still to be observed, 
clearly indicate the fact. Herring appear to have been a common stipulation in the 
payment of land-rent. In the Commissary Records of Glasgow, a tenant in Fairly, 
at his decease, I60I, is indebted to " the Lady Fairly, twa hundrith half-hundrith 
mail herring ;" another in Largs owes " the Lady Robertland sax thousand salt her- 
ring, pryce of the thousand vj 11. to be payit yeirlie betwixt Yuill and Candlmes,"&amp;c. 
And in the minutes of the session .the following notice, amongst many otliers illus- 
trative of this subject, occurs :— June 18, 1718, tlic session resolve that the sacrament 
" behoved to be before tiic middle of July because of the Iierring fishers."

the little which has been planted is generally too much in the back- 
ground, — a notion having prevailed that trees would not thrive ad- 
jacent to the sea, which no doubt is in some degree correct, though 
by no means greatly to be regarded, as some experiments have 
fully shew-n. The hard-wood tribes seem best suited to maritime 
situations ; and of these the Scotch elm, plane, ash, beech, and 
oak appear to answer best here. But much depends on the na- 
ture of the subsoil. For the most part the fir species soon lan- 
guish on sour or tilly foundations. Every care should be had to 
preserve the westerly skirts close and compact ; not, however, by 
too thick planting, a common error. This will best be secured 
by introducing only the hardiest kinds, cautious thinning, and by 
allowing each plant to spread to its greatest dimensions, and to 
retain its branches as low down as possible. Nor should thorough 
draining and cultivation of the soil, where required, ever be omitted. 

Some fine old trees still grow at the ruins of Southanan or Un- 
derbank, though latterly a great deal have been cut down. These 
were chiefly ash, plane, and Scotch elm ; and part of a row of lime 
trees yet remain, of exceeding stately growth and beauty. The 
situation is on a narrow plain by the margin of the sea, under the 
cover of high and steep banks ; the soil a rich brown loam on 
sandstone. At the old house of Crosby, there is a plantation of 
beeches, of perhaps 150 years' growth; but though of goodly 
height, the trees are deficient in girth, not having been properly 
thinned. These occupy a deep and narrow ravine in sandstone. 
There is likewise some old timber at Hunterston, and formerly 
there was more, which stands on an open sandy plain close by the 
sea bpach. The trees here are chiefly ash, and said to be of ex- 
cellent quality. In former times, most of the farm-houses, or toions, 
as they were called, were encircled by venerable ash and plane 
trees. Some of these still remain to enrich the locality, and mark 
the site of these immemorial homesteads of the original possessors 
of the soil ; but very many of the finest have fallen under the reck- 
less hand of cupidity or Gothic barbarity.

11. — Civil History. 

Kilbride appears originally to have been a dependency of the 
monastery of Kilwinning, and the cure to have been served by a 
vicar, — the monks drawing the rectorial tithes. Since the dissolu- 
tion of the Catholic establishment, its boundaries have been alter- 
ed, and probably enlarged. About the year 1650, the extensive 
properties of Southanan and Crosby were disjoined from Largs, 
and annexed quoad omnia to Kilbride ; on the other hand, the 
lands of Monfode, Knockewart, and Boydston, were separated from 
it, and adjoined to the parish of Ardrossan on the south, the two 
first quoad omnia, the last only quoad sacra. 

This neighbourhood, with some probability, is said to have. been 
the scene of conflicts consequent on the Norwegian descent at 
Largs in 1263 ; and doubtless it was exposed to much previous 
strife with these fierce northern marauders. At the hill of Gold- 
berry, before alluded to, tradition asserts, that a detachment of 
the army of Haco was attacked and routed by a body of Scotch- 
men, led by Sir Robert Boyd, who is said to have been the pro- 
genitor of the family of Kilmarnock, and for these services to have 
received a grant of some lands in Cuninghara. From the time of 
this affair, which seems finally to have terminated these long pro- 
tracted incursions of this restless people, the western shores ever 
■ after enjoyed perhaps a greater degree of quiet than that of almost 
any other district of the country. They continued, however, to

contribute to the common defence of the kingdom. The family of' 
Kihnarnock, which from about this era rose to be among the most 
considerable of the barons of the west, was mainly advanced by the 
services of Sir Robert Boyd in the cause of Bruce : Besides ex- 
tensive grants of land elsewhere, he obtained from that monarch 
the estates of Kilbride and Ardneill, in this parish, and which were 
long held by his descendants. 

In the unhappy carnage of Pinkie in 1547, the west country 
appears to have had but too considerable a share. From Kil- 
bride, the lairds of Hunterston and Monfode fell in the fray. 
Again at the field of Langside, from their wide dependence 
on the Lord Boyd, great numbers from this quarter were pre- 
sent on the side of the Queen. E-obert Boyd of Portincross, 
and his eldest son, Archibald, with a great many others of 
their name, afterwards obtained remissions for their appearance 
on that occasion. Nothing, however, appears to shew that this 
parish can claim any distinguished place amongst those "patriotic 
bands," who so greatly exalted the name of Scotchmen, by the 
noble stand they made in the cause of civil and religious liberty 
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, though it is hardly 
to be doubted, many individuals, however lowly in place, must 
have shared in that fervour of spirit which shone so conspicuously 
throughout the west during that memorable period of the national 
history. As before noticed, the family of Kilmarnock had much 
influence here ; and the part which that family ever acted in pub- 
lic affairs, if v/e except the services of their founder in the cause 
of Bruce, was not certainly such as in any way to entitle them to 
the respect or sympathy of their countrymen. The whole of the 
church lands here, which were considerable, were unequally shar- 
ed betwixt Alexander, the " good" Earl of Glencairn, and Lord 
Boyd.  

Of the unfortunate smuggling traffic which ensued on the union 
of this country with England, the inhabitants of this parish were 
unhappily long and deeply participant. Many traces of this de- 
moralizing pursuit may still be found in the records of its session, 

• The following characteristic anecdote, relative to this parish, is preserved in 
Crawfurd's Genealogical Collections in the 'Advocates' Library. " Mr Georo-e Cr-iw 
furd, a son ot Thirdpart, was minister at Kilbryde. He was deposed in tJie strick 
times of the Covenant for wardly mindedncss and selling a horse on the Sabbath 
day, as old Portincross Robert Boyd of Portincross, ' who dyed veiy aged near 
100 years of age, in 171.'— Ibidem. told me, who knew him minister at Kilbryde 
and was a witness against him at the presbytery." '

and of which a few specimens, for the gratification of the curious, 
are here subjoined. 

Eminent Men. — As a talented scholar, the most eminent person 
connected with this parish was Dr Robert Simson of Glasgow, 
the well-known translator of Euclid. Dr Srmson's progenitors 
had been long resident here, and at a pretty early period acquired 
some lands near the village, to which they gave the name of Kirk- 
tonhall, and to which in succession the Doctor himself succeeded. 
In the garden of this residence of his predecessors, there still re- 
mains a curious sun-dial, understood to have been designed by this 
eminent mathematician ; it is inscribed with his father's and mo- 
ther's initials, and the date 1717. Yet it would seem doubtful 
after all if Dr Simson was born at this place. His father, John 
Simson of Kirktonhall, was bred a merchant in Glasgow, and en- 
tered as a member of the merchant's house there in 1683; and 
in about two years afterwards, married Agnes, daughter of the 
Rev. Patrick Simson, minister of Renfrew. Of this linion, which 
produced the remarkable issue of seventeen sons without any 
daughters, the Doctor was the eldest, being born October 14, 1687. 
He was educated at the university of Glasgow, under the care of 
his maternal uncle, the Rev. John Simson, Professor of Divinity 
there.f In 1711, he was appointed to the mathematical chair of 
his alma mater, it being tendered to him without any solicitation 
on his part ; and in this situation, he continued for the long space 
of fifty-eight years, " with inci-easing reputation to himself, and 
great advantage to the university." He published many works 
on his favourite science which he professed, and in these has 
left " a monument of great genius and intellectual ability." 
Having nearly completed his eighty-first year, this distinguish-

came up to take brandy on that day, &amp;c. -.t o i

ed vindicator of the ancient geometers died at Glasgow, October 
1, 1768, and was interred there in the Blackfriars burying-ground, 
where is placed to his memory a plain marble tablet, bearing an 
elaborate Latin inscription. Never having been married, Dr Sim- 
son was succeeded in his property of Kirktonhall and others by a 
grand-nephew of his own name, who afterwards disposed of it. In 
the year 1812, Dr Trail of Belfast published an account of the 
life and writings of Dr Simson ; and there is a portrait of him 
placed in the public hall of the college of which he was so distin- 
guished a member. 

The late General Robert Boyd, Lieutenant-governor of Gibral- 
ter during the memorable siege of that fortress in 1782, derived 
his origin from the parish of Kilbride. His parents, who were but 
of the class of small farmers, however, having removed to the 
burgh of Irvine, it has been assumed that the General was born 
there. However this may be, he went first to sea in a coasting- 
vessel out of that port, was impressed into the navy, afterwards 
became a soldier, and, by a life of extraordinary perseverance in 
the exercise of great talents, rose to the distinguished station 
which he ultimately filled with the highest reputation and honour. 

It has likewise been alleged that the illustrious Mr John Hun- 
ter, whose labours have so eminently enlarged the bounds of phy- 
sical science, was remotely descended from the Hunters of Hun- 
terston in this parish ; but the evidence of this circumstance, which 
of course cannot in any way be necessary to the fame or reputa- 
tion of such a man, seems to be but of an uncertain nature. 

Division of Land. — This parish, as at present constituted, is 
properly divided into seven estates, here called baronies ; which 
disposition of its territory is probably coeval with the arrangements 
which arose out of the new settlement under Robert the Bruce. 
These are as follows : 

1. Southanan, the most extensive of the whole, belonged from the 
time of Bruce to the family of Sempil ; but was alienated towards 
the close of the seventeenth century, and now belongs to Lady 
Mary Montgomery Lamb. The Sempils had here a splendid 
villa at Underbank, the ruins of which still remain. At this 
place, " John, Lord Semple, in . the time of James IV. built a 
chapel, dedicated to St Inan ; and to which his Lordship granted, 
for the support of a chaplain in it, an annual-rent of ten marks out 
of the lands of Meikle and Little Kilruskan, with two smoms of 
pasturage in the Mains of Southanan ; and an acre of land on the

north side of the cemetery, for the chaplain's manse : confirmed, 
1509." The beautifully wooded and monastic place of Under- 
bank is now occupied as the site of a cottage ornee, built close bv 
the ruins of the ancient mansion. 

2. Crosby, adjoining Southanan, comprehends a pretty exten- 
sive portion of hill land, lying along the east side of the parish, 
and abounds in moor game. This property belongs to John 
Crawfurd of Auchnames, whose ancestor acquired it from his 
connections, the original family, of the same name and designation, 
about the beginning of last century. There is a small mansion- 
house on it, erected near the end of the seventeenth century, which 
was long ruinous, but is now being restored in good taste by the 
proprietor. Crosby was an ancient inheritance of the Crawfurds 
of Lowdon, sheriffs of Ayr, and there seems great probability that 
it was at the original " Tower of Crosby" that the hero of Scot- 
land, Wallace, found refuge with his uncle. Sir Ronald Craw- 
furd, during his outlawry by the English authorities. This inci- 
dent, if is true, has often been assigned to Crosby in Kyle, but, 
there seems great reason to think, erroneously. Crosby in Cunning- 
ham is uniformly contradistinguished from the other as " Crosby- 
Crawfurd" in all early writings; and the intelhgent Chalmers, 
speaking of Crosby in Kyle, distinctly states it to have " belong- 
ed to the family of Fullarton in the twelfth century, and probably 
from an earlier age." . 

3. Kilbride, which, as before-observed, along with Ardneill, 
was conferred by the renowned Bruce on the ancestor of the Earls 
of Kilmarnock. There are still remaining here the walls of a very 
stately tower, called Lawcastle, quite entire. It is beautifully si- 
tuated on a step, an eminence overlooking the village, and com- 
mands delightful prospects of the islands and frith to the west- 
ward. In 1670, William, third Earl of Kilmarnock, ahenated 
this estate, along with the lands of Drummilling and Boydston to 
a Major Hugh Bontine, who, it is said, acquired his fortune in 
the service of the Commonwealth. From his heirs, the Baillies 
of Monkton, the whole was judicially sold in 1759, with the ex-

of William Craufurd of Auchnaims, by divers thought to be cheiffe of the Crau- 
furds. Ho holds tlie same of the Earls of Glencairnc. This surname is very an- 
cient, and did memorable service under King Alexander the 3d, at the batell of Lar. 
gis, by quhome their good service wes recompensed with divers great lands and pos- 
scssiones. According to the old common rithme, 

They had Draffen, Methwcine, and rich erth Stevinstone ; 
Caineltounc, Knockawart, and fair Lowdoune."

ception of some small portions previously alienated in a variety of 
lots, as it still remains. 

5. Carlung and Drummilling both church lands. Carlung-, 
which is a ten pund land, and very valuable, belonged to the col- 
legiate kirk of Kilmawrs, and at the Reformation fell to the share 
of Alexander Earl of Glencairn ; the other, of far inferior extent 
and value, -which probably belonged to the monastery of Kilwin- 
ning, was given to Lord Boyd, a man of very opposite sentiments 
to those of the " good" Earl ; but something conciliatory, no doubt, 
then, as now, was necessary to be observed in matters of state pohcy. 
Both properties lie in the immediate vicinity of the village, and have 
long since been alienated and parcelled out. Carlung, which was 
for several generations the seat of a cadet of the family of Glen- 
cairn, is now separated into four distinct properties, Carlung, Wood- 
side, Kirktonhall, and Overtoun. 

6. Ardneill or Portincross. From the ancient fortalice of 
Portincross, the chief messuage of this estate, the proprietors ap- 
pear invariably to have been designed. About the time of Robert 
II. Ardneill became the patrimony of a third son of the Boyd fa- 
mily, and it continued with his descendants, the Boyds of Portin- 
cross, to the year 1737, when it was alienated to the ancestor of 
the present proprietor, John Crawfurd of Auchnames, who has a 
neat cottage residence close by the old castle. The castle of Por- 
tincross, the walls of which are yet pretty entire, though long ruin- 
ous, is perhaps the most ancient structure of the kind now remain- 
ing in this place. It stands on a ledge of rock projecting into the 
sea under the bold promontory to which it gives name, a singular- 
ly wild and romantic situation. Several royal charters of the two 
first Stewart Kings bear to have received the sign-manual at " Ar- 
nele," which unquestionably refers to this fortlet, and which has 
led to a notion, that Portincross had been at that period a royal 
residence of the Kings of Scotland. But there seems no evidence 
whatever to conclude it ever was such in the proper sense of the 

 One of the original purchasers, a Mr Alexander Fairy, who had acquired a di- 
vision of rather indifferent land, which he named Springside, soon after began a re- 
gular system of improvement on it, enclosing, draining, and planting, which he very 
successfully completed ; and was one of the earliest improvers here. Mr Boyd of Car- 
lung, who had spent his early life at New York, in North America, was contemporary 
witii Mr Fairy, and equally energetic in enclosing and improving his lands, which 
on his succession he found in the most barbarous condition. There had been consi- 
derably earlier attempts of this nature on the estates of Crosby and Ardneill ; but these 
had not been followed up, and by this time were wholly neglected, the lands having 
been turned into grazings. Springside is now ttic property of Mr John Blair Ilynd- 
man, whose style of improvements is hardly equal to that of his spirited predecessor.

term. The probability is, that these sovereigns, in passing to and 
from Dundonald in Kyle, and Rothesay in Bute, had been in use 
to cross the channel at this point, and may occasionally, as cir- 
cumstances or inclinations suggested, have prolonged their stay a 
little at this convenient station. Contemplating the narrow vk'alls 
of this sea-beat tower, it is certainly difficult to conceive it should 
ever have afforded accommodation to the prestige of a royal court ; 
yet when we reflect on the circumscribed nature of even Dundon- 
ald itself, the favourite residence of these same sovereigns, the 
contrast by no means appears so very extraordinary.  

7. The last of these " baronies" is the estate of Hunterston, 
the property of Mrs Hunter of Hunterston ; and which is the 
only portion of the parish which has remained unalienated from 
ancient times. Crawfurd, the author of the Peerage, states, that 
this fa:jiily have had " at least a part of the estate they still pos- 
sess as far back as the reign of King Alexander II." ' However 
this may be, it is clear that this family are very ancient possessors 
here ; for from the records of the Great Seal it appears, that Wil- 
liam Hunter of Hunterston obtained a confirmation of the lands 
of Campbelton, part of Ardneill adjoining, so early as the time of 
Robert II., and which lands still remain in the family. The ori- 
ginal mansion-house of Hunterston, part of which consists of a 
square tower, evidently of ancient construction, though of very li- 
mited dimensions, is still kept habitable, being occupied as a farm- 
house; a handsome new mansion having been erected by the pro- 
prietor about thirty years ago, a little way nearer the sea. The 
old fortlet occupied originally a narrow tongue of land jutting into 
a deep morass, which of course constituted its security from ex- 
ternal aggression. But whilst modern improvements have turned 
the bogs into fruitful fields, the little " lonely tower" has thus 
been reft of its characteristic defence. Many little patches have 
from time to time been added to this olden dwelling, and which, 
being closely environed by aged trees, has altogether a very antique 
and picturesque appearance. 

The whole of these properties, with the exception of Kilbride 
and Carlung, which have been parcelled out as before noticed, are 
now, it is understood, under the fetters of strict entails, all of com- 
paratively recent date. For notwithstanding the pernicious effects 

 In an inventory of the effects within the fortalice of Portincross, taken in 1621, 
it appears infer alia to have contained " teu fedder beddis," with their furnishings, 
which is so far illustrative of the manners of those times ; for it is clear two or three 
of these must have belonged to each chamber.

of such restrictions, as well to the possessors themselves, as to the 
public interest, the owners of property still cling with an undimi- 
nished fondness to this no less injurious than absurd and prepos- 
terous practice in the disposal of their lands. Difficulties of no 
ordinary kind undoubtedly have ever stood in the way of undoing 
the past ; but that government could not be said to discharge its 
proper and bounden duty, which, when such erroneous pohcy came 
to manifest itself through its consequences, did not instantly put a 
stop to its further baneful operations. So long as this barbarous 
remnant of the spirit of feudalism is suffered to exist, it is obvious, 
all future ameliorations of the soil must be circumscribed to an 
incalculable extent. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of this parish commence 
pretty early, are very complete, and in good preservation ; cer- 
tainly much more so than is usually the case with such documents. 
The register of births begins November 6, 1691, and is regularly 
continued to the present time. It is to be noted, however, of this 
record, that at no time has the law been uniformly complied with, 
many births never having been entered at all; which of course very 
much lessens its value to the community. The registry of mar- 
riages is continued from 1693, and is preserved entire. Minutes of 
the kirk -session commence February 15, 1716, and now occupy 
nearly two thick quarto volumes. Money accounts in reference 
to the poor are preserved from 1730 to the present time ; and 
minutes of the meetings of heritors separately since 1795. 

Antiquities, — Some traces of remote times still exist here. 
Along the steep banks facing the sea-beach are placed a chain of 
little round eminences called " Castle hills," supposed to be the 
remains of a very primitive class of fortlets. They stand at un- 
equal distances, apparently as suitableness of situation offered — 
some scarcely half a mile, others a mile and a half apart. In par- 
ticular, they occur at Boydston, Glenhead, Seamill, and Ardneill. 
They are all constructed in the same manner, and are of very li- 
mited dimensions. A portion of the bank is detached on all sides 
and rounded conically ; the enclosure on the summit, of about 30 
or 40 feet in diameter, is surrounded by a rampart from 6 to 
8 feet in thickness, faced on both sides with large undressed 
stones neatly laid, the interstice being filled up with small stones 
intermixed with earth. That at Ardneill stands on a finely isolated 
eminence called Auldhill, and in front of the enclosure or praeto- 
rium, there is an esplanade of 40 or 50 paces in length, very er

actly formed and levelled. Something similar exists at Seamill, 
but the rest are confined to the circular rampart alone. Conjec- 
ture assigns these structures to the era of the Danish incursions, 
which seems not improbable ; but they may belong to a still higher 
antiquity. Tumuli have likewise been accidenially explored here, 
in which were found urns containing calcined human bones and 
ashes. Near the Castlehill, at Seamill, about four years ago, 
whilst the new Une of the coast road was being executed, two 
entire urns of this sort were dug out in a stratum of gravel, about 
three feet below the surface, but without the addition of any 
mound being raised over them. One of these, it is believed, has 
since been deposited in Anderson's Institution in Glasgow. These 
urns were formed of coarse red clay, of very rude manufacture, 
yet well proportioned and modelled in the vase form. In harden- 
ing, the fire appears to have been applied solely to the inside of 
the urn, that part being changed to a dark colour, whilst the out- 
side remains of the natural red. A short time ago, a splendid an- 
tique siver brooch, of large size, richly ornamented with filigree 
work, and bearing a Runic inscription, was found near Hunter- 
ston ; a description with drawings of which, it is said, is in prepara- 
tion for the Transactions of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries. 

One of the large ships of the celebrated Spanish armada of 
1588, after the dispersion of thait formidable fleet, having found 
her way into the Firth of Clyde, ultimately perished close by the 
castle of Portincross. " She sunk in about ten fathom water, at no 
great distance from the shore," on a clean firm sandy bottom. 
Tradition affirms that part of the crew were saved, and it seems 
not improbable that most of them might get to land. In De Foe's 
Tour, Vol. iv. ed. 1779, there is an interesting account of an at- 
tempt to recover property out of this vessel, by means of a diving 
machine, in the year 1 740. A good many brass and iron ordnance 
were obtained from the wreck, which were all carried off except 
one of iron, which still lies on the beach beside the old castle ; 
and on which may still be faintly traced the Spanish crown and 
arms near the breech of the piece.f 

 A few years tiro, an opening being made in the ground outside of the rampart 
at Seamill, a considerable quantity of charcoal of wood, bones of cattle and deers' 
horns, some of which appearing to have been sawn asunder, were found a few feet 
below the surface, the materials of the wall having fallen down over the place. 

t In the legends of the place, the sinking of this ship is ascribed to the spells of a 
noted witch of the neighbourhood, Geils Buchanan, who, mounting the brow of the 
promontory and twirling her spindle, with the lengtllening thread the hapless voyagers 
sunk, down.

III. — Population. 
That the population of this parish at a former period experien- 
ced a very remarkable decrease, there can be no manner of doubt. 
The following particulars relative to this head have been as- 
certained with much care and accuracy by Mr Smith, our pre- 
sent excellent parochial teacher ; and they certainly afford a cu- 
rious and interesting view of the subject. From the register of 
births, it appears that, from 1692 to 1718, inclusive, a period of 
twenty-seven years, the annual average number of births was 42 ; 
for five years subsequent to 1801, the population being 795, these 
registrations average 19| ; and during five years preceding 1831, 
population 1684, the annual average of births was 5 If. So that tak- 
ing these data and criteria, the average population from 1692 to 
1718, must have stood about 1373, 

According to Dr Webster, the population here in 1 775 was - 885 

in 1793, as in the former Account, 698

That the intellectual, moral, and religious character of the peo- 
ple of this parish, in common with that of the whole country, has 
long been progressively and steadily improving, it is pleasing to con-

template ; and nothing but the darkest prejudice could lead any one 
to controvert or deny it. That " security," which the inhabitants 
here were supposed formerly to possess, from their sequestered si- 
tuation, against " the encroaching influences of that corruption 
which other places of more business and resort" were exposed to, 
was at best but a very equivocal sort of advantage. The union 
of the two kingdoms found Scotland with the most inadequate 
means of employment for her population, miserably scanty as it 
was ; and previous ages of feudal barbarity had sunk the condition 
of the people to the lowest point of indigence, ignorance, and im- 
morality. Nor did the union, so indispensable to her improve- 
ment, at first lead to those ameliorations which have ultimately so 
copiously flowed from it. On the contrary, its first fruits were only 
to allure the inhabitants of Scotland, altogether ignorant of trade 
and commerce, and, with no systematic knowledge of agriculture, 
almost universally to plunge into the demorahzing vortex of smug- 
gling, which, from the new excise imposts then laid on, seemed to 
offer so great a temptation. So generally were all classes, high 
and low, connected with this outrageous practice, that, for a long 
time, the recent and ill-consolidated government of the Revolution 
was utterly unable eff"ectually to repress such disgraceful violations 
of its authority. For greatly more than half a century subsequent 
to the union, such was the inauspicious condition of this country ; 
and there can be no doubt if it did not rather retrograde, it was 
impossible any material advancement could be made. 

During the last three years there have been 6 illegitimate births 
in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — The extent of land of all qualities occasionally 
in or fit for cultivation is about 6000 acres ; of waste fit only for 
pasture, 2650, exclusive of Little Cumbray, and from which 
neither its situation nor nature admit that the arable may ever be 
profitably augmented from it, — attempts of this kind having al- 
ready been pushed to their utmost limits, if not a step beyond 
them. There is now here no undivided common. The extent 
of growing wood has before been alluded to. The management 
of trees is perhaps the worst understood, and least attended to 
species of culture in this part of the country, and assuredly the 
parish of Kilbride forms no exception to the general depravity. 

Rent of Land. — Small patches of land near the village fetch as 

high as from L. 3 to lu 5 an acre, but the medium rental of the 

1 



WEST KILBRIDE. 



261 



whole of the arable parts does not probably exceed L. 1, 10s. — 
the moorish wastes, perhaps, not 5s. which would make the gross 
annual rent of land about L. 9662. The value of produce and 
cost of labour is much the same all over the district of Cuning- 
ham ; and, as particulars of these must be communicated from 
many parishes of greater importance, it seems unnecessary they 
should be repeated here. The arable pastures are chiefly occu- 
pied with dairy cows, the produce being almost exclusively cheese 
of the quality known by the name of Dunlop-cheese. The moors 
are principally stocked with sheep of the native or black-faced race. 

The different species of live-stock in 1819 were as follows : horses 
of all kinds, 162 ; dairy cows, 600 ; rearing and other varieties of 
cattle, 790; sheep, 2373; swine, 218 ;i- and there is no reason 
to think that great alteration has taken place since that period. 

The natural adaptation of this parish, whether with respect to 
climate, soil, or situation in the great manufacturing district in 
which it lies, is obviously as to the dairy ; and the practice ac- 
cordingly becomes more and more accommodated to that species 
of farming. The soil is far too deficient in calcareous and adhe- 
sive components to fit it in any degree for continued aration ; and 
cannot advantageously be subjected to the plough but after a con- 
siderable period of rest. Neither are many of the pastures rich 
enough for the purpose of feeding stock ; hence the alternative of 
the dairy, perhaps the most suitable to which it ever can be ap- 
plied, has wisely been universally adopted. The whole is now 
pretty completely enclosed and subdivided, the fences being ge- 
nerally hedge and ditch, but in high and arid situations stone dikes 
have usually been adopted ; and for about fifty years past all the 
ordinary means of improving the soil have pretty successfully 
been in practice. Here, as perhaps everywhere else, road-making 
was the last improvement to make its appearance in the manage- 
ment of farms, though theoretically it ought to have preceded all 
others, as, without facility of access, every operation must be done, 
at a great disadvantage. Consequently much this way remains to 
be done ; there being scarcely a farm yet sufficiently provided with 

 The number of arable farms may be about fifty, which makes the medium size 
about 120 acres, the largest about 300, the smallest HO. For some time back, an in- 
clination to reduce the size of farms has prevailed, some of the largest having latterly 
been divided into two, others into three separate possessions ; and, but for the expense 
of additional buildings, it is probable this practice would soon become more general. 
The moors are chiefly divided into two sheep-walks, that of Crosby and Southanan.'

the means of internal communication. Lime is very generally now 
applied to the soil, and in considerable quantities ; but the distance, 
from four to eight miles and in some cases the badness of the 
roads, render it a very costly application. Sea-weed is pretty 
abundant, but the right to it belongs exclusively to lands adjoining 
to the sea shore, each property, too, being confined to its own 
boundary. The quickness with which this substance dissolves, re- 
quires its instant application to the soil or admixture into compost 
on its being cast ashore ; but from the former wretchedness of the 
roads, and it may be indolence of the elder husbandmen, the prac- 
tice has generally been to deposit it near the beach until it was 
greatly reduced, often to not a third of its original quantum, that 
the labour of carting it might be abridged  More correct ideas of 
tliis, however, begin to prevail, and a better course to be followed, 
all being now satisfied of the great loss sustained by such neglect. 
The grain crops raised here are, — wheat, oats, barley, and a little 
rye along the sea-shore, of pulse, beans, pease, and, to a limited 
extent, tares. The green crops are, potatoes, turnips, and carrots. 
Though of late years the cultivation of wheat has Ijeen carried to 
an imprudent extent, the quantity sown still bears but a small pro- 
portion to that of oats, perhaps not more than as one to four. 
Wheat is very liable to disease and injury here. The climate is 
too humid, and consequently cold, as the soil is perhaps of too 
feeble a stamina to admit of this fine grain ever being extensively 
or profitably cultivated in this neighbourhood. Oats, on the con- 
trary, thrive exceedingly well, and their straw is superior to all 
others as fodder for the dairy cows ; yet it is remarked, that an 
equal luxuriance in the growth of the crop here does not realize 
an equal return of grain with soils of a more clayish nature, and 
the seed requires more frequently to be renewed. The barley 
tribes are likewise pretty congenial to this locality, though for a 
good while past their cultivation has been very limited. But they 
will probably soon be more appreciated and attended to, barley 
being a much easier crop, and more suitable than any other grain 
for sowing down for pasture. Beans, especially in the drill mode, 
succeed extremely well on even very light land, and are cultivated 
to a considerable extent ; but peas are of difficult management, 
albeit for poor dry soils they seem not ill suited, and often produce 
good returns ; the quantity sown is but trifling. Potatoes are not 
nearly so well adapted to feeble spongy soils as turnips, — a circum- 
stance which is every year being made more apparent in the cul-

tivation of these crops in this place, Hitlierto potatoes have been 
far more extensively cultivated than turnips, which are of recent 
introduction ; but this is fast changing in favour of the latter. The 
Swedish turnip is greatly pi'eferred to all others, and it thrives un- 
commonly well on almost all kinds of soil and situations. Carrots 
have been still more recently introduced ; and, though occasional- 
ly yielding singularly profitable crops, are not yet sown to any con- 
siderable breadth. They are of nice and troublesome cultivation 
and withal subject in an uncommon degree to be destroyed by 
maggots, and otherwise. Mangel-wurzel has but just made its ap- 
pearance, and it is not likely successfully to compete with Swe- 
dish turnip ; nevertheless it deserves further trial, as the plant seems 
to thrive very well on good deep land. Ryegrass is extensively 
raised here ; and it is nearly all ripened for seed which sells for 
from 2s. to 3s. a busheL But this is a practice by no means con- 
sistent with good farming, the succeeding pastures being greatly 
deteriorated by its scourging effects, so that nothing but the pres- 
sing necessities of the cultivator can excuse such a course. Flax 
may be said to have wholly disappeared, scarcely a patch being 
now to be seen. 

Leases. — The usual duration of leases has long been for nine- 
teen years ; but latterly, there seems an inclination on the part of 
landlords to shorten them, which is certainly a very mistaken view, 
whether as regards the one party or the other ; the independence 
and prosperity of the tenant alone can redound to the interest and 
advantaofe of the owner of the soil. 

Farm- Buildings. — As to farm-buildings, a great many steadings 
have latterly been reconstructed, and such, for the most part, have 
been substantially and commodiously built. Others are still very 
. comfortless and unsuitable to the purposes required. The imple- 
ments of husbandry here are all of the most approved order, the 
iron plough being general, but single horse carts alone are used. 
Thrashing-milb have become general, few farms of any size being 
without one. 

Manufactures. — Besides a tan-work, which employs eight or ten 
hands, the only branch of manufacture here is that of weaving and

•the sessional records here : — " Sabbath, October 24, 1725 : This day compeared Ro-

sewing muslin for the manufacturers of Glasgow and Paisley. 
There are about 100 hand-looms employed, and perhaps an equal 
number of females engaged in sewing. The painfully distressed 
condition of this important class of mechanics has been too long 
and too widely felt to require any illustration in the statistics of 
the obscure' parish under consideration. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The entire disposable produce of this parish, as well as that of 
all the country round about, is absorbed in the great trading com- 
munities of Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock, with perhaps the 
single exception of rye-grass seed, a considerable quantity of which 
is annually sent up to England. But of the different species and 
quantities of such, it is impossible to give details that could at all 
be depended upon, scarcely any individual making memoranda of 
such matters, — a circumstance much to be regretted, as an exact 
knowledge of this sort would be of essential advantage to farmers 
of every degree. The only village here is the parochial one of 
Kilbride. It is situated about a mile off the shore, in a finely shel- 
tered depression, through which flows a convenient stream of pure 
water, which is employed in driving no fewer than five different 
mills, two for grinding oats, one for dressing flax now but little 
used, one for grinding bark for the tannery, and another for re- 
ducing charcoal to a fine powder for the use of founderies. Here 
is a well ordered post-office, which has been established for about 
twenty years, with much advantage to the commnuity. The turn- 
pike roads are the Greenock and Portpatrick line, which runs along 
the coast the whole length of the parish, and a line from the vil- 
lage inland communicates with the Glasgow road at the village of 
Dairy, in all about nine miles. The parish roads extend to thir- 
teen miles, being all kept in tolerable repair, and furnished with 
bridges nearly in all cases where required. At Portincross there 
is a small quay, constructed about thirty-five years ago, chiefly at 
the expense of the proprietor of the estate. It is capable of ad- 
mitting vessels of forty or fifty tons burden at high-water, and is 
chiefly used in the shipment. of produce for the Clyde. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church with its surrounding 
burying-ground, encircled by spreading ash and plane trees, stands 
near the centre of the village on a gentle rise a situation exceed- 
ingly well chosen for the convenience of the population generally. 
It was chiefly rebuilt and somewhat enlarged in the year 1732, 
and has received some subsequent improvements. But it is still, in 



WEST KILBRIDE. Oa 

all respects, a most unsuitable and uncomfortable place of public 
worship ; and cannot be more justly described than m the former 
Account, as « a long, narrow, mean-looking edifice ; low m the 
walls, and deep-roofed." In length, it is upwards of 70 feet, the 
width scarcely 18; and from the lowness of the walls, hardly 10 
feet in height, and from there being a gallery in each end, light 
and ventilation are almost wholly destroyed. Under these circum- 
stances, the necessity of a new church has long been seriously 
felt ; but as it was supposed that the present building could not 
be condemned as altogether insufficient in itself, the heritors have 
all along resisted being at the expense. Last year, the congrega- 
tion, despairing of any thing being done, obtained permission to 
erect an aisle for their own further accommodation, and which has 
now been completed, solely by voluntary contribution. Altogether, 
there is now accommodation in the church for 800 sitters, which 
as to mere extent is perhaps nearly sufficient for the wants of the 
parish. No benefactions have ever been made to the parish, ex- 
cept occasional small sums to the poor ; nor are there any free sit- 
tings within the church. The manse is delightfully situated on the 
glebe land, close by the church. It is sufficiently commodious and 
substantial, having been built only about thirty years ago. The 
glebe lies conveniently around the manse, and consists of very fine 
land, but is only of the statutory extent of 4 acres, which lets at 
L. 4 per acre. Since 1790, three several augmentations have been 
obtained to the stipend, and the whole now consist of 16 chalders 
of victual, with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. 

About 250 families attend the Established Church, and the 
number of communicants is 5 1 5. The Earl of Eglinton is patron ; 
but the heritors have all acquired right to their respective teinds, 
a considerable portion of which is still unexhausted. There are 
here no chapels of ease ; but there is a very neat and commodious 
place of worship belonging to the United Associated Synod, built 
about fifteen years ago ; and having accommodation for 434 sitters, 
though the usual attendance does not probably exceed 150. They 
are at present without an ordained minister, their late pastor, the 
Rev. Peter Mather, who was appointed to officiate permanent- 
ly amongst them, having left them, and joined himself to those de- 
nominated Independents. 

Education. — There are in all three schools in this parish ; all 
situated in the village, but the parochial one alone enjoys any en- 
dowment. The average number of scholars attending all three

AYRSHIRE. 



for the last- five years has been 211; in the parish school, day 
classes 96, night classes 39 ; the other schools have, one 40 the 
other 36. In the parish school are taught English reading and 
grammar, writuig, arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, and na- 
vigation, also the rudiments of Latin, Greek, and French The 
other two are confined to English, writing, and arithmetic. The 
school salary is L. 27, 17s. 8d., exclusive of the emoluments 
ot session-clerk, which office has always been enjoyed by the 
parochial teacher. The average fees of teaching are, at the 
parish school, 3s. per quarter; at one of the private schools, 
3s., at the other only Is. 6d. The age at which children enter 
school IS usually from five to six years. Scarcely any individual 
brought up here has not been taught to read and vvrite, and the far 
greater number, in addition, the first rules of arithmetic. The pa- 
rish school-room, like the church, is quite unsuitable to the pur- 
pose for which it is required. It is contained in the ground-floor 
of an old house formerly the manse, and, what from the nature of 
the situation, extreme lowness of the ceiling, and rude inhospitable 
interior, its ventilation is inconceivably bad, and cannot be but 
most pernicious to the health and constitutions of its young and ten- 
der inmates, as well as most uncomfortable to the teachers. 

The people, it cannot be doubted, are every way sensible of the 
inestimable blessings of education ; but, for a good many years past, 
it is to be feared, many of them have been but little able to aff'ord 
the necessary expense of obtaining it to their luckless offspring. 
At the age they should enter school, great numbers of children 
here, as elsewhere, especially in the manufacturing districts, are put 
to labour in a variety of ways, that they may contribute to their 
own physical support ; and thus, but for the means of Sunday 
schools, and other expedients, would inevitably be left to grow 
up without any knowledge of letters whatever  This parish, 
however, is exceedingly well provided with teachers, and the abili- 
ties, diligence, and assiduity of Mr Smith of the parochial school, 
are above all praise. Nor are the conduct and efficiency of the pri- 
vate teachers in their sphere at all less deserving of commendation. 

A parochial subscription library has been established in Kilbride 
for about seven years, and now consists of upwards of 400 volumes 
of pretty judiciously selected works in general literature. By this 
means, a taste for reading is being diffused among the young, which 
cannot fail of being productive of the most beneficial effects. 
Friendly Societies. — There are three diff'erent friendly societies

established here, one of which was instituted so early as 1796. 
They are all supported by small entry monies and annual contri- 
butions. The oldest affords aid to decayed and necessitous mem- 
bers only ; the other two give support, during inability to labour, 
without reference to circumstances. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— T\\q average number of regular 
pensioners on the poor's fund for the last six years has been 14. 
Average weekly allowance to each Is. 7d.

Average incidental expenses in like manner, • ' 

L.70 13 6 

Contra average income from the usual sources for same period, 50 1 3 4 

L.20 2 2 

This deficit of L. 20, 2s. 2d. for the current and preceding 
year has been made up by assessment,— a mode to which heritors 
every where show the greatest reluctance, whatever be the feelings 
of the poor on the subject; and nothing but the utmost necessity 
assuredly will ever force them to the adoption of such an alterna- 
tive. Nevertheless, it must be remarked, assessment is the only 
fair and equitable manner of proceeding in such a matter. As to 
any argument about the feeHngs of people reduced to the neces- 
sity of receiving charity, whether it shall thus be justly apportion- 
ed or fall exclusively, on the benevolent, such can only be viewed 
as ingenious sophistry, altogether to evade the unwelcome burden. 
The scources from which the ordinary funds arise here, are : col- 
lections at church door; fees for proclamations of marriage and 
use of mortcloths; rent of a house, and rent of some pews in the 
church. 

/„„5._0f inns or houses for the sale of spirits, &amp;c. there are 
ten licensed within the parish, seemingly all conducted with order 
and propriety ; most of them, however, are but on a small scale, and 
certainly but little necessary to any beneficial purpose. 

2ueZ. — The ordinary fuel used here is coal, chiefly from Ste- 
venston, distant about six miles, and a little from Dairy, still far- 
ther off. Peats are used in the hilly parts. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

As regards agriculture, the system at present in use here seems 
in most respects to be exceedingly well suited to the nature of 
the locality ; but that it is still susceptible of great improvement 
admits not of a doubt. Draining requires to be carried incalcula- 
bly farther ; and, as before noticed, vast improvement might be ef-

fected by the construction of roads for internal access in almost 
every farm. The only portion of the parish which seems to re- 
quire a common drain of any considerable size to be yet made is 
the fine plain running along from Hunterston to Ardneill • 'by 
which means, a considerable portion of very manageable land m'iffht 
still be greatly improved. But as this would affect different pro- 
perties, difficulties must attend any arrangements thereto Great- 
er facility might yet certainly be obtained in the procuring of 
lime, by the further improvement of roads, and perhaps by some 
arrangement for its importation by sea. It need hardly be ob- 
served, nothing could more immediately tend to encourage im- 
provement, than a reduction of the cost of an article so essential 
to the proper management of land. 

In reflecting on the improvements which have been effected 
since the era of the first Account, there is no change more pleas- 
ing to contemplate, than that which has taken place in the man- 
ners and habits of the people themselves. This is especially ob- 
servable of the rural portion of the community, though certainly 
great progress has been made in the domestic and personal con- 
dition of all. At the former period, farm-houses, almost without 
exception, presented no indications of superior comfort or refine- 
ment to the ordinary habitations of labourers, differing, indeed, in 
nothing from such, but in their more ample stores ''and greater 
means of rude hospitality. As a criterion, there was not probably 
at that period a carpeted parlour to be met with in a ftirm-house 
within the parish. Now matters are reversed, very few being with- 
out that mark of decent comfort ; whilst the general economy of 
most in every way corresponds with this indication of refinement. 

But the chief advantage of which this parish probably is sus- 
ceptible, is as a sea-bathing station and coast residence, though 
hitherto very little has been attempted towards such an object. 
The sea-shore all the way from the fine harbour of Ardrossan to 
Portincross northward, a reach of above five miles, is in all re- 
spects peculiarly suitable for such a purpose. Bordering on the 

_  Our existing road laws seem much to require alteration and amendment. What 
IS called Statute labour money, is levied most unjustly as regards all town commu- 
nities, they having no control in its exienditure, which is at the sole disposal of a 
certain class of proprietors of land, and who of course naturally enough direct its ap- 
plication in a great measure to their own farm-roads. All roads of any considerable 
thoroughfare should probably be constituted turnpike, whilst a general act might be 
iramed, empowering all towns and villages who chose to avail themselves of the pri- 
vilege, to assess themselves for the maintenance and improvement of their streets. 
1 urely agricultural lines should be wholly made and maintained by the owners of 
the lands they affect. , ' .

wide and open channel, with a southern aspect, the beach is finely 
shelving and accessible ; whilst all along, steep and picturesque 
banks give complete protection from the north and east. Facility 
of conveyance alone seems awanting to give to this locality every 
possible superiority over all places lying higher up in the narrow 
portions of the Frith, where of course it is impossible but that the 
marine influence must be greatly less efficacious. This disadvan- 
tage of intercourse will probably soon be obviated. By the com- 
pletion of the Ardrossan and Glasgow railway, already in part exe- 
cuted, the most ample means of access will be obtained. The 
distance in all is little more than thirty miles, and by adopting the 
locomotive engine, may, with the greatest safety, be accomplished 
in about an hour and a half, and at a very small expense. The 
benefit of such an improvement would not be confined to this 
neighbourhood ; but would in an almost equal degree extend to 
the opposite coast of Arran, the romantic shores of which, by 
means of steam-boats from Ardrossan, might then be reached from 
the city of Glasgow in perhaps less than three hours and a half 
Such are the capabilities of improvement which this country every- 
where presen'ts, tending to the further comfort and convenience 
of its great population; and it is impossible to set hmits to what 
may yet be effected under circumstances favourable to the de- 
velopement of its boundless and varied resources. 

Island of Little Cumbray. 
The Island of Little or Lesser Cumbray lies about midway be- 
twixt the southern part of the island of Bute and the promontory of 
Portincross, in this parish, distant from either about two and a half 
miles. It is, however, attached to the parish of Kilbride only quoad 
sacra ; civilly and politically, it forms part of the shire of Bute, the 
juridical seat of which is the burgh of Rothesay. It lies in length 
nearly north and south, and, according to a parish atlas of Cun- 
inghame, published at Beith in 1829, contains \\ square mile in 
superficial extent, equal to nearly 700 acres ; where highest, it may 
be from 500 to 600 feet above the level of the sea. It is the 
ptoperty of the Earl of Eglinton, whose family has long posses- 
sed it. 

This island is composed entirely of secondary trap, but which 
appears to rest on the brown sandstone of the opposite coast, 
which comes into view along the water's edge at the landing 
place on the east side, and very probably is continued throughout. 



270 



AYIISHIRE. 



The trap is formed into thick strata, very distinctly marked, rising 
like steps of a stair upwards, declining, however, at a considerable 
angle from the north. On its summit, near the centre of the is- 
land, is seated a circular tower of about 30 feet in height, the re- 
mains of a former lighthouse — a very conspicuous land-mark from 
all points in the channel. The present lighthouse, referred to as 
building in the former Account, stands on the edge of a precipice, 
overhanging the sea, on the west side of the island, opposite Bute, 
and presents, with the keeper's residence and garden on the little 
plain adjoining, an interesting and beautiful object, in contrast with 
the wild crags amidst which it is placed. The caves formerly al- 
luded to are mere fissures in the rocks. They all occur'low down, 
and near the south end of the island, where the stratification is more 
distinct and columnar. The largest of them, which is on the east 
side, is dignified with the name of King's Cave; and, in the tales 
of the place, is said to communicate, by a submarine passage, with 
the opposite island of Bute — such have ever been the speculations 
of credulity and ungaided fancy. 

For a long time past, this rocky islet has been principally occu- 
pied as a rabbit-warren, — about 450 dozen being taken annually ; 
but there are besides a few sheep and some young cattle grazed 
on it. Cultivation is wholly confined to a few potatoe gardens. 
The number of families resident on it is four, including the tacks- 
man's, who rents the whole, and the lighthouse keeper's. In for- 
mer times, no fewer than eight or ten families are said to have been 
located here, who all shared in the occupancy of its surface ; but 
it is evident they must mainly have subsisted by fishing ; yet many 
traces of cultivation are to be discerned on the scanty soil of the steps 
of the rocks, where alone any thing could ever have been forced 
off it. Except a few ash trees near its north east corner, and pret- 
ty large patches of elder bushes on the opposite shore, the island 
is wholly destitute of wood. 

Both of the Cumbrays were undoubtedly included in the do- 
mains of the Stewart family, ancestors of the Kings of Scotland. 
On the erection of the principality of Scotland by Robert III., in 
favour of his eldest son, in 1404, the smaller Cumbray was includ- 
ed in it ; and a century afterwards, it appears to have been kept as a 
royal preserve of some kind. In the registry of the privy-seal, the 
following entry occurs : — 

October 28, 1515.— Lettre to Hew Erie of Eglintoune, mak- 
and him and his assignais, keeparis, oversearis, correkaris, and sup-

caus Robert Huntare of Huntarestoune, forrestar of heritage of 
the said isle, is nocht of power to resist the personis that waistis 
the samyn, without suplie and help, &amp;c." 

And Mr Donald Monro, in his Description of the Western Isles, 
1594, observes, " Besides this the Greater Cumbray, lyes ane 
iyle callit Cumbray of the Dais, because there is many Dayis in- 
till it." Not a vestige of the deer here alluded to has survived 
within the memory of the present time, nor does any remembrance 
of them appear to have been handed down by local tradition. 

On an islet rock on its east side, near the middle of the island, 
stands an ancient square tower, the walls of which are still nearly 
entire. It is about 35 feet in height, embattled. The area in- 
side is 28 feet by 15, the walls being 6 in thickness; and as usual 
the first story is vaulted over with stone arches. During Crom- 
well's visit to Scotland, Principal Baillie alludes to his having re- 
tired to this fortlet for some time, to which the family of Eglinton, 
his great patrons, appear at that conjuncture to have withdrawn. 

«    Cromwell, with the whole body of his army and can- 
non, comes peaceably by the way of Kilsyth to Glasgow. The 
magistrates and ministers fled all away. I got to the Isle of Cum- 
ray, with my Lady Montgomery, but left all my family and goods 
to Cromwell's courtesy, which indeed was great ; for he took such 
a course with his soldiers, that they did less displeasure at Glas- 
gow than if they had been in London, though Mr Zachary Boyd 
railed on them all to their face in the High Church."— ieWers, Sfc. 
ii. 395. 

In the former Account it is stated, that this castle " was sur- 
prised and burned by Cromwell's soldiers," which is by no means 
improbable, though, perhaps resting only on the authority of oral 
tradition. Lord Eglinton appears all through to have been highly ini- 
mical to the Protector. Monk, for some short time, placed a small 
garrison in the house of Eglinton itself ; and it is stated, that the 
Castle of Ardrossan, a place of considerable strength, was then 
thrown down by the same authority. In the burgh records of 
Glasgow, is registered a curious contract, dated in 1568, in which 
the following particulars relative to the castle of Cumbray and

others appear : — " Hew Erie of Eglintoun" contracted with 
" George Elphinstoun glssinwricht, burges of Glasgow, that the

The ruins of the chapel and tomb of St Vey, alluded to in the 
former Account, still remain. They are situated near the top of 
the hill, a little northward of the castle. The chapel is 33 feet 
by 15 inside ; the walls, very little of which are now standing, are 
about three feet in thickness, but the mortar with which tbey have 
been built seems to have been bad, and very sparingly used. In 
the tomb, which is at a little distance north of the chapel, are two 
flat stones, on one of which, now broken in two, are sculptured 
some ornamental tracery, such as is usually to be seen on those 
ancient monuments called Danish stones, but no vestige of any 
inscription is to be observed on any of them. This inclosure, 
which is of a square form, and of very hmited dimensions, was 
originally surrounded by a stone wall, but of which only the 
foundation now exists. There is a tradition, that this chapel, ano- 
ther at Ardrossan, and a third on the Garrock-head, in Bute, were 
all served by one and the same priest, who of course, journeyed 
per vices among them. 

About twenty years ago, the late Earl of Eglinton caused to be 
opened some tumuli on the north extremity of this island, called 
Shanniwilly point ; and in which were found sepulchral urns, and 
fragments of military weapons, which were all carried off to Eglin- 
ton Castle. -IP 

A son and successor of the historian Wodrow, m the parish ot 
Eastwood, spent his latter days in this sequestered island, where 
he died, and was interred in a tomb, which had some time before 
been constructed for the sepulture of one of his daughters, who 
had died here in early life of consumption. This romantic burial-

I'RESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ROBERT WALLACE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — In charters of the fourteenth century, the name of 
this parish was written Dalrimpill, which is evidently an abbre- 
viation of the Celtic, Dail-a'-chruimpuill, Anglice, Dale of the 
crooked pool. This etymology literally applies to the situation of 
the village, where the church of Dalrymple stands, at a bend or 
turn of the river Doon ; and " this says an eminent Gaelic scho- 
lar, who visited this place in 1832, is exactly what a Highlander, 
who knew no English, would denominate the valley of Dalrymple." 

Extent and Boundaries. — The extent of this parish, from west 
to east, is 7 miles ; its greatest breadth is 3 miles ; and it contains 
a surface of about 12 square miles. It is bounded on the north 
and east, by the parishes of Ayr, Coylton, and Dalmellington ; 
and on the south and west, by the river Doon, which separates it 
from the parishes of Straiton, Kirkmichael, and Maybole. 

Topographical Appearances. — With the exception of the valley, 
where the village and church are situated, none of the rest of the 
parish can be termed level, for the surface abounds with numerous 
rising grounds, or little round hills, from most of which are seen 
the Islands of Bute and Arran, the peninsula of Cantyre, Ailsa- 
Craig, and the " lofty Benlomond," which is 44' north from, and 
on the same meridian line with the British fortlet on Woodland, 
the most southern eminence of this parish. From Kirkmien, the 
highest part of the parish, the north of Ireland is distinctly seen 
in clear weather. 

Climate and Diseases. — The climate of the parish-, and especi-

ally in the valley, is mild, and consWered healthy. In the course 
of the last eight years, out of a population of 9G0 and upwards, 
only 114 died. Of these, there were under twenty, 48; between 
twenty and forty, 23; forty and sixty, 16; sixty and seventy, 10; 
seventy and eighty, 8 ; eighty and ninety, 6 ; upwards of ninety, 3. 
The diseases of which they died are the following : viz. decay of 
nature, 24 ; consumption, 20 ; inflammation, 7 ; fever, 9 ; water 
in the head, 7 ; water in the chest, 4; hooping-cough, 5 ; measles, 
1; croup, 5; dysentery, 3; dropsy, 2; apoplexy, 2; cancer, 4; 
small-pox, 1 ; scrofula, 1 ; influenza, 1 ; ulceration of the tongue, 
1 ; liver complaint, 2 ; killed, 1 ; unknown, 14. 

Hydrography, Springs. — There are several mineral springs; but, 
with the exception of one on the estate of Barbieston, they are 
seldom or ever thought of. With regard to this one, the late Mr 
Fullarton of Skeldon, formerly one of the heritors of this parish, 
sent the writer of this Account, the following communication : " I 
was at first led to notice the mineral spring near Skeldon, in 1798, 
when I heard that the late Captain Campbell of Barbieston used 
it himself, and frequently made his servants drink of it. It is a 
chalybeate, but not strong; also, I believe, a gentle cathartic. For 
some years it ran copiously, but the working of marl in the bank 
above brought down the brae face, and nearly choked the spring, 
though it has been constantly but gently discharging in that place 
ever since. I never knew it freeze during the severest frosts I have 
ever seen, having had frequent opportunities during winter, when 
shooting through these ' banks and braes.' I have not analysed 
it, but I have no doubt, if properly opened and secured which I 
once intended to do, it might prove both useful and medicinally 
beneficial." 

Lochs. — There are four lochs in the parish, Martinham, Snipe, 
Kerse, and Lindston. Martinham is the -largest, being about a 
mile and a-half in length, by a furlong, at an average, in breadth, 
and it stretches a considerable way into the parish of Coylton. Its 
greatest depth is 26 feet. There is a small islet in this loch, and 
on it, the ruins of a building probably in former times the man- 
sion-house of the proprietor of Martinham, 100 feet in length, 
by 30 in breadth. The islet is almost entirely covered with wood, 
and both the wood and the ruins are completely cased in ivy. The 
scenery around Martinham is exceedingly picturesque. 

There are in all the lochs abundance of pike, perch, and eel ; 
they are frequented too by wild geese and ducks,,teal, widgeon, &amp;c. 



DALRYMPLE.

A pike was lately caught in Martinham locli, which weighed 29 
imperial pounds. An ordinary sized pike had first seized the bait 
and hook, and the large one was taken, by swallowing all three to- 
gether. The outlet from Martinham Loch is a small burn which 
flows into the river Doon. 

River. — The only river in theparish is the Doon, which runs along 
its south and west sides, and forms the boundary betweenthe districts 
of Kyle and Carrick. This river flows from Loch Doon, and, after 
a course of thirty miles, or thereabouts, of various windings, and 
passing nine gentlemen's seats, viz. Berbeth, Hollybush, Skeldon, 
Cassillis, Monkwood, Auchendrane, Doonholm, Doonside, Mount 
-Charles ; and three kirks, Dalmellington, Dalrymple, and Alloway, 
also the monument erected in 1822, to the memory of Burns, the 
cottage where he was born, &amp;c., it falls into the Frith of Clydej 
near Ayr. Like other rivers issuing from lochs, the Doon is more 
steady in its course, and does not rise so high, or fall so much 
away, as the genei'ality of them. It is, however, occasionally sub- 
ject to floods. About fifty years ago, one of these occurred, which 
did considerable damage ; and in January 1814, the melting of the 
snow on the adjacent hills swelled the river to such an extent, that 
it burst up immense fragments of ice, and forced them forward 
with irresistible impetuosity, in consequence of which the trees 
on the banks were bent like willows, — Skeldon wooden bridge was 
carried away, — the village gardens were under ice and water, and the 
village houses were inundated from three to four feet above the floors. 

The banks of the Doon are in general bold, and well-wooded, 
and there are many fine haughs on its sides. 

Fishing. — The stake-nets at the mouth of the river have injured 
the fishing above very considerably ; but notwithstanding these, 
salmon contrive to get up, and many are taken every year, from 
ten to twenty pounds in weight. Besides salmon, there are also 
in the river sea and yellow trout, par, eel, and pike. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological structure of this pa- 
rish is very distinctly exhibited along the banks of the river Doon, 
which, as has been already mentioned, bounds it on the south and 
west. The banks are, in several places, of considerable height, 
and, by the influence of the weather, the strata, especially at Bore- 

 A very interesting account of this was communicated to the editor of the Ayr 
Advertiser, and published at the time, by Mr Campbell of Cumnock, who was then 
parochial schoolmaster of Dalrymple. Mr Campbell was an eye-witness of the scene, 
and kindly received the villagers, who were driven from their houses, into his school, 
and supplied them with every comfort.

land, have been exposed ; and in jutting out among the trees and 
copse-wood, by which they are generally covered, present striking 
and picturesque appearances. Here are observed beds of limestone, 
old red sandstone, and conglomerate, which dip at an inclination of 
between twenty and thirty degrees towards the north-east, under the 
coal fields of Coylton and Patna ; and these are obviously to be 
classed under the same series of rocks, which in the neighbour- 
ing parishes of Maybole and Kirkmichael are surmounted by the 
coal measures. The limestone is generally found in masses, with 
clayey matter intervening, and is seldom more than a foot in thick- 
ness. It is extremely hard, and presents only occasionally the traces 
of small shells. It has in several places been dug out, and found, 
after burning, to yield a good lime for agricultural purposes. Trap 
penetrating the strata, and presenting the usual appearances, is 
also found in several districts; and boulders, both of trap and 
granite, are scattered over the fields. 

Soils. — The soil is of various kinds. The greatest part, how- 
ever, is the clay ; the rest consists of gravel, sand, and loam. In 
some places, the clay soil is very poor and barren, scarcely repay- 
ing the expense of cultivation ; in others, when properly managed, 
and sheltered from the wintry winds, by plantations or the adja- 
cent elevated grounds, it produces excellent crops. The clay soil 
is in some places red, in others blue, and a blujsh-white. The 
gravelly and the sandy soils yield the best pasture, and are best 
adapted for potatoes and turnips. The loam is mostly on the 
banks of the river, lochs, and rivulets, to which it has evidently 
been carried down from the higher grounds by the floods in winter. 
There is very little moss land in the parish. 

Botany. — The following list of plants of the rarer kind found in 
this parish, was furnished by Mr Smith of Monkwood Grove, an 
enthusiastic botanist. The writer has here arranged Mr Smith's 
list according to the Linnaean system, and accompanied it with an 
English translation :

Plantations. — The plantations consist of oak, elm, ash, alder, 
birch, plane, lime, larch, — silver, spruce, and Scotch fir. 

There are six beautiful oaks in the old garden at Skeldon, sup- 
posed to be upwards of 300 years old. A native of this parish, 
who died here about five and twenty years ago, on the verge of a 
hundred, said, that he remembered no difference in them in the whole 
course of his life ; and that the aged people in his time spoke of 
them as being more than 200 years old. Of two which were mea- 
sured lately, one was 12 feet round, and contained within the 
branches a circumference of 220 feet; the other was 10 feet round, 
and 20 feet from the root to the branches. Near the oaks are se- 
veral larches, equal in height and beauty to the generality of those 
in the Duke of AthoU's plantations, at Dunkeld. Half-way beween 
the church and manse, and in the glebe, are two magnificent and 
beautiful trees, a sycamore and a horse-chestnut. 

II. — Civil History. 

The barony of Dalrymple was held in former times by a family, 



278 



AY US II IKE. 



who took from tlieir lands the surname of Dah-ymple. In the reign of 
David II. 1330-32, the barony was divided into two parts, and pos- 
sessed by two families of the name of Dalrymple, who were pro- 
bably derived from a common progenitor. In 1371, John Ken- 
nedy of Dunure obtained a charter from Robert II. of half the ba- 
rony of " Dalrimpill," in Ayrshire, upon the resignation of Mal- 
colfn, the son of Gilchrist, the son of Adam de " Dalrimpill ;" and 
in 1377, the same John Kennedy obtained another charter from 
Robert II. of the other half of the barony of " Dalrympill," upon 
the resignation of Hugh, the son of Roland de " Dalrympill," and 
the whole continued to belong to his descendants till the reign of 
Charles II. 1660-84. 

Land-owners. — The land-owners of the parish are the Marquis 
of Ailsa, who has in point of valuation more than the half ; R. A. 
Oswald of Auchencruive, Esq. who has nearly a fourth ; the Ho- 
nourable Mrs Leslie Gumming ; and Andrew Hunter of Bonnie- 
ton, Esq. Skeldon and Hollybush are the only gentlemen's seats 
in the parish. The former is the property of Mrs Leslie Cum- 
miing, and is occupied by Sir James Montgomery Cuninghame 
of Corsehill, Bart. ; the other is the property of Mr Hunter, and 
is occupied by Captain Brian Hodgson, R. N. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers of births and 
marriages, and the minutes of the kirk-session, commence in 1 699, 
immediately after the ordination of Mr Lawrie. The register of 
deaths commences in 1739, and ends at 1793. A new volume, 
however, was begun in 1816. Including an heritors' book, there 
are eight volumes altogether, and the whole have been kept pretty 
regularly. 

Antiquities — Roman Road. — The line of a Roman road, sup- 
posed to have formed a communication between the Friths of Sol- 
way and Clyde, passes through this parish. Entering it at the 
eastern extremity, it passes through the farms of Polnessan, Smith- 
ston, Newfield, Boreland, Hollybush-Mains, and Causeway, which 
is supposed to have taken its name from this road. From Cause- 
way it goes on to the farm of Perclewan, and passing through this 
and the farm of Lindston, it enters the parish of Ayr. Mr Chal- 
mers, in his Caledonia, mentions, that " some old people call this 
the Picts Road, and others, the Roman Way — " but the con- 
struction of the pavement in the Roman manner evinces clearly, 
he says, that it was a Roman Road."—" The Romans having 
puch a road, he continues, must necessarily have had encamp- 



DALK YMPLE. 



279 



ments through which it passed, yet no Roman camp has yet been 
discovered in Ayrshire. Their trinkets have been found in various 
parts of this extensive shire. They had erected their villas along 
the fine shore of the Clyde Frith, from Kellyburn to Irvine ; and 
on this coast the remains of their baths have been discovered." 

Roman Vessels. — A tripod of Roman bronze, and understood 
to be one of those used by the priest in pouring libations on the 
sacrifice, or otherwise about the altar, was found in a drained part 
of Lindston Loch, near the Roman road, about fifty years ago ; 
and a pitcher of earthen-ware, like that represented in prints, in 
the hand of the woman of Samaria, at the well at Sychar, was 
found at Perclewan, on the line of the same road in 1833,' Both 
have handles ; the tripod has also a spout, and the pitcher is glaz- 
ed, and of a greenish colour, and has the figure of a man's face 
and hands on the front, in relief. 

British Fortlets. — On a ridge of a rising ground, about three 
miles in length, forming the boundary between the valley of Dal- 
rymple and the low road from Ayr to Maybole, are the remains 
of three British fortlets. They are all circular, and surrounded 
by trenches, and contain each about fifty falls of ground. The 
trenches were filled with a rich black mould, resembling moss- 
earth ; and on its being removed some years ago for the purpose 
of manure, human skulls, bones, and deers' horns were found. 

Coins. — About ten years ago, some silver coins were found in a 
grave in the church-yard here. Two of them, which came into 
the writer's possession, are of the reign of James I. of Scotland, 
1424-36, and apparently half-groats. The one is of the Edin- 
burgh mint, and the other was struck at Stirling. They bear on 
the obverse, within a rose, the head of the sovereign, crowned, 
full-faced, with the sceptre on the right. Legend, jacobus . dei . 
GRATIA . REX . scoTORUM. On the reverse, a cross with three 
pellets, and a fleur-de-lis alternately in the quarters. Legend, 

DOMINUS . PROTECTOR . MBUS . ET . LIBERATOR . MEUS, and withiu 

a dotted circle, the first, villa . edinburgi, the other villa . 

STREVEVLI. 

There were also four silver pennies, of Edward I. and III. of 
England, found in a ploughed field, near the village in 1835. The 
largest has on one side, edw . r . angl . dns . hyb, and on the re- 
verse, civiTAS . LONDON. Two of them have on the reverse, ci- 
viTAS . CANTOR, and the fourth, civitas . dureme.

Stone Coffin-Sfc. — A stone coffin and bones were found in Bar- 
bieston holm, near the river Doon, and about a furlong to the east 
of Dalrymple village. In answer to inquiries on that subject, Mr 
Fullarton very kindly made the following coinmunication : " About 
] 804-5, 1 had bought the farm of Barbieston, and, wishing to make 
a new approach to my house at Skeldon, I set some men to work 
to form that road, in the course of which operation they had to 
cut though a small hillock of gravel. This proving of immediate 
use in making the road, was followed, and a considerable part re- 
moved, when suddenly the workers came on a stone coffin, in which 
was the skeleton of a large-sized person in a state of decay. On 
taking up the right thigh bone, I applied it to my own leg, as 
nearly as I possibly could to my hip-joint, and it went nearly to 
the middle of my shin, and I stand five feet eleven inches. From 
these circumstances, I was led to think that the bones must have 
belonged to some tall, powerful man, some chief or captain, par- 
ticularly as a battle is reported by Hollingshed, and also by Spot- 
tiswood, to have been fought at the ford of Barbieston."  

Cairns of Stones. — In Barbieston holm, and near the place where 
the stone coffin was found, there was a large cairn of stones ; and 
not far distant there were two others, one at St Valley, and an- 
other at Priest-hill. The whole, however, were removed in the 
course of the last thirty years, and among the stones were human 
and other bones, and some heads of pikes, spears, &amp;c.f 

Iiorn found in the trench of one of the fortlets, are all in the custody of the writer of 
this account at Dalrymple manse. 

• Extract from Hollingshed. He asserts that the region of the Silures, or of Si- 
lurie, contains Kyle, Carrick, and Cunningham. He thinks Coil " i.he same whom 
tlie Bryttans name Gutteline." — " Coil of Bryttaine assembling an armie, he entred 
into the Scottish borders, lying towards the Irish seas, wasting with fire and sword 
whatsoever he found in his ways, till he Cftme ' even to the river of Dune,' where he 
encamped on the banks thereof "—From Spottiswood. This historian relates, that, 
in the year 360. Maximus, a Roman prefect, excited the Picts to enter into an al- 
liance with liim against the Scots, and that the Romans and Picts encountered the 
Scots at the Water of Dun in Carrick. The Scots were routed, and their King, Eu- 
genius, with most of his nobihty, slain — From Boethius, Scotorum Historia. He 
relates that Coil was king of the Britons, Kenneth of the Scots. The latter, in con- 
junction with the Picts, attacked Coil, " ad Duna; amnis ripam." The Scots made 
the attack in front, while the Picts came upon him from behind by night. " Coilus

Castles— There were several old castles in the parish, Kerse, 
Skeldon, Barbieston, &amp;c. Some stones of the old vaults in Bar- 
bieston were found, bearing the dates of 1340 and 1345. This 
castle was modernized about fifty years ago, 'and is now a comfort- 
able dwelling-house. A part only of Skeldon Castle is in exist- 
ence, and like most ruined buildings, it has an echo. As to Kerse 
Castle, there is not one stone now left upon another, to point out 
where it was. The greatest part of it was used in the building of 
Skeldon House about sixty years ago, and the rest by the neigh- 
bouring farmers for various purposes. 

Mz7Zs.— Of mills, there are at Perclewan, a meal-mill; at Bar- 
bieston, a barley and flour-mill ; at Dalrymple village, a saw-mill ; 
and throughout the parish eighteen or twenty thrashing- mills, five 
or six of which are driven by water, and the rest by horses. At 
Nethermill, on the river Doon, there is a woollen manufactory, car- 
ried on by Mr William Templeton, a gentleman of great ingenu- 
ity and success, with respect to machinery. In the course of last 
year, Mr Templeton introduced gas light into his mill, which is of 
the greatest consequence and comfort to the workers.

 It may not be out of place to refer here to a poem composed by the late bir Alex- 
ander Boswell, from a traditional story communicated to him by George Rankine of 
Whitehill, Esq. to whom he dedicated it, and the date of the encounter he assigns to 
the fifteenth century. A few copies only were printed at the celebrated Auchin- 
leck press, and circulated among his most intimate friends. Mr Pitcairn of Edin- 
burgh, who published in 1830, the historical account of the Kennedys, already re- 
ferred to, reprinted this poem in the appendix of that book. He says that two differ- 
ent versions of the story are traditionally current among some very aged people in 
Carrick. One of these is that which has been adopted by Sir Alexander Boswell. 
The other relates, that three of the Crawfords of Lochnorris were present at the bat- 
tle, one of whom returned, heavily bemoaning the fall of his two brothers, when his 
widowed mother suddenly cut short his lamentation by exclaiming, " Is the sow flit- 
ted Aye is she, replied the youth, and five score of the Kennedies are drowned in 
the Doon." In that part of the Doon which bounds Boreland farm in this parish, 
there is a pool, called " Kennedie's Pool," to this day, from the circumstance of their 
having been drowned there.

III. — Population. 
From the returns made to Dr Webster in J755, it appears that 
the population of the parish at that time was 439 ; but when Mr 
Walker wrote his Statistical Account in 1791, the number of souls 
was only 380. Since that period, however, the population has 
greatly increased, partly from the erection of the village of Dal- 
rymple, and partly from the_subdivision of the lands of Martinham, 
so that the number amounted 



In 1801, to 514 

1811, 811 

1821, 933 

1831, 964

Charade', 8fc. — In a letter from Mr Campbell of Cumnock, who 
was upwards of twenty years schoolmaster of Dalrymple, he says, 
' you will not fail I am sure to give the peaceful inhabitants of 
Dalrymple, that character for decency, sobriety, and orderly con- 
duct, to which they are so justly entitled." The writer of this Ac- 
count, after an eight years residence among them as their minis- 
ter, has great pleasure in bearing his humble testimony to Mr 
Campbell's statement. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The number of acres standard imperial measure 
in the parish may be about 6700 ; of which 4200 are arable ; 1900 
consist of hill pasture and meadow ; 300 are under wood, and 100 
under water. The rent of land in the valley of Dalrymple is from 
L. 2 to L. 4, 10s. per acre ; and the average of arable land through- 
out the parish is L. 1, 3s. The principal crops raised are oats and 
wheat. The soils on which the wheat is generally sown, and where 
it grows to the greatest advantage, are the clean clay, properly fal- 
lowed J the deep dry holm land, and the light sandy and gravelly 
soils after potatoes or turnips. If the ground be sufficiently dry, 
it is generally sown as soon as they arc taken off the field ; il not, 
the sowing is deferred till the following spring. Wheat in most 



DALRYMPLE. 



283 



seasons grows best on ftillow land, and when sown about the mid- 
dle of autumn. The kinds mostly used are the white, red, creep- 
ing and spring wheat. Oats are sown on every kind of soil capable 
of cultivation ; they grow best, however, on the clay and loam. A 
great variety are sown, among which may be mentioned the com- 
mon, the potato, the red, the gray, and the early and late Angus- 
shire. Barley, bear, potatoes, turnips, beans, pease, carrots, beet, 
cabbages, flax, &amp;c. are grown mostly for family use. The following 
are the general rotations of crops : first year or lea crop, oats ; second 
year, green crop of potatoes, turnips, beans or pease ; third, wheat, 
oats, barley, or any white crop, and sow down with rye-grass, 
white, red, and yellow clover. Another system is, 1. oats ; 2. fal- 
low ; 3. wheat or any white crop, and sown down with rye-grass, &amp;c. 
Another, 1. oats; 2. fallow; 3. wheat or oats ; 4. beans or pease,, 
and sow down ; or 5. a white crop and sow down. Another, 1. oats, 
with manure on the surface, previous to ploughing ; 2. oats and sow 
down. Another, manure the surface ; take three white crops in 
succession, and sow down. 

The general method of fallowing land in this parish is to plough 
it as lightly as possible, early in winter ; to cross plough it with a 
deep furrow in May or June, and to give two ploughings more, in 
the course of the summer. These, with the necessary harrowing, 
draining, rolling, manuring, &amp;c. make it ready for the seed, which 
is usually sown in September or October. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants get from L. 10 to L. 16 per an- 
num, besides a free house and garden, two pecks of oatmeal, and 
two of potatoes a-week, and their coals led; women get from 
L. 5 to L. 8, with board and lodging ; labourers from Is. to Is. 6d. 
with, and from Is. 6d. to 2s. without victuals ; cartwrights, from 
Is. 6d. to Is. 9d. with victuals. Blacksmiths either charge a cer- 
tain sum for each piece of work, or agree with the farmers at so 
much a-year. 

Cheese. — There are, at an average, about 3600 stones of sweet 
milk cheese annually made in the parish ; of which a great part are 
sold to retail-dealers , the rest to families in Ayr, Maybole, and 
throughout the neighbourhood, and part kept for home consump- 
tion. What is sold to the families is generally coloured, and, for 
the most part, shaped like the Cheshire and Stilton cheeses. The 
average price per stone for the last eight years was 8s. 6d. 

Amount of raw produce. — The average amount of raw produce, 
raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows :

The general duration of leases is nineteen years, a period far too 
limited to promote the improvement of agriculture, and the hap- 
piness and welfare of the farmer. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Village. — Dalrymple is the only village in the parish, and is si- 
tuated on the river Doon, about half way between Ayr and May- 
bole. It formerly consisted of a few thatched cottages huddled 
together round the churchyard ; but about the beginning of this 
century, the Marquis of Ailsa granted feus in a more eligible situa- 
tion, and in a short time the present neat village, which is much ad- 
mired by every stranger, was erected. A carrier from the village 
goes to Ayr every Tuesday and Friday, and returns on the same 
days ; and as there is no post-office in the parish, he carries also 
letters and newspapers. 

MeavsofCo7nmunication. — The London, Edinburgh, and Glas- 
gow mail-coaches to and from Ireland pass every evening, about 
half-past nine or ten, within a mile and a-half of the village ; and 
during a great part of the year, the Ayr and Dumfries stage-coach 
goes on one day and returns on the next, for several miles, through 
the upper part of the parish. 

Ecclesiastical State. — " Of the more early history of the church 
of Dalrymple," says Mr Chalmers in his Caledonia, "research has 
found nothing. When James IV. re-established the chapel-royal 
of Stirling in the beginning of the sixteenth century, he annexed 
to it the church of Dalrymple, the revenues whereof formed one 
of the prebends of that chapel. The cure of the church was in 
the meantime held by a curate. The patronage of the prebend 
of Dalrymple belonged to the King ; and even after the church 
ceased to be connected with the chapel-royal, the King continued 
the patron of the same church." — The present church is pleasant- 
ly situated on the river Doon, at the south-west extremity of the 
parish. It is near the village, but by no means convenient for the 
families in the upper part of the parish, as they are distant from it 
from four to six miles. It was rebuilt on the old foundation in a 
very superficial manner in 1764, and as it is, besides, by far too 
small for the population, it is to be hoped that the land-owners 



DALRYMPLE. 



285 



will in a short time build a new church. Divine service is in ge- 
neral well attended. The Lord's supper is dispensed once a-year, 
and the averaoe number of communicants is 350. The number 
of persons, male heads of families, who have the right of exercis- 
ing the veto, amounts at present to 127. There is no other place 
of worship but the parish church ; and, with the exception of four 
or five Dissenters who came from other parishes, the parishioners 
adhere to the Establishment. Tent-preaching is still kept up here 
on the sacramental Sabbaths. In one of the session records, of 
date 6th June 1808, after mention is made that the sacrament 
was dispensed according to appointment, the following is added : 
" It deserves to be remarked, that there was no sermon at the tent 
at all on this occasion, — a thing that has not occurred in this parish, 
as far as we know, in the memory of any living." 

Manse, Glebe, Sj-c. — The manse was built about the end of last 
century, and a very neat addition was made to it in 1832. The 
glebe consists of 4 acres, and is worth L. 10 per annum. It 
appears from a minute of the Presbytery of Ayr in September 
1701, that the Kirk-hill, consisting of 14 acres, which lets at pre- 
sent for upwards of L. 30, was designed as a grass-glebe to the 
minister ; but, from some unknown circumstance, the ground thus 
designed is now the property of the Marquis of Ailsa. The sti- 
pend is 15 chalders, half meal and half barley, besides L. 8, 6s. 8d. 
for communion elements, and L. 1, 10s. 4d. as an allowance for a 
grass-glebe. The average price of a chalder to the clergy in this 
county for the last seven years, viz. from 1829 to 1835 for the 
 fiars for crop and year 1836 are not yet struck, was L. 14, 13s. 3d. 
Ministers Lf Dalrymple. — The first Presbyterian minister of 
Dalrymple, as far as can be ascertained from the records of the 
Presbytery of Ayr, which go back to 1642, was Mr Robert Spreule, 
who was also Presbytery clerk. How long he was settled before 
that date, and how long he continued, and whether he had any 
immediate successor, is unknown, as some of the records of those 
troublous times are either lost, or were never in existence. In 
1694, Mr James Gilchrist was ordained and admitted minister of 
Dalrymple; in 1699, Mr James Laurie; in 1727, Mr John Adams, 
who was translated to Falkirk in 1744; in 1745, Mr Samuel Wal- 
ker; in 1754, Mr Ebenezer Walker, brother of the former; in 
1798, Mr Robert Steven, minister of Catrine chapel, was admitted; 
and on the 1 9th of February 1829, the present incumbent, Mr

Education. — There are two schools; the parochial, which is si- 
tuated in the village ; and Hollybush school, about the centre of 
the parish. The branches taught at these schools are English 
reading and grammar, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, Latin, 
Greek, French, geography, mathematics, &amp;c. The parochial 
schoolmaster's salary is L. 30, which, with school-fees, L. 25, and 
L. 8 in compensation for a house and garden, and perquisites from 
his office as session-clerk, make his income from L. 60 to L. 70. 

The teacher of Hollybush school has a free school and dwell- 
ing-house, and a good garden from Mr Hunter, the proprietor of 
Hollybush. The average number of scholars at the parochial 
school is 60 ; and at Hollybush school, 45 ; and both schools are 
very well conducted. The parochial school-house was formerly 
at St Valley, a little to the north-east of the village, and now 
forms part of a farm-steading.  

Societies. — Of societies, there are a Friendly Society, a Musical 
Society, a Burns's club, and a curling club. The Friendly Society, 
or, as it is termed, " the Dalrymple Friendly Society," was insti- 
tuted in 1807. According to the articles of this Society, the num- 
ber of members must be sixty ; and if, by the providence of Al- 
mighty God, any member be disabled from work, by sickness or 
any evident misfortune, and judged so by the visiting master, he, 
without any regard to his circumstances, shall receive the sum of 
6s. per week when confined within doors, and when able to walk 
about shall receive 4s. per week ; and when any member dies, the 
surviving members are obliged to contribute each the sum of Is. 
towards defraying funeral expenses, — to attend the funeral, if de- 
sired, — and if there be no relations, the preses is to act as chief 
mourner. 

In 1836, a General Agricultural Association for Ayrshire was 
instituted at Ayr, and the minister and several of the farmers of 
this parish are members of the association. 

Savings Bank. — In May 1831, a savings bank was established 
in Maybole for it and the neighbouring parishes, and, with the ex- 
ception of Maybole, this parish, it seems, has contributed more 
than any of the rest. In the course of that time, there have been 

 It is to this school that Mr Lockhait, the talented biograplier of Burns, alludes 
in his life of the poet. " When Burns," says he, " was about thirteen or fourteen 
years old, his father sent him and Gilbert, week about, during a summer quarter, to 
the parish school of Dalrymple, two or three miles distant from Mount 01iphant,for 
the improvement of their penmanship. The good old man could not pay two fees, or 
h'lH boys could not be spared at the same time from the labour of the fariu."

63 contributors from this parish alone, 36 males and 27 females, 
principally composed, the former of tradesmen and servants, and 
the latter of sewers and servants. The average amount yearly in- 
vested is L. 73, and the amount withdrawn L. 41. This bank has 
had the tendency to give most of the contributors industrious and 
provident habits. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — There are at present 12 persons 
regularly receiving parochial aid ; and the average sum allotted to 
each is 6s. 6d. per month ; there are several also who are supplied 
occasionally according to their necessities ; and three orphans who 
are maintained from the parochial funds. The annual amount of 
contributions for their relief is about L. 70, of which from L. 30 to 
L. 40 arise from church collections, the income from a mortcloth, 
&amp;c. ; and the rest is obtained from the landed proprietors. 

Alehouses. — There are two alehouses in the parish, — one in the 
village, and the other on the road from Ayr to Dalmellinglon, and 
about halfway from both places. 

Fuel.— 'The fuel generally used is coal, brought from the pa- 
rishes of Stair, Coylton, Straiten, and Dalmellington. The dis- 
tance of the nearest coal-pit from Dalrymple village is five miles ; 
and a ton of coals, including carriage and tolls, costs 13s. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
In the former Statistical Account of Dalrymple, Mr Walker men- 
tions that " the lower part of the parish is surrounded by little 
green hills." These hills are now for the most part fruitful fields, 
and yield luxuriant crops of oats, wheat, &amp;c. ; the remainder is 
covered with thriving plantations of all the trees common to this 
country. When the former Account was written, there vsas no wheat 
grown in the parish. This is now, in the lower part, about one-third 
of the grain crop. The fences, which consisted formerly of large 
unshapen stones gathered from the fields, are now in a great mea- 
sure superseded by hedges of thorn, beech, and privet, which, with 
clumps of plantations scattered throughout the parish, give it a 
much more clothed and interesting appearance, and are, moreover, 
highly beneficial in affording shelter to the cattle in wet and stormy 
weather. 

Of upwards of thirty farm-houses and steadings, about one- 
half have been erected in the course of this century, with con- 
siderable taste, and at the same time for the comfort and conve- 
nience of the tenants. They are built of rubble stone, slated, and

rouh-cast, with lime, sand, and gravel. They have each, too, a 
thrashing-mill, driven either by water or horses. 

In the course of this century, that part of the barony of Mar- 
tinham in this parish, consisting of about 500 acres, formerly let 
as a grazing-farm, but without either a house -or a residenter on 
it, has been subdivided into several farms, and has now eleven 
dwelling-houses, inhabited by upwards of seventy souls. 

With the improvements in the parish, the rental has also 
kept pace, having, in the course of thirty years, been more than 
tripled. In 1792, it amounted to L. 1570 Sterling; in 1807, to 
L. 3525 ; and in 1822, to L. 5192. 

In 1736, the number of births was 13; in 1786, 12 ; and in 1836, 
35. In 1736, the collections at church amounted to L. 7 ; in 1786, 
to L. 12 ; and in 1836 to L. 30. 

The line of the projected railway from Ayr to Girvan passes 
through the southern part of this parish.

PRESBYTEHY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. MATTHEW DICKIE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Jsame. — The name of this parish is supposed to be derived 
from two Gaelic words, dun, a fortified height, and luih, a wmd- 
ing, as of a stream. According to local tradition, the Castle of 
Dunlop stood in ancient times on the top of a small eminence, 
still called Dunlop Hill, near the church. As the stream which 
passes Dunlop winds round the base of this hill, a castle so si- 
tuated might have been appropriately called dun-luib, or the forti- 
fied hill at the winding ; and it has been conjectured, that the name 
of this baronial residence was afterwards given to the church, and 
the parochial district annexed to it. 

Extent, Boundaries, c— This parish is of an oblong form. Its 
extreme length from S. W. to N. E. is about 7 miles, and its ge- 
neral breadth nearly 2 miles. At the southern and northern extre- 
mities it becomes much narrower, being for about a mile of length 

3 



UUNLOP. 



289 



at each end, scarcely half a mile broad. It contains about 10| 
square miles of surface. It is bounded on the N. by Neilston ; 
on the N. W. by Beith ; on the S. and S. E. by Stewarton. The 
greater part of it lies in the district of Cunninghame and county of 
Ayr, but on the N. it extends into Renfrewshire. It has been 
alleged that these lands in Renfrewshire, extending to about 1000 
imperial acres, are connected with Dunlop only quoad sacra and 
that, quoad civilian they belong to the parish of Neilston. It has 
never been clearly ascertained whether this is the case or not ; but 
the circumstance of their having paid all parish burdens to Dunlop 
from time immemorial, seems to lead to a different conclusion. 

Tojjographical Appearances. — Though the whole parish is con- 
siderably above the level of the sea,  the ground nowhere rises 
into any eminence that deserves the name of a hill, much less of 
a mountain. Perhaps no height in the parish has an elevation of 
more than 150 feet above the adjacent hollow. The surface of 
the greater part of it is gently undulating. It rises with a gradual 
slope from S. W. to N. E., where it attains its greatest elevation 
in the small hills of Craignaught and Knockmead. In the neigh- 
bourhood of the church, the surface is very uneven, a number of 
low hills, or more properly knolls, being there crowded together 
in a very irregular manner : and in many other places, while the 
low ridges between the streamlets that intersect the parish, slope 
upward on one side with a gentle ascent, they terminate abruptly 
on the other, in steep grassy banks or precipitous rocks. The 
aspect of the country would be inuch improved by additional plan- 
tations. Those already existing, are chiefly on those parts of the 
estates of Dunlop and Caldwell which lie on the confines of the 
parish, so that in the central parts, though almost every farm- 
house has some trees about it, there is not enough of wood to give 
the country a sheltered appearance. From its comparatively ele- 
vated situation, this parish from many points commands a very, 
rich and varied prospect. From Brackenheugh, about a mile to 
the south of the church, the view is particularly grand. The 
highly cultivated and richly wooded district, lying between Dunlop 
and the sea, seems spread out like a map ; the shores of the Frith 
of Clyde, from Ardrossan to the Cairn of Lochryan, with its va- 
rious bays and headlands, are distinctly seen, while the mountains

of Arran, with Ailsa Craig and the hills of Ireland, form the back- 
ground of the scene. 

The temperature of Dunlop is somewhat colder than that of 
the lower parts of the county. This is to be ascribed in part to 
its height above the sea, but chiefly to the wetness of the soil in 
many places, and the want of wood. If the land was thoroughly 
drained, and properly sheltered by plantations, it is thought that 
this evil might in a great measure be got rid of. Persons well 
qualified to judge are of opinion, that the draining already effected 
has done much good in this respect. It is supposed to be owing 
to this, that early autumnal frosts, which were at one time common 
and very hurtful, are now little known. 

The chmate of Dunlop is justly considered very healthy. There 
is no endemical disease in the parish, and it has seldom suffered 
much from the epidemics which, from time to time, have prevailed 
in neighbouring districts. The people in general enjoy excellent 
health, and many of them live to a good old age. At present there 
are nine persons upwards of eighty years of age. Two of these 

are above ninety. 

Hydrography. — Dunlop abounds with springs of excellent water. 
They are all perennial. None of them deserve particular notice, 
on account either of the quantity or quality of their water. 

There is now no lake in the parish, Halket Loch, extending 
to about nine or ten acres, which was the only one, having been 
drained a few years ago, at the joint expense of the proprietors 
whose lands border on it. It is now an excellent meadow. The 
draining of this loch has had the effect of completely preventmg 
the mildew, from which the crops immediately around it formerly 

suffered much. . , • i t . 

The principal stream connected with the parish is the Lugton. 
It rises out of Loch Libo in Renfrewshire, and, after a course of 
about fifteen miles in a south west direction, joins the Garnock near 
Kilwinning. It separates Dunlop from Beith. Corsehill burn 
separates Dunlop from Stewarton. The Glazert, which is joined 
bv a few very small rivulets, drains the centre of the parish, divid- 
ing it into two nearly equal parts. After a course of about ten or 
eleven miles, it falls into the Annack, which is tributary to the 
Irvine. It passes close to the church and village. All these 
streams are very inconsiderable, affording scarcely water enough 
to drive the corn-mills erected on them. 

Geology and Miner alogy.-T\xe prevailing rocks are claystone, 



DUNLOP.

passing into claystone-porphyry and amygdaloid, with subordinate 
masses of greenstone and basalt. These rocks often jut through 
the surface, sometimes forming precipices of considerable height, 
but though many quarries have been opened where they are thus 
exposed, they have not been wrought to such an extent as to show 
their general direction and inclination. Where they break through 
the surface they are often much disintegrated, and are generally 
a confused mass, destitute of regular stratification. The irregular 
seams and fissures running through them, all lie in a direction ap- 
proaching to vertical. At Craighead, near the centre of the parish, 
is a bed of greenstone, composed of seams of different thicknesses, 
which supplies excellent building stones. The depth and extent 
of it have not been ascertained. At Templehouse, near the vil- 
lage, and a few other places, greenstone of good quality is also 
met with. Columnar basalt occurs at Lochridgehills. The co- 
lumns, as far as they have been laid bare by the working of a 
quarry at the place, are about 1 8 feet in height, and 20 inches 
in thickness. They are generally pentagonal, and somewhat 
curved. 

Next to these rocks, limestone is the most abundant. At 
Laigh Gameshill it has long been quarried. This bed is in some 
places about 16 feet thick, and of excellent quality. In other 
places it is of tnuch less value, being thinner, and having many 
layers of indurated clay interspersed. Another bed of limestone 
appears at intervals in the farms of Bourock, East and West Wa- 
terland, on the banks of the Lugton. Very little use has yet been 
made of it. Connected with this limestone, freestone and coal are 
found. They are still almost untouched. A short time ago, a 
few carts of coals were taken out, but they were found to be of 
such inferior quality as not to be worth the expense of extracting 
them. It is not known whether the sandstone and coal are co- 
extensive with the limestone. Besides these two principal beds of 
limestone, there are less extensive masses of it in various other 
places. It everywhere abounds with petrified shells. 

The soil incumbent on all these rocks is generally of a clayey 
retentive nature, but very productive, especially in grass, when 
properly drained. In a few placed, in the southern division of the 
parish, it is loamy, and in the higher grounds patches of moss 
occur here and there. 

Zoology. — Of quadrupeds, the hare, wild rabbit, weasel, and 
mole are common. Roe-deer have for some years past frequented 



292 



AYRSHIRE, 



the woods in the neighbourhood of Caldwell. It is supposed that 
their number does not exceed eight or nine. The fox has nearly 
disappeared, though it is still occasionally seen. 

The following birds are found in great numbers : blackbird, 
thrush, bullfinch, lark, curlew, grey and green" linnet, rail, and 
partridge. The pheasant, missel-thrush, goldfinch, heron, wild- 
duck, teal, and snipe, are to be met with, but they are not nume- 
rous. The starhng, which a few years ago was almost unknown, 
is now very common. 

In the Lugton, pike and trout abound, and the other small 
streams are well stored with burn trouts. The Glazert is said to 
have produced char in former times, but they are not now found 
in it. 

II. — Civil History. 

Accounts of the Parish.— In Robertson's topographical descrip- 
tion of Cunninghame, a short account is given of the parish of 
Dunlop. The author's attention is chiefly directed to family his- 
tory. A series of maps of the different parishes in Cunninghame 
was published a few years ago by Mr Aitken, land-surveyor, Beith. 
These maps are supposed to be very correct. 

Eminent Characters.— Se\era\ persons who have highly distin- 
guished themselves have been connected with this parish by birth 
or residence. The learned John Major or Mair, the instructor 
of Knox, while Professor of Theology at Glasgow, was also vicar 
of Dunlop, in which character it may be supposed he was at least 
occasionally resident in the parish.  

James Hamilton, Viscount Clandeboyes, eldest son of Hans 
Hamilton, Vicar of Dunlop, by his talents and success, reflects 
honour on his native parish. He was sent to Ireland by James 
VI. in the year 1587, along with James Fullarton, to keep 
up a correspondence with the Protestants of that kingdom, and 
communicate intelligence from time to time as to the designs of 
the Irish, in the event of Queen Elizabeth's death. The better 
to conceal their design, they opened a school in Dublin for the 
education of Protestant youth. After teaching privately for se-

veral years, they were appointed to fellowships in Trinity Col- 
lege, then newly founded, and by their talents contributed much 
to establish the high character which it soon acquired. After the 
accession of James to the throne of England, James Hamilton, 
who had discharged his mission to the satisfaction of the King, 
was rewarded by extensive grants of forfeited lands in the county 
of Down and elsewhere ; and after being employed in several im- 
portant services, was at length, in 1622, elevated to the peerage, 
by the title of Viscount Clandeboyes and Baron Hamilton. This 
title became extinct on the death of his grandson, Henry, Earl of 
Clanbrassil. 

Lord Clandeboyes' five brothers having followed him to Ireland, 
shared his good fortune. Their numerous descendants, the Ha- 
miltons of Down, Armagh, Dublin, and Carlow, with their various 
collateral branches, are still possessed of great wealth and influ- 
ence. From them are descended the noble families of Clanbras- 
sil, Roden, Massareene and Dufferin. The first of these titles 
having become extinct through the failure of heirs in the eldest 
branch of Hans Hamilton's family, was granted to one of the de- 
scendants of a younger son, but has again become extinct. Archi- 
bald Hamilton Rowan, so well known from his connection with the 
last Irish rebellion, was the lineal descendant of Hans Hamilton's 
second son, Archibald. 

James Dunlop of that Ilk, and Alexander Dunlop, his son, are 
deserving of notice as warm supporters of the Presbyterian cause 
in the reign of Charles II. Their opposition to the oppressive 
measures of the government, was severely punished by fines and 
imprisonment. -f- 

In later times, several members of this family have been highly 
distinguished in the profession of arms, particularly Lieut.- Gene- 
ral James Dunlop, the last laird. His mother is well known as 
the early friend and correspondent of Burns. 

Land-owners. — The chief land-owners, in the order of their 
valued rents, are, William Mure, Esq. of Caldwell, John Dunlop, 
Esq. of Dunlop, M. P., Richard Trotter, Esq. of Hapland, An- 
drew Brown, Esq. of Hill, and Col. M'Alester of Kennox. 

Parochial 'Registers. — The register of proclamations commences 
in 1700, and that of baptisms in 1701. With the exception of 
two or three short intervals, they have been kept with extreme in-

accuracy till the year 1780, when the late minister entered on 
the charge of the parish. Since that time they have been kept 
with great regularity. 

Antiquities. — The antiquities of Dunlop are not numerous. A 
few years ago, the ruins of a chapel, dedicated to-the Virgin Mary, 
were removed. They stood at a place called Chapelhouse, about 
half a mile from the village. Whether this was the parish church 
before the Reformation, as is conjectured in the former Statisti- 
cal Account, or a chapel distinct from it, as stated in Chalmers' 
Caledonia, is now uncertain. In a field in the neighbourhood, is 
a large detached stone, round which, if tradition is to be, believed, 
it was customary for persons attending at the chapel to perform 
part of their devotions. It is called the " Thugartstane" sup- 
posed to be a corruption of " the grit stane." 

Dunlop House is another relic of former times, which has now 
disappeared. It was taken down about three years ago, to make 
way for the splendid new mansion which its proprietor is now 
erecting. It is thus described in Font's Cunninghame Topogra- 
phized. " Dunlopp, ane ancient stronghouse, fortified vith a deipe 
foussie of watter, and planted with goodly orchards. — It belongs 
to James Dunloppe of that sa.me, and chiefFe of his name." It is 
uncertain when the original square tower, part of which remained 
till the whole building was removed, was erected. One of the 
more modern additions bore the date of 1599. 

Aiket Castle, about a mile south from the church, is now the 
oldest building in the parish. The date of its erection is not ex- 
actly known ; but as a considerable branch of the family of Cun- 
ninghame possessed the property of which it was the mansion, for 
some centuries preceding 1700, about which time it passed into 
other hands, we may assign to it a very respectable antiquity. It 
consisted originally of a square tower, vaulted on the ground 
floor, and four or five storeys high. To this had been added at a 
later date some lower buildings. The appearance of the whole 
has been very much altered, by reducing the tower to the level of 
the annexed buildings. It is still inhabited. 

The only other building that has any claim to antiquity, is a 
small vaulted chamber in the churchyard, in which Hans Hamil- 
ton, the minister of Dunlop, already mentioned, and his wife, are 
buried. There is a very accurate description of it given m the 
former Statistical Account of the parish. 

Modern Buildings.— Tm\o House is the only modern building

that deserves particular notice. It is a magnificent mansion in 
the old English style. The design was furnished by Mr Hamil- 
ton of Glasgow, It stands in a beautifully sequestered situation, 
on the banks of the small stream which separates this parish from 
Stewarton.

The popuation in the month of August 1835 was 1157, of 
whom 572 were males, and 585 females. The demand for la- 
bourers in consequence of agricultural improvements, is the chief 
cause of the increase of population which has so long been going 
on steadily. During last summer, the building of Dunlop House 
and the church, also caused a temporary increase of the population.

One family of independent fortune resides in the parish. The 
number of proprietors of land, of the yearly value of L. 50 and 
upwards, is 37, of whom 23 are resident. The total number of 
heritors is 54. 

" As the registration of births is scarcely ever neglected here, the statement with 
regard to their average number may be 'considered very nearly correct. — It often 
happens that only one of the parties proclaimed resides in the parish. In the above 
estimate, two such proclamations are considered equivalent to one marriage. — As no 
register of deaths is kept, their number cannot be exactly stated. The yearly rate 
of mortality for the three years and a half, during whicli the writer has resided in 
Dunlop, is 22. This is probably somewhat less than the average of a longer period 
would be, as there has till lately been comparatively little sickness in the parish.

AYRSHIRE. 



This minute division of property is not of recent date. From 
an old manuscript valuation of Cunningliame, in the possession of 
John Dunlop, Esq. of Dunlop, it appears that in 1640, the time 
when it was drawn up, there were thirty-three heritors in the pa- 
rish. The property of eight of these is still possessed by their de- 
scendants ; that of the rest has passed into other hands. Of the 
present heritors, several are the representatives of families that 
have possessed the properties they now hold from a remote period. 

Famihj of Dunlop.— The family of Dunlop of that Ilk can be 
traced back to the year 1260, in which year Dom. William de 
Dunlop is incidentally mentioned, in connection with an inquest 
respecting certain lands in litigation between Dom. Godfrey de 
Ross and the burgh of Irvine. The deed is in the charter-chest 
of Irvine. In the Ragman Roll, Neill Fitz Robert de Dunlop, 
who is supposed by Nisbet to be an ancestor of this family, is men- 
tioned as one of the barons who swore fealty to Edward I. of Eno-- 
land in 1296. Since that early period, this family has held the 
estate of Dunlop up to the present time, with the exception of a 
short period about the end of the fourteenth and beginning of the 
fifteenth centuries, when it was forfeited on account, as has been 
conjectured, of the part its representative took in the contest be- 
tween Bruce and Baliol for the Scottish crown.— Nisbet's Heral- 
dry, Vol. ii. and Robertson's Description of Cunninghame. 

Family of Gemmil of Templehouse. — The family of Gemmil of 
Templehouse is also of old standing in this parish. From Pitcairn's 
Criminal Trials, it appears that on the 4th of November 1570, 
Patrik Gemmil of Tempilhouse was one of a jury on the trial of 
" William Cunninghame of Aiket, William Fergushill, Florence 
Crawfurd, and John Raeburn of that Ilk, delatit of the slauchter 
of umql. Johnne Mure of Cauldwell." The property of this family 
has always been small. 

Other Families. — The families of Anderson of Broadlee, Brown 
of Hill, as representative of the Andersons of Craighead, and the 
Dunlops of Hill and Boreland, as well as some others, are of more 
than two centuries standing. 

Character of the People. — It is believed that the people gene- 
rally enjoy in a reasonable degree the comforts as well as the 
necessaries of life. Where labourers have made early and im- 
provident marriages, their circumstances may not in some in- 
stances be so prosperous as could be wished ; but as they have 
good wages and abundant employment, any thing like destitu-

tion among them is unknown. There are no indications of their 
being discontented with their situation. They are distinguished 
for shrewdness in managing their affairs, as well as for persevering 
industry ; and as they generally retain the frugal habits of the 
olden time, many of them have prospered in their worldly circum- 
stances. Though not much given to reading, they have almost 
all a small collection of books, chiefly in divinity. As in other 
places, there are some persons addicted to intemperance, and the 
other grosser vices, but in general they are sober and moral in their 
habits. They are commendably regular in their attendance on di- 
vine ordinances. Family worship, it is alleged, is more neglected 
than in former times, but is still kept up in a considerable propor- 
tion of families. Though the killing of game without a license 
is not looked on as a very heinous offence, especially if the per- 
mission of the proprietor on whose land it is found has been ob- 
tained, poaching is little practised. Smuggling is altogether un- 
known. 

During the last three years there have been 4 illegitimate births. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — According to the information 
received from the different farmers as to the extent of their re- 
spective holdings, it appears that the parish contains 6554 impe- 
rial acres. This estimate can be considered only as a near ap- 
proach to the truth, several of the properties not being measured. 
The land may be thus divided : 

Cultivated or occasionally in tillage, - 5834 imperial acres. 

f Natural pasture, - - 311 

Uncultivated, \ Meadow, - - 248 

Moss, ... 30 

Under wood planted, - - 131 

6554 

With the exception of moss, which would not repay the expense 
of improvement, and meadow, which is more valuable in its present 
state than if it was brought into tillage, almost all the uncultivated 
land consists of steep banks where the plough could not be used, 
so that probably not more than 40 acres of it could be cultivated 
with profit. There is no natural wood. The kinds of trees plant- 
ed are, larch, Scotch fir, ash, elm, beech, and plane. 

The management of the plantations on some of the laro-er 
estates is good, prunmg and thinning, as well as draining and fen- 
cing, being carefully attended to. This cannot be said of the ma- 
nagement oh many of the smaller properties. The plantations on 



298 



AYRSHIRE. 



these are generally narrow belts immediately around the farm- 
houses. From a wish to get as much shelter as possible, with a 
small sacrifice of ground, the trees are often allowed to grow up 
in so crowded a state, that they soon choke each other. There 
are few trees of great age or size in the parish. The largest is a 
plane tree on the farm of Laigh Gameshill. It measures 13 feet 
10 inches in circumference at the height of three feet from the 
ground. 

Rent of Land. — The rent of land cannot be exactly ascertained, 
as more than 1600 acres are in the natural possession of the 
owners. The average rent of that occupied by tenants, which 
being of various qualities, may be considered a fair average 
of the whole, is L. 1 , 4s. per imperial acre. The uncultivat- 
ed land is, on an average, equal in value to that under tillage, 
for though the natural pasture and moss are worth less, the mea- 
dows are worth more. According to this estimate, the rental of the 
parish, if all was in lease, would be L. 7864, 16s. The valued 
rent is L. 4115, 17s. 6d. Scots. 

The average rent of grazing for the summer is, for a milch cow, 
L. 4, 10s. ; for a cow or ox fattening, L. 3, 10s. ; for young cattle 
of different ages, L. 1, 10s. each on the average. The grass of a 
ewe or full-grown sheep for the year costs 15s, 

Rate of Wages, Prices, Sfc. — The rate of wages of farm-labour- 
ers and country artisans varies a little at different times, and ac- 
cording to the qualifications of the persons hired, but for several 
years it has been nearly as follows : man-servant for the year, with 
board and lodging, L. 16; maid-servant, do. do. L. 8; labourers, 
per day, with victuals, in summer, 2s.; in winter, Is, 8d. ; in har- 
vest, 2s. 6d. to 3s. ; females for field-work, per day, with victuals, 
in summer. Is.; in harvest. Is. 6d. to 2s.; tailor, per day, with 
victuals, Is. lOd.; mason and carpenter, in summer, 2s. 6d.; in 
winter, 2s. 

Several kinds of work are occasionally done by the piece. The 
following is a list of the prices usually paid : building ruble wall, 
per rood, exclusive of material, L. 1, 10s. ; plastering per yard, do. 
3d.; building dry stone dikes, per fall, dc. Is. lOd. to 2s.; mow- 
ing meadow hay, per acre, 3s. to 3s. 6d. ; mowing rye-grass hay 
per acre, 2s. 6d. to 2s. 9d. ; reaping oats per acre, 9s. 6d. to 10s. 
6d. ; ploughing, harrowing, and sowing per acre, L. 1, Is. 

Live-stock.— T\\e cattle kept in the parish are of the Ayrshire 
breed. Great attention has long been paid to their improvement, 



DUNLOP. 



299 



and perhaps nowhere is the stock more select. Some persons, en- 
ticed by the high prices given for fine animals, have been too much 
in the habit of selling the best of their young stock, but the prac- 
tice is far from being common. Clydesdale horses, mostly of a 
light description, are generally used. They are almost all bought 
in, very few being reared. The few sheep that are kept are of the 
Leicester breed. The quantity of stock in the summer of 1 835, 
after very minute inquiry, was found to be as follows: 178 horses, 
including 20 young horses; 910 milch cows; 111 cows or oxen 
fattening; 415 young cattle of different ages; 109 sheep; 258 
pigs. 

Husbandry. — Oats is the grain chiefly cultivated. Almost every 
farmer raises barley or bear for the use of his own family, but 
little, if any, for sale. A few acres of wheat have for some time 
past been sown every year, but the success of the experiment has 
not been so great as to cause the cultivation of it to extend much. 
The land being in most places retentive of moisture, turnips are 
not grown to any great extent; and the quantity of potatoes rais- 
ed, except on a few farms, is not much greater than is necessary 
for home consumption. 

The mode of cropping followed in this parish, does not coincide 
with any of the rotations now recommended by writers on agricul- 
ture. When lea is broken up, three crops of oats in succession are 
generally taken from it. With the last crop, rye-grass is sown, 
most frequently without clover. The rye-grass is often allowed to 
ripen its seed, for the purpose of being threshed, and is thus near- 
ly as scourging to the land as an additional corn crop. The ground 
is then allowed to lie in pasture for at least four or five, and some- 
times even for ten or twelve years, when the same course of crop- 
ping is again repeated. Potatoes and turnips, so far as the cul- 
tivation of them extends, take the place of the second crop of 
oats, and on a part of the ground which has borne potatoes, the 
wheat and barley that are raised, are sown. In some instances, 
only two crops of oats are taken, and this practice is gradually ex- 
tending. In these cases, a small field is sometimes set apart for rais- 
ing potatoes, turnips, barley, &amp;c. which do not come into the ordi- 
nary rotation of the farm. This system of management, it may be 
thought, must tend greatly to impoverish the soil ; but, owing part- 
ly to its natural fertility, and partly to the pains taken to keep it in 
good heart, by liming and top-dressing, it is not found to suffer from 
it. It is a very common practice to top dress the ground with dung, 



300 



AYRSHIRE, 



soon after it lias been laid down in grass, and again to lime it a 
year or two before it is to be ploughed up. The reason why this 
system of cropping, which has long since been given up in the 
more improved districts of the country, is persevered in here, is, that 
the cultivation of green crops is thought to hurt the pasture, on 
which the farmer places his chief dependence. It is customary 
here to plough with three horses. In defence of this practice, it is 
alleged that as much additional work is done by using three instead 
of two, as fully to cover the extra expense. This is very doubtful. 

The dairy has long been the chief object of attention in Dun- 
lop. Dunlop cheese has justly obtained a very high character. 
The cheese made here, as well as in other parts of the country, 
was made of skimmed milk, till about the end of the seventeenth 
century, when one Barbara Gilmour,  introduced the practice of 
using the whole milk. This practice for a time was confined to 
this parish and its immediate neighbourhood, but it has gradually 
extended to almost every part of the west and south of Scotland. 
All the cheese made in these districts, with unskimmed milk, still 
goes under the general name of Dunlop, that being the name by 
which cheese of this quality was originally known. It is not now 
pretended that what is made here is superior to that of other places, 
but it is nowhere excelled. The average quantity made during 
the season from each cow's milk is about 27 stones of 14 lbs. 
avoirdupois, or 24,570 stones from the whole parish. In some 
small dairies, each cow has been known to produce on an average 
42 stones. A good many calves are reared every year, a part of 
which are kept to uphold the original stock, and the rest sold when 
two or three years old. Pigs are now also a source of some profit 
to the farmer, being kept in considerable numbers to consume the 

refuse of the dairy. 

For a long time, draining, though much needed, was very little 
attended to, but of late it has been carried on with much spirit. 
The importance of this improvement is now fully understood, and 
where adequate encouragement is given by the landlord, lea is sel- 

 It is mentioned in the last Statistical Account, that she had learned this mode of 
making cheese in Ireland, where she had gone during the trouhles of Charles 1 1, s 
ieiirn. Inhere seems to be no reason to deny her claim to the honour of having in- 
troduced this improved manufacture, but it is at least very doubtful whetlier she nn- 
,o, ted the improvement from Ireland. Ireland has never been noted as a cl,eese pro- 
dudn- country, and the little that is now made there, is barely eatable. Mr Brisbane 
mendT,ned to the writer of this Account, that his only reason for supposmg that 
Sllfmode of making cheese had been learned in Ireland, was, that Barbara Gilmour 
]jad introduced it soon after her return from tliat country.

dom ploughed up without being previously drained. The conse- 
quence is, that the rushes, sprits, and other coarse and worthless 
herbage, which formerly gave such a waste appearance to the coun- 
try, are gradually disappearing, and the land is rendered much 
more productive both in grass and corn. Much still remains to be 
done in this way, as it is computed that not more than a fourth-part 
of the parish has yet been gone over. On the Dunlop estate, where 
landlord and tenant pay equal parts of the expense, nearly a-half 
has been drained. The system of draining adopted here is fur- 
row-draining. In every furrow a trench is dug, about 18 inches 
deep, and 8 or 9 inches wide at the bottom. This is half-filled 
with broken stones, of which there is almost everywhere an abun- 
dant supply. Where tiles are used instead of stones, in forming 
the water course, the trench is not made either so deep or so wide. 
The average expense of draining is about L. 4 per acre. Where 
the furrows have been laid dry, a few attempts have been made to 
level and straighten the high crooked ridges, but this practice is 
yet only in its infancy. 

The general duration of leases is from sixteen to nineteen years. 
Rents are usually a fixed sum of money. On the Dunlop estate, 
the rent is a stipulated quantity of cheese, convertible into money 
at the prices given for it in Glasgow market, on certain specified 
days. This mode of payment is very satisfactory to the tenant. 
In all leases, tenants are bound to plough only a fourth of their 
ground each year. This restriction seems to be very unnecessary, 
as few of them seem inclined to cultivate as much as they have 
leave to do. 

Some of the older farm steadings are exceedingly paltry and 
incommodious ; those more recently erected are neat and comfort- 
able, though, as the farms are small, the accommodations are not 
extensive. Many of the smaller heritors have erected substantial 
and convenient houses on their farms. The whole parish is now 
enclosed, partly with stone dikes, partly with hedge and ditch. 
The hedges are often very indifferently kept. 

Quarries. — On the farm of Laigh Gameshill, a limestone quar- 
ry has long been wrought. About 5000 bolls are taken from it 
annually, part of the stone being burnt on the spot, and part taken 
away by the farmers in an unburnt state, to be prepared at home. 
Limestone is raised in several other parts of the parish, but as. it 
is quarried by the farmers, on whose land it is found, for their own 
use, no account of the quantity raised can be given. Quarries

Cheese-Dealers. — Besides the cheese produced in the parish of 
Dunlop, a large proportion of what is manufactured in other parts 
of Ayrshire, passes through it on its way to the consumer. Being 
a convenient entrepot between the producing country to the south 
and west, and Glasgow, Paisley, and the neighbouring villages, a 
considerable number of persons follow the business of cheese-deal- 
ers or cheese cadgers, as they are commonly called, purchasing it 
from the farmers, and supplying the victuallers in the manufactur- 
ing districts. Several persons engaged in this traffic have amassed 
considerable property. Though not now so profitable a business 
as formerly, it is still sufficiently so to induce many to carry it on. 
Fourteen persons in this parish are at present engaged in it. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

Marltet-Toions.—'Vhe nearest market-towns are Kilmarnock 
and Irvine, the former eight, and the latter nine miles distant from 
the village of Dunlop. In an opposite direction, Paisley at the 
distance of 12, and Glasgow of 16 miles, are excellent markets 
for the sale of agricultural produce. Dunlop is the only village in 
the parish. It consists of one street, and contains at present 284 
inhabitants. 

Means of Communication.— T\\Q nearest post-office is Stewar- 
ton, 2i miles distant. A runner is despatched to it every day for 
the Dunlop letters. The parish is well supplied with roads. The 
turnpike road from Kilmarnock to Paisley runs through it for five 
miles, and a branch of this road leading to Neilston, for about four 
miles more. There are besides about fourteen miles of parish roads, 
made and repaired by the statute labour. They are generally kept

in very good order, and are well laid out for the accommodation 
of the parishioners. A coach from Irvine to Glasgow passes and 
repasses every lawful day, close to the village. Bridges have been 
built wherever they were needed, which are all kept in good repau-. 

Ecclesiastical State.— i:\ie church, which is the only place of wor- 
ship in the parish, is conveniently situated for the greater part of the 
population. It is about two miles and ahalf from the southern extre- 
mity, and a little more than four from the northern. The old church 
having become too small for the increased population, the heritors 
last spring 1835, agreed to erect a new one. The building was 
begun without delay, and, though not quite finished, was opened 
for public worship in December. It is a handsome and commo- 
dious edifice, capable of accommodating about 750 persons. In 
the old church, each heritor had sittings proportioned to his valu- 
ed rent, which he divided, rent free, among his tenants. The table 
seats alone were not allocated in this way. These, reserving four 
sittings for the paupers, who very seldom occupied them, were an- 
nually let by roup to the highest bidder, and on account of the 
want of room, generally brought extravagant prices. Ten shil- 
lings have sometimes been paid for a single sitting. The new 
church is divided in a similar manner ; but, as it affords more ac- 
commodation than the parish in its present state requires, those 
who have no sittings from being occupiers of land, are able to pro- 
cure them at a reasonable rate, seldom exceeding a shilling for a 
sitting. 

The manse was built in the year 1781. A considerable addi- 
tion was made to it in 1814. It contains a good deal of room, 
and when the alterations now in progress are completed, will be a 
comfortable and convenient house. 

The extent of the glebe is about 7 acres. Nearly 4 acres of it 
are arable. The remainder consists of steep banks, which are fit 
only for pasture. It is worth about L. 14 a year. The stipend 
is 14 chalders, one-half oat-meal, and the other barley, converti- 
ble into money at the fiar prices of the county. The average 
value for the last seven years has been L. 215, 4s. The allow- 
ance for communion elements is L. 8, 6s. 8d. 

Of the 222 families in the parish, 215 attend the Established 
church, and 7 attend dissenting places of worship in the neighbour- 
"hood. The total number of Dissenters is 26, including those who 
live as servants in families, the heads of which belong to the Es- 
tabhshed Church. Of these, 15 are connected with the United

The parish church is remarkably well attended. The general 
complaint for a long time has been, that many persons could not 
attend for want of room. The average number of communicants 
is 360. 

 The chutch of Dunlop belonged in former times to the Abbey of Kilwinning, 
the monks enjoying the rectorial tithes, and appointing a vicar for the performance 
of the spiritual duties. In Bagimont's Roll, as it stood in the reign of James V., the 
vicarage of Uunlop, in the deanery of Cunninghame, was taxed at L. 3, Gs. 8d., being 
a tenth of the estimated value. Caledonia.  It is not known at what time it was 
erected into a parochial charge. The earliest notice I find of it is in the chartulary 
of Paisley, from which it appears that in 1265, " Johnde Reston was perpetual vicar 
of the parish church of Dunlop. In 1505, Sir Andrew Marshall, the vicar of Dun- 
lop, was chamberlain to the Archbishop of Glasgow, and one of the vicars-general of 
the archbishopric. John Major, Professor of Theology in Glasgow, already referred 
to, appears to have been vicar of Dunlop from 1318 till 1323. From that period, 
till the time of the Reformation, when the vicarage was held by Mr John Houston, 
1 have not been able to learn any particulars concerning my clerical predecessors. 

Hans Hamilton, son of Hamilton of Raplocli, appears to have been the first Pro- 
testant minister of this parish. It is stated in the inscription on his tombstone, and 
the monument which his son erected to his memory, that he died in 1608, after hav- 
ing served the cure at this church forty-five years. He must therefore have entered 
on this charge in 1563. In the " register of ministers, exhorters, and readers, and of 
their stipends after theperiod of the Reformation, "lately published by the Maitland Club, 
there is the following entry with regard to Dunlop : " John Hamilton, vicar andcx- 
horter, the thryd of the vicarage extending to xxvi. li. prodding he wait on his charge 
beltym 1567." The only way I know of reconciling this extract with what was pre- 
viously stated, is by supposing that John Hamilton is the same person with Hans 
Hamilton, Hans being only an abbreviation of Johannes. Hans Hamilton was suc- 
ceeded in the charge by Hew Eglinton, who died in 1 646. As the records of Pres- 
bytery during the time of his incumbency are lost, little is known about him- From 
an incidental notice in the record of the Presbytery's proceedings at a subsequent 
period, it appears that he was under process at the time of his death, but the 
cause of the process is not specified. In 1648, two years after the death of 
Hew Eglinton, Gabriel Cunninghame was settled. He was ejected in 1663, and 
restored again by the indulgence of 1672, when Mr William Mein was associated 
with him in the charge of the parish. After this he seems to have fallen under 
the suspicion and displeasure of the government, for on the 2d of April 1083, he 
was indicted, along with some others, " for aiding, assisting, and corresponding 
with Mr John Cunninghame, late of Bedlane, a notorious traitor." Failing to 
appear, " he was denounced and put to the horn, and his moveable goods ordered 
to be escheat, and brought into his Majesty's use, as an outlaw and a fugitive." 
He is mentioned by Wodrow, as having lived till after the Revolution ; but whether 
he was restored to his charge before that period does not appear. He seems to have 
been a person of considerable eminence, and to have taken a prominent part in the de- 
liberations of the Presbyterian ministers in those distracted times. — Wodrow, i. 352,

Education. — There are at present four schools in the parish, one 
of which is parochial. The branches of education taught in the 
parish school are, English reading, writing, arithmetic, book-keep- 
ing, practical mathematics, and Latin. The same branches are 
taught in the private schools, with the exception of practical ma- 
thematics and Latin. Theparish schoolmaster's salary is L.27, 16s. 
including L. 2, 2s. 9d. in lieu of garden. The school fees amount 
on an average to about L. 17 a year. The school-house was built 
in the year 1641, as appears from the following inscription over 
the door : 

" 1641. 

" This school is erected and endowed by James, Viscount Clane- 
boyes, in love to his parish, in which his father, Hans Hamilton, 
was pastor 45 years, in King James the Sixt his raigne. 

I-LV." 

It is still in pretty good repair ; but though it affords to the 
schoolmaster what may be called legal accommodation, it does not 
afford such accommodation as a well-qualified teacher ought to 
have. If, as the inscription intimates, the school was ever en- 
dowed by Lord Claneboyes, all knowledge of the scource whence 
the endowment was derived is now lost.

In this parish children are generally sent to school, when they 
are between five and six years of age, and kept at it, with occa- 
sional interruptions in seed time and harvest, till they are about 
thirteen. In the month of November 1834, an inquiry was made 
as to the number of children attending school, for the purpose of 
making out the returns on the state of education, ordered by 
the House of Commons. It was then found that 164 were at 
school, all day scholars, and that only one individual above fif- 
teen could not read. She had come here a few months before as 
a servant, and has since gone away. These circumstances suffi- 
ciently shew that the people in general are alive to the importance 
of education, and disposed to avail themselves of the opportunities 
of obtaining it. The establishment of a school at the distance of 
about a mile and a half from the upper end of the parish, would

be of very great irtiportance to the families in that district, as the 
children out of a population of fully 300, residing from two to four 
miles from the parish school, would then have the means of educa- 
tion within a moderate distance. Hitherto the schools in that 
quarter have seldom remained long in one place. A few neigh- 
bouring farmers have usually engaged a young lad to teach their 
children, some one of them providing a school-room. Whenever 
his family grew up, the school of course was removed to another 
house. 

Libraries. — There are two libraries ; one, called the Sabbath 
School Library, from having been established at first in connec- 
tion with a Sabbath school, contains about 250 volumes, chiefly 
in religious biography and practical divinity. It is open to all 
the parishioners gratis. The other is a subscription library, esta- 
blished in 1828. It now contains about 110 volumes, in general 
literature. 

Friendhj Society.— K friendly society was estabhshed hereabout 
twenty-three years ago, whose object is to afford rehef to sick and 
aged members. It has hitherto prospered. There is reason to 
think that it has had a good effect in cherishing feelings of inde- 
pendence. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for the last seven years is 12, and the ave- 
rage allowance of each during the same time L. 5, 4s. a year. In 
addition to their stated aliment, some of them have an allowance 
for fuel and house rent. The total sum expended annually has 
amounted on an average of seven years to L. 71, 18s. 

The average income for the last seven years has been L. 63, 17s. 3d. 
arising from the following sources, viz. Church collections,  
L. 36, 4s. lOd.; proclamations, L. 1, 7s.; mortcloth dues, 
L. 1, 10s. 8d. ; interest of money formerly saved, L. 24, 14s. 9d. 

total, L. 63, 17s. 3d. , j , • 

It thus appears that the expenditure has exceeded the mcome 
by L. 8, Os. 9d. a year. This deficiency has been supplied, by 
taking from the money at interest as much as was necessary to 
meet current expenses ;-a mode of supporting the poor, the pro- 
priety of which is very questionable. It may be proper to men- 

 Under the head of church collections, are included contributions by a few non- 
rcsidSclrs.hey are put under this head, because they are sent 
ly or monthly, as collection, by the hands of some of their tenants. 1 hese cont. 
butions amount at present to about L. 8, 8s. a year.

tion, that for nearly two years past none of our accumulated mo- 
ney has been taken to make up deficiencies. The average num- 
ber of poor has not increased for many years past ; and though it 
has risen from eight to twelve since the date of the last Statisti- 
cal Account, yet this is not more than keeping pace with the in- 
creased population. There is still a general unwillingness to be 
dependent on parochial aid ; although a few, who are by no means 
proper objects of charity, are clamorous enough. 

Fairs. — Two fairs for the sale of dairy stock are held annually 
at Dunlop, — one on the second Friday of May, old style, and the 
other on the 12th of November. Tliey are both well attended. 

Inns, Alehouses, Sfc. — A very respectable inn has been built at 
Lugton bridge, on the road from Irvine to Glasgow. Besides 
this there are six houses in which spirituous liquors are sold. One- 
half of them might, with benefit to the public, be suppressed. It 
is found that wherever a public-house is opened, some persons in 
the neighbourhood fall into dissipated tippling habits, which other- 
wise they might have avoided. 

Fuel — Coal is the only fuel used. It is chiefly brought from 
the neighbourhood of Kilmarnock and Irvine. The pits at both 
these places are about seven miles distant from the village, where 
coals can be laid down at 12s. per ton, including the expense of 
carriage. 

A pit has lately been opened in the parish of Beith, at a dis- 
tance of three miles from Dunlop. If the coal should prove to be 
of good quality, it will be of very great advantage to this part of 
the country.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

REV. ROBERT HOUSTON, A. M. MINISTER. 



1. Topography and Natural History. 

Jslame. This parish is called in the former Statistical Account, 

Damelingtoun, and the name is still retained in this form by many 
of the old inhabitants. The orthography, however, has not been 
uniform, but has passed, through various unimportant changes. In 
its present shape, the etymology of the name can be easily traced 
to a very appropriate Gaelic origin, Dail, signifying a plam, or 
field, or valley, and Muileann, a mill, with the very common affix 
ton; the name will therefore signify the town of the valley of the 
mill, or of the mill field. Dalmellington is a burgh of barony. 
The date of its erection I have not been able to ascertam. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The parish, as nearly as can be es- 
timated, is 10 miles long, and on an average fully 3 miles 
broad. In the absence of any correct measurement of its surface, 
it may with tolerable accuracy be assumed to be 30 square miles. 
The boundaries of the parish are the Loch and River Doon on 
the south and south-west, separating it from the parish of fetrai- 
ton in the district of Carrick ; Dalrymple parish on the west ; 
Ochiltree on the north ; and New Cumnock and Carsphairn, in the 
stewartry of Kirkcudbright, on the east. • , • ,  

Topographical Jppearances.-The figure of the parish is that of 
an obtuse triangle, the longest side of which is the Loch and River 
Doon A perpendicular from this, about half a mile above the 
middle of the parish, where its breadth is the greatest, and passing 
through the village, would measure about five miles, and termi 
nate nearly at the meeting of Ochiltree and New Cumnock pa- 

Surface.— The upper part of the parish is formed by the termi- 
nation of three ranges of hills, which form ridges of varying though 
but moderate elevation. Two of these run nearly parallel from the 
march of Carsphairn, in a north and north-west direction, the one

being a continuation of the lofty ridge on the east side of Loch 
Doon, and the other rising from the foot of Cairnsmuir. The 
third ridffe is from New Cumnock, and crosses the foot of one of 
the others. Its direction is nearly south-west. The lower part 
of the parish is nearly one entire ridge of eminences, terminating 
abruptly to the east, and receiving at its different elevations the 
names of Benwhat, Benbraniachan, and Benbeoch. The only 
flat land in the parish is between this ridge and the Doon. It 
may be a mile in breadth just below the village, and extends about 
three miles along the Doon, terminating in a point in both direc- 
tions. The hills are chiefly of easy ascent. In three places only 
are they for short distances precipitous. Benbeoch terminates 
the lower ridge to the east in a range of magnificent basaltic co- 
lumns, nearly 300 feet in height, and double that extent in breadth. 
Along the road to Carsphairn the Dumfries road for fully a mile, 
the ridges on either side approach so near as to form a deep pass, 
through which there is space for only the road and a narrow stream 
to wind themselves. A still more precipitous pass presents itself 
on the other side of the extremity of the Loch Doon range, where 
the river issues from the loch. There, for a mile, the rocky per- 
pendicular precipices approach within thirty feet of each other, and 
at some points rise 300 feet above the bed of the river. This is 
a favourite resort of the tourist of the lochs. A footpath was 
made by a late proprietor along the south side of the river, and 
just about the height of its winter torrents. Its present proprie- 
tor, whose residence is but a few hundred yards from the foot of 
the glen, has contrived to beautify it as much as its rocky gran-, 
deur will admit of ; but its rude natural sublimity, and the deafening 
dashing of the white torrent along its rocky bed, will ever remain 
its grand attraction, and make its minor beauties almost unknown 
and unheeded. This pass, which has given to it the name of the 
Glen of Ness, or the Craigs of Ness, is the beginning of the val- 
ley of the Doon, which farther down widens out into rich and ex- 
tensive meadows. Looking up the valley from near the foot of 
the parish, the flat land presents the enclosed figure of a triangle, 
widening out before the eye, till it reaches the high land above 
the village, beyond which the mountains of Galloway close the 
prospect. The village, which lies imbedded in a sheltered nook 
at the north-east corner of the meadow land, is estimated to be 
400 feet above the level of the sea. The highest of the surround- 
ing hills amounts not to above 750 feet more,

Meteorohgy. — Notliing can be said, in the absence of all regular 
and registered observations, of the positive temperature and pressure 
of the atmosphere. Without doubt it partakes of the greater cold- 
ness of elevated regions, and is more variable than in lower districts, 
but no peculiar influence of it can be discovered in the distempers 
that occur. The inhabitants are hardy, healthy, and long-lived. 
It is now but a tradition that the climate was once very unhealthy, 
especially to children. This was charged upon a piece of marshy 
ground in the neighbourhood of the village. Whether the cause 
of this traditionary unhealthiness may have been to be found in 
the marsh, and its removal in the partial draining of it, I shall 
not take it upon me to determine, but certain it is the diseases 
of children are now very rare. Croup, that enemy said to have 
scourged them, is seldom seen. There is not a single distemper 
peculiar to the district, or referable to the climate. There is 
occasionally a case of rheumatism, but even rheumatism, notwith- 
standing of the elevated situation, and the almost constant expo- 
sure of many of the inhabitants, is not at all prevalent. The visits 
of epidemics are few and short. The estimated time of the return 
of measles, small-pox, &amp;c. is from seven to ten years. 

Hydrography The springs in the parish are all perennial. 

Their temperature varies little from that of the atmosphere. They 
flow chiefly from beds of sand and gravel, and are pure. There 
are a few chalybeate springs in the neighbourhood. 

There is a small loch, named Loch Muck, scarce a mile from 
the south-east boundary of the parish. Its waters are dark, and 
of considerable depth. Its form is that of a crescent, and its ex- 
tent between twenty and thirty acres. It lies in the middle of a 
heathy muir, and abounds in black trout. Another sheet of 
water, about double the extent, has received the name of the 
Bogton Loch. It is formed by the spreading out of the Doon, 
over a piece of low land, about two miles below its source. It is 
fertile in reeds, and forms a favourite haunt of the water-fowl. 
" The only river worth notice is the far-famed Doon, — all others 
are but little streams, although occasionally in winter they ap- 
proach the river size. The Doon, which separates the dis- 
tricts of Kyle and Carrick, flows out of the loch of the same 
name. Its exit from the loch is by two tunnels cut out of the 
solid rock, and protected by sluices, by which the discharge of 
water is regulated. Its direction during its course along the 
boimds of this parish is north-west. Its whole length may be 18

DALMELLINGTON. 



311 



miles ; its breadth 40 feet ; its depth varies considerably, being 
from 2 to '20 feet. Except when dashing through the Glen of 
Ness, its course is through an almost level meadow, where it forms 
nearly one continued pool of deep dark water. • Its temperature 
is much the same as that of the atmosphere. In its course through 
the parish, it receives the additional waters of several small streams, 
by which its frequent overflowings are chiefly occasioned, and dis- 
charges itself into the sea about two miles south of Ayr. 

Geology The chief of the rocky materials of the parish are 

graywacke and sandstone, chiefly of the coal formation. For three 
miles from the head of the parish, and across all its breadth, no- 
thing is visible but the graywacke, which extends into Galloway. 
The remaining seven miles are sandstone, in seams of various 
thicknesses, with everywhere an abundance of coal, and occasion- 
ally lime and ironstone. The only exception to the universality of 
this statement, is in the case of the higher part of the ridge termi- 
nated by the basaltic columns of Benbeoch, already mentioned. 
This trap range is evidently of igneous origin, and cuts off" the coal 
field of the parish, which is upon the south edge of the great coal 
valley of the lowlands, from the more extensive tract which pro- 
ceeds through the northern part of the county to Renfrew and La- 
narkshire. The effects of the eruption of the basalt by which this 
ridge has been produced are manifest in the disturbed state of the 
incumbent strata. Where the sandstone has been exposed, it ex- 
hibits a succession of thin layers of blue clay and coal alternating 
with it, with, in the lower formations, an occasional stratum of the 
softer kind of common argillaceous schist. 

The direction and dip of the strata exhibit almost every variety. 
The sandstone varies chiefly in the direction, and the graywacke in 
the dip. The dip of the-sandstone and its accompanying strata in 
the lower ridge of hills, as seen in the coal-pits at the extremities 
of it, is 1 foot in 6 or 7. At the south-east end, the direction is 
nearly west, whereas at the other it is north-east. In the sandstone 
above the village, the dip is 6 feet in 11, and the direction north- 
west. The graywacke that succeeds it, in going south-east, dips in 
the opposite direction, and varies greatly on opposite sides of the 
little stream that divides the two ridges ; on the south-west side, be- 
ing as much as 4 feet in 1, and nearly uniform, — whereas on the 
north-east side it varies, and is no more than from 3 feet in 4, to 
4 in 3. The bed is nowhere exposed between the graywacke and 
sandstone, to enable one to discover what rock separates tliem.

AYRSHIRE. 



About half a-mile below the village, is the morass mentioned in 
the former report. It is 150 acres of peat resting on a spongy bot- 
tom. Several oaks have been found imbedded in it. Two of a 
considerable size are just now exposed, about 6 inches below the 
surface, in crossing a ditch. They measure respectively 3 feet and 
3i feet in diameter. Others were found nearer the village thirty 
years ago. 

The soil along the river side is chiefly a deep loam. Upon the 
hill sides, in the lower half of the parish, it is a wet clayey loam rest- 
ing on sandstone, and terminating at the back of the ridge, in 
a broad moss extending for miles into Ochiltree parish. The up- 
per part of the parish is chiefly a light dry soil, with a few patches 
of peat resting on the graywacke rock. The ordinary plants are 
common grass and fog. There is some heath upon the high lands 
to the south-east, but it is every year lessening in extent. 

The coal-pits have been many, — especially in low situations, where 
till lately the coal was worked at less than 3 fathoms from the sur- 
face. The pits at present in operation are two ; — one, the Cam- 
larg pit, about a mile from the village, is nearly 20 fathoms deep. 
Two seams of coal are there worked together, the lower seam 
3 feet deep, and the higher 22 inches. They are separated by 
16 inches of a black soft stuff the colliers very appropriately deno- 
minate dirt. Immediately above and below the coal, is freestone 
mixed with coal. 

The other pit is about five miles distant at the foot of the parish, 
and is worked by a steam-engine. The following is an official re- 
port of the depth, &amp;c. of it : Blue clay, 66 feet ; freestone, 70 
feet ; smithy coal, 3 feet ; fire clay, 1 foot ; hard fire-coal, 8 feet ; 
fire-clay, 4 feet; hard fire-coal, 4 feet; total, 156 feet. 

Zoology. — The wild animals are such as are the ordinary inha- 
bitants of mountain districts, and which are carefully specified in 
the game acts. Black game have been abundant for the last twenty 

 The manner of raising the coals from this pit deserves notice and imitation also, 
where similar facilities are possessed. The pit is dug in the side of a hill, and has the 
direction of a small stream turned to its mouth. It is divided into two square com- 
partments, to which water-tight boxes, partly open above, are fitted, and upon which 
the coal creels are placed. The full creels are raised by running a sufficient quantity 
of water into the box at the top, upon which the emjity creel is placed. The water 
escapes from the box by a valve in the bottom of it. Tliis valve is opened by an iron 
peg fitted to it, striking against a stone at the bottom of the pit, and tlie water runs 
off into a level or t\nmel to the stream at the foot of the hill. The motion is regulated 
by means of a lever pressed upon the wheel over which tiie rope passes. The appa- 
ratus is the simplest and safest possible, is managed with the greatest ease, and has 
worked njost successfully.

years. Wild ducks abound in the Bogton loch, and frequently tempt 
the eagle from the Star mountains to a comfortable meal. That 
beautiful little bird the teal also frequents the loch. The loch is also 
adorned from October to March with flocks of wild swans, which 
make it their resting-place duringthe winter. The bittern, commonly 
called from its ominous sound, the bull of the bog, was in former 
days also to be found on the loch. Foxes were wont to be very 
abundant in the parish. Certain caves, formed by the fallen co- 
lumns of Benbeoch, aff'orded them strong hiding-places, whence 
they issued, and committed frightful havoc among the flocks and 
poultry. By dint of persevering efforts they were entirely extir- 
pated ; but within these two or three years, certain stray ones have 
reached the old abodes. 

Botany. — The rarest plants noticed in this parish are the fol- 
lowing : Agrostis pumila, Holcus mollis, Melica uniflora, Festuca 
vivipara, Scirpus setaceus, Gnaphalium sylvaticum, Nymphcea alha, 
Solidago virgaurea, Stachys ambigua, Saxifraga hypnoides. On 
Benbeoch is found abundance of the beautiful Cryptogramma 
crispa, and in the Glen of Ness the Polypodium dryopteris, As- 
plenium viride and Trichomanes, Aspidium lobatum, and ,3. lonchi- 
tidoides, Hymenophyllum Wilsoni, are frequent; and also, in beau- 
tiful fructification, abundance of the Neckera crispa and Hook- 
eria lucens. 

II. — Civil History. 
The most ancient account of parish transactions is to be found 
in the session-records. The first date of them is 7th March 1641. 
For twenty-one years they were exceedingly well kept, and very 
voluminous, and again for the same period at the beginning of 
the last century ; and give a striking picture of the times in the acts 
embodied in them, and the vigilance and extent of the disciphne 
they bear to have been exercised. For a century after the last date, 

 A session of these ancient days would have shamed the scanty muster of modern 
times. The list of session in 1641 is given at the beginning of the record. It was 
made up of the minister, fourteen elders, four deacons, and the clerk, to whom seem 
to have been added at a future period other two elders and four deacons. And this 
in a parish in which in 1755 there were but 739 idhabitants. The following ex- 
tracts will shew the style and character of ecclesiastical enactments in these days 
The following is of date 21st March 1641, and is intituled " Act anent Egyptians 
' The qlk day it was enacted, yt if any xnihm the sd paroclioune sal resett or cnter- 
teinany vagabounde, especially those who be called Egyptians, they sal pay of penalty 
5 lib." The following " Act anent Sabbatt breaking" is also of the same date " The 
qlk day it was also enacted, that if any sould be fund absent from the kirk upoun 
the Lord's day, or any other way be prophaning the same, that they sould stand in 
the public place of repentance, and pay of penalty ane mk." Standing in sarkcloU.

there is little record of session proceedings. The register of births 
and marriages begins at the same date, and, except during " the 
time of the curate," as the last period of the Episcopacy is usually 
designated, all the records of which are a few scarce readable en- 
tries of baptisms, it has been, with little interruption, well kept to 
the present day. 

This parish bore its full share of the hardships of the times of 
persecution. The traditionary records of these times are by no 
means scanty ; but a narrative still more full and better authenti- 
cated will be found in Wodrow. He gives the history of this 
parish as a specimen of what was generally practised, and says, 
" Had materials come to my hand as distinctly from the rest of 
the country as from this parish, what a black view we might have 
had." He details minutely the great number of troops frequently 
quartered upon the people. In 1678 they had 900 Highlanders 
quartered upon them ; a number which, judging from the earliest 
census we possess, was more than the whole population of the pa- 
rish. As a specimen of the fines levied for worshipping in inter- 
dicted places, he gives a list of ten individuals who had to pay, in 
the portions severally specified, 600 merks and 260 lib. for hear- 
ing a sermon in the chapel in Straiton parish. And this besides 
the imprisonment of some of them, and the dispersing of the 
family, and the plundering of the house of one who did not appear. 
Wodrow quotes frequently and at great length from the diary of 
Quintin Dick, an inhabitant of this parish, who bore a prominent 
part both in the sufferings and in the doings of these days. In 
such exciting times he was a remarkable instance of sound judg- 
ment, steadfast principle, and moderation. After much suffering, 
and a long imprisonment in Dunottar Castle, he providentially 
escaped banishment to the Plantations, to which he had been sen- 
judgment. We apprehend that the chureh, upon its re-establishment after the Re- 
volution, found society in a sadly disorganized state, — for the session records, for 
some time subsequent to that date, show the exercise of a very strict discipline over 
all kinds of ofFenders. Drunkenness, profane swearing, and " Sabbatt breaking," were 
resolutely rebuked and repressed. All unnecessary work which might be conveniently 
done on the Saturday, such as " cutting of kail and carrying in of water," were pro- 
hibited. Two elders in their turn searched the town, and looked after strollers in 
the fields during divine service. A week day service was maintained, and it was en- 
acted on the '26th October 1708, " That there should be no market keeped, by sell- 
ing of meal and other commodities in time of Divine service upon the week day." No 
drinking was permitted in public-houses on any night after the ringing of the bell. 
One extract more, strikingly indicative of the interest in all beneficial undertaknigs, 
the Kirk of Scotland has ever taken. On the Ifith May 1658, a collection was made 
for " the harbour of Kirkadie, the bridge of Carsphairne, and the kirk ot Kirkbride." 
The sum collected was " 7 lib. 2s. 4d.;" of which " 4 lib." was given to Kirkadie, 
' 3 lib." to Carsphairne, and the remainder to Kirkbride.

tenced ; and returned to bis house in peace. We find him after- 
wards employed in endeavouring to heal the differences which 
separated the Presbyterian brethren. 

Land-owners. — The Hon. Colonel and Mrs Macadam Cathcart 
of Craigengillan, who reside at Berbeth, just without the border 
of the parish, possess nearly the whole of the parish. 

Antiquities. — The sites of two castles are pointed out; — one, a 
few hundred yards above the village, which, from a traditionary story 
of its occupant, is still spoken of as Dame Helen's Castle, has been 
a small building. One of the oldest houses in the village, from 
having been built of the materials of the castle, is called the Castle 
House, and on one of its door lintels bore, thirty years ago, the date 
1003. The village seems to have been originally a dependency 
of this castle, — for closely overhanging the village, and between it 
and the castle, is a most complete moat of considerable height; 
one of those primitive courts whence laws were promulgated, and 
where the justice of these days was administered. The land be- 
tween the castle and the moat still bears the name of the Castle 
Crofts, and at a little distance from thence is the Gillies Knoioe. 

The other castle has been a more considerable structure, and 
must have been from its situation, literally a place of strength, — 
and security also. The site of it is a projecting point on a deep 
glen side, quite precipitous, or rather overhanging, on three sides ; 
the fourth side has had the usual protection of a fosse. From 
some traditionary connection with the history of Alpine, the 68th 
King of the Scots, it is called Leight, or Laght Alpine. 

In Chalmers's Caledonia, notice is taken of a Roman road which 
passed through the length of this parish from south-east to north- 
west. The line of it has been traced through Dumfries and 
Kirkcudbright shires. The last remains of it in this parish, on 
the farm of Burnhead, were raised seven years ago to repair some 
dikes, which had formerly been built of the whinstone of which 
the road was formed. It had been from ten to eleven feet broad, 
composed of a row of large stones on either side, and filled up with 
smaller between. Leaving Dalmellington it entered Dalrymple, 
where it has been traced in various places, and terminated at a 
ford in the River Ayr, not a great distance above the town. We 
have farther evidence that this was a great thoroughfare of the 
Romans, in the correctness with which the course of the Doon 
the only river in Ayrshire, there laid down, is traced in Ptolemy's 
Geography of Britain. There is a strong probability that Dal-

mellingtoii was a Roman station ; the Corda which Dr Henry sets 
down upon the Ayr at Cumnock. The Gaelic etymology of the 
name agrees also entirely with the appearance of the place, cor- 
responding to the first portion of its modern appellation. 

There have been three considerable cairns- or heaps of loose 
stones in the parish, all above the village. One of these immense 
heaps, about half a mile to the east-south-east, on the top of a little hill, 
measured about 115 yardsin circumference. The materials of it were, 
a few years ago, applied by the present occupant of the land to the 
more useful purpose of building dikes. There were found under 
it several graves covered with flat stones, and containing dry hu- 
man bones. Sometime before, another about a mile from it, in a 
valley, was applied to the same purpose. Under it also were found 
graves and bones. Some remains of a third, called the White Cairn 
of Carnannock, have been left in the middle of the moor, about 
half a mile from the head of the parish, and as far to the south- 
west of the Galloway road. It is said to mark the spot where the 
chiefs of one party were buried, after some severe conflict of ancient 
days ; and tradition farther says the slain of the opposite party were 
buried under a similar cairn, some miles farther on, in the farm of 
Holm, in the parish of Carsphairn.

that belong to their everlasting peace, and who fear God, " speaking 
often one to another," Such a cause cannot but operate, to some 
extent at least, for good. Accordingly the attendance on religious 
ordinances is for the most part regular and decent. There is much 
propriety of conduct, and a growing disposition to discountenance 
the profligate and unprincipled. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — 

Number of acres cultivated or occasionally in tillage, - 1,304 

that never have been cultivated, - - 17,896 

that might profitably be cultivated, - 1,150 

in a state of undivided common, - - 277 

under wood, about - - -  750 

The plantations are chiefly larch and Scotch fir, which appear 
to suit the climate well. There are a few ashes birches, and 
saughs, indigenous. So far, the plantations seem to be under good 
management. 

Rent. — The rent of arable land cannot be correctly given. The 
arable land is but a small portion of the parish, and is chiefly made 
up of a few fields in the lower and more sheltered parts of the va- 
rious stock-farms, — but if let together, it might be worth 15s. per 
acre. The average rent of grazing is L. 3 per full-grown cow, and 
3s. per ewe or full-grown sheep. 

Prices. — A one-horse box-cart and wheels, with iron axle, is 
bought for from L. 8 to L. 9 ; a cart and plough harness, L. 3 to 
L. 4 per set; an iron plough from L. 3, 10s. to L. 4, 10s ; a wood 
plough, L. 2 ; harrows mounted from L. 1, 10s. to L. 2 per pair. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of sheep is the black-faced. A 
few Cheviot and Leicester have lately been introduced. The cows 
are Ayrshire. These form the chief stock of the parish, with some 
Galloway and Highland stots and heifers. The management of them 
is well understood. Of late years a considerable deal more land 
has been brought under cultivation than formerly, for the im- 
provement of the pasture. Lime is abundant, and near at hand, 
which enables this system to be pursued profitably ; and with it 
has considerably increased the amount of dairy stock. One en- 
terprising tenant  Captain Walker in Bellsbank has in this way 
improved, or has in process of improvement, 400 acres, and lately 
furrow-drained about forty acres" Encroachments have also been 
made upon the moss-land successfully, by spade husbandry, be- 
ginning with potatoes in lazy beds. 

The general duration of leases of late has been seven years.

AYRSHIRE. 



The practice of landlords, and the voice of the tenantry seem to 
be at variance on the subject of the effects of such a system. I 
shall not attempt to decide the point, though I may be allowed to 
remark, that the tenants who have shewn the greatest enterprise 
in improvement, and expended most liberally, have their farms on 
leases of nineteen years. 

The enclosures are, in general, in good condition and abundant. 
The farm-steadings in some cases are not remarkable for comfort, 
though in this respect considerable improvement has been made of 
late years. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised in 
the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, — 

Grain, almost wholly oats, 1100 quarters at L. 1, Is., - L. 1135 



Green crop, chiefly potatoes, 81 acres at L. 8, - - 648 

Hay, chiefly meadow, - 1800 

Sheep, 8000 pastured, 4s. each, - - - 1600 

Cows, 270 at L. 4, 10s., ... - 1213 

Heifei-s, &amp;c., 440 at L. 2, - - - - 880 

Coals, ... - - 1441 



L. 8739 

Manufactures. — The chief manufactures of the village are wool- 
spinning, and the weaving of plaiding, tartan, and carpets. There 
are two small woollen mills, employing together about thirty hands. 
The yarn spun in the largest was wont to be disposed of wholly 
to the Kilmarnock carpet-manufacturers ; but four years ago, the 
proprietor of the mill added to it also a carpet manufactory, where 
he has now eight looms constantly at work. The yarn spun in 
the other mill is also manufactured on the spot, into blankets, 
plaids, and packing-cloth, &amp;c. There are about forty weavers, 
besides, in the village, the greater number of whom are occupied 
with tartans ; a few weave cotton cloth, and a few are customer 
weavers, i. e. weavers of home-spun yarn. There was wont to 
be a bleachfield of some extent on the farm of Dounieston, at the 
foot of the parish, — the increased importations of Irish linen, and 
the extensive substitution of cotton goods for home manufacture, 
gradually lessened its employment, and for two years it has been 
given up. The premises were last year converted into a thread- 
mill, which has been for some time in active operation. 

Those in the mills work ten hours a-day : the weavers' days 
and hours are regulated entirely by their inclination or their ne- 
cessities; but, being industrious, I apprehend their six days may 
average twelve hours each. At this rate of labour their earnings 
may average Is. 6d. per day. 



DALMELLINGTON.

Nothing injurious to health or morals can be charged against 
the employments of those engaged in manufactures. The purity 
of the atmosphere effectually neutralizes any bad effects of the 
sedentary habits of the weaver upon his health ; and the mills are 
not of such extent, as, by the numbers they congregate, to seduce 
the minds of the young from the simplicity of rural life. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Toions. — The market-town the easiest of access, though 
not the nearest, is Ayr. The distance to it is fifteen miles and a quar- 
ter. The only village in the parish is that which bears its name. It 
is a penny-post to Ayr, from which a foot-post comes on Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday, and returns on the alternate days.. 

There are two turnpike roads in the parish, — the Ayr and Dum- 
fries road, which passes through the extreme length, — and another 
which crosses it at the village. 

Means of Communication. — The means of communication enjoy- 
ed by the parish are abundant. We have the benefit of the Ayr and 
Dumfries coach going one way or the other, each day ; another 
conveyance to and from Ayr on market days, with carriers also on 
the same days, and weekly carriers to Glasgow, Dumfries, and Cas- 
tle Douglas. The bridges are abundant, and chiefly in good repair. 
There are six over the Doon, and nearly double that number over 
the smaller streams, sufficiently large to admit a heavy flood. It was 
not, however, always so. One bridge over the Doon is one hundred 
and sixteen years old, another over the Muck is about sixty ; and 
I believe the first roads in the parish are of nearly as recent a date. 
The fences are chiefly dry stone walls, abundant and in good condi- 
tion. The hedges around the village are thriving and neatly kept. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is as conveniently situated 
as it could be, to suit the population. It is in the village, and 
about five miles from each extremity of the parish. It was built 
in 1766, but, though of no great age, from the dampness of the 
site, it is exceedingly uncomfortable ; and, for both comfort and ac- 
commodation, it is ripe for rebuilding. It is seated for 442, from 
which there have to be deducted 36 sittings, the private property 
of, and occupied by, an heritor in a neighbouring parish, leaving 
for the parish 406 sittings, of which 47 are free. 

The manse was built in J 798. It underwent a thorough re- 
pair in 1833, and an addition is at present being built to it. The 
glebe measures about 10 acres; and is worth L. 2 per acre. The 
stipend is L. 112, Os. 8d. including L. 8. 6s. 8d. for communion

elements; fifty merks Scots besides are paid to the College of Glas 
gow. All attend the parish church, whether churchntien or Dis- 
senters except seven Reformed Presbyterians, about as many more 
■who care for neither sanctuary nor Sabbath, and a family or two 

of Irish Papists. 

There are but eleven individuals Dissenters in the parish, be- 
sides the Papists. The attendance at church is very regular. 

The number of communicants at the Established Church is 
465. The contributions for religious and charitable purposes 
are made by collections in the church, and average about L. 8 
yearly. 

Education— There are four schools in the parish,— one paro- 
chial, one partially endowed, and two others, one of them a female 
school, unendowed. 

The branches taught in three of the schools are English 
and English grammar, writing, arithmetic, mathematics, book- 
keeping, Latin and Greek. The parochial teacher has the legal 
accommodation and the maximum salary. The endowment of the 
second school consists of school and dwelling-house, with garden, 
coals, and L. 10 of salary, given by the Honourable Colonel Mac- 
adam' Cathcart, during his pleasure. Peculiar circumstances pre- 
vent at present any estimate of the amount of fees. The girls in 
the female school are taught English, writing, and needle-work. 

The children are sent to school early, and are usually kept at it 
as long as the circumstances of their parents will admit. Except 
in one° direction, there are but two or three families beyond two 
miles and a-half from the village, and there none are beyond the 
same distance from a school in the village of Patna, in Straiton 

parish. . -it 

Librari/.Theve is a subscription library m the parish. It was 
established in 1823, and now contains upwards of 800 volumes. 
It is indebted to Colonel Cathcart and others for some handsome 
donations of books, but is chiefly supported by its own funds. There 
are at present about 60 subscribers 5 the annual subscription is 4s. 

There is a reading-room, for the establishing and support of 
which property and money to a considerable amount, besides a li- 
brary of 600 volumes, were left by a shopkeeper m the village, 
who died a few years ago. Any surplus yearly income to be ap- 
plied for the education of poor children. 

Savings Bank.- A savings bank was established in the parish 
in May 1834. The amount of deposits remaining at the end ot 



DALMELLINGTON. 321 

last year was between L. 200 and L. 300. The deposits have stea- 
dily increased from the beginning, and from the classes of persons 
who, it is desirable, should take the benefit of the institution. They 
are chiefly young workmen and servants. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of persons receiving 
regular aid is 14. They receive on an average 5s. Id. per calen- 
dar month. Several others receive occasional relief. The annual 
expense amounts to about L. 70, of which about L. 30 is made up 
of collections at the church doors, and the small addition of a part 
of the dues of proclamation. The balance of the expenditure is 
liberally supplied by Colonel Cathcart. I am sorry to have to tes- 
tify the lowering of the ancient spirit of independence in many, with 
reference to receiving parish relief. I remark it, not so much in 
the poor themselves, as in their relations, who are anxious to be rid 
of the burden of them, by " flinging them on the session." The 
olden spirit is not, however, wholly banished ; there are yet some 
specimens of the honest and commendable independence of spirit, 
which will rather doubly toil, if any degree of possible exertion 
can eke out a scanty pittance. 

Fairs.— Theve were wont to be monthly cattle markets and 
fairs held here, but new arrangements among the cattle-dealers 
have abolished the market, and reduced the fairs to three, which 
are held on Pastern's E'en, the first Friday after Whitsunday, and 
Hallow E'en, all old style. The chief business transacted at them 
is concerning wool, and feeing servants. 

Inns, §-c. — There are 8 inns and public houses in the parish,— 
seven of these in the village, supported to a considerable extent by 
the visitants, during the fishing-season, to Loch Doon. But even 
for the accommodation of these parties, or for profit to the inn- 
keepers themselves, or advantage to the community, they are too 
many by a half. 

Fuel. — Fuel is in great abundance, and very cheap. Very few 
peats are used. One of the coal pits at present worked is but 
about a mile from the village, and there they are had for about 3s. 
per ton of 20 cwt. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Those who saw the parish, forty years ago, speak of the great 
improvement in its cultivation. It was then the practice to turn 
up any patch that might be conceived capable of yielding a scanty 
crop for a year, without any assistance of lime or manure, and 
it was left to return to its native wildness again. Draining was 



322 



AYRSHlllE. 



scarce even thought of. No attempt was made to rear artifi- 
cial grasses ; it was conceived they would not grow. Only within 
these thirty years or so, has lime been applied to the soil, and 
grasses sown. A complete contrast in the facilities of communi- 
cation is also spoken of. The roads were rough" and rudely formed, 
literally " over the mountain and over the moor." The streams 
were without bridges ; and a winter torrent could, in half an hour, 
fix the inhabitants of a district within their proper boundaries. The 
industry of the parish has had its rise and fall since the publication 
of the former Report. The woollen manufactory then projected was 
established, and gave a new impetus to, and enlarged the extent of, 
the staple business, — plaiding and tartan manufacturing. But the 
English blanketing and cotton cloths have lessened the demand 
for plaidings, and the Bannockburn manufacturers have got nearer 
the market for tartans. The chief improvements in agriculture 
of which the land seems capable would be- the extension of furrow- 
draining, — much of the soil being wet, and upon a retentive sub- 
soil ;— and the following out of the system so successfully pursued, 
of liming the land capable of cultivation, cropping it for two years, 
and sowing it down for permanent pasture. The extension of plan- 
tations in clumps and stripes for shelter would farther contribute 
much to benefit both stock and crop, and to ornament the appear- 
ance of the country.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JAMES CHRYSTAL, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Auchinlbck is said to be derived from two Celtic words 

signifying " the field of the flag-stones." Whatever may be 
the origin of the name, there is certainly a great abundance of 
freestone in the parish, though not altogether of that description 
implied in the name. 

Extent and Boundaries.— The form of the parish is exceedingly 
inconvenient, being about 16 miles from east to west, and not more 



AUCHINLECK. 



323 



than 2 miles on an average in breadth. It contains about 19,000 
acres. It is bounded on the north by the parishes of Mauchhne, 
Sorn, and Muirkirk ; on the east by Muirkirk and Crawfordjohn ; 
on the south by Kirkconnel, New Cumnock, and Old Cumnock ; 
and on the west by Ochiltree. 

Topographical Apjjearances. — There is nothing very remarkable 
in the appearance of the parish. It is on the whole a cold and 
bleak district, particularly towards the east, and, lying in a high and 
exposed situation, is by no means distinguished for its fertility. 
Airds Moss occupies the centre of it for about four miles on its 
eastern boundary,— which tends to give it an aspect of barrenness in 
that direction ; but further to the south, and especially on the banks 
of one or two streams which traverse the country, there are a 
number of farms which produce fair crops of oats, and in some few 
cases also of turnips. The more westerly part of the parish is al- 
most wholly cultivated, and has a greater appearance of fertility, 
from being better clothed with wood, and from the farms being 
more numerous and better enclosed. The soil, however, here is 
generally composed of a cold, stiiF clay, which requires constant 
liming or manuring to produce a tolerable crop, and which is very 
apt to sour, from the frequent rains which fall upon it, and lie up- 
on its surface. The holm lands are very productive. Glenmore 
is a wild valley of 5 or 6 miles in extent. 

Meteorology and Hydrography. — In common with the rest of 
the parishes which lie so near the western coast, this parish is much 
visited by rain, and the prevalence of the south-west wind makes 
the climate damp. From the peculiar direction, however, in which 
the ranges of the hills run, it perhaps, on the whole, enjoys drier 
weather than some of the neighbouring parishes. 

The principal streams connected with the district are the rivers 
Ayr and Lugar. They are nearly similar in size, and ultimately 
unite about a mile below the extremity of the parish. The for- 
mer, after flowing through a great part of the parish of Muirkirk, 
forms the boundary between it and Auchinleck for a short distance, 
and then enters the parish of Sorn. The Lugar is formed by the 
junction of two smaller streams, and forms the boundary between 
Cumnock and Auchinleck for 5 miles, and between Auchinleck and 
Ochiltree for about 2 miles. 

Geology. — There is a great variety of minerals. Sandstone is 
abundant, and of different qualities. Lime has long been wrought 
as well as coal, and tliere is an extensive field of ironstone toward 



324 



AYIISHIIIE. 



Muirkii k. A small bed of iron ore is found on the farm of Bog- 
head, and at Gasswater there is an excellent description of fire 
clay. A course of mineral water runs through the same farm of 
Boghead, and that of Waltrees, which petrifies moss, and there is 
another of a similar kind at Cubbs Craigs, which is said to have 
produced masses upwards of a ton weight. 

Soil. — The soil is various. In the lower part of the parish, it is 
generally of a stiff clay with a cold impenetrable bottom. In wet 
weather, therefore, while it retains too much moisture, in drier 
seasons its natural tendency is tobecome very hard. The great point 
in this soil is to get quit of the surface water. In other parts, the 
soil is lighter and warmer, and not unfrequently it has been re- 
claimed from the surrounding moss. 

Woods. — Though the general character of the parish may be 
bleakness, it is by no means universally so. There are consider- 
able plantations in several parts of it, and more particularly in the 
neighbourhood of the House at Auchinleck, where there is not 
only a great extent of younger wood, but many trees of great age 
and size. There is also a quantity of wood in the parks around 
Dumfries House, which, though itself in Cumnock parish, has a 
part of its demesne in Auchinleck. 

II. — Civil History. 
EminentMen, SfC. — This parishhas acquired celebrity from being 
the residence of James Boswell, Esq. author of the " Life of John- 
son." Johnson accompanied his friend to Auchinleck on his re- 
turn from the " Journey in the Hebrides and it appears from 
one of his published letters that he had intended to write a history 
of the Auchinleck family. Several of the members of this family 
have been distinguished men. The following is the account of 
their connection with Ayrshire, as it is given in the Life of John- 
son : — " In the year 1504, the barony or manor of Auchinleck, 
in Ayrshire, which belonged to a family of the same name with 
the lands, having fallen to the Crown by forfeiture, James the 
Fourth, King of Scotland, granted it to Thomas Boswell, a branch 
of an ancient family in the county of Fife, styling him in the char- 
ter, « dilecto familiari nostro,' and assigning as the cause of the 
grant, « pro bono et fideli servitio nobis prestito.' Thomas Bos- 
well was slain in battle, fighting along with his sovereign at the 
fatal field of Flodden." The Laird of Auchinleck who was pro- 
bably one of the Auchinlecks of that Ilk accompanied Sir Wil- 
liam Wallace to Glasgow, along with Wallace of Richardtown 



AUCHINLECK. 



325 



and James Cleland, when Sir William slew Earl Percy, and put 
the English to rout. William Murdoch, of the house of Bolton 
and Watt, to whom the country is so much indebted for his useful 
application of gas, was a native of this parish. Mr M' Gavin, 
the author of the Protestant, was likewise born in it. Wallace of 
Wallacetoun was once a family of considerable importance in this 
district, but they now are unconnected with it by property. 

Land-owners. — The principal land-owners are, Sir James Bos- 
well, Bart., who possesses nearly two-thirds of the valued rental ; 
the Marquess of Bute ; and Mr Limond of Dalblair ; besides whom 
there are eight other proprietors. 

Parochial Registers. — Previous to the appointment of the pre- 
sent schoolmaster, these were not very regularly kept ; and they 
go no farther back than to about the beginning of last century. 

Antiquities. — There is an old castle at Auchinleck, which is 
very much dilapidated, but which, from its situation, must have 
been a place of great strength. The date of its erection is un- 
known ; there are, however, several legends regarding its history : 
Near it, is the old House or Place of Auchinleck. Here, and 
indeed both up and down the stream, in the neighbourhood of 
which it stands, the scenery is remarkably fine, — the rocks on its 
banks being in many places about 100 feet in height, and the 
whole finely shrouded in wood. There are two or three bridges 
connecting various parts of the grounds ; and one in particular is 
very grand, being built across a deep ravine, and commanding a 
beautiful view of the picturesque rivulet which runs below. The 
present house stands on a more elevated situation, at a consider- 
able distance from the old one, and is a handsome Grecian struc- 
ture built by Lord Auchinleck. There is another old castle in 
the upper part of the parish, called Kyle Castle, the property of 
the Marquess of Bute. Very little of it remains ; and there seems 
to be no trace whatever of its history. It is situate in a seques- 
tered district, on an elevated tongue of land, near the junction of 
the Gelt and Glenmore waters. At Dornal, also, there are some 
few remains of what seems at one period to have been a place of 
strength. 

Near the head' of Airds Moss, is to be seen the monument erect- 
ed to the memory of Richard Cameron, who was here overtaken 
and slain by the dragoons, on the 20th of July 1680. It consist- 
ed till lately of a flat stone with his own name, and the names of 
the otlier individuals who were slain along with him, inscribed up- 



326 



AYllSIilllE. 



on it. A more conspicuous memorial of his life and death was 
reared some years ago from the proceeds of a collection made at 
a sermon delivered near the spot. The names of the individuals 
who were slain along with Richard Cameron are, Michael Came- 
ron, John Gammel, John Hamilton, James Gray, Robert Dick, 
Captain John Fowler, Thomas Watson, and Robert Paterson. 

Not far from the confines of this parish and Muirkirk, on the 
banks of the Ayr, are the remains of an old iron-work, said in the 
former Statistical Account to have been erected by Lord Cathcart. 
Little is known of its history ; but it is said that the workmen em- 
ployed in it were English ; that they used the iron ore from the 
farm of Whitock, on the opposite side of the Ayr,— the property at 
present of the Honourable Mrs Macadam Cathcart,— the propor- 
tion of iron in which is as high as 80 p cent. ; and that, as there 
is no coal in the immediate neighbourhood, they made use of 
charred peat as a substitute. 

On the lands of Wallacetown, near the confluence of the Bellow 
and Glenmore waters, is to be seen what was thirty years ago a 
" rocking-stone ;" it is of some tons weight, and rests on two other 
stones placed upright ; but it is no longer moveable, its equili- 
brium having been destroyed. Its situation is such, that it may na- 
turally be supposed to have been at one time connected with a 
Druidical grove. 

HL — PoPULAtlON. 

There has been a considerable increase in the population for a 
number of years: In 1791 it was 775, in 1831, 1662. If we class 
the population employed at the two collieries of Birnieknowe and 
Common, and that part of Auchinleck adjoining Cumnock along 
with the village, it will amount to fully one-half of the whole, the 
rest of the inhabitants being scattered throughout the parish ge- 
nerally. 

As all do not get the births of their children registered, and as 
they are baptized by ministers of different denominations, no ac- 
curate statement can be given of the yearly average amount of 
these. It will probably be about 36. The yearly average num- 
ber of burials is 29 ; and of marriages 13.

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — In this parish, farming is carried on agreeably to 
the improved methods now so generally prevalent. From the state 
of the soil, however, the crops are not so varied or abundant as 
they would otherwise probably be, and the farmers in most cases 
want means to engage in improvements to any great extent. There 
is very little wheat sown ; barley and bear are more common, but 
oats is the general crop. Of late, beans have been frequently cul- 
tivated, but are a very precarious crop. Potatoes, of course, are 
abundant, but a field of turnips is more rarely to be met with. 
Such, with the addition of rye-grass and meadow hay which grows 
in luxuriance in some of the natural wet pastures, is the common 
agricultural produce of the parish. 

The following view of the state of the cultivation of the parish \s 
as near the truth as can be ascertained. 

The number of acres cultivated, including meadow land is, 5040 
never cultivated, . . 13590 

under wood, natural or planted, - 370 

There can, however, be no doubt that a great addition mighi 
be made to the arable land, with a profitable application of capital. 
Several hundred acres which were formerly moss or waste land 
have of late years been brought into cultivation. 

Rent. — The average rent of arable land will probably be 17s. 
per acre. The average rent of grazing is at the rate of L. 3 per 
ox or cow grazed, and at the rate of 5s. per ewe or full-grown 
sheep pastured for the year. The kind of sheep usually met with 
in this district are the black-faced. The cattle generally are of 
the Ayrshire breed. 

A little has been done in the way of furrow-draining, but to no 
great extent, — in some cases with the tile, and in others with small 
broken stones. 

Leases. — The leases in the majority of instances are granted for 
nine years only, though in some they extend to a period of four- 
teen and nineteen years. The farmers depend fully more upon 
their dairy than on the crops which their fields produce. Indeed, 
they are often bound not to plough above a fourth of their land 
yearly, and consequently the greater part of it is in pasture. They 
generally, therefore, keep large stocks of milch cows. They also 
rear a considerable number of young cows. The milk is almost uni- 
versally converted into cheese, and is sold in Glasgow and else- 
where under the name of Dunlop. 

From the number of cows that are kept, dairy-maids are in o reat

demand, who will frequently receive L. 5 or even more in the half 
year, but then they will perhaps have the milking of twelve or fifteen 
cows, and the charge of making the cheese likewise. Colliers can 
earn 4s. a day. 

Quarries and Mines. — As before-mentioned, there is a great 
variety of stone. In the neighbourhood of the village, it is gene- 
rally a red sandstone. There is a quarry of freestone upon the 
banks of the Lugar, which is in great demand for mill-stones. 
There is a stone at Wallacetown said to be fire proof, and used 
for building ovens. There are two considerable quarries of lime- 
stone ; the principal of these, upon the Auchinleck property, an- 
nually yields about 50,000 bushels, or 5000 carts of shells, and 
is considered to be peculiarly adapted for land ; the other, the 
property of Mr Limond of Dalblair, about 20,000 bushels. They 
are situate about five miles above the more populous part of the pa- 
rish. There is an inferior species of coal found close beside them 
with which the lime is burned. The limestone itself is very near 
the surface of the ground, and varies from six to fourteen feet in 
thickness. It is chiefly used for agricultural purposes. When 
the land has just been reclaimed, from twenty-five to thirty carts 
of lime are frequently put upon the acre ; when it has been long- 
er in cultivation, perhaps not above twenty. Limestone is also 
found on the farms of Boghead and Tarreoch, and at Dornal. 

The coal has already been alluded to. It has been wrought 
from time immemorial on the Auchinleck estate ; and pits have 
more recently been opened on the lands of Mr Alexander of Bal- 
lochmyle. Both works have steam-engines connected with them. 
Only two seams fitted for use have as yet been discovered, and 
these vary from a yard to 4 feet in thickness. The pits are about 
30 fathoms in depth. About 20 or 24 men are usually employed 
in them ; and they annually put out about 8456 tons. The sale 
is not confined to this parish, but several of the neighbouring pa- 
rishes are more or less supplied with coal from these pits. The 
price of coal at the pit is not generally more than 5s, or 5s. 6d. 
per ton. 

Produce. — The following is the gross amount of raw produce 
raised annually in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained :

Manufactures. — Weaving by the hand-loom has long been car- 
ried on. The webs are chiefly supplied from Glasgow, and the 
most common fabrics are light silks and muslins. The number of 
weavers probably varies from 60 to 70 ; the wages of those em- 
ployed in the manufacture of silks are from 10s. to ISs., and of 
the others, from 7s. 6d. to 8s. weekly. 

A number of women, both older and younger, throughout the 
parish, are engaged in flowering muslin. This is not confined to 
those residing in the village, but many of the farmers' daughters 
and others find it a profitable employment. The cloth is sent out 
by Glasgow houses, to their several agents in the country, who 
take the charge of getting it flowered and returning it. The whole 
of the work is done by the needle, and is therefore very tedious, 
but so expert have those occupied in it become, that Ayrshire work 
is considered superior, and brings a higher price in the market. 
The wages earned in this way are from 3s. to 8s. weekly, and 
sometimes even considerably more. 

Box-making is likewise a common employment. This species of 
work was originally confined to Laurencekirk. From thence it 
reached Cumnock, through the ingenuity of an individual connect- 
ed with that parish, who, having been employed by a gentleman, 
who was visiting in the neighbourhood, to mend a Laurencekirk 
box, gained so much insight into the nature of the work, that from 
imitating, he soon began to rival its inventors. The nearness of 
Auchinleck to Cumnock accounts for its introduction into this 
parish. The most considerable manufacture of this kind is at 
Mauchline. Those engaged in this business do not confine them- 
selves to the manufacture of snuff-boxes ; but cases for calling- 
cards and needles, and ornamental boxes of various descriptions are 
occasionally made. The wood used is plane-tree. When the box 
is made, it is generally painted and varnished. Indeed, a great 
many coats of varnish are necessary to preserve the painting. 
Many of these paintings are transferred from prints, others are re- 
gularly done with the brush ; but, the most common device at pre- 
sent in vogue is an imitation of tartan, and other checks, which is 
done by a small machine. There is, however, a variety of ways of 
finishing them. The quality of the Cumnock boxes, it is said, is 
fully equal to that of those made at Laurencekirk, though they are

AYRSHIRE. 



sold at a greatly inferior price. Their value has fallen very much 
in the market from what it once was. The number of individuals 
employed in this trade is 64 ; the average wages earned by them 
are 13s. 6d. per week, and the quantity of boxes finished weekly is 
58 dozen. The greater part of these are sent to London. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — The nearest market-town is Kilmarnock, which 
is fourteen miles distant ; Ayr is fifteen ; Galston twelve ; and Cum- 
nock one and a-half miles distant. The village of Auchinleck, which 
is feued from the estate of Auchinleck, chiefly consists of a row of 
houses on each side of the Glasgow and Dumfries road, and may 
probably contain about 600 inhabitants. The Independent coach 
from Glasgow to Carlisle passes through it daily. This road is kept 
in good repair, but is in many places remarkably hilly. The road 
from Ayr to Edinburgh by Cumnock, also traverses this parish for 
about five miles, and that to Ayr by Ochiltree for about three miles. 
The road to Glasgow, by Galston, branches off from the Carlisle 
road at the Auchinleck toll-bar. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church is situate very conveniently 
for the greater part of the population ; but, from the extent of the 
parish, is inconveniently situate for a considerable number. It is 
distant- about three miles from the lower, and about thirteen or 
fourteen from the upper, extremity of the parish. Many of the in- 
habitants of this quarter, in coming to their own church, pass the 
church of Cumnock. In Chalmers's Caledonia, there is the follow- 
ing statement in regard to Auchinleck Church : " In 1238, the se- 
cond Walter of the Stewart family granted to the monks of Pais- 
ley, in pure alms, the Church of Auchinleck, with all its pertinents. 
The Church of Auchinleck continued to belong to the monks of 
Paisley till the Reformation. The monks enjoyed the tithes and 
revenues, and provided a chaplain to serve the cure." It is not 
known when the present church was built, with the exception of 
the aisle, which was added by Lord Auchinleck in 1754. Part of 
the older fabric is believed to be of a date prior to the Reformation. 
It is said, indeed, that it is statedly anathematized by the Pope as 
being one of the first churches in this country in which the doc- 
trines of the Reformation were taught. It is not easy to discover 
the authority on which this has been affirmed, though it is quite 
a common report in the country. It can accommodate about 400 
persons. The sittings are generally, according to custom, divided 
among the proprietors, and occupied by their tenants. The table

seats, however, are free, but several of the seats in the galleries 
have been let to the villagers at a very cheap rate, and the sum 
derived from this source goes into the poor's fund, and does not 
amount to above L. 4, 10s. annually. This is chiefly done with 
the view of giving individuals a right to certain sittings. Under- 
neath the church, is the burying-place of the Auchinleck family. 
It is hewn out of the rock. A new church, which contains up- 
wards of 800 sittings, is so far advanced as to be roofed in ; it is 
quite adjacent to the old one. Sir James Boswell is patron. 

The manse was built in the year 1756, and an addition made 
to it in 1796. A considerable repair was also made upon it, about 
seventeen years ago. Being a single house, it has not so much ac- 
commodation as its appearance seems to indicate. It is, however, 
substantially built, and on the whole very comfortable. The situa- 
tion of it is beautiful, being close upon the demesne around Dum- 
fries House, and commanding from the back a view of the house 
itself, and of a great part of the grounds and the circumjacent 
country. The extent of the glebe is about six acres ; it is all 
arable, but probably would not let at a rate higher than L. 1, 15s. 
per acre. The stipend is ] 09 bolls meal, 25 bolls, 3 firlots, 3 lip- 
pies bear, L. 44, 13s. lOjd. money. 

There is a chapel connected with the Associate Synod of Ori- 
ginal Seceders, or Antiburghers, as they are usually called, in the 
village. It has been vacant for upwards of three years. The con- 
gregation, in addition to a house, offer L. 70 a-year to a minister. 
The number of individuals in the parish connected with the 
United Secession, and whose meeting-house is in Cumnock, is 
about 235 ; the number of Antiburghers is about 86. Besides 
these, there are three or four individuals who profess to be Inde- 
pendents, and one or two who are generally beheved to be Roman 
Catholics, though they in reality make no public profession of re- 
ligion whatever. The rest of the parish, with the exception of two 
or three famiUes, who go nowhere, nominally belong to the church. 

Divine service is generally well attended in the Established 
Church, particularly during the summer. From the extent of 
the parish, it is not so crowded in winter. It would, however, 
be much better attended, both in summer and winter, were there 
more accommodation, — many complaining that they have no seats. 
The'new church will remedy this defect. The number of mem- 
bers connected with the Antiburgher chapel, and who are gather- 



332 



AYRSHIllE. 



ed from the different parishes around, is stated to be about 100. 
The number of communicants in the Estabhshed Church is 417. 

Education. — The parish school and school-house are well situ- 
ate, being close by the village. They are both in tolerable order. 
The master's salary is the maximum, viz. L. 34, 4s. 4d. There 
are no Latin scholars at present. Besides the parish school, there 
is a private one in the village very numerously attended. Another 
is usually kept, about three miles distant from the church, towards 
the lower part of the parish. One is also highly requisite in the 
upper part of it, where a teacher is generally kept by the various 
farmers and others connected with the district. As yet, however, 
they have no proper school-house, though it is very much wanted. 
It rarely happens that an individual brought up in the parish can- 
not both read and write. 

Library. — There is a valuable and extensive library at Auchin- 
leck House. 

Savings Bank. — At Cumnock, there is a Savings bank managed 
by the parochial teacher. Those inhabitants of Auchinleck who 
feel disposed to avail themselves of it, are permitted to do so, 
though few take advantage of it. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 24, and the average sum allotted to each 
per week is Is. Id., or L. 2, 16s. 4d. per year. The annual sum 
required for the support of the poor is L. 72, 10s. Of this sum, 
there is derived from a voluntary assessment on the part of the 
heritors, L. 45 ; from church collections, L. 19 ; from seat rents, 
L. 4, 10s.; from interest on a mortification of L. 100, L. 2, 10s.; 
from mortcloth, L. 1, 10s. There is no disposition on the part 
of the poor to refrain from seeking parochial relief, nor do they 
seem to consider it degrading to receive it. 

Fairs. — The only fair of any consequence held in the parish is 
the Lamb Fair, which takes place on the last Tuesday of August 
annually, and, being the latest held in the country, is generally 
much frequented. 

Inns and Ale-houses. — The number of these is six, and they are 
all in the village. 

Fuel. — As before-mentioned, there i abundance of coal in 
this parish. In the upper part of it, a considerable quantity of peat 
is used for fuel, of which also there is no scarcity.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ROBERT PATON, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of the parish, in charters of the thirteenth 
century, is written Strattin and Stratoun.  A pair of commu- 
nion cups, which are believed to have been presented to the parish 
in the reign of Charles IL, have an inscription " for the Kirk of 
Stratin." Since the Revolution, the name has been written Strai- 
ten. It has been, in all probability, derived, as Chalmers suggests, 
from the Gaelic strath, a valley. The whole of the district was 
inhabited by a Celtic race, and the village stands upon the Girvan, 
at the entrance of a pleasant and fertile valley. 

Extent, Boundaries, Sfc. — Straiten is one of the largest parishes 
in Ayrshire. Its extreme length, from Carnochan on the river 
Doon, to the farm of Star, at the head of Loch Doon, is more than 
20 miles. Its extreme breadth from the Doon near Dalmelling- 
ton, to the farm of Knockgarner, is upwards of 6 miles. The 
number of square miles may be about 82. It is bounded on the 
north, by Kirkmichael and Dalrymple parishes ; on the east, by 
Dalmellington ; on the south, by Carsphairn, Kells, Minigalf, and 
Barr ; and on the west, by Dailly and Kirkmichael. Straiten vil- 
lage is distant from Ayr 14; miles, from Maybole 6, from Kirk- 
michael 4, and from Dalmellington 6|. On the Galloway road 
there is neither town nor village nearer than Newton- Stewart, at 
a distance of 30 miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — In a parish of such extent, there 
cannot but be great variety of scenery. The valleys of the Gir- 
van and Doon are arable, and are either cultivated or in meadow, 
so that they present many agreeable landscapes. Tlie rest of the 
parish is hilly, and the south-east extremity is remarkably wild and 
rocky. Craigengower, or the hill of the goats, rises immediate-

ly behind the manse, to the height of 1300 feet. Benn;in liill, half 
a mile south of the village, on which a small obelisk was built about 
fifty years ago, is about 1150 feet high. From both these hills, 
there are fine views of Ayrshire, the Frith of Clyde, Arran, and 
part of the coast of Ireland. The hills in the liigher part of the 
parish are exceedingly numerous, but do not rise to any great ele- 
vation. 

Meteorology, 8c. — The climate is rather moist, but more mild 
than the vicinity of the hills might lead a stranger to imagine. 
All kinds of fruit-trees grow well upon the banks of the Girvan, 
and in some seasons even peaches come to perfection upon an 
open wall. Fruit-trees have never, however, succeeded on the 
banks of the Doon in this parish. In the higher parts of the parish, 
particularly along Loch Doon, no crop is seen except, adjoining 
the farm-houses, very small patches of rye. 

The parish is very healthy, — the average number of deaths 
for the last ten years being only 1 in 71 of the whole population, 
although many young men in the prime of life are always leaving 
the parish, to settle in the towns of Scotland, or to engage in the 
employment of travelling dealers in England. 

Hydrography. — Next to the multitude of hills, the most strik- 
ing feature is the number of lakes that are either wholly within the 
parish, or upon its borders. Loch Doon belongs to this parish, 
being included in the charters of the Marquis of Ailsa.  This 
loch is upwards of six miles long, and a mile in breadth, and is 
much frequented in summer by fishing parties. The scenery 
around is bleak and rugged. There is no wood upon its banks, 
and the sluices made about fifty years ago, to regulate the egress 
of its waters into the river Doon, have destroyed the bold outlet it 
had, when the stream poured over the natural rocky barrier, and 
laid bare a large extent of gravelly and useless land. There are 
twenty-two other small lakes in the parish. Upon three of them. 
Loch Braden, Dercleugh Loch, and Loch Finlas, boats are kept 
for angling. 

Two rivers rise in the parish. The Doon flows from Loch 
Doon, forms the boundary of the parish for ten miles, and, after 
passing through the parishes of Dalrymple and Maybole, falls into 
the sea two miles from Ayr. Immediately beneath Loch Doon, 
it runs for upwards of a mile through a very bold and narrow chan-

nel. The glen of Berbeth, in which its bed is buried in this part 
of its course, is perhaps the grandest of all the natural objects to 
be seen in Ayrshire, and may vie with any of the most celebrated 
Highland scenes. A walk has been formed along the very brink 
of the river, from which the glen is seen to great advantage, espe- 
cially in autumn after a flood. The river pent up in a channel of 
not more than four or five yards, is chafing and fretting among the 
rocks at your feet, the craigs of Ness rises perpendicularly before 
you on the other side, to the height of 230 feet, and the cliff's on 
both sides are seen clothed with trees of richest foliage, of which 
the branches overhang the river, and often kiss the foaming stream. 
From the glen the Doon flows in great beauty through the 
grounds of Berbeth, and then expands into a loch much frequent- 
ed by water-fowl. From this loch to Patna it runs sluggishly 
for five miles through meadows, without the ornament of a single 
tree. 

The river Girvan has its source above Loch Braden, about twelve 
miles from Straiton, and falls into the sea at Girvan. From Tare- 
law fall, three miles from Straiton, it flows to the village through 
a highly cultivated valley surrounded by hills, which are in some 
parts covered with natural wood, and rise in others in bold preci- 
pitous cliffs. From Straiton it winds for three miles through the 
richly wooded grounds of Blairquhan, and then enters Kirkmichael 
parish. The river Stinchar bounds this parish for a mile or two, 
near its source among the lochs in Barr parish. 

There are two waterfalls in the parish. Dalkairney Linn, which 
is formed by a small stream near Berbeth, is a perpendicular jet of 
forty feet, and is noticed in old books for tourists. Tarelaw Linn 
is upon the Girvan above Straiton. The stream rushes down se- 
veral successive falls, forming together a descent of more than sixty 
feet, and then opens into a deep and wooded dell. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish offers an extensive field 
of study to the geologist. The hills above Loch Doon and the 
island in the loch are granite. Adjoining this formation are grey-  
wacke and greywacke slate. Along the Girvan the rocks are of 
the trap species, interspersed with mountain limestone ; and in the 
lower part of the parish the red sandstone is common. Granite 
in the form of boulders is found scattered over every part of the 
parish. Limestone has been quarried in seven different places, 
of which Threethorns once yielded the largest quantity, though the 



33G

only mines now extensively wrouglit are those of Patna and Keirs, 
Coal has been found in four diflcrent quarters of the parish. Of 
late, Patna is the only colliery that has been wrought to a great 
extent. The mine at Patna runs through 1st, 48 feet of rough 
freestone ; 2d, a bed of coarse sandstone ; 3d, 3 feet smithy coal ; 
4th, 2 feet of slaty stone ; 5th, 12 feet coal ; 6th, 6 feet grey stone ; 
7th, 6 feet coal. The dechvity is 1 foot in 5, and the dip 1 in 
3. The limestone at Keirs abounds with petrified marine shells, 
chiefly bivalve. The soil is very various. On the banks of the 
Girvan it is gravelly and light ; on the borders of the Doon it is 
clayey and retentive. 

Zoology. — The streams abound with trout, and in favourable 
seasons salmon are numerous in the Doon and Girvan. The lakes 
are full of trout and pike. Par are never seen beyond Tarelaw 
fall, another proof to the many which naturalists have, that they 
must have an access to the sea, though it is remarkable that the 
nature of so common a fish should still be a question in science. 
The moors abound with grouse and black game. Roe-deer have 
been seen two or three times lately. Two pair of eagles usually 
have their eyries in the higher part of the parish, and one more 
than seven feet between the extremities of the wings was lately 
shot, on the farm of Star. 

Botany. — To classify the indigenous plants in such an exten- 
sive parish would require a long period of study. The quantity 
of natural wood is a very pleasing feature in the scenery of the 
parish. Sir D. Hunter Blair has planted extensively on his lands ; 
the Honourable Colonel Macadam Cathcart has also large plan- 
tations around Berbeth. The Marquis of Ailsa, with 25,000 acres 
of property, has not more than an acre under wood, if the stand- 
ard trees near the village be excluded. There are some fine old 
trees, chiefly sycamore, around the village and manse. The old 
wood around Blairquhan gives great beauty to the mansion, par- 
ticularly a dark avenue formed by two ranges of lofty lime trees. 
• The most remarkable trees in the parish are the Dool trees of 
Blairquhan, on which the barons, in the olden times, hung the cul- 
prits that were under their jurisdiction. 

n. — Civil History. 

Historical iVoifzces.— Chalmers in his Caledonia gives an ac- 
count of the parish. There is also a slight notice of it in a small 
work of Mr Abercrombie, minister of Maybole, during the preva-

lence of Episcopacy.  These, with the former Statistical Account, 
are the only written documents that give any information regard- 
ing the parish. 

CJiief Land-owners. — The valued rental of the parish is L. 4428,' 
of which the Marquis of Ailsa has rather more than a fourth ; Sir 
D. Hunter Blair, Bart., and the Honourable Colonel Macadam 
Cathcart, have each nearly a fourth. The remainder is the pro- 
perty chiefly of Sir James Fergusson, Bart., and the Honourable 
Mrs Leslie Gumming, the Heirs of Mr Baird of Nether Berbeth 
having a single farm. Sir D. H. Blair is the largest proprietor in 
real rent. 

Antiquities. — The most remarkable object of antiquity in the 
parish is the ruinous castle of Loch Doon, situated on an island 
near the head of Loch Doon. It was in ancient times a royal 
castle under the keeping of the Earls of Cassilis. The whole en- 
closure, formed of eleven irregular sides, is about 230 feet with- 
out the walls. The tower is square. The style of the building, 
which is a mixture of Saxon and Gothic, has been of a superior 
order, and every expedient has been used by battlements, embra- 
sures, and a portcullis to render it secure. There is no tradition 
regarding the time when it was built, that is worthy of attention. 
It was one of the five strongholds which were held by the royal- 
ists during the minority of the Bruce's son, when the rest of Scot- 
land yielded to the English power. Its gallant defender was John 
Thomson, who is believed to be the same that led back the re- 
mains of the Scottish army from Ireland, after the death of Edward 
Bruce. "I The interest of this venerable ruin, which is probably 
more than 600 years old, has of late been greatly increased 
by the discovery on two occasions of canoes in the loch near the 
castle gate. Three were found in the year 1823, and three in the 
year 1831. One of the former is in the Museum of Glasgow Uni- 
versity. The latter are preserved in a pond near Berbeth. All 
of them have been hewn out of single oak trees. The largest is 
23 feet long, 2 feet 6 inches in depth, and 3 feet 9 inches in breadth 
at the stern. In one of them were found an oaken war club, a battle- 
axe, a number of large animal teeth, and a quanity of hazel-nuts. 
These canoes were probably used at the building of the castle. 
Where the oaks grew out, of which they were scooped, is a question 
which it would be difficult to determine. The whole country around

has been desolate for centuries, yet, as one of the titles of the Earls 
of Cassilis is said to have been ranger of the forest of Buchan, they 
may have grown in the vicinity. There are, however, few oaks of 
such magnitude in our age, even in the most cultivated parts of 
Ayrshirer The old Castle of Blairquhan, of which some of the 
windows and mouldings are preserved in the kitchen court of the 
modern mansion, was of great antiquity. A considerable part of 
it had been built about the year 1570, but M'Whirter's tower was 
some centuries older. A curious legendary tale regarding one of 
this family in the reign of James III., may be found in Chambers's 
Picture of Scotland. The castle afterwards became the property 
of the Kennedys, a branch of the family of Cassilis. In the reign 
of Charles II. it came into the possession of the Whiteford family ; 
and at the end of last century it was purchased by the present 
family of Hunter Blair, who are maternally descended from the 
Kennedys, Earls of Cassilis. 

During the persecution, a garrison was stationed in Blairquhan, 
of 100 foot, and 20 horse. Four persons were at that period shot 
in the parish, of whom one Thomas M'Haffie has a tombstone 
erected to his memory in the church-yard, f 

Modern ikfaisfoz5.— Blairquhan Castle, the seat of Sir D. Hun- 
ter Blair, Bart., was finished in the year, 1824. It is upon the 
banks of the Girvan, almost upon the site of the ancient castle, 
and about a mile from Straiten village. It is a correct specimen 
of the architecture of Henry the Seventh's time, and its general 
effect is striking and splendid. The porch is of the Tudor style,

some bridge and lodge, has been conducted up the river for two 
miles and a half, and winds through rocky and well-wooded banks, 
till it comes within sight of the house, at the distance of half a mile, 
and presents a sudden prospect of the mansion, and the hills ot 
Craigengower, and Bennan, in the back ground, peculiarly interest- 
ing and grand. The grounds have been laid out with great judg- 

ment and taste. , , 

Berbeth, the residence of the Honourable Colonel Macadam 
Cathcart, is on the Doon at an extremity of this parish, nine miles-

from Straiten, and three from Dalniellington. The house is a 
plain fabric, but the natural beauties of the grounds are of a pecu- 
liar and very high order. The Marquis of Ailsa has a shooting 
lodge eight miles from Straiton, which stands on the banks of the 
Stinchar, among rugged cliffs and lofty mountains. 

Parochial Registers. — The registers of the parish commence in 
the year 1644. They are regular in the registration of births and 
marriages, excepting during the reign of James, till 1770. From 
that period till 1825, they are very imperfect. During the last 
twelve years they have been kept with great care, embracing al- 
most all that have been born or that have died within the parish, 
not, as is sometimes the case, only those that were baptised or 
buried in the parish. The session records begin in 1734, and, 
with the exception of a few years, about fifty years ago, are com- 
plete from that period. From these records, instances of immo- 
rality appear to have been as frequent in former days as in our 
own age, though there were undoubtedly more examples of men 
of ardent piety, and of zealous attendance on sacred ordinances.

There are three resident proprietors with more than L. 50 of 
rental. From the number of baptisms registered, the population 
appears to have been as large two centuries ago as at present. 

The food and clothing of the people are superior to what they

■were forty years ago, and have improved even within the last ten years. 
A very great improvement has also taken place in the houses of the 
tenantry, but, with a few exceptions near Blairquhan and Berbeth, 
and among the feuars in Patna, there has been no improvement in 
the accommodation of the labourers, and mechanics, and cotmen. 
Straiton is still a neat, clean, and regular village, but some houses, 
which forty years ago contained only one family, now contain two, 
and the houses are not now in such order as when recently built. 
The proprietors are averse to grant feus, or to build houses them- 
selves, and there has been in consequence a demand for dwellings 
beyond the supply. The increase of population has arisen from 
the improvements in agriculture in all parts of the parish, and 
from the coal and lime having been wrought more extensively at 
Patna.

The trees planted are larch, spruce, silver, and Scotch firs, oak, 
beech, elm, and ash. The plantations are managed on the most 
judicious principles, and are now making a profitable return to the 
proprietors by the sales of wood and bark. 

Bent of Land.— The maximum rent of arable land is L. 3, 12s. 
per Scots acre. The average may be L. 1, 10s. The grazmg of 
a cow varies from L. '2 to L. 4; of a sheep in the hdls, from 4s. 
to 5s., and in the low ground from 8s. to 10s. yearly. 

Bate of Labour.— A ploughman's wages when he lives m the 
master's house may average L. 13 yearly, and a good female ser- 
vant's L. 7, 10s. There has been a more than usual demand tor 
female servants, in consequence of the number who have lately 
become Ayrshire needle-workers. This employment occupies 
about thirty in this parish, who, when expert sewers, earn at present 
Is. a day. The rate of wages for country labourers varies with

the time of year, and the demand, but those employed constantly 
have been paid for the last twelve years 9s. weekly in summer, and 
8s. weekly in winter. The shepherds are paid chiefly by certain 
privileges, which vary in value, and which are usually believed to 
secure them more comfort than a labourer can enjoy. The wages 
of the colliers are on an average 18s., and are at present above a 
guinea a week when they are fully employed. Many children are 
occupied in sumrner among the turnip fields, who are paid 4s. 
weekly, and whose health is rather improved by a few months of 
rural labour. Since this system began, the parish school has been 
fuller in winter, parents being better enabled to have their children 
educated. 

Live-Stock, Sfc. — The Galloway cows, which formerly were kept 
by almost all the farmers, have given place in a great measure to 
the Ayrshire breed ; although the bulls are still often Galloways, 
that the stock may answer the English market. The sheep are 
nearly all of the black-faced kind, but the Cheviot have been lately 
introduced, and if the high prices of wool continue, will probably 
extend over the district. 

The spirit of improvement in husbandry has been in great ac- 
tivity for twenty years. It began on the lands around Blairquhan, 
was afterwards extended to the farms in the valley, particularly 
Dalmorton, and has of late reached the lands near Berbeth, and 
the farm of Grimmet on the Doon. The cultivation of turnips is 
rapidly extending along the banks of the Girvan, the dry gravelly . 
soil being favourable to this crop. Wheat is sown to some extent, 
and one field has been at great expense prepared for irrigation. 
Bone manure has been used for ten years, and is found particular- 
ly suitable in those fields in which there is a great declivity. Sur- 
face draining has been carried on extensively on the pasture lands ; 
and common stone-draining on the arable lands. Of late tyle- 
draining has been introduced, and would be prosecuted on a larger 
scale, could a clay bed for the manufacture be found. 

The leases are usually for nineteen years. Most of the farmers 
have comfortable houses two storeys high, and suitable buildings 
for their cattle, all slated and finished in a neat and substantial 
manner. The greater part of the farm-houses, indeed, have been 
rebuilt within the last fifteen years, and the appearance of the val- 
ley of the Girvan, from neat houses, and good cultivation, and na- 
tural beauty, is rarely equalled.

There are 3eventeen thrashing-mills, and two saw-mills in the

the parish may be

which for the last seven years may average L. 1200. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The market frequented by the parishioners is Ayr, fourteen miles 
distant from the village, and twenty-six from the farthest farm-house. 
The villages are Straiten and Patna. Straiten was mostly rebuilt 
seventy years ago, and contains 330 inhabitants. Patna has been 
wholly built within the present century, and contains 220 inhabi- 
tants. It is on the banks of the Doon, distant from Straiton by the 
public road seven miles, and by the moor, which walkers and riders 
only can cross, and which is almost impassable in winter, four miles 
and a-half. 

A penny-post ofRce under Maybole was established five years 
ago at Straiton. The length of turnpike roads running through 
the parish is twenty-three miles. There are ten stone bridges with- 
in the parish or on its borders, and two wooden bridges designed 
for carriages, besides four for foot-passengers. A coach was run 
from Ayr to Newton- Stewart, through Straiton, about fourteen 
years, for a short time, but wa:s found unprofitable. In 1832, a 
coach ran for a few months between Straiton and Ayr. At Keirs 
bridge, four and a-half miles from Straiton, or at Dalmellington, 
six and a-half miles distant, the coach running between Ayr and 
Dumfries may be got. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church is a very plain building, some 
centuries old, which was altered and repaired in 1787, and again 
in 1813. Attached to it is an aisle of Gothic architecture, which 
is believed to have been a part of the ancient church before the 
Reformation, and is now the private gallery of Sir David Hunler 



STIIAITON. '" 



Blair. In ancient times the church was dedicated to St Cuth- 
bert.  Duncan, Earl of Carrick, in the reign of Alexander il. 
granted it to the monks of Paisley. It was afterwards transferred 
to the monastery of Crossraguel. Robert Bruce confirmed this 
transfer. At the Reformation the patronage became vested in 
the Crown. The church accommodates only 414 persons, at the 
usual allowance for a sitting, though in July the audience is often 
considerably greater. There are fifty sittings in the communion 
seats at the disposal of the session. The church is more than eight 
miles from one extremity of the parish, and more than twelve miles 
from the other. Before the building of Patna village, it was in the 
centre of the population, according to the sound principles laid 
down by the ingenious author of the Manse Garden. There is 
still no place where it could be properly fixed, except the present 
site. The manse, which is a plain building, of the size common in 
1795, when it was erected, is striking in situation, and is a pleasant 
residence in summer. The glebe is between 7 and 8 acres in' 
extent, of the value of L. 16 yearly. The stipend is 15 chal- 
ders, half meal, half barley, and has averaged for the last five years 
L. 225. The sum of L. 8, 6s. 8d. is allowed for communion ele- 
ments. 

There is no church or chapel except the parish church ; but a 
small chapel in connection with the Established Church, has just 
been contracted for at Patna, and is to be finished in October 
next. Since the year 1817, there has been pubUc worship occa- 
sionally at Patna by the parish ministers, and frequently since 
1830, by preachers of the United Secession. There has been 
regular service in different rooms of that village since last autumn, 
both by the Church and the Secession. A free site for a chapel 
of the Estabhshment was granted in June 1836, by the Honour- 
able Mrs Leslie Cumming, and subscriptions have been collecting 
since that time. The building will have no gallery, but will be 
constructed to admit of one being added at any time. The popu- 
lation that will be benefited by this chapel is at present 621, of 
whom 411 are in Straiten parish, and 210 in the parishes of Dal- 
mellington, Dalrymple, Kirkmichael, Ochiltree, and Coylton. 
The whole of this population is from four to seven miles from any 
church, and the case seems one that deserves as it needs the aid 
of Government, under whose notice it has been brought through 

 Chalmers's Caledonia.

AYRSHIRE. 



the Royal Commission. Of the population of 621 near Patna 
580 profess to be of the Established Church. 

In March 1836, the population of Straiten parish was ascer- 
tained to be 1417. There were 289 families, of whom 280 were 
of the Established Church, and 9 of other denominations. Of 
the whole population 1383 were of the Established Church, and 
34 of other bodies of Christians. But the number of commu- 
nicants appears to be the correct method of fixing the religious 
professions of the people. The communicants of the Established 
Church were 642; of the United Secession 11 ; of the Reformed 
Presbytery 2 ; of the Roman Catholic 3 ; and of three other bo- 
dies one each. In the number of Dissenters only six live within 
four miles of Straiten. Several families living on the higher banks 
of the Doon, attend Dalmellington church. The attendance at 
church in summer is good. There are only 800 souls within the 
distance of four miles from church. The average number of 
young communicants for the last three years has been 31, and 
the number joining in communion 570. 

The church collections have gradually increased from the time 
to which the account extends till the present time. The yearly 
average amount for five years preceding 1710, was L. 9 ; 1790, 
L.24; 1826, L. 31 ; 1837, L. 37. For other purposes the collec- 
tions have averaged L. 5 yearly. 

The ministers of Straiten prior to the reign of Charles I. can- 
not be ascertained. Mr David M'Quorne, and Mr George Mich 
preceded the Revolution. Since that time the ordinations have 

been: 1690, Mr Alexander Kennedy; 19th Sep. 1738, Mr 

Robert Walker; 3d August 1749, Mr John M'Dermont Fer- 
gushill; 21st April 1791, Dr William Crawford; 1st May 1817, 
Mr John Paul; 22d April 1824, the present incumbent. 

Mr Walker was translated to Leith and Edinburgh, and has 
left a durable monument of his talents and piety in his admirable 
sermons. Dr Crawford became Professor of Moral Philosophy 
at St Andrews. Mr Paul is now one of the ministers of St Cuth- 
berts, Edinburgh. 

Education. — There are two parochial schools, at which all the 
usual branches are taught. The Straiton schoolmaster has a 
salary of L. 31, 10s. the legal accommodation, and fees amounting 
to L. 32. The Patna teacher has a salary of L. 11, a house and 
school-house from the proprietor, and fees varying from L. 20 to 
L. 25. The charge for reading is 3s. and for other branches a 



STRAITON. 



345 



little more in addition per quarter. There are few children above 
ten years of age unable to read. Four families have teachers in 
their houses. Last month the number attending Straiten school 
was 86, and Patna 60, and all the schools, public and private, 170, 
or about one-eighth of the whole population. The total number 
attending in the course of a year for longer or shorter periods, — 
a test which we believe is often used, may be 240, or one- sixth of 
the whole population. The number of Latin scholars has been gra- 
dually diminishing, and for some years has been only one. Geo- 
graphy is by degrees studied more and more. 

There is a parish library at Straiton, possessing between 400 
and 500 volumes. There are two Sabbath schools, one at Strai- 
ton, taught by myself, and attended by 45 children and young 
people, and one at Patna, attended by 35, which is taught by 
the schoolmaster and elder of the district. 

Friendly Societies, Sj-c. — The parish has two societies of this 
kind, one formed in 1812, and the other in 1818. The one has 
L. 50 of funds, and the other about L. 80. The members in both 
amount to 130. The aliment allowed is 6s. weekly to bed-rid 
members, and 3s. to the sick that can walk about ; and for fune- 
rals an allowance of L. 2, 10s. is given. They are highly useful, 
though they would be still more beneficial were they deemed only 
subordinate 'to savings banks. In 1829, a bank of this kind was 
established at Maybole, with a branch at Straiton. Though it 
was warmly recommended both privately and from the pulpit, it 
has not been by any means successful. The farm-servants are 
paid half-yearly, and when they wish to be provident, open an ac- 
count for themselves in a bank in Ayr. The villagers, who might 
economize, are unwilling to let their circumstances be known. 
Notwithstanding the apparent failure of the bank in this parish, I 
have no doubt that the aggregate of the sums, which servants, la- 
bourers, and mechanics, have saved and deposited in banks, amounts 
to L. 1000 or L. 2000. And since the feeling which prompts to 
secret saving is characteristic of Scotsmen, it has occurred to the 
writer of this account, that it would be for the good of the work- 
ing classes were the ordinary banks in provincial towns to receive 
smaller sums in deposit than they do at present. 

Poor. — The average number of regular paupers for the last 
five years has been 26, about the same number as were twenty 
years ago. The average monthly allowance may be 5s. con- 
siderably more than was given twenty years ago. The an- 



346 



AYRSHIRE. 



nual cost ranges from L. 2 to L. 7, the average being L. 3, 2s. 
Among them are two children, of whom one, who is in the 
Edinburgh Blind Asylum, is supported chiefly from a separate 
fund. The poor cost nearly L. 80 yearly, on an average, of which 
L. 37 is raised from collections, L. 8 from other sessional sources, 
and L. 35 by a voluntary contribution among the heritors. Though 
contributions from the heritors were first paid in the year 1819, 
sums equal to them in amount had been taken, for seven years pre- 
vious, from the stock. The habit of parishioners leaving legacies 
to the poor ceased entirely in 1814, and was the cause of contri- 
butions from the heritors being required. Coals are annually dis- 
tributed to the poor, both by Lady Hunter Blair, and by the kirk- 
session, and many poor householders receive aid from Blairquhan. 
Taking into account private charity as well as the session disburse- 
ments, and also what relations give, the paupers seem to have 
nearly an equal amount of aliment with a married labourer who 
has a large family. Many of them earn a little by their own in- 
dustry. In so far as the writer can judge, the poor are likely to 
require more for the future than the past, chiefly from the standard 
of living always becoming higher among the working classes. This 
both renders their support more expensive, and diminishes the 
power of sons and daughters to assist their aged parents. In judg- 
ing of the cost of the poor in different parishes, it is usual to look 
only to the existing population ; but this method is quite erroneous. 
The new families, in a rapidly increasing population, being young, 
are never burdensome. The true criterion is the population 
twenty or thirty years ago. By this test, the apparent anomalies 
of certain parishes in Ayrshire may be explained ; for the number 
and cost of paupers will be found to be in proportion throughout 
almost all, to their respective populations, thirty years ago. It 
may also be observed that, in an extensive rural parish like Straiton, 
a large amount is contributed towards the support of the poor of the 
manufacturing parishes in alms to vagrants. Begging has never been 
so prevalent since the measures employed for its suppression m the 
year 1832, yet, by a moderate calculation, the sum given to va- 
grants in this parish is estimated at L. 160; fully more than our own 
poor receive from all sources whatever. There are two or three 
persons residing in Straiton parish that sometimes seek alms over 
the country; and a number of the paupers go among the farm- 
houses twice a-year, in summer for wool, and in winter for butcher 
meat. All the paupers except one are of Scottish origui, and the 



STRAITON. 



347 



greater number are natives of Straiten. There are indeed only a 
few Irish fanailies in the parish. 

Inns. — There are usually four houses licensed in Straiten, and 
one in Patna, — fewer than were when last Account was written, but 
more than are required, and than are either profitable to the per- 
sons licensed, or useful to the parish. 

Fuel. — The fuel used in the lower part of the parish is coal, 
which is brought from Patna, Dalmellington, and Dailly. Peat is 
used to some extent in the more distant farm-houses, and exclu- 
sively in the houses that have no good access to the public roads. 
The average price of coal at Patna and Dalmellington is 3s. 6d. 
and delivered in Straiton village, 8s. per imperial ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

' Th6 parish has undergone great changes since 1792, when the 
former Account was written. The population has risen from 934 
to 1417. The rental has increased from 1. 3000 to nearly 
L. 9000, and is at present larger and almost as promptly paid as 
at any period during the war. The village of Patna has been 
built, the mansion of Blairquhan erected, and almost all the lar- 
ger farmers furnished with excellent new houses and offices. The 
land under tillage has been rendered more productive, and several 
hundred acres reclaimed. Carts were then the only conveyances. 
There are now eight taxable carriages among the farmers, besides 
those of the resident proprietors. A new road, which runs for ten 
miles through the parish, has been made from Ayr to Newton- 
Stewart, and has been executed with taste and skill. The road 
to Dalmellington has been improved. The old road to Patna has 
been abandoned, and a better but more circuitous one formed. The 
physical improvements chiefly required are still such as would 
render the different parts of the parish more accessible, particular- 
ly an improved line of road to Dalmellington, a shorter road to 
Patna, and two roads from Glenacchy on the Girvan, to connect 
that part of the parish with Dalmellington, on the one side, and 
the foot of Loch Doon on the other. As the resident proprietors. 
Sir David Hunter Blair, Bart, and the Honourable Colonel Ma- 
cadam Cathcart, have shewn a desire to promote the improvements 
of the parish, it is hoped these changes will gradually be made. 

A neater style of building cottages, such as has already been in- 
troduced near Blairquhan and Berbeth, may also be expected to 
prevail.

PIIESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. GEORGE GRAY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Jame. — The derivation of the name of the town and parish of 
Maybole, in the former Statistical Account, from Maypole, must 
be regarded as purely fanciful. Chalmers, in his Caledonia, says, 
that the earliest notice of the name is in a charter of Henry HI., 
in Hearne's Liber Niger, viz. " in 1192, Duncan, the son of Gil- 
bert di Galiveia, gave to God and St Mary, of Maelros a certain 
piece of land in Carrie, named Maybothel." And he suggests in 
consequence an Anglo-Saxon derivation, from the common " bottle" 
or " hothel" signifying a house, farm, or village, and " May," which 
may either be considered the name of a person, or a derivative 
from the word signifying a kinsman. And in support of this in- 
terpretation, " the dwelling of the kinsman," it may be alleged that 
several names and usages of this district are undoubtedly Saxon, 
and to be traced to the period of the Heptarchy, when Galloway 
and the southern parts of Ayrshire were overrun by the Northum- 
brians. At the same time, it must be remembered, that the Scots 
from Ireland and Argyle took possession of the country so early 
as the ninth century; that the Gaelic language was very gene- 
rally spoken throughout the whole country along the Frith of Clyde, 
even in the time of Buchanan ; that the names of the district of 
Carrick, of which Maybole is the principal town, and of many of the 
neighbouring farms, hills, and streams, are Gaelic; and that all these 
circumstances would naturally lead us to trace the name of May- 
bole to a similar origin. There is, however, considerable difficul- 
ty in assigning it to its proper Celtic roots, from the different ways 
in which the name is written, even in very ancient records. Some- 
times it is found Maiboil, and at other times Minnybole, with nu- 
merous variations in the orthography of each ; and as either may be 
adopted, will signify the heath ground upon the marsh or meadow, 



MAYBOLE. 



349 



both of which names are so far descriptive of the situation of the 
town, which stands upon a decUvity, — no doubt at one time covered 
with heath, and at the bottom of which there is a tract of meadow 
land which must at one time also have been a marsh. 

Extent, Boundaries, c. — The parish contains about 34 square 
miles; its greatest length as the cro flies being 9, and its 
greatest breadth 5 miles. It is bounded on the north, and so far on 
the east by the river Doon, which divides it from the parishes of 
Ayr and Dalrymple ; on the east and south by Kirkmichael, and 
the water of Girvan ; and on the west by Kirkoswald and the Frith 
of Clyde. It is somewhat of an oblong figure, and towards the 
north-east is traversed by a tract of high land, called Brown Car- 
rick Hill, which rises over the sea and the river Doon. This hilly 
range is covered with heath, and rises to the height of about 1000 
feet above the level of the sea, and nothing can exceed the beauty 
and grandeur of the views commanded by its summits. Looking 
towards the north, the fertile fields of Kyle — the town of Ayr with 
its spires and shipping, surrounded by villas and mansion-houses — 
the classic and richly wooded banks of the Ayr and Doon — Kirk 
Alloway — the humble place of its poet's birth, and the splendid 
monument to his memory — lie iminediately beneath ; while the 
waters of the frith, studded'with sails and bounded with the mag- 
nificent fi-ame-work of Goatfell and the mountains of the western 
Highlands, terminate the splendid prospect. Looking again to- 
wards the south, the district of Carrick, with its undulating fields, 
wooded valleys, and green hills, stretches away to the horizon in 
humbler but not less pleasing perspective. 

Climate. — The climate does not differ materially from that which 
prevails over the west coast of Scotland. Upon the whole, it must 
be considered conducive to good health. Remarkable instances of 
longevity are numerous, and endemic diseases are neither very fre- 
quent nor severe. It is indeed worthy of notice, that a tradition very 
generally prevails, that during the last infliction of the plague in 
Scotland, and while it raged with great virulence in the town of 
Ayr and the surrounding neighbourhood, it never reached May- 
bole, and that a curious confirmation of this immunity was given 
to the inhabitants in their entire exemption from the late visitations 
of the cholera. 

 This measurement is taken in the common way tVom the county map, and is pro- 
bably far from being accurate. By the returns of the different farmers there are 20681 
imperial acres.

Sprinffs.— There are several chalybeate springs in the parish, 
which in former times were valued for their healing virtues ; but 
the only waters now prized are those from the excellent wells, 
which are found in every quarter. From the sloping grounds on 
which the town is built in particular, and which consist of strata 
of red sandstone, occasionally cropping out, springs of the purest 
water gush in abundance, and contribute largely to the health 
and comfort of the inhabitants. Most of these, indeed, vary 
in their supplies, and sometimes in the autumn of a dry season 
altogether withhold them ; but there is one well worthy of notice, 
situate at the base of the declivity, called from the copiousness 
and velocity with which it issues from the rock, and some old trees 
that overhang it, the Well Trees Spout. The stream that flows 
from it never perceptibly diminishes, and is of sufficient magnitude 
to drive the wheel of a mill, to which purpose it was at one time 
applied ; and by a measurement lately made with great care by 
Mr Andrews, the produce of the spring is not less than 10,000 
imperial gallons per hour. 

Bivers.—The rivers are the parts of the Doon and Girvan al- 
ready noticed in describing the boundaries ; and the only thing 
deservino- of observation, as connected with the parish, is a change 
which has taken place in the course of the Doon, near its con- 
fluence with the sea. While it forms the northern boundary of 
the parish, from Cassilis to within a quarter of a mile of its mouth, 
it there ceases to do so; and the lands of Cunnan Park, a holm 
amounting to about fifty acres, are included in Maybole, although 
now on the Ayr side of the river. Upon examining, however, the 
exterior line of this holm, it is not difficult to observe the traces 
of an old water course ; and there can be little doubt of what tra- 
dition affirms, that the Doon, when the boundaries of the parish 
were assigned, found its way by this course into the ocean The 
old channel was quite circuitous ; and when it is urther observed 
that the sea is receding from the coast, having left even within 
the last forty years seven acres of land attached to Cunnan i'ark, 
it is not at all surprising that the waters made for themselves the 
present short and less sluggish course, which may be described as 
the chord, of which the old one is the arc.  

 A tradition indeed prevails that the l- ZZ'.

Geology and Mhwalogy. — The sea coast affords a very distinct 
view of the geological structure of the parish, which may be ge- 
nerally described as composed of slightly inclined beds of red 
sandstone, traversed at frequent intervals by trap, sometimes in 
the form of dikes, and at other times of masses rising into hills. 
This structure, though simple in itself, is yet possessed of much 
interest, from recent speculations respecting the types to which 
the sandstones of the opposite coast of Arran should be re- 
ferred. 

Mr Murchison and Professor Sedgwick have published their 
views of the Arran strata in the Geological Transactions. The 
sandstone at Glen-Sannox is referred by them to the old red sand- 
stone and conglomerate ; and there can be little doubt of the ac- 
curacy of this conclusion, because there is a distinct point or axis 
from which the red sandstone dips in opposite directions, in each 
of which it is surmounted by a carboniferous series, which is, how- 
ever, towards the south, obscurely developed. Towards the north, 
this series is covered by an upper red sandstone and conglomerate, 
which, at the time of examination, they were inclined to rank as 
the equivalents of the new red sandstone of England ; although 
Professor Jameson, we understand, maintained that they were mem- 
bers of the coal formation. Professor Sedgwick, on reconsidering 
the subject, seems now disposed to view them as a great develop- 
ment of the carboniferous red sandstone. 

For the determining of these points, an accurate examination of 
the corresponding strata of the Ayrshire coast has been much de- 
sired ; and in the hope that the Statistical Accounts of the several 
parishes may contain descriptions of the portions they embrace, I 
have thought it proper to give the following brief notices of the 
appearances of the strata in this parish. 

From the banks of the Doon to the Heads of Ayr, we find thin 
beds of sandstone, limestone, ironstone, and shale, dipping at an 
angle of from ten to fifteen degrees to the north-east under the 
Ayr coal field, and obviously belonging to the carboniferous series. 
These are frequently cut by trap dikes; and at Greenan Castle, the 
trap is observed overlying the sandstone. The Heads of Ayr consist 
of a black earthy tufaceous trap, rising to about 200 feet, traversed at 
one part by a thick, hard, basaltic vein. To the south of the Heads 
we find strata of red sandstone and conglomerate, dipping, like those 
formerly noticed, towards the north-east, and traversed also by dikes 



352 



AYRSHIRE. 



resembling the trap of the Heads in their proximity, and again at a 
distance becoming quite hard and basaltic. The whole coast onward 
to the Rancoch Glen, the southern boundary of the parish, may 
be described as similarly constituted, — the sandstone and conglo- 
merate having throughout the same dip, and the trap appearing 
at intervals, either in veins or rising in more largely developed 
masses, forming lofty cliffs. It is, however, obvious that the strata 
now referred to are quite of a different character from those ob- 
served on the northern side of the Heads. The beds of sandstone 
are of a redder colour and greater thickness, and often pass into 
conglomerate ; and, as their inclination shows that they dip under 
the former, which belong to the carboniferous series, we can have 
no hesitation in assigning them to the old red sandstone, and as 
occupying the same relative position with the sandstone on the 
north side of the anticlinal axis in Glen Sannox. 

The prosecution of the survey along the coast of the parish of 
Kirkoswald, it may be added, presents a strong proof of the ac- 
curacy of this conclusion. The sandstone between the Rancoch 
Glen and the trap of Culzean Castle rock, at the Maidens, and for 
a considerable stretch of the coast beyond Turnbury, still main- 
tains the same character and dip till within about half a mile of the 
farm of Dowhill, when the inclination changes to the south-west, 
and the strata then dip under the carboniferous series of the Gir- 
van water, in correspondence with what is observed on the south- 
ern side of the Glen Sannox axis. 

In tracing the strata stretching throughout the inland part of 
the parish, we find the same appearances as have been noticed on 
the line of coast. The whole of the red sandstone north and east 
of the town of Maybole dips towards the north-east under the coal 
measures of the Ayr field, and again, on approaching the Girvan 
water by the Kilkerran road, we observe it changing to the 
south-west, and dipping under the coal in the trough of that 
river. 

Crystals of quartz of an amethyst colour are found in the trap 
at How-muir. The agates of the trap upon the coast have been 
much sought after, and are frequently of great size and beauty. 
The sandstone at the quarry of St Murrays often affords beautiful 
specimens of arborescence, from the presence of the black oxide of 
manganese, and it is traversed by veins of lead-ore, which have been 
noticed at Knockdon and the manse.

Fpssil Organic Remains. — Towards the southern boundary of 
the parish there are a series of hollows between the undulations of 
the sandstone, some of them still in the state of lochs, and others 
of marshes. On draining some of them, it has been found, that, 
after penetrating a bed of soil and moss of about eight to ten feet in 
thickness, great deposits of marl occur, containing an immense 
number of organic remains. It is to be regretted, that, at the time 
the marl was excavated, no greater attention than what curiosity 
prompted was directed towards these interesting relics. Portions 
of different animals have, however, been preserved ; and for the 
following notice of the heads of the elk and bos in the possession 
of Mr Kennedy of Drummellan, I am indebted to Dr M'Tyer of 
Redbrae, as also for the zoological notices which follow, and which 
will be found to include several rare species. 

The fossil head of the Cervus megaceros differs from the speci- 
men in the museum of the Royal Society of Dublin, in the head 
being larger, and the horns a little less, probably from the Drum- 
mellan animal having been aged. The dimensions of the two spe- 
cimens are as follows ;

The other head appears to have belonged to a variety of Bos 
taurus, the forehead being concave. It measures ten inches be- 
tween the horns, and 13i inches round the bole of the horn. 
Horns of the Cervus elephas were also found. Amongst the shells 
in the marl I have only observed specimens of Limnea and Pla- 
norhis.

An eyry of the falcon or game hawk is found annually on the 
Heads of Ayr. The motions of the birds over the cliffs are extreme- 
ly beautiful, and they have been much prized for the purposes of 
falconry. It is said that some birds, as the common goldfinch for 
example, have become much less numerous, in consequence of the 
increased cultivation of the country. 

The following shell-fish, important in an economical point of 
view, are found upon the coast, but, with the exception of the first, 
are very scarce: Mytilus edulis, Ostrea eduUs, Cardium edule, 

Pecten maximus.  

Botany. The field for botanical research is extensive and di- 
versified. Several miles of a rocky coast, an extensive tract of 
light dry land, a hilly range of some miles in length, with marshes 
and heaths on the surface, and a series of fresh water lochs and 
meadows, afford a great variety of localities and a number of rare 
plants. Mr James Smith of Monkwood, whose labours have en- 
riched the catalogue of our Scottish species, has examined all 
these localities, and I have been chiefly indebted to him for the 
following list, several of which have been discovered and named 
by himself. The list might have been greatly extended, but it 
will be obvious that even it embraces many plants which cannot 
be considered as rare. They are arranged according to the Lin- 
nean system, and the localities are added.

II. — Civil History. 
I am not aware of any works, printed or MS. devoted entirely 
to the history of this parish, but there are several documents of 
considerable interest illustrative of past events, and which refer 
largely to it. The chief of these are, the " Historie of the Ken- 
nedyis," published in 1830, from an original MS. in the library 
of the Faculty of Advocates, by Mr Pitcairn ; — an account, by 
John Knox, published in 1563, of a disputation held betwixt him 
and Quentin Kennedy, Abbot of Crossraguel, in the town of May- 
bole, the only copy of which was in the Auchinleck Library, but 
a fac-simile of which was reprinted by Sir Alexander Boswell in 
1812;— and, lastly, « A Description of Carrick, by Mr William 
Abercrummie, minister at Maybole," and which has also been 
printed from Macfarlan's MS. in the Advocates' Library, by Mr 



35G 



AYRSHIRE. 



Pitcairn, forming No. 3 of his Appendix to the History of the 
Kennedys. Great hght has been thrown by these works both on 
the civil and ecclesiastical state of the country, at and before the 
accession of King James to the English throne ; and the following 
notices of events, the scenes of which were laid in this parish, 
have appeared to me not only of local, but even of such general 
interest as justly to entitle them to a place in this Account. I 
shall particularly notice two of those events, not only as remarkable 
in themselves, but as intimately connected with the history of the 
Reformation, and as setting forth, in striking colours, that union 
of religious zeal and feudal violence by which its triumphs were 
at first achieved. 

One of the most learned, upright, and liberal of the servants of 
Popery, at the period when Knox was attacking and levelling its 
strongliolds, was Quentin Kennedy, uncle of the Earl of Cassdis, 
and Abbot of Crossraguel ; and after the publication of several 
tracts on the controversy raised by the doctrines of the Reformer, 
he, in the year 1561, proclaimed himself, in his chapel of Kirk- 
Oswald, ready to defend the mas against any one who would im- 
pugn it,— a challenge which Knox failed not to accept of. After 
a very interesting correspondence about the place of meeting, 
Knox insisting on all possible publicity, and the abbot objecting 
to this, on the grounds of desiring to avoid tumult, and his pre- 
ference of a hmited audience, as in all respects better fitted to 
judge fairly of the matters in dispute ; they at length agreed to 
meet in the house of the Provost of Maybole, with forty persons 
on each side, and notaries to record their arguments and proceed- 
ings. 11- 

Accordingly, on the 28th day of September, these champions, 
accompanied with their several retinues, including several of the 
nobles and gentry of the country, entered Maybole, and met in a 
iingy-panelled room, in the house of the provost, which still re- 
mains, and is now occupied as the tavern of the Red Lion. 
Their meeting was characteristic. Knox immediately suggest- 
ed the propriety of commencing the proceedings with prayer; 
and, on the abbot being offended at the proposal, he would yet m 
nowise be stayed, and he and his followers had of course to give 
audience. The abbot seems soon to have been subdued by 
the power and fervency of Knox's supplications, and honestly 
Yielding to his feelings, he said at the close, « Be my faith, it is 
well said." The controversy turned chiefly on the priesthood

of Melchisedec, as bearing on the sacrifice of the mass, prefigur- 
ed, according to the Papists, by his oilering of bread and wine. 
There was, however, notwithstanding the learning and acuteness 
displayed on both sides, a good deal of quibbling and tedious 
altercation ; and after the dispute had been prolonged for three 
days, without ever embracing any of the great points between the 
contending parties, the noblemen and gentry, cooped up in a small 
apartment, and ill-supplied with suitable entertainment and ac- 
commodation, withdrew, and the dispute never was resumed. 
But although the meeting brought out nothing new touching 
the matter in dispute, it was not without its influence in forward- 
ing the great work of the Reformation. Public attention could 
not fail to be directed by such a conference to the enlightened 
views and the holy purposes of Knox ; and a lively sense of the 
services which he did to their forefathers, has descended to their 
children of the present day. The inhabitants of Maybole have 
instituted a " Knox Club," which holds a triennial festival, at which 
men of all parties meet, to testify their gratitude for their deliver- 
ance from the domination of Rome, and their secure enjoyment 
of Protestant principles, achieved for them by Knox and his coad- 
jutors, 

But while Popery was thus shaken by the weapons of reason 
and of truth, there were many altogether indifferent to the Pro- 
testant cause, who were yet ready to join in the attack on the fal- 
ling fabric of the church, for the purpose of seizing on its revenues 
and power ; and I have next to relate, as an instance of this, one 
of the most remarkable scenes recorded in provincial history. 
Quentin Kennedy was succeeded in his office of Abbot of Cross- 
raguel by Allan Stewart, and the barbarous treatment to which he 
was subjected, to wring from him the titles of his property, forms 
a striking part of the " History of the Kennedys." The most 
graphic account, however, of the transaction is given by Richard 
Bannatyne in his " Memoriales," which is quoted by Mr Pitcairn 
in his excellent notes ; and it may also be added, that every part 
of Bannatyne's narrative is distinctly confirmed by the abbot's own 
statements in his " bill of supplication to the Lords of Privy- Coun- 
cil." Gilbert, fourth Earl of Cassilis, appears to have been a man 
of most rapacious and unscrupulous character. He had already, 
by forgery and murder, possessed himself of the abbacy of Glen-

luce ; and he only waited a proper opportunity to attach Cross- 
raguel, lying in his vicinity, to his estates. Allan Stewart, the 
abbot, who lived under the protection of the Laird of Bargany, 
was at length, under hospitable pretences, enticed to leave his 
safeguard, and to pass some days in Maybole with Thomas Ken- 
nedy, brother of the Earl, from whence he was taken to the Castle 
of Dunure, the original seat of the family, and the ruins of which 
still stand gloomily on a rock, whose base is washed by the sea on 
the western boundary of theparish. But we give the words of the 
original account : 

' Efter the which the said Mr Allane passed with quyet com- 
pany to visie the place and boundes of Croceraguall, whairof the 
said Erie being surelie advertised, determined to put in practeis the 
tyrany which long before he had conceaved. And so, as king of 
the countrie, apprehendit the said Mr Allane, and carried him to 
the house of Dunure, where for a seasone he was honourablie en- 
treated gif a prisoner can think ony interteanment pleasing : but 
after that certaine dayis were spent, and that the Erie culd not ob- 
tene the fewis of Croceraguall according to his awin appetite, he 
determined to prove gif a collatione could work that, which neather 
dennor nor supper could doe of a long tyme. And so, the said Mr 
Allane was carried to a secret chalmer ; with him passed the ho- 
nourable Erie, his worschepful brother, and sic as was appointed 
to be servantis at that banquet. In the chalmer there was a grit 
iron chimlay, under it a fyre : other grit provesione was not sene. 
The first cours was, ' my Lord Abbot said the Erie it will pleis 
you cofifess heir, that with your awin consent ye remane in my 
company, becaus ye darre not comitt you to the handis of utheris.' 
The Abbote answerit, ' Wald ye, my Lord, that I should mak a ma- 
nifest leising, for your pleasour  The treuth is, my Lord, it is 
against my will that I am heir ; neither yet have I ony pleasour in 
your company.' — ' Bot ye sail remane with me at this tyme,' said 
the Erie. — ' I am not able to resist your will and pleasour,' said the 
Abbote, ' in this place.' — ' Ye man then obey me ' said the Erie. 
And with that were presented unto him certane letteris to subscryve, 
amonges which there was a fyve yeare tack and a 19 yeare 
tack, and a charter of feu of all landis of Croceraguall, with all the 
clausses necessaire for the Erie to haist him to hell  For gif adul- 
terie, sacriledge, oppressions, barbarous creweltis, and thift heap-

for a cessone, as followes. 

' Efter that the Erie espyed repugnance, and that he culd not 
come to his purpose be fair means, he comandit his coockis to pre- 
pare the banquet. And so first, they fleed the scheip, that is, they 
took of the Abbotis cleathes, even to his skyn : And nixt, they band 
him to the chimlay, his leggis to the one end and his armes tothe 
uther ; and so they began to bait the fyre, sometymes to his but- 
tockis, sometymes to his leggis, sometymes to his shulderis and 
armes. And that the rost suld not burne, but that it might rost in 
soppe, they spared not flambing with oyle. Lord luik thou to sie 
creweltie. And that the crying of the miiserable man suld not be 
hard, they closed his mouth, that the voice myght be stopped. In 
that torment they held the poore man, whill that oft-tymes he cry- 
ed, ' for Godis sake to despatch him : for he had as mekle gold in 
his awn purse, as wad buy poulder aneugh, to shorten his paine.' 
The famous King of Carrick, and his coockes, perceiving the rost to 
be aneugh, comandit it to be tane fra the fyre, and the Erie him- 
self began the grace in this manor : ' Benedicite Jesus, Maria  
You are the most obstinate man that ever I saw  Gif I had knowin 
that ye had been so stubborne, I wold not for a thousand crownis 
handled you so  I never did so to man befoir you.' And yet, he 
returned to the same practeis, within two days, and ceassed not till 
that he obteaned his formest purpose ; that is, that he had gotten 
all his pieces subscryvit, alsweil as ane half-rosted hand culd do it " 

It is impossible not to connect these events together, as alike in- 
dicative of the tottering state of Popery. Abbot Quentin would 
have scorned the idea of defending his religion, if Knox had not 
made him feel that it was sinking beneath his feet, and Cassilis 
would not thus unjustly have assailed his successor if he had not 
witnessed the decay of the faith which his property had been given 
to support, and it hence happened in this as in many other cases, 
that what zeal for religious liberty began, rapacity for the proper- 
ty of the church completed.  

I now turn to the state of society during this period, and am able, 
from the history of the Kennedys and other sources, to produce 
from the annals of the parish of Maybole, some of the most vivid 
illustrations of these olden tiraes On the farm of west Enoch, a 
short way from Lady Corse, and on the south side of a small burn

that flows down the valley, there is a curious mound of earth and 
stones, nearly opposite to Bogside, which has always been regard- 
ed as the locality of some warlike exploit ; and the author of the old 
history referred to, has connected with it, by a description so gra- 
phic as not to be mistaken, a story of ruthless violence and most 
tragic interest. 

The feuds between the Earls of Cassilis and the Lairds of Bar- 
gany had been of long continuance, and were scarcely healed, till 
by some new act of treachery or violence they broke out anew. 
On the 11th day of December 1601, the Earl of Cassilis hav- 
ing learned that the Laird of Bargany was to ride from the town 
of Ayr to his own mansion on the water of Girvan, attended only 
by a few followers, determined to waylay and attack the party. He 
accordingly left his castle of Maybole with 200 armed followers, 
and took his station at the Lady Corse, about half a-mile north of 
the town. The Laird of Bargany, with his small retinue, soon ap- 
peared at the Brochloch, on the opposite side of the valley, and 
seeing the Earl thus attended, said to his men that he desired no 
feud, and would not threw himself in the Earl's way. He accord- 
ingly led them down the north bank of the rivulet by Bogside, 
thinking that in this way he might prosecute his route homewards 
without coming into collision at such disadvantage with his enemy. 
The Earl, however, determined to avail himself of his superior 
force, followed down the south side, and coming to some " feal 
dikes," which offered a good support to the fire-arras of his fol- 
lowers, they immediately began to discharge them at Bargany and 
his men.  

Bargany finding that he could not avoid the rencontre, crossed 
the burn; but on reaching the south side of it, he perceived that none 
had ventured to follow him " but the Lairdes of Auchendrayne 
and Cloncaird, James Bannatyne and Edward Irwing ;" and on 
observing this, he turned round and said, " Gude sirs, we are ower 
few " They nevertheless defended themselves with great bravery, 
and wounded or slew the first of the assailants ; but, overpowered 
with superior numbers, Auchendrayne was ere long " shott and 
hurte in the kernellis of the thie, and his horse also : James Ban- 
natyne's horse was slayne : Edward Irwing, the peadge, was slayne 
be ane straike of ane lanse. Bot now," continues our author, who 

 At no distant period a " feal dike" stretched along the side of the small burn 
near to the mound referred to, and probably formed a part of it. The names ot all 
Ihe places mentioned by the old historian still remain, and nothing can be more dis- 
tinct than the scene of the movements and onset w hich he so spiritedly relates.

speaks with enthusiiism and eloquence of Bargany, " bot now, to 
speak of the nobill youthe, how gallantly he bebaiffit him selff, my 
penne can nocht writt the same ; for being bot this way accom- 
panyitt with thir fywe menne, thair was against him the number of 
30 horsemenne, quha all geilF the charge and straikis to thir fywe. 
Yet quhan that thair wes of thame twa unhorssitt and ane slayne, 
sa that their wes nane with him bot ane, yitt he wald nocht stay 
his curradge, bot raid through me Lordis menne, hard to me 
Lord, and cryit, ' quhair is me Lord him sellf  Lett him now 
keep promise and,brek ane trie ' " This challenge was unheed- 
ed, he was pressed from all sides, and at length was basely struck 
from behind, while he was gallantly defending himself against his 
assailants. The weapon went " through the craig and through the 
thropill," and thus, mortally wounded, he was conveyed to May- 
bole, where my Lord, as " Judge Ordinar" of the country, deter- 
mined to put him to death if he showed any symptoms of recovery. 
He was, however, carried from thence to Ayr, and died in twenty- 
three hours. He appears to have been a person of great promise, 
and to have been held in high estimation, and his character is thus 
depicted by the old historian : " He was the brawest manne that 
was to be gotten in ony land ; of hiche stataur, and weill maid ; 
his hair blak, bott of ane cumlie feace ; the brawest horsemanne, 
and the best at all pastymis. For he was feerse and feirry, and' 
wonder nembill. He was about the age of 25 yieris quhane he 
was slayhe, bot of his aige the maist wyise he mycht be ; for gif he 
had tyme to had experianse to his witt, he had been by his mar- 
ravvis." 

The details of this murderous deed are not more characteristic 
of the times than the impunity with which it was passed over. It 
was, indeed, of too flagrant a nature to be left unnoticed, even in 
the " Judge Ordinar ;" but my Lady of Cassilis, who had friends 
at court, rode to Edinburgh, and obtained his Majesty's favour to 
her husband, who " gott this mukill grantit, that my Lord suld 
cum hemself, and deall with the thesaurer for his escheitt;" — " and 
by reason," as the historian farther informs us, " of ten thousand 
markis" given to that important functionary, " there was obtenit to 
me Lord ane act of cuunsall, makand all that me Lord had done 
gude service to the King " 

It must, however, be remarked, that our author is on all occa- 
sions partial to Auchendrane, who had married the daughter of 
old Bargany, the father of the youth who thus fell ; and it will be

seen, that Sir W. Scott, in his prefatory notice to the tragedy of 
Auchendrane, relates the circumstances more favourably to the 
Earl of Cassilis. 

Out of the events of this bloody action arose the series of dark 
and tragical deeds on which Sir Walter founded his tragedy. 
Auchendrane, to revenge the death of Bargany and his own wound, 
ou being apprized by Sir Thomas Kennedy of Cullayne of his in- 
tention to visit Edinburgh, instigated a party of his followers to 
waylay him at the place he had appointed for a friendly meeting, 
where they accordingly found and murdered him. Auchendrane 
was strongly suspected of being the instigator of this crime, but he 
boldly denied all knowledge of CuUayne's journey, and saw that 
no evidence of his guilt could be produced, if he could only keep 
out of the way the messenger who had given him notice of the 
place of meeting. It so happened, that the person who brought 
-the message of Cullayne to Maybole transmitted it from thence to 
Mure by the hands of a poor student of the name of Dalrymple, 
who in consequence became the object of his fears. Notwithstand- 
ino- various places of confinement at Auchendrane and the Isle of 
Arran, and even his removal to the low countries, where he served 
in Buccleuch's regiment for five or six years, Dalrymple still re- 
turned to the country, and Mure determined to trust no longer to 
temporary expedients, resolved upon his death. He was accord- 
ingly enticed by a vassal of Mure's, James Bannatyne, to his house 
at Chapeldonan, a solitary spot on the sea shore, and there, at 
midnio-ht, by the elder and younger Mures, was murdered and 
buried in the sand. The hasty and imperfect sepulture was 
immediately undone by the advancing tide, and they had re- 
course to the expedient of carrying the body out to sea, m the hope 
that the wind, which blew strongly from the shore, would remove 
for ever from their coasts the evidence of then- crmie. But Pro- 
vidence ere long brought it back to the very spot of the murder, 
and the public indignation was soon directed towards Mure, whose 
tamperings with Dalrymple had formerly been noticed. His fears 
were in consequence transferred to Bannatyne, whom, in his turn, 
he and his son attempted to murder; but Bannatyne being put 
upon his guard, eluded their stratagems. He soon, however, found 
his life so miserable, at once from the persecution of the Mures 
and the power of his own conscience, that he confessed his crime, 
and revealed all the circumstances of the foul transaction in whicli 
lie had been an accomplice. The Mures, against whom the King 



MAYBOLE. 



363 



had become already strongly prejudiced, and whom he had sub- 
jected to rigorous imprisonment, were brought to the Bar, pro- 
nounced guilty, and executed amid general execration. The pub- 
lic feeling on this occasion is not less illustrative of the charac- 
ter of the times than the leniency with which such deeds as the " 
slaughter of Bargany were viewed. The chivalry and pride of fa- 
mily feuds threw a splendour over the latter, in which their crimi- 
nality was forgotten ; while in the former case, the absence of all 
such garniture permitted the natural horror, which cold and deli- 
berate murder excites in the human breast, to come into its full 
operation. 

The ruins of the Castle of Auchendrane are still to be traced 
on the banks of the Doon, near to Monkwood Bridge, on the low 
road from Ayr to Maybole ; but the last of the family of the 
Mures long ago died in circumstances of the greatest poverty. 
The judgments of Heaven have, indeed, in their case, been visibly 
and awfully displayed. One after another perished in meanness 
and marked disgrace, and their lands passed into the hands of 
others.  

Eminent Characters. — Dr Macknight, the author of many stan- 
dard works, was admitted minister of Maybole in the year 1753; 
and while he discharged the duties of the parish most con- 
scientiously, and with great acceptance, for sixteen years, he also 
published during that time the " Harmony," and the " Truth 
of the Gospel Histories," the former in 1756, and the latter in 
1763. 

He was succeeded by Dr Wright, who was also held in great 
estimation, and who pubhshed a volume of sermons. 

The late Lord Alloway, so distinguished as a Judge in the Court 
of Session, resided during the vacations at Blairston, on the banks 
of the Doon, and took much delight in beautifying a place of great 
natural amenity. He was held in high estimation by all ranks in 
the parish".

Parochial Rec/isters. — The earliest entry of a birth is in January 
1712; and the register of births is continued regularly from that 
date down to the present day. The register of proclamations of 
banns and marriages is of a much more recent date, and does not 
seem to have been accurately kept. Tho. earliest date of minutes 
of session is December 1777. A very accurate register of deaths, 
and the age and the diseases of the deceased, has been kept for 
the last few years ; and the mode of furnishing a document so im- 
portant is at the same time so simple, that its general adoption is 
much to be desired. A small fee leads the church-officer to make 
the requisite inquiries at every funeral. The result is given into 
the kirk-session every Sabbath after sermon, and is then entered 
into a book. If there is any defect in the infoi-mation, the elder 
best acquainted with the relatives of the deceased makes farther 
inquiry, and reports to the succeeding meeting. 

In so far as the parish registers may be depended upon, the 
average births for the last seven years have been 151; marriages, 
51 ; deaths, 135. 

Antiquities. — The ruins of several religious houses are still to 
be traced in different parts of the parish. The walls of the church 
of Kirkbride, on the farm of Dunduff, are distinct, the surround- 
ing burying-ground is still used, and an adjoining field bears the 
name of the Priest's Land. At Auchendrane and elsewhere, 
the radera of similar erections were visible when Abercrum- 
mie wrote his Journal. Kirkbride has generally been consider- 
ed as a par ish united to Maybole, but, being unable to find 
any notice of the union, I am rather inclined to think that it and 
the other ruins referred to were chapels attached to the collegiate 
church of Maybole. This last was an establishment of consider- 
able importance, and had a rector and three prebends. It was 
endowed out of the provost and priest's lands in the parish of Kirk- 
michael, which fell into the hands of the Earl of Cassilis, upon 
the dissolution of the college at the Reformation. The Black 
House and Well Trees still remain of the residences of the priests, 
and the orchards that surrounded the others are well known. The 
collegiate church is used as a burying-place by the family of Cas- 
• .silis,°and others who formerly contributed to its repair. It was, 
jievertheless, allowed to fall into a most ruinous and filtliy condi- 
tion, from which it was only rescued by the public spirit of Mr 
Andrews, and the inhabitants of Maybole, who a few years ago. 



MAYBOLE.

by subscription, surrounded it with a wall, and tastefully laid out 
and planted the enclosure. 

There are throughout the parish the remains of a great many 
castles, the ancient seats of those feudal chiefs who figure in the 
history of the Kennedys, and in the civil broils of the times. Be- 
sides the Castle of Maybole, the former residence of the Earls of 
Cassilis, and the principal part of which is still in excellent pre- 
servation, there are, more or less entire, the Castles of Newarli, 
Greenan, DundufF, Dunure, and Kilhenzie ; while those of Bridg- 
end or Doonside, Smithstowne, Sauchrie, Craigskean, Beoch, 
Garryhornie, Glenayes, Brochlock, and Daldutf, are only to be 
traced in a few ruinous walls. 

There are also within the town of Maybole several remains of 
its former consequence and splendour, when, as the provincial ca- 
pital it was resorted to in winter by many of the principal families 
in Carrick. Besides the dwellings of the ecclesiastics and the 
Earl of Cassilis, commonly designated in these days the King of 
Carrick, the following houses of the gentry still remain ; the pre- 
sent tolbooth, the town residence of the Lairds of Blairquhan ; 
the house of Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean, now belonging 
to Mr Niven of Kirkbride ; the house of Kennedy of Ballemore, 
in the Kirk Wynd ; the Garden of Eden, the house of the abbots 
of Crossraguel, &amp;c. extending, according to some, to the number 
of twenty-eight. 

The civil jurisdiction of Carrick was a bailliarie, belonging he- 
ritably to the Earls of Cassilis ; and Maybole derived an additional 
degree of consequence fromi being the ordinary seat of the courts 
of justice, when the most important cases were tried, and the pu- 
nishment of death frequently inflicted. The Gallow Hill still points 
out the place of execution ; and there are people alive who re- 
member those who could tell as a tale of their youth, the history 
of criminals whom they saw suffer. 

On an eminence, over the farm of Trees, there is a very distinct 
encampment ; and traces of similar enclosures, by mounds of earth, 
are visible in other places, and more particularly near the Castle 
of Dunduff. It is common to designate them as Roman Camps ; 
but they appear of far too inconsiderable dimensions to be con- 
nected with the history of that grfeat people, and are far more like- 
ly the remains of small forts erected by the Irish, who frequently 
overran the country, and many of which, of the very same form 
and construction, are still found in Ireland. 



36G 



AYRSHIRE. 



That the Romans traversed the parish there can, however, be no 
doubt. The great road passes through the parishes of Dalrymple 
and Ayr, at no great distance ; and a spear head of bronze, shaped 
Uke a saddler's knife, and made by incurvated edges to fit upon a 
shaft, dug up in the farm of Drumbeg, and a small image of the 
same metal representing justice with her equal weights, found in 
the farm of Drumshang, and now both in my possession, attest 
their presence, in the monuments they furnish of their wars and their 
superstition. 

Near the Castle of Dunduff, a coin of Albert and Elizabeth of 
Bruges and Brabant, about the size of a crown piece, was lately 
turned up by the plough. It bears no date, but as they reigned 
about 1630, its existence in that locality may readily be accounted 
for in many ways. It was then common for Scotsmen to enlist in 
the service of the low countries, and it may have been part of the 
earnings of years of hardship, brought back to his native spot by 
some veteran soldier. Smuggling was also extensively carried on, 
and it was not uncommon also to pay soldiers serving in the coun- 
try in foreign money. Tumuli containing bones, of which there is 
a good specimen on the farm of St Murrays, are common. 

Abercrummie mentions many remains of Catholic superstition, 
which are now almost forgotten. St Helen's Well, to the north of 
Baloch Mount, was long famous for the cure of unthriving children, 
at the change of the quarter, and more particularly at May-day, and 
was greatly resorted to even at a recent date. Pennygleu's Cross 
Well, also enjoyed great reputation for the cure of cows " taken 
with mure-ill," and was carried even to great distances, as " by 
drinking thereof, they are healed." 

Modern Buildings. — The church is a plain structure, with a 
steeple in the worst possible taste. By a recent repair the in- 
terior has been rendered comfortable and neat. There is no 
other building worthy of notice, but it may still be consolatory to 
observe, that, notwithstanding the decline which this would indi- 
cate from the former grandeur of Maybole, there is not one of the 
ancient houses of the gentry referred to, which is not far surpassed 
in accommodation and comfort by the houses of the respectable in- 
habitants of the present day. 

III. PorULATION. 

Ancient State.— The ancient state of the population of this pa- 
rish must have been liable to much disturbance and fluctuation. 
In common with other parts of Carrick, it was traversed by the Ro- 

i 



MAYBOLE. 



307 



ii}ms, who conquered the aborigines. It was then successively 
overrun by the Northumbrians, the Scots, and the Irish. It was 
afterwards infested by the Danes and Norwegians, and by the 
English during the struggles of Wallace aiid Bruce. The feuds of' 
hostile chieftains, the struggles of the Reformation, and the defence 
of presbytery against the persecutions of the house of Stuart, suc- 
ceeded ; and in 1676 particularly, there appears to have been a 
fearful loss of life. Yet, notwithstanding all these causes of dis- 
turbance, there are traces of a considerable population from very 
remote times, in the ruins, cairns, and marks of culture, which are 
found in every part of the parish. In the palmy days of Popery, 
the town must have had a considerable population, from the large 
ecclesiastical establishment of the Collegiate Church, with all its 
officers and dependents, as well as from the residence of the gen- 
try referred to under the head of Civil History. After the Refor- 
mation, and the great changes in the state of society consequent 
upon it, there appears to have been a decrease of the population 
from that period to the close of the last century. From that time 
to the present, the numbers have increased both in the town and 
country ; in the former they ha°ve been doubled, amounting now, 
from the influx of Irish weavers, to 4000 ; while in the country the 
spirit of agricultural improvement has also caused an increase, and 
where the population is between 2000 and 3000. There are none 
of the nobility or large proprietors who reside within the bounds of 
the parish. Their mansion-houses are for the most part in the 
neighbouring parishes; those that are within it are empty or let; 
and there are only five proprietors of land of the value of L. 50  
and upwards, actually resident. 

The peasantry may be generally stated to be of athletic and ac- 
tive habits, decidedly intelligent and moral, attached, with a very 
few exceptions, to the Established Church, and possessed in con- 
sequence of that steady and rational piety, which even in periods of 
great excitement has kept them in peace, and rendered voluntary- 
ism itself unknown, or altogether uninteresting in this district. 
They speak the expressive language of Burns, are well clothed, and, 
upon the whole, keep their cottages in a cleanly state, although it is 
to be lamented that many should still be so deficient in this respect. 

There are 4 deaf and dumb persons, 2 or 3 fatuous, and about 
the same number occasionally insane, but there has not been for 
many years any one in a state to require constant confinement in 
an asylum.

AYRSIimE. 



Smuo-o-lin'v had at one time made considerable encroachment on 
the morals of the people, but it has now for many years been almost 
totally abandoned, and beyond a few casks of Arran water from the 
opposite shores, and a little soap from Ireland, is unknown. 

The country people upon the whole enjoy the ordinary comforts 
of life, and are contented in their circumstances. The popula- 
tion in the town is in many respects very different. The intro- 
duction of manufactures has raised many in the scale of affluence 
and comfort, but it has led many of the operatives into habits of 
dissipation, and the Irish in particular, although there are ho- 
nourable exceptions, are but too generally drunken and filthy in 
their persons and houses. There are a great many poachers. The 
number of public-houses is a reproach to all concerned in main- 
taining them, and pawnbroking, their invariable attendant, has 
increased to an alarming extent, and threatens, with the spirit-shop, 
the ruin of the poorer classes. 

The number residing in the town by a census lately taken by 
the kirk-session is very nearly 4000. There are no villages of 
any consequence, and the rest of the population, amounting to 
about 2400, are distributed over tlie different farms. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The extent, variety of surface, and great recent 
improvements, combine to render this parish highly important as 
an agricultural district. 

The total number of acres, as taken from the returns made by 
the different farmers, is, 

Total imperial acres, - - 20,GBl 

Of these arable, - - 16,68-1 

Under plantation, - - 943 

Hill pasture and moorland, - 2490 

Meadow - 564 

™ ' 20,631 

The arable land consists, partly of a light soil, which produces 
excellent crops of potatoes, turnips and oats ; and partly of a 
strong clay soil, which yields upon being thoroughly drained heavy 
crops of wheat. 

The hill pasture and moorland occur chiefly on the summits 
and declivities of the Brown Carrick range of hills, and recent ex- 
periments have shewn, that even much of these might be profit- 
ably improved, more especially with a view to superior permanent 
pasture. The farmers occupying them are generally men of in- 
telligence and enterprise, and have all done more or less in this 
species of improvement. The efforts of the late Mr M'Jnnet 

4 



MAYBOLE. 



369 



of Drumshang, are of sufficient magnitude and importance to 
entitle them to a particular notice. The farm of Drumshang 
consists of upwards of 1000 imperial acres, 600 of which are, or 
rather were, in the state of moor, and the scanty herbage found 
among the heather that covered the greater part of it, may be 
inferred from the fact of the whole being valued at from 3s. to 4s. 
per acre. The tract selected by Mr M'Janet for his experiments 
was a part of this, lying on trap rock, and about 750 feet above 
the level of the sea. Little drainage was required, and he there- 
fore commenced his operations by stripping off the surface, burn- 
ing it, and then spreading the ashes over the soil. He afterwards 
laid upon it 20 bushels of bone-dust per acre, and in the usual 
way prepared it for, and sowed it with, turnips. They proved a 
full and excellent crop, and were consumed entirely on the ground 
with sheep. The next season he sowed the whole with oats and 
barley with grass-seeds. The oats were an abundant crop, ave- 
raging seven quarters per acre; the barley was rather light, yield- 
ing only about four quarters. The grass over the whole came up 
thick and fine, and is now in pasture, which is considered well worth 
L. 1 per acre. The tract thus reclaimed was considerably above 
100 acres, and the whole being done in two years, the Highland 
Society conferred on Mr M'Janet their gold medal, for the 
greatest extent of waste land in Scotland brought into cultivation 
within the shortest time. The expenses attendant on such ope- 
rations, appear, however, too great to be borne by the tenant, and 
the poor return for agricultural produce, threatens to arrest the 
speed of the plough, and to diminish rather than increase the 
amount of cultivated land. 

In such circumstances, too, an immediate increase of produce be- 
comes essential to the farmer, and instead of looking to the tardy 
returns of reclaimed waste, he is led to apply his capital to the 
more perfect improvement of his arable land by furrow-draining. 
This process is very expensive also, costing when done, either 
with stones or tiles, from L. 5 to L. 7 per acre. But landlords 
seem peculiarly disposed to aid their tenants in this great and per- 
manent improvement, either by advancing the whole capital re- 
quired, and charging a per centage of additional rent, or by con- 
tributing a proportion of the expetise, and leaving the farmer the 
whole benefit during the remainder of his lease. From all I have 
seen and heard both from landlords and tenants, I consider fur- 
row-draining upon clayey and retentive soils as the grand improve-

ment in recent agriculture, and which promises, above all other 
things, to compensate for lowness of price by increase of produce. 

The actual rental of the parish amounts to nearly L. 19,000, 
making the average rent per acre between 18s. and 19s. Leases 
are of nineteen years length. With the exception of a few farms, 
ranging from 200 to 1000 acres, where the farm-houses are com- 
modious and comfortable, and the offices substantial and exten- 
sive, the greater number of the farms are small, many from only 
40 to 1 00 acres ; and these, which are generally cultivated by the 
farmer and his family, who work hard and live plainly, have, witli 
few exceptions, very poor accommodations, both in dwelling-houses 
and offices. 

Gross Amount of Raio Produce. — It is extremely difficult to get 
accurate returns under this head ; but the following results are 
taken from reports procured from each of the farmers, and are, 
I have no doubt, near to the truth. The prices were calculated at 
about the average of the last three years. 

Wheat, - L. 10,510 

Oats, - 9946 

Beans, - 1392 

Barley, - 219 

Potatoes, - 6257 

Turnips, - 5202 

Cultivated hay, - 4013 

Meadow hay, - 363 

Pasture, 9100 

L. 47,20-2 

There are besides small quantities of beet ; about L. 300 per 
annum for orchards and garden ground ; about L. 50 per annum 
for wood. 

There is a salmon fishery at the mouth of the Doon, of which 
a notice will be found in the account of the parish of Ayr. 

At Dunure there is also a small sea-fishing estabhshment, but 
with respect to the fish taken there, and their appearances on our 
coasts, I have also to refer to the account of the parish of Ayr. 

Live-Stock.r-The breed of cattle is almost exclusively the Ayr- 
shire, which has attained so much celebrity for the purposes of the 
dairy, and which seems also well adapted for the butcher-market. An 
attempt has been recently made to introduce the short-horned breed 
for the latter purpose, and I have seen very fine anmials of that spe- 
cies, and also of the cross between it and the Ayrshire, and whicU 
both attained to a much greater weight than the native cattle ever 
reach. On inquirv, however, I found that such had uniformly re- 
qiired a great deal of extra feeding, and I have little doubt tliat 



TVIAYBOLE. 



the generality of our farmers will have as much weight of beef, at 
a much less amount of expense, at the end of the year, from the 
feeding of the Ayrshire cattle, which seem in every respect best 
fitted to the nature and powers of the soil. 

The sheep fed in the parish, which are comparatively few in 
number, are chiefly of the black-faced and Cheviot breeds, although, 
on some of the best farms, the Leicester breed have also been in- 
troduced. 

Manufactures. — There are no manufacturing establishments of any 
consequence in the parish ; but, as has invariably happened on the 
west coast, the influences of Glasgow and the proximity of Ireland, 
have drawn to the town and every little hamlet a great population 
of hand-loom weavers. These are all employed by the manufac- 
turers of Glasgow through the medium of a class of middle-men, 
called agents, and who, from the improvidence of the weavers, who 
are mostly Irish, and their practice of keeping shops and paying 
them in kind, are generally very prosperous. This system is in 
many respects calculated to depress the condition of the operative. 
He applies for goods to the agent, and gets into debt. He must 
then purchase at the agent's own priccj and is generally in pover- 
ty. Yet, on the other hand, the extreme improvidence of the Irish 
renders them little capable of being entrusted with money ; their 
wages might all be expended on whisky ; and when the agents do 
not in any part pay them in it, a practice that cannot be too se- 
verely reprobated, the plan of giving articles of food and clothing 
instead of cash, is perhaps conducive to the welfare of their fami- 
lies. The transaction is, indeed, an infringement of the law of 
the land, and on this account some of the agents pay their weavers 
in money, but the truck system is easily followed by a shopkeeper 
without any direct violation of the statute for its prevention. It is 
very common for women to weave. Boys are put at an early age to 
the loom, and the hours of working are, more especially in times 
of depression, very long. I have known the weaver to labour, with 
little intermission, fourteen and sixteen hours a-day, and after all 
earn but the miserable pittance of 6s. or 7s. per week, a sum bare- 
ly adequate to support his family in the meanest way ; but at pre- 
sent a most favourable change has occurred, and every one, even 
with moderate exertion, may command all the comforts of life. It 
is, however, melancholy to observe how very often men frustrate 
by their vices the kindness of Providence. With prosperity, habits 
of idleness and drinking, which had been checked, have returned, 



372 



AYRSHIRE. 



and the sounds of riot are again heard in our streets, protracted on 
the morning of the Sabbath even till a late hour. 

The effects produced by this influx of a large manufacturing po- 
pulation will be very differently viewed, according to the different 
ways in which we may estimate the prosperity of a community. If, 
in the utilitarian spirit of the times, we look upon wealth as the 
great ingredient of that prosperity, we must no doubt regard this 
influx as an unmingled good. Every week brings from Glasgow, at 
the present time, in payment for work, from L. 500 to L. 700, every 
farthing of which is immediately expended, and this has unques- 
tionably had the effect, not only of enriching our shopkeepers, but 
also of producing a demand for agricultural produce, which has be- 
nefited the farmers, and raised the value of land in every part of 
the parish. But if, on the other hand, we regard wealth as a very 
secondary object, and view all human events, as good or evil, ac- 
cording to their bearing on moral and religious character, we must 
make great deductions from the foregoing estimate of its advan- 
tages. The great proportion of the population in question are dis- 
solute in their habits ; few of them attend any place of worship ; 
they spend the Sabbath in wandering over the fields and on the 
sea shore, and desecrate the day by their irregularities. Our na- 
tive population have no doubt kept themselves very much apart from 
their society, — a circumstance which, if it has tended on the one 
hand, to perpetuate their ignorance and immorality, has, on the 
other hand, counteracted in a considerable degree the contamina- 
tion of their example. 

Considerable exertions, however, have lately been made to ad- 
vance, more especially the young among them, in knowledge and 
religion ; and it is hoped that they may ere long occupy a higher 
status in the community. 

Agricultural Association.— There was instituted in the year 1797 
an association for the improvement of agriculture, which holds its 
meetings at May bole, and the beneficial influences of which are to 
be observed in the good farming and excellent stock of the sur- 
rounding district. It is called the Carrick Farmers' Society, and 
numbers among its members the nobility and gentry, the great pro- 

• Since writing the .-ibove, a striking proof of tlic fluctuating nature of manufac- 
tures has been afforded. The supply of webs from Glasgow has been greatly curtail- 
cd, and prices lowered. Many of the weavers have been thrown ullo, and reduced to 
a state of starvation. What they call a dull has set in, and ihe heritors and inhabi- 
tants of the parish have had to come forward for their relief. Ihe statement in the 
subsequent paragraph referred to tiie state of things two or three months ago.

portion of the respectable farmers, and several of the clergy of this 
division of the county. Four regular meetings are held in the year, 
and there are commonly two exhibitions of stock of different kinds, 
when premiums, voted by the society, and two pieces of plate, an- 
nually given by the Marquis of Ailsa and Sir James Fergusson of 
Kilkerran, are competed for. The Society also awards premiums 
for the best management of green crops, and the neatest operations 
in ploughing and other field labour. Essays on subjects connect- 
ed with agricultural improvements are read and discussed at the 
meetings, and a grant is annually made from the funds for the pur- 
chase of books, models, or new implements of husbandry. Assist- 
ance is also given to members who may have fallen into poverty, 
and to the families of such as may have been left in that condition. 
Its affairs are altogether most judiciously managed ; its meetings in 
every respect most beneficial ; and, notwithstanding the liberal 
sums given every year for the various purposes referred to, there is 
at present a capital of L. 575. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion. — Maybole is a market-town. The market is 
held on Thursday, and is limited to the sale of butter, eggs, and a 
few of the minor articles ofcountry produce. The grain raised in 
the parish is generally taken to the town of Ayr, about nine miles 
distant. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office in Maybole, 
The length of turnpike roads is 28 miles 6 fur. 0 poles, 8 yds. 
A mail-coach passes daily through the town, to and from Glas- 
gow, and Port- Patrick. Two stage-coaches run twice in the week 
to and from Ayr. The fences of dry-stone dikes, or more 
generally of thorn and beech hedges, are in good order, and 
bridges, embankments, and all connected with the public roads, 
are in the best condition. 

There is a small harbour at Dunure, where there are a few 
fishing-boats, and where lime and bone-dust are frequently landed 
in vessels, freighted by the farmers from Ireland, but it is getting 
fast into a state of dilapidation, and if not soon repaired will be- 
come utterly useless. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situate at the east 
entrance to the town, and though extremely convenient for its in- 
habitants, and those of the southern and adjacent parts of the 
country parish, is still very far removed from many localities to- 
wards the east and north, and more especially from the whole of

AYRSHIUE. 



the country on the western and northern parts of Brown Carrick- 
hill, many places there being from five to nine miles distant by 
the road. It was built in 1808, and the last repair by which the 
interior was much improved, was made in 1830. It accommodates 
from 1200 to 1300. Twelve sittings only, and these in corners 
and passages, are free and set apart for the poor. The manse was 
built in 1806. It is small, and in the usual style of manse archi- 
tecture, but it has been substantially built, and has not hitherto re- 
quired any expensive repairs. The glebe consists of about nine 
Scots acres, and is worth L. 30 per annum. The stipend is 20 
chalders of victual, half meal and half barley, with an allowance 
of L,20 for communion elements. 

There are as yet no chapels, but a preaching station has of late 
been estabhshed in the shore district, which is so far distant from 
the parish church ; and it is hoped that a church will soon be 
erected and endowed in that quarter. An additional church for 
the accommodation of the weaving population in the town is also 
much required. There is a chapel belonging to the United Se- 
cession body in the town, the minister of which, the Rev. Mr 
Thomson, receives a stipend of about L, 100 per annum, a very 
inadequate remuneration for his worth and services. There is also a 
small chapel in connection with the Methodists, but no regular 
minister, and the Irish Catholics and Episcopalians have the oc- 
casional services of the ministers of these persuasions in Ayr. 

Taking the population at 6362, there are belonging to the Es- 
tablished Church 5033, and of the 1329 belonging to other de- 
nominations, the following is the distribution : United Secession, 
548; Roman Catholic, 355 ; Church of England, 214; Metho- 
dist, 104; Relief, 54; Reformed Presbytery, 44; Antiburgher, 
10. 

Divine service at the Established Church is generally well at- 
tended, and the average number of communicants is 1300. 

There is a society, named the Maybole Association, for religious 
purposes, supported chiefly by collections, made from time to time 
in the parish church and Secession meeting-house, and the most 
o-eneral application of the funds has been in donations to the Ayr 
and Edinburgh Bible Societies, from both of which most liberal 
supplies of Bibles and Testaments have been received for distri- 
bution among the poor. 

Collections for other claims, such as the Assembly's Missions, 
Church Extension, Education, and for purposes of local chanty, are 

1 



MAYBOLE. 375 

  

made at convenient intervals at the church door, and may alto- 
gether amount to about L. 40 per annum. 

A tract society has been in vigorous operation for nearly tvo 
years, and its publications, which have always been favourably re- 
ceived, promise to be useful to the community. 

I must here notice an association, not strictly parochial, but con- 
nected in the same manner with all the parishes in Carrick, the 
Carrick Class, composed of the clergy of the district, and the duty 
of giving some account of which has been assigned to me. This 
association has existed since the establishment of Presbytery in 
Scotland. The meetings of the clergy upon church matters ap- 
pear successively to have been called congregations and classes, 
before they were regularly constituted into presbyteries : and the 
Carrick Class, though it has frequently been proposed, having never 
been erected into a presbytery, has yet retained the old name, and 
kept up its meetings, with occasional periods of interruption, down 
to the present day. 

Our proceedings have of course lost their business character, al- 
though something of the original purposes of the meeting may 
sometimes be discerned, in the members asking advice in difficul- 
ties, taking into their own hands business more immediately con- 
nected with the district, and even occasionally arranging little 
matters, which, when afterwards brought out in the presbytery, 
will draw forth a good humoured notice of our clannish propensi- 
ties, and attempts at establishing, if not our original independence, 
at least an " imperium in imperio." 

The great purposes of our meeting, however, are the mainte- 
nance and promotion of literary and professional attainments, good 
fellowship, and Christian harmony. With the exception of the 
months in which the sacrament is dispensed in the different pa- 
rishes, the members, according to a fixed rotation, meet in each 
other's manses, on the second Tuesday of every alternate month, 
at one o'clock p. m. The minister in whose manse the meeting 
is held, opens it with prayer, and reads an essay on any literary, 
theological or ecclesiastical subject, which his own taste may have 
led him to choose. The members, according to seniority, then 
express their opinion of the essay, and their own views of the 
points treated of ; and after any reply which the author may make, 
the meeting is closed with prayer, agreeably to the same rotation. 
The afternoon is spent with the family in social enjoyment, and 
members from a distance generally remain all night. 



376

That these meetings accomplish some, or perhaps the most, 
important of these purposes, the kindly relations, unbroken by 
differences of party, in which the Carrick brethren have long 
lived, afford a most pleasing proof. Nor have they been abor- 
tive in a literary and professional view. Dr Macknight, for- 
merly alluded to as minister of Maybole, read the substance 
both of his Harmony and Truth of the Gospel histories as 
essays in the class, before sending them to the press ; and with- 
out presuming to say any thing directly of the present members, 
one of whom at least is well known to the church by his high 
character and useful publications ; the following list of subjects 
lately treated of will show, that they have not laid aside, amid 
their more sacred duties, those literary tastes and habits of study, 
which never fail to give additional influence to the clerical cha- 
racter : On the Interpretation of the Apocalypse, one of a Series, 
by Mr Inglis, of Kirkoswald ; Critical examination of the latter 
part of the 7th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, by Dr Hill 
of Dailly ; Critical essay on the 19th verse of the 3d chapter of 
1st Peter, by Mr Blair of Colmonell; On what has been denomi- 
nated the Golden Era of the Church, or Second Reformation, by 
Mr Wallace of Barr ; On the Etymology, and Scripture use of 
the Hebrew word DNlfjX by Mr Gray of Maybole ; On the pro- 
posal for a new form of Process, and the introduction of Trial by 
Jury into the Church Courts, by Mr Paton of Straiton ; On the 
Deluge, by Mr Wallace of Dalrymple ; Whether the Election of 
Ministers by the People is a right founded on Scripture, by Mr 
Milroy of Ballantrae ; Outline of an argument for the Truth and 
Reasonableness of the peculiar doctrines of Christianity, by Mr 
Houston of Dalmellington ; On the authorship and original lan- 
guage of the Epistle to the Hebrews, Mr M'Ewen of Kirkmichael. 

Education. — Total number of schools in the parish, 13; of paro- 
chial, 1 ; supported by subscription, 1 ; free school-room, 2 ; un- 
endowed in any way, 9. English reading and grammar, writing and 
arithmetic, are taught in all the schools ; and in the parochial and 
three of the others, Latin, Greek, French, and geography. 

The parochial schoolmaster, at present Mr John Inglis, preacher 
of the Gospel, has the maximum salary ; an allowance of L. 30 per 
annum for house rent, and L. 5 for school prizes, and the average 
amount of fees is L. 100. 

There is a general anxiety for the education of the young 
throughout the parish ; and since the establishment of the sub-

scription school for the poorer classes in the town, which has been 
very ably conducted by Mr Lennox, a greater desire for the in- 
struction of their children has sprung up among the Irish popu- 
lation, which promises to be attended with the happiest results. 

Literature. — There are subscription and circulating libraries in 
the town, and in the villages of Dunure and Calroy ; and the 
parish school and Sabbath evening schools have small libraries 
attached to them. 

Charitable and other Institutions — Friendly Societies. The 
following list will show that a number of these important societies 
still exist; many have been dissolved, and several are rather in a 
declining state. They have been of the very greatest advantage, 
and have enabled many families to maintain their independence in 
seasons of distress ; and it is to be regretted that erroneous calcu- 
lations at the first, and too liberal application of the funds at par- 
ticular conjunctures, should have shaken their stability and im- 
paired their usefulness : — Love and Unity, instituted in 1796, has 
of capital, L. 54; Philanthropic, instituted in 1808, capital, L. 120; 
Caledonian, sixty-six members, instituted in 1818, capital, L. 140; 
Social and Humane, instituted in 1825, capital, L. 84; Albion, 
sixty-six members, instituted in 1820, capital, L. 83; Benevolent 
Love and Unity Female, instituted in 1829; Friendly Female, 
instituted in 1810, capital, L. 25. 

Saving Banks. — There was instituted in 1831, a savings bank 
for Maybole and the adjacent villages, which has continued to 
prosper to the present date, but it is much to be regretted that so 
few, especially of the hand- loom weavers, should have availed them- 
selves of its provisions. The following summary furnished by 
Mr Brown, the banker, will show the progress and state of the 
institution.

tal, 273— having due to them at 1st January 1837, per state of 
account from bank, L. 1152, 14s. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about 70 ; and the average sum al- 
lotted to each per week about Is. 4d. 

The annual amount of contributions is about L. 230; L. 100 
of which is raised by the ordinary collection at the church door, 
and another L. 100 by a voluntary contribution from the heritors, 
who are generally non-resident, and who in the payment of this 
sum probably give less than they would do, in the course of a re- 
gular attendance at church. The remaining L. 30 is made up of 
proclamation fees, collections at marriages, and private batisms. 

If the general non-residence of the heritors, and the extent and 
condition of the population be considered, there can be no doubt 
that the poor in this parish are supported at as small an expense 
as in any other parish similarly situated. But it must not be con- 
cealed, that though among the native population there are a great 
many who would starve rather than ask charity, this does not re- 
sult from any general reluctance on the part of the poorer classes, 
especially among the Irish, to ask for parochial relief, but because 
they find in begging a more productive and agreeable mode of 
support, than in the pittance given by the kirk-session. I am 
quite sure that the fund publicly distributed bears a small propor - 
tion to what is given every year by the inhabitants of the town and 
country at their doors. Many fine things have been written in fa- 
vour of this mode of management, and it no doubt has its advan- 
tages ; but the extensive training to habits of public begging which 
it involves, cannot be estimated as a trifling drawback, when all

the demoraUzing con'sequences of that practice, particularly among 
the young, are taken into account. 

Prisons. — There is a prison attached to the town-hall, used 
chiefly as a lock-up house, till offenders are sent to the Ayr gaol. 

Fairs. — There are four held annually, the Candlemas Bel- 
tane, Lammas, and Hallow fairs, originally instituted for diflFerent 
purposes- of merchandise, but now almost entirely hmited to the 
hiring of servants. 

Inns, 4 c. — There are 50 inns and ale-houses in the parish, 
between 30 and 40 of which are in the town, and the others 
in the country, — a number far beyond what is required for legiti- 
mate purposes, and most prejudicial to the morals of the people. 

Fuel. — -The fuel almost exclusively used is coal. The town 
and southern districts of the parish are generally supplied from the 
Girvan water-pits at Dalzellowby and Dalquharn, four and five 
miles distant, while the northern part is more frequently supplied 
from the Ayr water coal-field. The coal from the Girvan water 
is sold at from 7s. 6d. to 10s. per ton delivered. That from the 
Ayr field generally costs a little more, but is much superior in 
quality. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

The changes in the state of this parish since the publication of 
the last Statistical Acount are numerous and striking. 

It is little more than thirty years since wheat began to be par- 
tially cultivated ; it has only been generally raised within the last 
twenty years, and it now constitutes the chief and most valuable pro- 
duce of the land, and has been grown of a weight and quality equal 
to that of the Lothians. 

Within the last forty years, there was scarcely a hedge, the 
greater part of the land was in pasture, and the only crops were 
oats, bear, and a few peas and beans. The fields are now well 
enclosed and drained, and bear abundantly all kinds of agricul- 
tural produce. 

About that period, too, the cattle were of the Galloway breed, 
which have now been superseded by the Ayrshire, and which are 
found in as great perfection, both as to weight and symmetry, as in 
any other parish in the county. • The cow painted by Mr Shiels 
for the Edinburgh University Agricultural Museum is in the stock 
of Mr Finlay of Lionston, in the immediate vicinity of the town. 

Some very curious details, illustrative of the progress of im- 
provement, were furnished by an inquiry lately made, for a legal

purpose, into the former and present condition of an estate on the 
sea shore. Before the year 1780, there was not a fence beyond 
that of a low turf wall upon the whole property, and the houses 
were mere huts, thatched, and generally with gabels built of turf. 
The whole is now divided and enclosed, and the farm-houses and 
steadings are commodious, slated, and even handsome in their ap- 
pearance. But the following state of the rental, at the different 
dates referred to, affords the most striking proof of the change 
which has taken place. From the original document, it appears 
that the rent, at the earlier dates, consisted of so many pounds 
Scots, with small quantities of bear and meal, and a quantity of 
poultry ; but the value of the whole, calculated at the prices of 
the times, is here given in Sterling money.

The town of Maybole has also of late years been much im- 
proved. Access to it was formerly inconvenient and difficult, but, 
by the exertions of Mr Niven of Kirkbride, who has always taken 
the greatest interest in the improvement of his native place, the 
streets have been opened by spacious roads to and from all quar- 
ters. The tradesmen are highly respectable ; the merchants are 
men of substance and intelligence ; and many of the shops are 
handsome and well stocked with every article of provisions and 
dress required by the town and neighbouring country. 

The change from a purely agricultural to a manufacturing po- 
pulation has, too, produced great alterations, some of the perni- 
cious effects of which have been elsewhere adverted to ; but we 
cannot doubt that, with proper means of improvement, the whole 
might finally be rendered matter of congratulation. Let the civil 
magistrate be vigilant in repressing crime ; — let him reduce to a 
moderate number the houses of public entertainment, and rigidly 
enforce good hours and orderly demeanour, more especially on the 
Sabbath day ; — let the ecclesiastical establishments be so adapted 
to the increased numbers, that the means of religious instruction 
and pastoral superintendence be provided for all ; — and let edu- 
cation, under the directing care of the Church, be proportionally 
extended, and there can be no question that the ignorant and ir- 
religious located amongst us will be raised in the moral scale, and 
be succeeded at least by a better generation.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER HILL, D. D. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name given to this parish, Daly or Dailly, has 
probably arisen from its consisting principally of a dale or valley 
stretching along the banks of the river Girvan. 

Extent, Sfc. — From north-east to south-west, the parish extends 
in the line of the river about 7 miles. It varies in breadth from 4 
to 6 miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The figure of the parish is an ir- 
regular oblong. It is bounded on the west and south-west by the 
parish of Girvan ; on the south by the parish of Barr, a great part 
of which, prior to 1650, belonged to the parish of Dailly; on the 
east by the parishes of Straiton and Kirkmichael ; and on the north- 
east and north by the parish of Kirkoswald. It lies nearly in the 
centre of Carrick, one of the three districts of Ayrshire. 

The hills on both sides of the valley are of very moderate height. 
There is much natural beauty in every part of it, from the wind- 
ing of the river, and the variety of the ground ; and its natural 
beauty has been greatly heightened by the improvements of mo- 
dern times. 

Although the extremity of this parish is nearly two miles distant 
from the sea coast, yet the Island of Ailsa, about fifteen miles west 
from the town of Girvan, is considered as belonging to Dailly, be- 
ing included in the barony of Knockgerran, a part of the Marquis 
of Ailsa's property, which hes in this parish. It is a huge rock, 
perhaps two miles in circumference at the base, and about 1100 
feet above the level of the sea. Seen from the south or north its 
shape is very much that of a cone. Its appearance from the east 
is more flattened. It is precipitous on all sides, and is accessible 
only on the north-east, where there is a small beach. The cliffs 
in several places are columnar. A considerable way up the rock 
are remains of buildings, supposed to have been a tower or castle,

and a chapel. Very fine water is found on the rock, and near its 
summit. There is little pasture on it. Numberless flocks of birds 
frequent it, and particularly gannets or solan geese. It is chiefly 
from their feathers that the rent of the island is derived ; and it is 
only during the time that the birds are sought for on account of 
their feathers, that any one resides upon it. There was recently 
a plan in agitation for making Ailsa a fishing-station, for the sup- 
ply of Glasgow and Liverpool, by means of the steam-boats which 
pass it regularly. Some buildings were commenced for the pur- 
pose, but the plan has not been carried into effect. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The parish abounds in some of the 
most useful minerals, as coal, limestone, and sandstone freestone. 

The form or shape of the coal-field is that of a long elliptical 
basin, extending about six miles in a north-east and south-west 
line of bearing through the parish. Its breadth is about 600 yards. 
Eminent engineers consider it as forming part of the great coal 
field which stretches across the island from the neighbourhood of 
Edinburgh, in a south-westerly direction, into Ayrshire. The coal- 
field here consists of five workable seams of coal, varying in thick- 
ness from four to fourteen feet, and cropping out to the surface on 
both sides of the basin, at right angles to the line of bearing, with 
different declivities, from forty-five degrees, from one in one to one 
in three. The seams are all of good quality, but are subject to various 
dislocations, ashitches, slips, and are traversed by greenstone or whin- 
stone dikes, &amp;c. The roofs are generally good, either shale, fire-clay, 
or hard sandstone. The coal is worked to considerable extent on the 
estates of Bargany and Dalquharran. Steam-engines have been em- 
ployed at both collieries for a number of years. The sales are prin- 
cipally for home consumption ; but coals are also shipped from these 
collieries to Ireland and elsewhere. The gas which is used at Ayr 
is obtained from the Dalquharran parrot coal. The sales may 
amount annually to 20,000 tons. The cost of a ton at the pit head 
is about 4s. 8d. or 5s. A ton weighs 24 cwt., and there are eight 
creels in a ton. It is singular that no coal has as yet been disco- 
vered to the west or south of this parish. There are two lime-works 
in the parish ; the one near the north-west extremity at Craighead, 
on the estate of Bargany; the other near the south-east extremity, 
at Blairhill, on the estate of Kilkerran. Craighead is a vast un- 
broken mass of limestone, the dimensions of which are imperfectly 
known. Blairhill is a regularly stratified rock, lying betwixt beds 
of hard sandstone, with a moderate declivity from the surface. The 



DAILLY. 



383 



annual sale from these lime-works is about 100,000 bolls, each 
boll containing two Winchester bushels. The price of a boll is 8d. 
Limestone has also been recently found by Mr Kennedy of Dunure 
on his estate of Dalquharran, and in connection with his coal ; but 
the idea of working it has been abandoned. 

Beds of freestone are very numerous and extensive. Some of 
them are uncommonly fine, and are much esteemed in ornamental 
building. This freestone was used in building the houses of Kil- 
kerran, and Dalquharran in this parish, and of Blairquhan in the 
parish of Straiten. The whitest and most durable freestone is 
found along the centre of the coal-basin, and often forms the im- 
mediate roof of the upper seam of coal. The most valuable quar- 
ries lie along the base of the hills south of the coal-basin, parti- 
cularly on the estate of Kilkerran. 

Calcareous marl also abounds on both sides of the coal-basin, 
and is found in regular strata. It was formerly much used as a 
manure, but the superiority of lime for this purpose, and its abun- 
dance in the neighbourhood, have led to the disuse of marl. 

Many small chalybeate springs, scattered over different parts of 
the parish, seem to indicafe the existence of extensive strata of 
ironstone. Such seams of ironstone as have been seen are 2ene- 
rally found at considerable depth, under the lowest seam of coal. 
Those that have been noticed in the roofs are thought to be 
rich, but, unless iron should rise to an enormous price, it is not 
considered that any advantage could accrue to the proprietor from 
working the ironstone. The coal in this parish is said to be par- 
ticularly adapted for making of iron. 

The principal ridge of hills on the south side of the valley ap- 
pears to consist chiefly of freestone, on which are piled up enor- 
mous masses of puddingstone. Those on the north side are pro- 
bably of a similar structure. On some of them are found exten- 
sive rocks of a basaltic nature in the rude and irregular form dis- 
tinguished by the name of trap. In none of these have mineral 
veins of any kind of metal been discovered. 

The nature of the soil is as various as the surface is diversified. 
Along the banks of the river the holms and meadows, in some 
places of considerable extent, are generally of alight but very fer- 
tile soil, and capable of the highest cultivation. On the south 
side, the soil rests on a bottom of gravel, and is peculiarly favour- 
able fo.r pasturage. On the north side, there is a larger admix- 
ture of clay -in both the soil and the inferior strata.

AYRSHIRE. 



Botany. — Much attention has been paid to horticulture, in both 
its useful and its ornamental branches. Extensive shrubberies 
round the residences of several of the proprietors, are connected 
by pleasure walks with the woods and glens with which the parish 
abounds. Arboriculture has also greatly advanced of late years. 
Planting has been carried to a considerable extent on the estates 
of Bargany, Kilkerran, Dalquharran, and Drumburle. On that 
of Bargany alone no less than 666 acres have been planted in the 
last thirty years. Timber of every kind congenial to the climate 
of Scotland thrives here luxuriantly, with the single exception of 
the Balm of Gilead fir. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-ovmers. — The land-owners of the parish are, Henrietta Dal- 
rymple Hamilton Duchesse de Coigny, proprietress of Bargany ; 
Sir James Fergusson, of Kilkerran, Bart. ; Sir John Andrew 
Cathcart, of Carleton, Bart. ; Thomas Francis Kennedy, of Dun- 
ure, Esq. ; Sir David Hunter Blair, Bart. ; the Marquis of Ailsa, 
and Spencer Boyd, of Penkill, Esq. The four proprietors first 
named have residences in the parish. There is also a mansion- 
house on the estate of Drumburle, belonging to Sir David Hun- 
ter Blair. At Kilkerran and Penkill there are ruins of castles 
which had been places of strength, particularly that at Kilkei-ran. 
They are both in very picturesque situations. 

Parochial Begister. — The parochial registers, and the records of 
the kirk-session, have been uniformly kept together. They oc- 
cupy seven volumes. The first volume includes the period from 
April 1691 to the year 1711, and is perfectly legible, but in some 
places much decayed. There is reason to believe that, during the 
early parts of the last century, the registers were not accurately 
kept. From the year 1751, every attention has been paid to them. 

Antiquities.— In regard to antiquities, this parish has little to 
boast of. At a place called Machry-kill, there was a small church 
or chapel, probably dedicated to St Macarius. Near the lower 
extremity of a wild and romantic dell, which adjoins to Kilkerran, 
and forms with its woods, rocks, and numerous cascades, a beau- 
tiful walk, there once stood a chapel dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary. From this circumstance, the dell still retains the name of 
the Lady Glen. At the western extremity of the ridge of hills on 
the south side of the parish, there are the remains of an encamp- 
ment, 100 yards in length by 65 in breadth. It is of aji oval 
form, and consists of two enclosures. The inner oneMs more en- 



DAILLY. 385 

tire than the outer. Neither of them extends the whole way 
round, the ground being particularly steep for about 50 yards on 
the face of the hill. The encampment commands a magnificent 
view, particularly of the Island of Arran ; and Turnberry Castle, in 
the parish of Kirkoswald, lies directly before it towards the north. 
It may therefore have been connected with the plans or move- 
ments of Robert Bruce. 

On the 5th July 1836, a day which will be long remembered 
for the length and the violence of the thunder storm which raged 
over all the lowlands of Scotland, the lightning struck upon this 
hill m two different places, not far from the encampment. The 
fissures which it made are somewhat zig-zag, deepeT at one extre- 
mity than any furrow of a plough, and extending about seven or eight 
yards. The ground below has the feeling of a collection of ashes. 
At Old Dailly, in a very sweet spot, are the ruins of the old parish 
church, which was left in 1696 for the more centrical situation 
which the church now occupies. 

Modern Bicildinffs.-The buildings in' the parish, besides those 
already mentioned, are two, flour-mills, which go by water, two 
saw-mills, under wooden erections at the two collieries, impelled 
by the steam-engines there, a third saw-mill, in a different quarter, 
driven by water, and a brick-work connected with the colliery at 
■Dalquharran.

The decrease of the population since the census in 1831 is pro- 
bably to be ascribed to the discontinuance of the extensive im- 
provements which were for some time carried on by the landed 
proprietors. Emigration has not prevailed much in this neigh- 
bourhood, but is upon the increase.

The whole parish is possessed by the seven landed proprietors 
already mentioned, and four of them reside in it, at least occasion- 
ally- 

Two blind girls belonging to this parish were for a number ot 
years in the Edinburgh Asyhun. They are able, by knitting, to 
gain a little for their own support. There is one lad deaf and 
dumb, who is very active and intelligent as a labourer, and who is 
scarcely ever absent from church. There is also one boy in an- 
other family, who is deaf and dumb. There are two fatuous 
persons. 

In the course of the last three years, the number of illegitimate 
births in the parish was 21. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— It is supposed that the parish contains above 
17,000 acres, and that 8000 or 9000 are either cultivated or occa- 
sionally in tillage. Out of the uncultivated portions, there are pro- 
bably not 200 acres to which the labour of cultivation could be pro- 
fitably applied. There is no part of the parish in a state of undi- 
vided common. It is computed that 2500 acres are under wood, 
natural or planted. 

The trees planted are generally oak, ash, plane, and elm, with 
such proportion of Scotch larch and spruce firs, as fills the ground 
for an early crop. The indigenous trees are chiefiy oak, ash, and 
birch The woods of the first and last are remarkably well pruned 
and thinned every year. The felUng of the Scotch and larch firs 
takes place at about fifteen years growth, to give room to the hard 
wood and spruce firs. 

Bent.—The average rent of arable land, per imperial acre, is 
about L. 1. The average rent for grazing a cow or ox, of three 
years old and upwards, is from L.2 to L.3; of two years old, 
L. 1, 10s. to L. 1, 15s. ; of one year old, L. 1 to L. 1, 5s. ; a evNC 
or full-grown sheep, 4s. There are three kinds of sheep common 
in the parish,-the black-faced or moor sheep, the Cheviot, and 
a cross between these breeds. The cattle are chiefly of the dairy 
or Ayrshire, with a portion of the Galloway breed. There are 
some crosses between the Ayrshire and the Teeswater. Consider- 
able attention is paid to the improvement of both sheep and cattle, 
by introducing superior kinds of the different breeds. Premiums 
for the best that have been reared have for some years been award- 
ed, by the Carrick Farmers' Society, and a new impulse has recent- 
ly been given to agriculturists in their attention to breeding, by the 



DAILLY. 



387 



visit of the Highland Society to Ayrshire in 1835, and the esta- 
blishment of numerous agricultural associations upon similar prin- 
ciples throughout the country. Generally speaking, the husbandry 
pursued is good. Wheat is much cultivated after a potatoe crop' 
•ass sown down with wheat is usually found to produce a light 
crop of hay, and in some instances has failed altogether. On large 
farms, turnips are in a great measure taking the place of potatoes. 
They seem to answer the soil and climate, and are an excellent 
preparation for barley, which, when sown down with grass seeds, is 
followed by a large crop of hay, with corresponding good pasture. 
Bone manure has been introduced of late for turnips, and is highly 
approved of. 

Since 1805, the state of husbandry has been greatly improved; 
and a considerable portion of waste or moor land lias been brought 
under cultivation, by inclosing and liming on the surface. Drain- 
ing has been carried to a great extent by both proprietors and 
tenants. The improvement by this means on the estate of Bargany 
is very remarkable. A large tract of hill pasture, which the pro- 
prietor held for some time in his own hand, was most.advantageous- 
ly subjected to the process first of surface-draining, and then of hm- 
ing. The lower grounds on the same property have all been power- 
fully drained, and in many places trenched, and being now laid down 
in grass with every possible attention, afford the richest and most beau- 
tiful pasture. Tile-draining, or furrow-draining, is considered as a 
most important improvement. Irrigation was introduced a few years 
ago at Dalquharran, by Mr Kennedy of Dunure, and it was' found 
to answer so well, that he has greatly enlarged his meadow. The 
same system has also been begun by Sir James Fergusson at Kil- 
kerran, and he has been followed in it by one of his principal ten- 
ants. Embanking on a pretty large scale has been practised by Sir 
James Fergusson, and particularly by Mr Kennedy of Dunure. To 
abridge the very winding course of the Girvan, and to prevent the 
inundations to which the low grounds on each side were frequent- 
ly subject, he caused a new channel to be cut for the river for the 
space of 210 yards; and raised on both sides a double embank- 
ment, the upper one being so far behind the lower, as to give 
ample room for the largest quantity of water which the Girvan, 
when most swollen, can be supposed to contain. Another very in- 
genious operation was carried on at the same time. Before the 
river was admitted into its new channel, pipes were laid under its 
bed, by which the ground on one side might be drained. That 



388 



AYRSHIRE. 



ground consisted of a large field of about forty acres, a great part of 
which was a deep morass. Little use could be made of it, as it was 
so much on a level with the river, that it was frequently overflow- 
ed, and could not be relieved of its superfluous water. By means 
of the pipes, this water was conveyed into a deep and extensive tun- 
nel, which empties its contents, collected from a variety of quarters, 
a considerable way lower down the viver. The work has been ad- 
mirably well executed, and the advantage resulting from it is great 
in point both of productiveness and of beauty. 

The usual duration of leases is nineteen years. 

There is room for improvement in the farm-buildings or stead- 
ings, both of landlords and tenants. In no situation in Scotland 
are hedges more easily and perfectly reared than in this district ; 
and there is increasing attention paid to this species of inclosure. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

There is only one village in the parish ; it has been greatly en- 
larged within the last twelve years. All the new houses are built 
substantially and in regular order. The town of Girvan is six 
miles from the village, Maybole seven, and Ayr sixteen. An ar- 
rangement was made, fourteen years ago, under- the sanction of 
the General Post- Office, by which the letters for the village were 
brought every day from the post-town, Maybole ; and for the last 
five years a branch post-office from Maybole has been regularly 
estabhshed. The parish is well supplied with roads; on the 
north side of the valley, one turnpike-road extends about five miles; 
another runs through the valley, and along the south side, about 
six miles and a half. From these, three other turnpike-roads 
branch off" to the right and left for a mile or two. A coach passes 
and repasses through the parish on Friday, on its route between 
Girvan and Ayr. There are three public bridges and one pri- 
vate bridge across the Girvan ; and there is a number of other 
bridges across smaller streams. Some of them have been erected 
at great expense, for the sake of the new lines of road which were 
lately formed. All are at present in good condition, and from the 
attention paid to the state of the roads, are likely to be kept in 
thorough repair. 

Ecclesiastical Stafc.— The parish church stood originally at Old 
DaiUy, about three miles from its present site, but was removed in 
1696 to the village of New Dailly, a very centrical situation for 
all the inhabitants. The present fabric was built in 1766, and is 
in good repair. It will accommodate 650 persons. In 1835 a 



DAILLY. 



£89 



change was made upon the interior of the building, by which 70 
new sittings were obtained. Thirty free sittings are reserved for 
the poor. 

The manse was built in 1801, and had an addition made to it 
in 1818. 

The glebe consists of 7 acres of arable land, which might yield 
a rent of L. 14 or L. 16 per annum. 

The stipend was augmented in 1818. It now consists of L.345, 
16s. 5d. ; 17 pecks and 3i lippies of barley, and 18 pecks and 2j 
lippies of meal. This is the whole of the teinds, conform to the 
valuations of the heritors produced. 

Of the families in the parish, 400 may be stated as belonging 
to the Established Church. The I'emaining twenty families are 
mostly Roman Catholics. The Dissenters residing here are very 
few, not exceeding 12. Their places of worship are in Girvan, 
Maybole, or Colmonell. The parish church is well attended. 
The average number of communicants in attendance is 420. 

A society for religious purposes was instituted some years ago, 
but its meetings were never well attended, and latterly they have 
been discontinued. The average amount of church collections, 
yearly, for religious and charitable objects, has been about L. 5. 
In 1836-7 above L. 14 were collected for the four schemes of the 
General Assembly. There was also a collection in the same year 
for the Scottish Missionary Society, and there was another, above 
L. 6, for the parish Sabbath schools. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish; one paro- 
chial, and three private. The branches generally taught in all the 
schools are, English reading and grammar, Latin, writing, arith- 
metic, book-keeping and mensuration. The parochial teacher has 
a salary of L. 30, and the legal accommodations, and his school fees 
may amount to L. 25 per annum. One of the other teachers re- 
ceives from the landed proprietor, by whom his school was establish- 
ed, a salary of L. 5, and he has besides a school-house, a dwelling- 
house and garden, and coals. The proprietor of Bargany and the 
tacksman of the Bargany coal, pay another teacher L. 5 annually, 
and furnish him with a school-room ; an apartment for himself, and 
a large garden. The only advantage which the remaining teacher 
has, is the use of a school-room on another part of the Bargany 
estate. The school fees are paid monthly, at the following rates, 
—for English, lOd. ; English and writing. Is. 2d.; arithmetic, 



390 



AYRSHIRE. 



with the preceding branches. Is. 4d. ; Latin, with the preceding, 
Is. 8d. 

The benefits of education are duly prized by all the inhabitants. 
Their children are sent to school, and are instructed at home at a 
very early age, so that in all probability there is not one of six 
years of age who has not begun to read. Almost all take lessons 
in writing. Whatever may be the case in some parts of Scotland, 
it is a mistake to suppose, that the education of children in this 
quarter is to any extent neglected. The data upon which this 
opinion has been formed have been taken from the numbers ac- 
tually attending school at a given time. But because these num- 
bers do not come up to the proportion that should be receiving in- 
struction in a well ordered community, it does not follow that the 
remaining children are growing up in total ignorance. A labour- 
ing man cannot afford to send to school at one and the same time 
all his children who are at an age for attending it. But he gives 
a year's schooling to one, and then a year's schooling to another, 
- and then revives the education of the first by an additional quarter 
for him ; and so on with the others, till the whole of his children 
are enabled to read tolerably well, and do accounts. Many of the 
young people, after they are grown up, attend the evening-schools, 
which the teachers are in the practice of keeping during a part of 
the year. From the situation of the different schools, there is 
easy access to one or other of them, from all parts of the parish. 

Literature. — A parochial library was established in 1819, and 
now contains 162 volumes. The rate of subscription is very mo- 
derate, and a payment of L. 2 at once constitutes a free member, 
or gives a right to the use of the library for life. The pressure of 
the times, or some other cause, has prevented the funds of the li- 
brary from increasing to any extent. 

Friendly Societies. — A friendly society was instituted about 
twenty-five years ago. During a part of that time, it was in a 
flourishing condition, but there were obvious defects in some of 
its rules ; these have been partially removed. The terms of ad- 
mission, as compared with the allowances granted to the sick, are 
still too small. But various means have been adopted to prevent 
its funds from being materially injured. The benefit which it has 
conferred in providing for a period of sickness is well understood, and 
very highly appreciated. A female friendly society was instituted 
ten or twelve years ago. It is composed at present of 50 mem- 



DAILLY. 



391 



bers, and promises to do well. It is now managed entirely by the 
members. 

Savings Bank.— A savings bank has existed in this parish since 
1817. The total amount of the deposits at present is nearly L. 700. 
The payments made by the bank have for several years past ex- 
ceeded the deposits. Formerly the case was greatly the reverse. 
The deposits have varied from L. 100 to L. 130 yearly, but are 
now considerably below L. 100. In 1830, the sum withdrawn 
was rather more than L. 167. In 1831, it was about L. 140. In 
1833, about L. 200. In 1834, about L. 190. Since then very 
little business has been done. The depositors are of various de- 
scriptions. There are some old people who have lodged in the 
savings bank the little surplus that remains to them of their for- 
mer earnings. There are farm-servants, labourers, colliers, fe- 
males who live by their needle, children in whose names their pa- 
rents have entered small sums as a security for their having some- 
thing wherewith to educate them, or send them out into the world. 
The treasurers of the friendly societies also lodge their spare cash 
in the savings bank. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is 45, and the average sum allotted to each 
is L. 2, 7s. yearly. 

The funds for the poor, which the benevolence or economy of 
former times had accumulated, were all expended about fourteen 
years ago. An annual contribution, of from L. 80 to L. 100, is 
now made by the heritors, to eke out the provision which is raised 
for the poor from the church collections and other sources. The 
collections used to amount to about L. 50 annually, but have lat- 
terly fallen much short of that sum, principally on account of he- 
ritors residing less in the parish than they did. Other funds des- 
tined for the relief of the poor, arising from dues on proclamations 
of marriages, &amp;c. average about L. 1 5. 

The cases are few in which reluctance is shewn to apply for pa- 
rochial relief, or in which the idea of its being degrading to do so 
is entertained. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The general appearance of the parish is very much improved 
within the last twelve years, and, consequently, still more so since 
the last Statistical Account was drawn up. The sale at the coal- 
works then was about 9000 tons. It is now about 20,000. The 
produce of the woods was estimated then at L. 200 yearly. It is 



392 



AYRSHIRE. 



now about L. 1200. There is not so much grain raised now as 
formerly on some of the best land in the parish, a great part of it 
having been laid down in pasture, with large plantations inter- 
spersed. It is perhaps in consequence of this altered style of cul- 
tivation that the village contiguous to the church contains now 550 
instead of 170 inhabitants, as formerly. Several parts of the pa- 
rish, which were known as separate farms of considerable extent, 
are at present without a single dwelling upon them. Notwith- 
standing the increase of the population, and the larger mass that 
is assembled in one place, the number of ale-houses or spirit- 
shops is diminished by more than a half. There were formerly 
eighteen, there are now only eight. The number was restricted 
lately from a conviction of the injurious effects which the facility of 
obtaining ardent spirits must produce on the morals of the people. 
The only other observation which it seems necessary to make re- 
spects the increased means of education. Formerly several fa- 
milies in the remote parts of the parish united together to engage 
a private teacher, for two or three months, for the benefit of their 
children. That system is now unnecessary ; and the poorest chil- 
dren, by attending at the Sunday schools, have an excellent op- 
portunity both of being instructed in the truths of religion, and of 
keeping up any little education which they have received. There 
are six schools of that description in the parish.  

September 1837. 

 A very remarkable instance recently occurred of the tenacity of human life, or 
the length of time that existence may be continued without any apparent means of 
support. At the end of twenty- three days, a man, who had been enclosed in a coal- 
pit, was taken out alive. 

On October 8, 1035, about five in the morning, part of the Kilgrammie coal-pit, 
on the estate of Bargany, fell in. The crush continued for two days, so as to render 
it extremely dangerous to enter the pit. All the colliers escaped except .John Brown, 
an unmarried man, above sixty, who either did not hear the noise of the fall, or disre- 
garded it, till he found himself enclosed in the ruins. Attempts were made to ex- 
tricate him at different times; but the foul air which had collected in the pit, and 
other circumstances, prevented their success. The idea of his being alive after a fort- 
night was scarcely entertained by any one. But the place where Brown had been 
at work, all continued anxious to reach. Great progress was made in clearing a 
passage to it on Cctober 30th. Some of the colliers, in the belief that groans had 
been heard, l eturned to the work in the course of the night, and after three hours' 
labour, they found him lying on the ground, still living, and able to recognize them, 
but so feeble, that the utmost he could say was the first syllabic of one of their names. 
The aperture by which they had entered was so low and small, for a considerable 
way, tliat it was only by laying him on a board, and shoving it along, that he could 
be taken out. A considerable time also had to pass before he could be raised to the 
pit head, as at three or four in the morning, none were astir but tlie men who were with 
him. During the interval, they stripped themselves of their own clothes, to cover 
him from the air. One had the remains of a piece of bread and butter which he had 
carried with him to the pit, and with the butter he rublcd the poor man's lips, which 
were excessively dry and parched. Another ran to a distance by the level, and raised

a nci"-hbour to milk her cow, as Brown had expressed a desire for milk. A third 
went°by the same way to acquaint their master with Brown's being alive, and to pro- 
cure assistance for bringing him to the ground. Tlie rest lay in succession with their 
naked backs to his, to produce something like natural heat, in his almost ice-cold 
bodv. The news quickly spread of his having been found alive, and visitors innu- 
merable crowded to the cottage where he was. By 9 o'clock, when the writer of 
these pages saw him, he was comfortably laid on the bed which he had been accus- 
tomed to occupy. There was then an agreeable warmth on his skin, and although 
he spoke slowly and little, yet he was perfectly collected. His appearance was very 
striking, from the length of his black and glossy beard, the hollowness of his eyes, 
and their extreme brightness, as if they had been glazed. The odour of his breath 
was particularly offensive. After answering some questions, it was his own request 
that prayer should be offered up for him. When the ]rayer was finished, he grasped 
his minister's hand, and expressed his thanks. A medical man attended him repeat- 
edly. Instructions were given to those about him, as to the mode in which he should 
be treated ; and for a day or two, it seemed as if there was a possibility of his re- 
gaining strength. But on November 2d, he began to sink, and on the evening of 
the 3d he quietly expired. Much interest was excited about " Brown." The She- 
riff of the county was ordered to inquire into the circumstances, which led him to 
be so long immured, and also into the state of his body after death. But nothing 
was elicited to attach blame, either on account of the length of his imprisonment, or 
on account of the treatment which he received while under medical care. A copy 
of the report on the post mortem examination has been obligingly furnished for in- 
sertion in this work, and is subjoined to this statement. To many, it may be inte- 
resting to have a correct description of the bodily state of a person who was so long 

buried alive, _ • .1  , ■ o , 

He had a lamp with him in the pit, and a portion of oil to teed it. But he was 
in total darkness during almost the whole time of his hnprisonment. The oil he ne- 
ver thought of tasting, and he had no food of any kind. As long as he was able to 
walk, he'drank of the strongly impregnated water which flowed through the room in 
which he worked. It was from thirst alone he said that he suffered. For about a 
fortnio-ht he was able to walk to and fro. After that he had not strength lo reach 
the stream which served to allay his thirst. He never lost the hope of being taken 
out. His mind therefore was calm. There wns no exciting cause to wear out his 
existence. He had some notion of the progress of time, from hearing the colliers at 
work ; and he always conceived that they were attempting to reach him. " Boys," he 
said to them after he was able to speak, " Oh, but you were long of coming." Of 
his thoughts and feelings he could give no account; and owing to his enfeebled state, 
it was impossible to press him with questions on the subject. That he was sensible 
of the wonderful care which had been exercised ovei- him, and of his very precarious 
state, may, it is hoped, be inferred from his asking to be commended to God in prayer.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. PETER M'MASTER, MINISTER. 



I.— Topography and Natural History 
Name, Boundaries, c— GirVan takes its name, no doubt, from 
the small river at the mouth of which it is situated. The name at 
one time written GriffanJ seems to be derived from two Celtic 
words, signifying a rapid stream, and is descriptive enough of the 
river for several miles below its source. This parish lies on the sea 
coast of Carrick, about midway between the well-known points of 
Bennan and Turnberry. Its length from south-south-west to north- 
north-east is 9 imperial miles ; and its breadth from 2 to 7 miles. The 
mean breadth, as nearly as can be computed, is 4 miles, which 
gives a surface of 36 square miles, or 19,000 acres. It is bounded 
on the east by the parishes of DaiUy and Barr ; on the south, by the 
parish of Colmonell ; on the west, for nearly its whole length, by 
the sea; and on the north by the parish of Kirkoswald. 

Topographical Appearances.— K ridge of fine hills, that might 
almost be called mountainous, runs across the parish in a somewhat 
diagonal direction, and divides it, as it were, into two distinct dis- 
tricts. When viewed from the neighbourhood of the town of Gir- 
van, this ridge appears truly grand. Its average height is about 
900 feet, and its highest point not less than 1200 feet above the 
level of the sea. On the south side of it, the ground is high and 
coarse, and, where not cultivated, covered with heath. On the 
north side, though not uniformly level, it is low and of fine quality. 

Meteorologij.— Omag to the great difference of elevation, the 
temperature is variable. In wet weather, the clouds being attract- 
ed by the hills, considerably more rain falls in the high than in the 
low part of the parish. In the former district, too, especially in 
spring and autumn, the frost is often so strong as to injure the po- 
tatoc crops, when it is scarcely at all perceptible in the latter. The 
prevailing winds are from the west and south-west; but the rains 
which occasion the greatest floods generally fall wlien the wind is 



GIRVAN.

from a point to the east of south. Owing to the proximity of the 
Atlantic, the average moisture of the atmosphere is greater than 
in the more eastern parts of the island ; but the soil being light 
and dry, and upon a sandy, or gravelly, or rocky bottom, the cli- 
mate is, upon the whole, mild, and remarkably salubrious. 

Hydrography. — Though, as compared with most places, the sur- 
face of the parish be dry, there is no want of a necessary sup- 
ply of water. Excellent springs are to be found at convenient dis- 
tances ; and there are three running streams, viz. the Girvan ; the 
Lendal, which falls into the sea at the bay of Carleton ; and the 
Assel, which falls into the Stinchar, opposite the house of Pinmore, 
in the parish of Colmonell. Except the Girvan, however, these 
streams are very small ; but as they never run dry, they are ex- 
tremely useful for the watering of cattle. There are only two 
lochs in the parish, the Loch ton and the Laggan ; and these, though 
deep, are so very diminutive in point of surface, as scarcely to be 
worthy of notice. 

Geology. — Though the vale of Girvan abounds with coal, yet it 
would appear that the strata all terminate above the boundary of 
this parish, for none of that valuable fossil has ever yet been 
found in it. In the east side of the parish, however, there is abun- 
dance of excellent limestone, which has been wrought pretty ex- 
tensively for upwards of twenty-five years, and tended very much 
to the improvement of the surrounding country. Copper has also 
been found in the parish ; and it is thought by many, whose opi- 
nions should have some weight, that a rich store of it is in reserve 
for future enterprise, especially in the estate of Ardmillan. One or 
two attempts have been made to determine the point, which did 
not prove successful, but they were on a scale so very limited, as 
to be by no means decisive. What little ore was got, was of the 
first quality ; and in working for the copper, two or three beautiful 
specimens of asbestos were discovered. There is some red free- 
stone, a good deal of blue whinstone, and several detached masses 
of graystone ; but the rock which abounds most, and particularly 
in the neighbourhood of the sea, is what is commonly called rotten- 
rock, or puddingstone, the old red sandstone of some geologists. 
The shore, for several miles, is bound by this rock, which in many 
places assumes a most fantastical appearance ; it dips in all direc- 
tions, but chiefly towards the sea, at an angle of not more than 
from five to ten degrees. In many instances, mass of it is seen 
piled upon mass, and resting frequently on props so narrow, as to

make one feel astonished that they do not lose their balance. They 
seem, indeed, as if they lhad been placed in their present position 
by the nicest efforts of art. 

II. — Civil History. 

There are no historical events of importance to be mentioned in 
connection with this parish ; nor has it given birth jto any who have 
been particularly distinguished in public life, with the exception, 
perhaps, of the well-known cousins, Robert and Zachary Boyd, who, 
a somewhat uncertain tradition says, were born in the house of 
Trochrigg, of which Robert was doubtless a member. In later times, 
a few highly respectable clergymen have been born, and received 
the rudiments of their education, in the parish. 

Land-ow7ters.—The whole of the parish is in the possession of 
ten proprietors. The Duchess de Coigney holds nearly the half; 
the other principal proprietors are, Mr Kennedy of Dunure, Mr 
Craufurd of Ardmillan, and Mr Fergusson of Trochrigg, the 
Marquis of Ailsa, Sir John Cathcart of Carleton, Mr Boyd of 
Penkil, Mr Hamilton of Pinmore, Mr Onslow of Balkissock, and 
Mr Johnstone of Trolorg, are the other proprietors. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers commence in 
1733, since which period a pretty regular account of births has 
been kept, — but of marriages and deaths, the account was very im- 
perfectly kept, down to the year 1825, when a correct record of 
marriages commenced ; but a record of deaths is still wanting. 

Antiquities. — There is but little here to attract the notice of the 
antiquarian. Five of those round inclosures, commonly called 
camps, can still be distinctly traced. Two of them are very near 
the sea, and none of them more than two miles and a-half from it. 
One of them is remarkable for having two parallel ditches, which 
surround the top of the hill oil which it is situated. Formerly 
there were a number of cairns in the high part of the parish, but 
these have been almost wholly demolished for the purpose of making 
fences. On removing one of them, there was found, in a kind of 
coffin, formed of broad thin stones, an earthen urn, unglazed, and 
rudely ornamented. It held about the quantity of two English 
pints, and contained a small portion of something like ashes.

On comparing the above state of the parish with that in 1791, it 
would seem that, in few places of Scotland, has the population in- 
creased in such rapid proportion as in Girvan. This has been 
chiefly owing to the encouragement given to the building of small 
houses in the town, which are soon filled with the lowest orders of 
the people of Ireland, who come over with the view of obtaining 
employment in the weaving of cotton. The increase is chiefly of 
this description ; though, in the same period, there has been an in- 
crease in the country part of the parish of about 500, who are chief- 
ly engaged in agriculture. 

Character and Habits of the People.— In no part of the kingdom 
are people, of the same rank in society, more respectable than the 
native inhabitants of this parish. They are possessed of honour- 
able feelings, strict integrity, and great aff'ability and kindness, to- 
gether with a strong sense of that independence so characteristic of 
the people of Scotland in former times. In point of dress and 
diet, they do not indulge beyond their means .; but they are not be- 
hind their neighbours, in what may be called real improvement, in 
these particulars. So much, however, cannot be said of that por- 
tion of the population which is properly Irish. They have but very 
little, indeed, of that independence of spirit for which the native in- 
habitants are distinguished. They are improvident ; and, in the day 
of need, so far from shewing reluctance at receiving charity, they 
are often unreasonably clamant. On their first arrival from Ire- 
land, many of them are much more hke mendicants than people 
intending to support themselves by their own industry. In a day 
or two, perhaps, the father of the family, for they often come in 
large families, gets employment upon the loom, and the mother 
and children, set out, in diff"erent directions, and actually beg. The 
apartments in which they reside are very uncomfortable; there is 
little or no regard to cleanliness, and their beds are absolutely wretch- 
ed. This description, however, does not apply to all ; for there are 
certainly some, especially of those who have been for years settled 
in the parish, and got connected with the natives by marriage, who 
are careful, cleanly, and comfortable; but the bulk of them are 



398 



AYRSHIRE. 



very, much the reverse; and, from their great numbers, tliey have 
certainly had a deteriorating influence, especially on the younger 
part of the community. One delinquency, almost peculiar to an 
Irishman, namely, the desertion of his wife and children, requires 
to be particularly noticed, as having frequently occasioned a seri- 
ous drain from the poor's funds. In short, thougih the proprietors 
of houses, and the manufacturing agents, encourage the settlement 
of the Irish with a view to make gain by them, and may for a 
time succeed, they seem not to take into account the vast injury 
which, in a moral point of view, they are entailing on the rising 
generation, nor the incalculable increase which they are uninten- 
tionalhj, he it granted, making to the expenditure absolutely neces- 
sary for the support of the poor. 

When smuggling was common in the country, it was alleged of 
some of the people of Girvan that they were not backward in 
taking a share in it ; but the hurtful nature of that traffic was not 
then seen by the community in general in its true light; and it is 
pleasant to state that, for the last thirty years, few instances of 
smuggling have been heard of in the parish ; and, at present, it may 
be safely affirmed that no such thing exists. 

In the course of the last three years, there were 44 illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

Beyond a few patches of brushwood, there is scarcely any natu- 
ral wood in the parish ; and forty years ago there was little or 
nothing in the shape of plantation. Since that period, however, 
two or three proprietors, and particularly the late Sir Hew Dal- 
rymple Hamilton of Bargany, have planted on a small scale, and 
succeeded as well as, in a maritime district, could have been rea- 
sonably expected. 

Rent of Land. — The quality of the land varies exceedingly, 
that in the high part of the parish, as before stated, being coarse, 
and a large proportion of it incapable of cultivation, except at a 
ruinous expense; while that in the low part is of the finest 
quality. The rent, therefore, may be supposed to vary accord- 
ingly. From 5s. to 12s. an acre may be considered as the rent 
of the high, and from L. 1 to L. 4 that of the low district. In 
the immediate neighbourhood of the town, where the land is ex- 
cellent, several fields have been let as high as L. 6 and L. 7 an 
acre ; and the farm of Girvan Mains, consisting of 500 acres, 
brought an average rent of L. 3, 5s. an acre, during the currency 



G I RYAN. 



399 



of a nineteen years lease. The gross rental of the landward pa- 
rish may be staled at L. 12,000. The old valued rental, as en- 
tered in the county cess-books, is L. 4639, 3s. 

Rate of Wages. — The wages of farm-servants are lower than 
they were fifteen or twenty years ago. Then, L. 20 a year, with 
bed and board, was quite conimon for able experienced servants, 
whereas now, the same description of persons can be easily had 
for L. 14 or L. 16 a year. Lads, again, able for most kinds of 
men's work, can be readily hired at from L. 9 to L. 12. Girls, 
fit for managing a dairy, get about L. 8, and house-servants, par- 
ticularly in the town, get from L. 4 to L. 7 a year. In harvest, 
shearers are mostly hired by the day ; and, on an average, get 
about Is. 6d. without victuals. At times, however, such as when 
the harvest is late, or when there happens to be a great deal of 
ripe grain, and a prospect of bad weather, they get 2s. or 2s. 6d. 
But such wages are rarely given ; and the chief reason why har- 
vest-work is fully as low here as in most parts of the country, 
seems to be, that a great many of the cotton weavers prefer a few 
days of the healthful labour of the reaping-field, to their ordinary 
airless and sedentary occupation. Tradesmen generally work by 
the piece, and, like the farm-servants, are getting less wages than 
formerly. When employed by the day, wrights and masons get 
about 2s. 6d. without victuals, and tailors from Is. 3d. to Is. 6d., 
with bed and board. 

Breeds of Live-Stock. — The live-stock is very different from 
what it was forty years ago, both as to quantity and quality. At 
that period, there were about 1700 head of black-cattle, and 214 
scores of sheep in the parish ; whereas now there is only about 
the one-half of either. The cattle were then almost all of the 
Galloway breed, and the sheep of the small black-faced kind. 
These have been succeeded, the former by the Ayrshire breed, 
chiefly for the dairy, and the latter, by a much larger boned 
stock of the black-faced, and, in some instances, by Cheviots. 
The reasons of the decrease in the numbers of live-stock, there- 
fore, are obvious. In the first place, the animals are both heavier 
and better fed than formerly ; and, in the second place, there is 
now a much greater proportion of the land bearing grain, than 
there was at the period above alluded to. It has become a prac- 
tice with farmers, who have from a dozen to twenty cows, and up- 
wards, particularly on out-farms, to let what is called a booing of 
them for the season. They bind themselves to give a reasonable

AYRSHIRE. 



supply of food, both during summer and winter, and in return, get 
from L. 6, 10s. to L. 8 for each cow, according to the situation 
a nd the quality of the keep. This practice seems to be becoming 
more and more common, and has obvious advantages. The own- 
ers of the cows, who have frequently quite enough to occupy their 
time and attention otherwise, are relieved of a great deal of care, 
while the booers, on the other hand, get an interest in the ma- 
nagement, which is supposed to add considerably to the value of 
the produce. There are but few horses, comparatively speaking, 
bred in the parish, the feeding of milch-cows being found to be 
more profitable. More than a half of all the horses used for 
agriculture, and other purposes, come from Ireland. These, in 
point of bone, are inferior to the Clydesdale breed, but they have 
more action, and are kept at less expense. Swine are now fed by 
almost every family in the landward part of the parish, and also 
by many of the people of the town. In the town, a poor man, by 
carefully mixing the ashes of his kitchen, and a little sea-weed, of 
which there is abundance in the neighbourhood, with the dung from 
the pig-sty, frequently makes up as much manure as is sufficient for 
the cultivation of a rood of potatoe ground, which he rents for 
about 15s. and from which, in common cases, he raises as many 
potatoes as amply supply his family, provided it be of a moderate 
size, for a whole year. 

Husbandry. — The low-lands are admirably fitted for the plough, 
and, at one period or other, about the half of the whole parish has 
been under cultivation. When the last Statistical Account was 
drawn up, oats, barley, bear, peas, beans, and potatoes, were the 
only crops commonly raised. Wheat and rye were occasionally 
tried on a small scale ; but the former was thought an uncertain 
crop, and the latter found profitable only where the soil was light 
and sandy. At the present period, wheat may be said to be the 
principal crop. Indeed, there is hardly an acre of the low land 
upon which it has not been repeatedly grown during the last 
thirty years, and in most cases with ample success. From ten 
to fifteen bolls of 4 Winchester bushels per Scotch acre, was 
no unusual return from the best lands, when the cultivation 
of wheat began to be understood. As might be expected, the 
produce has decreased, where the land has been subjected to se- 
vere cropping, and particularly where wheat has been repeatedly 
raised ; but still, it is no uncommon thing to see from eight to ten 
bolls grown on an acre where there have been alternate crops of 



GIRVAN. 



401 



wheat and potatoes for upwards of twenty years. This, however, 
is chiefly owing to the great quantity of sea-weed which is got in 
the immediate neighbourhood, and the manure that is suppHedby 
the town. With these advantages, the farmer is enabled, not only 
to prepare his land in the best style for the green crop, but also 
to give it a thorough top-dressing before sowing the wheat. And, 
strange as it may seem to those unacquainted with this mode of 
management, the wheat raised in this way is equal in all respects, 
if not superior, to what can be raised with the utmost care on land 
little, if any thing, inferior in quality, and with a four or six shift 
rotation, where the incalculable advantage of an abundant supply 
of extra manure is wanting. Let it not be supposed, however, 
that the advantage arising from sea-weed, &amp;c. is a clear gain to 
the farmer, — far from it ; such extra manure can only be obtained 
by a great deal of hard labour, and at a very considerable expense, 
and is fully estimated by the proprietor, in the letting of the land. 
In all the low, and in some portions of the high district of the 
parish, the soil is particularly favourable for turnip husbandry, and 
for several years past, a considerable quantity of the different kinds 
of turnips have been sown with marked success; still, however, 
potatoes seem to be the favourite green crop, owing chiefly to the 
land being got sooner cleared after them, than after turnips, for the 
sowing of the wheat. 

Irrigation is scarcely known in the parish, and furrow-draining, 
now so universally approved of, is only in its infancy. This, how- 
ever, is owing, not so much to any backwardness, either on the part 
of the proprietors or tenants, to this expensive improvement, as to 
the fact, that from the nature of its subsoil, this parish, upon the 
whole, requires draining less perhaps than the same continuous 
quantity of surface, in almost any district of the country. Still 
it must be allowed, that considerable portions of it require draining, 
particularly of the kind above-mentioned ; and it is pleasant to re- 
mark, that the system has actually commenced, and with a fair 
prospect of being carried on to the necessary extent. With very 
few exceptions, the leases are of nineteen years duration, nor does 
a shorter period seem at all desirable for either landlord or tenant. 
Within the last forty years, almost all the farm-houses in the 
parish have either been rebuilt., or otherwise much improved, par- 
ticularly on the properties belonging to Mr Kennedy of Dunure, 
and Mr Craufurd of Ardmillan. On the farm of Girvan Mains 
alone, Mr Kennedy, upwards of twenty years ago, laid out about

L. 5000 in building houses, and that, too, without exacting the usual 
per centage from the tenant. The farm -steading then erected on 
this valuable property is equal perhaps, both as to accommodation 
and appearance, to any yet to be met with in Scotland. 

Produce. — It is not to be expected that the amount of the raw 
produce of the parish can be stated with exact, precision, but, as 
nearly as could be ascertained, it is as follows. 

Wheat, 2600 quarters, at L. 2 per quarter. - - L. 3200 0 0 

Barley and bear .590 do. at L. 1, 5s. per do. - - - 737 10 0

L. 2-3,302 0 0 

Fisheries — The Girvan is frequented by salmon, and for a long 
period there has been a considerable fishing at the mouth of it, 
held, under Crown charters, by the proprietor of the estate of Bar- 
gany on the south, and the proprietor of the estate of Dunure 
on the north side. In former times, the mode of taking the sal- 
mon was by net and coble, but now stake-nets are substituted. 
Till very lately, the regular fishers experienced no interference on 
the part of the public ; but for two or three years past, people 
have taken the liberty of putting down, what are called hag-nets 
all along the coast, and even on the ground formerly claimed by 
the proprietors, and in that way have killed a great many fish. 
This inroad is naturally enough opposed by the proprietors, and 
the matter is just now before the law courts, but as yet undecided. 

The bay of Girvan seems intended by nature as an excellent 
white-fishing station ; and experience has proved that most of the 
best kinds, such as cod, haddock, whiting, mackerel, sole, floun- 
der, turbot, and lobster, are to be found in it. Strange to tell, 
however, the taking of these fish has never been prosecuted with 
much energy. Nor have the Irish weavers, when unemployed, 
and in a state of utter destitution, in consequence of a stagnation 
of trade, been at all in the habit of endeavouring to support their 
starving families with this easily acquired and excellent food. One 
spirited individual in particular, however, namely, Mr William 
Johnston, banker, has exerted himself much of late, and even sa- 
crificed a considerable sum of money, to have the white-fishing

on this coast turned to more account, and, it is to be hoped, with 
some prospect of final success. 

V, — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communication. — Besides Girvan, which is a market 
and a post-town, there is neither town nor village in the parish. 
There is an easy communication, however, with every place of im- 
portance in the neighbourhood, by means of excellent turnpike 
roads. The Glasgow and Port-Patrick road runs along the west 
side of the parish, and with but little deviation from the sea shore, 
for nearly nine miles. There are also good inland roads, which 
branch off in every direction, and render the communication as 
convenient and easy as could reasonably be desired. 

Town of Girvan. — This town is a burgh of barony by charter 
granted originally to Mr Thomas Boyd of Ballochtoul, and re- 
newed by King William to Sir Archibald Muir of Thornton in 
the year 1696. The powers granted by the original charter were 
regularly handed down, but never acted on till the year 1785, 
when Girvan actually assumed the form of a burgh of barony, and 
still continues to enjoy the liberties and privileges belonging to 
other burghs of the same name. It is beautifully situated on a 
fine bay, and commands a magnificent view of the sea ; of the 
north coast of Ireland, of the rock of Ailsa, of the Mull and 
promontory of Cantire ; of the islands of Sanda, Arran, Plada, 
Little Cumbrae ; part of Bute, and the hills of Cowal. No situa- 
tion in the Island can be more healthy ; for though a great pro- 
portion of the inhabitants be poor, crowded, ill-lodged, and by no 
means attentive to cleanliness, yet infectious diseases are almost 
unknown. Till very lately, the harbour was quite in a state of 
nature, admitting at full tide, with from nine to eleven feet water in 
the mouth of the river, only the smallest description of vessels ; but a 
quay has been built on a very limited scale, which has contributed 
much to the facility of shipping coals and grain, and demonstrated 
the possibility of making Girvan a very useful harbour at a mo- 
derate expense. The principal proprietor is said to have the 
improvement of the harbour at present in contemplation, the exe- 
cution of which, on a somewhat liberal scale, together with a rail- 
way to the neighbouring collieries, must of necessity be accom- 
plished, before Girvan can enjoy the full benefit of its admirable 
situation. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The Church of Girvan is situated, very 
improperly, in the centre of the town, and quite close to the street 



404 



AYRSHIRE. 



which there forms the Glasgow and Port- Patrick road ; so that the 
congregation are very often disturbed, during the time of Divine 
worship, by the rattling of carriages and other annoyances which 
cannot be prevented. It was built above sixty years ago, when the 
population of the parish was not the one-fourth part of its present 
amount ; and though an aisle was since added to it by Sir Hew 
Dalrymple Hamilton of Bargany, for the accommodation of his 
feuars in the town, it is still very inadequate, affording only about 
850 sittings for a population of nearly 7000 souls. The minister 
has a manse, and a glebe of 6 imperial acres, with a stipend of 
15 chalders, half oat-meal, and half barley, payable by the fiars 
of the county. This stipend was modified six-and~twenty years 
ago, and is not greater at present than several of those in the 
neighbourhood, where there is scarcely a fifth part of the popula- 
tion ; but there is still free teind in the parish sufficient to raise it 
to an equality with other livings in similar situations. 

There is no chapel of ease or Episcopalian chapel in the parish ; 
but about twenty years ago, on the heritors refusing to enlarge or 
rebuild the church, there was first a Burgher meeting-house erect- 
ed, and afterwards a small Methodist chapel, which has been ge- 
nerally used, on the week days, as a private school-house. The 
Roman Catholics, too, have a small apartment where they meet 
for public worship every sixth Sunday ; but neither they nor the 
Methodists have ever had a stated minister. In the Burgher 
meeting-house, however, there has been a minister officiating re- 
gularly, ever since it was built. Still, by far the greater number 
of the parishioners adhere to the Established Church, and many 
more would attend, provided they could get seats. The average 
number of communicants is about 1200, who could not all have 
the long-enjoyed and highly-valued privilege of communicatuig on 
the same day, and under the same roof, were it not for the use of 

a tent. , i i r 

The number of families in the parish attendnig the chapels ot 
Dissenters or Seceders is 200, inclusive of 100 of Roman Catholics. 

Education.— The parochial schoolmaster has the maximum sa- 
lary, with an allowance of L. 20 a-year in lieu of a house and gar- 
den. He gets the interest of L. 1000, {inijius the legacy-duty, 
and two guineas a-year for prizes, the bequest of the late Mrs 
Craufurd of Ardmillan, on condition of his teachmg gratis forty 
poor children, twenty of whom are to be taught English reading 
onlv; ten, English reading and writing; and the remammg ten. 



GlllVAN.

arithmetic, book-keeping, geography, and navigation. Mrs Crau- 
fiu-d's Will also provides that ten of said forty children, who shall 
be found best qualified by voice and ear, shall be taught sacred 
music by the precentor of the parish church, for which, indepen- 
dently of the sum left to the schoolmaster, he shall receive L. 12 
annually, but which L. 12 has also been found subject to a deduc- 
tion of 10 per cent, for legacy-duty. The teacher may receive 
about L. 50 a-year of school fees. A few years ago, a school 
was instituted in the town by subscription, with the view chiefly of 
teaching the children of poor families to read the Scriptures and 
learn the catechism. A penny a-week is charged for each child 
whose parents can afford to give it ; but those who are considered 
unable to pay even that small sum are allowed to send their chil- 
dren free. This school is generally attended by from 100 to 150 
children, and has no doubt been the means of doing considerable 
good. Besides this subscription-school, there are always a good 
many private schools, both in the town and the landward part of 
the parish, most of which are well attended, and in which the or- 
dinary branches are respectably taught, and the fees extremely 
moderate ; so that, all things considered, the rising generation can- 
not be said to be in any want of the means of education. 

Libraries. — For upwards of thirty years, there has been a sub- 
scription library in the parish, but the annual contribution being 
low, it has never risen to great importance. Two circulating li- 
braries have been opened of late, which, from their novelty per- 
haps, seem to have higher attractions for the younger part of the 
community, and promise, of course, to be more extensively useful. 
A library has also been instituted by the Agricultural Society of 
the district, the use of which, however, is exclusively confined to 
their own members. 

Benevolent Societies. — Ever since the weaving of cotton was in- 
troduced into Girvan, the propriety of encouraging benevolent so- 
cieties has appeared evident to all the influential part of the com- 
munity ; hence one of these societies has been formed after an- 
other, till they have reached the number of twelve. They con- 
sist generally of from 60 to 80 members each ; and their main ob- 
ject is to supply sick and infirm members with aliment, amounting, 
in most cases, to 5s. weekly, when confined to bed, and 2s. 6d. 
when walking about, but unable to work. These societies are 
highly commendable. They are, with few exceptions, well conduct- 
ed, and have been the chief means, no doubt, of saving the parish 



406 



AYRSHIRE. 



IVom being heavily assessed for the support of the poor. With 
the exception of one female society, instituted about sixteen years 
ago, under the patronage of Mrs Craufurd of Ardmillan, and con- 
sisting originally of 66, but latterly of 70, members, — the others 
are all male societies. 

Poor. — The average annual amount of contributions for relief of 
the poor is L. 170 ; of which L. 70 arise from church collections, 
and L. 75 are voluntarily contributed by the heritors in the pro- 
portion of their respective valuations; and L. 15 arise from the 
interest of money mortified by the late Mrs Craufurd of Ardmillan. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was instituted in the parish, about 
the same time as the female society, and chiefly under the aus- 
pices of the same benevolent individual. Farm and house-servants 
have been the principal depositors ; but as the bulk of the popu- 
lation consists chiefly of Irish weavers, who, with very few excep- 
tions, indeed, can never be induced to deposit a single shilling, this 
institution has by no means realized the sanguine expectations of 
its original promoters. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

In conclusion, it may be observed, that this parish has under- 
gone, altogether, a very great change since the last Statistical Ac- 
count was published. The population is nearly four times what 
it was then ; the high lands have been enclosed ; small planta- 
tions have sprung up ; and good and convenient roads have been 
made, which have contributed much to the melioration of thousands 
of acres of coarse pasture land, by aff'ording a greater facility to the 
application of manure. In short, an entirely new mode of husbandry 
has been adopted, and is still progressing. In the town, too, the state 
of things is very different at the present day, from what it was forty 
years ago. Then, there were only about 100 looms employed in 
the weaving of cotton ; now, there are nearly 2000 ; — then, there 
were no means of transacting money matters within a less distance 
than twenty-one miles ; now, there are two respectable branch- 
banks, in each of which a very considerable deal of business is 
done ; — then, neither beef nor mutton was exposed for sale, from 
Martinmas to Whitsunday; now, there is a regular market for 
both during the whole year ; — then, the exportation of 
was rarely or ever heard of; now, it is no uncommon thing to see 
10,000 or 12,000 bolls of wheat shipped in a few months. These 
must be allowed to be great changes ; but changes greater still 
may be expected, from a railroad and an extended harbour.

PRESBYTERY OP AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. E. B. WALLACE, MINISTER. 



I —Topography and Natural History. 
Barr was erected into a parish in the year 1653, consisting of 
the more remote parts of the adjoining parishes of Girvan and 
Dailly. 

Name.— The etymology of the name is uncertam. If conjec- 
ture may be allowed, the small village of Barr, where the manse 
and kirk are built, and which has evidently given its name to 
the parish, was so called from its inaccessibleness, — being hem- 
med in on every side by precipitous hills, and approachable only 
by rugged glens, and across a stream, which, dwindling into a pur- 
ling rill in summer, rushes with a torrent's fury in winter, and, con- 
fining itself to no settled course, passes from side to side of the 
narrow strath through which it runs, and turns up every vestige of 
a roadway along its gravelly banks. The parish did, indeed, con- 
stitute a strong natural barrier between Galloway on the south and 
Ayrshire to the north, and was nearly inaccessible until within the 
last thirty years. 

Extent, c— The parish is of a regular oblong figure, and mea- 
sures, by a recent survey taken by Government, 12 miles by 9 ; 
but in any possible way of travelling is not less than 15 or 16 by 
10 or 11. It contains of course about 100 square miles. Its 
boundaries, beginning with the south-east side and proceeding 
roundward by the east, are Minnigaff in Galloway, Straiten, Dailly, 
Girvan, and Colmonell, which stretches out a long slender arm, 
encompassing a great part of it in the west and south, and push- 
ing itself like a wedge between Barr and Penningham, till it 
reaches Minnigaff, already mentioned. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish is very hilly, with an 
extensive flat : two ridges line the water of Stinchar, which rises 
and flows in the parish 14 or 15 miles. A third ridge runs pa- 
rallel to these on the south-east, and beyond lies the level country 



408 



AYRSHIRE. 



consisting almost wholly of untilled and mossy soil. These ranges 
rise to a height from 1000 to 1200 or 1400 feet above the level of 
the sea. A fourth range rises to 2700 feet. It runs in an oppo - 
site direction along the banks of the Minnoch, and forms the com- 
mencement of that line of almost mountainous elevation which 
stretches from Ayrshire into Galloway. 

The natural history of the parish does not furnish any thing 
remarkable. Palsy is prevalent ; but, on the whole, the parish is 
pecuharly healthy. 

There are several lochs varying from 6 to 1 2 and 1 5 feet deep, 
and abounding in two species of trout, of a dark colour, and bright 
yellow. The two principal streams are the Stinchar and the Min- 
noch. The Stinchar flows south-westerly, and passing through 
Colmonell, empties itself into the sea at Ballantrae, after a course 
of 25 miles. The Minnoch, after a few miles' run from the highest 
range southward, loses itself in the Cree, which separates this pa- 
rish and the county from Galloway. The velocity of these streams 
is very great. There is one cascade in the former above 30 feet. 
And on examination I find that there is scarcely one of the hundred 
burns in this parish that has not its fall of considerable height and 
beauty. The lochs are all destitute of wood, and so is the parish 
in general, with the exception of a little edging of copse on the 
banks of the Stinchar, and some young plantations of small extent, 
made by two proprietors within the last thirty years. 

Geology. — The geological structure of the parish consists of the 
slate formation, with a very high inclination. There are large irre- 
gular beds of conglomerate ; and there is some good limestone on 
the banks of the lower part of the Stinchar. In the limestone form- 
ing part of the bed of the river, some interesting and beautiful 
specimens of fossil shells have been recently observed. The 
limestone is occasionally wrought, and slate quarries have been 
opened, but not with equal success. No ores have been disco- 
vered. There are several mineral wells, chiefly chalybeate. One 
was once in repute, but others elsewhere have risen to fame, and 
it is forgotten. There is an immense extent of peat, with nume- 
rous remains of wood, chiefly birch and hazel. The soil in the 
holms is sharp and gravelly. A few of them are a good loam, 
and very productive ; that in the hills is nutritious when duly sup- 
plied with moisture ; but the great bulk of the parish consists of 
a wet, spongy, heathy, unproductive soil, with such grasses, sprit- 
bent, &amp;c. as are always found in land of a similar character.

II. — Civil History. 

From the modern erection of the parish, its civil history is ne- 
cessarily merged in that of others. A few ancient papers, all re- 
ferring to its erection, are in the possession of the minister. One 
of them has the signature of Oliver Cromwell. 

The birth-place of the great Viscount Stair is pointed to in this 
parish. His mother is said to have been overtaken, when travel- 
ling homeward from the north ; and the house, believed to be that 
in which she rested, is still in existence, forming part of the build- 
ings of the farm-steading of Dinmurchy, the property of Sir James 
Fergusson, Bart, of Kilkerran. 

Antiquities. — There are many monuments and traditions, re- 
cording the unjust and merciless sufferings to which the inhabi- 
tants of this parish were subjected during the period of persecution, 
from the Restoration to the happy Revolution. This parish ap- 
pears to have been particularly obnoxious. One memorial of Ro- 
man Catholic days exists in the ruin of a chapel called Kirk Do- 
mini, and in a well close by it, in the rising ground behind, and 
approached by a regularly built archway. On the site of this cha- 
pel, an annual fair is most inconveniently held on a Saturday. 

By far the chief land-owner is the Marquis of Ailsa. 

III. — Population. 
From some loose documents, consisting of lists of the inhabi- 
tants taken by a former minister of the parish, it appears that 
the population, sixty or seventy years ago, was nearly 800. Ac- 
cording to Dr Webster's report, it was 858. It was only 750 
when Mr Young wrote the last Statistical Account. Now, it 
amounts to 941 by the last census. The cause of this recent in- 
crease is the general change of habits throughout the kingdom, 
producing the erection of villages in various places where there 
were either none before, or where they were exceedingly small. 
The village of Barr contains 230 persons, chiefly weavers and 
trades-people. Formerly it contained much fewer. The country 
population, on the other hand, has diminished from a different cause, 
— from the increased size of the farms, but more especially from the 
improved method of managing stock, by which the same labour is 
done with fewer hands. There is probably also a greater gather- 
ing, both of labourers and of paupers, into villages than formerly; 
and this arises, I have no doubt, from the circumstance, that ser- 
vants, are no longer a permanent part of a master's family, and 
maintained by him under his eye, and in a cottage at his door.

According to the proportion of births to deaths, there ought 
to be a great annual increase. The registers are not very 
exact and faithful, many parents neglecting their duty in the 
registration of their children ; and of deaths there is no register. 
But I had occasion to keep an account for a short time of births 
and deaths, when I found there were thirty-seven of the for- 
mer and only seven of the latter; nor have I reason to think that 
this remarkable disproportion varies materially from the annual 
average. The supernumeraries, beyond the demand for farms 
and labour, slip off, as they rise up, to towns or other parts of the 
country, and not a few go abroad ; and it is thus the stationary na- 
ture of the population is preserved. 

The average of persons under 15 years old is . 349 

betwixt 15 and 30, . 255

There are no resident nobihty, nor gentlemen of independent 
fortune. There are fourteen proprietors of land yielding more than 
L. 50 per annum. There is one person fatuous, one insane, two 
imbecile, and two blind. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — On the subject of agriculture, I am sorry to say 
that little has been done except in the management of stock, but 
still more sorry to think that not a great deal can be done profit- 
ably. Of 60,000 or 70,000 acres, the contents of the parish, not 
more than 1200 are under tillage, and not much more than an- 
other 1 000 could be brought into an improved state, with repay- 
ment of expense and profit to the tenant. 

Plantations. — The indigenous trees are ash and alder, and would 
thrive and be useful, if protected ; but they lie open to sheep and 
cattle, in a neglected state. The late Lord AUoway, and Mr James 
Fergusson, Advocate, made some plantations of larch, ash, and 
oak, which are in a thriving state, and already serviceable, proving 
what might be done. 

Rent of Land. — The value of the arable land is not more than 
L. 1 per acre : a summer's grass for a cow costs L. 2, 5s. ; and 
the grazing of a ewe for a year, 4s. Wool costs 8s. 6d. a stone ; 
lint, 10s. per stone; oats from L. 1 to L. 1, 4s. per quarter; bar- 
ley, L. 1, 10s.; and potatoes, 7s. per boll of 8 bushels. 



DARR. 



411 



Live. Stock.— The universal breed of sheep is the black-faced. 
Considerable attention is paid to their improvement; and it is 
doubtful if inuch more can be done to insure this end. White- 
faced, to any considerable extent, are found not to answer. The 
cattle reared are of the Galloway breed. A few Highlanders are 
bought in, kept a year, and sold out again with advantage. A few 
dairy establishments of the Ayrshire breed of cows have been re- 
cently introduced, and are expected to succeed. 

Husbandry. — The system of husbandry pursued in the dry 
holming-ground is the four-shift. On the upland ground, two or 
three successive crops of oats are taken with good liming. The 
land is then sown down, and pastured four, five, or six years, 
sometimes to the end of the lease. Surface-draining has been 
carried to a great extent, and with good effects ; and march-fences, 
in several instances, have been erected ; but little more has been 
done, from a conviction that the tenant cannot be repaid. The 
leases are generally for nineteen years. 

Farm-Buildings. — The farm-buildings are very indifferent; 
the dwelHng-houses not suitable, except in a few cases of recent 
erection ; and the offices inconvenient, and often dirty. Much 
might be done both for the comfort and benefit of the tenant, 
and ultimately for the advantage of the landlord ; but one great and 
serious obstacle is, that the bulk of the land is entailed, and the 
proprietor naturally looks only to present returns, whilst the far- 
mer submits to inconveniences, and wishes to gain as much as he 
can, or, as often happens in present times, escape by losing as 
little as possible during his lease. There may be also, in some 
instances, a want of intelligence to perceive, and a want of enter- 
prise on the part of the farmer to pursue, his own real interest, 
when attended with an immediate outlay, and only a prospective 
gain. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce in this extensive 
parish is as follows : — 



Grain of all kinds, 400 acres, at L. 5 per acre, . L. 2000 

Potatoes, 130 acres, at L. 10 per acre, . . 1500 

Hay of all kinds, . . . . , 2000 

Flax, ....... 30

distant from the village of Barr. The post-office is also there. 

But a penny-post has been established lately on alternate days. 

There are only twenty-five miles of turnpike road in this huge 
parish, and no public carriage. There are three small bridges, 
and few fences. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built at a remote 
period.  It is conveniently situated, and in tolerable repair. It 
contains 390 sittings : a central seat is reserved for the poor, suffi- 
cient to accommodate 8. The manse was built in 1804, and is a 
good substantial house. The glebe may be estimated at L. 18 
per annum; and the stipend is 15 chalders, half meal, half barley, 
with L. 8, 6s. 8d. for communion elements. There is no chapel of 
any kind, missionary, nor catechist. The average attendance at 
church is good, but very variable, in consequence of the popula- 
tion being much scattered. On a fine day, summer or winter, there 
are not many empty seats, — on a bad day, there may not be 100 
people present. The average is probably 250 ; and the commu- 
nicants above 300, nearly the whole adult population. There 
was a religious Association for some years, but it has fallen asleep. 
There are now four annual collections for the four schemes of the 
General Assembly, yielding from L. 3 to L. 4 each. 

Education. — There is only one parochial school, and no other 
regular school ; but in the remote parts of the parish, in the win- 
ter months, it is common for families to unite together, as con- 
venience permits, and employ a teacher ; it is thus chiefly that 
the children are taught ; and, considering the insufficiency of the 
means, it is surprising how well and how generally the education 
of the young is advanced. Maternal care and assiduity are the 
chief substitutes for better opportunities. The parochial school- 
master enjoys the maximum salary, with the legal accommodation, 
and fees charged from Is. and Is. 6d. a month, according to the 
branches taught, which are all ordinary ones, with Latin occasion- 
ally, — and amounting to about L. 15 per annum. So far as known, 
there is not one person between six and fifteen years of age who 
cannot read, and very few who cannot also write. Inabihty to do 
the one or the other is felt as a degradation. 

Library. — A parish library was instituted a few years ago, and 

proceeds slowly but progressively. It now contains 160 volumes. 

The reading disposition, however, is limited to a few. 

Friendli/ Societij. — k Friendly Society, for aid to the sick, was 

4 



BARR. 



413 



established in 1819, and has been of undoubted advantage, both 
in furnishing rehef, and in fostering the spirit of independence. 

Savings Bank. — A savings bank was also begun at the same 
time, and has proved of considerable benefit to servants and la- 
bourers, for whom it is exclusively designed. It has suffered, how- 
ever, from the pressure of the times within the last two or three 
years, and the sum now deposited does not exceed L. 150. 

Foo7' and Parochial Funds. — The poor are very sedulously at- 
tended to, and well provided for, partly by the session, and partly 
by the charitable and humane. Their average number is 18, in- 
cluding children. Of this number, however, not more than six or 
eight names appear on the session-roll ; and the allowance to them 
is very variable, running from 2s. 6d. to 6s. or 8s. a month, and 
sometimes, when an attendant is to be employed, 15s. or 16s a month. 
The collections to meet these and other usual demands amount 
to about L. 26 a-year, with L. 25 from- the absent heritors, of vo- 
luntary contribution ; and mortcloth-money and penalties, amount- 
ing to about L. 2 more ; and seats in the church, yielding L. 10 
more. One donation of L. 50 was recently made by a lady anony- 
mously. The gifts of the session are never bestowed but as a help 
or partial support. The pauper is made to understand that he 
must look to friends if he have them, and to the parish at large ; 
and the parishioners at large having the same understanding, give 
at their door, or send assistance, according to disposition or abiHty. 
There is some reluctance, in the first instance, to be enrolled in the 
list of paupers ; but the feeling rapidly dies away, when the person 
has once stooped to the name ; and friends and relatives are simi- 
larly affected. It is hard to say, however, whether the disposition 
among the poor to ask for parochial relief is advancing or decreasing. 

Fair. — There is an annual fair which was originally designed for 
country business, but, from changes in the habits of the people, it 
has now no very assignable object, and continues more from use and 
wont than for any distinct purpose. 

Inns. — There are 4 inns in the village, and 1 in a remote part 
of the parish. 

Fuel. — Fuel is not a very expensive article. Peat is abundant, 
and used in all the distant and higher parts of the parish, whilst 
the village and neighbourhood consume coal obtained at a mode- 
rate expense, on the water of Girvan, eight miles, and costing 
6s. 6d. a single horse cart, including carriage. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

On this head it may be stated, that .the parish has undergone 



414 



AYRSHIRE. 



little alteration since the last Statistical Account was drawn up, 
further than that it has advanced with the rest of the country, 
though not to the same degree, in the general cultivation of mind 
nd manners. The farmer is now a man of greater intelligence 
and larger capital than formerly. He receives a better education, 
and has more time for reading, reflection, and that intercourse of 
life which sharpens the understanding. One important improve- 
ment to this and all similar pastoral parishes consists in the culti- 
vation and training of a good breed of sheep-dogs. By this means, 
the writer is credibly informed, that the same work in gathering 
and separating flocks of sheep can be more effectually done, and 
with less injury to the sheep, by one man and a good dog, than by 
many men and many dogs, whom it was formerly, about forty or 
fifty years ago, the custom to assemble on all great gatherings. 
This improvement is of more consequence than can be easily 
calculated, being to the store-farmer what the thrashing-machine 
is to the agricultural, or the steam-engine to the manufacturer. 

In some respects, this has been a neglected and ill-used parish. 
It is in extreme want of roads, and the conversion-money is by no 
means judiciously and properly applied. By increased facilities 
of communication for the obtaining of lime and soil ; and by an 
increase of plantations for the raising of wood for home use, much 
advantage would undoubtedly accrue to the tenantry, and the pro- 
prietors themselves ultimately ; but it is feared the law of entail 
places a complete negative upon the distant prospective good. 

The lower classes do not labour under any grievances, but such 
as are incidental to their lot and to humanity. The want of re- 
gular occupation in winter is a hardship almost unavoidable ; their 
own ignorance and folly often prove a greater and almost equally 
irremediable evil, — especially their indisposition to work except at 
a wage which the profits of farming will not allow. The great 
spring, however, to human industry and the true vital principle of 
happiness and comfort is religion, and much has been done and is 
doing to secure this grand element, and make the heart feel the 
power of personal godliness, the great softener of human ills and 
promoter of human good. Much might yet be done by an improve- 
ment of the school system, especially the establishment of a school 
library, the reading of books to be allowed as premiums, and by 
a large supply gratis, or cheap, of school-books to children whose 
parents often feel the burden of procuring the materiel of educa- 
tion more than the payment of the school fees.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. JOHN MILROY, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Situation and Boundaries. — The parish of Ballantrae lies in the 
southern extremity of Ayrshire, in the district of Carrick. It is 
bounded on the north and north-east by the parish of Colmonell ; 
on the east and south-east, by the parish of New Luce ; on the south, 
by that of Inch ; and on the west by Lochryan and the Irish sea. 
It is about 10 miles in length from north to south, and nearly as 
many from west to east. 

Name. — Its name is said to be Celtic, and signifies the town upon 
or above the shore, which is the actual situation of the town of 
Ballantrae. The ancient name of the parish was Kirkcudbright 
Inner tig; but in 1617, an act of Parliament was passed for remov- 
ing the parish church from the mouth of the river Tig to the town 
of Ballantrae, and hence the name of the town gradually became 
the name of the parish. 

Surface, Sc. — The surface is considerably diversified by hill and 
dale, being a succession of low ridges nearly parallel to each other, 
running from west to east, and in general rising in height as they 
recede from the coast. There are four such ridges, of which the 
highest is the third reckoning from the north. In this ridge, the 
highest hill is Beinerard, which is 1430 feet above the level of the 
sea. It was one of the signal stations in the late trigonometrical 
survey, and commands a very extensive and beautiful prospect, com- 
prehending the Isle of Man, the north-east of Ireland, Cantire, 
Ailsa, Arran, the Ayrshire coast as far north as the Cumbraes, 
the whole being terminated by the west Highland mountains in the 
distance, — and in another direction, the Dumfries-shire hills, the 
Cumberland and Westmoreland mountains, with the interjacent 
Sol way. 

Topographical Appearances. — The parish has upwards of ten 
miles of sea coast, but the whole of the shore is bold and rocky. 



416 



AYRSHIRK. 



with the exception of between two and three miles of it, near the town 
of Ballantrae, which is flat and sandy. The town or village is situated 
on the north bank of the Stinchar, about half a mile from its mouth, 
and nearly opposite to the opening between the Mull of Cantire and 
the north of Ireland. The sea in every other direction is land- 
locked, but in that the nearest land is America. In high winds 
from the westward, the beach is exposed to the full fury of the 
Atlantic, and nothing can exceed the grandeur of the sea view ; 
while in the serene evenings of summer, nothing can be softer, 
more placid, or more beautiful than the same expanse of sea, often 
with scarcely even a ripple to break its glassy surface. 

There are three lighthouses visible from the village, viz. that on 
Corsewall Point, Wigtonshire, that on the Irish coast almost oppo- 
site to the village, and that on Pladda to the northward. 

Hydrography. — The only river of any size in Ballantrae, is the 
Stinchar. It has its source in the parish of Barr, flows south-west, 
crosses Colmonell, forms the northern boundary of part of Ballan- 
trae, then flows through it for about three miles, and discharges it- 
self after a course of about thirty miles into the Irish sea. It is 
broad and shallow, like all other mountain streams, is speedily 
flooded, and soon again subsides. It receives the Tig from the 
south-east, which is also a mountain stream of the same character, 
but smaller. The App is a smaller stream still, about four miles 
south from the Stinchar, and flows westward through Glenapp 
into Lochryan. None of these streams is navigable even for the 
smallest distance. 

The fish which frequent these streams are the common trout, 
the sea-trout, the salmon, and the par. Salmon go up the Stinchar, 
in great numbers, to spawn in October and November ; and the 
young return to the sea again in April and the beginning of May. 
The salmon fishery at the mouth of the Stinchar, opens in the be- 
ginning of February, and closes in the middle of September, but 
the time both of opening and closing the river is considered too 
early. Though it opens in February, the tacksmen of the fishery 
never think of putting a net in water till the 20th April, and even 
then not one fish in twenty is worth keeping, and at the time of 
closing, the fish are quite as good as at any previous time, save per- 
haps the end of July and the month of August. If the river were 
kept closed till the beginning of April, and not closed again till the 
beginning of October, it would be a better arrangement, the Stm- 
char being considered a very late river. The rent of the fishery is 



BALLANTllAE. 



417 



L. 210 a-year. A market is found for the fish chiefly in Ayr and 
Kilmarnock. 

Climate, i-c. — The climate is rather moist, as might be expect- 
ed from the proxiipity of an expanse of between twenty-five and 
thirty leagues of sea ; but it is very mild. The prevailing winds are 
from the westward or some modification of west, and in conse- 
quence the air is often loaded with saline particles caught up in the 
process of evaporatipn. The highest winds are from the west and 
north-west, the most rainy from the south, south-west, and south- 
east. The temperature is never very low, and but seldom very 
high, being in both cases moderated by the sea-breeze. There 
has not been a week of continued frost within the last four years. 
Snow very seldom lies for more than a day on the low grounds near 
the coast. The finest weather is commonly in the beginning of 
May and in the end of July, or beginning of August. The air ap- 
pears to be salubrious, for there is a number of very old people in 
the parish, and the inhabitants in general are of a robust make 
and hale florid complexion, quite free of any peculiar disease, and 
generally not much visited with the ordinary diseases that assail 
our nature. 

Soil, Sc. — The soil is mostly of a light dry gravelly nature, 
sandy near the shore, and requires a good deal of rain to make it 
yield good crops. The best soil is that of the holms on the banks of 
the Stinchar and the other streams. But cultivation is profitably ex- 
tended up to the foot of the highest hills, where there are luxuriant 
crops of oats, and barley, or bear. Lime has been applied to the 
surface of the hills, 800 feet above the level of the sea. It has de- 
stroyed the heather, and both increased the quantity and improved 
the quality of the pasturage. No lime is found within Ballantrae, 
but there is abundance of it in the neighbouring parish of Colmo- 
nell, at the distance of from two to ten miles from the various 
farms in the parish. 

Woods, Sfc. — From various causes, the climate is considered un- 
favourable to the growth of wood ; yet at a former period, there 
must have been a large quantity of it in the parish, for in the mo- 
rasses among the hills a good deal of it, chiefly oak, ash, and birch, 
is still found imbedded in peat-moss. And within the recollec- 
tion of old people, the coast was much more fringed with copse- 
wood than at present. On the south bank of the Stinchar and of 
the Tig, and on the north bank of the App, there is a good deal 
of natural wood, some of which, particularly on the Tig, is valu- 



418 



AYRSHIRE. 



able as timber, but a large portion is coppice or brush-wood. Till 
comparatively a late date, there does not seem to have been mucli 
planted in the parish. About nineteen years ago, however, seve- 
ral considerable belts and clumps of plantation were laid down by 
John Donaldson, Esq. of Auchairne, around his house and on 
other parts of his property, which have thriven- uncommonly well, 
and fully prove that although on the coast, or where there is much 
exposure to the western wind, wood may not thrive, yet neither 
the soil nor the climate is unfavourable to its growth in a different 
situation. Other proprietors have also planted more or less ; and 
last season the Earl of Orkney, who lately became a proprietor in the 
parish, laid down very extensive plantations both in Glen App, 
and on the ridge to the north of the glen, most of which will pro- 
bably thrive as well as those laid down nineteen years ago. And 
nineteen years hence, the face of the country may be as well co- 
vered with wood, as lately it appeared the reverse. The number 
of acres under wood, natural or planted, may now be fairly stated 
at 370. 

II. — Civil History. 

Antiquities. — It appears from the act of Parliament, authorizing 
the removal of the church, that the town of Ballantrae was erect- 
ed into a burgh of barony before 1617. Respecting the old Cas- 
tle of Ardstinchar, the seat of a branch of the Bargany family, 
and the state of society in the district of Carrick when it was inha- 
bited, amusing and interesting information will be found in Pit- 
cairn's History of the House of Kennedy. 

Land-oioners.—-T\\e landed property in the parish is divided 
among thirteen proprietors, two of whom are noblemen. The small- 
est of these proprietors has a yearly rental greatly above L. 50. 
Only one of them resides in the parish during the whole year, but 
several reside in it during a part of the summer and autumn. 

Parochial Registers.— T\ie parochial registers do not reach far- 
ther back than 1744, and contain only marriages and baptisms. 
They are not in a good state of preservation till near the end of 
the century; since then they have been kept with greater accuracy 
and care, though still there is no register of the deaths. 

III. — Population. 
The total population of the parish in 1831 was 1506. These 
are comprehended in about 290 families, giving rather more than 
five persons to each family on an average. Of these families, about 
.108 are resident in the village of Ballantrae, making  popidation 



BALLANTRAE. 



419 



of 456. The average number of marriages for the last four years, 
is rather above 9; of births, rather above 43; both exclusive of Dis- 
senters, who have their own registers. When the former Statistical 
Account was drawn up, there were only 770 inhabitants in the 
parish, so that the population has nearly doubled in forty years. 
The increase of population is entirely to be attributed to the great 
additional quantity of land brought into cultivation, which has given 
increased means of subsistence, and required not only more hands 
to cultivate it, but also more tradesmen and shopkeepers to supply 
them with implements, clothing, and the necessaries of life. 

Character of the People. Sc. — The people, with a few exceptions, 
are comfortably fed, clothed, and lodged. They have an abun- 
dant supply of excellent fish, almost all the year round, and possess 
as many of the comforts of their station as those of their degree 
in most other parishes. They are so contented with their situa- 
tion, and so attached to their native place, that few of them leave 
it but with great reluctance. Fifty years ago, smuggling prevailed 
to a great extent, but for many years past there has been no such 
thing. Poaching, both in game and in salmon-fishing, is also dis- 
appearing. In general, they are a moral and religious people. 

The number of illegitimate children in the last three years is 10. 

IV. — Industry. 

By far the greater number of families in the parish is employed 
in agriculture, either directly as cultivators, or indirectly as labour- 
ers, or tradesmen supplying implements of agriculture. There 
are a few families employed in weaving cottons for manufacturers 
in Glasgow ; and a good many are tradesmen at one season, and 
fishermen at another. 

Bate of Wages. — The price of labour for the best hands is 
from Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. a-day in summer without food, and from 
Is. to Is. 4d. a-day in winter. Some who constantly require 
labourers agree with them for Is. 4d. a-day both summer and 
winter, and others for even less; but in both these cases it 
is understood that the labourer is to have constant employ- 
ment, if not for a whole year, at least for a very considerable 
portion of it. Women get 8d. a-day for field labour; joiners 
charge 2s. a-day ; masons 2s. 6d. without food. An iron plough 
costs about L.4, a harrow L. 1, 8s., a cart about L. 8, the shoeing 
of a horse about L. 1 a -year. ' A cottager's benefit varies from 
L. 19 to L. 23 a-year. Few men-servants reside in the farmers' 
famihes; those who do are generally young lads, and their wages 



420 



AYRSHIRE. 



are from L. 4 to L. 5, lOs. half-yearly. Female servants receive 
from L. '2 to L. 4, and experienced dairy-maids often L. 5 for the 
half year. 

Prices of Provisions. — The price of butcher-meat is about 4d. 
per lb. of 16 oz. ; of butter 8d. per do. ; fowls Is. a piece; chickens 4d. 
do. ; cheese sweet milk 8s. 6d. per stone of 24lbs. ; oatmeal about 
2s. 3d. per stone in retail; cod-fish from 8d. to Is. per stone of 
16 lbs. ; salmon-trout in May 7d. a lb., salmon in the beginning of 
June JOd. per do., in August 7d. per do., grilse in August 5d. per 
do. ; turbot 4d. per lb. 

Husbandry. — In all the principal farms, the dairy system is a 
good deal combined with the tillage system. On one farm, there 
are above seventy cows kept during the whole year, — on each of two 
others above forty, on several others thirty, and from that down- 
wards i and these same farms raise annually as much farm produce 
as any others in the parish. About 5000 stones of sweet milk 
cheese are made every year in Ballantrae. 

In tillage husbandry, the seven-shift rotation is usually practised, 
i.e. supposing the land to be in pasturage, there is 1. a .crop of 
oats; 2. a green crop; 3. a crop of wheat or barley; 4. a hay 
crop of rye-grass and clover; and then pasturage for three years. 
Of late bone-dust is made use of to raise crops of turnips, which 
are generally eaten off by sheep, and furrow-draining is practised 
to a considerable extent. 

The length of leases is commonly nineteen years. All the farm- 
steadings recently built are good ; the others admit of considerable 
improvement. 

The total number of acres in the parish may be estimated at 
between 24,000 and 25,000. Of these about 7000 are arable ; 
400 of the arable are worth L. 2 an acre per annum ; 2000 
more are worth L. 1, and the rest are worth from 8s. to iOs. per 
annum. The land not arable, being chiefly moor pasture, may be 
considered worth 2s. 6d. per acre a-year. The gross rental of the 
land in the parish is L. 7456 a-year. 

Fisheries. — Besides the salmon-fishery, which we have already 
mentioned, there is a white fishery chiefly of cod and turbot. It 
commences about the 10th of January, and ends before the 1st 
of April. . A great many herrings are also caught some seasons. 
The white fishery employs sixteen boats with four men in each, and 
each boat takes to the value of from L. 35 to L. 40 a season. Last 
season 1836 each boat took fully L. 40, which gives L. 640 



BALLANTRAE. 



421 



as tlie produce of last fishing season. The cost of the boat may 
be about L. 10, of the sail L. 2, and of the nets about L. 1 each. 
The boat will last twelve or fifteen years, the nets not more than 
two years; but the boats often meet with accidents, and the nets 
are still oftener drifted out to sea by high winds, and either seri- 
ously injured or altogether lost. From eight to twenty nets are 
used by each boat. 

Produce. — The gross annual produce raised in the parish may 
be taken at very nearly as under, viz. 

4055 bolls of 8 bushels oats, at 17s. 7id. per boll fiar price. L. 3573 9 4| 
995 do. of 4 bushels wheat, at L. 1, 16s. 2id. per quarter, 901 11 9

The grain is estimated at the last fiar prices ; the bushels are

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Means of Communicatio7i, — There is no market-town, and but. 
one village in the parish. It is around the church, and consists of 
eighty-four houses. The chief market-town for the farm produce 
of the parish is Girvan, distant twelve miles and a-half to the north. 
Stranraer distant seventeen miles south, is another good market- 
town, but in it much less business from the parish is done. The 
roads to both towns are now excellent. The length of turnpike 
roads in the parish is eleven miles in one direction, and about five 
in another, and two in a third. A number of excellent parish roads 
branch out from these. 

There is a post-office in the village. The mail from Ireland 
to Glasgow passes northward every day at six o'clock in the even- 
ing, from Glasgow southward about one o'clock in the morning. 
Since October last 1835 the mails have been conveyed by a two- 
horse mail coach ; before, they were conveyed in mail gigs. For se- 
veral years, the steam-boat from Stranraer to Glasgow has called 
at Ballantrae, both in going and returning, during the summef 



422 



AYRSHIRE. 



months; and during last summer, two others plied between Glasgow 
and Stranraer, touching at Ballantrae, so that there was a convey- 
ance from Ballantrae to Glasgow by steam three times a-week, and 
as often back again. It is understood that the same arrangement 
is to be continued by at least two of the boats. 

There is an annual ploughing-match in the parish, at which up- 
wards of thirty ploughs compete. Four years ago an annual cattle 
shew of dairy stock, viz. Ayrshire cows and bulls. Galloway do. do., 
young beasts, both Ayrshire and Galloway, cross breeds between 
the Ayrshire and Galloway, horses, foals, rams, and pigs, — was set 
agoing in Ballantrae, and went on with great spirit. It has now 
been extended to the three parishes of Barr, Colmonell, and Bal- 
lantrae, imder the name of The Stinchar Association. The shew is 
held in each parish in rotation. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The ruins of the church at Innertig are 
still standing. The present parish church is situated in the north- 
west corner of the parish in the village, but by far the greater part 
of the population is comprehended within a distance of four miles 
from it. There are, however, several families eight miles from it, 
and others in a different direction, nine or ten. It is a neat church, 
affording accommodation for nearly 600, and was built in 1819. 
There are no sittings in it absolutely free, but there are fifty placed 
at the disposal of the kirk-session, a few of which are let at Is. a 
sitting for a year, the rest are occasionally occupied by whoever 
chooses. The manse was built in 1736, and, though now a cen- 
tury old, is still in a good state of repair. The glebe, together 
with a manse and church, built at the " Laird of Barganye's lairge 
and sumptuous chargis, was voluntarilye designed to the minister 
serveing the cure at ye kirk of Ballintrae, out of ye saide Lairde 
of Barganye's awin proper landis and heretage without anye con- 
straynte," when the church was removed to the town of Ballintrae 
in 1617, in consequence of which the patronage was retained in 
the family of Bargany, and remains in it still. The glebe consists 
of between 6 and 7 acres, nearly two of which are grass glebe, in- 
capable of cultivation. The stipend was augmented in 1826, at 
which time 46 bolls 2 firlots, 3 pecks, 2 lippies of oatmeal, 16 bolls, 
3.998 bushels imperial of bear, and L. 186, 17s. 3|d. were grant- 
ed. The teinds are now exhausted. The value of the glebe may 
be estimated at between L. 10 and L. 12 yearly. The number of 
families that attend church is about 260, and there are about 30 
-Dissenting or Catholic families in the parish. There is no Dissent-

ing or Catholic place of worship in it. Divine service is generally 
well attended. The number of communicants is from 430 to 440. 
The parish was disjoined from the presbytery of Ayr, and annexed 
to that of Stranraer in 1699. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The amount of the ordinary church 
collections, &amp;c for the behoof of the poor, is within a few shillings 
of L. 50 yearly. The number of poor at present on the roll is 14 ; 
but many othei-s receive occasional relief as circumstances seem to 
require. The highest payment to a pauper is L. 6, 10s. a-year, 
the lowest L. 1, 1 5s. There is no assessment, voluntary or other- 
wise. The ordinary collections, &amp;c generally suffice for this very 
moderate allowance. A considerable source both of annoyance and 
expense to the kirk-session is the passing of paupers chiefly Irish 
who are unable to travel. The great road from Glasgow to Port- 
patrick runs for eleven miles through the parish, and hence there 
are many applications to be passed southwards, but not one toviards 
the north. Paupers, if forwarded at all, must be forwarded twelve 
miles. 

A few years ago, a benevolent lady of the name of Caddall be- 
queathed the sum of L. 4500, and 1 5 acres of land, to build and 
endow a chapel and school in Glenapp in connection with the 
Established Church, and also to found a bursary for a student pre- 
paring for the ministry. The trustees whom she nominated have 
set the school and the bursary in operation, have selected the land 
for the glebe, and intend to proceed with the chapel as soon as the 
funds, after the necessary building and inclosing, will afford a de- 
cent competency to a clergyman. Persons of the names of But- 
ters and Caddall are to be preferred. Were this chapel opened, 
the parish would have church accommodation ample, even beyond 
its present need. The upper end of Glenapp is four miles from 
the parish church, and the lower end eight ; the chapel is intend- 
ed to be near the middle of the glen. 

Education. — There are four schools in the parish, three of which 
are endowed. The parish school has the maximum legal endow- 
ment ; and, besides, the interest of L. 400 annually, to educate 
poor children, two-thirds of whom are to be nominated by thepatron 
of the parish, and the remainder by the kirk-session. The amount 
of fees actually received by the schoolmaster is about L. 16 a year, 
of the other emoluments arising from the school L. 48, of the whole 
L. 64. The school in Glenapp has L. 25 of annual salary; and 
the other has a small annual endowment of about T.. 6. The ek- 



4S4 



AYIISIIIIIE. 



mentary branches are taught in all these schools : and in some of 
them, book-keeping, mensuration, geography, Latin, and Greek. 
When the schools were last examined February 1836, there were 
96 males and 47 females attending these four schools, making in 
all 143, which may be pretty near the average number of scholars. 

There are none between the ages of six and ■fifteen who cannot 
read, more or less; there are but few at fifteen who cannot write, 
and I know of only two above fifteen who cannot read. The ex- 
pense of being taught reading is lOd. per month of four weeks; 
reading and writing. Is.; reading, writing, and arithmetic, Is. '2d.; 
Latin and Greek, Is. 4d. The schools are in general well taught, 
and the people seem tolerably sensible of the importance of edu- 
cation. 

Library. — About a year anda-half ago, a subscription library was 
comriienced, to which there are now about thirty subscribers. The 
books as yet are not numerous, about 100 volumes, but they are much 
in request. Besides these, there are two copies of Chambers' Jour- 
nal, four copies of Chambers' Information for the People, four co- 
pies of Chambers' Historical Newspaper, one copy of the Penny 
Magazine, and one of the Saturday Magazine, all given by Mr 
George Oliver of Manchester, circulating through the parish in 
addition to newspapers. 

Inns, 8fc. — There are a good inn and 5 public-houses in the vil- 
lage of Ballantrae to a population of 456. They are greatly more 
numerous than is required, and are not favourable to the morals of 
the people in their neighbourhood. There is but one other public 
house in the parish. 

Fuel. — In the higher parts of the parish, peat is the chief fuel. 
Abundance of it is found among the hills ; and at one time it was 
almost the sole fuel used in the parish ; but now two-thirds of the 
people use coal, owing to the distance that peat must be driven, 
and the unwillingness of proprietors to allow it to be cut. Coal is 
obtained at Girvan, a distance of twelve miles and a-half from the 
village. It costs Is. 4d. per creel at Girvan. A horse draws five 
of these creelsj and there are two tolls to the village, three if you 
pass it, so that a cart of coal at Ballantrae costs 10s. lOd. at the 
very least. Such a cart contains five-eighths of a ton. Sometimes 
coal is brought from Gir\'an by sea, but farmers and others who 
have bulky articles to carry to market, find it cheaper to bring back 
coal with their own horses. Fuel is one of the most expensive ar- 
ticles of house-keeping in this district.

Miscellaneous Observations. 
When the former Statistical Account was written, the popula- 
tion of the parish was 770 ; now it is upwards of 1506. There 
were then 190 dwelling-houses in it, now there are 290. There 
were then 77 houses containing 300 people in the village ; now 
there are in it 84, giving a population of 456. Then, the annual 
number of births in the parish was 18; now it is upwards of 43, ex- . 
elusive of those in 30 Dissenting or Catholic families. Formerly, the 
real rent of the parish, yearly, was " believed to be" little short of 
L.2000 Sterling; now it is above L.7400 a-year. Formerly the 
rent of farms was from L. 10 to L. 115 per annum; now it is from 
L. 10 to L. 450. Formerly a cottager's benefit was from L. 10 to 
L. 15 a-year ; now it is from L. 19 to L. 23. Formerly the salmon 
fishery was rented L. 80 a-year, now it is L.210. At the time of 
the former Statistical Account, salmon sold at ld. per lb. ; now it 
sells from 6d. to 1 Od. per do. ; cod then sold at from 4d. to 6d. per 
stone, now sells at from 8d. to Is. Beef and mutton sold then at 
about 2d per lb., now sell at from 4d. to 6d. Fowls were then 6d. 
each, now Is. ; chickens then 2d. now 4d. The stipend of Ballan- 
trae was then L.500 Scots of money, and 3 chalders of victual ; 
now it is 46 bolls of oatmeal, 16| bolls of bear, and L. 186, 17s. 
3 jd. The school salary then was L. 6 Sterling a-year, now it is 
L.34, 4s. 

Formerly, there was no person connected with the law, not even 
a constable op sheriff's officer in the parish, — neither is there at 
present. Formerly, there was no Justice of Peace in the parish, 
now there are two ; and a Justice of Peace Court is held in the 
village every two months. Formerly, there was no surgeon or 
physician within a dozen of miles ; for the last four years, a sur- 
geon has resided in the village of Ballantrae.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

REV. DAVID LANDSBOROUGH, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Boundaries, 4'c. — The parish of Stevenston derives 
its name from Stephen Lockhart, who settled in it in the twelfth 
century; his father having about 1170 obtained a grant of the 
whole parish from Richard Morville, Lord of Cuninghame and 
Constable of Scotland. Its greatest length is about 5 miles, 
from Saltcoats harbour to Irvine Bar ; and its greatest breadth is 
about 3 miles. It contains about 6 square miles ; or about 3182 
Scotch acres. It is bounded on the north by Ardrossan and Kil- 
winning ; on the south by the Frith of Clyde ; on the west by Ar- 
drossan ; and on the east by Kilwinning, and by the river Gafnock, 
which separates it, for about three miles, from the parish of Irvine ; 
and on the south-east, by the confluence of the Garnock and Irvine, 
separating it from that part of the parish of Dundonald, which, by 
an act of last General Assembly, has been erected into a new pa- 
rish, quoad spirihialia, called Fullerton. 

Though the surface is varied, it in no place rises to any great 
height. From Saltcoats there is a gradual acclivity to Croak's- 
-well, on the northern boundary, towards Dairy, where there is 
the highest ground in the parish, 308 feet above the level of 
the sea at high water. At Castle-hill, on the eastern boundary, 
there are two eminences of considerable beauty, now surmounted 
by thriving plantations, forming a contrast to the sterile sand-hills 
in their neighbourhood. These sand-hills occupy about 1200 
acres of the south-eastern part of the parish, commencing at Ste- 
venston burn-foot, stretching along the shore to Irvine Bar, and 
extending probably more than a mile inland. From Saltcoats to 
Muirside, on the way to Kilwinning, there is a flat tract betwixt 
t}ie highway and the sea, part of which is rich loamy ground,

and part of it little more than sea-sand. The upper part of the 
parish is stiff clay. 

There is a tradition that the Garnock, which now falls into th© 
sea in union with the Irvine, in olden time, took a westerly direc- 
tion, by Bog and Ardeer, and Stevenston, and fell into the sea op- 
posite to Sea Bank. We have little doubt of the truth of this tradi- 
tion. It accounts for the origin of the sand-hills ; as we find si- 
milar sand-hills in other places, formed at the mouths of rivers by 
the blowing of sand brought down by the stream ; and the drift of 
sand here is almost always from the west, the quarter in which we 
suppose the mouth of the river, of old, to have been. It receives 
countenance from the great facility with which the river might still 
be made to flow in what, we believe, was its ancient course; — from the 
soil of part of this flat tract, which we regard as its ancient channel, 
being a mixture of moss, water-worn gravel, sand, and shells; — and 
from another small portion of land in the same course still retain- 
ing the name of Insch, the Gaelic term for island ; once probably 
insulated by the river ; but now unvisited by the smallest stream. 
The tradition receives some countenance from the fact, that a si- 
milar change, though on a smaller scale, is well known to have 
taken place on the course of Stevenston burn, which, instead of 
falling into the sea, as it does now, to the south of Stevenston, 
flowed in a westerly direction behind what is now Bogle Mart 
Street, and through the green fields of Sea Bank, falling into the 
sea in the neighbourhood of Saltcoats. And it is no small con- 

 It is well known in Stevenston that several lives were lost, and much injury- 
done, by the drowning of a coal-pit betwixt Saltcoats and Stevenston ; but some 
ascribe the catastrophe to a high tide, and others to the flooding of Stevenston burn. 
On conversing lately with a respectable gentleman, born in Stevenston more than 
eighty years ago, and whose father, about 1763, was tacksman of the coal-works, 
we learned that there were two pits drowned ; one of them by the tide, and the other 
by the burn, though he knew not the date of either of these mournful events. The 
one which was overflowed by the tide was at the sits near Saltcoats. At a much 
later period than the one we speak of, the tide encroached farther on the land. In 
January 1 796, during a high tide, the sea was so deep on the highway from Sea Bank 
gate to Saltcoats, that a person told me that he was obliged to walk all the way on the 
top of the wall. The pit of which we speak was between the road and the sea, and, 
as it was considered in danger during the time of high spring-tides, two persons were 
set to watch, and if necessary to give alarm to those who were at work below. On 
one occasion, the watchers, having found the charms of an alehouse too powerful foj' 
them, forsook their post ; and the sea having risen to an unusual height, overflow- 
ed the pit mouth, and, rushing down into the gulf below, gave notice to the col- 
liers of their danger when it was too late ; and of the six who were at work, not one 
escaped to tell the mournful tale. As the pit filled, the imprisoned air forced a way 
for itself at various places ; and the water was propelled upwards like so vciimy jets 
d'eaii. The pillars that supported the roof giving way, the ground subsided, and con- 
tinucs to be called the sits; and it used till lately to be covered all winter with water. 

But a similar catastrophe liappened to another pit betwixt Sea Bank and Steven- 
ston. At that ti mC; Stevenston burn flowed down ix hollow still evident in Sea Bctnk.

firmation of the truth of the tradition, that boat anchors and frag- 
ments of boats have been dug up in marshy ground near Ardeer, 
in the Hne in which the Garnock is supposed to have flowed; and 
till the great goat or drain was made in that low tract, there was 
a continuous line of little lochs, or as they are called dubbs which, 
for a length of time after the river had found a new channel, would 
make the sand-hills an inscli or island. We know a case perfectly 
similar in Galloway, where the Ken changed its course some hun- 
dred years ago, and where a large and fertile holm, intercepted 
betwixt the new channel of the silver stream, and the remaining 
dubhs of the old channel, still retains the name of the muckle isle, 
and continues to be a part of the parish of Dairy, though now cut 
off from it by the river. A similar change has taken place on the 
course of the Doon near Ayr. 

In the map of Cuninghame, published by Bleau in 1654, but 
prepared by Pont nearly half a century before, — and probably, in 
some respects, copied from a map more ancient still, — instead of 
finding the Lugton joining the Garnock, and the Garnock and Irvine 
uniting near Irvine Bar, we find the three streams falling into the 
sea at a considerable distance from each other. The course of 
the Irvine is the same as it is now. Far to the west, however, the 
Garnock, in lonely pride, winds its way to the sea through the hills 
of sand ; and the Lugton, as unsocial as its more powerful neigh- 
bours, loses itself in the mighty ocean, about midway betwixt the 
Irvine and the Garnock. 

But there is not only tradition for the change, but for the cause 
of the change ; and though those who lived at the time and wit- 
nessed the event, might be deceived as to the cause, they could 
not be mistaken as to the fact. St Winning, we are told, had 
gone to fish — not men but trout. The Garnock trouts, however, 
were not complaisant enough to allow themselves to be caught ; 
and the angling saint became so greatly incensed, that, dreading 
his ire, trout and stream fled before him, seeking the sea by a new- 
channel. We may laugh at a Popish miracle to effect a change, 

grounds, and to this day containing water, known under the name of the old hum, 
along the side of which, when there were no inclosures, was the church road from 
Saltcoats to Stevenston. No danger was dreaded to the pits from the burn, in its 
meandering progress to the sea. But in the time of a great flood in the burn, the 
mill-dam above Stevenston burst ; and the impetuous torrent overflowing the banks, 
made its way into the coal-pit at no great distance, and several colliers who were at 
work at the time were drowned. In changing the course of the burn, it was made 
to flow in such a line as to form the boundary betwixt the estates of Ardeer and Sea- 
Bank;

for which a flood in the river would better account ; but the tra- 
dition strengthens our belief in the reality of the change, while 
it carries it back to a dark and distant age. 

Whatever may have been the changes in the course of the 
river, there is reason to think that the sea at a remoter period over- 
flowed what is now occupied by the sand-hills, and washed the 
base of that rocky ridge, which, commencing at Saltcoats, is very 
evident at Sea-Bank, and forms the high ground at the church 
and manse, and also at Ardeer. In proof of this, we may men- 
tion, that sea shells were lately found in sandy gravel, in digging a 
deep grave in the churchyard ; though we have to regret that they 
were not shewn to us. We have ourselves found in deep hollows 
formed by the wind among the sand-hills, about a mile from the 
sea, abundance of sea shells, chiefly consisting of Turbo littoreus and 
Mactra subtruncata. We have seen fine specimens of Pecten 
maximus found in perfect preservation twenty-two feet below the 
surface, when sinking for coal in the flat sandy common to the 
west of the sand-hills. And in several places of the same field, 

 It is quite a common occurrence in sinking for coal in any part of the coal-field, 
from Saltcoats to Misk and Bogend, after passing through a bed of sand, varying in 
depth from 5 to 25 or 30 feet, to come to a stratum of clay, and to find on the sur, 
face of the clay abundance of recent shells. A list of about 70 species of these sub- 
fossil shells was made out, but we need insert only those not found in a recent state 
on the shore, viz. 

Solen legumen Crassina minima Patella parva 

Mactra truncata Nucula minima Cemoria Flemingi 

Tellina approxima Modiola papuana Fusus lamellosus 

Crassina ovata albicostata' Corbula nucleus 

Since the above sentence was written, we have had the pleasure of picking up 
abundance of these shells, where they are boring the rock at Ardeer or Stevenston 
quarry. There, the shells are only 3 feet under the green sward. At this depth, there 
is a bed of coarse sea-sand, mixed with Turbo litloreus, &amp;c. &amp;c. the whelks and lim- 
pets and cockles being sound and entire. 

Under this bed of gravel and sand and shells, there is a stratum of solid till or 
slate-clay, 10 or 12 feet thick, overlying the beautiful sandstone of the quarry. 
This schistus is perforated in innumerable places, to the depth of 3 or 6 inches by 
Pholas crispata or the Borer, in the same manner as the progeny, probably, of these 
venerable Borers are at the present day piercing the same rock, in the sea at Saltcoats, 
The bore is fully an inch in diameter. The shell stiU occupies the mouth of the perfora- 
tion, and, though now frail, it is distinctly marked by its waved ridges and longitu- 
dinal furrows, and the groove running from the hinge to the margin. But what is 
much more wonderful; at the bottom of the holes which the Pholas has bored 
there is a matted tuft of sea-weed, Ulva i7iesiinalis}, not petrified; not con- 
verted into peat — not rotten — but retaining its sap and form, and texture and 
reticulations, and even its pale green colour  This is not a little surprising. Sir 
William Hooker, to whose kindness, on many occasions, we have been indebted, and 
to whom we sent specimens, says that we are correct in the name ; and that it could 



• As we are not well acquainted with sub-fossil shells, the names have been kind- 
ly furnished to us by James Smith, Esq. of Jordanhill, who has paid much attention 
to the conchology of the newer tertiary formations.

where the wind, aided by the rabbits, had made deep hollows 
in the sandy soil, we lately observed a thin stratum of peat some 
feet beneath the green sward, which, on examination, proved moss 
formed of sea-weed, Rotalia Beccarii-perversus being still fresh on 
the surface]; and the leaves of Zostera marina being still distin- 
guishable. On breaking up the peat, we found that it contained 
some sea shells in tolerable preservation, and we could easily dis- 
tinguish Lucina radula, Cardium losvigatum, and Astarte Scotica. 
From all these circumstances, there is every reason to conclude, 
that over that wide tract where the sand-hills now rise in sterile 
undulation, and over the grassy common to the west, where cows 
now feed, and rabbits burrow and frisk, and over the fertile farms 
of Bog and Bogend, the Atlantic once rolled its billows. 

Still, however, we can form but very vague conjectures respect- 
ing the various changes which must have taken place in former 
days, on this desolate part of the parish. It was not always 
so desolate, since the sea ceased to include it in its dominions. 
We discover at times traces of early cultivation, which have 
been long hid from the eye of man. In extending the quarry at 
Ardeer, and in sinking for coal, after removing some feet of 
pure sand, a stratum of rich alluvial soil has sometimes been reach- 
ed, which must have been under the plough ; as ridges are quite 
perceptible when a section of it is made ; and as horse-shoes of 
small size have at times been found, as well as hazel-nuts mingled 
with the soil. Here, then,, in days of yore, there must have been 

not have grown 5 feet under ground. From the shells then, and from the Ulva, the 
sea must have been there, though at a period too remote now to be ascertained. 
And though the sea is now about three quarters of a mile distant from the quarry, 
we can easily credit the tradition, that, in ancient times, vessels were accustomed to 
lie at anchor north of the quarry, and about the place where Ardeer House now stands. 
Indeed, from various phenomena that have come under our observation, we have the 
most thorough conviction, that, at a period not extremely remote, the half of this 
parish was overflowed by the sea. 

• Since we wrote the above, we have been told that, at sinking flio pit at Misk, 
after digging through many feet of sand, the workmen came to ridges evidently form- 
ed by the plough, and found fragments of earthen vessels; and, what was still 
more wonderful, found an entire tobacco-pipe, which pleased the colliers so much, 
that they insisted on having a whifF with it in their turn. This brings down the inun- 
dation of sand on part, at least, of the tract, to a more recent period than we would 
have imagined, unless we suppose that our forefathers were smokers of herbs or opium 
before the introduction of tobacco by Sir Walter Raleigh, in 1360. We are quite 
convinced that the sand-hills, in general, are of much longer standing; but as they 
travel from the west, and, as Misk is on the eastern boundary, it would be one of the 
last places covered. The progress of the sand at Misk is very perceptible, as it has 
risen in wreaths higher than the upper door-lintel of a house built there, no great 
number of years ago. It is the general belief, that the sandhills are becoming gra- 
dually lower ; and what they lose in height is spread, to their no small detriment, 
over the cultivated lands on the east.

not only the riches of harvest, but scenes of sylvan beauty. Here, 
instead of the timid rabbit burrowing in the sand, the sprightly 
deer must have bounded through the glade, and the wild bison 
Bos urusj must have at one time strayed ; for the antlers of the 
former, and the skull of the latter, have, within the remembrance 
of some still alive, been dug up in this barren tract. 

But barren though it now be, it is not devoid of objects of in- 
terest and curiosity. In exploring this wilderness lately, we ob- 
served in a section of one of the sand-hills laid bare by the wind, a 
dark coloured stratum of considerable thickness, which proved to 
be partly peat, and partly loam or vegetable mould. On closer 
inspection, we found that the stratum was separated from the su- 
perincumbent sand by what was like a rusty plate of iron about an 
eighth of an inch in thickness, and easily broken. At various places, 
this iron-like substance descended several feet into the sand, in 
hollow pillars tapering downwards like great icicles. These were 
generally firmer and thicker than the horizontal plates, and with 
more of a metallic lustre when broken. These were rather 
puzzling appearances, but we attempted to account for them as 
follows. 

There are still to be found among these sand-hills little lagoons 
Scotice lochans full of water, except during the heat of summer. 
The stratum of moss and mould has probably been formed in the 
progress of many years, by the partial decay in the case of the 
moss, and by the total decomposition in the case of the mould, — 
of the water plants that grew in these little ponds. The rusty 
plate, on examination, proved to be sand bound together by a de- 
position of oxide of iron ; and every person must have observed, 
that chalybeate waters deposit an ochreous matter on sand which 
they moisten. The total disappearance of the little ponds must 
have been owing either to the breaking down of the side of the 
hills, or to the hollows, in which they were formed, being filled up 
with drifted sand. The sand is constantly shifting, and conse- 
quently these iron-like plates are sometimes bare on the surface, 
and at other times deeply covered with sand. That the pillars 
are deposited by water impregnated with iron, is rendered likely by 
information that we lately received, that similar pillars are formed

Meteorologxj. — A register of the state of the barometer and ther- 
mometer, and of the wind and weather, has been kept for some 
yearst the Manse. It is marked once a day, and the hour of 
marking is 10 o'clock, a. m. The Manse is -only a mile from the 
sea, but it is placed on an elevated ridge above the village ; and as 
the thermometer is 9 feet above the surface of the ground, on the 
outside of a window facing the north, it is in all 72 feet above the 
level of the sea at high-water. It is occasionally marked at the 
hottest time of the day, and at the coldest time of the evening or 
morning. It has only once, for seven years, been observed so high 
as 84°, and only once so low as 18°. 

August 18, 1835, at 4 o'clock, p. m., the thermometer stood at 
82° in the sun, and at 72° in the shade. When water was pumped 
on it from the manse well, 22 feet deep, it fell to 50°. August 
12, 1835, at 8 o'clock in the evening, the thermometer in the 
open air stood at 56°; and when water was pumped on it from 
the well, it fell to 49°. 

February 19, 1835, at 7 o'clock in the morning, the thermo- 
meter at the bottom of the Turf-dike coal-pit, which is 408 feet 
deep, stood at 56°. When taken fifty yards into the workings, on 
the same level, where there is no current of air, it rose to 58°. In 
the running water at the bottom of the pit it stood at 54°. In the 
open air at the pit mouth it stood at 36° ; and when plunged into 
the canal it stood at 36°. 

July 8, 1835, 8 o'clock in the morning, the thermometer at the 
bottom of the Turf-dike coal-pit stood at 61°. In the open air 
at the pit-mouth it stood at 60°. 

December 29, 1836, at 6 o'clock in the morning, the thermo- 
meter at the bottom of the Turf-dike pit stood at 60°. When 
taken 300 yards into the workings it rose to 64° ; at the pit mouth 
it fell to 31°. When plunged into water in the open air, it rose 
to 32°. When plunged into water 300 yards into the workings be- 
low, it rose to 64°. 

December 28, 1836, at 6 o'clock in the morning, the thermo- 
meter at the bottom of No. 5 coal-pit stood at 61°. When taken 
300 yards into the workings it rose to 64° ; in the open air at the 
pit mouth it stood at 37°.

Average height of the barometer throughout year 1836, 29.49. 
On 13th October, the barometer if marked as low would have 
been 27.95. On 28th November, it was again 27.95 ; and on 
the 13th December, it was a third time lower than graduated, and 
would have been 27.93. 

On 31st October, the thermometer, half-past 7 o'clock in the 
morning, stood at 22°; and yet of this cold and variable and 
stormy year, 126 days are marked fine and very fine. 

Climate. — The climate of this parish, like that of the west coast 
in general, is certainly moist ; but the evils that might be expect- 
ed to arise from a moist and variable climate are in no small de- 
gree counteracted, not only by the lightness of the soil along the 
coast, which drinks up the frequent showers, — but also by the ge- 
neral mildness of the atmosphere from the proximity of the sea. 

The parish is healthy, and rather remarkable for the longevity 
of its inhabitants; for during the last twenty-six years 18 persons 
have died in it between 90 and 100 years of age ; and lately one 
female died in the 103d year of her age. 

That the climate is genial, and that the soil is kindly and fer- 
tile, is evident from the earliness of the harvest; and from the 
finer kinds of fruits ripening well in our gardens in the open air. 
Figs ripen in this neighbourhood even in unfavourable seasons. 
Peaches are often ripe in the end of August, and early in Sep- 
tember ; and when the season is favourable, they are greatly su- 
perior in flavour to those raised in hot-houses. Grapes also of 
various kinds ripen in the open air, in more places than one in 
the parish. A purple grape in good seasons ripens well at Sea 
Bank ; and in the Manse garden there is what may be called an 
Ayrshire vine, as it was raised from the seed of the royal Mus- 
cadine, ripened in the open air on the common stone wall of the 
garden. It is now, of sufficient age to bear fruit ; and we hope 

 In the former Statistical Report, while the climate is spoken of in general as 
salubrious, it is said that epidemic fevers are perhaps more frequent here than in the 
inland parishes. We are glad to say, that now fevers are considerably less frequent 
here, and in Saltcoals and Ardrossan, than in some of the neighbouring parishes.

that it will soon do credit to its Scottish origin. We have long 
had a yearly vintage of some dozens of good wine fronn our vine- 
yard ; but we must own that we are much more indebted to the 
prunings than to the grapes. The leaves and young wood con- 
tain much vinous juice, and when infused in boiling water, and 
some sugar added, yield a light sparkling wine called vinello, supe- 
rior, we doubt not, to the Vicar of Wakefield's celebrated home- 
made wine. 

From the vegetable world also, we have the surest proofs ot 
the mildness of our winters. Myrtles stand the winter without 
any cover, but flower only sparingly unless they have had some 
slight protection from the frost. Verbena triphylla, and Passi- 
flora ccBvulea, and Fuschia coccinea. F. gracilis, and F. conka, 
stand the winter, and flower profusely in summer. Erica arborea 
flowers in the open border, and even Erica Caffra stood several 
winters, and flowered in the open air. The lovely Crjclamen Comn, 
which will not stand the winter in the inland parts of the country, 
seems as hardy here as its compeer the snowdrop. Agapanthus 
umbellatus, or great African blue lily, and also Calla Ethiopica, 
brave our winters. Gladiolus grandiflorus, and Iris tuberosa 
flower without winter protection. The cape plant, Tritoma media, 
flowers from November till June ; and at Christmas, unless it be 
hard frost, we can form a nosegay from the open border, of from 
twenty-five to fifty diff"erent kinds of flowers. 

The comparative mildness of our climate may be more evident 
from the subjoined record of the days when several plants begin 
to flower, marking the earliest and the latest times of commence- 
ment ; and also the average time, taken from observations made 
during a considerable number of years. These observations were 
chiefly made at the Manse, which stands on elevated ground sixty- 
three feet above the level of the sea. Had they been made at Sea 
Bank, which is considerably better sheltered, and fully forty feet 
lower, the period of flowering would have been earlier by some days.

Hydrography. — The parish is watered by no stream of note, 
except on the eastern boundary, for some miles by the Garnock ; 
and on the south-east, for a short space, by the mingled waves of 
the Garnock and Irvine, before they fall into the sea. The wind- 
ings of the Garnock, from Kilwinning to its junction with the 
Irvine, bear some resemblance to the celebrated windings of the 
Forth at Stirling. The banks of the rivulet, which flows through 
Stevenston, are of considerable beauty at Grange, and as far up 
as the Glen, where there is a picturesque little cascade. It is at 
present SMijWzce, whether Ashgrove Loch be in whole, or only in 
part, within this parish. It covers thirty or forty acres.

Geology and Mineralogy.— The rocks in this parish are chiefly 
greenstone, Hmestone, and sandstone. Several of the little hills 
are deep mounds of water-worn stones and sandy gravel. In 
dioging for water at the Manse twelve years ago, the workmen, 
till they went down twenty feet, found nothing but a dry bed of 
this description ; and then, when they were beginning to lose hopes, 
excellent water sprung up, in sufficient abundance to supply the 
whole parish. On digging two feet deeper, they came to a stra- 
tum of clay. Before reaching the clay, they found mingled with 
the stones and gravel plenty of yellow ochre. 

In sinking for coal in the Turf-Dike pit, a seam of beautiful 
marhle was found a foot thick, and probably extensive as the coal - 
field. It was not known at the time to be marble, so that only a 
few specimens were kept as curiosities, on account of the fossil 
shells closely imbedded in it. One of these specimens was poUshed 
in proof of its excellence, on our hearing that a splendid marble 
fire-place had been formed at Chatelherault of precisely the same 
layer or deposit, found on the Duke of Hamilton's property in that 
neighbourhood. The shells of which it is chiefly composed, Unio 
pictorum of Lamarck, or probably rather Unio Urii of Fleming, show 
that this stratum is probably of lacustrine origin, these fossils being 
fresh water shells. 

Quarries.— The Capon Craig Gaw, near Sea Bank, furnishes 
an inexhaustible mass of remarkably firm greenstone ; but it is 
but little wrought, except to be broken down for repairing the 
highways. 

Ardeer or Stevenston Quarry.— Th\s is the most valuable quarry 
of white freestone or sandstone in the west of Scotland. The pro- 
duce of it has long been well known to the public under the name 
of Stevenston Stone, It is of very excellent quality. The colour 
is good ; and being firm and fine in the grain, and easily wrought, 
it takes a fine polish, and stands well. It is much used at home ; 
and it is still more in request in Dublin and Belfast, and other 
places in Ireland ; for it can be sawn like marble, with which it 
vies in beauty, and it can be formed into slabs of any size required. 
At home, and also in Ireland, it is used in the interior of houses, 
for stairs, the pavement of lobbies and halls, and for chimney-pieces, 
&amp;c. ; and externally, it is employed in public and private buildings 
for fronts, and chimneys, and columns, &amp;c. Columns can be furnish- 
ed of any dimensions, from 10 to 20 feet and upwards in altitude. 
It is used also for tomb-stones, and gate-posts, &amp;c. The ][uarry

lies from south-west to north-east, and the dip is to the south-west, 
the same as the coal strata, betwixt the first and the second of 
which it is found. It is in irregular layers or posts, varying from 
6 inches to 6 feet in thickness. It requires to be bared, where it 
is at present wrought, of about 25 feet of different kinds of soil, 
viz. of about 4 feet of sand, 3 feet of loam, -and the rest, down to 
the rock, till, or clate-clay. The stone passes from the quarry to 
Ardrossan by the railway, and is shipped at 10s. per ton of 16 cu- 
bical feet. The average number of men employed in the quarry 
is 35, and their average pay is 13s. per week. 

Parkend Quarry. — This quarry is of very superior Osmond stone, 
which is in much request for ovens, furnaces, &amp;c. There is also 
a bed of schist on the shore at Saltcoats, which stands the fire, and 
is used for furnaces. It is full of organic remains. 

Hallerliirst Limestone quarry. — This is a quarry which has not 
only been profitable to the public-spirited proprietor, but has 
tended much to the improvement of the parish. As the lease of 
it has expired, operations have been at a stand for some months, 
but will recommence, T doubt not, ere long with fresh spirit. The 
number of men employed in the quarry varies, but may average 
throughout the year, 8 or upwards, at 12s. per week. The lime- 
stone, when burned, is sold at the kiln at Is. 4d. per boll. 

There is abundance of limestone on the fine estate of Grange ; 
but at present, no more of it is quarried than is required for that 
portion of the estate which is farmed by the proprietor. 

The limestone and the sandstone quarries, and the whole of 
the coal-fields in the parish, are interesting in a scientific 
point of view, from the numerous organic remains which they 
contain. What changes must have taken place within the boun- 
daries of this little parish  In the lower grounds we have a stra- 
tum of firm rock, indicating, as we observed by the shells it con- 
tains, that it was once the silt at the bottom of a fresh-water basin. 
The sea shells, the remains of star-fish, &amp;c. imbedded in the lime- 
stone and schist, teach us, with equal certainty, that these rocks, 
which now hold an elevated situation, were originally formed at the 
bottom of the mighty deep. In the sandstone quarry again, and 
in the schist connected with the coal, we have beautiful impres- 
sions of ferns, reeds, Stigmaria, Sigillaria, Lepidodendra, and other 

• The sliclls, &amp;c. in the limestone and iill connected witli it are nunieroiis and va- 
rious. The shells in the shale connected with the coal are chiefly of the genera, Uiiio, 
Nncula, and Eiiompltalus.

plants unknown in the present day, many of them 420 feet beneath 
the surface of the earth, but which must once have flourished un- 
der tlie smihng sun in luxuriant vegetation. .We are lost in won- 
der when we think of these things ; and one end which the con- 
templation of them serves, is to convince us that we are supreme - 
ly ignorant. 

Coal Mi7ies.— As the coal mines furnish a rich source of emolu- 
ment and employment to so many in the parish, it is necessary to give 
some account of them in former times, and also in the present day. 
The working of coal as an article of commerce appears to have com- 
menced in Britain about the end of the twelfth century. The first 
charter giving liberty to the inhabitants of Newcastle to dig for 
coal was in 1239 ; and in 1291, a charter was given for the same 
purpose to the Abbey and Convent of Dunfermline. Even in 
1579, however, coal seems to have been so little known on the 
continent, that we find Abraham Ortel, in his " Theatrum orbis 
terrarum," saying, " En la region de Fife, se tire grand nombre de 
pierres noires hors de terre, fort propre d fairefeiir When they 
beo-an in this parish to dig up those " black stones" for fuel, we 
do not know. Though we have no written record, there is a tra- 
dition, supported by the remains of considerable heaps of ashes in 
the neighbourhood of the present town of Saltcoats, that salt was 
manufactured there at a very early period. It was then made, it 
is said, in their little pans or kettles, by poor people who lived in 
cots on the shore, and who at very small expense digged up the 
coal near the surface of the ground, to carry on their manufacture. 

In 1656, the whole parish was purchased by Sir Robert Cuning- 
hame ; and after his death in 1678, his estate came into the pos- 
session of his nephew of the same name, who soon began to carry 
on the public works with a degree of spirit till that time unknown 
in the parish. He began his operations at what is called the 
deep shank, in the little holm to the east of Stevenston kirk and 
Burn ; and erected a water-wheel to draw the water out of that 
pit. He also, with great spirit and judgment and perseverance, 
put down several shafts or pits in the coal-field, at considerable 
distances from each other, to ascertain the thickness, quality, and 
declivity of the various strata, as well as the position of the chief 
troubles ; and the papers which he left to his successors shewed 
the surprising exactness of the knowledge he had thus obtained, 
and proved of great service to them in their operations. On the 
west side, too, of the parish, he drove a level mine, for a mile and

a-half, through his own coal-field and part of Lord Eglinton's, which 
laid the upper part of several of the seams dry ; and the coal 
which was wrought at the townhead of Saltcoats and some other 
places, was carried up, by stairs, on the backs of the wives and 
daughters of the colliers. 

It was in vain, however, to turn out coal, unless it could be 
taken to market ; and as Dublin afforded by far the best mar- 
ket, he saw the necessity of having a harbour at Saltcoats, 
and accordingly he began his operations for this purpose about 
1 684, at what had till this time been called the Creek of Saltcoats. 
The building of the harbour was a work of time, and difficulty, and 
expense, as the winter storms often demolished much of what had 
been reared in summer. But it was completed about the year 
1700 ; and it remains till this day, as a monument of this talented, 
enterprising, and public-spirited gentleman. The only aid he ob- 
tained, was the excise, for nineteen years, of the ale used in the 
parish of Stevenston, granted by an act of the Scottish Parlia- 
ment ; but as the excise duty was very low, and as there were few 
to drink the ale in these days, he was not greatly benefited by 
this. He constructed salt-pans also at considerable expense. And 
as there were no steam-engines in these days, the water-wheel 
which he formed, and the two gins which he employed, drawn by 
sixteen horses, for freeing the pits of water, along with the ex- 
pense resulting from his skilful survey of the coal-field, and the 
building of the harbour, more than swallowed up his profits. From 
this and other circumstances, he found it necessary to dispose of 
much of his fine property. Kerila, with its rich adjoining grounds, 
he sold to John Hamilton, Esq. of Grange, in 1685. Ducathall 
and Ardeer, and that large tract extending as far as the Misk, he 
sold to the Rev. Patrick Warner, of Irvine, in 1707. On that 
part of the estate near Saltcoats which he retained, he built in 
1708 the house of Sea Bank for his own residence. He died ni 
1715. 

At the time of his death, the public works were in a low state, 
and a manager was appointed, who carried them on for two years. 
Afterwards, the coal and salt-works were let to the shipmasters of 
Saltcoats, for the yearly rent of L. 250. Having heard that steam- 
engines had begun to be employed for pumping water, these 
spirited shipmasters employed Provost M'Taggart of Irvine, who 
had joined them in the lease, to go to Lotidon to purchase a steam- 
engine, and to engage an experienced person to set up the engnie,

and to superintend its operation. This was in 1719, only five 
years after the steam-engine had begun to be employed at New- 
castle; and this was the second that had been setup in Scotland. 
The cylinder, however, of Newcomen's engine, Vhich was purchas- 
ed, was only 18 inches in diameter, and the engineer, after carry- 
inff on for some time an unsuccessful contest, decamped in the 
night. Another engineer from Newcastle was engaged, but stiil 
the water could not be kept under. Seeing,|however, a good 
field of coal, he took, as one of the partners of an English com- 
pany, the lease, which the shipmasters willingly gave up, agree- 
ing to pay, as they had done, L. 250 a-year, for thirty-one years. 
This new Company carried on the works till 1728, when they 
failed. The coal and salt-works came then into the hands of a 
company in Falmouth, who carried them on till 1731, when 
they also failed. A law-suit having taken place, the Lords of 
Session, in 1732, appointed Mr John Cuninghame of Windyhall, 
as factor and manager, to carry on thejworks. About this time, 
James Cuninghame of Auchenharvie died, and was succeeded bv 
his son, Robert, a minor. Mr Cuninghame of Windyhall seems 
to have proceeded with great spirit, and set up an engine of 38 
inches cylinder at the deep shank at Stevenston. In 1733, Ro- 
bert Cuninghame of Auchenharvie died, and his sisters succeeded 
as heirs-portioners. In 1737, the eldest of them was married to 
Mr John Reid, second son of the Rev. Mr Reid, minister of Ste- 
venston ; and soon after this Mr Cuninghame of Windyhall ceased 
to be manager of the public works, — Mr John Reid of Sea 
Bank, we believe, taking the charge of them. 

From this time, for more than a quarter of a century, they were 
carried on under the direction of the heirs-portioners, but with lit- 
tle success, it would appear, as in 1763 they were let for nineteen 
years to Mr A. Crawford, with two breaks in the lease. He died 
in 1765, and his friends availed themselves of the first of these 
breaks, and gave up the lease about 1767. 

Brighter days, however, were now about to arise. In 1770, 
Robert, the eldest son of John Reid of Sea Bank, succeeded his 
father, and, in consequence of a special agreement with the heirs- 
portioners, became possessed of the estate of Auchenharvie, and 
added the name of Cuninghame to his own. The right for fifty- 
seven years, which had been retained when Ardeer was sold, of 
working the coal on that property, having now expired, he enter- 
ed into a copartnery with Mr Warner, of Ardeer, to work the coal

on their respective properties, Mr Reid Cuniiigliame, of Auclien- 
harvie, being tbe"sole manager. One of the first operations of this 
enterprizing and succcessful manager, was to improve the har- 
bour of Saltcoats, and to form a canal from the coal-field to the 
harbour, a distance of more than two miles. In those days this 
was no small undertaking, but it was accomplished, and the 
canal navigated in 1772, being the first on which business was 
done in Scotland. It would lead us greatly to. overpass our limits 
to trace his proceedings ; but the best proof of the judgment and 
spirit with which he acted is, that, for some years previous to his 
death in 1814, the profits shared by the partners were from 
L. 2000 to L. 6000 a-year. 

Subsequent to the death of Mr Reid Cuninghame of Auchen- 
harvie, Mr Beaumont acted as manager for the Company, for ten 
years. For the last ten years, it has been under the management 
of Mr Croker, who has carried on the extensive operations that 
were necessary, with great skill, steadiness, and success. The 
quantity of coal raised from Stevenston colliery during the year, 
endinsf 29th October 1836, was as follows: —

The coal is generally shipped at from 8s. 6d. to 10s., and at pre- 
sent 12s. 6d. per ton of 28 cwts., and sold in Dublin, Belfast, &amp;c. 
from 12s. 6d. to 16s., and at present, 20s. per ton of -20 cwt. The 
small coal or culm, at from 4s. to 5s. 4d. per ton, is sold for the 
salt-works or lime-burning. 

The coal strata in this parish extend from Irvine harbour, and 
the river Garnock on the east, to Saltcoats harbour on the west- 
ern boundary of the parish ; and, no doubt, extend a great way 
under the sea. They are intersected by several dislocations, the 
direction of which has been fully ascertained. The chief of these 
dislocations is a true mineral vein or dike, composed of green- 
stone of a very close texture, intermingled with numerous spots 
of a light green-coloured spar. It is known by the name of the 
Caponcraiff-ffara, and is distinctly seen rising above all the other 
strata, on the north side of the town of Stevenston. Its general 
line of bearing is 11° west of north. This dike is about 16 yards 

• About 28 cwt. to the ton.

in thickness. It intersects the coal strata in a perpendicular direc- 
tion, and in all likelihood to an impenetrable depth. It disjoins 
the coal strata from 16 to 20 yards, and injures the seams of coal 
for a few yards on each side, giving them a charred appearance, 
but has no effect in elevating or depressing the strata on either side. 

The other dislocations of the strata in this coal-field, are known 
by the name of steps or slips, and are of much more common oc- 
currence than the dislocation or dike before-mentioned. These 
slips not only disjoin the coal strata, but throw them up or down, 
from the extent of a foot to many fathoms. 

The first of these slips, east of Capon-craig-gaw, is known by 
the name of the Turf-dike. Its direction is 25° west of north. 
This slip begins to be perceptible in a pit 40 fathoms deep, and 
increases so to the dip, that at the depth of 50 fathoms, it is found 
to be a slip of 7 fathoms up to the east. This being the lowest 
point where this dislocation has been touched, we may conclude 
that it continues to increase towards the dip. The 2d slip east 
from the Turf-dike is known by the name of the Piper-haugh' slip. 
Its direction is 35° west of north, and it throws the coal strata 
20 fathoms up to the north-east. The 3d slip east from the Piper- 
haugh is known by the name of the No. 5. slip. Its direction 
is west of north 30°, and it throws the coal strata 7 fathoms down 
to the north-east. The 4th slip east from No. 5 is known by the 
name of the Boghead slip. Its direction is 22° west of north, and 
it throws the coal strata 5 fathoms up to the north-east. The 5th 
slip east from the Boghead slip is known by the name of the Mill- 
dam slip. Its direction is 19" west of north, and it throws the 
strata 15 fathoms up to the eastward. The 6th slip east from the 
Mill-dam slip is known by the name of the Tod-holes slip, being 
found in the Tod-holes workings in the parish of Kilwinning. It 
passes through the eastern extremity of this parish in the same di- 
rection as the former, throwing the strata 4 fathoms up to the east- 
ward. The 7th slip is in the east part of the Misk working. The 
extent of this slip has not been ascertained, but it is one of a few 
fathoms only. 

The only dislocation of the strata of any consequence, to the 
west of the Capon-craig gaw, is known by the name of the Cu- 
ninghame-head slip, which runs nearly in the same direction as the 
slips previously mentioned. It is situated a little to the west of the 
tower at Sea Bank, and is said to be a slip only of a few fathoms. 

•" Sty is the term used here, but slij} is in more general use elsewhere.

Besides the above-mentioned slip, there are several of less con- 
sequence, adjoining to Saltcoats harbour, which, being at the 
western extremity of the parish, can have little influence on any 
operations carried on within the bounds. 

The line of bearing of this coal-field is in an eastern and a 
western direction. , The dip of the strata is southward, and the 
rise consequently is to the north, which dip and rise decline on 
an average from the horizon, about I in 7. 

The operations of the late Robert R. Cuninghame, Esq. were 
at first chiefly at the Misk, next, from the Piper-haugh westward. 
But from 1784, till lately, the mining operations in this parish were 
chiefly confined to a winning made by steam machinery, which gain- 
ed the five-quarter, parrot, turf, and little coal, at the depth of 
54 fathoms. The chief engine employed here is on the Watt and 
Bolton construction. It was made by Mr John Nelson, Glasgow, 
and is thought of first rate excellence. The cylinder is 5 feet in 
diameter, with 8 feet stroke ; and pumps 15 inches bore, dis- 
charging 4 tons of water per minute. 

Of late, a mine has been run to the dip across the strata, and a 
pit sunk at the extremity, which gives the Bow-bridge, five-quar- 
ter, parrot, turf, and little coal, at the depth of 70 fathoms. 
About two years ago a pit was sunk near Bog, called No. 6, which 
gives the main coal, at the depth of 44 fathoms ; and they are at 
present engaged in sinking a pit, No. 7, which will give the same 
coal, close on the Garnock.

The manner in which this coal-field is wrought is by running 
dip-head levels from the shaft, exactly in the line of bearing of 
the coal-field, from which, at ciertain equal distances, rooms are 
set off a-cropping, which, when driven up, are thirled occasionally, 
leaving pillars sufficient to support the roof. 

There are at present four pits going, in which are employed,

under ground j 140 men, and 50 boys. Above ground, there is a 
manager, clerk, overseer, pit-head-men, machine-men, engine- 
men, and labourers, amounting to 30 more, besides 5 smiths, 3 
Wrights, and 1 mason. There are also 20 men with horses em- 
ployed on the rail-road. How many find employment in the land 
and sea carriage of the 40,000 tons sold in the year, we cannot 
tell. The colliers receive at present 5s. a-day. Their employ- 
ment is laborious and dangerous. The loss of life, by stones from 
the roof, or similar calamities, has, during the last twenty-five 
years, been at the rate of one every year. And much injury is often 
sustained where life is not lost. The works are at present well 
ventilated ; but when this is not the case, the fool-hardy and the 
thoughtless are scorched by the inflammable air. Even when the 
safety-lamp has shewn that there is danger, there are some who 
rashly engage in work, forgetful that though the safety-lamp caus- 
ed no explosion, their own lamps may soon work destruction.

crab's leavings. It makes requital, however, by enlargmg with its 
body and a horny substance which it secretes, the hermit's cell, 
aid forms a better nest for the eggs than the simple shell would 
do. The colouring of the Actinia is very brilliant. We are not 
aware that it has heen observed by British naturalists. We found 
lately a magnificent Medusa on the shore, which seemed to corre- 
spond to the description given of Rliizostoma undulata, found on 
the shores of Cornwall. It was more than a yard in diameter. 

Zoophyta.— The following corallines and other zoophytes have 
been picked up on the shore ; and we doubt not that m this, as in 
the other departments, by more careful inspection, the list might 
be greatly enlarged: Corallina officinalis; Alcyonium eclnnatum ;

often give such brilliancy by night to the agitated waves of our west- 

Concholoyy.-There is seldom shell-fish of any kind m such 
abundance on our shore, as to be worth collecting for the market 
But if we cannot boast of dehcious oysters, and mussels, and cockles 
to gratify the gourmand, we can hold out to our scientific friends 
a "feast of shells," which many of them wil be disposed o 
think still more delectable. As that distinguished naturalist, Fio- 
e sor Flemmg of Aberdeen, to whose kindness we have been 
indebted for much of our mollnscal lore, says that our concholo. 
gical stores make some approach to those of the coast of Den 
fhire, we shall, along with some of our land and f-sh w ter Mo/ 
J, insert a list of the rarer shells picked up by us on he shore 
oTthis parish, chiefly betwixt Saltcoats harbour and Stevenston 
burn-foot; employing the nomenclature of Dr Flemmg m his va- 
Suable and wellknown work, " The British Animals." Several of 
themwe suspect,are newto Scotland; and two of them, we believe, 
are non-descripts, and have not before been found.

tossed  We were not a little pleased, however, lately to find, that our pity with re- 
spect to sonie of them at least, is very much misplaced. We observed on a sunny 
September day, in a pool of sea water left on Stevenston strand by the ebbing tide, 
what we at first thought some of the scaly brood at play. On closer investigation, 
however, we found that it was the fry of Pecten opercular is skipping quite nimbly 
through the pool. Their motion was rapid and zig-zag, very like that of ducks in a 
sunny blink, rejoicing in the prospect of rain. They seemed, by the sudden opening 
and closing of their valves, to have the power of darting like an arrow through the 
water. One jerk carried them some yards, and then by another sudden jerk they 
were off in a moment in a different tack. We doubt not that their full-grown youths 
engage in similar amusements, though as pectens of greater gravity they choose to 
romp unseen, and play their gambols in the deep. 

This pecten is the cLam or as it is called in the west the champ, which children ga- 
ther with delight on tile shore, and at the age we saw it perform, it was only about 
the size of a silver groat. The Pecten Jacobeus, a rarer species of the clam or scallop, 
was worn by pilgrims of old as a token that they had crossed the sea on a visit to some 
shrine, and were consequently entitled to 

" Fix the Scallop on their hat before." 

J This non-descript pecten is very beautiful, but we have never yet got a perfect 
specimen. We found two valves at different times, but they were not matches, and 
both of them seemed young. It resembled the fry of Pecten opercularis, but it had double 
the number of ribs, and the ears were dififerent in shape from those of P. opercularis.

Botany. — When we consider that about 1200 acres are nearly 
covered with drifting sand, and that the rest of this little parish is so 
rich and valuable, that as much as possible of it is in a state of 
cultivation, one would not expect that it would afford much scope 
for the botanist. He might make out a list, however, that might 
stand comparison with the Flora of parishes of far greater pro- 
mise. But we regret, that from the nature of this publication, and 
the space already occupied, only a very few out of the long list of

There is a good deal of wood round the mansions of the re- 
sident heritors. The finest trees in the parish are those that form 
the old avenue leading to Grange, and originally to the ancient 
Castle of Kerilaw. But though the trees in general are not of 
great antiquity, the plantations are pretty extensive around Ardeer 
and Sea Bank, and still more around Grange ; so that the parish 
when viewed from the shore or from the sea, has a remarkably rich, 
clothed, comfortable appearance. 

The aspect of the parish, indeed, from several points of view, is 
remarkably pleasing. One of the best views of it is, as you ap-

ppoach Stevenston from Kilwinning. In the foreground you have 
the church and part of the village. The noble back-ground is 
formed by the wooded heights above Sea Bank, surmounted by the 
magnificent peaks of Arran in the distance. The view from the 
south, though of quite a different character, is scarcely inferior to 
this. From the shore, all the principal residences in the parish are 
seen on the gentle acclivity before you. Ardeer, with its green 
wood and terraced gardens, is conspicuous on the right. More u 
land, you have Hullerhirst on a very commanding site, and Hay- 
ocks still prominent over a thriving young plantation. Worthy of 
the centre of the scene, you behold the mansion house of Grange, 
and the ivy-mantled turrets of ancient Kerilaw, embowered m 
woods, stretching onward to the distant glen. In the fore-ground, 
you have the stately church and modest manse above the subjacent 
village, on a situation not surpassed by any on the coast. Lovely 
Mayville salutes you on the left, breathing odours from a thousand 
shrubs and flowers. Sheltered, and sweet, and cheerful, Sea Bank 
presents itself on the west, with its green fields, and woody braes, 
and Martello tower, and mounted battery. And the tower and spire 
of Saltcoats form a good termination on the left ; for though it has 
few surrounding trees to give softness to chimney tops and archi- 
tectural angles, it compensates at times by its forest of masts, a 
most interesting feature in sea-coast scenery. 

And still more delightful are the views from the parish. Arran, 
to the south-west, beyond all doubt, forms the most striking feature 
in the landscape. Westward, the view embraces Ardrossan Castle 
and harbour and town, as well as the Isles of Bute and Cumbraes, 
and is terminated by part of Cantyre, and by the two pinnacles of 
Jura, and a hill in the north of Islay. To the south and south- 
west, you have the Craig of Ailsa, as it were, floating on the wave, 
and in favourable states of the atmosphere you have at times a dis- 
tant view of Ireland. More to the left, you see Irvine and Troon, 
and Ayr, and the coast of Carrick, till it meets with Wigtonshire, 
near Lochryan. More to the east y ou have the tower of Kilwin- 
ning, the castle and extensive woods of Eglinton, the distant Gal- 
loway hills near Carsphairn, and the Carrick hills above Straiten. 
And towards the north-east you see a rich tract of Cuninghame 
about Kilmaurs and Kilmarnock ; .while more remote you see Lou- 
don Hill rising from the plain, as if to vie with Ailsa Craig on the 
other side, emerging from the deep.

II. — Civil. History. 
We have already mentioned that, in the twelfth century. More- 
ville, Lord of Cuninghame, and High Constable of Scotland, gave 
to a family of the name of Loccard the barony of Stevenston, com- 
prehending the present parish, and the lands of Corsbie in west 
Kilbride ; and the lands of Gill and Munich' in Dairy ; and the 
parish, according to Chalmers in his " Caledonia," look its name 
from Stephen, one of Loccard or Lockhart's sons. From the 
Lockharts it seems soon to have come into the possession of the 
Loudon family, from whom the name of Saltcoats- Campbell is still 
given to that part of the town which is in this parish. We do not 
know with certainty how long it belonged to the Loudon family. 
There is a tradition that Kerila Castle was for some time the resi- 
dence of the Abbot of Kilwinning, but we have not been able to 
ascertain the truth of this. 

It is certain, however, that before and after the Reformation 
the parish belonged to the Earl of Glencairn. We have lately 
seen a lease for 999 years, granted by Glencairn, signed and seal- 
ed by him in 1545, at Kerila. f It is one of nine given about 
that period to nine fishermen in Saltcoats, by which each of them 
was to have some falls of ground, still called the Nine Yards, 
in that town, and also pasture for a cow and a follower, on the 
moor betwixt Rough Castle and the Sea-loch, on condition 
that they every spring, in their two boats, carried the Earl's fur- 
niture from the Creek of Saltcoats to Finlayston, and brought it 
back again in the/oZ/, when the family returned to their residence 
at Kerila ; and, moreover, that each of them gave him yearly half 
a barrel of herrings. The ancient hall of Kerila Castle was or- 
namented with the coats of arms of the Scottish nobility, taken, 
according to tradition, from the Abbey of Kilwinning, when it was 
partly destroyed at the Reformation. 

But this parish soon passed from the Glencairn ftmiily. By 
a charter kindly put into our hands by R. Cuninghame, Esq. 
of Auchenharvie, -we find that the barony of Stevenston be- 
came the property of Sir Thomas Boyd of Bonshall, in the year 
1609. Nor did Sir Thomas long enjoy it ; for by title-deeds in 
the charter-chest at Grange, which we have been allowed to 
inspect, we find that in 1627, Sir Thomas Boyd of Bonshall, 
with the consent of Dame Grizzel Cuninghame, his spouse, con- 

• Some of the best lands in the parish still hold of the l.oudon nimily.

veys the lands and barony of Stevenston in favour of Sir William 
Cuninghame of Cuninghame-Head. 

In less than thirty years, we find another change, for in 1656 
the parish and barony of Stevenston were purchased by Sir Ro- 
bert Cuninghame, Physician for Scotland to Charles II. We 
have already mentioned that his nephew found it necessary to dis- 
pose of much of his estate towards the end of that century, and 
the beginning of the next. In 1685, Kerila, the mansion-house, 
and the adjoining lands, were sold to John Hamilton, whose family 
had been the Hamiltons of Carabskeith, and afterwards of Cambs- 
keith and Grange, so early as 1423. Kerila Castle continued to 
be the mansion-house of this family till about fifty years ago, when 
the present House of Grange was built on a fine situation, at a 
little distance from the old castle of Kerila. 

About 1707, other portions of the parish were sold, viz. Ardeer 
to Rev. Patrick Warner; and Town-Head of Saltcoats to the Earl 
of Eglinton ; and HuUerhirst to a family of the name of Kelso ; 
and all the parish, with the exception of Hayocks and Mayville, 
still continues to belong to the families of Hamilton of Grange, 
Cuninghame of Auchenharvie, Kelso, now Hamilton of HuUer- 
hirst and the Retreat, and to the Earl of Eglinton. 

Stevenston. — The town of Stevenston is of considerable anti- 
quity, being mentioned in a charter of the Loudon family, as far 
back as the year 1240. There was a small village of some anti- 
quity, called Piper Heugh, of which there are still some remains 
in the wood at Ardeer. The inhabitants of it were chiefly trump- 
makers ; and there were some, it would appear, in Stevenston of 
the same profession, for in the Commissariat of Glasgow, we find 
the record of the death, " in 1627, of Agnes Glasgow, spous of 
John Logane, trump-maker in Stevenstone."" The trump which 
they manufactured at Piper-Heugh was the Jews' HarjD; and from 
the name of their residence, it would appear that this little colony 
possessed the united accomplishments of Jubal and Tubal, being 
not only " artificers in brass and iron," but " handlers of the 
harp," and it is probable of the pipe. The voice of these ancient 
minstrels is silent, — the pipers and harpers, like their woodland 
village, have passed away ; but they seem to have bequeathed the 
mantle of song to their posterity, for the inhabitants of Stevenston 
are still distinguished for their musical propensities, as an instru- 
mental band, and glee club, and, what is better, the excellent sing- 
ing of the congregation in church, amply testify.

Saltcoats. The town of Saltcoats, more than a third of which, 

comprehending the harbour, is in this parish, is also a place of 
considerable antiquity. It must have been a place of some note 
between three and four hundred years ago, as in 1528 it was 
erected into a burgh of barony, by James V. of Scotland, though 
we do not find that it ever availed itself of the privileges then 
granted. Some great blight, however, seems to have come upon 
it, for, says Dr Wodrow, in the former Statistical Account, " It 
is certain, from unquestionable traditionary testimony, that of 
parents to their children now living, that a century after that time, 
or about 130 years ago 1661, there were ou\y fou7' houses in 
Saltcoats." We may add, that, from traditionary testimony on 
which we can rely, we know that the first slated house in Saltcoats 
was built in 1703 by William Miller, who obtained a feu of the 
ground from Adam Campbell of Gargunnock, then a person of 
great influence in this parish, though his name has almost past 
into oblivion. It is that house in Quay Street, which is occupied 
by Hugh Robertson, and it was the first house in the street. A 
descendant of William Miller's, still living in an adjoining house, 
gave us this information :— The few houses that were then in Salt- 
coats were low thatched cots. Saltcots the true spelling as found 
in old records is now a town of some magnitude, covering, with 
its numerous gardens, a considerable extent of ground, with a po- 
pulation of nearly 4000, of whom 1466 are in the parish of Ste- 
venston. 

Antiquities. — In the second volume of Analecta Scotica, just pub- 
lished, there is some correspondence betwixt the Rev. Robert Wod- 
row of Eastwood, the church historian, and Sir Robert Sibbald. On 
- 23d November 1710, Mr Wodrow writes to Sir Robert Sibbald as 
follows : " What comes now is a speare of a mixed metall, which 
was found with the Roman coin of Faustina which I let you see in 
Cuninghame, in the parish of Stevenston, a little from the shore, 
about a mile from Saltcoats to the south south-east. There are 
little blowing hills of sand there, and, by the blowing of the sand, 
there began to appear somewhat like the ruins of a buildmg, and 
it's here wher this speare was gote some years since." 

In 1832, when some labourers were levelling a sandy field at 
Dubbs, they came to a causeway five feet under the surface. This 
pavement was six yards long and two feet broad. There was laid 
across one end of it, a stone of about a ton weight. At the ottier 
end of it, there was a stone coffin three feet in length and two in 



STEVENSTON. 



4t5 



breadth, containing two urns, the one of gray and the other of 
black pottery. There was nothing in the urns but earth. Within 
the stone coffin, they found five buttons formed of jet, and as fine- 
ly polished as if they had been newly deposited. The buttons 
were of different sizes; the largest more than an inch in diameter. 
They were concave on one side, and convex on the other, with 
knobs for attaching them. The urns were broken. The buttons 
are in the possession of Colonel Hamilton. 

Old Buildiriffs.— There are few remains of ancient buildings in 
the parish. We have already mentioned the fine old ruin of Ke- 
■ rila. Robertson mentions, on the authority of Wood's Peerage, 
that some time previous to 1488, when inhabited by the Cuning-- 
hames, it was,, in consequence of a feud, sacked by their hostile 
neighbours, the Montgomeries of Eglinton; and part of it was de- 
stroyed. The Cuninghames did not forget this neighbourly visit ; 
and forty years afterwards returned it in kind, by burning Eglinton 
Castle to the ground. 

Castle Hill, on the estate of Grange, indicates by its name what 
it has once been ; and though every vestige of a castle at that 
place is now gone, we learn from Pont, in his Account of Cun- 
inghame, that the castle was spoken of in his day. And Hawk- 
Hill, in the neighbourhood, we doubt not, was the place at which 
many a gay galliard met, with falcon on thumb, when about to en- 
gage in one of the favourite recreations of these early times. 

Strangers, in proceeding from Stevenston to Saltcoats, observe 
an old castle near the shore. We blush not to tell, that it is the 
remains of the engine-house, in which was erected, in 1719, the 
second steam-engine that had ever been employed in Scotland, and 
close on the line of the first navigated canal in Scotland  These 
mark the beginnings of that career of enterprise which has so 
greatly changed the face of our country, and the condition of its 
inhabitants ; and had progress in religion, in our beloved land, 
kept pace with our rapid progress in other respects, we would 
have continued to be for a name and a praise among all the nations 
of the earth. 

• Without going so far back as the beginning of the last century, it may be worth 
recording, by way of contrast to present times, and to show the homely state of Scot- 
tish society eighty or ninely years ago, that a very venerable and intelhgent old lady, 
who died in 124, in the ninety-third year of her age, and the sixty-seventh of her 
widowhood, told the writer of this report, that when she came to Stevenston Manse, 
as the minister's wife, in 1751, there was not a carpet in the whole parish, and that 
she was the first who had such a luxury,— having made it for herself, by sewing to- 
gether the lists or borders of cloth, which she got from cloth-merchants and tailors

Jlental. The rental of the whole parish when valued hi Crom- 
well's time, was L. 1206 Scots, equal to L. 100, 10s. Sterling; and 
Wodrow, the Church Historian, speaks of it as the same at the 
time he wrote, about 1722. So late as 1770, the best land in the 
parish was let on an average at 2s. 6d. per acre. About 1780, 
much of the best land in the parish was let on lease for nineteen 
years, at 1 Os. per acre ; and when the leases expired, what had 
been let at 10s. rose to L.2 per acre. For some years about 
1812, several parks about Stevenston, which in 1770 had brought 
only 2s. 6d. per acre, were let on lease for common agricultural 
purposes, at L. 10 and L. 11 per acre. Though not much more 
than the half of the parish has been improved, no parish in the 
whole district of Cuninghame has increased nearly so much in 
value as Stevenston, since the whole of them were valued by Go- 
vernment in 1652 and 1653. By a table in Robertson's " De- 
scription of Cuninghame," it appears from the returns in 1809, 
that on an average of all the parishes of the district, the rental 
was eighteen times more in 1809 than in 1653. The greatest 
rise, however, had taken place in Stevenston, where the rental was 
forty-five times larger, having risen from L. 100, 19s. to L. 4536, 
17s. 8d. How much more has the parish risen in value, if we 
take into account the great additional revenue arising from the 
coal mines, the stone and hme quarries, the railroad, the harbour, 
some of which were not in existence at that eariy period, and others 
yielded almost nothing. 

Eminent Mere.— Among the distinguished persons connected 
with this parish we may surely rank Robert Cuninghame, Esq. 
the nephew of Sir Robert Cuninghame, who, at a time when min- 
ing was httle understood in this country, showed such science and 
enterprise, and furnished, though at a high price, such a store of 
important information for his successors. 

The most remarkable person, however, connected with this pa- 
rish, was the late General Alexander Hamilton, of the family of 
Grange, though America was the field in which he distinguished 
himself. He was excelled by none as a general, orator, financier, 
statesman, and lawyer. In the words of one who knew him, he 

in Kilmarnock She also told us, that the stipend meal, to which, on the death of 
her husband, she was entitled, in 1768, sold at 6d. per peck ; that a leg of beef, at 
Martinmas might then be purchased for 5s. ; that salmon sold at Id. a pound, of 
K ; butter t4d. per pound, of 24 oz. ; and eggs at Id the dozen ; tha, a tadov 
received 4d. per day and his meals ; that a maid-servanfs halt-year fee was Us. 4d 
and a new apron ; Ld that coals were then shipped for Ireland at 4s. 7d. per ton of

was " the Mentor of Washington, the framer of the present con- 
stitution of America, and, moreover, a man of strict honour and 
integrity ; equally esteemed in public and in private life." 

There is a third distinguished person, however, connected with 
this parish, who, as a sufferer in the cause of religious liberty, in 
the persecuting days of Charles II., ranks higher in our eyes than 
either of the two we have mentioned, — and that is the Rev. Pa- 
trick Warner, minister of Irvine. After being hcensed to preach 
the Gospel, being recommended to the East India Company, he 
was sent out as an ordained minister of Fort St George on the 
coast of Coromandel. After remaining there for some time, he 
sighed to return to his native land, though to share in the suffer- 
ings of his persecuted countrymen ; and he returned accordingly 
in 1677. 

For two years after his return, he and the celebrated John 
Welsh of Ayr, son-in-law of John Knox, preached much in the 
fields in Carrick and in Galloway, where Mr Warner's brother 
was minister of Balmaclellan. After the battle of Bothwell-bridge, 
he was in such constant danger, that he found it necessary toflee 
to Holland for some time. On his return, though the danger was 
scarcely lessened, he continued to preach in private houses as often 
as he had an opportunity. In 1681 he married a daughter of the 
very pious and eminent divine, Mr Guthrie, minister of Fenwick. 
When living in his mother-in-law's house in Edinburgh, the house 
was violently bi'oken open at midnight by a party of soldiers, and he 
was taken from bed to prison. After lying in prison for a considerable 
time, and after several unsuccessful attempts had been made to con- 
vict him, he was, on his own petition, allowed to go into voluntary 
banishment. He first went to England, but, being there cast into pri- 
son in consequence of false accusations ; as soon as he was liberated, 
he embarked for Rotterdam, where, with his wife and family, he 
continued till 1687. Having then received a call to be minister of 
Irvine, he returned to Scotland, and was inducted as minister of 
Irvine in 1688. From the records of Presbytery he appears to 
have stood very high in the opinion of his brethren ; and we find 
that, in 1695, the Presbytery, being advised by the Commission of 
the Church to elect one of their number to attend Parliament, as 
some affairs of the church were -to come before it, the Presbytery 
elected Mr Warner to go to Edinburgh to join his orethren for 
the good of the church. After being minister of Irvine for twenty 
years, owing to the increasing infirmities of old age, he retired to

AYRSHIRE. 



Ardeer, in this parish, which had become his property, where he 
died in 172-2, being then the oldest minister of the church. He 
was alive when Wodrow, the celebrated church historian, who was 
married to his daughter, wrote ; and he therefore says in his work, 
" His own modesty, and my near relation to him, will not permit 
me to say what I could, as to his personal and ministerial charac- 
ter, piety, learning, and usefulness. His character, indeed, is so 
savoury, and well-known in this church that I need say nothing 
of it." 

Heritors. — The parish is divided among nine landowners, viz. 
Alexander Hamilton, Esq. of Grange ; Patrick Warner, Esq. of 
Ardeer ; Robert Cuninghame, Esq. of Auchenharvie ; the Right 
Honourable the Earl of Eglinton ; Alexander Hamilton Hamilton 
of Hullerhirst; Mrs Cuming of Logie; and John, Alexander, and 
William Muir, Esq. of Hayocks. The greater part of these 
have mansion-houses in the parish, and five of them are at present 
resident. 

Registers— owQ of our parish registers go further back than 
1700, and many portions of them have been lost. The register of 
marriages has been regularly kept from April 1701 till May 1717 ; 
and from May 1737 till January 1746, and from January 1747 till 
the present time, February 1837. The register of baptisms has been 
regularly kept from July 1700 till November 1718; irregularly kept 
from 1718 till 1737 ; and regularly from 1737 till near the end of the 
century ; but from that time to the present, it cannot be considered 
as regularly kept, as the Dissenters do not record the names of 
their children. A register of deaths has been kept from 1747 till 
the present time ; but for a considerable time, those only whose 
friends have paid for the mortcloth have been recorded. We have 
always for the fourth of a century, marked the number of deaths 
in the Year. The average for the last seven years is high, being 
77i in a population varying from 3540 to 3681. The cholera 
year is included ; and in several of the other years the mortality 
was greater than usual. The average of four previous years, when 
the population was very nearly the same as during the last seven 
vears was 56|. The great number of children in the parish, pro- 
bablY, raises the average of mortality above what might be expected 
in this healthy climate. lu visiting the parish in 1832, -'e marked

The number of resident families of independent fortune is only

Alexander Hamilton, Esq. of Grange, and Robert Cuning- 
hame, Esq. of Auchenharvie, are alternately patrons of the parish. 

It adds not a little to the general comfort, that there is in the 
parish such abundance of excellent coal ; for though coal is high- 
priced at present, it is still cheap to us, compared with what it is to 
those at a distance. The colliers have high wages, and might all be 
comfortable ; and many of them are so. The colliers are an interest- 
ing class, and would stand higher in public opinion were it not for 

 Almost all in this mournful list of ahsenters profess to belong to the Established 
Church ; yea, in their own way, to be staunch friends of the Church; and some of 
them say, when their minister expostulates with tliem, " I am sure if we do not come 
to yOH, we do not go to any body else ' It must be owned that they have not had 
fair play. It is little more than three years since they have had a church that could 
contain even the half of those who were of age to attend. Matters ate on a better 
footing now ; and we hope that, under their present advantages, many of them may be 
induced to give more pleasing proof of their regard for the church and their minister.

a portion who wander from work to work, having no character to 
lose, and bringing discredit on the steady and the stationary. There 
are also at times ringleaders who mislead them. The weavers were 
for some years, from scarcity of work, and lowness of wages, in very 
straitened circumstances ; and the long-continued depression this 
season has again been very hard on them. Almost all the females 
in the parish are dexterous muslin flowerers, but they were thrown 
idle also last summer. Many of them are quite distinguished in 
this Hne, and, as the finest and best paid articles are given to such, 
they add greatly to the emoluments of the family when trade is 
good. A good flowerer can earn from Is. to Is. 6d., and 2s. per 
day. 

That the people in general can obtain a competent portion of 
substantial food, appears by the quantity of meat sold by the flesh- 
ers in the town of Stevenston. By a return made to us, we find 
that about 2864 stones of flesh meat are sold by them in the course 
of the year, and this is not all that is used in Stevenston and the 
neighbourhood, for much meat in addition to this is brought from 
Saltcoats ; and of the 500 dozen rabbits killed in the parish an- 
nually, the people of Stevenston have their share. 

IV: — Industry. 
Much that belongs to this department has already come under 
our notice in treating of the colliery and the quarries. But there 
are other branches of industry which we shall as briefly as possible 
mention. 

The Salt and Magnesia Works.— The marine salt-works at Salt- 
coats, like all others on the west coast, have been materially in- 
jured by the introduction of English rock-salt from Liverpool, 
since the excise duties on salt have been repealed. Formerly, the 
English salt paid a higher duty than the Scotch, which prevented 
its importation ; but as it is produced at less expense, it is now 
sold cheaper. There only remain two salt-pans in operation, 
where there used to be seven ; and even these could not be em- 
ployed, if it were not that the country people prefer marine salt 
for their dairy, and give a higher price for it than for rock-salt. 
The salt-works manufacture at the rate of 200 tons of salt per 
annum, price L. 2, 10s. per ton; all consumed within about fif- 
teen miles of the place. 

From the bittern or mother-water of the salt-pans, and from 
other materials derived from the sea water, there is a considerable 

• Notwithstanding their blackamoor work, the colliers are cleanly in their habits, 
and undergo a complete ablution every day as soon as they rclurn home.

manutacture of viagnesia carried on by Mr Burns at Saltcoats, em- 
ploying a number of hands in its various manipulations. The pro- 
duce is mostly sent to London and New York, in wholesale, to 
laro-e drua-houses. This was the first established manufacture of 
the kind in Scotland, The wages given at the salt and magnesia 
works are about 12s. per week. 

Rope-Yard. — This was in a flourishing state when the former 
Statistical Report was written. It fell greatly off ; but it is now 
beginning to revive, giving employment to from six to eight hands. 
The introduction of patent machinery has been of great service. 

Ship-Building, when the former report was written, was in a 
most prosperous state in Saltcoats. About a year ago, there was 
great appearance of its becoming prosperous again ; and many car- 
penters were employed, but it is again at a stand. 

Trade and Shipping of Saltcoats. — In these also, we must record 
a great falling off. It is not easy to separate the trade of this 
harbour from that of Ardrossan. We may, in general, however, 
state, that there are about thirty vessels of from 20 to 250 tons re- 
gister, that trade from the port of Saltcoats, amounting to nearly 
3000 tons, and employing about 180 men. We find that in 1833, 
the value of exports to foreign parts between the ports amounted 
to about L. 600. The chief exportations, however, are to Ireland. 
In 1833, the value of earthenware exported was L. 325; of leather, 
L. 30; of herrings, L. 2423 ; of saddlery, L. 14 ; woollen manu- 
factures, L. 60 ; of freestone, L. 599 ; of coal, L. 7000. The 
trade has been gradually increasing since that time; and in par- 
ticular the exportation of freestone, and still more of coal, has great- 
ly increased ; and the exportation of coal to foreign ports has be- 
come considerable. Though there is no account kept of them, 
there are a number of wherries which come from the Highlands 
with herrings, &amp;c. and carry away coals to a very considerable ex- 
tent every week. 

The imports are chiefly from Ireland. Betwixt both harbours 
in 1833, the value of oats imported was L. 5293; of butter, L. 630 ; 
of limestone, L. 186 ; of beef and bacon, L. 76. In all, during 
that year, the imports from Ireland in value L. 6366 ; and the ex- 
ports to Ireland L. 10,202. There is a considerable importation 
of timber, but that seems chiefly to have come to Ardrossan. 

To save us from referring to it again, we may here briefly men- 
tion, that L. 1000 could be laid out to admirable advantage at 
Saltcoats, in deepening the harbour, and in extending the pier to 



462

the rock which is called the Little Nebbock. This would afford 
great protection, and would render the harbour an excellent one. 
It is the property of Robert Cuninghame, Esq. of Auchenharvie ; 
and we hope that the work which his enterprising ancestor, 150 
years ago, began, and which his public-spirited father considera- 
bly improved, he will have the honour ere long of bringing to a state 
of comparative perfection ; at once benefiting himself, and render- 
ing an important service to the community. 

Fisheries. — There is one boat employed in Saltcoats in supply- 
ing the town and neighbourhood with white fish. Stake-nets for 
salmon have been employed for some seasons, on the shore from 
Saltcoats to Irvine Bar ; but being much exposed, the nets suff'er 
so much from the storm, that the fishery cannot be carried on with 
great advantage. But the fishery was most successfully carried on 
the two last seasons, by means of bag-nets at the point of the quay. 

From six to eight vessels of from twenty to eighty tons, and em- 
ploying about fifty hands, go yearly from Saltcoats to the herring- 
fishery in the North Highlands. As they generally buy the fish 
from those who have caught them, fewer hands are required. Be- 
sides these larger vessels, a considerable number of wherries go from 
Saltcoats to the herring fishery in Loch Fyne, the Sound of Kil- 
brandon, &amp;c. At times, the herrings visit our own neighbour- 
hood; and it is a beautiful sight to see a large fleet of wherries as- 
sembled in our fine bay. The herring-fishery has fallen greatly 
off since the bounty was withheld. 

Saltcoats Brewery.— was established about fifty-six years 
ago, and it continues to furnish an abundant supply of ale, and 
porter, and small beer. Besides carrying on the brewery, Mr 
Watt is engaged to a considerable extent as a gram dealer. 

Stevenston Gmm-M7/.— This is an excellent mill, and of great 
antiquity, as we find from the old charters we have had occasion 
to peruse. 

Aqr■mdture.—mex the former Statistical Report was written in 
1791, the uncultivated part of the parish was stated as amounting 
to 1700 acres. Though no great efl-ort has been made, cultiva- 
tion, we are glad to find, has been creeping on with stealthy step. 
Much that was then called moor on Sea-Bank grounds, has been 
converted into beautiful parks ; and much that had the same wi d 
name of moor on Ardeer estate is now adding richly to the rental ; 
so that we may at present state the uncultivated land, in round num- 
bers, as amounting to 1200 acres. This, however, is a fnghtiul

number in so small a parish ; and it tells us that the sand-hills will 
not be subdued for more than a century to come, unless prompter 
measures are adopted. 

The number of Scotch acres in the parish is 3181. The ren- 
tal of the parish, as nearly as we can ascertain it, and the greater 
part of our information has been furnished by the proprietors, is 
L. 3836. Some of the land lets remarkably high. Fields of a 
few acres near Stevenston were this season, for one crop, let at 
L. 14, and even L. 14, 14s. per acre. They would not let 
so high, however, on lease, and allowance is made for that in mak- 
ing up the rental. Deducting the 1200 barren acres and their 
rent, and deducting about 154 acres in gardens, and plantations, 
and roads, the rest of the parish lets on an average at L. 2 per 
acre. The rental in 1791 was L. 1170; and the average rent 
13s. per acre. 

Raio Produce. — The farmers and others have kindly given us 
the information we asked, to aid us in making the foUowino- state- 
ment of the yearly amount of raw produce of the parish.

There are many other articles of raw produce, the value of 
which we have not been able to discover.. 

The number of farms in the parish is about 23. They are 
not of great size, being from twenty to rather upwards of a hun- 
dred acres. The more general size is from sixty to eighty acres. 
The rents, in proportion to the farms, vary from L. 40 to rather 
above L.200. The farmers are steady and industrious, but mak- 
ing, we believe, at present very small profits. The farm-houses 
are in general good. Hawthorn hedges, in almost all cases, form 
the inclosures. Stone-dikes give a hard and barren aspect to the 



464

landscape. They are best the day they are built, and from that 
moment are subject to the law of decay. 

The rotation on the richer lands is sometimes the three-shift, 
but more generally the four-shift. A large proportion, however, 
of each farm is in grass, arid there are some beautiful dairies in 
the parish. There is less cheese made here than formerly, as it is 
in general thought more profitable to dispose of the dairy produce 
in milk and butter. A few calves are reared each year, and the 
rest sent to market. 

There is still room for considerable improvement in agricultural 
matters in this parish. Little encouragement has yet been given 
for furrow-draining. A beginning, however, has been made, and 
we doubt not that it will spread over the whole parish, and add 
greatly to the value of property. 

The farms are let on lease of from twelve to nineteen years. Some 
are let from year to year. This may do for small patches around 
towns and villages; but for farms, it is a bad and comfortless 

system. p u 

Very considerable benefit is derived by the farmers from the 
sea-wracli, which in stormy weather is cast ashore, and diligently 
carted away by them for manure. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
There is both in Saltcoats and Stevenston a tolerably good 
market. If any day can be called the market-day, unfortunately, 
it is the Saturday. It is much to be regretted that this is the pay 
day in the public works, as those who are given to intemperate 
habits are thus more powerfully tempted to disqualify themselves 
for the duties of the approaching Sabbath, by making the Satur- 
day evening a night of riot and bustle, instead of calm domestic

Ecclesiastical State. — In entering on the ecclesiastical depart- 
ment of this Report, we shall, as far as the gnawing tooth of time 
has left us materials, give a list of the ministers of this parish. 

The first whose name we have been able to discover is Mr Stephen 
Wilkynsoune, curate of Steynstoune in 1547. We doubt not that 
he was a Roman Catholic. Our great Scottish Reformer Knox had 
begun to preach ; but having been among those in the Castle of St 
Andrews, who, after a brave and vigorous resistance, had been under 
the necessity of capitulating on honourable terms, he had been car- 
ried to France, and in violation of the terms of capitulation, was at 
this time a chained captive aboard one of the French galleys. The 
following extract from the records of the Commissary Court of Glas- 
gow gives us the name of this curate as witness to a will ; and in- 
forms us also, that our old church was dedicated to St Monach or 
Monk. Archibald Weyr, whose will is dated 7th October 1547, 
thus stipulates, " Do et lego, &amp;c.     corpusque meum 
sepeliendum Ecclesia Sancti Monachi de Steynstoune." " Tes- 
tis Dominus Stephanus Wilkynsoune, Curatus de Steynstoune." 

Mr James Walcar Walker is the next we meet. His name 
is found in the " Register of Ministers, as vicar and minister of 
Stivenstoune in 1567." His stipend is L. 40 Scots, or L. 3, 6s. 8d. 
Sterling, with " the thryd of his vicarage/' but the amount of this 
is not mentioned. 

In the Register of Ministers we find " Mr ArchibaM Crawfuird 
in Mr Walcar's rowme sen Beltym 1569 ; and 50 merkis mairsen 
the same tyme." And we find him again mentioned as minister 
of Stevinstoun in 1576, when his stipend was L. 100 Scots, or 
L, 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling, and probably with " the thryd of his vica- 
rage," which appears to have been a general grant about that time. 

The fourth we have fallen in with is " Maister Alexander Camp- 
hell, Personne, Minister and Viccar of the Paroche Kirk and Pa- 
rochine of Stinstoune" in 1606. We find his signature to a lease 
of the teinds of the parish, dated 1606. The original lease is in 
the charter-chest at Sea- Bank. Better had it been for this " Per- 
sonne's" memory, if this abiding litera scripta had been buried in 
the tomb of the Capulets. This lease shows that Mr Campbell

took a grassum, and let the teinds of the wliole parish to Hew 
Campbell of Hullerhirst, and Jeane Cuninghame, his spouse, for 
12 merks yearly, or 13s. 4d. and that during their joint lives, 
and for nineteen years after the death of the " langest liver of the 
twa." Hew Campbell was probably a kinsman, and he is de- 
nominated " kyndlie tacksman of the teinds, "and teind sheaves of 
the lands," This was an iniquitous transaction ; for though the 
incumbent " halds himself weiU payit and satisfeit," what was to 
become of his successor in office for nineteen years after the death 
of the " langest liver of the twa," with only 13s. 4d. in lieu of the 
whole teinds  It appears that tacks of this kind were often grant- 
ed in these days ; but being very prejudicial to the church, an act 
was passed in 1617, prohibiting prelates from granting tacks be- 
yond nineteen years ; and inferior beneficed persons from grantmg 
them for longer than their own lives and five years thereafter, un- 
less the tacks were registered in a particular register. And still 
farther, by Act 1621, cap. 15, all tacks by inferior beneficiaries, 
which had not the consent of the patron, were declared null ; so 
that « the kyndlie tacksman" would be relieved from collecting 
'« the teind and teind slieaves," sooner than he expected.  

The next whose name we have been able to discover is Mr John 
Bell. It appears from the following extract from Wodrow s 
Church History, that he lived till 1671. « June 22d, 1671 
John Bell, minister at Ardrossan, being " by act of a tyrannical 
council, " confined to his parish, his father living within a mde of 
him falls sick, and he must apply to the council to visit his dying 
father." They allowed him, indeed, but with « a proviso that he 
20 to no other house without his parish, coming and going t 

From the death of Mr Bell, there is reason to think, that, owing 
to the evils of tyranny and persecution, there was no mmister in 
Stevenston till 1689, when persecution and .f "S,;" 7;

to Paisley. The people of Stevenston then fixed on another of 
them, Mr Robert Stirling, who, at the request of the presbytery, 
agreed to exercise his ministry for some time among them ; and 
he remained at Stevenston, till times having become more peace- 
ful in Ireland, and having a call to return to his old charge, he left 
this parish, and returned to his own country. Though many efforts 
were made, and though in particular Mr Robert Murdoch was 
called and urged to become their minister, they seem to have been 
unsuccessful till 1700. 

In 1700, Mr William Reid was ordained minister of Stevens- 
ton, and continued faithfully to discharge his duty till 1742. He 
left many volumes of MS, sermons behind him, which bear evidence 
to the soundness of his doctrine, and the interest which he took in 
the spiritual welfare of his flock. He was the great grandfather of 
the present R. Cunninghame, Esq. of Auchenharvie. 

In the end of the year 1744, Mr Robert Finlay, afterwards 
the Rev. Dr R. Finlay, was ordained minister of this parish, 
and left it in March 1745, being only half a year here, and 
drawing no stipend. He went to Galston, and from that to the 
Ram's- Horn Kirk in Glasgow, St David's, and was afterwards 
appointed Professor of Divinity in the University of Glasgow. 
He was a person of very great learning ; and of the greatest worth 
and integrity of character ; and well entitled to a place among the 
distinguished persons connected with this parish. He lived to a 
great age, and sixty-seven years after he had left this parish, the 
present incumbent preached before him in Glasgow, and was con- 
gratulated by him as his successor. 

In 1746, Mr Thomas MacKindlay was ordained minister of the 
parish, and died in 1758, leaving with the charge of two children, a 
widow, who continued to be an ornament of the parish till 1824, 
when she died in her 93d year. 

In 1769, Mr James Wodrow, afterwards the Rev. Dr James 
Wodrow, was ordained minister of the parish. He was son of 
Wodrow, the celebrated Church Historian, and grandson of Pro- 
fessor Wodrow. He was a person of great respectability and up- 
rightness of character, and of high attainments ; and was thought 
to excel in lecturing. He died at an advanced age in Decem- 
ber 1810. 

David Landsborough, the present minister of the parish, a li- 
centiate of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, was ordained 26th Sep- 
tember 1811.

Church. — When this Statistical Report was first called for, the 
parish church was old. It is thought that the place round the pul- 
pit formed part of the church which was in existence in 1547, 
dedicated to St Monoch or St Monk. Happy are we that St Monk's 
Kirk has been laid low in the dust ; for though externally it was 
rather picturesque, internally it was most uncomfortable; and be- 
ing seated for 700, when the population was 3500, it was working 
the moral ruin of the parish, for hundreds grew up in habits of 
carelessness, which many of them, we fear, will carry to the grave. 
A most excellent church has now been built by the heritors, on 
the old delightful site. It is a very handsome and substantial edi- 
fice, with a steeple about 120 feet high, furnished with a good 
clock, and a fine-toned bell from London, 34 inches in diameter. 
Internally, the church is very convenient and comfortable, with a 
considerable degree of simple elegance. It has a stove for heat- 
ing it in winter. It is seated for about 1200, and is very favourably 
constructed both for the speaker and the hearers. Altogether, 
it is one of the best models to be met with for a country church. 
It is placed on a very commanding situation, 40 feet above the 
level of the village, and 63 feet above the level of the sea. 

The heritors have given up 136 sittings to the management of 
the session, to be assigned gratuitously to the poor, or, if not all 
required, to be let on easy terms in aid of the poor's funds. And 
easy, indeed, are the terms on which the sittings are let throughout 
the church, as the highest are only about 2s. 6d., and the greatest 
proportion of them only 6d. This is as it ought to be ; but it is ow- 
ing to 500 additional sittings being added at once by the new church. 

Manse, Sc. — The manse was built in 1787. Part of the old 
manse, built about 100 years ago, was allowed to stand, and forms 
the wing on the east. The manse was repaired in 1811, and a 
porch added in 1831, which, along with what has been done at the 
expense of the present incumbent, renders it a pretty comfortable 
house. The offices are thatched, and mean-looking. 

The glebe, including the garden, and site of the house, is 5 acres 
18 falls in extent. It is worth about L. 25 per annum. It would 
be worth more, had not part of it been let with consent of the hc- 
ritorsj about a hundred years ago, at a low rate, and on a very long 
lease, which, though not good in law, has been allowed to stand. 
The garden is of a superior order for a parsonage, well-walled, 
partly at the minister's expense ; stocked with tolerably produc-

tive fruit trees, and with a large assortment of rare and beautiful, 
but very unproductive flowers and plants. 

The stipend is 16 chalders, half oatmeal and half barley, with 
L, 10 for communion elements; and L. 4, 3s. 4d., the interest 
of mortified money, in the hands of one of the heritors ; and these 
sums being included, it has averaged these two years, since it was 
augmented, L. 229, 7s. 4d.-f- The stipend for the last three years, 
including money for communion elements, and L. 4, 3s. 4d., in- 
terest of mortified money, averaged L. 257, 7s. lOd. 

The number of communicants connected with the Establish- 
ment in the parish, is 980. The sacrament of the Lord's sup- 
per is dispensed twice in the season. The number who commu- 
nicate at one time is about 520. About 30 more livinar in Salt- 
coats attend, and communicate in the.parish church of Ardrossan, 
which is much nearer to them. 

In the Stevenston portion of Saltcoats, there is a United Seces- 
sion, and also a Relief Meeting-house. The ministers who of- 
ficiate in them are paid by public collections, and by the seat 
rents. The United Secession meeting-house is seated for 556. 
The Rev. Mr Ellis has informed us, that, besides occasional pre- 
sents of considerable value, he has never received less than L. 130 
of stipend, and four and sometimes five guineas, exclusive of com- 
munion elements, for defraying additional expenses incurred on 
these occasions. 

The Relief Meeting-house is seated for 650. The Rev. Mr 
Gilfen informs us, that besides sacramental and travelling ex- 
penses, and his pulpit supplied in his absence at the expense of 
the congregation, as Mr Ellis also has, the stipend promised is 

 The glebe being under the'legal size, a field, called the " Tinklers' Acre" was, with 
vacant stipend, purchased nearly eighty years ago, as an addition to it ; and this now 
forms the garden ; and what is called " the low-field" behind it. The adjoining field 
of the glebe is called the Bell Acre ; but why so, we leave future antiquarians to dis- 
cover. A bell-man, who was in office more than a quarter of a century ago, firmly 
believed that as it was called the Bell acre, it was intended that it should be a per- 
quisite of the Bell mans  

t About 1696, the stipend being small, and preachers scarce after a long season 
of persecution, the inhabitants of Stevenston could not for some years get a minister. 
As an inducement to a minister to settle among them, we find the elders of the pa- 
rish stating to the Presbytery, that if the heritors who had resolved to employ one 
year's vacant stipend in repairing the manse, and the bridge, for the old bridge was 
old, it would appear, even then, would condescend to mortify the said year's stipend 
for a supplement, the tenants would repair the said manse and bridge at their own 
charges. Two ministers having been appointed to speak to Gargunnockand the Lady 
Grange, if they would condescend thereto, they gave in their report, that they were 
willing to condescend thereto with a slight reservation. Notwithstanding, they could 
not get a minister till 1700, when Mr William Rcid was ordained.

All the places of worship in the parish are pretty well attended. 
The Dissenters draw their congregations from more than one pa- 
rish. When the last survey was made in 1836, the number of 
Dissenters in this parish was as follows : 

Relief, . 440 Baptists, . 31 Cameronians, 7 

United Secession, '227 Roman Catholics, 1 7 Methodist, 1 
Original Seceders, 31 Episcopalians. Total, . 781 

Education. — There are five schools in the parish ; one paro- 
chial school ; one supported by subscription ; and three supported 
by the wages. During the last six months, 163 have attended the 
parochial school. At the examination in December J 836, 122 
were present. Of the above numbers, all were learning English; 
41 writing; 17 arithmetic; 8 English grammar; 6 Latin; 4 ma- 
thematics.

The school-room is greatly too small, and in every respect bad, 
and we would reprobate it in the strongest terms, were it not that 
we believe the heritors are quite disposed to build one better suit- 
ed to the parish. 

There is another good private school in Stevenston. During 
the last six months 130 have attended it. The school fees are 
the samfe as in the parochial school ; and may amount, through- 
out the year, to about L. 48. About thirty attend evening classes. 

The free school in Saltcoats is called the Ladies' School, be- 
cause superintended and managed by a committee of ladies. It is 
for both parishes. The usual number who attend is about 30. 
They are all females, and are taught English, and knitting, and 
sewing. 

In two other private schools there are only 23 more at school 
in our side of the town, out of a population of 1466. Matters, 
however, are not just so bad as they look, for fully as many more 
from this parish are attending schools in the Ardrossan side of 
Saltcoats. Yet matters are far from being in so good a state as 
we would wish ; and we shall not rest satisfied till we have an en- 
dowed school, placed in some convenient situation in our side of 
the town of Saltcoats. 

We have two Sabbath evening schools in Stevenston, attended

by about 230 scholars; and two other schools in this parish in 
Saltcoats, attended by above 100 scholars. 

Litei-ature. — There is a good subscription library, of some stand- 
ing, in Saltcoats ; and also a public reading-room for both parishes. 
There is a good little subscription library in Stevenston : and a 
Sabbath school library, which has been found to be highly bene- 
ficial to the place. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor on the roll 
is 114; of these, 63 receive only occasional aid at the new- 
year, on sacramental occasions, and when known to be in difficul- 
ties. The remaining 51 are weekly pensioners, and receive from 
6d. to 2s. 6d. a week ; and many of them, in addition to their 
weekly pension, have their house rent paid, or receive some aid in 
paying it. The whole disbursements by the session last year, in- 
cluding the fees of tr'&amp;asurer, session-clerk, &amp;c., amounted to 
L. 223, 6s. 5d. To meet this, we had L. 96, 15s. 2d., collected 
at the church ; L. 5, a donation by a native of the parish on a visit 
from abroad; L. 12, Is. from proclamation and mortcloth dues; 
L. 1, 4s. 3d. from seat rents in church ; and L. 97, Is. 8d. as a 
voluntary contribution by the heritors. In point of collections for 
the poor as well as in many other respects, we are already expe- 
riencing the advantage of having a good church. During the last 
four years, 1828, 1829, 1830, 1831, the average of the annual 
collections in the old church was L.69, 12s. 7d. : during the four 
years since the church was rebuilt, the average of the collections 
for the poor throughout the year has been L. 89, lOs. 4d. And 
there is the prospect of increase, as the last year was considerably 
above the average, being L. 96, 15s. 2d. The collections during 
the last year 1836 for religious purposes, such as the General 
Assembly's Schemes, Sabbath schools, &amp;c. amounted to L. 49, 
10s. lOd., which is more than we ever had for these purposes be- 
fore. There is so much of the spirit of independence remaining, 
that there are few applications to the session till there is great need.

ported by quarterly subscriptions; and the funds are chiefly em- 

• The collections for the poor during the first year of the liev Mr Raid's minis- 
try, from 1700 till 1701 , including collections at an occasional Tluirsday lecture 
amounted to L. 72, 14s. Scots, or L. 6, Is. 2d. Sterling, whicii was more in proportion 
to the wealth and population of the parish than we collect now ; the population beinsr 
about 378, and the rental about L. 100 Sterling. The only extra collection that year 
was at New-yeav's-day, amounting to L. 2, 10s. 2d. Scots, for " the captives at AKirs " 
The chief extra parochial disbursement was L. 4 Scots money, being a year's salary 
to the presbytery bursar. In a subsequent year, the same sum is given to the Pres- 
bytery Highland bursar.— Session Records.

ployed in purchasing Bibles and tracts for distribution, and in pay- 
ing the school-wages of children whose parents are not paupers, 
but in straitened circumstances. The average expenditure of the 
last four years, in both parishes, has been L. 23, 6s. 8d., the half 
of which for this parish is L. 11, 13s. 4d. It has gone steadily on 
in doing good by aiding the Assembly's Schotjls, and missionary 
societies ; and by providing Bibles for the poor at home. The 
Saltcoats Stevenston Female Benevolent Society is a clothing 
society, supported by weekly subscriptions ; and their expenditure 
duringlast year was L. 22. Saltcoats  Stevenston Benevolent So-

Fairs. — There is a fair in Stevenston held on the 30th October, 
which is St Henoch's, or in English St Monk's day, or more ele- 
gantly as with us, euphonice causa, Sam-Maneuke's day. As far as 
I know, this fair is for nothing but drinking and revelry. There 
is a procession during the day, and a ball in the evening ; and per- 
haps neither procession nor ball would do much harm, were it not 
for the never-failing strong drink, which induces many to spend the 
greater part of the week of the fair in idleness and dissipation, and 
is an inlet to all manner of wickedness. 

A fair is held at Saltcoats on the last Thursday of May. 
About fifty years ago. Quay Street, on the fair day, had a long line 
of merchant's stands on each side; and the arrival of the fleet of 
Arran boats on the evening before the fair, was watched with de- 
light by the youngsters. Now, it is the day on which a number 
of the farm-servants are engaged for the ensuing half year, espe- 
cially such of them as come from the Highlands. It is likewise a 
cattle market, particularly for little Highland cows ; and also for 
pigs and lambs, &amp;c. 

Inns, Sj-c. — There are in the parish no less than thirty-three inns 



STEVENSTON. 



473 



and public-houses, and whisky shops. A few inns are needed for 
the accommodation of travellers, and for the transaction of busi- 
ness ; but the rest serve as so many decoys and traps to lure and 
destroy the thoughtless in their neighbourhood. The sale of spirits 
in grocer's shops has had a most pernicious influence, especially 
on the female part of the community, who, when there is no dan- 
ger of detection, are tempted to add a dram to the other commo- 
dities they purchase. But the most pernicious practice is that of 
several families clubbing, that they may drink together cheaply in 
one of their own houses ; for in this way husbands, and wives, and 
children, all share in the debauch, and drunken habits are per- 
petuated from generation to generation. 

We are grieved and ashamed to mention the sum annually ex- 
pended in this parish for ardent spirits. We have learned from 
the excise officer of the district, the quantity sold in it last year; 
and, without taking into account what is bought at a distance for 
the use of private families, and exclusive also of all that is expend- 
ed for wine, and ale, and porter and beer ; and calculating at a 
rate greatly below the retail price, the quantity of ardent spirits 
sold in the parish, — it amounts to the enormous sum of L. 4125    
This is truly lamentable. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

There is a great difference, in many things, betwixt the state of 
the parish now and its state when the former Statistical Report 
was written in 1791. 

Land is much higher rented than it was then, notwithstanding 
the great depreciation since the end of the French war. In 1791, 
the rental of the parish was L. 1170. Now it is L. 3836. This 
is not large for a whole parish ; but when we reflect that it con- 
tains only 3182 acres, and that about 1200 of these are sandhills, 
interspersed with patches of pasture yielding on an average only 
2s. 8d. per acre, it will appear, that what is cultivated of the pa- 
rish is one of the richest spots in the whole country. 

Facilities of communication have greatly increased. A great 
change has also taken place in trade ; the cotton trade, which now 
gives employment to so many families, being then only in its in- 
fancy. 

On the other hand, the trade of the harbour and ship-building, 
and the rope-work, and the salt-works are in a less flourishing state 
than they were then ; and Saltcoats, though it has increased in 



474 



AYUSllIIU;. 



size, has not increased in wealth ; and is not now as it was then, 
" the most fashionable sea-bathing place on the west coast." 

Though agriculture has made progress, the system of husbandry 
seems still capable of improvement ; and one improvement would 
be, a more extended system of furrow-draining over all the heavy 
grounds in the upper part of the parish. Thi, by ameliorating the 
soil and the climate, would render the crops earlier and more abun- 
dant ; and the pastures more kindly and nutritive. Another evi- 
dent improvement would be, determined and persevering hostility 
against the myriads of docks, and ragweeds, and nettles, and 
thistles which hold so prominent a place in many of our fields, 
wasting their strength, and rendering them unsightly. 

But the most magnificent improvement of which this parish is sus- 
ceptible is the fertilization of about 1200 acres of sandhills. That, 
in a few years, this barren range might be rendered not only beau- 
tiful, but of great value, is not an opinion of yesterday ; but was 
held forty-six years ago by the very intelligent and respectable 
writer of the last Statistical Report. There are two ways of im- 
proving this savage tract : the one by converting it into a forest, 
the other by bringing it into pasture, and eventually, perhaps, into 
arable ground ; for there is proof, in the parish, that it is capable of 
bearing trees, or of becoming rich pasture, and even of yielding 
good crops. The beautiful fields in the neighbourhood of Sea- 
Bank, and the glebe, were originally covered with sand.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. NINIAN BANNATYNE, A. M. MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name Cumnock seems to be compounded of the 
Celtic words com, a bosom, and conoc, a hill ; thus signifying the 
bosom of the hill ; which is strikingly descriptive of the locality, 
in which the town and church of Cumnock stand. It is now com- 
monly called Old Cumnock, to distinguish it from the parish of 
New Cumnock, which was disjoined from it upwards of a century 
ago. 

Boundaries, Extent. — The parish is in the middle district of 
Ayrshire, called Kyle, and is bounded on the west by Ochiltree ; 
on the north and east by Auchinleck ; and on the south by New 
Cumnock. It is of an oblong figure ; its length from east to west 
being 10 miles, and its average breadth from north to south 2 
miles. 

Topographical Appearances, Soil, and Climate. — The parish is 
partly flat and partly hilly, so as to present to the eye a very 
pleasing undulating surface, finely varied and adorned by nume- 
rous belts of wood, intersecting it in all directions, and giving a 
peculiarly rich and cultivated appearance to the entire landscape. 
The land is lowest on the north side of the parish, and rises gra- 
dually towards the west and south sides. There are no hills of 
any note in the parish ; the highest is called Knockdon, and stands 
on the south-west boundary. There are several very fine patches 
of holm land, lying along the banks of the river Lugar, some of 
which are of a light sandy soil, and others of a fine deep loam ; — 
on which wheat of excellent quality is raised. The soil, for the 
most part, is clayey, having a subsoil of strong till ; and on the 
higher lands, it is mossy. The p£,rish stands at an elevation of se- 
veral hundred feet above the level of the sea, from which it is six- 
teen miles distant; while, at the same time, it may be said to be 
embosomed among the higher lands of the surrounding parishes.

AYRSHIRE. 



The climate has its full share of the moisture of the western coast ; 
though, perhaps, not so wet on the whole as that of some parishes 
in tlie vicinity. It is, however, far from being unhealthy, which 
is proved by the very rare occurrence of epidemics, and likewise 
by the number of aged persons in the parish. 

Hydrography. — The water of Lugar rises on the east side of 
the parish, and is formed by the junction of the Glenmore and 
Bella waters, about two miles above the town of Cumnock. It 
forms the boundary between Cumnock and Auchinleck, passing 
the town of Cumnock on the north side, and taking a westerly di- 
rection until it flows into the Ayr water at Barskimming : thus 
running a course of about ten miles. The scenery on the banks 
of the Lugar is of the most romantic and picturesque description ; 
sometimes bold projecting naked crags overhang its course — at 
other places, is seen a perpendicular wall of rock, more than a hun- 
dred feet in height, rising'out of the water,— while again, you are 
called to admire the deep ravines through which it flows, wooded on 
both sides from top to bottom ; the trees now waving their foliage 
in the pure stream below, and again intertwining their branches 
on the heiarhts above. A little above the town, it almost forms 
a circle, by winding its course nearly round a small hill, called the 
Moat, which is finely wooded from the top to the bottom on all 
sides. The high and finely wooded banks, together whh the 
beautiful meanderings of the stream, as seen from this peninsular 
hill, present an extremely picturesque appearance. There is also 
another rivulet called the Glasnock water, that intersects the town 
of Cumnock, and flows into the Lugar, at the lower end of the 
town. This stream has its source in a lake that lies on the south 
boundary of the parish. It is worthy of notice, that this lake flows 
out at both ends. At its southern extremity, it sends its waters 
into two other small lakes in New Cumnock parish, that flows into 
the river Nith ; and at its northern extremity, it forms the Glas- 
nock water, which, as we have already said, empties itself mto the 
Lugar at Cumnock. From these facts, it is evident that this lake 
stands on the summit level between Ayrshire and Dumfries-shire ; 
while it also forms an inland link of communication between the 
friths of Clyde and Solway. And, indeed, from the presence of 
marine deposits, it seems not absurd to hazard a conjecture, that 
an arm of the sea, at some remote period, may have occupied the 
line of water from the Clyde at Ayr to the mouth of the Nith in 
Solway Frith. For, even as matters at present stand, we can sup- 



OLD CUMNOCK. 



477 



pose a trout to enter the Ayr water at the town of Ayr, pass from 
it into the Lugar at Barskimming, then again into the Glasnock at 
Cumnock, repose itself for a while, after its upward journey in the 
lake above-mentioned, and afterwards pursue its easy way down 
the course of the Nith, until it reaches the Solway. 

The la,te Earl of Dumfries at one time proposed making a cut 
from the river Nith in New Cumnock to the lake above mention- 
ed, in order to have a large supply of water for a factory that he 
intended to erect on the Glasnock water, and thus to make the 
Nith send part of its waters into the Clyde, instead of the Solway ; 
but it was never attempted to be executed. The cuts, however, I 
am told, could easily be made, and at very little expense ; but how 
the people of Dumfries-shire would relish this new order of things, 
in regard to the direction of their majestic river, I cannot say, — I 
am afraid they would forbid the bans between the Nith and the 
Clyde. 

Mineralogy. — The parish abounds in limestone, coal, and free- 
stone ; and it is also conjectured that ironstone may be found were it 
sought for. The limestone is of the first quality as a cement, 
making the best possible binding lime. It is known by the name 
of Benston lime, and hardens under water into the consistence of 
stone. Hence, it is highly valuable, and, consequently, much 
used in the erection of bridges and other buildings that stand 
under water. It is carried, I believe, to a considerable distance 
for subaqueous buildings. The direction of the dip is to the 
south-west. The cover consists of 28 feet of clay and 8 feet of 
bastard limestone. The strata of limestone are about 7 feet in 
thickness. The workmen earn about 2s. a day ; and the lime is 
sold at the quarry for 6d. per boll, Winchester measure. 

A freestone of a very superior kind is found on the banks of 
the Lugar of a light blue colour, and which takes a very fine polish 
in the hands of the mason. There is also a beautiful white free- 
stone, which is held in high repute, as making the very best mill- 
stones for grinding barley. It has been sent, I am told, even to 
America for this purpose. 

The whole parish may be said to rest on coal ; though, in many 
places, the seams are troubled and unworkable. It is wrought, 
at present, on the high lands tovyards the south-west side of the 
parish. Two beds of trap or whinstone intervene in sinking for the 
coal ; the one is 11 feet thick, and the other 4 feet ; the former 
is 8, and the latter 16 fathoms from the surface. There is a seam 



478 



AYRSHIRE. 



of coal, 2i feet thick, immediately under the lower bed of whin- 
stone. The direction of the dip is to the north-west, and the 
average thickness of the seam is about 4 feet. The quality of the 
coal is good, though sometimes a little sulphurous. A man will 
put out two tons of coal in the day, and will earn from 3s. to 4s. 
The lordship is a sixth of the gross out-put; and a fifth part of 
the coal is left for supports. There are few cross dikes. Some 
years ago, in sinking for coal, near the banks of the Lugar, a bed 
of marine shells was found, 14 fathoms from the surface, sunk in 
strong blue blaize. The shells were of the size of muscles, and 
were of a bluish-gray colour. A petrified shrub was also found in 
a bed of freestone, about 26 fathoms from the surface. 

Blind coal is also wrought in the same quarter of the parish, 
though higher up. The field is troubled and irregular, and not 
very extensive. It is sometimes intersected by cross dikes of 
free and whinstone. The dip is 8 fathoms, and its direction is to 
the north-west. The quality is good, and the thickness of the 
seam is 4 feet. It is used by millers for drying grain on the kiln, 
and likewise in hot-houses, because it emits no smoke when ignited. 

Zoology. — In addition to the common species of the feathered 
tribe, which we have in great abundance, — grouse, partridges, phea- 
sants, snipes, and wild ducks are also plentiful. Woodcocks like- 
wise visit us annually in considerable numbers. The black-cock 
has very much increased within these ten years, and is now plenti- 
ful, though very shy in coming within the range of the sportsman's 
fowling-piece. We have also the common horned owl, the screech 
owl with its gray plumage, and the white owl. The starling has 
begun to visit us lately, but is as yet a rare bird in this quarter. 

The lake already noticed abounds in pike, perches, and eels. 
There is also plenty of trout in the Lugar; and in former years, 
salmon used to come up in the end of the season, to spawn, in 
considerable numbers ; but now, few or none are seen, owing, I be- 
lieve, to a dam that has been made in the river at Ayr. 

The caterpillar does not seem to be so abundant, or so destruc- 
tive in its ravages, here, as in many other parts of the country. 

Jfood— Plantations. — The parish is well wooded, and the follow- 
ing is a list of some of the trees that are found in it ; oak, ash, elm, 
beech, plane, Scotch fir, spruce, silver fir, Weymouth pine. Balm 
of Gilead, saugh of many kinds, poplar, mountain ash, yew-tree 
holly, birch, sweet chestnut, horse chestnut, lime-tree, larch, thorn- 
tree, evergreen oak, crab-tree, Lombardy poplar, scarlet beech.

scarlet maple, scarlet chestnut, Italian maple, scarlet oak, white 
acacia, Norway maple, snake maple, cedar tree, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Some of these trees measure nearly 300 feet solid, while many 
of them are above 200 solid feet. 

II. — Civil History. 

The following account of the ancient history of the parish is 
taken from Chalmers' Caledonia. Cumnock was of old a rectory, 
the patronage whereof belonged to the proprietors of the barony of 
Cumnock. In the reign of David II. the barony of Cumnock, 
with the patronage of the church, belonged to Patrick Dunbar, 
the Earl of March, who resigned them in 1368 to his eldest son 
and heir, George, to whom, at the same time, he resigned the Earl- 
dom of March. George, Earl of March, resigned the barony of 
Jumnock, with the patronage of the church, to David Dunbar, 
who obtained a charter thereupon from the King in March 1374-5. 
In the fifteenth century, the rectory of Cumnock was converted 
into a prebend of the cathedral church of Glasgow, with the con- 
sent of the patron, who continued to hold the patronage of the 
rectory and prebend. After that event, the church of Cumnock 
was served by a vicar, who had a fixed stipend, and the remainder 
of the revenues of the church went to the rector, who was a canon 
or prebendary of Glasgow. There belonged to the church of 
Cumnock, lands extending to two merk lands of old extent, upon 
which stands the village of Cumnock. In September 1509, James 
Dunbar of Cumnock, the proprietor of the barony, and patron of 
the parish, obtained a charter from James IV. creating the church 
lands of Cumnock into a free burgh of barony, and granting li- 
cense to Sir Thomas Campbell, the prebendary of Cumnock, and 
his successors, to let the lands of his glebe in borough roods for 
building. In Bagimont's Roll, as it stood in the reign of James 
v., the rectory of Cumnock, a prebend of Glasgow, was taxed 
L. 16, being a tenth of its estimated value. 

Before the Reformation, there was a chapel on the lands of 
Borland in this parish, the vestiges whereof are still extant, and 
the farm on which it stood bears the name of Chapel-house. About 
the year 1612, the barony of Cumnock, with the patronage of the 
church, was sold by John Dunbar of Cumnock and Westfield, and, 
after passing through several hand§, it came, in the reign of Charles 
II., into the possession of the Earl of Dumfries. The barony 
and the patronage have continued since in that family, and be- 
long to the Marquis of Bute, who, as Earl of Dumfries, is patron

of both the parishes of Old and New Cumnock. In 1650, the ex- 
tensive parish of Cumnock was divided, and the soutliern division 
was formed into a distinct parish called New Cumrtoch, for which 
a new parish church was built. The northern division, containing 
the burgh of barony of Cumnock, formed the parish of Old Cum- 
nock. The old church remained till 1754, «when a new church 
was buili. 

Historical Notices. — It is related in the Life of John Welsh, mi- 
nister of Ayr, that about the year 1600, two travelling merchants, 
each with a pack of cloth upon a horse, who had been denied an 
entrance into Ayr, because Mr Welsh assured the magistrates that 
the plague was in their packs, had, on their being dismissed from 
Ayr, gone to Cumnock, and there sold their goods. There fol- 
lowed upon this such a plague in the town of Cumnock, that the 
living, it is said, were hardly able to bury the dead. There are 
still traditions of this melancholy event to be found among the 
people; and the place is pointed out where those who died of the 
plague are reported to have been buried, at a short distance from 
what was then the churchyard. But I have not heard of any re- 
mains of human bodies having been found there. 

Eminent Men. — The application of steam to the purposes of na- 
vigation, which is brought to such a high degree of perfection 
among us, owes its original invention to the late Mr James Taylor, 
who, for many years, superintended the mines on the Dumfries 
estate in this parish. 

Mr Taylor was living in the family of Mr Millar of Dalswinton, 
in the year 1787, when the latter gentleman made trial, in the 
Frith of Forth, of a vessel he had constructed with intermediate 
paddles, driven by a capstan. Mr Millar's experiment was very suc- 
cessful, in so far as the utility of the paddles was concerned ; but 
on seeing the men very much exhausted, by the labour of turning 
the capstan, Mr Taylor became convinced, that, in order to ren- 
der the experiment really useful, some other power must be ap- 
plied. He suggested the steam engine to Mr Millar, as a power 
that might probably be employed with advantage. An engine was 
accordingly constructed, and on the 14th October 1788, the ex- 
periment was made on the lake of Dalswinton, with a double boat, 
having an engine, with a four inch cylinder, placed on the deck. 
The boat was propelled by the engine, at the rate of five miles an 
hour. This was the first specimen of steam navigation in the 
world. For it was not until the year 1807, nineteen years after-

wards, that Mr Fulton introduced it into the rivers of America, nor 
until the year 1812, that Mr Henry Bell brought it into use on 
the Clyde.  

As too often happens, in similar cases, the name of the original 
Hiventor, has, in a great measure, been left in obscurity ; while the 
mvention itself has benefited, in the highest possible degree, not 
our country only, but the whole civilized world. 

It was thus, in a small obscure lake, in the south of Scotland, that 
that giant power was first applied to navigation, by an individual, 
now almost unknown,— which seems destined, at no distant period, 
to constitute the grand moving power in the navigation of the globe. 

Hugh Logan, Esq. of Logan, the famous Ayrshire wit, resided 
during the greater part of his life, on his estate in this parish ; and 
there is a stone, near to the house of Logan, which goes by the 
name of Logan's pillar, where, it is said, he was much in the habit 
of sitting, and cracking his jokes with those around him. His num- 
berless witticisms and sarcasms, which were oftentimes pregnant, 
not only with the most genuine humour, but likewise marked by 
an eagle-eyed discrimination, as well as an unsparing dissection 
of character, and conduct, are generally current among the people 
of this district, and form an unfailing source of amusement at their 
jovial meetings. But, from the frequent mixture of coarseness 
and profanity that interlard them, they have by no means contribut- 
ed to promote the interests, either of religion or morality, in the 
neighbourhood. 

The dust of the celebrated Alexander Peden slumbers within 
the precincts of Cumnock church-yard, and sheds a solemn sacred- 
ness around that abode of death, which enshrines it in the hallow- 
ed recollections of every Scottish Christian. For many have come 
far and near, to see the place where Peden lies, to read the time- 
worn inscription on his tombstone, and to view the two thorns which 
mark his last resting-place. Mr Peden was a native of the neigh- 
bouring parish of Sorn. A little before the Restoration, he was 
settled minister at New Luce in Galloway, where he continued 
about three years, and was then ejected by the violent tyranny of 
these times, because of his faithful and unbending allegiance to 
Christ's crown and covenant. He was first buried in the Laird of 
Auchinleck's aisle ; but after he had been forty days in the grave, 
a troop of dragoons came and disinterred his body. They brought 
it in its decaying putrid state to Cumnock, intending to have it

huno- up in chains on the gallows ; but, at the earnest intercession 
of the Countess of Dumfries, and the Lady Affleck, the Earl of 
Dumfries interfered, and told Murray that he had erected the gib- 
bet for murderers and malefactors, and not for such men as Peden. 
The body was therefore reinterred at Cumnock gallows' foot, be- 
side other martyrs. 

Antiquities.— The ruins of Terringzean Castle stand on a small 
rising ground, near to the banks of the Lugar, and within the 
pleasure grounds of Dumfries House. This castle once belong- 
ed to the family of Loudoun, and the present Countess is still 
styled Baroness of Terringzean. There are no traditions connect- 
ed with it. Some traces of an ancient ruin, called Boreland Castle, 
are also to be seen on the south side of the parish, and not very 
far from this castle, the vestiges of a small Popish chapel, are stdl 
extant. The small farm on which it stands is called Chapel House ; 
and has been occupied by the same family as tenants, in regular 
succession, for several hundred of years. 

There are several resting-places of the martyred dead in the pa- 
rish. Some he around Peden's grave, and mingle their dust with 
his One of the name of MacGeahan, lies in the farm of Stone- 
park, on the estate of Logan ; and there are three others whose 
dust reposes out in the moor, that forms the south-west boundary 
of the parish. New monuments have lately been erected over both 
of these ; as the former ones had become very much dilapidated. 

Land'-Owners.Theve are six heritors in the parish, namely, 
the Marquis of Bute; James Allason, Esq. of Glasnock ; W. A. 
Cunninghame, Esq. of Logan; MrsBoswellof Garallan ; Robert 
Campbell, Esq. of Skerrington; and Lieutenant- Colonel Camp- 
bell of Avisyard. Two of these reside permanently on their estates, 
two are occasionally resident, and the other two non-resident. 

Mansion-Houses.-mmhies House, the seat of the Marquis of 
Bute, is finely situated on the banks of the Lugar, over which a 
very elegant bridge is thrown, near to the house, m order to con- 
nect the beautiful pleasure grounds that stretch to a considerable 
extent along both sides of the river. The house is built with the 
fine blue freestone already spoken of, and is about eighty years ok. 
The walls of the drawing-room are hung with very fine old tapes- 
try, in a state of beautiful preservation, and said to have been pre- 
sented by Louis the Fourteenth to one of the Earls of Dumfries. 
The other mansion-houses are, Logan, Garrallan, and - 'f 
The last of these is a very elegant house, lately built, on the banks 



OLD CUMNOCK.

of the Glasnock. It is built of a beautiful white freestone, from 
a quarry on the banks of the Lugar. 

Parochial Registers.— The register of baptisms begins in 1704. 
There are blanks in it from 1706 to 1724, from 1739 to 1740, 
from 1746 to 1751, and from 1752 to 1753. 

The baptisms only are recorded up to the year 1768. After this 
period, the births also are, for the most part, entered along with 
them. A few only of the Dissenters register their children. The 
register of proclamations for marriage begins in 1758; but, up to 
the year 1782, no notice is taken of the marriages. Subsequent 
to this period, the date of the marriage is also entered. No regis- 
ter of deaths is kept. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish has been doubled since the year 
1765 ; while that of the town has increased threefold in the same 
period. The following is a view of it at five different periods : 

The population of the whole parish in 1755 was 1336 persons. 

1765, 1305 
1792, 1632 
1821, 2343 
1831, 2763 

The population of the village in 1 765, amounted to 580 persons. 

1831, . 1600 

landward in 1765, . 725 

1831, .1163 

From the above statement it appears, that, in a period of sixty-six 
years, the town has increased its population nearly threefold ; 
while the landward part of the parish has only added to its popu- 
lation, during the same period, little more than a half. The reason 
of this great disparity in the rate of increase between the town 
and country, is owing to the introduction, into the town, within 
the above period, of the manufacture of snuff-boxes, and also of 
weaving. 

The number of marriages in the parish averages 23 annually ; 
and the births range from 90 to 100. 

The people are, in general, above the middle size ; and are well 
formed and proportioned, in consonance with the old adage, 
" Kyle for a man." The plaid is universally worn, both by men 
and women, in summer as well as in winter. When tastefully put 
on, it contributes very much to give elegance of form and appear- 
ance, more especially to the female figure; which, perhaps, is 
one reason why the Ayrshire women are so much noted for their 
fine forms.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture— The parish contains about 13,000 Scotch acres ; 
500 of these are under plantation, and about 2000 are moor- 
land. The moorland, however, is now rapidly being brought into 
a state of culture. The rest of the parish is arable. 
' Wedge draining with turf has been a good deal employed m 
reclaiming the moorlands, and with great success. The Mar- 
quess of Bute has lately erected a tile-work on his estate here ; 
and has bound his tenants to drain a certain number of acres each 
year, in proportion to the extent of their farms. The system en- 
oi'ne'd on them is furrow draining,— the drains are to be made 
twenty-one inches deep, and, where the bottom is soft, the tiles 
are to be placed on soles. Lord Bute furnishes the tiles, free of 
expense, at the tile-work. The tenants are reqmred to cart them 
away, to cut the drains, lay the tiles, and cover them at their own 
expense This imperative obligation, laid on the farmers to im- 
prove their farms, accompanied as it is with such liberal encourage- 
ment on the part of the proprietor, affords the certain prospect ot 
a speedv and most beneficial change on the agricultural aspect ot 
the pari'sh. It will go to secure a general and uniform improve- 
ment over the whole of Dumfries estate, which forms the greater 
part of the parish, instead of its being confined, as heretofore, to 
detached farms, occupied by wealthy and enterprising farmers. 

Rent of Land, §-c.— The rent of land varies very considerably 
throughout the parish. It ranges from L. 4, for the land near 
the town, to 15s. or even 10s. per acre, for the high moorlands. 
The average rent of farms is about L. 1 per acre. The 
grazing of a cow in the vicinity of the town costs from L. 3 to 
L 4 • and it takes from one to two and a half acres of pasture for 
this purpose, according to the quality of the soil. The average 
pasture required for a cow is nearly two acres. Tlie cows are 
all of the Ayrshire breed ; and much attention has been paid of 
late by the farmers to the improvement of their stock. There is 
a local Farmer's Association, patronised by the Marqms of Bute, 
which awards annual premiums for the best specimens of milk 
cows in point of colour, form, beauty, and symmetry of proportions. 
There are some, indeed, who go so far as to say that there is a dash 

of blood in some cows. j ■ r fi 

The farmers depend chiefly on the produce of the dairy for the 
payment of their rents ; and a farm is considered l-gV'f 
the dairy does not provide for a considerable part of the rent. 



OLD CUMNOCK.

The cheese made in the parish will bear a comparison in point of 
quality with any in the district. 

The duration of the leases is from fourteen to nineteen years. 
In many cases, there is a break in the middle of the lease, that 
may be taken advantage of by either party. The rents are in ge- 
neral paid by a stipulated sum of money, though in some instances, 
they are paid one-third money, and two-thirds cheese and meal, 
according to the fiars prices. 

The farm-steadings, in general, are after the form of a continu- 
ous line of building, which is not the most convenient for dairy 
operations. Many of them are in good repair, while there are 
others that stand very much in need of being rebuilt. The new 
steadings are for the most part in the form of a square. The great- 
er part of the parish is enclosed with hedgerows. 

The wages of ploughmen are from L. 10 to L. 14 a year, and 
of dairy maids from L. 3 to L. 4 a half year. Labourers get from 
Is. 6d. to Is. 8d. a day. 

There are three corn-mills, and a wheat-mill in the parish, also 
a carding-mill and dye-work. 

The valued rent of the parish is L. 3864, 2s. 8d. The real rent 
is about L. 8000 Sterling. 

The total number of milk cows in the pa'rish is about 1000; 
and the average yearly produce of each cow is 11 or 12 stones tron 
of cheese. The number of sheep in the parish is from 1000 
to 1200.

Manufactures. — Cumnock has long been famed for the ingenious 
and beautiful manufacture of wooden snuff-boxes, which has been 
carried on in it, for the last thirty years. It rose from a very small 
and rude beginning to its present state of perfection. An ingenious 
artist of the name of Crawford caught the first idea of them from 
a box made at Lawrencekirk, which had been sent to him to re- 
pair. The distinguishing excellence of the Cumnock snuff-boxes 



48G 



AYRSHIRE. 



lies in the hinge, which is extremely ingenious in point of con- 
trivance, as well as exquisitely delicate in point of execution ; so 
that it is with much propriety styled " the invisible wooden hinge." 
The principle on which the hinge is formed, as well as the instru- 
ments employed in making it, were for many years kept a secret ; 
but are now no longer so. The wood used in the manufacture 
is plane tree, it being preferable to all others by reason of its close 
texture. The tree is first of all cut from the. centre towards the 
circumference into triangular pieces. These are then put to dry, 
and season, for at least five months, under cover. One set of artists 
make the boxes, another paint those beautifnl designs that em- 
bellish the lids, while women and children are employed in varnish- 
ing and pohshing them. The process of varnishing a single box 
takes from three to six weeks. Spirit varnish takes three weeks, 
and requires about thirty coats ; while copal varnish, which is now 
mostly used, takes six weeks, and requires about fifteen coats to com- 
plete the process. When the process of varnishing is finished, 
the surface is polished with ground flint ; and then the box is ready 
for the market. 

These ingenious and elegant specimens of art have been brought 
by successive improvement to an astonishing degree of perfection ; 
and the skill of the artists, sharpened and stimulated by keen ri- 
valry, is continually advancing this curious and beautiful manufac- 
ture to a higher pitch of improvement. At one time a single box, 
without either painting or varnishing, but just as it came from the 
hands of the maker, sold for 30s., whereas at present, seven such 
boxes can be had for 12s. A few years ago, a solid foot of wood 
that cost only 3s., could be manufactured into boxes worth L. 100 
Sterhng. And then the workmanship increased the original value 
of the wood nearly 700 times. But at present, a sohd foot of wood 
will only yield in finished boxes about L 9 Sterhng. The workman- 
ship thus only brings at present one-eleventh part of its former 

"in consequence of this great dechne in the price of the boxes, 
the wages of the artists have also been much lowered. A few years 
ago the box-maker made L. 1, Is. a week, the pamter L. 2, 2s., 
the'varnisher 12s.; whereas now the box-maker only makes 10s. to 
12s., the painter 15s., and the varnisher 5s. to 6s. a week. 

A system of chequering has now almost superseded the pamtmg 
of the boxes. It is done by very ingenious and nicely adjusted 
machines, that are worked by boys, and is much less expensive

than painting. Ingenuity creates endless and ever increasing va- 
rieties of cheques ; and many of them are most beautiful in pomt 
of pattern and figure, as well as of the most exquisite delicacy in 
point of colouring. 

The yearly value of the boxes made in Cumnock may average 
about L. 1600 Sterling ; while fifteen years ago, the same number 
of boxes would have brought L. 6000 Sterling. The total num- 
ber of persons employed in this manufacture is about 50. The 
period of work is eleven hours a day. 

There is a pottery in the town, in which brown ware of a very 
superior quality is made. Clay of the best kind is to be had in 
the parish. 

There is likewise a manufactory of thrashing-machines, cheese 
presses, &amp;c., in the town. The thrashing-mills made in it are of 
the very best construction, and are held in high repute through- 
out the west of Scotland. A considerable number are sent to Ire- 
land. 

Weaving in its various branches forms the chief manufacture in 
the town. When trade is brisk, there are more than 120 looms 
at work. 

Hand-sewing is also a common employment among women and 
girls, and they are very dexterous and tasteful in the execution of 
their work. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Town of Cumnock. — Cumnock was erected in the year 1609 
into a free burgh of barony, by a charter from James IV., and li- 
berty was given to the prebendary of Cumnock, and his succes- 
sors, to let his glebe in borough roods for building. 

Fairs, — There are several annual fairs held in the town. It 
has a baron bailie, who is appointed by the Marquis of Bute. 

The town of Cumnock is snugly and finely situated in a hollow, 
at the confluence of the Glasnock and Lugar waters. The prin- 
cipal part of the town is a quadrangular space, called the Square, 
formerly the burying-ground, but now the market place, which 
is surrounded by houses most of them of recent erection. In the 
centre of the square, stands the parish church. There are besides 
the square, three pretty long streets, in which there are some very 
good houses. The rest of the town consists of very narrow lanes, 
irregularly built. The town in general is pretty clean and health- 
ful. The beauty of its situation, combined with the picturesque 
banks of the Lugar, and the fine woodlands in the vicinity, to- 



488 



AYRSHIRE. 



gether with the striking effect produced by some fine old trees, 
rearing their heads among the houses, call forth the admiration 
of travellers. 

There are excellent shops of all kinds in the town. The Ayr- 
shire Banking Company has a branch established in it, and there 
is also a private agent of Hunters and Company. A gas work has 
been recently erected for supplying the town with light, which pro- 
mises to be of great public utility. 

From its central position in regard to the neighbouring parishes, 
a great deal of business is transacted in the town, much more than 
its size would lead a stranger to expect. It is a curious fact, that 
the four principal entrances to the town, on the east, west, north, 
and south side, are all down hill ; so that there is no descent from 
the town but the channel of the Lugar. 

Means of Communication. — There is a post-office in the town, 
and we have two arrivals of the mail daily, one from London, and 
the other from Glasgow. There are fourteen miles of turnpike 
roads in the parish. There are also cross-roads in all directions, 
which are kept in very good repair. A stage-coach from Glas- 
gow, and another from Carlisle, pass through the town daily. Cum- 
nock is distant from Edinburgh 60 miles, from Glasgow 37 miles, 
from Dumfries 46 miles, from Ayr 16 miles, and from Kilmar- 
nock 16 miles. There are 5 weekly carriers to Glasgow, 1 to 
Edinburgh, 6 to Ayr, 2 to Kilmarnock, and 3 to Dumfries. The 
road to Glasgow passes through Kilmarnock. There is a coach 
to Ayr twice a week. Post-horses, chaises, and cars, can be had 
in the town. 

There are 16 bridges in the parish, of which three are in the 
town. They are in general too narrow ; and the one over the 
Lugar has its arch at by far too great an elevation above the le- 
vel of the road. 

A plan has long been in agitation for improving the road from 
Cumnock to Ayr, which is now being carried into effect ; also the 
road from Kilmarnock to Sanquhar, passing through Cumnock, 
which stands in great need of an improved line. A survey has 
lately been made of the line from Carlisle to Glasgow, through 
Dumfries, Cumnock, Kilmarnock, &amp;c., and it has been found one 
of the most level lines for a rail-road to be met with. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The parish church was built in 1754, and 
stands in the centre of the town. The distance from the remotest 
parts of the parish is from five to six miles. It is in a state of pret- 



OLD CUMNOCK. 



489 



ty good repair, though too small for the accommodation of the pa- 
rish. It contains from 600 to 700 sittings. The heritors seem 
quite willing to enlarge the present church ; but there are diffi- 
culties in regard to the best mode of getting it accomplished. Se- 
veral plans have been laid before them with this view, but none 
of these has as yet been adopted. The parish church is in ge- 
neral well attended; though there are not a few in the parish who 
are very negligent in attending on the means of grace. The most 
remote in point of distance are in general the most regular in 
their attendance. 

The manse was built about the year 1750, though several ad- 
ditions have subsequently been made to it. It is very prettily situated 
on the banks of the Lugar, on the north side of the town ; and for 
an old house, it is in a tolerable state of repair. The extent of the 
glebe may be from 11 to 12 acres, but a part of it is not arable. 
The yearly value will be about L.20. The stipend is L.218 in 
money. 

There is a Dissenting church in the town, in connection with 
the United Secession, which may contain about 900 sittings. 
The number of communicants belonging to the Estabhshed 
Church is about 500. The collections made in the parish church, 
in behalf of religious and benevolent objects, amounted last year 
to the sum of L.29, 18s. ld. 

Nearly two-thirds of the population of the parish belong to the 
Established Church, and rather more than one-third are Dissenters. 

Education. — There is one parochial school in the parish. The 
averasre number of scholars in it will be about 100. Besides the 
ordinary branches, Latin and mathematics are also taught. The 
school fees are— 3s. for English reading, 3s. 6d. for writing, 
4s. for arithmetic, and 6s. for Latin per quarter of twelve weeks. 
There are also five private schools in the parish, and sometimes 
one or two additional during winter. There are very few above 
the age of fourteen who are not able to read and write, as parents 
evince a laudable anxiety to give their children the common 
branches of education ; and the Marquis of Bute pays for the 
education of twenty poor children, which is a great boon to the 
parish. The parish schoolmaster, in addition to the maximum 
salary, receives L.25 a year from a mortified fund left by a Mr 
Duncan, for the purpose of educating and providing with school- 
books, &amp;c. twelve poor children, natives of the parish. He is 



490 



AYRSHIRE. 



also provided with the legal accommodation. The probable yearly 
amount of shool fees is about L. 20. 

There are four Sabbath schools in the parish in connexion with 
the parish church ; three of which are in the country, and one in 
the town, consisting of nearly 300 scholars in all. There is a 
small library of religious books for the use of the scholars. 

Literature. — There are two public libraries in the town. 

Charitable Institutions — Friendly Societies. — There are three 
friendly societies in the parish, which seem to have done great good, 
not only in affording relief to the needy, but in cherishing a spirit 
of independence among the working-classes. 

The following table will give a view of their nature and operation.

besides 3d. a quarter. From L. 1 to L. 5 is allowed for funeral 
expenses, on the death of a member, besides a small allowance per 
quarter to his widow. 

Savings Bank. — There is a savings bank in the town, patro- 
nized by the Marquis of Bute ; and which is under the direc- 
tion of the heritors and minister of Old Cumnock, the ministers 
of New Cumnock and Auchinleck ; and of which the parish school- 
master of Old Cumnock is treasurer. It was instituted in 1831, 
and receives deposits from the parishioners of New Cumnock and 
Auchinleck, as well as of Old Cumnock. It owed its prosperity 
chiefly to the devoted attention of Mr Campbell, the treasurer. 

The stock on first January 1836 amounted to L. 810; depo- 
sits from that date till 2d January 1837, were L. 421, 9s. 4id. ; 
the sums drawn out during that period, L. 251, 9s. 4d. ; accu- 
mulated stock on the 2d January 1837, L. 980. 

The number of depositors during the year was 223 ; and they 
consist, for the most part, of male and female servants, though 
there is also a number of trades people among them. This insti- 
tution is likely to prove of incalculable advantage to the working 
classes. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number on the poor's 
roll is about 30, being about one pauper for every ninety-two 
individuals in the parish. The sum allowed to each per month 



OLD CUMNOCK.

varies from 3s. to 10s., according to the urgency of the case. The 
average sum is 5s. or 6s. each per month. The total sum 
distributed by the kirk-session last year was L. 105, 13s. 2d. 
The sources from which this sum was obtained were, church col- 
lections, L. 66, 12s. 6id. ; voluntary assessment on the heritors, 
L. 30 ; rent of some seats in church, L. 7, 16s. 

There is a mortification of L. 25 annually, under the manage- 
ment of the heritors and minister, which is given to needy persons 
who are not on the poor's roll. A large quantity of meal is;distri- 
buted annually by the Marquis of Bute, to poor persons in this 
parish, in regular allowance, once a fortnight. 

Either to ask or to obtain relief from the poor's funds is by no 
means regarded in so degrading a light as it was wont to be. 
There is a sad decline of late years in the spirit of independence 
that used to exist ; and relief from the kirk-session is now received 
more as a matter of legal right than as a gratuity. 

Pairs. — There are four annual fairs held in the town, in Fe- 
bruary, May, July, and October, O. S. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are two inns in the town, and thirteen houses 
where ardent spirits are sold. These latter have considerably de- 
creased within these four or five years ; but there are still by far 
too many of them, and their effects on the morals of the people are 
most injurious. 

It was very much the custom sometime ago to give half a dozen 
rounds, or more, of spirits, wine, &amp;c. at funerals ; but there has 
been a decided improvement in this respect, of late years ; and, in 
many cases, the giving of spirits is now wholly discontinued on 
such occasions. 

jPuel — Abundance of coal is to be had in the parish and neigh- 
bourhood. The price is about 5s. per ton at the pit ; and laid 
down in the town, about 8s. per ton.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JOHN M'EWEN, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The name of this parish, which is common to no fewer 
than five parishes in Scotland, is obviously derived from St Mi- 
chael, a saint of great note in the Romish Breviary, — who flourish- 
ed in the tenth century. 

Boundaries, Extent. — Its extent in imperial measure is 15,250 
acres. Its greatest length is 12 miles ; its greatest breadth 5 miles, 
6f th furlongs. It is bounded on the north and north-east by Dal- 
rymple ; on the east by Straiton ; on the south by Dailly ; and on 
the west and north-west by Kirkoswald and Maybole. 

Topographical Appearances. — The character of the parish is 
hilly. On the banks of the rivers and streams, there are consi- 
derable tracts of level ground ; but these bear a small proportion 
to what are unequal and undulating. The hill-pasture continues 
fresh and green, for most part of the season. In the upland farms, 
there is some little heath and moss, but no naked rock. The 
ground to the south from the Girvan Water continues to rise, 
with some interruptions, till it reaches the hill of Glenalla, which 
is 1612 feet above the level of the sea. The eminence above the 
farm-house of Guiltree-hill is well worth being visited. On the 
one side, are the Galloway and Straiton heights, with the rich 
and well -wooded valley of the Girvan ; and on the other, are seen, 
in still grander outline, the bold peaks of Arran, the bay of Ayr, 
and the towns along the coast, with the Highland hills and Ben- 
lomond in the distance. 

Climate and Soil. — The climate is similar to that of the districts 
situated on the western coast. The wind blows west and south- 
west, at least three-quarters of the year ; and the rain from the 
same quarter is proportionally frequent and copious. It is to this 
cause chiefly, that Ireland is indebted for her green fields, and

Ayrshire for its far-famed pasture. The atmosphere, tliough 
humid, is mild and salubrious. There are no prevaiUng diseases 
in the parish. Fever sometimes exists among the destitute poor, 
but seldom to any fatal extent. Pulmonary complaints, which are 
said to be so much on the increase in some places, do not seem 
to be so here. It is a fact now admitted by all, that the great 
improvement of land by furrow -draining, which has been so ex- 
tensively introduced into the district, has contributed materially 
to promote the general health of the community. The soil on 
the haughs, is a rich sharp mould, which, when properly cultivated, 
sends forth most luxuriant crops. In other parts, it is of a clayey 
nature, inclining to loam. On sloping arable lands, and on the 
sides of some of the lower hills, it is light and gravellish ; while 
on mountain elevations, it is a covering of thin turf, on a shingly 
bottom. 

The following are the number and probable size of the lochs in . 
the parish. Drumore contains about 9 imperial acres ; Kirkmichael, 
5 ; Barnshean, 28 ; Shankston, 12 ; Croot, 10 ; and Spalander, 
45 ; in all, 109 acres. Of these Spalander is justly celebrated 
for its trout, plentiful and good. Char also is found in this lake. 

Geology. — The prevailing rock throughout the parish is sand- 
stone ; and an examination of the dip and direction of the strata, 
in the courses of the Dyrock Burn and the Girvan Water, dis- 
tinctly indicates its character and geological relations. The Dy- 
rock flows through the northern part of the parish, in a south- 
westerly direction, and joins the Girvan, a mile below the village ; 
and in tracing its banks from the junction upwards, the sandstone 
strata are found to dip at an angle of about fifteen degrees to- 
wards the north-east, which inclination can be traced throughout 
the parish of Dalrymple, till they pass under the Coylton coal- 
field. Towards the east, the sandstone becomes much redder in 
colour, and harder in texture ; and the ridge at Guiltree-hill 
exhibits clinkstone or wacke. In crossing the country from the 
Dyrock to the Girvan Water, the sandstone near Glenside is 
found to change its inclination, and to dip away to the south-west, 
where it soon also passes into the wacke, and is, towards Patna, 
and more to the east, surmounted by the coal measures. The 
axis on which the sandstone turns, in opposite directions, is very 

 A small deduction ought to be made from this amount, on account of five acres of 
Spalander that belong to the neighbouring parish of Straiten — which, however, become 
entirely dry land in a burning summer like 1826.

distinctly seen on the Girvan Water, a little above the Castle of 
Cloncaird, and may be traced, exhibiting the same relative posi- 
tion to the coal measures, from Glenside to the sea, — circumstan- 
ces which plainly identify it with the old red sandstone formation. 

On the north of Spalander Burn, on the farm of Glenside, a 
ridge of highly crystalline greenstone rises through the strata, 
and the trap, in a similar way, may be observed at several points 
in the course of the Girvan. On the same farm, a bed of lime- 
stone is found, which has been quarried for agricultural purposes 
by Mr Ritchie, the proprietor. No organic remains have been 
noticed in it ; and along with the great and valuable strata of lime- 
stone found on the south side of the Girvan Water, on the pro- 
perties of Sir David Hunter Blair and William Niven, Esq. of 
Kirkbride, it is obviously, with the red sandstone, to be classed 
among the members of the carboniferous series. Good clay for the 
manufacture of tiles, is found near the lime- quarry at Glenside; 
and by his liberal use of these two important substances, Mr 
Ritchie has converted a naturally cold and barren tract into dry 
and fruitful fields, which in many cases exhibit as smooth and ver- 
dant a surface as the lower lands of the parish. In the wacke at 
Guiltree-hill and Montgomerieston, veins of galena are found, of 
sufficient importance to have been at one time worked ; and they 
are said to have yielded a high per centage of silver. The surface 
of the land, and more particularly along Barclay-hill, on the Kirk- 
michael estate, is covered with granite boulders,— some of which 
are of great magnitude, and are raised and dressed for gate- pillars, 
and as large blocks for the harbour of Ayr. The peculiar situation 
of the boulders on the eastern declivities appears to indicate a 
current from the south-east, which is exactly in the direction of 
the mountains at Loch Boon, where granite is found in situ. 

Hydrography.— The River Girvan nearly divides the parish. 
Rising on the hills of Barr and Straiten, it enters Kirkmichael be- 
low Blairquhan, and flowing past the seat of Henry Ritchie, Esq. 
beautifully situated on an eminence above, it reaches the village of 
Crossbill when, after a winding course of two miles, it forms the 
boundary between Dailly and Kirkoswald. From the Cloncaird 
approach, it has a very striking appearance, with its broad channel, 
and rapid stream, and banks embellished with wood rising precipi- 
tously on both sides. 

The River Boon, whose « banks and braes" have been immor- 
talized by the classic muse of Burns, touches this parish about two 



KIRKMICHAEL. 



495 



miles and a half below Patna. Passing the house, pleasure 
grounds, and gardens of Skeldon, the village of Dalrymple, and 
the old and stately mansion of Cassilis, it strikes to the west, 
dividing the parishes of Maybole and Dalrymple. 

The little stream of Dyrock takes its rise from Shankston loch, 
has a small tributary from Barnshean, and the main one from Spa- 
lander, and thence flowing by the church and village of Kirkmichael, 
it empties itself into the Girvan above the farm of Mackailston. 

11. — Civil History. 

Land-oioners. — The land-owners of the parish, according to the 
order of valuation, are : The Marquis of Ailsa ; Colonel Shaw 
Kennedy of Kirkmichael ; Sir Charles Dalrymple Fergusson, of 
Kilkerran, Bart. ; Sir David Hunter Blair, of Blairquhan, Bart. ; 
Henry Ritchie, Esq. of Busbie ; William Niven, Esq. of Kirk- 
bride ; the Honourable Mrs Leslie Cumming of Skeldon ; Wil- 
liam Bell, Esq. of Threave. 

Parochial Registers. — The sessional records were kept some- 
what irregularly, till about the year 171L The date of the 
earliest entry is 8th July 1638. The following extracts from 
the session books are given. Some of these possess merely local 
interest, while others serve to illustrate the sentiments of a former 
age, in matters of religious observance and church discipline. 

" In 1692, Mr Gilchrist, after the persecution, having consti- 
tuted a session of elders that had held office during Mr Cockburn's 
ministry, he then enquired into the old session book, which had 
been taken by the late curate, who had been apprehended in a 
rebellion in the north, imprisoned, and then escaped to France, 
and taken with him the register, which it was supposed he had 
destroyed." 

" Session, September 24, 1693. — The session appoints John 
Forgan to employ a Straitown tailor to make a coul or covering of 
sackcloth for the said Jonat Kennedy, like unto that which they 
have in Straiten ; there having been no such thing here for these 
many years, it's thought none of the tailors of this parish know 
how to make it." 

" Session, October 16, 1693. — The minister told the session, 
that he was appointed by the synod to goe to Aberdeen against 
the first of November next, and to preach in that city the space 
of a quarter of ane year." 

" Session, June 26, 1710. — Likewise it was concluded by the 
session, that there should be a collection gathered for repairing of

the bridge of Kirkmichael, which is hke to become ruinous, and 
the next two Sabbath collections that there is sermon here, is to 
be applyed for that use." Several bridges in the neighbourhood 
were built by the same means. 

A. D. 1711. Sermon on week days comimonly once a fortnight, 
" except in plough time and harvest." 

" Session, September 28, 1712.— Also the minister proposed 
that there should be a diet for prayer appointed, which was accord- 
ingly done, to be observed at the manse Saturday next." From the 
session books, it appears that such diets were appointed from time 
to time. There was, very frequently, one observed on the Mon- 
day before the sacrament. 

" Session, January 26, 1725.— This day David Armour con- 
tracted with the session to build the bridge over the Doon at 
Dalrymple for the sum of L.76, Is. Sterling." 

" Session, April 24, 1726. — The session having considered Sa- 
rah M'Kie's case adultery, agree that she appear in sackcloth, 
and that none guilty of that sin shall be dispensed with as to the 
use of sackcloth in time coming." For this offence she appeared 
eight times before the congregation, besides being as often ad- 
monished privately and examined by the session on the principles 
of religion, on the nature of repentance, &amp;c. 

Antiquities. — There are traces of five British or Danish fortlets 
in this parish, two in the farm of GuiUreehill, one in Keonston, 
one in Cassanton, and another in Castle Downans. They are all 
circular, and are supposed to belong to the early period of the 
fourteenth century. They are about 100 yards in diameter, with 
a ditch of near 15 feet wide ; on being ploughed up, fragments of 
pitchers, spears, horns, ashes, &amp;c. are everywhere discovered. 

The ruins of an old Romish chapel lately existed on the farm 
of Linsayston, opposite to the new house of Tannock Park. The 
last of the stones were taken, a few years ago, to fill drams. It 
is said to have been in connection with the Abbey of Crossraguel. 
The well is still known by the name of the Cl«ipel-well, and was 
contiguous to the building. 

In the troublous times of 1685, Gilbert M'Adam was taken

prisoner, and carried to Dumfries, on a charge of non-conformity, 
but was liberated on a heavy caution being given. Soon after, he 
was again apprehended, and, refusing the oath of allegiance and 
supremacy, he was banished to the Plantations. In the course 
of the same year, however, he contrived to return, and, late upon 
a Saturday night or early on Sabbath morning, in a cottage near 
the present House of Kirkmichael, when, with some of his friends at 
a meeting for prayer, he was surprised by a company of militia, and 
shot in attempting to escape by a window. In the church-yard, a 
tomb-stone was placed over his remains, with an epitaph recording 
the circumstances of his death by the " Laird of Colzean and 
Ballochmyl." By some hand these two names were erased. Old 
Mortality, however, took care to re-insert them, and they now re- 
main as legible as the original lettering. In 1829, a new tomb- 
stone was erected, in which the old tablet is preserved. 

Cassillis House, the property of the. Marquis of Ailsa, is a fine 
old building, romantically situated on the banks of the Doon. It 
sdems to belong to the middle of the fifteenth century. An excel- 
lent addition was made to it, in the year 1830, when it was fitted 
up for the late Earl. There is, besides, an extensive lawn, on 
which there is great abundance of timber. 

Under the body of the castle, there is a large subterraneous 
apartment, with a secret door leading to it. Some years ago, this 
place was cleaned out,with the view of making it a wine-cellar. In 
this process, a great many carts of human bones were removed. 
These, it is to be feared, were the lingering witnesses of deeds and 
times long gone by, when the devoted guest and the refractory 
vassal went so frequently missing, having met a fate which some 
might suspect, but none durst inquire into. 

Sir John Faa. — This place was the scene of the story of Sir John 
Faa, and furnishes the ground-work of a popular ballad.f About the 
middle of the seventeenth century, the Lady Jane Hamilton, 
daughter of the Earl of Haddington, was betrothed to the young 
knight of Dunbar, but a more tempting offer having been made 
in the person of John Earl of Cassillis, she was desired by her fa- 
ther to break up lier former engagement. According to the spi- 
rit of the times, the feelings of the young lady in such an alliance 
were little consulted. She was treated as if she were not a party

concerned, or only a marketable commodity to be made over to 
the highest offerer. But Lady Jane was not to be so easily ma- 
naged. Neither the threats of her ambitious father, nor the im- 
portunities of her noble suitor, could divert her affections from the 
object of her first attachment. 

Having considered a great many plans, it was finally arranged 
that Sir John should go to the continent under a solemn pledge of 
returning in a few months. Two full years, however, passed with- 
out furnishing any intelligence of his situation. This circumstance 
naturally induced the behef that some dreadful calamity had be- 
fallen him,— a supposition which seemed to be confirmed by a let- 
ter from the English ambassador at Madrid, giving assurance of his 
death by the hands of some bravos. Upon receiving this intimation, 
the lady at last reluctantly yielded her hand to the Earl of Cassillis. 
This nobleman was a person of stern and forbidding presence, and 
of that haughty and imperious temper that might create awe, but 
was ill fitted to awaken confidence and affection. Finding that his 
Countess preferred sohtude and the musings of a gloomy melan- 
choly to his society and pleasure, he conceived for her, if not a 
violent dislike, at least a settled indifference. She accompanied hiro 
in none of his travels, nor shared in any of his pastimes. He con- 
tinued to attend his public duties, or to pursue his schemes of am- 
bition, while she remained for months at home, dejected and heart- 
broken, without friend or attendant. 

While leading this miserable life, one evening, as she was taking 
her accustomed walk on the battlements of the Castle, she descri- 
ed a band of Gipsies making with haste to the house. Such bands 
were very common at that period, but the number and the suspi- 
cious appearance of this company were calculated to create consider- 
able alarm, the more especially as the Earl was from home attend- 
ing the Assembly of Divines at Westminster. On approaching 
the house, however, instead of offering violence, they commenced 
some of those wild strains, by which they generally succeeded in at- 
tracting the notice, and exciting the hberal.ty of those to whom 
they appealed. The Countess was in the act of dropping from 
her window the usual gratuity, when all at once she recx,gnized in 
the leader of the Gipsies the tall commandmg figure of Sir John 
Faa An intervew immediately ensued, and the mysterious cause of 
his absence was fully explained. He had been confined for ur 
vears in the Inquisition, on account of some unguarded expiession 
Te L used respecting the Church of Rome. Upon his enlarge-

ment, he instantly hastened to London, where he learned for the 
hrst time of the marriage of Lady Jane. After many persuasions 
and great hesitation on the part of the Lady, she at last consented to 
fly with him. They had not, however, well set out, when the Earl 
most unexpectedly arrived with a powerful retinue of vassals, who 
had assembled to welcome his return, and accompany him home as 
a guard of honour. Being informed of what had taken place, he 
called his retainers, who had just alighted, to remount and pursue 
the fugitives. The whole party, headed by the Earl, now mad- 
dened with rage, and burning to repay the ancient grudge he owed 
his former rival, speedily overtook, and after a short encounter, 
captured the desperate knight and his wretched companion. On 
being carried back. Sir John and his followers were halted at a tree 
of dismal notoriety, well known by the name of the dule dolor 
tree ; while the Lady was taken to a room, from which she was 
compelled to witness her gallant and his associates strugghng in 
the agonies of death. This room still goes by the name of the 
Countess' Room. The lady was afterwards sent to Maybole, where 
the family had a winter residence, and confined there for life. 
Her picture, which is said to be a correct likeness, hangs at present 
in the lobby of Cassillis. A large full tear appears falling from 
her eye, too sadly descriptive of her melancholy fate. The dule 
tree, a plane of great expanse and beauty, still flourishes on a little 
knoll at the entrance to the castle. The ford where Sir John and 
his party crossed the Doon is known to this day as " The Gipsies 
Steps." 

Family of Kennedy.— The family of Kennedy held the ascend- 
ant in feudal times over an immense district, — from Wigton to the 
town of Ayr, — and the name of Cassillis, it is well known, appears 
conspicuous in many details of Scottish history. As both the old 
residence and title are derived from this parish, it may not be impro- 
per to subjoin a few particulars in connection with the early origin 
of the family, and its subsequent advancement to wealth and honour. 

The first notice we have of this ancient house is in 1220, when 
Nicol de Carrick granted the Church of St Cuthbert, at Maybole, 
to the nuns of North Berwick. His son, Roland, several years 
after, obtained a charter from Neil, Earl of Carrick, which in a. d. 
1276 and 1372, was confirmed by Alexander HL and Robert H. 
respectively. This deed is intituled " Confirmatio Johannis Ken, 
nedy," which makes a change of name from Carrick to Kennedy, 
a Gaelic compound signifying the head of the house or family. 



5QQ AYllSHIUE. 

The earUest mention of the lands of Cassillis is contained in a 
writ given by King David II. to Sir John Kennedy about the year 
1360 in which that monarch confirms to the knight the donations, 
grant's, and venditions made to him by Marjory Montgomery, and 
laer daughter, of the lands of Castlys, in the county of Ayr. Soon 
after the wealth and influence of the family were greatly advan- 
ced by the marriage of Sir James Kennedy to the daughter of Kmg 
Robert III. Gilbert, the second Earl of Cassillis, was a man of 
splendid talents, and was employed in several offices of high trust. 
He was assassinated at Prestwick, by Hugh Campbell, sheriff ot 
the county. His son, Quintin, abbot of Crossraguel, is famous for 
the dispute which, for three days, he maintained with Knox at 
Maybole. His zeal and learning in behalf of his faith so much 
gratified the Romish clergy, that on his death he was publicly ca- 

Giltert, the third Earl, was the pupil and intimate friend of the 
celebrated George Buchanan. The bitter satire that Buchanan 
vrote against the Franciscan friars, was composed during his resi- 
dence at Cassillis. 

John the sixth Earl, was an ardent friend of the Protestant cause 
in oene'ral, and of the Church of Scotland in particular. He was 
one of the three ruling elders sent to the Assembly of Divmes at 
Westminster in 1643, to ratify the solemn league aud covenant. 
His wife was the ill-starred lady who figures in the matter with 
Sir John Faa. His daughter, a lady of distinguished piety and ex- 
cellence, was married to Bishop Burnet. 

His son, the seventh Earl, was the single person who lifted up his 
voice against the act for punishing conventicles. This indepen- 
dent line of conduct was so offensive to the ministry, that he was 
denounced an outlaw, and forced to flee from the countr 

Under the act of abolishing heritable jurisdictions m 1747, John, 
the eighth Earl, was allowed L. 1800 for the regality of Carrick, 
in full of his claim of L. 13,000. 

Modern Man.i«n..-Cloncaird Castle, the residence of Henry 
Ritchie, Esq. of Busbie, was originally in the style of feudal man- 
sions of the sixteenth century, having a huge square tower narrow 
spiral staircase, &amp;c. In 1814, an entire new front was built which 
now renders it, both from site and exterior one of the handson est 
seats in Ayrshire. There is a large stretch of lawn m f.ont, and 
plenty of fine old trees adjoining. Kpnnpdv

is an excellent and commodious family residence. Contiguous is 
a natural lake of five acres extent, which shows to great advantage 
from the house. The extensive and judicious improvements lately 
made on the grounds will serve to beautify a spot, in itself of great 
natural amenity. There are some splendid trees within the policy, 
and very thriving plantations throughout the estate. 

There is a local tradition, besides some proofs from ancient do- 
cuments, that Blairquhan is within the original land-marks of this 
parish. Convenience, no doubt, suggests the propriety of its be- 
longing to Straiton, and possibly, in this way, the old parochial 
connexion may have been altered without further title or deed of 
annexation, ecclesiastical or civil. The main part of the beauti- 
ful approach to the castle, along the banks of the river, is within 
the present admitted boundary of the parish.

IV. — Industry. 
The number of acres standard imperial measure, in the parish, 
is 15,250; of which there are under wood, natural and planted, 
1130. Five hundred acres might, with a profitable application of 
capital, be added to the cultivated land.

Jleni of Land. — The valued rent amounts to L. 3829, 4s. 
Sd. ; the real rent to L. 9330. The rent of good haugli 
land is about L. 2, 2s. per acre. The grazing of a cow for 
the season is L. 3, 3s. ; of a sheep, 8s. The general duration of 
leases is nineteen years. Furrow-draining is extending as the good 
effects of it are observed. The farm-steadings are, in general, 
slated, comfortable, and commodious. 

Agricultural Improvements. — It is worthy of mention, that the 
person who, forty years ago, gave the first stimulus to farming en- 
terprise in this place, was the Rev. John Ramsay, the incumbent 
of Kirkmichael. He was the founder and the first President of 
the Carrick Farmers' Society, which flourishes to this day, rich in 
funds, and numerous and respectable in members. Although many 
local Associations of this nature now exist in the country, this one 
deserves special notice, from its early formation, and from the emi- 
nent success that has attended its exertions, in exciting an honour- 
able emulation among farmers, and in otherwise promoting the in- 
terests of husbandry in the district. 

As an enlightened and enthusiastic agriculturist, this parish sus- 
tained an irreparable loss in the premature and lamented death of 
the late Earl of Cassillis. The same activity and ardour which 
made his name so illustrious in sporting life, were no less conspicu- 
ous, when turned to more useful and important purposes. In a very 
short time, the whole appearance of the lands under his manage- 
ment was changed ; new breeds of cattle and sheep were introdu- 
ced ; the most approved modes of farming in all its branches were 
adopted ; and improvements, in a style and to an extent never be- 
fore attempted in Carrick, were skilfully and successfully prosecuted, 
when death put a sudden stop to his operations. No event of the 
kind overproduced, in the neighbourhood, so sincere and universal 
lamentation. 

Mr Ritchie holds the first place, in this part of the country, as 
an improver of land ; and his experience unites with that of other 
enlicrhtened land-owners, in establishing the fact, that no outlay ot 
capital yields so high and certain a return, as what is judiciously 
applied to the purposes of agricultural improvement. 

The estate of Kirkbride, the property of William Niven, Esq. 
on coming to its present proprietor, was a wild, bleak, barren 
moor. By means of suitable enclosures, numerous belts of wood, 
ample ficilities for lime, drains, &amp;c. the soil has been brought com- 
pletely under cultivation, and now produces most luxuriant crops.

while the elegant farm-houses which have been erected convey 
to the mind of the beholder the pleasing impression of hberality on 
the part of the landlord, and domestic comfort on that of the 
tenant. 

About thirty years ago, the proprietor of the barony of Dalhoan 
commenced feuing on one of his farms in the heart of his estate, 
with the view of increasing his rental, and raising the value of land 
in the neighbourhood. This undertaking happened to be enter- 
ed upon at a most favourable time, during the war, when manu- 
factures were in a very flourishing condition. A large influx of 
wanderers from the other side of the water caused the high rents 
to be maintained, and houses to be still more in demand. In this 
way fresh encouragement was given for new buildings. A great 
proportion of the inhabitants of Crossbill, 800 out of 1000, are 
either Irish or of Irish extraction. In many instances, it must 
be confessed, they exhibit the too common characteristics of 
their countrymen, indolent, improvident, and passionately ad- 
dicted to spirits and tobacco. At the same time, it is but doing 
them justice to say, that they have visibly improved in these re- 
spects. They are beginning to appreciate the excellence of quiet 
and orderly habits, and can now spend, in healthful exercise and 
rational amusement, those hours that were previously consumed in 
degrading sloth or sensual indulgence. Not a few take a'pride in co- 
pying the example of their Scottish neighbours, have a wish to pos- 
sess a suit of better clothes for Sabbath, and to appear like other 
people at church. 

Manufactures. — The manufacture of cotton is the staple trade 
of the place. The large Glasgow warehouses appoint agents here, 
who give out the cotton to the hand-loom weavers, and are respon- 
sible for its manufacture into the required fabric. By this means, a 
large sum of money is transmitted weekly from Glasgow to the coun- 
try. Children are put to the loom, as early as the age of ten. Wo- 
men are frequently as expert weavers as men. Females who have 
not been brought up to weave, make a livelihood by filling bobbins. 

There is another very extensive branch of industry, — the Ayr- 
shire needle-work, which is executed in this village, in avery superior 
style. It is a valuable means of employment, and furnishes decent 
support to many respectable females, yet it is to be feared that the

Through the kindness of an esteemed friend, Mr Alexander Kennedy, now in Austra- 
lia, the use of his father's papers was very obligingly allowed.

continual confinement, which is indispensable in order to a subsist- 
ence, will prove much more injurious to health than if the work 
were harder, and the person more exposed. 

The proprietor of Cloncaird, forty years ago, made several at- 
tempts by boring for coal, but without success. This spring, a 
similar trial was made by the Marquis of Ailsa on the Cassillis 
lands, but with no better result. 

Qitarries. — There is an excellent freestone quarry at Balwhirn, 
the property of William Niven, Esq. There are few parishes where 
there is such an abundant supply of lime. The following is an ab- 
stract of the number of bolls sold at the respective places in a season.

Clonclaugh, although unexhausted, has been closed for several 
years ; Glenside has never been worked to any extent. There is an- 
other quarry, Trochain, on the Cloncaird estate, which has been 
found to contain a substance exceedingly pure and in great abun- 
dance. 

Mr Ritchie erected a tile-work in 1832, which has been of great 
service to the country. The annual supply of tiles has reached 
the sum of 330,000, which has, nevertheless, been always short of 
the demand. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Kirkmichael is three miles from Maybole and ten from Ayr. 
The vjllage contains 560 inhabitants ; Crossbill, 1005. 

A daily post arrives from Maybole at noon, and leaves at five 
in the afternoon ; Kirkmichael carrier goes to Ayr twice a week ; 
Straiten carrier passes the village to Ayr twice a week ; Newton- 
Stewart carrier to Glasgow once a week ; Crossbill to Glasgow once 
a week ; Glasgow to Kirkmichael and Patna once a week ; Crossbill 
to Ayr, two carriers twice a week ; Dailly carrier through Crossbill 
to Ayr twice a week. There is, besides, a covered cart for pas- 
sengers on the market days to Ayr. 

For the admirable state in which the roads of the district are 
kept, much praise is due to our excellent surveyor, Mr Reid. In 
Kirkmichael, there are twenty-six miles of turnpike, ten miles of 
parish roads, and five toll bars. 
• Of this parish Chalmers says, it was called in former times 
Kirkmichael of Gemilston, evidently a corruption of Gemmil, which 
is still a prevailing name in Ayrshire ; and in Latin charters, it was 



KIRKMICHAEL.

described as " Ecdesia Sancti Michaelis de Gerailstoii. The 
church was granted to the prior and canons of Whithorn by John de 
Gemilston, and confirmed to them by Robert 1. in May 1325. In 
James V., the vicarage of Kirkmichael, in the deanery of Carrick, 
was L. 3, 6s, 8d. being a tenth of its estimated value. In 1562, 
the half of the vicarage was enjoyed by Sir Thomas Montgomery, 
the vicar of the church, who received from it L. 15 yearly, and L. 5 
more as the rent of the glebe-lands and manse. How the other 
half of the vicarage was disposed of, -appeareth not. But the tithes 
and revenue of Kirkmichael, which belonged to the priory of 
Whithorn, were leased to Jonet Mure, for the payment of L. 100 
a-year. The church of Kirkmichael, with the other property of 
the priory, were vested in the King by the general annexation act 
of 1587. The whole was granted by the King in 1606 to the 
bishops of Galloway. In 1641, it was transferred to the Univer-- 
sity of Glasgow, but it was restored to the same bishop in 1661 ; 
and it was held by the bishops of that see till the final abolition 
of Episcopacy in 1689, when the patronage was vested in the King, 
to whom it now belongs." 

The church, with its romantic burying-ground, is beautifully si- 
tuated on the Dyrock burn, and surrounded by a row of old and 
majestic ash-trees. The position is well chosen, for the conve- 
nience of the people generally. The family farthest from church 
on the southern extremity, is seven miles and a-half distant, and 
the one on the northern extremity is five miles distant. The 
church was built in 1 787, contains accommodation for 556 persons, 
is a substantial house, and in good repair. 

A new manse has just been built. It is after the style of the 
old English manor-house, and is in exact keeping with the charac- 
ter of the place. It is a happy change from the common manse 
form, and is equally creditable to the liberal spirit, and the ex- 
cellent taste of the heritors. The contract price without offices 
was L. 968, 8s., which, considering the nature of the building, is 
thought exceedingly moderate. 

The glebe contains 16 acres, and, after a little improvement by 
draining, may run from L. 2 to L. 3 per acre. The stipend was 
last year augmented to 17 chalders, half-meal, half-barley, with 
L. 10 for communion elements. , 

Ministers of Kirkmichael. — The following are the ministers of 
this parish since the Reformation, — Mr Roger Melville ; Mr Wil- 
liam Peebles, ordained 1638; Mr William Cockburn; Mr Wil- 



506 



AYRSHIRK. 



liam Irvine, curate during Episcopacy ; 1692, Mr James Gilchrist; 
1711, Mr James Lawrie ; 1765, Mr John Ramsay; 1802, Mr 
David Kennedy ; 1835, Mr John M'Ewen. 

There are only three sittings or half a pew provided by law for the 
whole population of Crosshill. To remedy so great an evil, measures 
have been adopted to erect a new chapel, which commenced this 
summer, and is expected to be opened for public worship in a few 
months. The two chief proprietors of the village. Sir Charles 
D. Fergusson, and Mr Niven, have come forward and generous- 
ly put forth their hands to this good work. At the same time Mr 
Smellie, an active and talented young preacher, has, for two years, 
been employed in preparing the field. 

However deeply the religious and well disposed part of the com- 
munity felt in the success of this undertaking, their best exertions 
must have been altogether vain, unless aided by the ready and 
Christian munificence of one whose professions of attachment to the 
church harmonize at all times so beautifully with his personal sa- 
crifices and labours to promote its extension and efficiency. The 
church looks well, and is a great ornament to the neighbourhood. 
It will cost from L. 700 to L. 800, and is to contain 460 sittings 
without a gallery. 

The great body of the people adhere to the Establishment. 
By a census made in 1836, with a view to answer the queries of the 
Religious Instruction Commission, it was found that the total in- 
habitants of the parish amounted to 2856 ; of which number be- 
longing to the Establishment were 2567 ; Dissenters, 172 ; Catho- 
lics, 117. 

The average number of communicants is about 650. 

Education. — There is one parochial school in the parish. The 
average attendance of pupils runs from 60 to 70. The teacher 
has the legal accommodation with the maximum salary. The 
fees average L. 30, but are very ill paid. The usual branches of edu- 
cation are taught, and at the usual rates. 

The former proprietor of Crosshill built a large school-house for 
the benefit of the village. There is a small salary paid by the 
feuars to the master, amounting at present to L. 3, 10s. The 
school has lately been connected with the General Assembly's 
Scheme. The average attendance is about 70. From the po- 
verty of the inhabitants, the payment of the school wages is 
wretched in the extreme. 

There are, besides, Sabbath schools for children, adults, and 



KIRKMICHAEL, 



507 



young communicants, both at Kirkmichael and Crossbill. The 
attendance at the former may be about 120, at the latter 130. 

Friendly Societies. — Two friendly societies were established, in 
the year 1811. They were both founded on the principle of giv- 
ing 8s. weekly, when the patients were confined to bed, and 4s. 
when walking about. On the death of a member, each surviving 
member contributes Is. towards defraying the funeral expenses. 
The age of admission is from the age of sixteen to thirty. In 
process of time, one of the societies perceived that their allowances 
were too liberal, and reduced them accordingly — 5s. when confin- 
ed to bed, and 2s. 6d. when walking about; and, if confined to bed 
for more than a year, to receive only 2s. 6d., and when walking 
about 2s. per week. This Society is in a very flourishing state, 
having about ninety members, and funds amounting to L. 220. 
The other society, by keeping too long to its original rules, and 
admitting members up till the age of forty, was obliged to break 
up a few months ago. Associations of this kind are of immense 
advantage in establishing habits of economy, and exciting an ho- 
nourable feeling of independence. They cannot be too strongly 
recommended to the young tradesman and labourer. 

Library. — A parochial library has just been established, which, 
from the interest taken in its formation, and the good judgment shown 
in the selection of works, promises to be eminently useful in extend- 
ing and fostering a taste in the district for wholesome and instruc- 
tive reading : A committee consisting of 12, with a librarian, are 
elected annually as trustees and managers for conducting the af- 
fairs of the library, according to the fundamental rules of the in- 
stitution. There are from 30 to 40 subscribers. There is no 
entry money. A penny a week paid quarterly or yearly is the 
term of admission for each member. 

Savings Banks. — Two savings banks have been established in 
the parish ; but it is to be lamented they have not been available 
in securing those important benefits, to the people, which were 
the object of their institution. 

Poor. — The number on the poor's roll is 16, who have, ac- 
cording to their necessities, from 2s. 6d. to 8s. per month. A 
considerable number, however, although not on the roll, receive 
assistance pretty regularly, and in. various shapes, in coals, cloth- 
ing, victual, rent, &amp;c. The annual collections at church, amount 
to about L. 40 ; proclamation and other dues, to L. 10. There 
are two mortifications for the poor, the one, left in 1678, by one 



508 



AYRSHIRE. 



of the lairds of Kirkmichacl, of 1200 merks Scots ; the other by 
the Rev. James Gilchrist, in 1710, of 1000 merks Scots. These 
two principals have been mortgaged on the estate of Kirkmichael, 
and the interest arising therefrom, L. 5, 6s. 8d., is payable to the 
kirk-session on demand. Whatever deficiency exists, after these 
funds are exhausted, the heritors agree to supply by making a 
voluntary contribution, according to their respective valuations. 
The whole expense of managing the poor may be set down at 
L. 97 per annum. This sum, of course, varies with the state of 
trade, the price of living, the number of orphans, the health of the 
people, &amp;c. 

With the native population, there is yet much although wearing 
out of that fine old Scottish feeling that scorns a state of depen- 
dence, and regards a subsistence from the poor's box as a reproach 
to themselves and their kindred. But there are not a few, espe- 
cially of the manufacturing class, who have no such high-minded 
sentiments, who are neither very anxious to secure a competence 
for themselves, nor very moderate in their demands on others. 

Alehouses 10, — a number unwarrantably large, required neither 
for the accommodation nor the good morals of the community. 

Mills. — There is a large saw-mill on the Girvan Water, erect- 
ed by the enterprise of Mr John M'Lymont in Balsaggart, and its 
operations are conducted under the judicious management of Mr 
James Dunlop. It has brought wood on the adjoining proper- 
ties to a ready market. Attached to this is a bone-mill, which, 
from the extended use of this manure, has been no less service- 
able to the public at large, than it has been convenient to this 
neighbourhood. There is one lint-mill in the parish. The an- 
nual quantity of flax dressed is 200 stones. There are likewise 
four corn -mills in the parish. 

Fuel. — Peat is used as fuel only in one farm in the parish. The 
distance of the nearest coal-pit is five miles, where a ton of coals 
or 20 cwt. costs 4s. ; and the price of a cart of coals of five creels, 
or 12 cwt. laid down at Kirkmichael, tolls and cartage, is 4s. 7d.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. MATTHEW KIRKLAND, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
-Extent, Boundaries. — The parish of New Cumnock, lying at 
the south-east extremity of Ayrshire, was separated from Cum- 
nock in the year 1650. Its length from east to west averages 12 
miles, and its breadth from north to south 9 miles. It is bound- 
ed on the north, by the parishes of Auchinleck, Cumnock, and 
Ochiltree ; on the west, by Dalmellington ; on the south, by Cars- 
phairn and Dairy in Galloway ; and on the east, by Penpont, San- 
quhar, and Kirkconnel in Dumfries-shire. 

Topographical Appearances. — Its surface is hilly, and towards 
its southern boundary chiefly mountainous. The valley of the Nith, 
which stretches from west to east nearly the whole length of the 
parish, is the lowest ground in it, and is about 500 feet above the 
level of the sea. The beautiful valley of the Afton, lying north 
and south, is about 50 feet higher. The highest mountain, Black- 
craig, has an elevation of 1600 feet above the valley of the Nith ; 
the Knipe, to the south of this, 1260 ; and Corsancone, 872. This 
last hill, from its position, commands a beautifid and extensive 
view of the surrounding country. 

Meteorology. — The clouds frequently rest on the tops of the 
hills, and thick mists often settle in the valleys, so as to appear from 
the higher grounds like a vast sheet of water. By these, the in- 
habitants are enabled to prognosticate with great certainty the ap- 
proach of rain. Thus it has become a proverb, " If Corsancone 
puts on his cap, and the Knipe be clear, it will rain within twenty- 
four hours." This sign, it is said, never fails. 

The climate, owing to the large extent of mossy and unculti- 
vated land, and to the marshy nature of the valley of the Nith, 
is rather moist; and, consequently, agues and fevers are said, in 
former times, to have been prevalent diseases. The culture of 
the land, and the open drains that have been cut along the sides 



510 



AYRSHIUK. 



of the pasture-hills, have of late years much improved the climate, 
so that these diseases have now almost disappeared, and the parish 
is now remarkably healthy. 

Hydrography. — Springs, notwithstanding the hilly surface of 
the parish, ■ are not very numerous ; several of them are strongly 
impregnated with iron. There are three small lakes in the parish, 
each about half a mile in circumference. The first, close upon 
the border of Old Cumnock, is remarkable for emptying its waters 
in two opposite directions. The other two, in a straight line 
south, lie at the distance of about a quarter of a mile from each 
other. They are of no great depth, and possess but little interest, 
except for the perch and pike with which they abound, the water- 
fowls which frequent them, and the excellent fields of ice which 
in winter they aflbrd for the sport of curling. 

The River Nith rises in the south-west extremity of the parish, 
and, after running for about two miles in a northerly direction, 
turns directly eastward, and, at the foot of Corsancone, falls into 
the parish of Kirkconnel, where what is called Nithsdale com- 
mences. It is about fifteen feet broad, generally shallow and slug- 
gish, and its colour deeply tinged with moss. It has a course 
within the parish, of about twelve miles. The Afton, a rapid and 
beautiful stream, rises at the southern boundary of the parish, 
and, flowing in a northerly direction, after a course of eight miles, 
falls into the Nith, at the east side of the village of New Cum- 
nock. 

Geology and Mineralogy.— The following account of the geo- 
logy and mineralogy of New Cumnock has been furnished by a 
gentleman who has given much attention to the subject, and who 
has had the best opportunities of prosecuting his inquiries. 

The parish is a large valley or basin, in which the river Nith 
has its source. It is joined at the village of New Cumnock by 
the water of Afton ; and the united streams enter the county of 
Dumfries, through a narrow ravine at Corsancone-hill. This val- 
ley is bounded on the south by a ridge of hill, composed of transi- 
tion-rocks, of considerable altitude, as the Nippes, Blackcraig, &amp;c. 
which are chiefly graywacke. This ridge of graywacke runs along 
the south side of the river Nith. On the east, the valley is bound- 
ed by a ridge of volcanic breccia, or tuflfa, consisting of large and 
small rounded balls cemented together, which commence at Cor- 
sancone, running east into Dumfries-shire, and also forming a cir- 
cle towards the north, through the upper parts of the parish of 



NEW CUMNOCK. 



511 



Aucliinleck. This basin is nearly isolated, being bounded on the 
west by a ridge of basaltic hills, which commence at Benbeoch, 
near Dalmellington, and terminate near Benstone limestone quarry. 
This ridge appears to run over the coal-formation, a narrow neck 
of which is seen passing between the basalt of Benbeoch and the 
greywacke and breccia hills of Meiklehill, &amp;c. into the coal-field 
of the Doon, near Dalmellington ; and upon the western side of 
this ridge, at Knockdon, a seam of five feet of anthracite, or blind- 
coal, is found under the basalt. 

In the greywacke hills, galena or lead ore is found in veins, and 
has been wrought to a considerable extent on the Afton estate ; 
but the works have been given up many years ago. Several trials 
have been made for lead in the Nippes. Trials have been made 
for slate in a dike of schistus, which traverses the Nippes from 
east to west. A dike of porphyry is seen crossing the Afton, near 
Laight, and running in the same direction, through the greywacke 
hills, and crosses the Glasgow road near the county march. This 
dike is of a reddish colour ; but, when in contact with the breccia 
rocks of Corsancone, it becomes black, and is used there for road 
metal. 

The central parts of this valley are filled up with the coal-for- 
mation. The dip or . inclination of the strata is exceedingly irre- 
gular, generally dipping from the sides of the hills that surround 
the valley. The strata are also very much broken and confused, 
by dikes, slips, and hitchesintersecting them in all directions, some- 
times altering the position of the beds of coal, lime, and freestone 
for many yards, and sometimes only a few feet. The general line 
of dikes is from east to west, and they often change the inclination 
of the strata. 

The carboniferous limestone is found in great abundance, all 
over this parish, cropping out near the foot of the hills on every side 
of the valley. There are several beds or posts of great thickness. 
The same bed of limestone-rock, about 12 feet deep, is wrought at 
Benstone, Mansfield, and Polquhortor ; accompanied with several 
beds of shale, containing a considerable portion of lime, called by 
the workers fahes. Under this post, there are other beds of lime- 
stone, in smaller seams, as that wrought at Nether Polquhortor 
and Park. At Lanehead, the limestone rock occurs, consisting of in- 
numerable beds standing quite on edge. This hmestone again oc- 
curs on edge at Polquheys. The mode of working these quarries 
is by opencoat, removing the surface and beds of shale, freestone, 



512 



AYRSHIRE. 



&amp;c. from the out-crop of the limestone rock, the base of which may 
in general average from 10 to 18 feet deep. The limestone rock 
is then easily quarried, being in beds of from 1 to 4 feet in thick- 
ness, and intersected by upright joints. The expense of quarrying 
may average L. 1, 10s. per 100 bolls of two imperial bushels. 

All the shells and organic remains usually found in the carbo- 
niferous limestone, occur in the Hme rocks of this parish ; speci- 
mens of the ConiMartmmoiis have been found in Mansfield limestone 
quarry. A bed of shell-marl or limestone about 2 feet appears in 
connexion with the limestone rock at Mansfield House. This bed 
is again seen at Polquhortor and at Knockburnie, four or five 
miles above New Cumnock, near Lanehead limestone quarry, which 
proves the individuality and continuation of the strata, which seem 
to be in connection with the basalt. Limestone is also wrought 
at a considerable elevation at Corsancone, where it crops out on 
the side of the breccia hills. This rock is about 25 feet in depth, 
it is compact, and has the appearance of primitive limestone, and 
follows the same course as the breccia through the upper part of 
the parish of Auchinleck. This limestone may be said to be in a 
solid mass ; it contains no fossil nor organic remains. This may 
have been originally the carboniferous limestone, but by coming 
into contact with the volcanic breccia, and reduced to a state of 
fusion, may have entirely obliterated the organic remains and stra- 
tification. The mode of working this rock has been, for many 
years, by mining. The whole rock, from its compactness, requires 
to be blasted with powder. This limestone is burnt in draw-kilns, 
and the lime carried into the parishes of Kirkconnel and Sanquhar, 
and used by the farmers as a manure. About 25,000 bolls of two 
imperial bushels are sold annually. All the lime quarried in this 
parish, is burnt at the quarries in draw-kilns, and sold to the far- 
mers in the neighbouring parishes for a manure. 
The quantity burnt annually is,

Lime-Kilns. — The lime-kilns in this parish, with the exception 
of those at Mansfield, are of the same construction as those gene- 
rally used throughout the country, about 20 or 25 feet deep, 20 
feet wide at top, and 2 or 3 feet wide at bottom, with one, two, or 
three eyes, only large enough to admit a shovel. Those at Mans- 
field, erected by Sir Charles G. S. Menteath, Bart, of Closeburn, 
are of a better construction, being about 30 feet deep, 6 feet diame- 
ter at top, 8 feet at the middle, and 5 feet at the bottom, and lined 
with brick. The lime in the kiln is supported on movable iron bars, 
1 foot apart, placed in front on a cast iron frame, upon which doors 
are hung to regulate the draught of air through the kiln. The lime 
is brought down through the iron bars by a poker upon a grate, 
from which the lime is filled into carts, and the small lime and 
ashes fall through this grate into the ash-pit. From this construc- 
tion of a lime-kiln, a great saving of coal is effected, and the lime 
better burnt. Fire in a lime- kiln having a tendency to rise per- 
pendicularly, and rather contract than expand at the top, a great 
quantity of the lime in a wide topped kiln at the sides, is left un- 
touched by the fire, and consequently much unburnt stone, and 
waste of coal and labour. 

Sandstone or freestone occurs in every part of the parish, gene- 
rally of a yellowish white colour, and coarse grain irregularly strati- 
fied. In the lower parts of the valley, the sandstone is more regu- 
larly stratified, and contains great quantities of fossil impressions. 
There are several quarries of freestone for building in the parish. 

Ironstone occurs in bands and balls, in great quantities in the 
coal formation ; but has never been wrought. 

Coal. — The coal formation at Mansfieldforms an isolated basin, in 
the eastern part of the parish, in which six seams of coal have been 
ascertained, and in whole are about forty feet in thickness. The 
upper seam is fine cannel-coal, two feet six inches thick ; at five 
fathoms deeper, thirty-three inches of dross coal ; the next seam 
is the nine feet coal, in the middle of which there are sixteen inches 
of smith's coal. The twelve feet coal is separated from the nine 
feet by strata of freestone fahes, which form a wedge between 
the two coals from north to south, being only a few feet thick at 
the north point, and upwards of thirty feet, at two hundred yards 
south. In the centre of the twelve" feet seam, there are sixteen in- 
ches of cannel coal. The next seam, five and a half fathoms deep. 
er, is the eleven feet coal, all splint, and a four feet coal has been 
ascertained to lie under this. In several places, the seams of coal 

AYE. K k 



514 



AYRSHIRE. 



unite and form one entire bed of coal. The cannel coal is much 
in demand for making gas, and is used at Dumfries and at Ca- 
trine. The dross coal makes good coke, and is used at Ayr, Kil- 
marnock, and Catrine foundries. The out-put is about 8000 tons 
annually, chiefly carried into Dumfries-shire. 

At Coalburn, a three feet seam of coal is wrought, and another 
of six feet at Creoch, both on the banks of the Nith above New 
Cumnock, where several smaller seams occur. Smith's coal, of 
excellent quality, is wrought at Craigman and Auldna, in the up- 
per part of the parish ; the seam is about three feet deep. The 
out-put of these works may be estimated at 3000 tons. 

At Straid, near the road from Dalmellington to New Cumnock, 
a seam of cannel coal is wrought about three feet thick, accom- 
panied by eight or ten inches of dross coal. This cannel coal is 
much in demand for making gas. It lies very near the grey- 
wacke,andin the immediate neighbourhood of the Afton lead mines. 

In the coal formation at Craigman, plumbago or black-lead 
occurs, and has been wrought for a long period. The plumbago 
here appears to be formed by basaltic rocks, coming in contact 
with a seam of six to eight feet of columnar coal. In examining 
this mine, the whole process of the conversion of the coal into 
plumbago is evidently from volcanic agency. The basalt, when 
in a state of fusion, bursting up through the coal metals and mixing 
with the coal, has charred or dandered the coal, and also con- 
verted it into plumbago. The seam of coal, when nearly in con- 
tact with the basalt, is completely charred for ten or twenty yards, 
in different degrees of hardness, as it .approaches nearer the basalt. 
The plumbago is found in irregular masses, imbedded in the ba-. 
salt, and has often the same columnar structure as the coal. A 
further proof of the volcanic action is a bed of slate-clay, which 
forms the roof of the coal, and when in contact with the basalt is 
raised up unbroken, and converted into a silicious substance, like 
porcelain jasper; and in the section of the rocks at the entrance 
into the mine, a piece of this jasper, about two feet long, and six or 
eight inches thick, has sunk down several feet into the basalt, which 
must have occurred when the basalt was in a state of fusion. 

Soil—T\\Q soil of New Cumnock, upon the south side of the 
Nith, is rather of a gravelly nature, formed of the debris of the 
greywacke hills, &amp;c. Frequently, large boulders of granite and 
sienite occur in the ground, although none of the hills in the neigh- 
bourhood are formed of these rocks. The north and west sides are 



NEW CUMNOCK. 



515 



generally composed of a clay soil, incumbent upon the freestone 
of the coal formation. 

The bottom of this valley through which the Nith runs, has 
evidently, at an early period, consisted of several lakes both in the 
upper part of the parish, as at Dalgig, and in the lower, as at and 
below New Cumnock. There are still three small lakes above New 
Cumnock, the highest of which discharges one half of its waters 
mto the Nith, and the other runs towards Old Cumnock and Ayr. 
These lakes, in course of time, have been filled up by the debris of 
the hills being washed down, and the growth of moss, and the lower- 
mg of the channel of the river. They are now flat meadow lands, 
having generally a fine alluvial soil, from one foot to ten feet deep, 
reposing upon peat moss. These meadows are very much ne- 
glected and covered with stagnant water, the greatest part of the 
year; and consequently the hay produced is of the coarsest quality. 
F rom the extensive exhalation from these swamps, fogs and frost 
are produced which must be hurtful to the health of the people, 
and injurious to the climate and the crops. 

Improving of Meadows. — Great improvements have been made 
upon the meadow land of Mansfield by Sir Charles G. S. Men- 
teath of Closeburn. The plan adopted in improving these mea- 
dows, and for the purpose of irrigation so apphcable in this dis- 
trict, has been, after taking two white crops, to throw the ground 
into beds or ridges with the spade, forty-five feet wide, and one and 
a half raised from side to centre, the most pointed attention being 
paid to the level : a drain or furrow, fifteen or eighteen inches 
deep, is cut between every ridge, which serves all the purpose of 
drains. In order to apply the water, large feeders, from three to 
. six feet wide, are cut round the head-ridge ; and small feeders are 
cut on the top of each ridge to communicate with the large or 
main feeders, about eighteen inches wide at the upper, and dimi- 
nishing towards the lower end of the ridges, to cause the water to 
overflow of itself, and fall into the furrow. These meadows are 
sown out with the most approved permanent grasses, generally a 
great portion of Timothy and Yorkshire fog, with a little rye-grass. 
In this parish, great extent of meadow land is still in a state of na- 
ture without a single drain to carry off" the superabundant water. 
This is by no means a remarkable circumstance, as little attention 
is paid to the improvement of meadow land in any part of Scotland. 
Upwards of 150 acres are finished in this way, and a considerably 
greater extent is in operation. This is the only eff"ectual way of 



51G 



AYRSHIllE. 



improving very flat meadows and laying them dry, and introducing 
the system of irrigation. 

Zoology ■ — There are scarcely any species of remarkable ani- 
mals in the parish. Hawks occasionally build their nests on the 
high rocks near the head of the Afton. Foxes also abound in 
that district, which are eagerly destroyed by the inhabitants, on 
account of their ravages among the sheep. Black game are to 
be found on the hills on the south side of the Nith. Grouse and 
partridges, with pheasants, are to be met with ; but, not being 
carefully preserved, are not in great abundance. 

Salmon are found to reach very near the Nith at the spawning 
season, which is in the month of October. Trout are abundant in 
the Afton, in the rivulet of the Lane, and in the water of Deuch, 
which divides the parish from Galloway. Pike and perch abound 
in the lakes formerly mentioned. 

A few years ago, a remarkable swarm of insects, resembling the 
caterpillar, traversed a great part of the hills on the south side of 
the parish, proceeding southwards and devouring every green thing 
in their course. The crops often suffw severely from the ravages 
of the grub. 

5oiaz/.— Several beautiful species of fern are found on the 
banks of the Afton. Some rare species of plants, in particular, 
the Bhodiola rosea, grow on the Stey Amry, a high rock near the 
source of that stream. 

The parish is not well wooded, though it seems remarkably 
well adapted for the growth of larch and spruce firs. Some 
larches, planted on the Afton fifty or sixty years ago, have attam- 
ed a noble size. There are some later plantations than these on 

the properties of the Marquis of Bute. 

II.— Civil History. 
The history of this parish possesses but little public interest. The 
writer is not aware that it has been the scene of any very remark- 
able events. It would appear that many of the inhabitants suffer- 
ed for their attachment to Presbyterian principles in the reign of 
Charles II. Three persons were put to death by the dragoons, 
who at that time scoured the country, and were buried in a moss 
at the south-west corner of the parish. A small mausoleum was 
erected on the spot, a few years ago, in place of the decayed grave- 
stone that had been laid over their bodies. The grave was open - 
ed, and part of their hair and clothed, as well as bones, found in 
a state of great preservation.

Land-oio7iers.— The chief land-owners in the parish are, the 
Marquis of Bute ; M. T. Carmichael, Esq. of Mains ; Sir Charles 
Menteath, of Cioseburn and Mansfield ; D. S. Buchanan, Esq. of 
Cunninshamhead ; Sir John Cathcart of Carleton and Water- 
head ; and Miss Stewart of Afton Lodge. 

Parochial Begisters. — The earliest entry in the parish regis- 
ters is dated 1709 ; but the register has not been regularly kept, 
till within these few years. 

Antiquities. — The few antiquities of the parish are, the site of 
the Castle of Black Craig, — on the summit of the knoll on which 
the castle village stands. The fosse of the castle is still very dis- 
tinct ; but all the stones were removed, about fifty years ago, and 
employed in the building of houses. This castle was the proper- 
ty of the Dunbars of Mochrum ; and is said to have been frequent- 
ed by the renowned Sir William Wallace. There are also the re- 
mains of an old baronial residence, near the source of the Nith, 
now the property of Sir John Cathcart. 

A large number of small coins of Edward I. of England, and 
Alexander of Scotland, enclosed in a small earthern jar, and in a 
high state of preservation, were dug up about eight years ago on 
the farm of Whitehill. They are about the value of 5d. each. 
Some of them are in the possession of George Ranken, Esq. of 
Whitehill, the owner of the lands ; the remainder, with the jar in 
which they were found, are in possession of the labourer who dug 
them up. 

A few years ago, an ancient tumulus on the farm of Polquhaise 
was removed. It was found to consist of stones, intermixed with 
fragments of human bones ; and in the centre of it, close to the 
surface of the natural soil, was a sarcophagus of large stones, con- 
taining fragments of human bones, with a small quantity of black 
earth. 

Modern Buildings. — There are two corn-mills in the parish, 
one at Dalricket, and another at Old Mill. Some time ago, a mill 
for carding wool was erected by Mr Hunter, at Mansfield village, 
where most of the home-spun wool is carded. 

In the year 1832, an elegant new church was erected volunta- 
rily by the heritors, owing to the inadequacy of the old place of 
worship, to afford accommodation, to the increased population. A 
large substantial parochial school-house was built in the course of 
last summer, capable of accommodating from 1 50 to 200 scholars.

III. — Population. 
The earliest authentic account of the population is contained in a 
Statistical Account of Ayrshire, published in 1791, from which it ap- 
pears that, in 1755, there were 1497 inhabitants, and in 1790 only 
1200. This diminution seems to be accounted for by the fact, that 
during the latter period, considerable numbers of the cottars repair- 
ed to the manufacturing districts. For it appears from Mr Ains- 
lie's tables, that during that period the population in all the ma- 
nufacturing villages of the county increased, while it proportion- 
ably diminished in the rural districts. Agriculture had not then 
made such improvement, as to counterbalance the influence of the 
manufacturers. The following table exhibits the state of the po- 
pulation in 1831.

None of the large proprietors of land reside in the parish. 
There are five resident heritors, all of them having land yielding 
a larger rental than L. 50. 

The inhabitants are, in general, of a clear ruddy complexion, of 
strong, robust, and active person ; for which the salubrity of the air, 
and their pastoral and agricultural occupations, sufficiently account. 

There is only one instance of insanity ; two fatuous, and no deaf 
and dumb person in the parish. 

IV. — Industry. 

There are no manufactures in the parish, and the people arS 
almost wholly employed in agricultural pursuits. 

Wages.— The average rate of labourers wages is 10s. per week. 

Agriculture.— The following table presents an accurate view of 
the agricultural state of the parish in 1831 :—

L. 3 to L. 4 ; for a ewe or full-grown sheep, 3s. 6d. 

Produce. — The annual average amount of raw produce, as near- 
ly as can be ascertained, is exhibited in the following table : — 

Oats, barley, and wheat, - L. 11660 0 0

A large amount of waste land has been reclaimed, within the 
last fifteen or twenty years. During the same period, the system 
of draining has been extensively adopted, and has contributed much 
both to the fertility of the land and salubrity of the climate. The 
system of irrigation has been acted upon on a large scale by Sir 
Charles Menteath, of Closeburn and Mansfield ; and the success 
attending this mode of improvement has been fully attested by the 
splendid crops raised on his lands along the banks of the Nith. 

By paring and burning the surface during the summer of the 
first year, ploughing the land in the autumn, laying lime upon the 
land so ploughed to the amount of 200 imperial bushels in the 
next spring, and sowing out the land with grass seeds, Yorkshire 
fog, at the rate of five bushels to the Scotch acre, in the month of 
July, this mode of improvement of dry. moor-land with a sandy 
subsoil has been successfully practised upon the estate of Close- 
burn, in Dumfries-shire, and no heather appears after the lapse of 
twenty years. Though this mode has been employed upon dry moors 
with an open subsoil by Sir C. G. S. Menteath, he does not recom- 
mend the practice for the cold subsoiled moors of Ayrshire, as 
rushes are sure to follow the ploughing of these moors, which 
renders it necessary again to plough them, after being laid down 
to grass, for three or four years, in order to kill the rushes. Lime 
to the amount of 400 bushels per acre upon the surface, with open 
sheep drains, to remain in pasture, will be found a more profitable 
improvement. 

W. Hyslop, Esq. of Bank and Blackcraig, also deserves ho- 
nourable notice as a spirited enterprising agriculturist. In Octo- 
ber last, he received the premium for the best managed farm in 
the district of Kyle. 

Leases. — The leases vary from fifteen to nineteen years, and 
bind the farmers to the most improved method of husbandry. They 



520 



AYRSHIRE. 



require, among other conditions, a regular rotation of different 
kinds of crops, so far as the soil will admit of it. 

Live-Stock. — The following table exhibits the amount of stock : 

Sheep, - 20030 

Young cows, - 1744 
Horses, - 372 -■ 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market-Town. — There is no market-town in the parish. The 
nearest is Old Cumnock, at the distance of five miles. 

Villages. — In the parish, there are three villages, of which the 
population in 1831 was as follows : — 

New Cuinnock, - 161 

Afton Bridgend, - 242 

Pathhead, - - 361 

Total village population, 764 

There is one turnpike road in the parish, and several parish 
roads in good repair. On the public road, there passes daily a 
coach from Glasgow to Carlisle, and from Carlisle to Glasgow. 

The roads in the parish of New Cumnock were not well attend- 
ed to, more particularly on the east side of the Nith, till the estate 
of Mansfield was purchased by Sir G. Stuart Menteath, when, in 
order that coal and lime should find a market in the county of 
Dumfries, a rail-road of inch bar-iron, of nearly three miles in 
length, was laid down to the boundary of the counties of Dumfries 
and Ayr. The coal was carried in rail-road waggons, each contain- 
ing one ton, and one horse draws four waggons. Upon arriving at 
the summit level of the counties, these waggons are emptied into 
large waggons of the common construction of road waggons, and the 
remainder of the road is a continual descent of nearly four miles, 
except in crossing three ravines, which occasioned inclined planes 
of one foot of rise in thirty feet. The difficulty of ascending these 
inchned planes, is surmounted by laying down stone tracks for the 
wheels ; upon which sheet iron, six inches wide, and a quarter of 
an inch thick, is nailed down, which enables a horse to draw three 
tons of coal up these ascents— a plan which Sir C. S. Menteath 
has frequently recommended upon the roads throughout Great Bri- 
tain about twenty-five years ago, and now in progress of adoption 
on the Holyhead road to London, by order of Sir Henry Parnell. 
The rail-road for ordinary roads should be laid down with cast 
iron, similar to the wheel-tract for carts in Glasgow ; upon which 
one horse can draw three tons upon an ascent of one foot m every 
fifteen feet. It may be said this cannot be done for a long ascent ; 



NEW CUMNOCK. 



521 



but this is never necessary, as a short distance might be made level 
occasionally in every long ascent. Unless Sir C. S. Menteath had 
adopted the friction brake in common use for heavy carriages in 
Belgium, no horse could take down three ton weight with the drag 
in common use. This brake is applied to the two hind wheels of 
a waggon by means of a screw, which presses a plank of wood 
against the wheels of the waggon, and enables the carter to apply 
as much friction as is necessary to retard the wheels without stop- 
ping or dragging them. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated between the 
villages of New Cumnock and Afton Bridgend, and, though not 
precisely in the centre of the parish, occupies a very eligible situa- 
tion for the great bulk of the population. It was built about five 
years ago, is in perfect repair, and is capable of accommodating 
with ease 1000 sitters. The free sittings are about 100. The 
precise date of the erection of the manse; I have not been able to 
ascertain ; an addition to it was built, about forty yeai's ago. It 
is in an indifferent state of repair. The glebe consists of eleven 
acres, and may be worth annually from L. 20 to L. 30. The sti- 
pend is L. 1 77, paid in money. 

There is a small meeting-house in the parish, in connection with 
the Reformed Presbyterians. They have no minister, and I be- 
lieve have never had one ; but are occasionally supplied with ser- 
mon by preachers of that denomination, or by neighbouring mi- 
nisters. 

The following table shews the relative numbers of dissenters 
and churchmen in 1831: — Individuals belonging to Established 
Church, 1752 ; Seceders of various denominations, 299 ; Re- 
formed Presbyterians, 117. The average number of communi- 
cants in the parish church, may be stated at 600. The number on 
the communicants' roll is considerably larger. The people, con- 
sidering the wide surface over which they are scattered, and the 
consequent distance of many of them from the church, are very 
regular in their attendance on religious ordinances. 

Education. — There are, at present, five schools in the parish, 
besides the parish school. Some of these, however, are attended 
by a very small number of scholars, and their continuance is very 
precarious. The following table exhibits the various branches 
taught in the parochial school, the rate of wages, and their annual 
amount : English reading per quarter, 2s. 6d. ; writing additional, 
3s. ; arithmetic do. 3s. 6d. : English grammar, do. 4s. ; geography

and book-keeping, 5s. ; Latin and mensuration, each 5s. ; school- 
master's salary, the maximum, L. 33; average number of scholars 
at parish school, 100. Fees actually paid to the teacher may be 
from L. 40 to L. 50 annually. 

The private schools may be attended by about 100. There 
are several Sabbath schools, having about 200 scholars from seven 
to fourteen years of age. 

Library. — There is one circulating library, which was instituted 
about nine years ago, and consists of upwards of 700 volumes of 
useful knowledge. There is, also, a small library of about 300 vo- 
lumes, entirely religious, for the benefit of a catechumen's class, 
taught by the minister on the Sabbath evenings. 

Poor. — The average number of persons receiving parochial 
aid, during the last two years, was 12. Two received per month 
5s.; four, 4s. ; three, 6s.; one, 16s.; one, 8s. 6d. ; one, 3s. 

The whole of the above expenditure is defrayed by the collec- 
tions at the church doors, which amount on an average to L. 36 
annually, by the receipts from mortcloths, and by the interest 
of L. 100 at 5 per cent., bequeathed to the poor by a native of 
the parish. The poor of the parish in general manifest a laud- 
able anxiety to make every effort for their own maintenance. It 
is seldom that any application is made for rehef from the poor's 
funds, except in cases of real destitution. 

Fairs. — There is a fair held annually in the parish, on the Thurs- 
day preceding Whitsunday ; at which a considerable number of 
cattle are exposed to sale. 

Ale-houses.— There are 14 ale-houses at present in the parish.

L — Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, Boundaries. — The parish of Dreghorn, in Cun- 
ninghame, extends in a narrow stripe from the Water of Irvine 
on the south, where it joins Dundonald, to the parish of Fenwick, 
on the north-east ; and is bounded on the east by the Gawreer 
Burn, which divides it from Kilmaurs, and by the Annock Water 
on the west, that separates it from the parishes of Irvine and 
Stewarton. Its extent is nearly 8 miles from south-west to north- 
east, and from three-quarters of a mile to two miles in breadth. Its 
surface amounts to 4477 acres, of which, by a calculation made in 
1820, there were in tillage, 1490 acres; cultivated grass land, 2774 
acres; woods and gardens, 122 acres; and roads, 61 acres. 

This parish, which is a dead flat towards the sea, from which it 
is only two miles distant, and not much in that quarter above its 
level, rises in gently undulating hills towards the east and north- 
east ; and is throughout of very considerable beauty, particularly 
the section of it that runs along the Annock Water. It is well en- 
closed and planted. The soil in the south-eastern district of it is 
a deep rich loam, yielding remarkably good crops. Towards the 
north-east, it is nearly of the same character, and also productive. 
To the south-west, the land varies in nature and quality, running 
in patches from loam to gravel. The coal formation is exhibited 
here as in the neighbouring parishes ; but there is nothing remark- 
able in Dreghorn in a geological point of view. 

II. — Civil History. 
The whole of the parish was formerly the property of the De 
Morvilles, who were constables of Scotland and Lords of Cunning- 
hame, the first of whom seems to- have settled in this country as 
early as the time of Alexander I., and to have had very extensive 
possessions in it. The property of this family passed by the heiress 
of William de Morville to Ronald, Lord of Galloway, whose son

Alan, Constable of Scotland, and Lord of Galloway and Cun- 
ninghame, had a daughter, Helen, who, about the year 1233, mar- 
ried Roger de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, who, in her right, be- 
came Constable of Scotland, and proprietor of the De Morville 
estates. He died in 1 264, leaving by this marriage three daughters, 
one of whom, Margaret, was married to William de Ferrars, and 
another Ela, to Alan de la Zuche, who received by them very ex- 
tensive and valuable possessions in Cunninghame, of which the 
lands of the parish of Dreghorn formed a part, and which they 
held pro indiviso. The present Marquis of Townshend is the 
lineal descendant of William de Ferrars, and Alan de la Zuche 
was the ancestor of the Lords Ashby of Ashby de la Zuche, in 
Leicestershire. The property of William de Ferrars and Alan de 
la Zuche was forfeited by Robert the Bruce, in consequence of their 
adherence to the party of John Baliol, their kinsman. The barony 
of Dreghorn was conferred by him on one of the Bonkill family. 
Sir Alan Stewart, who fell at the battle of Hallidown Hill in 1333, 
in the hands of whose descendants, who were afterwards Earls of 
Darnley and Lennox, it continued till 1520, when it became the 
property of Hugh, first Earl of Eglinton, in whose family it still 
continues. 

The barony of Peirceton became the property of Sir James 
Stewart, brother of Alan, and ancestor of the Stewarts of Lorn, 
Innermeath, Athole, and Grantully. His son having died without 
male issue, the estate of Peirceton passed by his daughter into the 
hands of Sir William Douglas, whose youngest daughter married, 
in 1390, Robert Barclay, member of a family of great power and 
influence at that time, in the west of Scotland, who became in her 
right Baron of Peirceton and Warrick-hill. This family, now re- 
presented by Sir Robert Barclay of Ivy Cottage Middlesex, lived 
at Peirceton in considerable splendour for 300 years. They ahe- 
nated the property in 1720, to Mr M'Credie, whose great-grand- 
daughter, married to Mr P. B. Mure, Advocate, now possesses it. 

The manner in which the other lands in the parish passed down 
. to the present proprietors is not so easily traced.

mansion-houses built on the banks of the Annock Water, and 
pleasantly situated. Of these the most delightful residence is that 
of Annock Lodge, belonging to Mrs Montgomerie, widow of Wil- 
liam Montgomerie, Esq. brother of the late Earl of Eglinton. It 
is truly Arcadian in its character. The house is built on the south 
side of the Annock, is shut in behind by a high wooded bank, and 
overlooks a plain of the richest verdure, stretching out in front as far 
as the eye can reach, and flanked on both sides with gently rismg 
lulls partially covered with wood. The other residences in the pa- 
rish are Peirceton, belonging to Mr Mure M'Credie; Righouse, a 
ferme ornee, the property of Colonel Fullarton of Fullarton ; 
Cunninghamhead, possessed by Mr Snodgrass Buchanan ; and 
. Warrickhill by Mr M'Dougal Ralston. 

III. — Population. 
The population of the parish, according to the census 1831, 
amounted to 888 persons, of whom 419 were males and 469 fe- 
males. All these persons were engaged in agricultural pursuits, 
with the exception of two individuals employed as manufacturers, 
34 as retail traders and handicraftsmen, and 8 proprietors and pro- 
fessional men. It has since been nearly stationary. ' 

Number of illegitimate births during the last three years, 9. 
Character and Habits of the People.— The people of this parish 
seem to be of sober and industrious habits. They possess to a limit- 
ed extent the means of improvement, as the inhabitants of all coun- 
try parishes must do ; since they enjoy none of the advantages of 
hterary societies, libraries, reading-rooms, and close and frequent 
intercourse with each other, which are so easily obtained in towns. 
They, however, possess the superior advantages of religious habits 
and uncontaminated morals, which are so easily destroyed where 
there is a purely urban population. It has been remarked, that a 
clannish feeling still exists in this parish, which unites the people in 
strong bonds of attachment to each other. 

IV. — Industry. 
It is estimated that two thirds of the soil of this parish consist 
of a deep loam, resting upon a retentive subsoil. The land of 
this character was originally cold and wet, but has of late years 

• In reference to what is here stated, the following anecdote is told : A good wo- 
man of Dreghorn, who had lost her husband, not seeming very disconsolate in her 
state of bereavement, was remonstrated with by her neighbour on her apparent hard- 
ness of heart, and want of sensibliity. She pleaded guilty to the charge, but excused 
herself by saying, " Its true, Janet, am no so muckle o'ercome as I ought to be ; but 
you see John, puir man, was no o' our parish,"

been ameliorated by draining, wbich has been much resorted to 
by the farmer, who employs for this purpose tiles made at tile- 
works in the parish. 

Agriculture. — The rotation of crops upon this species of land, 
is based on the old system of husbandry : 1st and 2d year, oats ; 
3d ryegrass, followed by five years pasture. Where this system 
is pursued, the farmers have large dairies, and make the kind of 
cheese generally known by the name of Dunlop cheese. 

Husbandry. — The portion of the land in the parish that is con- 
tiguous to the sea is a free light soil resting upon an open gravelly 
subsoil. The general rotation of crops in this part, is a six-course 
shift, 1st year, oats ; 2d, potatoes or turnips ; 3d, wheat or barley ; 
4th, clover and ryegrass ; 6th and 6th, pasture. The turnips raised 
on the farms here are used for fattening cattle and sheep. The far- 
mers have large dairies. Butter is made by them, and milk dis- 
posed of in the neighbouring town of Irvine. The farms vary in 
extent from 100 to 200 acres, and are laid out in fields enclosed 
with beech and thorn-hedges. The fields differ in size from 10 
to 20 acres. The farm-houses are remarkably good in the south 
part of the parish ; some of them of two stories, and extremely 
comfortable and commodious. The spirit of agricultural improve- 
ment, which is so manifest throughout Scotland, has extended to 
this parish. 

Re7it of Land. — The land is in value from L. 1, 10s. to L. 3 
per acre, and is held on leases of nineteen years. 

Live Stoch.—The cows on the farms are of the Ayrshire breed. 
The sheep black-faced and Cheviots, with a few Southdowns. 

Mines.— Coa\\s supposed to be abundant in this district towards 
the sea, but has not been extensively wrought. Twelve thousand 
tons were formerly put out yearly, from mines which were shut up 
from want of capital in the lessee. A new pit has just been open- 
ed under better auspices, and promises well. Freestone of excel- 
lent quality is found, and lime is quarried at the north-east extre- 
mity of the parish. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
Villac/e.— The village of Dreghorn, which lies on the road 
from Kilmarnock to Irvine, and two miles distant from the last 
mentioned town, is pleasantly situate on the first gentle acclivity 
towards the sea, and the climate is very salubrious, the prevailing 
winds being from the west and south-west, and no marshes or 
source of miasmata in the neighbourhood. The houses are old, 

4 



DllEGHORN.

and run in irregular lines along the highway, and being interspersed 
with old trees, and neatly kept and white-washed, have a very rural 
appearance. The village contains 277 inhabitants, — the male part 
of whom, with the exception of a few mechanics who find employ- 
ment among the neighbouring farmers, are occupied in agricultu- 
ral labour. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Before the Reformation, this parish eccle- 
siastically belonged to the Tyronenses monks at Kilwinning, and 
was united in 1688 to that of Peirceton, regarding which union 
nothing is known with certainty, — the portion of the parish record 
which might throw light upon it having been accidentally or surrep- 
titiously removed. The present church, built about fifty years ago, 
which is situate in the village at the south extremity of the parish, 
is a very simple and rather beautiful building, of an octagonal 
form, and can accommodate about 427 persons. The average at- 
tendance at church is in summer 200, and in winter 130 persons. 
The inhabitants who reside in the immediate vicinity appear pretty 
regularly there, and the distant population frequent the churches 
which lie more contiguous, and are more accessible to them. 

The number of families in the parish attending the Established 
Church is 110 : of families attending the chapels of Dissenters and 
Seceders, 31. 

The manse is a very good house, built about the same time as 
the church. The income of the clergyman is 16 chalders of 
grain. He possesses a glebe of remarkably good land, in extent 
about 4 acres. 

Education. — The parochial school in the village is attended by 
100 children, who are carefully instructed in the usual branches 
of education, at the rate of from 3s. to 5s. per quarter. The sa- 
lary of the schoolmaster is L. 30, and the whole emoluments of 
his situation amount to L. 100 per annum. 

A school partially endowed is also kept in the centre of the pa- 
rish, and is attended by 40 children. 

Poor. — There are few paupers in this parish. Their number is 
on an average 15, and their monthly allowance from the heritors 
and kirk-session, 4s. The amount of parish collections for the poor 
is on an average L. 22, lis. : of legal assessments, L. 42, 10s. 

Ale-homes. — There are 5 ale-houses in the parish ; their effect 
on the morals of the inhabitants does not appear to be more detri- 
mental than in other places.

PRESBYTERY OF STRANRAER, SYNOD OF GALLOWAY. 

THE REV. THOMAS BLAIR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
]:sJame — Boundaries. — It cannot be ascertained how this parish 
received its present name. Some derive it from Si Columba, 
others from the Latin word Columba, a pigeon, because the woods 
abound with wood-pigeons. Craigneil, a place nearly opposite 
the village, signifies in Gaelic the lime-rock, and from this it has 
been conjectured by some that Colmonell or Colmoneil may have 
reference to the natural appearance of the district — the parish 
abounding in limestone. Its greatest length is about 19 miles, 
and its greatest breadth 7. The superficial contents may be esti- 
mated at 56,800 acres. It is bounded on the west, by the parish 
of Ballantrae ; on the east, by Girvan and Bar ; on the south, by 
Minnigaff, Penningham, and Kirkcowan ; and on the north, by 
the Frith of Clyde. 

Topographical Appearances.— The holms on the banks of the 
Stinchar, Dhuisk, and Lendal are of a rich alluvial soil, and bear 
excellent crops of wheat, barley, oats, &amp;c. The declivities on the 
banks of these streams are beautifully clothed with a mixture of 
oak, ask, elm, larch, alder, and birch ; and in many places are suffi- 
ciently gentle to admit of cultivation. The higher grounds in some 
places are of a cold stifF clayey nature, with gravelly bottom, but 
for the most part moorland, and where the attempt has been made, 
they are brought with great difficulty into cultivation. They are 
fitter for sheep-farming than pasture. The hills which frame the 
valleys are of no great elevation. Their greatest height is about 
700 feet above the level of the sea ; and on each side of the Stm- 
char, they are generally composed of mountain limestone. 

Hydroc/raphij.—Slmchav is the most considerable and beautiful 
river in the parish. It has its source in the parish of Bar, and 
on entering this, winds its clear waters in a westerly dn-ection 
through it for nearly nine miles. In its course, it is joined by tlie 



COLMONELL. 



529 



Dhuisk, or Black-water, another large stream, and crossed by 
three stone and the same number of . wooden bridges. The old- 
est stone bridge, and at that time the only one between this dis- 
trict and Galloway, was built in 1731. It fell at first, and the 
contractors were assisted in the second erection by collections 
made in the parish churches throughout Ayrshire and Galloway. 
There are also several fresh water lochs in the parish. The larg- 
est, and most beautiful and romantic, are Loch Dornal and Loch 
Mabeiry. The latter discharges itself by the river Bladenoch in- 
to the sea at Wigton. 

II. — Civil History. 

Heritors. — There are twenty land-owners. The property of 
the Duchess de Coigny is of the highest valuation. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of births commences in 1759, 
and there are no sessional records of older date than 1786. 

Antiquities. — There are still remaining the ruins of Knockdaw, 
Carleton, Craigneil, Kirkhill, Penwherry, and Knockdolian Cas- 
tles. Craigneil in particular is a fine ruin. It is said to have been 
built in the thirteenth century, and to have been one of the hiding- 
places of King Robert the Bruce, during his wanderings in Ayrshire 
and Galloway. Elevated on a rock of mountain limestone, it com- 
mands a view of the whole valley of Stinchar from Penmore to 
Knockdolian. It belongs to the Most Noble the Marquis of Ailsa, 
and in feudal times was a prison and place of execution. Not 
less interesting are the graves of three martyrs who, in the times 
of persecution, resisted unto blood. The following inscription 
on the head-stone of one of them, and recorded in the Cloud of 
Witnesses, may have suggested the name of Mucklewrath, the 
raving enthusiast in old Mortality. 

" I, Mathevv M'lli aith, in parish of Colnionell, 

By bloody Claverhouse I fell, 

Who did command that I should die, 

For owning Covenanted presbytry. 

My blood a witness still doth stand 

Gainst all defections in this land." 

Modern Buildings. — The mansion houses of Penmore, Dalger- 
rock and Knockdolian, though built more than a hundred years 
ago, are still inhabited.— Ballochmorie, the seat of W. Macadam, 
Esq. grandson of the celebrated road -improver, was built in 1833. 
The grounds surrounding it are laid out with great taste, and when 
the plantations shall have grown up, the mansion itself will be 
as comfortable as it is elegant. R. Waron, Esq. of Mayfield, a 
spirited proprietor, is just now erecting a spacious dwellinff on

his property at Drumlamford. This building when completed will 
greatly enliven that hitherto dreary and desolate tract of country.

There have been 12 illegitimate births during-the last three years. 
The number is on the decline ; and there has been a considera- 
ble improvement of morals in this respect. Instances of this kind 
have of late years been generally followed by marriage. 

The greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture. 
The rest are fishers, day-labourers, and country artisans.

Husbandry.— 'It is difficult to estimate the amount and value 
of the raw produce of the parish, from the unwillingness of some 
to give the necessary information. As far as it could be ascertained, 
it is as follows : 

Oats, 6000 bolls at 17s. per boll, L. 5100 

Wheat, 2000 do. 24s. do. 2400 

Barley, 700 do. 20s. do. 700 

Potatoes, 9000 do. 8s. do. 3600 

Turnips, 200 acres at L. 8 per acre, 2400 

Rye-grass, 400 do 200 stones do. 2000 

L. 16200 

Agriculture is as well understood, and practised with as much 
success here, as in the other districts of the country. The lower 
lands on Dhuisk, Lendal, and Stinchar are in general well enclosed 
and subdivided. The usual rotation adopted is a five-shift, consist- 
ing of green crop, barley or wheat, sown down with grass, the grass 
cut the first, and pastured the second year, and oats. The abundance 
of sea weed, and lime, and of late, the introduction of bone manure, 
have contributed greatly to the improvement of the soil ; and the 
towns of Girvan, Ayr, Kilmarnock, Glasgow, and Liverpool, af- 
ford a ready and excellent market for every article of produce.

Of late years, the produce of the dairy has been an object of 
considerable importance. The Cunningham breed of cattle have 
in consequence greatly increased, and much attention has been 
paid to their improvement. The average quantity of cheese made 
in the parish may be about 3600 stones per annum, which at last 
year's price of 8s. per stone, amounts to L. 1400. On the higher 
lands, the care of black-faced sheep and Galloways is still the 
principal object of the farmer. About 200 stones white, and 1000 
laid wool are disposed of annually. Last year, the white sold at 15s. 
and the laid at 9s. per stone. The farmers, for the most part, rear 
the Galloways, and after feeding them for two or three years, sell 
them to cattle-dealers from the south. 

Fisheries.— The coast abounds in fish of various kinds, such as 
cod, whitings, haddock, turbot, skate, herrings. The fishing of 
lobsters has of late become a lucrative employment to many fami- 
lies. They carry them or forward them by steam-boats to Dub- 
lin, where they find a ready market, and sometimes sell them so 
high as two guineas a dozen. The Stinchar also abounds with 
salmon at certain seasons of the year. There are eight or nine 
salmon-pools, the rental of which may be L. 30 per annum. 

Rate of Wages.— Females get from L. 5 to L. 6, and men from 
L. 12 to L. 14 per annum. Day-labourers, without victuals, have 
Is. 4d. and Is. 6d. per day; women, 9d. ; masons and carpenters, 
2s. and 2s. 6d. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Villaffes.— The village of Colmonell, merely a row of thatched 
houses a few years ago, has been almost rebuilt. The houses now, 
with a few exceptions, are slated, clean-looking, and harmonize well 
• withthesurroundingscenery. It has a post-oiiice, and, since the pas- 
singof the Reform Bill, it has been appointed one of the polling sta- 
tions of the county. Four fairs are held annually in it, on the first 
Mondays O. S. of February, May, August, and November It 
contains 300 inhabitants. Barhill, on Dhuisk, has lately sprung in- 
to existence. It is the only resting-place for the traveller between 
Newton-Stewart and Girvan. Three cattle-markets are held there 
every year, on the fourth Fridays of April, September, and Oc- 
tober. 

Iioads.-Theve are two roads between Girvan and Ballantrae. 
One, the great road to Ireland, sweeps along the coast, having on 
one side the rocky shore and majestic ocean, and on the other the 
verdant hills of Carleton and Bennan. The Irish mail passes this 



532 



AYUSllIKE. 



way. The second, inland, keeps along the banks of the Stinchar, 
where its windings amid the most picturesque scenery, and the 
beautiful hill of Knockdolian, present a variety of enchanting pic- 
tures to the eye. A third, traversed by the mail from the south, 
has opened up the whole of that wild district which lies between 
Barhill and Newton- Stewart, and contributed greatly to its im- 
provement. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The present church was built in 1772, 
and seated anew in 1832. It contains 500 sittings, and is very 
inconveniently placed at one extremity of the parish. Several 
famiUes are sixteen miles distant from it. It cannot nearly ac- 
commodate the people. There are 30 free sittings in it, and 460 
communicants ; 350 families belong to the Establishment. 

There is also a chapel in which the parish minister officiates 
every fourth Sabbath during ten months of the year. It is eight 
miles distant from the parish church. Religious instruction has 
been gratuitously afforded the inhabitants there, more than eighty 
years. The Dissenters in the parish, about thirty years ago, as- 
sisted in repairing the chapel, and since that time have had the 
use of it in the absence of the parish minister. An addition was 
built to it in 1833; it now accommodates 300 sitters. 

The manse was built in 1822, and the offices thirty years ago. 
There are 7 acres of glebe, 5 arable and 2 meadow, valued at 
L. 15 per annum. The stipend is 16 chalders of victual, half 
meal, half barley, and L. 10 for communion elements. 

Dissenters.— Theve are two Dissenting congregations in the 
parish,— one of Reformed Pesbyterians, and another of Origmal 
Seceders. A few belong to the United Secession church, and 
we have about forty Roman Catholics. But four-fifths of the 
whole population are members of the Establishment. 

ScAoo/s.— There are six schools, the parochial, and five supported 
by voluntary contribution or school fees. The parochial schoolmas- 
ter has the maximum salary and legal accommodation. The school 
fees amount to L. 20 per annum. He also receives a half year s 
rent of L. 21, 15s. from the farm of Little Dangart, for teaching 
six poor boys to read English. The other half year's rent goes 
to the maintenance and better clothing of the boys. This morti- 
fication was left about seventy years ago by Dr Kennedy, a native 
of the parish. Two of the private schools are taught summer and 
winter, and the master of one of them, in addition to the wages, 
gets bed, board, and washing, and resides with the parents of the 



COLMONELL. 



533 



children in turn. Dr Hamilton of Kildonan, and the Trustees of 
the late Sir W. Fettes, have given L. 15 per annum to the other; 
and, as many poor children receive their education gratis on this ac- 
count, it is hoped they will continue the contribution. The other 
three private schools are on the teachers' own adventure. The 
number of scholars attending the six schools averages during sum- 
mer 110, during winter 250 ; and the expense of education is\s fol- 
lows :— reading per quarter, 3s.; reading, writing, arithmetic, 
do. 4s. 6d. ; Latin and Greek, 6s. 

The people generally can read and write, and are by no means 
averse to the education of their children. On the contrary, all 
seem anxious to have them taught to read the Bible, and give 
them the blessings of sacred and useful knowledge. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— Tv/enty-fom persons receive pa- 
rochial aid. The funds for their support and expenses of manage- 
ment are derived from the following sources. Mortcloth per 
annum, L. .3; donations from heritors do. L, 20 ; fines do. L. 1; 
collections at church door do. L. 30 ; proclamations, L. 5. 

Inns.—There are two inns, and seven public-houses ; yet intem- 
perance is not the besetting sin of the people. This disproportion 
may be ascribed in a great measure to the number of fairs held 
annually in the parish, and the public roads that intersect it. 

Fuel.~Mauy attempts have been made to discover coal, but 
without effect. Coals are generally used in the lower, and peats 
in the higher districts. The coals brought from Bargany and Dul- 
quharran cost the villagers 10s. a cart. The cart contains 12 cwt. 
Peats are sold at 3s. a cart. 

Lime-kilns.~Fi\e are kept going during the summer months, 
and afford employment to many labourers. They burn about 
20,000 bolls of lime per annum. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The population has been nearly doubled within the last thirty 
years. This rapid increase is mainly attributable to the excellent 
roads that divide the parish in every direction. The estate of 
Kildonan that, about twenty-five years ago, was almost wholly 
covered with heath, is now thickly inhabited, and the soil has been 
rendered fit to bear the most luxurious crops. Many small farmers 
are located on it, who rent from forty to fifty acres. Great attention 
has been paid to the sheep-stock. On the more sheltered farms 
It has been much improved by a cross with the Leicester and 
Cheviot-ram, thus producing a larger animal, and shorter and fi'i

wool. Care in the selection of stock, and a more skilful method 
of management, have been displayed. Among other things which 
distinguish the present from the past, the pheasant is occasionally 
seen in the woods that skirt the Stinchar. Numerous covies of 
black game are also met with on the moor-edges, while grouse, the 
favourite of the sportsman, is rapidly disappearing. 

The newly built farm-houses are of a much better description 
than those of earlier date. They are almost all slated, and not 
a few have an inclosure in front, ornamented with rose-bushes 
and other shrubs and flowers. The farmer himself has shared in 
the general improvement. The epithet " slovenly" is less ap- 
plicable to him, and at " kirk and market" the outer man, at 
least, shows a decided improvement. The voice of praise, indeed, 
is not so often heard in their dwellings, and family-worship is 
greatly neglected ; but still the church is well attended, and the 
people are moral and industrious. Intemperance appears to be 
on the decline. The long and deep carousings, so common some 
years ago, at buying and selling, are seldom heard of. A 
greater degree of decency is observed at funerals, and the service 
which, in some instances in olden times, amounted to fourteen 
rounds of spirits and wine, has been reduced to three. Religious 
animosities have ceased. On the whole, were it not for the heart- 
burnings, and levelling spirit produced by the political discus- 
sions of the day, the inhabitants of this parish would be contented 
and happy.

REV. ANDREW HAMILTON, High Church,  



I. — Topography and Natural History.  

Name. — The name Kilmarnock evidently means the cell of 
Marnock, who is said to have been a bishop or confessor in Scot- 
Jand in the beginning of the fourth century ; and whose fame as a 
saint must have been widely extended, as Kilmaronock in Dumbar- 
tonshire, Inch Marnock in Loch Lomond, and Inch Marnock ad- 
jacent to Bute, bear record. 

Extent, §-. — The parish is about 9 miles in extreme length, and 
4 in breadth ; and the number of superficial acres is 8340. It is 
bounded on the east, by Loudoun ; on the north and west, by Fen- 
wick and Kilmaurs ; and on the south, by the river Irvine, which 
separates the presbyteries of Ayr and Irvine, and divides the dis- 
trict of Cunningham from that of Kyle. 

The country has a gentle slope towards the river, which flows 
from east to west ; and as the traveller approaches, especially from 
the south, while his eye sweeps from Loudoun hill to the peaks of 
Arran, he sees the town beneath him in the midst of a rich and 
finely cultivated valley. 

Meteorology. — The climate of this parish is mild, and the mean 
temperature of the low-lying portions of it, on which the town is 
built, appears to be higher than that of the adjoining parishes, 
which lie more inland. The state of the atmosphere as to heat 
and moisture varies much, and frequently; and from our proxi- 
mity to the Western Ocean, and the great prevalence of south 
and west winds, our wet and cloudy days considerably outnumber 
those of drought and sunshine. The air is thus loaded with aque-

oLis vapours, and might be expected to inftuence accordingly tlie 
health of the population. . 

Distempers. — It does not appear, however, that any disease has 
become located here as an endemic; neither can it be said that 
the inhabitants are more liable to be attacked by epidemics ; nor, 
when they are attacked, do these prove more "fatal than in other 
districts. In the case of cholera, with which the town was visited 
in common with many others in 1832, the proportion of deaths to 
the amount of population proved nearly the same as in towns of 
equal magnitude in other parts of Britain, and on the continent ; 
and so also may it be stated of other epidemics when such have oc- 
curred. There is every reason to believe, that the average mor- 
tality is not greater than in the same amount of population in 
other manufacturing districts : and that the health of the parish 
is as good as can be looked for amidst a population of so mixed a 
character. 

Geology. — Our information regarding the geology and mine- 
ralogy of the parish is very vague. The minerals are but few, 
being principally confined to the carboniferous or coal system ; but 
their value renders this an important mineralogical district, for, 
valuable as its surface produce is, the subterranean treasures are 
equally great. We need not expatiate on the acknowledged im- 
portance of coal in spreading manufactures and increasing nation- 
al wealth. The town, which is situated in the south-west end 
of the parish, is the point towards which all the strata dip ; from it 
they rise at an angle of about 6 or 7 degrees, and only two dikes of 
any consequence have been discovered ; one at the very south-west 
point, of greenstone, about 30 yards broad ; the other, which is 
much larger, is visible in the Kilmarnock water to the east of the 
town, and forms an excellent dam dike to the extensive woollen 
manufactories of Messrs Blackwood. Proceeding up Polbeath 
burn, the eastern boundary of the parish, several beds of excellent 
limestone are met with, which have been wrought to considerable 
advantage for many years, in the neighbouring parish. A little 
farther up, several veins of ironstone are seen ; these run eastward, 
and are met with in the estate of Grougar in great abundance and 
variety ; so much so, that, on this estate, iron-works on an extensive 
scale are expected to be soon begun. A mass of greenstone forms 
the bed of the burn for nearly half a-mile ; over which it falls, at 
a spot where, the banks are nearly 100 feet high, about 60 
feet in six or seven sweeps, separate from each other about ten 



KILMARNOCK.

yards. In several places, a bed of beautiful white freestone, about 
ten feet thick, is visible. Where the freestone rests on trap, it is 
full of mica, and very much calcined. Several attempts have late- 
ly been made in that quarter to obtain coal. Throughout the 
south-west, the coal-metals alone prevail. Proceeding up Kil- 
marnock water, sandstone of various qualities is met with, and near 
the Dean Castle, a fine bed of excellent white freestone, 40 feet 
thick, has long been wrought ; it is sold at lOd. per cart-load, and 
affords a plentiful supply of stone for all kinds of buildings in the 
town. 

A considerable quantity of fire-bricks is manufactured at the 
same place ; they sell at L. 4 per thousand. A little farther up, we 
find greenstone similar to that found at Polbeath burn ; it is dis- 
tinctly visible for nearly half a-mile, and in one place forms a beau- 
tiful little waterfall. Along the north-west, the coal metals alone 
are found ; in these, balls of ironstone are frequently got, and beds 
of it are often met with below them. 

 Few fossil remains have been observed. Ferns are frequently met 
with in the shales, and reeds in the freestone. Several specimens 
of the Lepidodendron have been got in the freestone of the coal for - 
raation, clearly showing that this was once a much warmer climate. 
Zoophytes have been found in mountain limestone, belono-ino- to 
the tribes Encrinites, and Pentacrinites. Several species of bivalve 
shells have also been met with. 

No ores, we believe, have been discovered. 

The following appears to be a correct statement regardina the 
sod. « In general, it is a strong rich soil, consisting of clay,°with 
a mixture of sand ; and near the moors, some moss. There are some 
fine holms along the banks of the Irvine, consisting of sand and fine 
loam brought down by the river, and left on its banks after floods." 
Along the west and south, the soil is lighter than northward; 
there it comes more closely in contact with the till, and of course 
stiffens. The banks of the Irvine have been raised so as to pfe- 
vent those inundations of the neighbouring holms, which used to 
be experienced annually. The system of tile-draining, which has 
been very extensively introduced, has had the most beneficial effects 
on the clayey soil. It is always kept dry and ready for the opera- 
tions of the husbandman, and the' face of the country has in con- 
sequence assumed a far more rich and beautiful appearance. Coal 
mmes are the only sort wrought in the parish. They are situated 
ui the estate of Plis Grace the Duke of Portland, and vvrouoht by

him. The seams, which are of the finest quahty, vary in thickness 
from 2 to 5 feet ; and strata of both fire and blind coal have been 
wrought to considerable advantage for nearly a century. From 
the depth at which the respective seams are placed, varying from 
20 to 60 fathoms, shafts are invariably sunk. The vast quantity 
of cla} found above the coal metals keeps them in general dry. 
Nearly 90,000 tons are raised annually, of which about 25,000 
are used in the parish, and between 60,000 and 70,000 export- 
ed. The average price per ton when laid down in the town is 7s. 
From the judicious management under which the pits are placed, 
very few accidents occur. Almost no choke-damp is met with. 
About 300 men are connected with the works, and it is but just to 
say, that they are a sober, well behaved, industrious people, seldom 
removing from the locality. 

Zoology.— T\\Q superiority of the Ayrshire cow is generally ad- 
mitted,' and it appears to maintain its high character among agri- 
culturists of all countries. Not only is it esteemed amongst the 
dairy districts of Scotland, but it is eagerly sought for to improve 
English and foreign stock. Of late, great numbers have been pur- 
chased for exportation to Prussia and Australia, and a high price 
has been obtained. In milking, the Ayrshire breed is superior, 
and the quality of the milk very rich. When full-grown, the cow 
stands about 4 feet 1 or 2 inches high at the shoulder ; the neck 
and head are small, the muzzle tapered, the horns from 6 to 8 
inches long, small at the points, and curved a little upwards. It 
is straight along the back, the limbs are slender, the udder well- 
shaped, of an oblong form, and full towards the front, the tail 
small and tapering, the countenance peculiarly mild and pleasing. 
When ordinarily fat, the 'carcase weighs from 28 to 36 stones 
141b. English to the stone. The prevailing colour is brown, 
or brown with a few small white spots. Swine rearing is some- 
what attended to bv farmers hi general, and the animal is fed to 
a great size. There is a considerable importation of pigs from 
Ireland, but they are not equal to those home-bred, and sell at a 
lower price.

Eminent Characters connected icith the Parish.— }. Sir Williani 
Mure of Rowallan, a pious and learned gentleman, the author of 
several poetical works, and particularly a metrical version of the 
Psalms of David. Principal BaiUie, who attended the Westmin- 
ster Assembly, as a Commissioner from the Church of Scotland,

preferred this version to that of Mr Rous, which was recom- 
mended by the Enghsh Parliament, adopted by the General As- 
sembly, and has ever since been used in Scotland. 

2. William, Earl of Kilmarnock, was attainted on account of 
his accession to the Rebellion in 1745, and beheaded at London 
m 1746. The capture of this nobleman, at the battle of Cul- 
loden, was attended by circumstances peculiarly affecting. Du- 
ring the confusion of the flight, being half-blinded by smoke and 
snow, he mistook a party of dragoons for the Pretender's horses, 
and was accordingly taken. He was soon after led along the lines 
of the British Infantry, in which his son, then a very young man, 
held the commission of an ensign. The Earl had lost his hat in 
the strife, and his long hair was flying in disorder around his head, 
and over his face. The soldiers stood mute in their lines, behold- 
ing the unfortunate nobleman. Among the rest stood Lord Kil- 
marnock, compelled by his situation to witness, without the power 
of alleviating, the humiliation of his father. When the Earl 
came past the place where his son stood, the youth, unable to 
bear any longer, that his father's head should be exposed to the 
storm, stepped out of the ranks, without regard to discipline, and 
taking off" his hat, placed it over his father's disordered and wind- 
beaten locks. He then returned to his place, without having ut- 
tered a word, while scarcely an eye that saw his filial aff"ection, 
but confessed its merit by a tear. 

3. The very Rev. Dr Robert Findlay, late Professor of Theo- 
logy in the University of Glasgow. The memory of this vene- 
rable man, who was equally distinguished by his extensive learn- 
ing, unfeigned piety, and unbending integrity, is fondly cherished 
by all who had the pleasure and advantage of studying under him. 

4. Sir James Shaw of Kilmarnock, who was Lord Mayor of 
the metropolis of the British Empire, though a native of the 
neighbouring parish uf Riccarton, spent his early life, and received 
his education in the town of Kilmarnock, and has for many years 
been the liberal patron of every institution which has for its object 
the improvement and comfort of its inhabitants. 

Historical Events.~lxx the year 1800, during a season of 
drought, a most destructive fire originated among some houses 
covered with thatch, in the lower part of the town or Netherton- 
holm, which, under the influence of a strong wind, spread, with 
amazing rapidity, on both sides of the street. Fortunately it was 

 Chambers's History of the Rebellion 1745.

during the day, and after much exertion, and unroofing several of 
the houses, the fire was got under, but not until it had rendered a 
number of families houseless and homeless. Their losses, how- 
ever, were speedily covered, by a hberal subscription among the 
other inhabitants, and by natives of the town, who had removed 
to England and foreign countries ; and their houses were ultimate- 
ly even improved, by being covered with slated roofs. 

On the 18th October 1801, being the Sabbath, the town was 
visited by another calamity still more memorable and disastrous. 
At that time the High Church happened to be vacant, and the con- 
gregation had no sermon on the above day. In consequence of 
this, the Low Church was much crowded; nothing, however, occur- 
red to create any alarm during Divine service in the forenoon. But 
in the afternoon, while the congregation were in the act of assem- 
bling, a fragment of plaster fell from the ceiling of the church. 
This produced in the minds of those who were already seated in 
the galleries, an apprehension that the roof was about to fall in. 
A rush towards the stairs instantly ensued, when those who were 
in the act of ascending were encountered by the descending co- 
lumn, and in a moment precipitated to the bottom. A heart- 
rending scene was now exhibited. Such a mass of human bodies 
were heaped on one another, that it was impossible, from the su- 
perincumbent weight, to render immediate assistance to those who 
were in the greatest danger. One layer of bodies after another 
was removed, until the passages were cleared ; but alas, it was too 
late, for it was found that twenty-nine of the sufferers had already 
expired. A number of them died from suffocation ; and others 
who survived were so severely bruised, that they never recovered 
their former health. This mournful event was altogether the ef- 
fect of a sudden panic, for the church was neither very old nor in 
a ruinous condition. The heritors, however, desirous to remove 
all apprehension from the public mind, immediately resolved to 
rebuild it, which accordingly was done in the following year. 

Land-owners.— The chief land-owners are, His Grace the Duke 
of Portland ; the Marchioness of Hastings and Moira ; William 
Blane of Grougar, Esq ; the Heirs of the late Mr James Porteous 
of Monkland ; William H. Crawford of Crawfurdland, Esq. ; John 
Parker of Aisloss, Esq.; James Dunlop of Annanhill, Esq.

till January 1663. From that period, almost nothmg is entered

till January 1665; but there are many omissions till August 4th 
1687, from which time it appears to have been regularly kept. 
The register of the exercise of discipline is dated as early as 1652 ; 
but, from the troubles of the period, it seems not to have been re- 
gularly kept till the Revolution in 1688. 

Antiquities. — The only antiquities which seem worthy of notice 
are, Dean Castle, Rowallan and Crawfurdland Castles, and Soules ' 
Cross. 

The Dean Castle stands about half a mile north-east from the 
town, and was the residence of the noble but unfortunate family 
of Kilmarnock. It is a very ancient edifice ; but no information can 
be obtained of the time when it was built. In the year 1735, it 
was entirely consumed by fire. This accident was occasioned by 
the mattention of a maid-servant, who was preparing some lint for 
spinning, which unhappily took fire, by which means this noble and 
ancient structure was laid in ruins. In this situation it still re- 
mains, and the hand of time is slowly destroying what the fury of 
the flames has spared. 

Rowallan Castle, from a remote period the residence of the ba- 
rons of Rowallan, stands on the banks of the Carmel water, about 
three miles north-west of the town. The principal and more or- 
namental part of the building was erected about the year 1562 : 
the more ancient tower is believed to have been the birth place of 
Elizabeth More, first wife of Robert the High Steward, afterwards 
King Robert II., of Scotland. This venerable mansion is beau- 
tifully enclosed among trees, in the hollow tract of the stream ; 
but is, under the unsparing hand of time, falling into decay. 

Crawfurdland Castle, the interesting and ancient seat of the 
Crawfurds of Crawfurdland, is situated about three miles to the 
north-east of the town. It has been built at different periods. 
The centre part of it, which is a fine Gothic structure, was erect- 
ed by the present most worthy representative of the family, who is 
also the descendant of the Howisons of Braehead. The oldest 
part or tower, whose walls are of great thickness, carries us back 
to a very remote antiquity. 

Soules Cross, which gives its name to one of the quarters of the 
town, was formerly a rude stone pillar, about eight or nine feet 
high, on the top of which was fixed a small gilded cross. This 
monument, which is situated at the south entrance of the High 
Church, was erected in memory of Lord Soules, an English noble-

AYRSHlllE. 



man, who is said to have been killed on the spot a. d. 1444, by 
an arrow from one of the Kihnarnock family. About twelve years 
ago, the inhabitants of that quarter of the town erected, at their 
own expense, in the wall which surrounds the burying-ground, and 
which fronts Soules Street, a niche, in which they placed a hand- 
some fluted pillar, surmounted by a vase. On the pediment is the 
following inscription : 

To the memory of Lord Soules, a. d. 1444. 
Erected by subscription, a. d. 1823. 
The days of old to mind I call. 

Modern Buildings. — About the beginning of the present cen- 
tury, the magistrates obtained an Act of Parliament for improving 
the town. This was much wanted, for the streets, like those of 
many of our old Scottish towns, were irregular and narrow. The 
Commissioners appointed by this act have, in a few years, effected 
a very great improvement. The principal street along which the 
great road from Glasgow to Ayr and Portpatrick passes, is very 
spacious, adorned with many elegant buildings and shops, and more 
than a mile in length. The houses are built of freestone, which is 
found in great abundance in the immediate neighbourhood, and 
the fronts are generally formed of polished ashler. — The town- 
house, a neat modern building, stands in the centre of the town, on 
an extended arch over the water of Kilmarnock. It consists of 
two stories with a belfry. — The butcher's market, which is con- 
tiguous, is erected on the same arch, which has now sustained, 
without any visible injury, this immense load for forty-seven years, 
with all the carriages which are constantly passing and repassing. — 
The Merchant's Society have built, at a great expense, a very ele- 
gant inn, which, while it affords the best accommodation to travel- 
lers, is a great ornament to the town. — The office of the Ayrshire 
Bank, which is directly opposite, is also a very elegant building. — 
The carpet factories, which are six in all, have either been rebuilt 
or greatly enlarged within these five years. These improvements 
have not only enabled the manufacturers to extend their business, 
but have greatly promoted the health and comfort of the opera- 
tives. There are five mills in the parish, four of which are situat- 
ed on the water of Kilmarnock, which passes through the town, 
and the fifth and largest on the Irvine, about a mile from the town. 
These are chiefly employed in spinning worsted or woollen yarn, 

for the carpet factories and bonnet-makers.

The population of the town and parish of -Kilmarnock was, in 1763, . 

by a return of Dr Webster, nearly . . ' 500O 

In 1792. . . . 6776

1831, Males, 8673 ; Females, 9420 j making in all 18093 
It is now believed to be about 20,000. 

The rapid advance which the town has made in the career of 
manufacturing industry has caused a great and rapid increase and 
influx of population. The numbers residing in the town may be 
reckoned nearly 18,000; in villages, 1000; in the country, between 
1000 and 1200. 

 It is impossible to state the annual number of births, as so 
many parents unhappily neglect to have their children's names in- 
serted in the parish register. The average of deaths for the seven 
years ending with December 1838 is about 460; and the averao-e 
of marriages proclaimed in these years is 196. 

There are no nobility, but several gentlemen of independent 
fortune, resident within the parish. The Duke of Portland ; the 
Marchioness of Hastings ; William Plane, Esq. of Grougar; and 
William Howieson Craufurd, Esq. of Craufurdland, are the prin- 
cipal heritors. 

The number of proprietors of land of the yearly value of L. 50 
and upwards does not exceed 10 or 12. 

The number of children in a family, in cases where there are 
children, judging from a specimen taken from the town, would 
seem to be nearly three and a fourth ; but though a numerous off- 
spring is often met with around the fireside of the working man, 
still, on striking an average of some hundreds of families, the num- 
ber of persons is just about four and a-half to a house. 

Character of the People.— T\\e inhabitants are in general indus- 
trious and well behaved, kind and hospitable, and in the country part 
of the parish especially, they are robust and hardy, supporting, by 
their vigorous proportions, the long established reputation of Ayr- 
shire for the quality of her peasantry, and affording a most favourable 
specimen of her » honest men and bonnie lasses." The habits and 
manners of the people of Kilmarnock are much the same as those of 
other manufacturing towns ; while it may be observed, that, among 
a large portion of them, there is very much of a decent church-going 
habit ; but the facility with which work can be procured for children 
and the tender age at which, from necessity, they are often withdrawn 
from school, are operating in a moral and religious point of view 



544 



AY USUI UE. 



seriously to the disadvantage of the rising generation. The Ayr- 
shire plaid is very generally worn by females. It is a noticeable pe- 
culiarity in their style of dress, and its simple drapery, when clean, 
is a comely ornament to their persons. 

Games. — The observances of Eastern's E'en were discontinued 
last year. These were principally races, and considered to be of 
.great antiquity, having been practised annually for the last five cen- 
turies. Bowl playing is much resorted to in the summer season. 
The ancient national game of curling has for a long period formed 
a prominent recreation in the parish, during frost in the winter 
months. We find it taken notice of as prevailing among the in- 
habitants, so early as the year 1644; and the curlers of Kilmarnock 
have long been, and still are, famed for the completeness of their 
equipments, and the proficiency they have attained in the more 
scientific departments of the game. There may be from 200 to 
SOO keen curlers in the parish, and during the long-continued 
frost of 1838, the palm of victory was carried off by " Auld KiUie," 
from all the surrounding parishes successively. 

There is a great deal of poaching, but no smuggling. It must 
be admitted that pawnbroking is on the increase, owing, perhaps, in 
no small degree, to the adversity occasioned to such a population 
by any stagnation in trade. In addition to one licensed broker, 
there are several unlicensed, who, being less scrupulous in their 
operations, are in many respects hurtful to this community. 

IV. — Industrv. 

Agriculture. — The parish has almost universally a rich soil, and 
is nearly all arable; and even that which is not arable, might, with 
a little expense and care, be rendered good pasture. In the east 
and north- east end, plantations of considerable extent are met with, 
but in the south-west, not one of any size is visible, which is the 
more to be wondered at, as they not only adorn, but enrich a coun- 
try by their intrinsic worth, and the shelter they afford. The en- 
tire appropriation of the fields, and the now almost universally used 
and well-dressed thorn -hedge, have left no undivided common. 

Rent.— Of the 8340 acres in the parish, 7470 yield an annual 
rental of from L. 1, 10s. to L. 1, 12s. per acre, though in some 
cases, near the town, fields are let at a much higher rate ; the re- 
maining 870 do not bring more than lis. per acre. The total 
rental is about L. 12,000. _ 

Grazing.— The charge of grazing varies of course with the 
quality of the pasture, but the average is L. 4 for an ox or cow. 



KILMARNOCK. 545 

Sheep are only occasional visitors to the rich herbage of most part 
of the parish; but where they are kept, 12s. is the annual charge 
for their pasture. 

Fae.— Ploughmen and other labourers connected with farm- 
work receive on an average L. 26 annually. An expense of about 
L. 33 in all is incurred, where they are kept by the farmer. Fe- 
male servants are paid at the rate of L. 18. If maintained by 
their masters, from L. 8 to L. 10 is a respectable fee. 

Mill-wrights, masons, and smiths receive, when the days are 
long, about 18s. weekly; in winter, from 12s. to 15s. Whilst 
the farmer has received 7s. 6d. per stone of 16 lbs. for his 
cheese, and 7s. for the same quantity of his beef, he has paid for 
manure, the produce of the horse and cow, 3s. 6d. per cubic yard ; 
town ashes. Is. 6d. ; Irish lime, Is. lOd. per boll of 4 bushels,' 
and Is. 4d. for the same quantity of Scotch. For 1000 of com- 
mon tiles used in draining, L. 1, 5s. is paid, and L. 3 for large 
ones. 

Prze.— The average price of oatmeal for a number of years 
back has been 17s. per boll of 170 lbs. imperial; of bear, L. 1, 
4s. per boll of 8 imperial bushels; of barley, L. 1, 9s. for the 
same boll; of white corn, 17s. for the same quantity; of wheat, 
L. 1, 4s. per boll of 4 imperial bushels; of beans and pease, 16s. 
for the same boll; potatoes have averaged lis. per 50 stones of 
16 lbs. 

Livestock.— We have only two kinds of sheep in the parish, the 
black-faced, and the common Cheviot. In the dairy, the Ayr- 
shire cow is alone used. An annual exhibition takes place in the 
town, at which prizes are awarded for the best specimens of the 
various kinds of cattle. Very few horses are reared, and these 
few are generally the produce of the common plough-horse of 
Clydesdale. 

Agricultural Associations.— l.ocs\ and general associations, whilst 
raising the character of the husbandry throughout Scotland, have 
nowhere extended their beneficial influence to more purpose than 
m this parish. Whilst the stock is changing, the farmers are not 
remammg unchanged. A considerable difference exists between 
their condition at present, and their state fifty years ago. Their 
manner of living is now more assimilated to that of the landlord. 
Their knowledge advances with that of general society, and, in the 
march of improvement, they are seen working their farms to the best 
advantage. In general, they are better able to pay their rents than

they were forty years ago. Whilst this is to be attributed, in a great 
degree, to the persevering industry of the tenants, something must 
be owing to the protection afforded by the Legislature, and not a lit- 
tle to the societies into which the agriculturists have formed them- 
selves, — by means of which, the combined knowledge of the best 
managers of the different kinds of crops on the different soils is 
'made known to all. The superior manner of feeding the dairy 
stock has added greatly to the returns yielded by it. It may be 
stated here, that we have in the parish 800 milch cows, 260 agri- 
cultural horses, 260 white-faced sheep, and about 300 black-faced 
sheep. 

Husbandry. — The manner of cropping varies ; but generally 
after four years pasture, the land is top-dressed and a crop of oats 
raised — the manure is applied with a green crop, such as potatoes, 
beans, or turnips, — then wheat or barley follows, and lastly hay and 
clover. In some parts, a continual succession of crops is practised, 
oats are reared one year, then a green crop with manure, then 
wheat, and lastly clover. . Experience has shown that, under such 
a mode of procedure, the soil rapidly deteriorates, though annual- 
ly supplied with abundance of manure. This latter system is in- 
jurious alike to landlord and tenant, while the former seems far 
the best for all parties and all soils. The quahty of the soil would 
be much better sustained, if it were richly manured ere the last 
crop is raised ; and to secure such an end, a premium might be of- 
fered for the best pasture, as the pasture must be good in propor- 
tion fo the richness of the soil ; besides, if a premium were propos- 
ed for the best oats, or first crop after pasture, tenants might be 
induced to allow the field to lie at rest a year or two longer, which 
is by far the best mode of enriching the soil. 

Improvements.— The principal advance made in agriculture con- 
sists, not so much in reclaiming waste land, as in improving that 

already reclaimed. 

An old writer, after informing us that the soil, which is frequent- 
ly only a foot deep, rests on a strong till, complains " that, in con- 
sequence, the autumnal rains which fall peculiarly heavy in the 
western parts of Scotland, having no longer the heat of the sun, 
as in summer, to exhale them, lie and stagnate on the surface of 
the ground during the whole winter, which greatly injures it, and 
for a time, even destroys its vegetative powers." The evil al- 
luded to has been greatly removed by tile-draining, an improve- 
ment introduced into the parish about the year 1820, by His 



KILMARNOCK. 



547 



 Grace the Duke of Portland. Since that time the practice 
has been followed, as far as the supply of tiles would admit; be- 
sides 800,000 made yearly in the parish, about 500,000 are im- 
ported from the Moorfield tile-works, in the immediate neighbour- 
hood. About a third of the parish has already undergone this 
improving process,— by which an addition of about L. 500 has 
been made to the rental ; and what were formerly the 'worst and 
most unproductive fields, now yield the best crops. The plan 
followed by His Grace is as follows : he prepares the tiles, and 
puts them into the ground. The farmer drives and lays them 
out, providing straw, if required, which is the case in stubble 
or fallow land. The drains are generally placed about 18 feet 
apart, and m clay land are cut to the depth of 18 inches. Where 
the bottom of the drain is soft or the land steep, soles are put un- 
der the tiles to prevent them from sinking or losing their regu- 
larity ; when the field is 250 or 300 yards in length, a main drain 
IS drawn through the middle of it, to prevent the drain from be- 
commg choked, and the same thing is done in cases where hol- 
lows intervene. A main drain is also drawn across the end of the 
field, to receive the waters from the furrow drains. These main 
conductors are about 2 feet deep, considerably wider than the com- 
mon drains, and the tiles always rest on flat soles. For the im- 
provement of land and consequent increase of produce hereby 
caused, the farmer pays His Grace 5s. per Scotch acre. In some 
mstances, other proprietors follow the same plan ; in others, the 
tenant is allowed to purchase the tiles at prime cost, and bear all 
the expense of putting them in. The disadvantages of this latter 
mode are obvious; in many cases, a farmer does not think it pro- 
per to lay out such a sum on land which may ere long pass into 
the hands of another; and frequently, though willing, he does not 
possess the necessary capital,— upwards of L. 500 being required 
to dram a farm consisting of 100 acres. All encouragement should 
be given to this mode of fertilizing the soil, the best which has 
been practised for a century; and that encouragement, we con- 
ceive, may be best and most judiciously bestowed by adoptino- the 
plan followed by His Grace the Duke of Portland. 

Leases generally extend to eighteen years. Until the introduc- 
tion of the present mode of regulating the rent by the prices of 
gram, the longest lease was the best for the tenant. The im 
provement of trade naturally increased the population, and a con- 
sequent increased demand was made on the farmer. The gradual 



548 



AYUSHIRE. 



increase of produce and price fell totally to the tenant if the lease 
were long, and the landlord was not benefited at all. Now that the 
prices are steady, an extension of the lease from eighteen to twenty- 
four years might be advantageous to both parties. The tenant 
would have more scope for improvements. Instead of impoverish- 
ing the land by taking as much out, and putting'as little in as pos- 
sible, it would be for his own profit to sustain the quality of the soil. 
The landlord whilst receiving his rent would have the value of his 
property maintained, if not increased. In former times, when leases 
were very long, and rents very moderate, few realized any thing; 
they had no spur to improvement or diligence ; a little trouble en- 
abling them to sustain their families and pay their rents, they grew 
no better, the land remained as it was, and the landlord knew not 
and received not the value of his soil. 

A better state of things, we conceive, now exists ; while the rent 
is not too high, it is high enough to call forth the talents of the 
cultivator, that he may be enabled to maintain his rank in society, 
and keep his credit with the proprietor. 

New modes of procedure are adopted, invention is at work, and 
he is the best tenant who raises the most food on the smallest space. 

Much difference of opinion exists regarding the best size of 
farms, which in the parish vary from bO to 200 acres ; some hold- 
ing that they should be all small, others that two or three small 
ones should be united so as to form a larger farm, and allow 
some scope for enterprise and improvement. We hold neither opi- 
nion exclusively, but think that they should be of all sizes, from 60 
to 200 acres. Then would there be a fair field for men of skill and 
energy, whatever might be the amount of their capital ; various 
ranks would be admitted to share in the contest, for contest it has 
become ; and various no doubt would be the results ; as different as 
the spirits and the soils engaged in the work. 

Farm~Buildinqs.—mmestic comfort is an object all men have 
in view, and whel'-e this is not contemplated by the landlord, the ex- 
ertions of the tenant are not likely either to be spirited or success- 
ful Nothino- contributes to it more directly than substantial and 
convenient houses. In the old Statistical Account, heavy com- 
plaints are made against the negligence of proprietors in this re- 
spect ; but since then, the ground of remonstrance has been almost 
universally removed, and good substantial ferm-steadmgs are every- 
where to be met with,-an improvement which increases the value 
of an estate in a ratio much greater than the expense incurped. In 



KILMARNOCK. 549 

some cases, the tenant pays 5 or 6 per cent, on the sum laid out; 
but in a greater number of instances, the proprietor provides every 
requisite accommodation without exacting any thing except the in- 
dispensable obligation to keep the houses and offices in proper re- 
pair. Cottages are universally neater than they used to be, and 
cottar vies with cottar in keeping his little house and garden in 
seemly order. 

Ploughs. — Various kinds of ploughs have been introduced. That 
generally used, and which has been found to work best, is the -weW 
known iron plough of Mr Wilkie of Uddingstone ; it has gone for 
many years araongour fields. Various instruments, the production of 
the same enterprising mechanic, have a preference given them, such 
as those used for green cropping and cleaning the ground. Many of 
the smiths and Wrights in the parish are making the same kinds of 
implements, and, in not a few cases, are suggesting improvements 
on the originals, such as the harrow, the roller, the cleaner, the 
grubber, &amp;c. 

The subsoil or deepening plough has been tried with great suc- 
cess. The furrow, being ten or twelve inches deep, is much liked for 
opening and mixing the under stratum with the ordinary surface 
soil. The instruments used for the drilling, cleaning, and hoeing 
of the green crops, beans, potatoes, and turnips, are various, and 
the best used in the country. They are made of iron and oak, and 
are neat and substantial. Farm carts, which are all drawn by a 
single horse, are not very large, the box containing rather" more 
than a cubic yard. Thrashing-mills may be mentioned among the 
general improvements; every farm of even sixty acres has one. 
Horse power is used in working them, and the number is regulated 
by the size of the mill. Would not steam power be better The 
horses would be fitter for out-door work, and in many cases a horse 
or two fewer would suffice for the farm. Along with thrashing, 
have been introduced grinding-mills. In the east end of the pa- 
rish, we have the Milton and Crooksmills ; in the middle, the New 
Mill and Rowallan ; and in the west end, Cambuskethan Mill. The 
Milton, New, and Cambuskethan, grind flour, the other two grind 
oats chiefly ; they are situated on and worked by the Irvine and 
Kdmarnock waters. Another general improvement is the constant 
supply of water for the mills and manufactories in the town, obtain- 
ed from extensive reservoirs formed of the Kilmarnock water in the 
high lands of the adjoining parish of Fenwick.

Besides the above grain, there are a few bolls of beans made 
into meal at each of these mills, but the amount varies, and is not 
easily ascertained. 

In the progress of agriculture, the change is very striking, and 
perhaps no district of Scotland has undergone so much improve- 
ment. In 1792, there was but a comparatively small portion of 
the land under cultivation, and that quantity yielded inferior crops. 
Almost none of the present improved modes of farming were then 
known ; the husbandry implements were of a rude and imperfect 
kind ; and tile-draining, the modern charm for fertilizing the soil, 
was not dreamt of.

Considerable quantities of grain are imported from Ireland into 
the parish, and made into meal and flour at the different mills. 
A large proportion of the oats grown in the parish and converted 
into meal is conveyed to Glasgow, Paisley, and other markets, 
where it is rapidly bought up. 



KILMARNOCK.

Potatoes are cultivated in tins parish to a considerable extent. 
The raising of the turnip also forms an important care to the agri- 
culturist, as by its culture the land is cleansed and improved. On 
its produce, the cattle are fed for the dairy and for slaughter, and 
flocks of sheep, generally purchased at the Falkirk market, are fed 
on it, in an ingenious way, by means of flakes or moveable palings, 
which also prevent them from rambling over the field. 

The progress of agriculture was early promoted by an Agricul- 
tural Society, formed in Kilmarnock in 1792, which continues still 
in active operation, and which, during its long career, has been 
most useful in stimulating the exertions of the enterprizing and in- 
genious farmer. Various gentlemen in and around the town have 
lent their aid to this institution ; and, of late years much of its 
prosperity has been owing to the practical knowledge and perse- 
vering exertions of Mr George Paxton, formerly its secretary. • 

Manufactures. — The manufactures of Kilmarnock are various, 
and some of them very extensive. The manufacture of worsted 
printed shawls alone employs 1200 weavers, and about 200 prin- 
ters. Between May 1830 and the 1st of June 1831, there were 
1,128,814 of these shawls manufactured, the value of which 
amounted to about L. 200,000. The annual value now is estimat- 
ed at L. 230,000. This important branch of trade was introduced 
into Scotland in 1824, at Greenholm printfield here, by Mr Wil- 
liam Hall, anjngenious and enterprizing calico-printer, and afforded 
great relief when the muslin weaving was in a very depressed stale. 
• In the carpet factories, about 1200 persons are employed in 
weaving Brussels, Venetian, Turkey, and Scotch carpets and rugs, 
the quality and patterns of which are not surpassed by any in 
Britain. The annual value of this branch of trade is about 
L. 150,000. The Commissioners and Trustees for Manufactures, 
&amp;c. in Scotland, awarded in the competition for premiums for 
1831, to Gregory, Thomson, and Company, for four carpets Tur- 
key fabric, L. 1 50, and an extra premium of L. 30. And the 
judges expressed the following opinion : The four carpets of the 
Turkey fabric, the first, it is believed, that ever were made in Scot- 
land, the judges thought deserved most particular notice ; that they 
are of a splendid description, and form an important addition to 
the Scottish manufactures, and fully entitle the spirited manufac- 
Uirers to the Hberal premiums adjudged to them. The premiums 
awarded to Kilmarnock amounted in all, in 1831, to L. 210, 

The manufacture of boots and shoes is very considerable. About 



552 



AYIISHIRE. 



2400 pairs of shoes are made per week, of which three-fourths 
are exported. The annual value of this branch of trade is about 
L. 60,000. 

There are about 18,720 of bonnets manufactured annually by 
the Corporation of Bonnet- Makers, the value of which is about 
L. 12,000. 

The number of sheep and lamb skins dressed annually exceeds 
140,000. There are three tan-works, in which the trade of tan- 
ning and currying are carried on extensively, and the annual value 
of leather manufactured is estimated at L. 45,000. 

Besides these several branches, there are extensive manufactures 
of machinery, telescopes, tobacco, candles, hats, hosiery, and sad- 
dlery. The trade in grocery goods, victuals, and liquors, may 
amount to at least L. 16,000; and of cloths, silks, linens, cot- 
tons, and hose, there may be retailed to the annual amount of at 
least L. 70,000. There is also an extensive trade in field and 
garden seeds. 

Men, women, and children, work in these manufactures six days 
per week, and most ten hours per day, and some twelve hours. And 
when thus prosecuted steadily, the manufactures afford a fair remu- 
neration and support to those engaged in them. The severest pri- 
vations of the operatives arise from the frequent recurrence of stag- 
nations of trade, and the attendant want of public confidence. And 
it must be added, with sorrow, that some of the working classes 
increase their difficulties by their improvidence, and intemperate 
habits when trade is good. Here there is no complete remedy. 
After humanity has exercised all her ingenuity, and put forth all 
her strength, much distress has been experienced. 

The carpet manufacturers in Kilmarnock are eminently indebt- 
ed to the inventive genius of Mr Thomas Morton of this town, a 
self-instructed mechanist, who, by his improvements in machinery, 
has eflfected a considerable saving in time and manual labour, and 
secured a greater variety and accuracy in the patterns. This ac- 
tive genius has now turned his attention to the construction of teles- 
copes, and has built, at his own expense, a fine observatory with 
valuable machinery, and two telescopes of a very superior descrip- 
tion. From the high character of these instruments, he has 
been called to supply with them various other observatories. 
As a grateful memorial of these obligations to their townsman, 
the manufacturers of Kilmarnock presented him with a massy 
silver punch-bowl, with the following inscription : " Presented by 



KILMARNOCK. 



553 



the inhabitants of Kilmarnock, to Thomas Morton of Morton 
Place, a mechanic, whose inventive genius has eminently contri- 
buted to the prosperity of their manufactures, 1826." 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market- Toiv7i. — Kilmarnock is the only market-town in the pa- 
rish. There are two or three small villages between the town and the 
eastern boundary of the parish ; and several occupied by the colliers 
to the west. The market-days in Kilmarnock are Tuesday and 
Friday, when much business is transacted between the agricultural 
and manufacturing population, to their mutual advantage. 

Police. — The police establishment, though not extensive, is kept 
by the commissioners of police in vigorous operation, and is very 
efficient. There is perhaps no town of the same size in Britain, 
where the persons and property of the inhabitants are more secure 
than they are in Kilmarnock. 

Means of Communication. — These are ample and sufficient for 
all the purposes of commerce, and external communication. There 
is one post-office, which yields a considerable revenue. This has 
increased of course with the trade of the town. The chief of the 
turnpike roads is the great thoroughfare between Glasgow and Port- 
patrick, which passes th rough the parish, where its breadth from north 
to south may be about three and a-half or four miles,— and through 
the town, where its length may be about one mile and a quarter. 
Four coaches ply daily between Kilmarnock and Glasgow, one 
between Kilmarnock, Irvine, and Ardrossan, and one between 
Kilmarnock and Edinburgh, by Loudon and Strathaven. There 
are two or three turnpike roads which intersect the landward parish 
m different directions, of no great extent, but which are all kept in 
good repair. 

Bridffes.—There are five bridges over the water of Kilmarnock 
within the town, all in excellent repair. And two over the Irvine, 
between Kilmarnock and Riccarton, in the same condition. 

The roads in the parish are commodious, and kept in excellent 
repair, and there have been many improvements, especially of 
late, effected upon them, which render them equal probably to any 
in Great Britain. The old streets of the town are narrow and 
inconvenient, but all the modern thoroughfares are spacious and 
handsome. No town possesses more ample means of communica- 
tion with the surrounding country. The intercourse with Glasgow, in 
particular, is very frequent, and the rapidly increasing number of 
carriers is a sure indication that trading is on the increase. It is 



554 



AYRSHIRE. 



to be lamented, however, that Kilmarnock is not likely to partici- 
pate in the advantages of an immediate communication with the 
Glasgow and Ayrshire railway. It was the wish of the directors of 
the railway to have brought it through a place so important, but 
the difficulty of finding a practicable level prevented so desirable 
an object. 

The railway, which runs from Kilmarnock to Troon, is another 
great advantage to the parish. The practicability and usefulness 
of such a line were long since clearly pointed out. The difference 
of the respective elevations of the depots is only 80 feet. It was 
finished, in I8I2 at an expense of upwards of L. 50,000. It is a 
double road, constructed with flat rails, resting on blocks of durable 
stone. Its length is nine miles and a-half. Horse power alone is 
used, for which ld. per ton per mile is paid. The dues are 2d. 
a mile per ton. We may mention that, in 1816, a locomotive en- 
gine, the first of the kind started in Scotland, was tried. It was 
intended to convey coal to Troon from the Duke of Portland's col- 
liery, but, from its defective construction and ill adaptation to flat 
rails, it only drew ten tons at the rate of five miles an hour. Since 
then, no attempt has been made to introduce steam power. As it 
will in a few years very possibly become a branch of the western 
railway, several changes may take place in its construction, and it 
is not unlikely that the only propelling power used will be steam. 
By means of this railway, there is free intercourse with the harbour 
of Troon. Quantities of timber, grain, slates, and lime, are brought 
into the parish, and about 70,000 tons of coal annually conveyed 
out of it. About 200,000 tons pass along it in the course of the 
year. The farmer gets lime cheaply conveyed to his farm, — the 
landlord's property is increased in value by the facility of commu- 
nication with the market-town, and the public have a ready means 
of transport to convenient watering-places. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish of Kilmarnock is one in civil 
matters; but the name embraces the High Church parish, which 
lies in the town, and is disjoined quoad sacra. The Laigh or ori- 
ginal parish church is situated in the heart of the town, two miles 
from the western extremity of the parish, and seven from the north- 
east boundary ; and though at such a distance from some of the 
population, it could not with propriety be placed otherwise. It 
was rebuilt in 1802, with a commodious square staircase at each 
angle, conducting to the galleries, — a precaution adopted in con- 
sequence of the melancholy occurrence in 1801, already noticed.

It has since been repaired in 1831, at an expense of about 
L. 1200. It affords- sittings for 1457 persons,— the number of 
seats allotted to the poor being only 16. The spire is believed 
to have been built in 1410. Being a collegiate church, there are 
two manses and two glebes. The manse attached to the first 
charge was built about 1763, and repairs and additions were made 
m 1780 and 1802. The glebe extends to 12 acres ; and its pre- 
sent annual value is about L. 30. Both ministers are entitled to 
no more than the minimum stipend of L. 150, the teinds being 
exhausted. The manse of the second charge was erected in 1826 ; 
and having been superficially finished, has required to be repeat- 
edly and considerably repaired. The glebe consists of 4 acres, 
partly occupied by manse, offices, &amp;c. and yields at present in 
grass L. 12 a-year. A new and handsome place of worship, in 
the Gothic style, with a very elegant front and massive tower, was 
lately built in the town by subscription, and opened in 1836, ca- 
pable of containing about 1700 sitters ; but as the debt upon it is 
considerable, and no separate parish has yet been assigned to it, 
the duty, by a temporary arrangement, is done by the two mini- 
sters of the collegiate church alternately. 

Since the year 1834, there has been a missionary in the parish, 
paid by means of an annual voluntary subscription, and employed 
as an additional labourer in the midst of our crowded town popu- 
lation ; and there has, moreover, been for some time a service in 
an old chapel in the village of Crooked Holm, conducted by a li- 
centiate of the church who resides there. 

Within the Laigh parish quoad sacra, there is a large place of 
worship belonging to the Relief Synod, which is rather remarkable 
■ irom Its being ornamented with a tall spire, and having a bell for 
summoning the meetings of the congregation. The Cameronians, 
the United Secession, and the Independents, have each a meeting- 
house ; and a small body of Original Seceders assemble for wor- 
ship in a hall of the academy. 

The parish quoad sacra contains between 16,000 and 17,000 
inhabitants In February 1836, an ecclesiastical survey was made, 
which, although not quite completed, was the means of ascer- 
taining the situation of about 15,200 of the people. The same ' 
questions being asked in every house, 8957 were returned as be- 
longing to the Established Church ; 6119 as connected with other 
denominations of all sorts ; and 174 as not known to belong to any 
denomination. The Established Church must have suffered most

materially during a long period, since, while the number of inha- 
bitants of the whole parish was rising from perhaps between 3000 
and 4000 to 20,000, there had not been a new place of worship 
erected in connexion with the Church of Scotland for more than a 
hundred years. Although the number of careless persons is unhap- 
pily great, the general body of the people show the utmost respect 
for the sacred ordinances of religion, — the average number of com_ 
municants in the Low and St Marnock's Churches jointly being 
1600, and there being still amongst us no small portion of the an- 
cient west country Presbyterian feeling and love of the Gospel. 
The Roman CathoUcs in the Low parish, who are nearly all Irish, 
were believed, in October 1836, to amount to between 600 and 
700. Their priest is stationed in Ayr, and visits them periodically. 
The bishop resides in Glasgow. 

Besides a male and a female benevolent society, and a dispen- 
sary, there are a female society for religious purposes, whose funds 
amount to about L. 30 a-year ; and a parochial association recently 
established for promoting the religious schemes of the General 
Assembly, and other missionary purposes. 

It may also be mentioned, that a library has lately been esta- 
blished by subscription, in connexion with the parish church and 
St Marnock's, as a means of promoting a taste for sound reading 
and the Christian instruction of all classes. It has been named 
the Mackinlay Library, in honour of an aged minister, who, in his 
eighty-second year, retains the buoyant spirit and fire of youth, 
and who has for more than half a century been highly and deserv- 
edly popular as a divider of the word of truth among this people. 

High Church.— The High Church parish is confined to the 
upper ward of the town, and from this circumstance the parish 
derives its name ; for though its elevation is not great, it is a few 
feet higher than the site of the- Low Church, which is the original 
parish. The plan has been borrowed from St Martins-in-the- 
Fields, London, which is reckoned the most successful effort of 
Gibb, the Scottish architect. The plan, however, is stript of 
many of the ornaments of the original, as executed in the High 
Church, and particularly of the splendid portico. The exterior 
is plain, and the elevation of the tower may be about 80 feet. The 
interior is well lighted ; and the roof, which is a piece of finished 
workmanship, is supported by a double row of elegant pdlars, of 
the composite order. It contains 952 sittings, is about a square 
within, and an oblong square without, and is kept in the best re-

pair. And though 106 years have passed away since its erection, 
it has still the appearance of great neatness, comfort, and dura- 
bility. The avenues from the south and the north are lined by 
rows of beautiful limes. 

As the church was built from subscriptions raised among the 
operatives, resident chiefly in the town, for their own accommoda- 
tion, it became their property, and was divided among them in 
shares proportioned to the amount of their subscriptions. For 
many years it was placed on the footing of a chapel of ease, and 
received a constitution from the General Assembly. But in 1811, 
with the consent of His Grace the Duke of Portland, the patron j 
of the ministers of the Low Church ; of the presbytery of the 
bounds; and of three-fourths of the valuation of the landward he- 
ritors, — the proprietors instituted, in the Court of Teinds, a process 
of disjunction and erection into a separate parish quoad sacra, 
which terminated favourably on the 19th of June the same year. 

The minister's stipend is not to be under 115 bolls of victual, 
half meal, half bear, yearly, and not to exceed 144 bolls, pay- 
able in money, according to the highest fiars prices of the county 
of Ayr, together with a sufficient sum for furnishing communion 
elements. The minister receives the maximum. He has neither 
manse nor glebe, but he receives the Government allowance in 
lieu of them. 

There are two Dissenting chapels in the parish : the one is con- 
nected with the Original Burgher Synod, and the other with the 
United Associate Synod. Both are respectably filled, but what 
amount of stipends their ministers receive, the writer of this has 
no means of knowing. 

The High Church is well filled, and the number of communi- 
cants averages about 500.

Benefactions. — The late Mrs Mary Cuninghame, relict of the

AYRSHIRE. 



late Captain Archibald Cuningliame, of his Majesty's 51st Re- 
giment of Foot, by her disposition and settlement in 1820, left 
to the minister of the High Church parish of Kilmarnock, and 
his successors in office, thcsum of L. 200, to be lent out on pro- 
per security, and the interest applied yearly to assist in the sup- 
port of ten poor families in Kilmarnock, not on "the session, whe- 
ther in the High or Low Church parishes, in such proportion as 
the minister of the High Church for the time may direct. Also 
the late John MacNider, Esq. merchant in Quebec, left to the 
minister of the High Church, Kilmarnock, the sum of L. 40 for 
behoof of the poor within the High Church parish, as the said 
minister may direct. The above sums to be lent also on proper 
security, and the interest only applied to the poor. 

As the sessional funds are at present derived from an assess- 
ment, which is levied both from landward and town heritors, and 
which is found to be very heavy, there are no general collections 
for the poor. The annual amount collected at the High Church 
for religious purposes may be about L. 40. 

Education. — There are in the landward part of the parish three 
schools, and three teachers, and in the town twenty schools, and 
twenty-eight teachers in all, including male and female. The first 
in importance is the academy, which was built in 1807, at the joint 
expense of the heritors and community. This is merely an ex- 
tension of the parochial system, and seems well adapted for large 
towns. In consequence of the rapid increase of the population, 
the heritors and other inhabitants, convinced of the great benefits 
derived from the parochial system of education, appointed three 
teachers in the parochial school, that is the academy, one for the 
classics, one for English, and one for the commercial department. 
The first is the parochial teacher, who is the classical teacher, and 
who is allowed the maximum salary by the heritors, with a house 
and garden sufficiently large to accommodate several boarders ; the 
second and third teachers have each L. 15 per annum without 
house or garden. 

Upwards of 300 pupils attend the academy, at which are taught 
the following branches, viz. the English language in all its depart- 
ments, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, mathematics, geography, 
ancient and modern, Latin, Greek, French, and Enghsh composi- 
tion. The direction is vested in, 1. five directors chosen annu- 
ally from the heritors ; 2. five directors chosen annually from the 
Town- Council ; 3. the three clergymen of the Established 



KILMARNOCK. 



559 



Churchy ex officiis ; 4. subscribers of L. 20 and upwards ; 5. five 
directors chosen annually from subscribers of L. 5, and under 
L. 20 ; 6. the preses of the Merchant's Society, as representing 
L. 50 subscribed by them. These directors are authorized to choose 
the teachers as vacancies occur, and to fix the rate of fees. 

There are two branches of the parish school, one in Rowallan, 
and the other in Grougar barony. They have each a house for 
school and master, half a chalder of victual, and a small garden. 
The half chalder is meanwhile paid voluntarily by the heritors to 
the teacher at Rowallan, because he has not yet been appointed 
according to the terms of the schoolmaster's act; but the payment- 
to the teacher in Grougar is now regularly assessed for, as he was 
lately chosen in the manner prescribed by law. The heritors act- 
ed on the occasion in the most liberal manner, having subscribed a 
handsome sum to aid the inhabitants of the district, the lord of the 
manor, and other contributors, in erecting a commodious house. 

Upwards of 2000 pupils attend the other schools of the town 
and parish, at which, taken collectively, the above-mentioned 
branches are taught, with the addition of sewing and music. 
Two of the schools in town were erected for the reception of 
the children of the poor, whose education would otherwise have 
been neglected, and are supported by a subscription among 
the inhabitants generally. The first is the female school of 
industry, patronised by the ladies, jn which about twenty-five 
girls are taught English reading, n'eedle-work, and knitting of 
stockings. The teacher, who is also a female, has a salary of L. 20 
per annum. The second is the free school, patronized by the 
gentlemen. In this school, there are two departments, viz. the day- 
school and the evening class. Into the day-school, orphans and 
neglected boys and girls are admitted indiscriminately, on the pro- 
duction of a certificate from one of the managers, that they are not 
under five and a half years of age. In this department, English 
reading and writing are taught without any expense whatever, and 
the average number of scholars is about 1 90. Into the evening 
class, boys and girls more advanced in age, who are employed du- 
ring the day in some of the pubHc works, are admitted, and the 
average number of scholars is about 90. The teacher is allowed 
a salary of L. 50 per annum. In all the schools the Shorter Ca- 
techism is taught, and the Bible is one of the school-books. 

There are in the town and landward parish 21 Sabbath evening 



560 



AYKSHIllE. 



schools, which are conducted by 142 teachers, and in which there 
are 1288 scholars. 

We may here notice, that the late William Paterson, Esq. of 
Ayr, left L. 90 a-year, to be apportioned by nine trustees amongst 
young persons at school in Kilmarnock, applying for the same; 
in order to promote emulation among the scholars, and to aid in 
completing their education, whether here or elsewhere. 

The number of youths who cannot read or write, is very incon- 
siderable. The natives of Kilmarnock, in general, are fully alive 
to the benefits of education, and covet them above all things for 
their children. They struggle hard to render them scholars, and 
if possible great scholars. There are, however, exceptions, but 
these are not numerous, and occur chiefly among those who are 
natives of Ireland, or who have become poor and indifferent about 
the education of their children, from the frequent use of ardent 
spirits. The free school and the school of industry furnish a 
remedy for this evil ; for neglected children are readily admitted 
into both, on application on the part of their parents. But the 
greatest enemy to education in this and other commercial towns, 
is a disposition on the part of poor parents to avail themselves of 
the fruits of their children's industry. They can often procure em- 
ployment for them in some of the factories, when, for the small 
sum of 2s. or 3s. per week, they are daily confined ten or twelve 
hours. As far as can be ascertained, there are about 200 adults 
who cannot read or write, who are mostly natives of Ireland. The 
general diffusion of education in the parish undoubtedly exerts a 
most salutary influence on the conduct and morals of the inhabi- 
tants. But there are two counteracting causes. The first is, the 
constant influx of strangers, chiefly from Ireland, who have not en- 
joyed the same advantages, and who, mingling with the natives, 
imperceptibly influence their moral habits. The second is, the 
great number of Hcenses to retail ardent spirits in inns, shops, and 
cellars, which are issued. Thus, the temptations to intemperance 
are indefinitely multiplied, the morals of the people are gradually 
deteriorated, and all the ties of society are corroded and weaken- 
ed. The revenue, indeed, is increased, but the depravation of 
morals is the consequence. 

The inhabitants of Kilmarnock have ever been distinguished for 
their attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, and the prui- 
ciples of the Revolution. When Lord Kilmarnock, in 1745, re- 

• Chambers' History. 



KILMARNOCK. 561 

quested them to arm themselves in behalf of the house of Stu- 
art, they obstinately refused. His Lordship assembled them in 
the town hall, and tried them first with entreaties, and then with 
threats, but not one would consent to join his standard. He then 
confined his demands to their arms, for bonnet-makers and weavers 
as they were, they still retained the old muskets and rusty shab- 
bies of their Covenantingancestors, and occasionally displayed them 
at -bloodless wapping-shaws. But this requisition they were pre- 
pared to resist; and one of them had even the hardihood to tell 
his Lordship, that, if they presented him with their guns, it would 
be with the muzzle till him.  

Literature -The town library is very valuable, both from the 
number of the books, and their character. It is particularly rich 
in the different branches of history. The members of the society 
subscribe 7s. annually, and the entry-money cannot exceed L. 2 
1 here is, besides, a mechanics institution, which has attached to it 
a respectable collection of appropriate books. 

There are in town two reading-rooms, one for operatives, and 
the other for their masters, and both are supplied with such news- 
papers, reviews, and public documents, as the readers iud-e to be 
most interesting and instructive. But many of the inhabitants pre- 
fer reading the public prints hy their own fireside, where their fa- 
milies also may hear and obtain this indulgence by forming them- 
selves into small circles of readers, which are kept in order by the 
observance of regulations which are of their own formation 

There are two newspapers published weekly in town, the one de- 
sxgnedie Kilmarnock Journal, and the other the Ayrshire Exami- 
ner. The Journal, which has been several years in the course of pub- 
lication, has obtamed an encouraging extent of circulation. The 
iixaminer, which commenced its literary career only about five 
weeks ago, still awaits the award of the public. Both these prints 
are conducted by editors who, it is believed, are well qualified for 
the task which they have undertaken. 

hrTf This institution was esta- 

bhshed twelve years ago, for the relief of the poor who are unable 

mos of the medical practitioners in town, who attend in reo-uhu- 
rotation, and cheerfully render their gratuitous assistance. The 
expenses incurred by medicines, house rent, &amp;c. are defrayed bv 
subscriptions among the inhabitants at large. The subscHptions

AYR. ,

have usually covered the expenditure. These facts demonstrate, 
that there exists in the mind of the public a conviction of the 
utility of the institution. The town is divided into fourteen dis- 
tricts; these are apportioned among the medical gentlemen, as 
near as possible to their respective locations, and each is taken in 
every day charge by a surgeon, for the period of at least twelve 
consecutive months. This plan has fully realized the anticipations 
of its advocates. While it has diminished the expenditure, it has 
by no means pressed heavily upon the medical attendants, and they 
have had the satisfaction of doing something like justice to their 
patients. The average income and expenditure is L. 50. Durmg 
the year 1835, the cases admitted for treatment were 243, being 
somewhat more than an average number since the commencement. 
During that year, there were comparatively few epidemic diseases. 
The list of diseases contains only five cases of small-pox, all of 
which terminated favourably. The number of fever cases amount- 
ed to 45, of these five were fatal. In 1831, there were 105 cases 
of fever; and in 1832, the appalling number of 246. Since that 
period, the ravages of this disease have been comparatively slight. 
During 183-3, the admissions under that head amounted to 43, 
and in 1834 only to 15. 

Savings Bank.— The savings bank was instituted in June 1821, 
and is found to be of great utility. The depositors are chiefly la- 
bourers, operatives, and maid-servants. At the commencement of 
the institution, many of these classes did not well understand its 
nature ; and some of them even suspected that the Government 
had some design on their purses. But explanations by the clergy- 
men, and the publication of the annual reports, have completely 
removed their suspicions. They now appreciate its merits, and 
avail themselves of the opportunity thus offered to them, to depo- 
sit their savings where they are perfectly secure, and constantly 
increasing by the accumulation of interest. The bank leceives 
sums from Is. to L. 10. The depositors are required to withdraw 
their savin0S when they amount to L. 10, being such a sum as an- 
other banL will receive. And many of them have actually trans- 
ferred this sum to the other banks, and finding themselves richer 
than they ever expected to become, they have taken courage and 
opened new accounts. The number of the individuals that have 
taken the benefit of the institution since its commencement, to tne 
31st of May 1837, is 3156. The number that had accounts open 
at the same date, 955.

Friendly Societies. — There are 37 Friendly Societies in the 
town, some of which are of recent formation, and others have 
existed for more than twenty years. In some of them, the mem- 
bers are all females, but in most of them they are males. In one 
of the foi 'mer, the object is to provide for female servants who have 
become infirm, or who are worn out by age and labour : Another, 
the Kilmarnock Female Benevolent Society, which has existed for 
thirty years, and which has been eminently useful, extends its as- 
sistance to poor females in general : Another, which is supported 
by gentlemen, provides the same objects towards poor males. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — Pauperism, which had been kept 
in check while the funds for the support of the poor were raised 
by voluntary contribution, is now, under the compulsory system of 
assessment, on the increase. The number of natives of the sister 
isle, who have acquired a residence in the parish, and whose names 
stand upon the pauper's roll, is considerable; and, notwithstand- 
ing noble exceptions, there is much more, than once there was, of 
a disposition among many of our own poor to look upon parochial 
relief as a right rather than a painful resort. ■ 

The lowest sum allowed to any pauper is 2s. a month, the highest 
8s., unless in very peculiar circumstances. House-rents are paid for 
paupers to the amount of about L. 120 yearly. The number of cases 
at present on the poor's roll is about 277 ; and as many of these 
cases include families or more individuals than one, the number of 
persons receiving some aid is perhaps 500. 

The year's assessment may be said to average about L, 1500. 
Formerly, the assessment was raised in equal proportions from the 
town and country heritors. Afterwards, four-tenths were furnish- 
ed by the country heritors, and six-tenths by the town ; but by a 
late judgment of the Court of Session, it has been decided that 
the assessment shall be laid on, one-half on the whole heritable 
property, and the other on the means and substance of the haill 
inhabitants of the town and parish ; and as the town rental consi- 
derably exceeds that of the country, the proportion is altered to 
rather more than seven-tenths to the town, and less than three- 
tenths upon the landward part of the parish. Under the voluntary 
mode of assessment, the chief part of the town's share was, at one 
period, made up by collections at the church doors of churchmen 
and Dissenters ; but as matters now stand, there is an assessment 
laid on the means and substance of the inhabitants by stent-mas- 
ters, appointed to estimate the ability of each rate-payer. Under 



564 



AYRSHIRE. 



the head of legacies and mortifications, it falls to be stated, that 
the late Dr Hunter of London vested money in the funds to yield 
L. 50 a-year to the poor of Kilmarnock. The late William Parker, 
Esq. of London, left L. 1000, of which the interest goes to the 
same objects ; and the late William Paterson, Esq. of Ayr, be- 
queathed L. 90 a-year, to be laid out in small aniiuities to decayed 
persons. 

Prisons. — There is no jail in the town, and criminals, after a 
short detention in the police-office, are transmitted to the county 
prison at Ayr. The police buildings, with town offices, were erect- 
ed in 1806; and since then, a police esfablishment has been or- 
ganized, composed of seven or eight officers, very effectively su- 
perintended. In the absence of a sheriff-substitute, the criminal 
cases disposed of are of a comparatively trivial nature ; the fines 
inflicted being appropriated to the support of the establishment. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held in the course of the year; 
one on the second Tuesday of May, for the sale of cattle ; 
another on the last Thursday of July, for horses, black-cattle, and 
wool ; and the third, on the last Thursday of October, for the 
sale of horses. There is, besides, a weekly market held on Friday, 
at which there is a regular supply of cattle, sheep, and pigs, but- 
ter, cheese, and eggs ; and a grain market, recently revived, is 
well attended on the same day by farmers and dealers. 

Inns and Alehouses. — The number of licensed inns and alehouses 
is about 150, and the evidences of intemperance are here, as else- 
where, in our day unhappily but too manifest. There are, however, 
few public-houses of the more degraded sort, common in larger 
towns, and the police are extremely vigilant in preventing them 
from making any undue encroachments upon the Lord's Day.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. THOMAS SMITH WHARRIE, A. M. MINISTER  



I. — Topography and Natdral History. 
Name.— The name of this parish is derived from a person who 
formerly resided here, called Simon Lockhart ; Simon's town or 
Symington. 

Situation.— The village is situated on a gentle eminence near 
the centre of the parish. It commands a fine view of the Frith of 
Clyde, where vessels are seen sailing to and fro. Ailsa Rock is 
seen in the distance, also the fertile plains of Cunningham, with 
numerous enclosures, belts, clumps of planting, and gentlemen's 
seats. These rich and delightful views are bounded on the north, 
by the cloud-capped Benlomond, and adjacent mountains; on the 
west, by the romantic Island of Arran ; and on the south, by the 
high hills near Galloway. 

Boundaries.— This parish is bounded on the north, by Dundo- 
nald parish ; on the east, by Riccarton parish ; on the south, by 
Craigie parish ; and on the west, by the parish of Monkton, and 
IS nearly of a parallelogram figure, being about 4 miles in length, 
and li broad. It contains nearly 5 square miles. 

Geoloff and Mineralogy.— Gvefish and blue whinstone abound 
m this parish, running in beds across the country, at no great dis- 
tance from the surface ; and it is, in some places, above the surface 
to the height of 12 feet. Around the village, plenty of rotten 
rock IS to be had ; but as it is soft, it is not u.ed except for drains. 

Sotl.-The soil throughout the parish is, in general, clayey, on 
a hard subsoil. Around the village, it is of a light dry nature 
lying on a rotten rock. Part of the parish is of a soft loam o 
mossy nature, generally lying on a fine clay bottom. 

Mines.-Fovmev\y, there was a coal-pit in the parish, but now 
It IS given up. There are numerous whinstone quarries in the pa- 
rish, used generally for road metal. Limestone is to be had but 
It does not repay the expense of mining it. Freestone is abundant,

there being a freestone quarry at the east end of the parish, which 
supplies all the neighbourhood with stones for the erection of houses. 
As it lies on the margin of the Glasgow and Portpatrick road, and 
near to Kilmarnock, a great number of stones are used for build- 
ings in that town. It is rather a coarse stone ; finer kinds being 
procured elsewhere for corners, windows, &amp;c. 

Springs. — Plenty of good spring water is to be found in this pa- 
rish, where the inhabitants have dug wells that afford a supply even 
in the severest drought. 

Plantations. — There are no natural forests in this parish ; and 
the plantations consist mostly of clumps or belts. The proprietor 
of Dankeith, about the year 1740, planted several belts and clumps 
of planting on his property, dressed a few of his fields with com- 
post, and was among the first who introduced rye-grass into Ayr- 
shire. About the year 1770, Dr Fullerton of Rosemount, on his 
return from India, rebuilt the mansion-house at Rosemount in a 
modern style, cultivated his land, and tastefully ornamented the 
grounds with belts of planting, giving employment to a great num- 
ber of poor families. 

II. — Civil History. 
Land-Owners.— Thee are. Lieutenant- Colonel William Kelso 
of Dankeith ; Lady Mary Montgomerie, who is patroness ; George

field ; the Honourable David Boyle, Lord Justice-Clerk ; Robert 
Rankin, Esq. of Muirhouse ; James Campbell, Esq. of Craigie ;

Parochial Beffisters.— These have been kept so far back as the 
year 1642, but very irregularly till about 1780. 

Antiquities.— Tins parish can scarcely boast of any antiquities. 
Formerly, there was a round mound called the Law-hill, at the foot 
of the village, partly natural and partly artificial, when the proprietor, 
Mr Boyd, in improving his land, caused the Law-hill to be levelled 
with the adjacent field. Those employed in doing so, found at no 
great depth from the surface, several arrow-heads, made of iron, 
most of them barbed and very rudely constructed. They also 
found combs made of horn, in a pretty good state of preservation. 
These are in the possession of William H. Boyd of Townend, and 
the Rev. Mr Wharrie. There is also an eminence near Helenton,

called the Mote-hill, upon which a ruin stands ; but of which tradi- 
tion takes no notice. 

Modern Buildings. — These are Williamfield House, which was 
erected about eight years ago by Mrs Fairlie of Williamfield; its erec- 
tion and the surrounding improvements cost upwards of L. 20,000. 
A large conservatory is at one end of the house, in which is a 
large collection of rare and valuable plants ; and in front of the 
house, there is an artificial lake, more than a quarter of a mile in 
length, in which there is an island planted with trees and shrubs. 
Water-fowls are seen swimming in abundance, both wild and do- 
mesticated. Townend House is beautifully situated on an emi- 
nence. It is built of dressed whin rock, with hewn freestone corners, 
&amp;c. which has a beautiful effect. Dankeith and Rosemount 
houses are of an older date, very commodious, finely situated, and 
surrounded with thriving plantations, &amp;c.

Number of acres in the parish, - 3660 
in plantations, about 30 

The remainder is nearly all arable land, and under cultivation. 

Woods. — The forest trees in this parish are mostly ash, alder, 
beech, birch, elm, larch, silver, spruce, and Scotch firs, besides 
oak, some of which are of a large size. All of them have been 
planted, and are in general kept in pretty good order. 

Rent. — The average rent of land in this parish is about L. 1, 15s. 
for the imperial acre ; but some of the land around the village 
lets as high as L. 3, 12s. per imperial acre. Cows are grazed 
during summer for about L. 3 each ; sheep at about L. 1 each, dur- 
ing both summer and winter. 

Live-Stock. — The common breed of cattle for the dairy is of the 
Ayrshire kind. There are 400 dairy cows kept in the parish, besides 
121 young' cattle. The draught horses are mostly of the Clydes- 
dale breed. There are about 90 employed for agricultural pur- 
poses, besides 14 young horses. There are about 41 horses used 
for harness and the saddle. The breed of swine is various. About 
92 swine are at present in the parish. Many of the cottars dojiot 
think themselves comfortable without having pork of their own 
feeding. There are 550 sheep in the parish, of the Cheviot, Lei- 
cester, and black-faced breed. 

Improvements, Sc. — Within these few years, the land in this pa- 
rish has been greatly improved by furrow-draining, which has 
greatly increased the bulk of crops. 

The ereneral duration of leases is from sixteen to nineteen vears. 

The farm-steadings, in general, are very good, being built of 
stones and lime. The roofs are covered with oat straw, and a 
number of them are slated. 

Quarries. — There is a freestone quarry in the east end of the 
parish, called Spittlehill, the materials of which are used for erect- 
ing houses. The stones are raised by iron levers, wedges, and 
mells. There are several whinstone quarries in the parish, the ma- 
terials of which are raised for road metal, &amp;c.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Markets. — Kilmarnock, at the distance of five miles from the 
village, is the nearest market-town. 

Means of Communication. — A penny post-office is established in 
the village, where letters are received daily from Kilmarnock and 
Ayr. The Glasgow and Portpatrick road runs through the whole 
length of the parish, nearly four miles, on which run daily five 
stage-coaches, the Glasgow and Portpatrick mail-coaches, besides a 
great number of carriers' waggons, &amp;c. 

Thorn is chiefly used for fences : but there is sometimes a mix- 
ture of thorn, beech, and privets. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated near the cen- 
tre of the parish, being about two miles distant from its farthest 
extremity. At what time it was built, is uncertain. It received an 
addition in 1797, when the whole underwent a sufficient repair. It 
can accommodate with ease 400 people. There are thirty or forty 
free sittings in the church. 

The manse was built about the year 1 786, and re-slated in 1838. 
The stipend consists of 120 bolls of oatmeal, and 120 bolls of bar- 
ley, Linlithgow measure, payable by the fiar prices of the county, 
besides L. 22, Is. in money, and L.8, 6s. 8d. for communion ele- 
ments. The glebe contains about five imperial acres, and may be 
worth about L. 15 per annum. 

There is a Dissenting meeting held once a fortnight in a gar- 
ret room ; but there are not above five or six Dissenting fami- 
lies in the parish. Divine service is generally well attended by 
all ranks of people. The number of communicants are about 240, 
not including strangers who join in that ordinance. 

The church collections for the poor average about L. 26 a year. 

Education. — The parochial school is the only one in the parish, 
where from seventy to eighty children are taught Enghsh gram- 
mar, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, French, &amp;c. The salary 
of the schoolmaster is L. 34, 5s. lOd. The school fees may ave- 
rage about L. 40 a year. The schoolmaster has a dwelling-house, 
school-room, and garden. 

Poof and Parochial Funds. — About eight poor people receive 
monthly 5s. each, besides having their house rents paid out of the 
poor's fund. A considerable number also receive assistance, who

are not on the monthly roll of paupers. The annual amount of 
collections made at the church for behoof of the poor, is about 
L. 26 : the poor have also the interest of L. 100, left by the late 
Mrs Fullerton of Rosemount. 

When the funds for the support of the poor have been expend- 
ed, the heritors voluntarily subscribe, according to their respective 
valuations, for what may be required for that purpose. 

Inns, Sfc. — There are six houses in the parish where spirits and 
ales are sold; three of these are in the village, the other three are 
on the Glasgow and Portpatrick road, where the stage-coaches 
and mails change horses. 

FueL~Co&amp;\ is the only kind of fuel used in this parish: it is 
procured from Fairlie, Gatehead, and Caprington coal-pits, in the 
adjoining parishes of Dundonald and Riccarton.

<p>

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. GEORGE COLVILLE, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name. — The name of the parish, according to Chalmers, is 
Celtic, signifying birch. There is reason to believe that the whole 
of the district was once covered with wood. Many names of places 
indicate their derivation from this circumstance, as WoodsidCi 
Threepwood, Fulwoodhead, Roughioood, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Extent, Boundaries, c. — The town lies in latitude 55° 47' 
north, and in longitude 4° 39' west. It consisted, at the beginning 
of the seventeenth century, of a few houses set down at the kirk, 
but now contains upwards of 300. The parish lies in the form of 
a triangle. Its greatest length is from south-east to south-west, 
which is 4 miles. A small part of it, in the south-east, lies in 
Renfrewshire, having been disjoined from Neilston and annexed 
to Beith. This was done about 1649, at which time the bounds 
of the different presbyteries in the synod of Glasgow wei«e care- 
fully perambulated, with the view of forming new parishes where 
required, and of annexing or disjoining lands, to suit the conve- 

 This Account lias been furnished by James Dobic, Esq. of Crummock. 



BEITH. 



571 



nience of the people. The parish contains 11,060 acres Scots 
measure, of which 600 are in Renfrewshire. It is bounded on the 
north, by the parish of Lochwinnoch; on the east, by Neilston and 
Dunlop; on the south, by Kilwinning and Dairy; and on the west, 
by Kilbirnie Loch. 

Topographical Appearance.— The surface is slightly undulated 
throughout, and consequently does not present the varied features 
of hill and dale, nor any of the picturesque beauties generally to 
be met with in districts of a more broken and diversified aspect. 
The highest land is in the north-east quarter of the parish, from 
which it gently slopes to the west and south-west, and the least 
elevated portion of it is that bounded by Kilbirnie Loch. The 
parish may be said to occupy the eastern summit of the land 
bounding the valley, which extends between the River Clyde and 
the coast of Ayrshire. Along this strath a stream runs from Kil- 
birnie Loch northward, through Lochwinnoch to the Clyde, and 
the Garnock, after approaching within half a mile of Kilbirnie 
Loch, turns to the south and falls into the sea at Irvine. It is 
through this valley that the Ardrossan Canal was to have been 
formed ; and, as Kilbirnie Loch was its summit level, and being 
only about ninety feet above the sea, the line presented great faci- 
lities for such an undertaking. In 1805, an act of Parliament was 
passed, authorizing the canal to be made; but this undertaking 
having proved far more expensive than had been anticipated, was 
completed only between Glasgow and Johnstone. In 1825, an 
act was passed to form a railway in its stead ; but this was not done; 
and, in 1837, an act was passed for forming a great line of railway 
through the same valley, from Glasgow by Paisley and Irvine to 
Ayr, witha branch to Kilmarnock,— which undertakinghas recently 
been commenced. It has been proposed to form a line of railway 
from Kilmarnock, by Cumnock, Dumfries, and Carlisle, to join 
the Liverpool railway at Preston, which, if carried into effect, would 
make this the great line of communication from London to Glas- 
gow and the west coast. As already stated, the lowest elevation 
of the parish is about 90 feet ; its highest is on Cuff Hill, which 
is 652 feet. From this hill, which will be more particularly no- 
ticed afterwards, and from several of the adjoining uplands, the 
prospect is unrivalled in the 'district for extent, variety, and mag- 
nificence. To the south and west are visible the mountain ranges 
of Galloway and Carrick, the spacious estuary of the Clyde, the 
Craig of Ailsa, and the lofty peaks of Arran ; while, northward the

horizon is bounded by the serrated ridges of Cowal and the wavy 
outline of the far receding hills of Perthshire, in advance of which iii 
proud pre-eminence, stands Ben Lomond, the monarch of the scene 
The scenery inclosed by so noble a frame-work, especially when its 
varied features are boldly relieved by the rays of the declining sun 
IS well calculated to gladden the eye and exhilarate the heart of 
the spectator. It may not inaptly be briefly characterized in more 
appropriate terms, than we can command, as being composed of 

" Hills and dales, and woods and lawns and spires 
And glittering towns, and gilded streams." 

There are within the parish twenty-four miles of turnpike and 
forty miles of parish roads, which occupy 2'24 acres; and there 
are four corn and four lint-mills within its bounds. The parish 
was accurately surveyed by Mr Robert Aitken, land-surveyor, 
Beith, who, in 1829, published an atlas of the different parishes 
in Cunninghame. 

Hijdrography.~ThQ river Lugton takes its rise from Lochlibo, 
and runs south-west through the parish for about three miles, and, 
after passing through the parish of Kilwinning, joins the Garnock 
below Eglinton Castle. The Dusk rises at Threepwood, and falls 
into the Garnock at Dalgarvan, below Dairy. There are no other 
streams in the parish which merit particular notice. At Blaeloch- 
head there is a small lake, which is thus noticed by Pont, the early 
topographer of Cunninghame : " Blaa Loche, ed est, lacuspalli- 
dus, so named because qwhen the firmament is most serene and 
cleir then is it palide and dead-coloured, contrair to all other in- 
corrupt and sueit vatters." This loch has been partially drained. 
There was in the days of Pont a lake in front of Hazlehead Cas- 
tle, but this has been entirely drained, so has the loch of Boghall, 
as will be more particularly noticed afterwards. 

Geology and Miner alogy.— 'o granite nor other primitive rock 
has been found in this parish. The greatest portion of it is formed 
of what is sometimes called the great coal formation, and by Wer- 
ner, the independent coal formation, and is classed by several au- 
thors as constituting the upper series of the transition or interme- 
diate rocks. A considerable extent consists of trap rocks, especi- 
ally on the west and south-west parts of the parish ; and in some 
places, they rise into considerable hills. 

The coal measures extend along the whole of the west boun- 
dary of the parish, for some miles to the south. On the east part 
of the boundary, on the estate of Woodside, William Patrick, Esq. 
the proprietor of that estate, has found extensive beds of limestone, 



BEITH. 



573 



and he has also there found good brick clay, and established a 
manufactory of draining tiles. To the west of this estate, there 
are appearances of coal in the lands of Willowyard, belonging to 
Alexander Shedden, Esq. ; and in the adjoining lands of Crawfield, 
belonging to Lady Montgomerie, a three and a half feet coal has 
been discovered by boring, and is now being wrought. The only 
other coal known in the parish was, for some years, wrought at 
Balgray, but has been relinquished on account of its rapid dip and 
rise. 

From Kilbirnie loch southward, the surface rises, in the distance 
of about two miles, to an elevation of 330 feet above the tideway 
on the Clyde. The surface is somewhat undulatory and irregular, 
and so are the strata underneath, so far as they have been exposed ; 
but the changes in the surface do not correspond to those of the 
stratification below, the dip of the strata being in general to the 
south-west. 

At a mean elevation of about 330 feet, an extensive field of 
limestone occupies, with very few interruptions, several square miles 
in extent. This limestone has been wrought extensively for many 
years in the lands of Broadstone, belonging to Hugh Brown, Esq. 
and in those of Hazlehead, Trearne, and Broadstone, belonging to 
John Shedden Patrick, Esq, and it is of such good quality, and 
wrought with so great facility, that the sale extends to Paisley, 
Greenock, and other places equally distant, and amounts to about 
7000 chalders yearly, each chalder consisting of sixteen bolls of 
slacked lime, of four Winchester bushels per boll. The formation 
of the Glasgow and Ayr railroad must extend the sales both to the 
east and west. 

Thelimestone, whichhas usuallybeen wrought, varies from 18to20 
feet in thickness, and rests upon a coal of 20 inches, separated from 
the limestone by a few inches of shale. In many places, this bed of 
limestone approaches thesurface, and is wrought with small expense; 
to the dip it is overlaid by or taices on, as the miners express it, in 
succession, the following strata : 1st, Shale, 2 feet; 2d,. Coal, 1 foot, 
I inch ; 3d, Clay, containing a thin bed of hmestone, 6 feet; 4th, A 
large body of limestone, of various thickness, from 12 to upwards of 
50 feet, and rising into considerable hills. The price of lime at 
the kilns varies from 9s. to 12s. per chalder, and may average 
about 10s. 6d. To burn a chalder of lime will require about 12 
hundred weight of coals, which, including the cartage, will cost 
between 5s. and 6s. per chalder. The quarrying and breaking

the stones, leading them to the kiln-head, and filling the kiln, will 
cost about 3s. d. per chakler, and the lordship or rent to the 
proprietor of the lime rock is about Is. per chalder, so that the 
profit to the tacksmen is very small. Eight bolls of lime -shells are 
sold at the kiln as a chalder of lime, and will form two good cart- 
loads. The 8 bolls of shells, if well burned, will "produce 20 bolls 
of slacked lime, so that the 8 bolls of shells are better than 16 
bolls of slacked lime. The whole of this important field of lime 
rock is of the best quality, and is found on analysis to contain 
from 90 to 95 per cent, of pure carbonate of lime. It consists 
chiefly of organic remains, the upper portions being almost en- 
tirely composed of encrinites, with a mixture of bivalve shells. 
The whole is sufficiently hard to receive a high polish as marble, 
and has been wrought into chimney-pieces, tables, &amp;c. to a conside- 
rable extent. The field of limestone crops out on the north, for about 
two miles, along the south bank of the Powgree-burn, which se- 
parates the baronies of Broadstone and Hazlehead from the ba- 
rony of Beith, and it appears near Giffen Castle, and in various 
other places for some miles to the southward, and may afford for 
ages to come a plentiful supply both for agricultural and architec- 
tural purposes to the whole country, extending from Glasgow to 
the west coast. 

Below this limestone is a body of white clay, into which bores 
have been inserted in several places, one of them to the depth of 
•27 fathoms, without discovering any change of material. 

Clay ironstone, a mineral of great importance, especially 
when associated with coal and limestone, has been found in va- 
rious parts of the parish, from the north to the south extremity, 
particularly along the banks of the waters of Dusk and Povvgree, 
and appears to exist in great abundance. 

On the lands of Duskrigg and Laverock Hall, the property of 
John S. Patrick Esq. and, on the lands of Roughwood, and other 
contiguous lands belonging to William Patrick, Esq. and on the 
lands of Craighouse, belonging to Robert Montgomerie, Esq., va- 
rious beds of ironstone, favourably situated for being wrought, 
have been discovered ; one on the bank of the Dusk is 18 inches 
in thickness, and another 4 inches, the two beds being almost in 
contact. On the Powgree burn, a bed of 8 inches, and another 
of 6 inches, are favourably situated for being wrought. Many 
others, and various strata containing nodules of iron-ore, exist m 
other localities, some of which yield, upon analysis, 30 per cent, of

pure iron. Tlie average of the whole specimens collected, amount- 
ing to upwards of twenty in number, as analysed by Dr Fyfe of 
Edinburgh, was found to yield nearly 29 per cent, of iron, being 
somewhat more than is afforded by the analysis of the South 
Wales ironstone, as reported in the Transactions of the Natural 
History Society of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. 

Freestone is also found in the parish, and a freestone pavement 
quarry is wrought in the lands of Willowyard, near the line of the 
Glasgow and Ayr Railway. 

The trap rocks, comprehending whinstone and basaltic dikes, 
which in some places rise above the surface, afford excellent ma- 
terials for keeping the public roads in repair. There are several 
dikes of basalt which run across the whole strata, in the line of 
dip, being from south-east to north-west. 

Climate, c. — The prevailing winds are from the south-west 
and north-east, which bring heavy rains. The people are on the 
whole as healthy as in any other parish in the district. In the 
mortality bills between 1825 and 1833, there were several persons 
in each year, except in 1830, who died between 85 and 90. In 
the same period, there were 7 between 00 and 95, and 7 above 95. 

This place was twice visited by the cholera. In 1831, when the 
disease made its appearance at Sunderland, and was making pro- 
gress to the north, a board of health was instituted here, and all 
sanatory means adopted which skill and prudence could suggest. 
In the summer of 1832, four fatal cases occurred, and it was with 
difficulty people could be persuaded to attend the funerals. This 
visitation passed over thus slightly, but in 1834 it was most severe. 
The first death occurred on 5th September, and until 20th Oc- 
tober, the disease raged with fearful sway. There were 208 cases, 
and 105 deaths, some of which were awfully sudden. The minds 
of the people became more composed than on the previous occa- 
sion, and the funerals were conducted with the usual decorum. 
Liberal subscriptions in aid of the sufferers were made, and much 
sympathy evinced towards those who were so unexpectedly bereav- 
ed of their parents and relatives. 

Botany. — This parish is rich in its vegetable productions as well 
as in its mineral, and cannot fail to be interesting to the botanist. 
A great variety of plants are to be found within a small compass. 

 This department has been furnished by James Adam, Esq. W. S., and that on 
Botany, by Alexander Spiers, Esq. Surgeon in Beith.

This is chiefly owing to the sudden elevation of the ground : the 
lowest part of the parish being only 95 feet above the level of the sea, 
while the highest is 652, being a difference of 557 feet in the short 
distance of two miles and a half, — thus presenting a diversified sur- 
face, and a variety of soil and climate, giving origin to numerous 
genera and species. The following list, beginning at the lowest 
part of the parish, enumerates the rarest of the plants.

There is, generally speaking, a want of ornamental trees and of 
plantations in this parish. Some exceptions, however, must be 
made to this general remark. Caldwell House is situated in a large 
park, richly clothed with wood, and many of the trees are of great 
size and beauty. Hazlehead presents several avenues of fine old 
beeches, and on some other places of Mr S. Patrick's property 
there are young thriving plantations. Mr Pratt of Brown Muir 
planted, about four years ago, Brown Muir Hill, consisting of from 
twenty to thirty Scotch acres, which, a few years hence, will add 
greatly to the beauty of the parish. 

II.— Civil History. 

Antiquities, c. — Of old, the parish consisted of two grand di- 
visions, the Barony of Beith, and the Lordship of Giffen, of which 
the lordship of Giffen was the most extensive. They are divid- 
ed by the stream called the Powgree, which falls into the Garnock 
near the west end of Kilbirnie Loch. The barony of Beith was 
gifted by Richard de Moreville, the son and successor of Hugh de 
Moreville, constable of Scotland, and Lord of Cunningham, to the 
Abbey of Kilwinning. Avicia de Lancaster, the wife of Richard de 
Moreville, gave the lands of Beith, Bath, and Threepwood to the 
monastery, in pur am et perpetuam elecsmosi/7iam, and though

the grant cannot be ascertained, it must have been prior to 1189

Long prior to these dates, Beith was the occasional residence 

0 bt Inan, a confessor of some celebrity, whose principal place 
of abode was at Irvme. He flourished about 839. On the Cuff 
.HI Z there is a cleft in the rock, which is 
still called St Inan's Chau-; and at a short distance from it, a well 
of excellent water called St Inan's Well. From the Callendar of 
SCO s Samts, we find that the festival of this saint was celebrated 
on the 18th of August ; and to this day, there is a fair at Beith 
held on the corresponding day, old style. Tradition still bears 
tha this fair used to be held on the Cuff Hill. It was removed to 
Beith afer the town had increased in population, and became a 
more suitable place for a market. It is one of the principal fairs 
in the county The fair is vulgarly pronounced Tenant's Day • 
but this IS evident y a corruption arising from the final letter of 
bamt, being sounded with the name Inan. Similar corruptions 
occur m Tantony, which is a corruption of St Antony: and Tau 
drey which is a corruption of St Audrey. It is worthy of notice" 

hat this corruption, and the fact of the celebration of St Inan's 
fes ival at Beith, have been overlooked by the learned author of

But the Cuff Hill has antiquities much earlier than the days of 
St Inan On the north declivity of the hill, there is a rockinl 
stone of considerable size, which can be set in motion by the 
slightest touch.  "®

At the bottom of the hill, north of the rocking-stone, there are the 
remains of a circular trench, and of some building. The place is 
called KiMie Green. On a plain at the south bottom of the hill, 
about twenty-five years ago, were discovered several stone coffinsun- 
der a large cairn of stones. The total length of the cairn is 72 feet ; 
its breadth 36 feet ; its height 10 feet. In one of them were 
found some fragments of human bones, with a small bead of burned 
clay, and a piece of copper like a defaced coin; but there was no 
appearance of the urn. The usual indication of Christian burial 
was wanting, as the coffins did not lie east and west. The cairn 
which contained these coffins, and a considerable part of which is 
still left entire, has been enclosed and surrounded with a planta- 
tion by Dr Robert Patrick of Hazlehead, the late proprietor. On 
a field in the adjoining lands of Townend of Threepwood, about 
thirty-five years ago, there was found a large vase of burned clay, 
of a size capable of containing about six gallons. In it there was 
a considerable quantity of burned bones. The vase broke on 
being handled and exposed to the air, and soon crumbled into 
dust Within it there was found a small open urn of hard burned 
clay and at a short distance from it, another small urn was found 
bv itself; probably the larger one in which this last had been 
placed was destroyed without being noticed. They indicated no 
knowledge of art, and seemed as if formed with the finger and 
thumb. The small urns were doubtless for receiving the ashes ot 
the brain and heart, while those of the body were lodged in the 
larger vessel. In one of them were two perforations, as it tor hx- 
ing it to some other body; probably to the larger urn, in wbch it 
was found, or for receiving wires for its own lid or cover. These 
are antiquities, which, as Sir Thomas Brown says. Time anti- 
quates; for we have no floating tradition as to their origin on this 

hill or its vicinity. , , ca 

The two modes of sepulture here exemplified, the stone coffin 
in one place, and the cinereal urn in another, probably md.cate 
different ages; and the one first used may have been as much 
untrn to'thLse who adopted the last as both are to oursel.es 

Some are ot opinion that these funereal remams prove hat a 
battle was fought on this spot, and that the tumuh con.am the r-e- 
mains ot t r chiefs who fell in the conflict. The, is a h,ll at a ht le 
ce Lthwards, called Gillies Hill, and this .s suppose o be 
the place where the followers of the army appeared. We know 
at it was common in the warfare of such remote penods, for the

women and children to be placed in the rear, and to use every 
method in their power to encourage those engaged in the combat; 
but this notion of a battle is purely fanciful, and who fought, fell, 
fled, or conquered at this " famous victory," must remain for ever 
undescribed by poet or historian. But if we view this hill as a 
seat of Druidism, we have a dawning of light. Dr Jamieson is of 
opmion that Druidism was not extinct in Scotland in the age of 
Columba, 563-597, and there is reason for believing that it was 
restored by the Saxons, after it had been abolished by the Roman 
emperors. If so, it must have been- the religion of this part of 
the country, a short time previous to the age of St Inan. Holding 
this hill as a seat of Druidism, we have a corroborative testimony 
in the etymology of the name. It is called Cuff Hill. Now we 
learn from Bede, that the chief-priest of the Druids was called 
Cotyi, Cuifi, or Cuivl Either of these names can be easily cor- 
rupted into Cuffi or Cuff, and thus the hill may have received its 
appellation from being the seat of the Druidical worship. Besides, 
the word Ciffoeth, in the ancient British language, signifies the 
Holy Place, " Cor Kyveoth," which is pronounced Cuffoetk, is 
the name of Stonehenge in that language. This opinion is sup- 
ported by that of Dr Macpherson, in his Critical Dissertations, 
who thmks Coiji was the common title of every Druidical superin- 
tendant of spiritual affairs. It is naw stated as a plausible guess 
at the origin of the name of the hill. There are other places of 
similar name, and which probably had the same origin. Thus, in 
the Acta Dominorum Concilii, under date 6th March 1491, there 
is a case, where Gilbert Kennedy of the Coiffx, defender, and Fer- 
gus Kennedy of Cardonald is pursuer ; and, in Pitcairn's Trials, 
Thomas Kennedy of Coiff, is one of a long list of that name, di- 
lated of a cruel slaughter in 1528. These places are in different 
parts of the country, and are noticed only as tracing the corruption 
of the word CoiJi, which is not so marked as the substitution of 
Tenant for St Inan. 

On the lands of Hill of Beith, there is one of those moothills on 
which our ancestors received the award of their judges. We have 
good evidence of such places being used as the seat of legislation 
as well as judicature, but when the custom ceased, it is difficult 
to say, for, like many other customs, it disappeared gradually, 
and the change is not noticed by historians. The moothill of 
Beith being in a barony belonging to the church, was of course 
the place of judgment from which the Abbot of Kilwinning ad- 



580 



AYRSHIRE. 



ministered justice to his vassals and tenants. The hill itself is 
smaller than others in the district. There is a finer specimen at 
the town of Dairy, which is still denominated the Courthill, and 
there is another near the mansion-house of Lainshaw. The lands 
on which the one in Beith stands, are, from this circumstance, call- 
ed the hill of Beith. They were early feued"by the Abbot of 
Kilwinning, and for several generations belonged to a branch of 
the family of the Cunninghames, the same being sometimes de- 
signated of Hill, and sometimes of" Hill of Beith." The residence 
of the Cunninghames was a square tower which stood not far from 
the moothill. It was removed about the middle of the last cen- 
tury. In Font's Cunninghame Typographized, it is styled a "pretty 
building, veill planted, belonging to John Cunninghame." It is 
now the property of Hugh Brown, Esq. of Broadstone. 

Adjoining these lands is the farm of Boghall, which affords another 
article in the antiquities of this parish. In the map of Cunning- 
hame in Blau's Atlas, published in 1 654, there is laid down a piece 
of water called the Loch of Boghall. This loch belonged to the 
Monastery of Kilwinning, and was of old called Loch Brand. In 
the Acta Dominorum Concilii, there is mention made of a case, 10th 
December 1482, at the instance of the Abbot and Convent of Kil- 
winning against Robert Montgomery, son and heir to umquhile 
Robert Montgomery of Giffen, Knight, John Montgomery, his 
brother, Alexander Montgomery, William Montgomery and 
James Kerr, who were accused of the dangerous destruction, and 
down-casting of the fosses and dikes of the loch called Loch 
Brand. The cause was continued, but the record does not state 
what was the result. The Abbot of Kilwinning here mentioned 
must have been William Boyd, second son of Sir Thomas Boyd, 
of Kilmarnock, by Joannah Montgomery, daughter of Sir John 
Montgomery of Ardrossan. The lands of Boghall passed from 
the Montgomerys of Braidstane about 150 years ago. The loch 
was drained about 60 years ago, when firm stakes of oak and elm 
were found in the soil, and which had been used for fixing the nets 
for fishing. 

In the map of Cunninghame in Blau's Atlas, already mentioned, 
there is exhibited a cross on the northern boundary of the barony 
of Beith. The lands adjoining to the barony of Beith on the 
east and north belonged to the Abbacy of Paisley, and lay in the 
county of Renfrew, so that the cross was probably fixed as the 
boundary by consent of both of these religious houses. Their 



BEITH. 



581 



estates were divided by a stream called Muirbiirn, which falls into 
the loch of Lochwinnoch to the eastward of Kilbirnie loch. Crosses 
were at an early period used in marking the boundaries of lord- 
ships and parishes, or lands given to -monasteries. These were 
sometimes framed of wood, but were more commonly of stone, as 
bemg more durable, and less easy of being removed. Crosses for 
landmarks are mentioned as early as 528, and afterwards became 
common. Kings and lords used them as tokens of dominion, and 
they were special landmarks of the templars and hospitalers. 
The form of the cross was used that no man for conscience sake 
should remove them. As already mentioned, the barony of Beith 
was the property of the monastery of Kilwinning, and was the 
largest and most valuable of their possessions ; and as the north- 
ern mark was not only the boundary of their property, but that of 
the parish and county, the cross must have been a serviceable 
landmark. Of its existence, there is now no trace, nor is its his- 
tory or fite remembered in the floating annals of tradition. 

In the barony of Giffen we have antiquities of another kind. 
One of the most powerful of the English families which settled 
in Scotland during the reign of David L, was that of De Moreville. 
The first of them was Hugh, to whom the King made a grant of 
the whole lands of Cunninghame, and created him constable of 
Scotland, which office remained with his descendants for some ge- 
nerations. In the reign of William the Lion, the family of the 
De Morevilles gave the lands or lordship of Giffeyn to Walter De 
Mulcaster. This lordship comprehended the whole of that part 
of the parish which lies to the south and westward of the stream 
called the Powgree, and forms fully one-half in extent and value 
of the present parish. The rest of the parish consists of the ba-- 
rony of Beith, which, as before-mentioned, -was given by the De 
Morevilles to the monastery of Kilwinning. Giffen was given by 
Walter De Mulcaster to Alexander De Nenham as his subvassal 
He granted to the monastery of Dryburgh a half caracute or 50 
acres of land in the lordship of Gilfen, at which a chapel to St 
Bridget had previously been founded by the monastery of Kilwin- 
ning, the ruins of which still exist, situated on a hill which had 
been used as a burying-ground, with an uncommonly fine sprino- 
well, called St Bridget's Well, at the bottom. The chapel mult 
have fallen to ruins about the Reformation. This grant was part 
of the lands of Trearne, and was so minutely described by its na 
tural boundaries, that the marches can still be traced. The mor-

tification was for the benefit of the souls of Richard De Moreville, 
WiUiam De Moreville, Holland of Galloway, and Elene De Mo- 
reville, his spouse. It was confirmed by Walter De Mulcaster 
the over lord, and his chaiter was also ratified by Allan, son of 
.Holland, Constable of Scotland. The charter is in the Chartu- 
lary of Dryburgh. It bears no date, as was customary in those 
days ; but from the names of the parties, it must have been grant- 
ed between 1209 and 1223. The lands of Trearne now belong to 
Mr Patrick of Hazlehead. About this period the lands of Rough- 
wood, being a sub-barony of GifFen, belonged to a very ancient fa- 
mily of the name of Hammill, which is nov represented by Robert 
Montgomery of Craighouse, through female descent. 

The daughter and heiress of Richard De Moreville was mar- 
ried to RoUand, Lord of Galloway. Their son Allan, Lord of 
Galloway, succeeded to the estates of the De Morevilles, and be- 
came thus Lord of Cunninghame and Constable of Scotland. He 
had several daughters, but no son, and his estates were divided 
among his daughters. One of them was married to John Baliol ; 
another to an English nobleman of the name of De laZouche, and 
another to one of the Comyns. These families having all taken 
part with their near relation, John Baliol, in the contest with 
Bruce for the throne, their estates were forfeited by Bruce, and di- 
vided among his own followers, as the Stewarts, Flemings, Boyds 
Sempills, &amp;c. In this way, the estate of GifFen reverted to the 
Crown. In 1370, the first year of the reign of Robert II., a char- 
ter passed under the Great Seal, bestowing the lands of GifFen on 
Sir Hugh De Eglinton, who was married to Egedia, sister of the 
King, and widow of Sir James Lindsay of Crawford. Sir Hugh 
possessed great influence at court, and held several important 
offices. In 1361, he was Justiciary of Lothian, and in 1367, was 
appointed one of the Commissioners for a treaty with England. He 
left an only daughter, Elizabeth, who married John Montgomery 
of Eaglesham, whose descendants became Earls of Egtinton. The 
estate of GifFen remained with this potent family for several centu- 
ries, being given as the messuage of the heir-apparent or master of 
Eglinton. It appears that, in 1452, John De Lyddale had right 
to the lands of Braidstane, a sub barony of Giffen, but the right had 
reverted to the family of Eglinton, as about that time Braidstane 
and the lands of Hazlehead, another sub-barony of GifFen, were 
given ofF to younger sons of the Earl of Eglinton, and formed two 
distinct families, which continued to hold their respective proper-

ties for several generations, and produced some distinguished men, 
whose history might form an interesting narrative. Another part 
of the lordship of Giffen was about the same period granted to the 
family of Mure of Caldwell, and forms that part of their estate si- 
tuated in the parish of Beith. The lands of Roughwood, which 
had been granted to the family of Hammill in the time of the De 
Morevilles, still belonged to them, and were retained by them until 
1690, when they were acquired by Robert Shedden, merchant in 
Beith. They now belong to William Patrick, Esq. In 1663, 
Alexander, sixth Earl of Eglinton, broke up the estate of Giffen, 
and feued out the greater part of it in farms. The portion which 
remained was the estate of Francis Montgomerie, second son of 
Earl Alexander. He was a leading person in the political transac- 
tions of his time, having sat as one of the represenlfatives of Ayr- 
shire in several Scottish Parliaments. He was one of the Commis- 
sioners for the Union with England, and was active and zealous in 
promoting that measure, and was member for Ayrshire in the first 
British Parliament after the Union in 1708.' His son, John Mont- 
gomerie, was member for Ayrshire in four successive Parliaments 
between 1710 and 1722. He was an officer of the Guards, and 
afterwards Governor of New York, where he died. He married a 
daughter of the Earl of Hyndford, but left no issue. Being of ex- 
pensive habits, he contracted debt, for the liquidation of which the 
remainder of this fine estate was sold. The Castle of Giffen be- 
ing a square tower of 40 feet in height, stood on an eminence of 
180 feet above the adjoining valley, and was long a conspicuous 
landmark to the district. It fell on 12th April 1838.

of these there are only 4 who have upwards of L. 200 Scots, viz. 
J. S. Patrick of Trearne and Hazlehead ; William Mure of Cald- 
well ; William Patrick of Roughwood and Woodside, and Lady 
Montgomery. There are 6 heritors whose valued rent is under 
L. 200, and not under L. 100 Scots; 22 under L. 100, and not 
under h.bb; 21 under L, 50, and not under L. 30 j 21 under

valued rent is under L. 5 Scots. This last list consists chiefly of 
the feuars of the old glebe, on whom the valued rent of the farm 
of Mainshill was apportioned when it was exchanged for the glebe. 
Within the last thirty years, one-half of the whole lands of the 
parish has changed owners. 

Family of Mure of Caldwell— The most ancient family in the pa- 
rish is that of the Mures of Caldwell. They are immediately descend- 
ed from Sir Reginald More or Mure of Abercorn, who was Lord 
High Chamberlain of Scotland in 1329. Gilchrist, second son of 
Sir Reginald, acquired the estate of Caldwell by marrying the heir- 
ess of Caldwell of that ilk. His son John is the first of the name who 
appears designed " of Caldwell" in 1409. A younger branch of the 
male line of Caldwell of that ilk retained possession of a portion of 
the estate called Wester or Little Caldwell, and continued to be a 
respectable Renfrewshire family, until about the end of the se- 
venteenth century, when it failed in the person of John Caldwell, 
who was one of the Commissioners for Renfrewshire to the Scot- 
tish Parliament after the Revolution. The estate passed to the 
Earl of Dundonald, afterwards to the Duke of Hamilton, from 
whom it was purchased by Baron Mure, and now forms part of 
the Caldwell property. In 1655, William Mure of Caldwell 
married Barbara, daughter of Sir William Cunninghame of Cun- 
ninghamhead. In 1666, he and some other gentlemen of the 
neighbourhood, having met at Shitterflat in this parish, resolved 
to aid the people in the cause of civil and religious liberty, and 
formed a troop of horse which marched under the command of the 
Laird of Caldwell, to join the Covenanters. Intelligence having 
been received that the Whigs had been defeated at Pentland, this 
company dispersed. For this patriotic act the Laird of Caldwell 
was attainted, fled to Holland and died in exile. His estates were 
forfeited and bestowed on General Dalziel. His lady and eldest 
daughter were imprisoned in Blackness, and subjected to great 
sufferings and privations, as detailed by Wodrow and other his- 
torians of the times. After the Revolution the estate was restor- 
ed to the eldest surviving daughter, who married John Fairlie of 
that Ilk, but she having died without issue, was succeeded by her 
cousin, William Mure of Glanderston, the heir-male of the family. 
He was succeeded by his nephew, of whom the present owner, 

William Mure, Esq. is the lineal descendant. Mr Mure married 

'1 



BEITH. 



585 



in 1825, Laura, second daughter of William Markham, Esq. of 
Becca Hall, and grand-daughter of Dr William Markham, Arch- 
bishop of York. The mansion-house of Caldwell is a large and 
commodious building. It was designed by the celebrated archi- 
tect Adam, and is placed in an angle of the parish ofBeith, being 
part of the feu from the lordship of Giffen, so acute that the ad- 
joining offices at a few yards distance are in another parish and 
county. 

Family of Makton.— The ancient family of Ralston, of that Ilk, 
whose estate of Ralston lay near Paisley, and of whom there is dis- 
tinct notice in the thirteenth century, held for upwards of 200 years 
the estate of Woodside in this parish, being part of the barony of 
Beith; butitwas sold in 1772 by the late Gavin Ralston, on whose 
death, in 1819, the male line of the family failed. There are still 
several families in the district connected with them by collateral 
descent, and the estate of Woodside was in 1834 purchased by 
William Patrick, Esq. of Roughwood, whose maternal grandmo- 
ther was eldest daughter of Gavin Ralston of that Ilk. 

Other Families.— The ancestors of Mr Patrick of Hazlehead 
have held lands in the parish since 1663, and long previous thereto 
held lands in the parish of Kilwinning ; the family of Love of 
Three pwood since 1633; the family of Montgomery of Bogston, 
since 1663; and the family of Shedden of Roughwood since 1690.' 

Eminent Men.— This parish was the birth-place of Alexander 
Montgomerie, one of our more early and most celebrated Scottish 
poets. He was born at Hazlehead Castle. The estate of Hazle- 
head, as has already been mentioned, was a part of the lordship 
of GifFen, and was given to a younger branch of the family of 
Eglinton. In Pont's Cunninghame Typographized, it is said that 
« Hazlehead Castell is a strong old building environed with lairge 
ditches, seatted on a loch, veill planted and comodiously beautified 
the heritage of Robert Montgomery, Laird thereof; famous it is 
for ye birth of yat renoned poet, Alexander Montgomery." This 
account was written about 1608, recently after the death of the 
poet, and gives authenticity to the statement as to the place of 
his birth. The fame of Montgorfierie rests chiefly upon « The 
Cherry and the Slae," his longest poem ; though in some of his 
minor pieces, there is a higher degree of refined sentiment and 
poetical feeling, 

Huh Montgomerie of Braidstane, a cadet of the family of Eg 
Imgton, was a person of much sagacity, and, by an occurrence al- 



586 



AYUSHIUE. 



together unconnected with his previous history, was raised to h'lrrh 
rank in Ireland. Tlie transaction has only recently been brought 
to notice by the publication of the Montgomery Manuscripts at 
Belfast in 1830, and by Dr Reid's History of the Presbyterian 
Church in Ireland, to which works reference is here made. 

Montgomery was knighted by King James, who gave him the 
precedency of his rival, James Hamilton, afterwards Lord Clan- 
deboy. He was afterwards created Viscount Montgomery of Ards, 
and his son was created Earl Mount Alexander. Hugh Mont- 
gomery took with him from this parish several families, who settled 
upon his Irish estate, and whose descendants remain in that dis- 
trict of the country, many of them being highly respectable. The 
last Earl Mount Alexander having died without issue, the title 
became extinct, the estates passed from the family, and a great 
part of them now belongs to the Marquis of Londonderry. 

We have formerly noticed the patriotism of William Mure, 
who took the command of a small party of Covenanters after 
the meeting at Shitterflatt, and marched to join their country- 
men, then in the field near Edinburgh, and of his forfeiture 
and personal sufferings. We refer for the particulars to the 
histories of that interesting period. His collateral descendant, 
William Mure of Glanderston, who succeeded to Caldwell, was 
also a sufferer in the public cause in 1683, as mentioned by 
Wodrow. His grand-nephew. Baron William Mure of Cald- 
well, was educated under charge of the Rev. William Leechman, 
afterwards minister of Beith, and subsequently Professor of Di- 
vinity, and Principal of the University of Glasgow. Mr Leech- 
man paid great attention to the formation of the character of his 
pupil, and had the gratifying pleasure of seeing his labours reward- 
ed. Mr Mure was acknowledged to be a man of high talents for 
business, and of most honourable principle. Soon after he reach- 
ed majority, he was chosen representative for Renfrewshire, and 
kept his seat for twenty years, having been thrice returned without 
opposition. He was held in high esteem by the Government, 
and was entrusted with the management of much of the public 
affairs of Scotland, and was in 'habits of familiar correspondence 
with Hume, Robertson, and many other eminent literary men. 
In 1761, he was appointed one of the Barons of Exchequer, which 
office he held until his death in 1776. He married Katherine, 
daughter of the Honourable James Graham, Lord Easdale, one 
of the Judges of the Court of Session. His eldest son, the lafe

William Mure of Caldwell, entered the army in early life as a 
cornet in the Blues. He afterwards commanded a company in 
the 82d Foot, — was in the American war under Lord Cornwallis, 
— was wounded, and taken prisoner in 1780. After being ex- 
changed, he was with Lord Cornwallis at the capitulation of the 
British at Yorktown in October 178L On his return to Scot- 
land, he was appointed to the command of the West Lowland 
Fencibles and Renfrewshire Mihtia. For many years prior to his 
death, which happened on February 1831, he was Vice-Lieutenant 
of Renfrewshire, and was active and zealous in the discharge of 
his public duties. His son, the present William Mure of Cald- 
well, is well known as an eminent classical scholar. He has writ- 
ten " Brief Remarks on the Chronology of the Egyptian Dynas- 
ties," and " A Dissertation on the Calendar and Zodiac of An- 
cient Egypt," works of erudition and research. 

Humphrey Fulton, who introduced to Paisley the silk manu- 
factory, was a native of this parish. His ancestors were proprietors 
of the lands of Midtown of Threepwood in 1634, at which place 
he was born, 16th April 1713. He married Mary Cochran, a 
native of the parish, and removed to Paisley. He introduced there 
the manufacture of silk, and, in 1777, established a warehouse in 
Beith, from which near 300 weavers were employed. This brought 
for many years upwards of L. 100 per week to the place, and 
greatly increased its trade and population. Mr Fulton died in 
1779; and the epitaph which was written at the time is a just tri- 
bute to his memory. 

The business was carried on for some years by his sons, Robert 
and William, men of highly respectable character. Robert pur- 
chased the estate of Hartfield, which is now inherited by his son, 
Colonel Robert Fulton, and William purchased the estate of Park 
of Inchinnan, which has recently been sold. 

Robert Shedden, of Gower Street, London, Esq., was born in 

• In a more humble sphere was James M'Connell, drummer in Beith, the re. 
doubted champion of orthodoxy, whom it would be unfair to omit in this report 
He was a native of Wigton, where he was born in 1706. Having enlisted into the 
43d Regiment of foot, he was for a considerable period on foreign service. On the 
return of the regiment, the company to which he belonged was quartered in Beith 
where James married Jean Love, a native of the place. After obtainino- his dis' 
charge he returned to Beith and settled as a teacher. He was afterwards made con 
stalle, sherifT-officcr, and town drummer. Having a turn for polemical divinity he 
attacked Mr James Ferguson, minister of Kilwinning, as unsound in his doctrine 
and libelled him before the Presbytery of Irvine. The case remained in the Clmrch 
Courts for some years, and Mr Ferguson died before it was finally disposed of The 
drummer published two pamphlets on this subject, which arc now become scarce 
They shew some talent, and much zeal in the cause.

this parish. He was eldest son of WilHam Shedden, who was 
second son of Robert Shedden of Roughwood, by Beatrice, daugh- 
tej- of Robert Dobie, Chamberlain of Giffen. In early life he 
went to America, and settled as a merchant at Norfolk in Vir- 
ginia. At the commencement of the American war he left Vir- 
ginia, and, after living some time in Bermuda arid New York, re- 
turned to England in 1783, and settled in London as an under- 
writer and general merchant. His unwearied attention and cor- 
rect and honourable principles soon acquired an extensive busi- 
ness, which in due time brought him great wealth. He proved a 
distinguished benefactor to the place of his nativity. In particu- 
lar, he purchased the lands of Gatend, in this parish, which he 
burdened with a perpetual annuity of L.50, which he vested in 
trustees, who were directed to apportion the same among persons 
of respectable character, and who had resided three years in the 
parish, in annuities not exceeding L.IO, nor less than L.5 to each. 
This grant has been of great benefit to the receivers, and the 
same has hitherto been awarded by the trustees in the most judi- 
cious manner. Mr Shedden died in London, 29th September 
1826, aged 85. He was married to Agatha, daughter of John 
Godrich, Esq. She died at the Isle of Wight, 3Ist January 1838. 

Among other eminent individuals connected with this parish, 
must be noticed William Wilson of Cumnock. He was one of 
the original partners of the house of Messrs John Gilmore and 
Company of Calcutta, and returning to this country in 1814, he 
purchased the property of Cumnock, where he resided until his 
death in 1836, at the age of 84. He was unwearied in well-do- 
ing, giving liberally to all the public and private subscriptions of 
the place. In 1832, he purchased the estate of Willowyards, 
which had belonged to his maternal ancestors. In his deed of 
settlement he left L.lOO to be laid out in paying house-rents, or 
purchasing clothes for aged people residing in the parish. 

Dr Robert Patrick of Trearne entered the army in early life, and 
was for upwards of ten years employed in foreign service. Upon 
his return home after the peace, he was appointed Inspector of 
Hospitals for a district in England, and afterwards was promoted 
to be an Inspector General. He devoted much of his time to ru- 
ral affairs, and to his duties as a magistrate, and was deservedly 
held in high esteem in the parish. He died in Edinburgh, 24th 
March 1838, and left L. 100 for charitable purposes, and L. 20

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy/. — From the table given of the 
different trades, it will be seen how that part of the population is 
employed. The landward part of the parish is very well peopled, 
there being a considerable part of the land in small farms, occu- 
pied by the owners whose valued rent is from L. 10 to L. 70 Scots. 
According to the usual routine of this district, the tenant is allowed 
to take two crops of grain, then sow grass, and thereafter the land to 
lie in pasture for five years, so that he goes through an arable farm 
in eight years, but he has an option of taking a green crop between 
the two grain crops if he chooses. The lands are manured with 



690 



AYRSHIRE. 



lime or dung during each rotation. There are few sheep kept. 
The pasture lands are occupied by milk cows of the best Ayrshire 
breed. Their produce is disposed of partly in butter, but chiefly in 
cheese, which may be considered as the staple article, from which  
at least two-thirds of the rents are raised ; great attention is there- 
fore paid to the dairy. The cheese is considered equal to the best 
Dunlop, and bears the highest price as such in the Glasgow mar- 
ket. The tenants seldom carry their cheese to the Glasgow mar- 
ket themselves. They dispose of it to a class of cheese-merchants 
or middlemen, who purchase from the tenants, and attend the dis- 
posal of it in the markets. Many of these cheese-merchants have 
made considerable fortunes. Mr James Pindlay, a well-known 
dealer, has erected a large storehouse at Easter Highgate in 
which he has often J 2,000 stones of cheese, and 1000 bolls of oat- 
meal. He carries a very large quantity to the Glasgow market 
yearly. The number of milk cows, pastured in the parish, may 
amount to 900, besides young cattle ; and as the greater part of the 
produce of the cows is made into cheese, it may be estimated to ave- 
rage from 12 to 16 stone tron, being 18 or 24 stone English each 
cow. A considerable quantity of milk is also carted into the ad- 
joining villages, which is found a more profitable mode of disposing 
of it, when the distance is great, than by making cheese or but- 
ter. Rye-grass is extensively grown for sale, and in the town and 
parish there are sed-merchants who make very considerable pur- 
chases, and make large shipments to England. The fur drainage 
has lately been carried on very extensively in the parish. It was 
first attempted by Mr Cunninghame of Lainshaw, with stones. The 
tile-drainage was then introduced by the Duke of Portland, who 
carried it to a very great extent. There was at first a prejudice 
against tiles in this neighbourhood, in which there is abundance of 
stones, and the fur drains were for some time made exclusively with 
stones. The prejudice has now given way, and two tile-works have 
lately been erected in the parish, which have not hitherto been able 
to supply tha demand. On the drained lands, wheat and beans are 
now partially reared, and the fur drainage has greatly improved the 
quality of the pasturage. The stock of cattle has also much im- 
proved ; and the late Dr Patrick of Trearne, Mr Patrick of Rough- 
wood, and Captain Patrick of Drumbowie, for many years have 
given premiums to their tenants for the best cattle kept and reared 
by them, as shewn at an annual exhibition. This has been produc- 
tive of much benefit, and is an example worthy of imitation by 



BEITH. 



591 



other landed proprietors. The real rental of the landw.ird part of 
the parish may be stated at L. 10,000 Sterling, being at the rate of 
about L. 1, 10s. per Scots acre of the whole parish. 

Bate of Wages.— The wages of farm-servants are- males, L. 8 ; 
females, from L. 3 to L. 4, in the half-year. The wages of la- 
bourers are 2s. per day without victuals. 

Manufactures.— There is a considerable quantity of thread made 
annually, by which about 200 persons are employed ; and a mill 
for spinning flax has recently been erected at North-bar, two miles 
from the town, which employs upwards of 80 people. The sole 
proprietor of this work is Mr James Crawford, manufacturer in 
Beith, who has set down several houses for the accommodation of 
his workers, and has begun to feu, so that in a few years a village 
will be formed at this establishment. There is at Roughbank, on 
the march of the parish, to the north, a thriving similar establish- 
ment, but on a less scale, belonging to William Patrick, Esq- and 
occupied by Mr Thomas Caldwell. There is at this place a mill 
for making potatoe flour, which employs about 14 individuals. The 
tanning and currying of leather is carried on to a great extent in 
Beith by Messrs John Muir, Robert Ramsay, and Bryce Muir, 
under the firms of " John Muir and Company," and " Muir and 
Ramsay." The works are well conducted, and employ 35 per- 
sons. At Threepwood, in the north-east of the parish, there are 
two bleachfields, one belonging to Mr Hugh Stevenson, the other 
to Messrs John Stevenson and Son, at both of which considerable 
business is done. Mr James Stevenson of Threepwood has erect- 
ed at Knows, in the neighbourhood, an estabhshment of 38 steam 
looms, which employs about 30 individuals. The machinery is of 
the newest construction, and has been chiefly formed by one of 
his sons, a young man of considerable skill in mechanics. In the 
town and parish, there are several merchants who deal very exten- 
sively in grain ; and while it is difficult to say what forms the staple 
article of the commerce of Beith, it is not difficult to add, that the 
spirit of enterprise in the place is considerable, and is on the in- 
crease, embracing a share of all sorts of merchandise. The town 
is well lighted with gas. The Gas Company was instituted in 1831, 
and the stock is held in L. 10 shares. The capital is L. 1600, on 
which the dividends have rated from 5 to 8 per cent, annually. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
.Mar/fes, §-c.— There has been, for a long period, a weekly mar- 
ket in Beith. It used to be held on Saturday ; but after the Scots 



592 



AYllSHIllE. 



Statute 1695, prohibiting Saturday markets, it was changed to 
Friday, upon which day it still remains. On this day, there is no 
exposing of articles on the street for sale, but country people at- 
tend to transact business, and fairs are always held on this day, 
except such as are fixed on a particular day of the month, such as 
the festival of St Inan, vulgarly called Tenants day, which is held 
on 18th August, old style. This fair is celebrated for its show and 
sale of horses, and is attended by a great concourse of people. The 
other more particular fairs are New Years-day Friday, Candlemas 
Friday, May Cow Fair, and Martinmas Friday, all of which are 
held on the first Fridays of the respective months of January, Fe- 
bruary, May, and November, old style. There used formerly to 
be a fair in June, called the Trades Race, in which the trades as- 
sembled and went in procession through the town with music and 
flags, but this has long been given up. On the day after the Trades 
Race, the merchants of the town used to meet and walk in proces- 
sion, and afterwards dine together. The procession has also been 
giyen up for many years, but the convivial part of the ceremony 
is still retained, and the annual dinner continues to be respectably 
attended. This society is of some standing. They have a regular 
minute-book, from which it appears that they were constituted as 
a society prior to 1727, and it is said, that at their first institution 
they held a charter from the Earl of Eglinton. They have a set 
of useful rules which are in verse, and are read over to the new 
members at their initiation. The president is annually elected, 
and during the festival is styled " my Lord." This society com- 
prehends all the merchants in town. All those who commence 
business are called upon at the return of the festival, and in some 
degree compelled to enter. Founding upon the long continuance 
of the custom, the office-bearers have considered themselves en- 
titled to use compulsory means to make the new merchant join 
their society, and failing his doing so, to seize brevi manu his goods 
to the value of the entry money. On a principle of this kind, it was 
decided by the Court of Session in the case of Callender, 11 th July 
1672, M. D. 10892, that " forty years possession gave a Sheriff 
right to ride a fair, and exact so much for gloves, and for the best 
staig in the fair," although there was no special grant on which the 
exaction was founded ; but it has not been necessary of late to re- 
sort to compulsory measures with the Beith merchants, to make 
them become members of this society, as the doing so and attend- 
ing the annual meeting is considered a matter of amusement and 



BEITH. 



593 



conviviality. There is still a iiir in July called the Cadgers' Race, 
in which the carters ride in procession through the town. In the 
van the oldest cadger or carter rides, having a string of bells round 
the horse's neck. The horse which gains the race has the honour 
of returning from the race course bearing the bells, and its owner 
retains the custody of them till next year. For some years, the far- 
mers of the parish joined in this procession, on which occasions 
there was an imposing exhibition of excellent horses ; but they 
have not done so for many years, and this remnant of ancient cus- 
tom has dwindled away to compai-ative insignificance. 

Villages. — Above a mile to the east of the town, there is a 
village called Gateside, where there are 150 inhabitants ; and at 
Northbarand Burnhouse, on the road to Kilmarnock, two villages 
ai'e now forming. 

Means of Commimication, — There is a daily coach from Ar- 
drossan to Glasgow, which passes through Beith in the morning 
and returns in the evening. There are two carriers three times 
a-week to Paisley ; two twice a-week to Glasgow ; two weekly to 
Kilmarnock ; two to Greenock ; one to Saltcoats ; and one to 
Largs. The post-office communications are very advantageous. 
There are two arrivals and departures daily, and a free delivery of 
letters twice a-day, and a penny-post daily to the neighbouring 
towns of Dairy, Kilbirnie, and Lochwinnoch. 

Banks. — There are four branches of Banks, the Commercial 
Bank of Scotland, the Glasgow Union, the British Linen Com- 
pany, and the Paisley Commercial. 

Ecclesiastical History. — The church of Beith was originally a 
chapel planted by the monastery of Kilwinning. The monks en- 
joyed the tithes and revenues, and found a curate to do the duty. 
At the Reformation the tithes of Beith produced yearly 169 bolls 
and 2 pecks of meal, 9 bolls, 3 firlots, and 2 pecks of bear, and 
L. 43, 5s. Scots in money, for a part of the tithes which had been 
let on lease. About the period of the Reformation, the Abbot 
and Chapter feued out the lands in the barony for small feu- 
duties. These passed with the other temporahties of the Church 
to Hugh fifth Earl of Eglinton, who was created Lord of Erection 
of the monastery. 

The first minister of whom we have any notice after the Re- 
formation, is Thomas Boyd, who was Reader there in 1573. 
His stipend was first L. 20, afterwards L. 25, " with the kirk-land, 
to be payit out of the third of Kilwynnyng for payment thairof

ministers, whose duty it was to read the Scriptures and common 
prayers to the people. After they advanced in knowledge, 
they were authorized to add short exhortations, and were then 
called Exhorters. The readers having taken upon them to solem- 
nize marriage, and administer the sacraments, ' were prohibited 
from the exercise of these duties by the General Assembly, — an 
example of which is given by Calderwood, who states that in 1574, 
" the reader of Dairy was complained upon by Mr David Lindsay, 
Commissioner of Kyle, Carrick, and Cunninghame, for that be- 
ing discharged of all ministration of the Lord's Supper, he not- 
withstanding ministered the same after his manner, in the place of 
Kilburnie, in the last Easter. The Assembly ordained him to make 
his public repentance two several Sabbaths, upon the one in Kil- 
burnie and upon the other in Dairy ; and if he commit the like, 
that he be deposed, and that this act strike upon all readers that 
shall be found guiltie of the like." These enactments were re- 
newed, but being transgressed, the order was in 1581 suppressed, 
the office being concluded, " to be no ordinar office in the kirk of 
God." 

After Mr Boyd, Mr John Young was minister of Beith. He ob- 
tained from the King a grant during his own lifetime of the whole 
tithes of the parish, and which grant was afterwards ratified by Mr 
William Melville, commendator of Tungland who acquired right 
to the temporalities of Kilwinning, on Mr Young's paying him 
L. 5 Scots yeariy. Mr Young, with several of his brethren, was 
called before the Lords of the Secret Council on a charge of serious 
import. Various statutes had been passed prohibiting intercourse 
with Catholic priests, and imposing severe penalties on those who 
should harbour them. These enactments had not been successful-; 
and in 1609 an act was passed renewing the former statutes, and 
giving power to the Secret Council to call those who should con- 
travene the law before them and inflict punishment. On 31st 
January 1610, The records of the Secret Council bear, that " For- 
samekle as althocht the receipt, supplie, and intercomoning, with 
Jesuits, seminarie priestes, and trafficquing Papistis be prohibite 
and forbidden be diverss actis of Parliament and Secrit Counsell,

Harpar, minister at Kilbryd, and Johnne Fullarton, minister at

premissis, and to underlye suche oi'doure as sal be tane thairanent, 
under the pane of rebellioun, &amp;c. with confiscation," &amp;c. The 
result is not known, though probably Fader Chrisostome would 
leave the country, and his entertainers suffer rebuke. 

Mr Young was succeeded by Mr James Fullarton. His stipend 
was at first 3 chalders meal, and 300 merks of money. Having 
brought a process of augmentation in 1635, the Commissioners 
increased the same to b chalders victual, 300 merks of money, 
and 40 merks for communion elements. This continued the sti- 
pend of the parish till 1806. During Mr Fullarton's incumbency, 
it was proposed to remove the Kirk of Beith to a more central 
part of the parish. An act of the Scots Parliament was passed 
for this purpose in 1633, the preamble of which is curious : — 
" Our Sovereign Lord and his States of this present Parliament, 
being certainlie informit that the Kirk of Beith, lyand within the 
presbyterie of L-vine, and bailliarie of Cunynghame, quhair the 
same was of old situat, and now presentlie stands, is most remote and 
far distant from the moste pairt of the haill parichioners and pa- 
rochine of Beythe, situate upon the north and north-west pairts of 
the said parochine of Beithe, rieir approatching to the parochine 
of Loquhinzeche, the parichioners quhairof sua incroatches, and 
takes up the places and stallis of the ordinar parichioners of Beythe, 
that in the summer seasone they cannot convenientlie come and ad-

dress thamseUfes to sermones and sacraments to tliair said parocli 
kirk; and in the winter seasone thairisdifficultie in ryding vpon liorse 
and walking vpon feete ; that the most pairt of the saids parichioners 
of Beithe being distant from thair said paroch kirk be the space of 
three or four myllis or thairby, cannot goodhe address and con- 
vene thameselffs thairto be reassoun of the stormes of weather, 
and of the deip and evil wayes adjacent thairto." The statute 
then proceeds to enact, that there be ane new kirk planted in a 
more commodious part of the parish, and that there be a new 
manse and glebe, conform to law, — the new kirk, manse, and 
glebe to be built at the expense of the heritors, who were to have 
power to apply the old buildings, glebe, and glebe lands for that 
purpose ; but the proposal was not put into execution. 

Mr Fullarton was succeeded by Mr Patrick Colville, a man of 
talent, who was frequently employed in committees on public 
affairs, during the troublesome times of his incumbency. At the 
indulgence, Mr William Maitland from Whithorn was appointed 
by an act of the Privy-Council in 1669, and in 1672. Under the 
second indulgence, Mr William Creighton was conjoined with 
him, though it is doubtful if he ever accepted. 

It is well-known that the indulged ministers had great difficulty 
in recovering their stipends, and it appears that Mr Maitland had 
been in that predicament. The records of the privy-council, 1st 
March 1677, have the following entry, " anent a petition presented 
by Mr William Maitland, minister at Beith, showing that the pe- 
titioner had served the cure at the said kirk, the two byegone years, 
1675 and 1676, without receiving any stipend; albeit he hath 
himself and a numerous family to manteane, which he will not 
be longer able to undergo unless the Lords of Counsel be pleased 
to allow him the said stipend for the said two years service ; and 
therefore humbly supplicating that an order afid warrant might be 
granted for that effect, in manner under-written ; the Lords of His 
Maj. Privie Counsel having heard and considered the foresaid 
petition, do hereby grant order and warrant to the heritors and 
others liable in payment of the stipend of the said paroch of Beith, 
to make payment to the petitioner, aad that for ilk one of said 
crops and years of God, 1675 and 1676, and ordains letters of 
horning and others to be direct thereupon in form, as effeirs." 

Mr Maitland was succeeded in 1681 by Mr Robison, a curate, 
whose appointment is said to have been very unpopular. After the 
Revolution Mr Alexander Orr was admitted in 1690. In 1700, 



BEITH.

he was translated to St Qulvox, when Mr Robert Cameron was 
appointed to Beith. In his time the minister, with consent of the 
presbytery and heritors, entered into a contract of excambion with 
Alexander Earl of Eghnton, by which his Lordship gave the farm 
of Mainshill for the old glebe. This farm contains about 45 acres, 
and has added considerably to the value of the living. Mr Ca- 
meron died in 1735, and was succeeded by Mr William Leechman, 
who was translated to Glasgow, where he was first admitted Pro- 
fessorof Divinity, and afterwards chosen Principal of the University. 
He was succeeded in Beith by Mr John Witherspoon, a man of 
strong natural talents and decision of character, which he probably 
inherited from our Reformer, John Knox, of whom he was a lineal 
descendant. He was a native of Yester, in East Lothian, of which 
parish his father was minister. Soon after his ordination at Beith, 
the RebelHon broke out, and he was active in seconding the wishes 
of his parishioners, who raised a company of militia " in defence 
of our only rightful and lawful Sovereign, King George, against 
his enemies engaged in the present Rebellion." At the head of 
this patriotic band, Mr Witherspoon marched to Glasgow to join 
the King's army against the Pretender. . When they arrived there, 
they received orders to return, and with this the company com- 
plied ; but the reverend commander went forward, was at the Battle 
of Falkirk, where the rebels were victorious, and where he was 
taken prisoner. He was carried to Doune Castle, and kept for 
.some time. Along with him was the Rev. Andrew M'Vey, after- 
wards minister of Dreghorn, who got out of the state prison in the 
disguise of a female carrying a tea-kettle. Several parishes in 
this district sent out parties of volunteers in aid of the Government, 
and to this they were encouraged by a resolution of the Presbytery 
of Irvine, 7th January 1746. Mr Witherspoon married Elizabeth, 
daughter of Robert Montgomery of Craighouse, in this parish. 
He was translated to Paisley, and went afterwards to America, 
where he was appointed President of the College of Princeton in 
New Jersey. He introduced into the system of education there all 
the improvements of this country, and the cause of education, and 
science in America was greatly promoted by his exertions. He 
was repeatedly sent to Congress, and was one of the subscribers 
to the declaration of Americari Independence. His political con- 
duct showed that he considered it his duty to be a faithful subject 
to the Government under which he lived, whatever the form of 
that government might be. Immediately after the peace of 1783,

he paid a visit to his native country, where he spent some days 
among his friends in Beith, and preached in the church. He died 
on 15th November 1794, in the 73d year of his age. His family 
and descendants are numerous and respectable. His fame did 
not die with him, as his theological writings, particularly his cele- 
brated " Essay on Regeneration," are quoted as works of great merit. 
His whole works were published at Edinburgh 1804, in ninevolumes, 
octavo, and some of them have reached several editions. He was 
succeeded in Beith by Mr David M'Lellan, a man of whom it 
was said that he united in his character the gentleman, scholar, and 
Christian. He died 22d October 1796, and was succeeded by Mr 
Robert M'Vey. In his time, the stipend, which had remained for 
170 years without any increase, was augmented to 8 chalders meal, 
L. 400 Scots of money, and L. 100 Scots for communion elements. 
A new manse was built in 1796, and a new church was begun 
20th March 1807, and opened for divine service on 19th August 
1810. The church is set down on the lands of Knockbuckle, and 
stands high ; its site is 343 feet above the level of the sea. When 
the church was removed a small part of the old building was al- 
lowed to remain, to preserve the clock and bell for the use of the 
town. 

Mr M'Vey died 3d July 1811, and was succeeded by Mr 
James Muir. During his incumbency, the stipend was augment- 
ed to 16 chalders of victual, half meal, half barley, with L.15 Ster- 
ling for communion elements. Mr Muir died in 1831, and was 
succeeded by the present incumbent, who was translated from Kil- 
winning, to which parish he was ordained in 1824. 

The church, as is before-mentioned, was opened for public 
worship in August 1810. It is seated for 1254 persons, giving 
18 inches for each sitting. At the division, the heritors set apart 
183 sittings for the use of the inhabitants of the town. They are 
let annually for the benefit of the poor's fund. The remainder of 
the church was divided among the heritors, which gave them a 
sitting for L.6, 10s. Scots of valued rent. The church and tower 
cost L.2790. The bell in the tower, one of the finest toned in 
the west country, was the gift of Robert Shedden, Esq. Gower 
Street, London, a native of the parish, of whom some notice is 
taken elsewhere. The church, manse, and offices are all in a good 
state of repair. 

Education. — There was a school early established in this pa- 
rish, lu a charter dated 14th November 1644, there occurs the 



BEITH. 



599 



name of Mr John Maxwell, schoolmaster at the kirk of Beith, as 
a witness. The session record, of date 9th November 1693, bears, 
that after sermon the minister, heritors, and elders met, and agreed 
with Mr Chapman to be their schoolmaster. This was three years 
before the statute 1696 of William III. ordaining a school to be 
settled in every parish. Since that date there has been a regular 
succession of parish schoolmasters. The salary was 100 merks 
Scots until the passing of the statute in 1803, when it was fixed 
at the minimum or 300 merks, with a house and an allowance for 
a garden. At the expiry of the first twenty-five years the salary 
was made L. 26 Sterling, being at the rate of one penny Sterling 
on each pound Scots of valued rent. The schoolmaster receives 
the statutory value for a garden, but it is in contemplation by the 
heritors to build a new school-house, and inclose garden ground 
in terms of law. 

The present parish schoolmaster, Mr James Reid, who was 
elected in May 1832, holds the office of session-clerk; but the 
offices of precentor and kirk-treasurer, though sometimes united, 
are held by difi'erent individuals. Besides the parish school, there 
are five other schools in the town, and three in the landward part 
of the parish. The total number of scholars is 500, being nearly the 
tenth part of the population. There are also several Sabbath even- 
ing schools, which are well attended. They are all taught gra- 
tuitously ; and the long-continued labours of Mr William Clark, 
merchant, in this department, have been most creditable to him- 
self and beneficial to his pupils. The Sabbath evening school 
which meets in the parish church is superintended by the minister 
and Mr Reid, the parochial schoolmaster. It is taught by about 
sixteen teachers, and attended by about 200 children. In con- 
nexion with this school, Mr Reid, with the assistance of two or 
three benevolent individuals, teaches gratuitously a school two 
evenino's in the week, which is of great benefit to a numerous 
portion of the poor-er children, whose necessary employment pre- 
vents them from attending the day school. 

Dissenters. — There is a congregation of the Associate Synod, 
which was formed in 1761. Their first ordained minister was 
Mr John Laidlaw, who remained only about two years, and with- 
drew from their communion. " He was succeeded by the Reverend 
Andrew Mitchell, a man of sincere piety, who was respected by 
people of all denominations. He died in 1812. His eldest son, 
the Reverend John Mitchell, D. D. Glasgow, is one of llie Pro- 



jOO 



AYRSHIRE. 



fessors of Divinity of the United Associate Synod. Mr Mitchell 
was succeeded by the Reverend James Meiklc, who was ordained 
in September 1812, and is now minister. Their church was re- 
built in 1816, and is capable of holding 500 people. They have 
a good substantial dwelling-house, and suitable offices and garden 
for their minister. 

There is also a congregation of Relief, which was formed in 
1784. Their first ordained minister was the Reverend John Har- 
riot; their second the Reverend William Thomson, who was 
placed in 1788, and was translated in 1800 to Hutchisontoun, 
Glasgow, where he now officiates. He was succeeded in 1802 by 
the Reverend James Anderson, the present minister. The Relief 
society have also a good manse, offices, and garden, with some 
acres of land adjoining, which they have recently commenced to 
feu. The church is seated for 849 persons. There is a school 
belonging to the society, which has a small endowment arising from 
the bequest of one of the heritors. 

Parochial Registers. — Few parish registers in the Presbytery 
are of older date than the Revolution. The earliest volume of 
the Beith register commences in 1659, and ends in 1758. It is 
imperfect, and for some years no entries are made ; sometimes 
births, baptisms, and marriages, are entered promiscuously. Bap- 
tism was generally administered "in presence of the hail congrega- 
tion," but it was also done at the houses of the parents, on which 
occasions the names of two of the witnesses present at the cere- 
mony are entered in the record. The more frequent way was to 
administer this ordinance in presence of the congregation, as di- 
rected by the Act of Assembly, 7th February 1645. It appears 
that baptism was administered very soon after the birth of the 
child, sometimes on the same day. The laws against disorder- 
ly baptism were severe, and by the statute 22d Charles II. 
1672, those who delayed the baptism of their children beyond 
thirty days, were subjected in very heavy penalties. Besides, it 
was the popular belief, that infants perished who died unbaptised, 
and until baptism that they were more readily subject to the power 
of witchcraft. Of late years, the register has been kept with greater 
accuracy and care, but there are comparatively few births regis- 
tered. 

While on this subject it may be remarked, that the mode of 
conducting funerals has of late years undergone considerable 
change. Formerly large companies were invited, there being fre- 



BE ITU. 



GOl 



quently from two to three hundred uidividuals asked to a funeral, 
the greater number of whom attended. Now the parties are smal- 
ler, and the custom of having an entertainment seems gradually 
to be giving way. Funerals are thus less expensive, and occupy 
less time ; but many are of opinion that it lessens the solemnity 
when there is no religious exercise ; and it is well known that the 
hearts of individuals have been affected by prayers at a funeral, 
which have resisted or neglected more ordinary appeals. It has 
been suggested, that a prayer might be offered immediately after 
the body is laid in the grave, and, doubtless, the place and cir- 
cumstances are well calculated to impress serious thoughts on the 
mind ; but the weather is not always favourable for this exercise,, 
and it is a subject on which it would be easy to excite prejudice 
and misconception, and, so far as is known, the experiment has 
not been tried. 

Poor and Pai'ochial Funds. — The kirk-session hold two small 
farms in the parish, which were purchased by sums mortified for be- 
hoof of the poor. The rents of both are at present L. 78 yearly. The 
average collections at the church-door are L. 70. Hearse hires and 
mortcloth dues yield L. ] 0 ; and fees for proclamations,' &amp;c. about 
L. 5. The seats in the church, set apart for the population of the 
town, and let annually, yield L. 14. These produce L. 177. The 
expenditure for the poor is somewhat above this, and the surplus is 
provided for by occasional assessments in the parish. The allow- 
ance to the poor on the ordinary roll is from 4s. to 6s. monthly. 
The number on the roll at present is 30. 

Town-House. — In 1817, this house was built by subscription. 
The lower part consists of two shops, the rents of which are ap- 
plied for public purposes, without any return to the subscribers. 
The upper story is a large hall, in which are held the Justice of 
Peace Courts, the Sheriff Small Debt Circuit Courts, meetings 
of the road trustees, &amp;c. It is also used as a public reading-room. 
There is in the lower part of the building a lock-up, in which cri- 
minals are confined, preparatory to their being sent to Ayr, or in 
modum pcBnae of minor offences. 

It was stipulated that the management of this house, and the 
affairs connected therewith, should for the first twenty years after 
July 1818 remain with the subscribers, and after that period should 
be transferred to the four following classes of persons : — 1. All the 
Justices of the Peace in the parishes of Beith, Dairy, and Kil- 
birnie, being the parishes forming the district of Beith ; 2. Heri- 



602 



AVRSIIIUE. 



tors of the parishes whose valued rent is L. 60 Scots and upwards ; 
3. Proprietors of houses in the town of Beith, or within half a mile 
of the cross, of L. 7 of yearly rent or value ; and, 4, The te- 
nants of such houses. The twenty years expired in July 1838, 
and the management has now been taken up by the new con- 
stituency. 

Benevolent Societies. — Many years ago, several societies were in- 
stituted for affording relief to aged and indigent members. But 
as nothing was contributed after the original subscription, and as 
there was thus no annual supply, the funds could not stand the de- 
mands when the members became old and required aid. The 
consequence was, that they were consumed, and the societies ceased. 
No attempt has been made to form one on the basis recommend- 
ed by the Highland Society of Scotland, of making the entrance- 
money on a scale corresponding to the age of the members, which 
has been proved the sure foundation of permanency and efficiency. 
This is much to be regretted, as there is nothing so gratifying to 
the independent minded man as the reflection of having laid 
aside, in the day of comparative prosperity, for the day of his ad- 
versity, to wKich all are more or less liable. Of late, a sort of 
substitute for the friendly society has been adopted in what is cal- 
led a Menage. This is a common fund contributed equally at so 
much a-week ; and at a time fixed, each person draws his share 
by lot. He thus gets L. 1 or L. 1, 10s. at one time, which aids 
him in paying his house rent, but it is only drawing out in cumulo 
what he contributed periodically, and is no better than the old 
custom of the Pinner-Pig, only the money is put beyond reach 
until the date of drawing it out. There was a Savings Bank for se- 
veral years, which was broken up, and a new one formed in 1834.

ciety.

Mr John Kerr of Nettlehirst left L. 20 to found a society for 

purchasing clothing, blankets, and fire, for poor persons resident 

in the town and parish. The society was instituted in 1817, the 

year in which Mr Kerr died, and has been very well supported. 

The average expenditure is about L. 20.

The late Dr Patrick of Hazlehead left L.20 to form a society 
for procuring clothing to old men in decayed circnmstances, and 
resident in the parish. A society has in consequence been re- 
cently instituted for this benevolent purpose, and it is to be hoped 
will meet with similar support. 

Public Libraries. — There is a subscription library in the town, 
which contains 400 volumes, but it has not been well supported. 
There are also two circulating libraries. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Since the last Statistical Account was written, very considerable 
improvements have taken place in this parish. The roads, both 
turnpike and parochial, are in better order, though in this matter 
there is certainly much room for farther improvement. The houses 
of the wealthier inhabitants are, with few exceptions, more com- 
modious and comfortable, but many of the weavers and labourers, 
and even farmers, are meanly lodged. In the town, there are 
many thriving respectable merchants and traders; and Beith is 
distinguished above most places of the kind by the wealth of not a 
few of its inhabitants. All sorts of cloths, groceries, and butcher- 
meat can be got here as good as in Glasgow, and the number of 
shops for retailing these articles shews that the demand is great. 
That the morals of the people are improved in proportion to their 
means and opportunity, it would perhaps be hazardous to assert. 
Certainly there is no longer that reckless daring of the law which 
was characteristic of the place when it was a seat of smuggling ; 
yet offences are too frequent, which are generally the results of 
excessive drinking, — a prevailing vice in this place as in most others 
at the present day, and it is melancholy to see the idleness, pro- 
fanity, and wretchedness to which it leads. Here the people have 
many strong and encouraging proofs that industry and sobriety can 
raise not only to independence, but to wealth, for here there are 
men who began the world, after having got only the most ordinary 
education, and without any earthly means to assist them, but their 
own health and prudence, and who noware living with their fami- 
lies in affluence, respected by all, and relieving the necessities of 
many who commenced with equal means of success. There has 
always been a due share of valour and patriotism in this place. 
At the Revolution, a company of volunteers was raised in defence 
of the King and constitution, and we have already noticed the com- 
pany raised by Mr Wotherspoon in 1745. During the war with 
Buonaparte, the Beith volunteers and local militia were always 



60-1 



AYRSHIRE 



prompt and respectable ; and individuals belonging to the place 
have fought with Abercromby in Egypt, with Nelson at Trafal- 
gar, and with Wellington at Waterloo. There is a generous feel- 
ing in the better classes towards their inferiors, which has been 
evinced in liberal subscriptions and exertions for them during pe- 
riods of public distress. Were there more morality and sobriety, 
there would be less poverty and want, and the indigent would be 
more cheerfully and liberally supplied, having the claims of cha- 
racter to plead on their behalf, and giving the assurance that they 
would use prudently and beneficially the alms they received. There 
is generally speaking a good attendance on public worship, yet it 
is to be regretted that this divine and merciful ordinance is most 
neglected by the operative and poorer classes, who, being less en- 
lightened by education, and having a greater struggle with the 
world, and being more exposed to the snares and temptations of 
sin, stand in the greater need of the instructions and warnings, aids, 
and consolations of the Gospel preached. And it is painful to con- 
clude, that, amid many favourable symptoms, there is mingled much 
carelessness about religion, and much profanation of the Sabbath ; 
while many are given to intemperance and vice, bringing on them- 
selves, and entailing on their helpless families, wretchedness and 
misery, and gradually undermining those habits of industry, and 
that spirit of independence, which were so long characteristic of 
the people of Scotland.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JAMES PORTEOUS, MINISTER. 



I. TOPOGKAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

'Etymology. — Riccarton, formerly Richardtown, was so called', 
it is commonly said, from a Richard Wallace, or Walays, or Va- 
lense, who was proprietor of lands in the neighbourhood. He is 
generally believed to have been uncle of the celebrated Sir Wil- 
liam Wallace ; but this is very doubtful. The parish seems to 
have borne the name of Richarton, long before this period. The 
Richard Wallace from whom the name of the parish and village is 
derived, was most probably the individual of that name to whom 
the estate was originally given by Walter High Steward of Scot- 
land, and who lived above 140 years before the time of Sir Wil- 
liam Wallace. 

Boundaries, Extent, 8fc. — The parish is bounded on the north, 
by the river Irvine, which separates it from Kilmarnock ; on the 
south, by Craigie, Mauchline, and Galston ; on the east, by Gal- 
ston ; and on the west, by Symington and Dundonald. Its length 
from east to west is about 8 miles, and its greatest breadth about 
3 miles. It is situated on the north verge of Kyle Stewart, which 
forms a part of the middle of the three grand divisions of the 
county. The village of Riccarton is distant from the cross of Kil- 
marnock one mile, and from Ayr eleven miles. 

Topographical Ajjpearances, 4-c.— The general aspect of the 
•parish is, upon the whole, beautiful. But there is not a great 
diversity of landscape. Its surface is gently undulating, the ground 
rising gradually towards the south and east, till it terminates in a 
ridge of hills of no great elevation,— the highest eminence not be- 
ing above .500 feet in height. The exposure is northern, which lays 
it open to the severe and chilly blasts from that direction. As the 
ground towards the south is considerably elevated above that on 
the north or Cunninghame side of the river, the view towards that 



606 



AYRSHIRE. 



quarter is very imposing, commanding a vast extent of beautiful 
country, but especially of the vale of the Irvine. At a very short 
distance west from the village, on the farm of Yardside, a view 
may be had of the populous and thriving town of Kilmarnock. 
The soil is rather of a stiff clayey nature, but when drained is cap 
pable of raising excellent crops. The holm lands immediately ad- 
joining the river are, in general, of superior quality. Some of the 
farms on which these lands are found, may be considered as valu- 
able and productive as any in the county. 

Hydrography. — There are only two streams of any size in the 
parish, — the Irvine, which bounds it on the north, and the Cess- 
nock, which intersects it, and enters the Irvine at a spot about three 
miles east of the village. The banks of the Irvine are here very 
tame and uninteresting, the grounds on both sides being almost 
quite flat, and, in some places, the waters kept in by artificial em- 
bankments. This, however, is not the general character of the 
banks of the Irvine. The banks of the Cessnock are much more 
picturesque and varied. It is reckoned an excellent fishing stream ; 
but from there being few enclosures on its banks, it is much in- 
jured by poaching. 

There are many copious and perennial springs in every quarter 
of the parish, but the waters of many of them having mineral im- 
pregnations, are not fit for domestic uses. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — There is a considerable variety of 
valuable minerals to be met with in different parts of the parish, 
such as coal, limestone, sandstone, and brick clay, and all of them 
of the best quality. The coal seems to be spread to a very wide 
extent. That found on Caprington estate is known to be of a su- 
perior quality, and is much used in the neighbourhood for common 
purposes : and not inferior in quality, though rather of a different 
texture and nature, is that worked on the lands of Skerrington and 
Barleith. The coal here seems to have been wrought from a very 
early date, as the old wastes which are occasionally met with, most 
clearly show. The blind-coal, or stone-coal, or anthracite, is of a pe- 
culiar nature. Though not exclusively confined to this parish, it is 
now chiefly got here, and the working of it is carried on to a very 
considerable extent. Its chemical constituents are 89 parts out of 
100 of pure carbon, 8.5 of volatile matter, and 1.5 of earthy sub- 
stances. It is of greater specific gravity than common coal, of 
greater hardness, and of a peculiar lustre. It burns without either 
smoke or flame, which renders it of invaluable importance m the 



RICCARTON. 



607 



drying of grain, malt, and for similar purposes. Its geological 
position is the lowest of all the coal strata, at least so far as has 
yet been ascertained ; for though coal has been searched for in 
the neighbourhood fully 45 fathoms below it, yet none has been 
found, though appearances are favourable. The direction of 
the dip of the coal strata is towards the south or south-easti The 
depth here varies from 40 fathoms till it crops out at the surface. 
The Wind coal is employed in the neighbourhood, but only in 
small quantities, for the burning of lime. It is chiefly exported to 
Ireland, and that in very large quantities, for the uses above spe- 
cified. It is carried for exportation to Troon from the Ca- 
prington coal-works by a railway, and from the other works by carts, 
either to Ayr or Irvine. Being scarce, it is much higher in price 
than the common fire coal, selhng at present at the pit mouth for 
7s. 6d. per imperial ton. Were it in this quarter employed in the 
smelting of metals, for which it is so well adapted, by its contain- 
ing so little volatile matter, and for which it is so much, and so 
sucessfully, used in different parts of England and Wales, — its 
value would be much increased. Its heating properties have been 
found by experiment to be fully more than double those of the com- 
mon bituminous coal. From an idea that it contains much sulphu- 
rous matter in its composition, it is not used as ordinary fuel. — The 
freestone found in the parish is very good, and is both of a red and 
of a yellowish colour. The limestone worked in the parish is rec- 
koned of superior quality, and is sold in great quantities, both for 
the purposes of building and agriculture. There are only two lime- 
works in the parish. In the limestone quarry, on the estate of 
Knockmarloch, are to be found many interesting petrifactions, both 
of vegetable and animal productions, as ferns, branches of trees, 
shells both univalve and bivalve. The quarry is situated on the 
north side of the Craigie hills, at an elevation of nearly 500 feet. 
From the excellent quality of the clay met with on different estates, 
the bricks and tiles made in the parish are in much repute. No 
ironstone has as yet been wrought here, but there can be no doubt 
of its existence. The rocks are all of the secondary and alluvial 
classes. 

II. — Civil Histouy. 
Village of Riccarton.— The village is of considerable antiquity; 

but it is not above seventy years since it became of any size, 

when the greatest part was feued from the Earl of Marchmont, hus- 
band of the heiress of Cessnock, to whom the adjoining lands be- 



COS 



AVIISHIRE. 



longed. There is no civil jurisdiction connected with it. The 
superiority of the greater part of it now belongs to the Duke of 
Portland ; and Mr Deans of Kirkstyle is superior of the remainder. 
Since the passing of the Reform Act, it has been included in the 
extended burgh of Kilmarnock. 

Eminent Characters. — In connexion with this" parish may be 
mentioned the famous Sir William Wallace, who resided here for 
some time with his paternal uncle, proprietor of the lands of Ric- 
carton. It is said that he fled hither after his slaughter of the 
noted Cumberland chief, Selby, governor of Dundee. During 
his stay here, according to Bhnd Harry, who narrates the exploit, 
while fishing in the Irvine, he encountered five English soldiers, 
three of whom he slew with his rod, when the other two fled. The 
scene of this bloody aff"ray is said to have been on the banks of the 
stream immediately below the farm-house of Maxholm, about 
half a-mile west of the church, and long marked out by a thorn 
bush, which, from that circumstance, was properly called the 
" bickering buss." This thorn has, of late years, been re- 
moved by some Gothic hand. Others suppose the scene to 
have been on the lands of Holms, on the opposite side of the 
river ; but of this the probability is very small. The mansion- 
house of Riccarton is now entirely destroyed. The farm-house 
of Yardside stands on the same site. Some remains, however, of 
the trees which surrounded it, and especially a pear-tree, said to 
have been planted by the hand of the hero himself, are still to be 
seen ; and it is reported that the stone now set over the fire-place 
of the manse kitchen, is the identical mantel-piece of the dining- 
room of that once venerable mansion. 

Sir John Cuninghame of Caprington, who was created a baro- 
net by King Charles II., was a lawyer of great eminence in his 
day. He was employed as counsel for his country against the 
Duke of Lauderdale's government in Scotland. Bishop Burnet, 
in his History of his Times, speaks of him as being "not only learned 
in the civil and canon law, and in all philosophical learning, but 
as being universal in all learning; a great divine, and besides 
had the most universal, and indeed the most deserved reputation 
for integrity and virtue of any man, not only of his profession, but 
of the whole nation." Mr John Cuninghame, second son of the 
above, was the first who read lectures on the Roman law in Scot- 
land as well as on Scotch law ; and he continued to do so till 1710, 
when he died. 



RrCCARTON. 



We have also to record, as connected with this parish by birth. 
Sir James Shaw, Baronet, the first Scotchman who had ever been 
Lord Mayor of London, and who is at present Chamberlain of 
that city. He was born at Mosshead, on the property of Trees- 
bank, and for some time resided here during his earlier years. 
Though long resident out of his native parish, he fondly remem- 
bers it, and contributes largely to any benevolent scheme in con- 
nection either with it or its neighbourhood. But delicacy prevents 
me from saying more of this much respected and most benevolent 
individual, 

 Colonel Macgregor, author of the Narrative of the Loss of the 
Kent East Indiaman, and at present head of the Constabulary in 
Ireland, is connected with the parish by property, having married 
a co-heiress of the late Sir Wilham Cuninghame of Caprington. 

Principal Land-moners. — Uh Grace the Duke of Portland; 
John Smith Cuninghame, Esq. of Caprington ; G. J. Campbell, 
Esq. of Treesbank ; the Hon. Colonel Macadam Cathcart of 
Craigengillan ; C. Shedden, Esq. of Knockmarloch ; W. Cuning- 
ham, Esq. of Lainshaw ; James Fairley, Esq. of Holmes ; Colonel 
Clark of Shawhill ; Captain Tait of Milrig ; Messrs Howie of 

Kaimshill ; Cambell of Skerrington ; Thomas Brown, Esq. 

of Lonfin ; Hamilton, Esq. of Hillhouse ; John Deans, Esq. 

of Kirkstyle ; and a few others of smaller property. 

Parochial Registers. — The only registers existing, or which seem 
ever to have been kept, are the session records, commencing with 
the year 1695; the registers of births and marriages and the mi- 
nutes of heritors' meetings. Except the registers of births and 
marriages, none seem to have been regularly kept ; and it is only 
within these last ten years that the minutes of the heritors have 
been at all accurately kept. The preservation of the oldest of 
these registers is altogether owing to the present session-clerk, Mr 
W. Hood, who, some time ago, with much labour and pains, col- 
lected them and other valuable papers connected with the parish, 
and who got them substantially bound, forming in all an import- 
ant parochial document. 

Ancient and Modern Buildinffs.—Remams of several ancient 
buildings are to be met with throughout the parish ; but none 
seem to have been of any great extent or importance. The Castle 
of Caprington, though much changed by late repairs, is a building 
of very considerable antiquity, being mentioned in a charter bet- 
longing to the family, bearing date 1085, under he name of

AYRSHIRE. 



" Castellum turris fortaliciutn de Caprington." It originally be- 
longed to a branch of the Wallace family. It stands in a low si- 
tuation, on the very banks of the Irvine ; yet at the same time it 
is considerably elevated above the grounds immediately surround- 
ing it, being built upon a fine basalt rock, curiously jutting out of 
the vale below. It is a very massy building, in tlie old baronial 
style, with a lofty tower iu the centre, over the main entrance, and 
which latter is protected by a spacious archway and towers, giving 
to the whole a very noble and commanding appearance. Consi- 
dering the immense size of the castle, and the good condition of 
the grounds, it may very fairly be considered the first residence in 
the parish. 

About a mile south of Caprington, is situated Treesbank, the 
beautiful residence of G. J. Campbell, Esq., representative and 
direct lineal descendant of the once distinguished family of the 
Campbells of Cessnock. The house is plain externally, but a 
large and handsome addition having just been made to it, it is now 
very comfortable and commodious. The grounds and the view 
from them are very beautiful. 

The other residences are Shawhill, a modern and very neat 
building. Dollars, Bellfield, and Milrig, which last is rebuilding 
in an elegant style. 

III. — Population. 
When the returns were made by Dr Webster in 1755, the po- 
pulation was only 745. In 1792, it had amounted to 1000, the 
increase being in the village. In 1821, it was 2122. In 1831, it 
has risen to 2499. There were then, according to the Govern- 
ment census, 356 houses ; 491 families ; 3 houses building, and 5 
uninhabited ; 85 families employed in agriculture ; 898 in trade, 
manufactures, &amp;c. ; and 8 families not belonging to either of the 
other two classes. There were 568 males upwards of twenty years 
of age ; 40 occupiers of the first class in agriculture ; 36 of the 
second-class; and 73 agricultural labourers. 283 people were em- 
ployed in retail trade and handicraft ; 17 were professional and 
educated men ; 70 labourers not agricultural. The village of Ric- 
carton at that time contained 945 individuals ; of these, 465 were 
males, 480 females. The males in the whole parish were 1250, 
females, 1249. By a private census made in 1838, the popu- 
lation was 2714. Males married, 520; widowers, 25; widows, 
40. Totalof females, 1404; of males, 1310. Children under 
twelve, 930; 40 individuals above seventy; 12 above eighty, one

in her ninetieth year, and another in her ninety-sixth ; 2 fatuous ; 2 
hisane; 1 bhnd; 1 deaf and dumb; 22 illegitimate children dur- 
ing- the last three years. 

The causes of the increase in the number of the population at 
different periods are various. The increase which took place be- 
tween 1755 and 1792, arose from the great facilities and encou- 
ragement given to feuing in the village. That occurring betwixt 
1811 and 1831, may be attributed to a decreet of the Court of 
Session, finding that the lands of Milrig and the village and lands 
of Sornhill did not belong to Galston, but to this parish. And 
that which has occurred since, may be assigned to the opening of 
new coal pits, and the erection of brick-works on different estates. 
And in consequence of another large coal-work having just com- 
menced, and an extensive cotton-printing establishment having 
been erected in the immediate neighbourhood, as well as from a 
new line of road having been lately opened, which offers a very fa- 
vourable opportunity for building,— there is every prospect of a 
rapid and large increase, especially in the village population. 

Habits and Character of the People.— The people are plain and 
unaffected in their manners, industrious in their habits, and on 
Sabbath and other holidays neatly and well-dressed ; their ordi- 
nary food simple, and when they are able to afford it, substantial. 
We doubt much whether they enjoy many of the comforts of life, 
especially those employed in manufactures, the wages earned beino- 
at best but small, while the untoward fluctuations in trade often 
expose them to much poverty. The country population is, in- 
deed, most respectable, the most of them being seemingly in easy 
circumstances ; they are steady and regular in their habits, atten- 
tive to religious ordinances, intelligent and well-principled. I am 
happy to bear testimony to the general good conduct of a very 
large class of the inhabitants. I mean the colliers. There are 
very many of them in comfortable circumstances— inhabiting their 
own houses, bringing up their families respectably, and seemingly 
surrounded with many comforts ; many of them intelligent and 
pious men, and several of them having family worship regularly in 
their houses. Indeed, I may almost say with confidence, what can 
be but seldom said of the same class of workmen, that they are 
among the most orderly, industrious, and intelligent of our pa- 
rishioners; and much of this is owing to the circumstances, that 
most of them are natives of the place, and that the different coal- 
proprietors are very careful in employing and encouraging only the 
best behaved.

IV. — Industry. 
Manvfaclures. — Hand-loom weaving is the chief branch of ma- 
nufacture carried on in the parish. The principal kinds of work 
done, are harness-shawls, plain-middles, and mousselin-de-laine- 
The work is got from Kilmarnock and Paisley. There are in the 
village between 40 and 50 families depending on the weaving, 94 
weavers, between 50 and 60 pirn-winders, 40 draw-boys. The 
wages of the first-class, 13s., deduct expenses, 4s., neat wages, 9s. ; 
second-cluss, 7s., deduct expenses. Is. 6d., neat wages, 5s. 6d. 
Draw-bovs receive from 2s. to 2s. 8d. per week ; pirn-winders, 
4d. to 8d. per day. We understand that the making of shoes 
for the foreign markets constituted at one time a very considera- 
ble branch of trade carried on here, but of late, from various 
causes, it has greatly declined, so that there is not above a dozen 
now employed in it in all the parish. 

A great proportion of the females in the parish are employed in 
sewing and embroidering muslin. Their wages vary from 9d. to 
3s. 6d. per week ; but this latter sum can only be earned at the 
best work, and by the most expert sewers, and at much ex- 
pense of comfort to themselves. The employment, we believe, is 
very injurious to the general health of those employed, but espe- 
cially to their chest and eyes. 

Agriculture.— T'ae parish contains about 18,000 acres, 500 of 
which are under wood, about 700 still in moss ; which last, how- 
ever, are yearly diminishing, as the different proprietors and far- 
mers connected with them are yearly making inroads upon them 
with tile-draining and the plough-share. The rest is under culti- 
vation. The rent of land varies from L. 1, 10s. to L. 3, lOs. per 
acre. ' The grazing of a cow or ox, L. 4. No sheep are grazed 
in the parish, excepting a few in the parks immediately surround- 
ing the different mansions of proprietors. The cows are chiefly 
of the true Ayrshire breed, and the horses used for labour are all 
mostly of the Clydesdale variety. 

Rate of Wages.— Farm-servants' wages yearly are from L. 12 to 
L. 16, with food; women's, from L. 7 to L. 10 ; labourers in sum- 
mer receive 12s.; in winter, 10s. . , 

7zry.— This is much attended to, and from its produce the 
..reater part of the rent in many cases is paid. Above 160 tons 
of cheese are produced annually. Other parishes may be better 
known for their dairy produce than this, but there are several in- 
dividuals in the parish whose cheese, with the other productions 



RICCARTON. 



613 



of their dairy, can bear comparison with any in the county. To 
the making of cheese the utmost attention seems to be paid, both 
as it regards the mode of its manufacture and the materials of 
which it is made. Cheese of the best quahty is selling at present 
about 12s. per stone, Dutch weight. The price is regarded as high. 

Husbandry. — Very great improvements are every year making in 
this province of industry, both from tile-draining, ditching, liming, 
enclosing, &amp;c. and should they continue to go forward for a series of 
years, the beneficial results both to landlord and tenant will be very 
considerable ; for while they will secure higher rents to the former, 
they will enable the latter, with much less difficulty and risk, from the 
improved quality of the crops and their greater certainty, notwith- 
standnig the variableness of climate and other uncontrollable contin- 
gencies, to pay them. By the furrow-draining, which is decidedly the 
greatest improvement, the land may be said to increase in value fully 
at an average about L. 1 per acre, of annual rental. The value of 
this improvement depends in individual cases upon several circum- 
stances, such as the nature of the ground drained, the width be- 
tween the drains, the size of the tiles used, &amp;c. However, almost in 
every case, the improvement is more or less felt. The amount of 
land drained in the parish annually, is upwards of 200 acres. The 
cost of draining an acre is about L. 6. If the proprietor does the 
whole, which sometimes happens, then the tenant pays in conside- 
ration 5s. per acre additional rent during his lease. This latter 
practice is not frequent with the landholders in this part, except 
with the Duke of Portland, who drains the most extensively ; but 
it IS thought by men of much experience that they overlook their 
own interest in not adopting it. 

The crops raised are oats, wheat, barley, potatoes, turnips. The 
usual rotation is, two or three years tillage, one hay, and five pasture. 
This order, however, is sometimes deviated from, according to the 
nature of the soil, &amp;c. 

The rental of the parish is supposed to amount to between 
L. 9O0O and L. 10,000 annually, and the gross rental arising 
from lands, coal and tile-works, may be stated at about L. 15,000° 
The average size of farms is eighty acres. The enclosures in the 
parish are good, formed almost solely of hedge-rows, and these 
very thriving. The farm-steadings on most of the properties are 
m good condition ; many of them have double storied dwelling- 
houses, with extensive and substantial offices. The houses are chief- 
ly thatched, but the larger and newer ones are almost all slated.

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The nearest town is Kilmarnock, which is distant only one mile 

from the village. 

Villages. Riccarton village contains nearly 1200 inhabitants. 

There are two other villages in the parish, viz. Hurlford and Sorn- 
hill. In the former, there is a population betwixt 300 and 400 
chiefly connected with different coal-works in the neighbourhood ; 
and in the latter and its neighbourhood, which is above six miles 
from Riccarton, the population is nearly 100. 

Means of Communication, -c— There are two post deliveries 
from Kilmarnock daily. There are three great lines of highway 
traversing the parish,— one from London to Glasgow,— another 
from Glasgow to Ayr and Portpatrick, which passes through the 
village,— and a third from Ayr to Edinburgh, which passes through 
the villages of Riccarton and Hurlford. These are kept in excel- 
lent order. The parish roads are likewise in tolerably good repair. 
Three stage-coaches, besides the Portpatrick mail, pass through 
the village from Glasgow to Ayr, and return daily. There is be- 
sides a coach which runs through the parish, and returns every day 
from Edinburgh and Ayr; one which runs from Glasgow to Dum- 
fries ; and a public omnibus betwixt Kilmarnock and Ayr. A 
private branch railway passes from the great coal-works at Ca- 
prington to the Kilmarnock and Troon railway. The great 
Western Railwav between London and Glasgow, now in contem- 
plation, is expected to cross the parish towards its eastern extremi- 
ty on the line to Kilmarnock. Should it be carried into execution, 
the advantage to the parish will be incalculable. 

Bridgcs.-Theve are three principal bridges all over the Irvine, 
two at the village of  Riccarton, and the other at Hurlford. One 
of those at Riccarton has been but lately built and on y opened 
last Whitsunday. It is very handsome and substantial. It has 
three skewed arches, thus forming the largest bridge of the kind 
in this county, if not in Scotland. The bridge itself, with the new 
line of road connected with it, forms a most convemcnt and beauu- 
ful outlet from Kilmarnock, as well as a decided improvement to 
the village. The old bridge, which stands about thirty yards up 
from the new one, is in good condition. The f'''J ''' 
Hurlford. It lately underwent very extensive alterations and re 
pairs, which have rendered it very spacious and substantial, 
smaller bridges in the parish are all m good order. 

Ecclesiastical State. -The parish originally was a chaplainiy be 



RICCARTON. 



615 



longing to Dundonald. Afterwards, it was given to the convent of 
Dalmulin, on the bank of the Ayr ; but upon the demoHtion of 
that religious house, it was transferred to the monks of Paisley, 
in whose hands it remained till the Reformation, while the duties 
of it were performed by a curate or chaplain, appointed by that 
monastery. After the Reformation, it was united to the parish of 
Craigie, and continued so till its final disjunction in 1648. In 
1621, the whole tithes belonged to the Earl of Abercorn. The 
patronage, too, was in his hands ; but soon afterwards it was con- 
ferred upon the family of Caprington, who have continued to ex- 
ercise it ever since. It is one of the best endowed parishes in the 
county. The present incumbent is the sixth minister since the 
Revolution. 

Church. — The present church was built in 1823, but not on 
the site of the former one, which was in the burying-ground. It 
is erected on a mound in the middle of the village, partly natu- 
ral and partly artificial, and which was formerly called " Seat 
of Judgment," having been, it is supposed, one of those court 
hills where justice was administered and executed in ancient 
times. It is a plain square building, of no particular style of ar- 
chitecture, but very substantial and commodious, and alike com- 
fortable 4oth for speaker and hearer. It is ornamented with a 
handsome spire and clock, and, as it stands on a considerable emi- 
nence, it forms a conspicuous object in the landscape. It cost, in- 
cluding every expense, about L.4000. It might contain, allowing 
eighteen inches for each, 1192 sittings; but by the sheriff's de- 
creet, it is allocated for little more than 1000. The rest includes 
table-seats, &amp;c. which are all free sittings. The situation of the 
church is rather awkward, being nearly six miles from the one end 
of the parish, and two from the other ; but still it is not inconve- 
niently for the great bulk of the inhabitants ; the greater propor- 
tion of them being within a mile and a half distant, and nearly the 
one-half being closely adjacent to it. The system of seat-letting 
is not common, — such seats as are let, except a few, being let at 
only a nominal price. 

Munse. — The manse and office-houses were built between 
forty and fifty years ago. Upon the entrance of the present in- 
cumbent in 1837, they underwent some repairs, which have ren- 
dered them very comfortable. The glebe, including garden, 
stance of house, &amp;c, is about 8 acres in extent. Naturally, the soil 
is good, lut, being in bad condition, it would not rent at present 



516 AYUSHIIIK. 

above L. 2, 10s. an acre. The garden contains about an acre, and 
is well enclosed on two sides by a high and substantial wall, lately 
built at the sole expense of the heritors. The stipend, as de- 
creed by the Court in 1811, consists of 111 bolls, 1 firlot, I peck, 
1 lippy meal, 77 bolls, 3 fi riots, 1 peck, flippy barley, with 
L. 60, 3s. 8d. in money, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. for conamunion elements. 

There is no Dissenting place of worship in the parish. About 
forty years ago a chapel in connection with the Relief body was 
erected in the village ; but it has long since been pulled down. 
The parish church is well attended. The number of communi- 
cants on last sacramental occasion was between 600 and 700, those 
who communicated for the first time amounting to 120. The sacra- 
ment of the Lord's Supper has hitherto been dispensed only once 
a-year ; but arrangements have now been made for its dispensation 
twice a-year. The number of individuals belonging to the Esta- 
blished Church, when last ascertained, was 2410; to other deno- 
minations, including United Secession, Relief, Old Light, Came- 
ronians, or Macmillanites, Independents, Baptists, Methodists, 
Episcopalians, and Roman Catholics, 304. 

Education.— There are three schools in the parish, attended by 
upwards of 250 scholars. The average attendance at the parish 
school is 100. The branches taught are, English reading, spel- 
ling, and grammar, arithmetic, writing and book-keeping, Latin, 
Greek, and French. The fees per quarter are the following: for 
English reading, 3s.; reading and writing, 3s. 6d., with arithmetic, 
4s.; book-keeping, 6s.; Latin, 7s. 6d., with Greek, 10s. Gene- 
rally about one-half are taught reading only; the rest receive 
ihe'various other branches above specified. The schoolmaster has 
the maximum salary. The average amount of fees annually is 
L.50. He enjoys other small salaries and perquisites, as session, 
heritor's clerk, &amp;c. One of the other schools is in the village, at- 
tended by about 100 scholars. The other is at Hurlford, attended 
by about 50 scholars ; and to this are attached a free house and 
oarden. The house was built by subscription, and the ground was 
given by the Duke of Portland. The teacher has no income m- 
dependent of his fees. Nothing but the ordinary branches are 
taught in these private schools. A school of industry for females, 
and an infant school are both very much needed in the parish. 
There are two Sabbath schools, one in the village of Riccarton, 
and the other at Hurlford ; they are attended by about 180 scho 
lars, and are both under the superintendence of the minister.

Libraries. — There is only one public library in the parish ; it 
contains more than 400 volumes. The books are select, and 
chiefly historical, biographical, and religious. It is open to all the 
parish who comply with the prescribed regulations, and those chil- 
dren who attend the Sabbath evening classes, and who are above 
thirteen years of age, have the use of the books gratis. It has 
just been opened, and has about 120 readers, who, with the ex- 
ceptions mentioned above, pay 2d. per month each ; no entry 
money. 

Friendly Societies, §-c. — In the parish, there are at present four 
friendly societies. • The Benevohnt. Society, instituted in 1807, 
with 60 members, weekly subscription, 2d. each ; aliment when 
bed-ridden, 5s. weekly ; aliment when walking about, 3s. ; funeral 
allowance, 6d. from each member ; annual income, L.26 ; expen- 
diture annually, L. 18; surplus fund, L.70. The Friendship So- 
ciety, instituteil in 1804, with 53 members, weekly subscription, 
2d. each when needed ; aliment when confined to bed, 5s. weekly ; 
when able to walk about, 2s. 6d. weekly ; funeral allowance, 6d. 
from each member; annual income, L. 16, 13s. 3d.; annual out- 
lay, L. 16, 12s. lOd. ; surplus funds, L.55, 6s. ld. Munijicent 
Friendly Society, instituted in 1815, with 174 members; weekly 
subscription, 2d. each : when confined to bed, 5s.; when able to 
walk about, 3s. ; funeral allowance, 6d. from each member, and 
as much from the funds as make L.5 ; annual income, L.72, 8s. 
7d. ; disbursements, L.51, 18s. 51.; surplus funds, L.300 at in- 
terest. There is another Society for the workmen employed in 
Caprington coal-works, called " Caprington Benevolent Society," 
instituted in 1836. All belonging to the coal- works between 
fifteen and forty -five may enter as members. It has 100 members, 
who pay ld. weekly; each member has 4s. per week, if unable 
to work; L.l, 10s. is allowed for funeral expenses; annual in- 
come, L.21 ; surplus fund, L. 50, L. 40 of which lie at interest. 
All fines, dues, and entries are devoted to the funds, and the pro- 
prietor gives L. 10 annually. There is also an Association con- 
nected with these coal-works, to assist in defraying the funeral ex- 
penses of its members and their families; L. 2, 10s. are allowed 
for a member; L. 1, 10s. for his wife ; L. 1 for a child. Each 
pays a sum according as it is required. 

There is a Temperance Society in the village with 35 mem- 
bers, and a juvenile branch with 12. There is also an Associa-. 
tion, called the Working Men's Association, for political purposes.

We regret that there is, at present, no Society for missionary 
or religious purposes, and, so far as we have learned, there never 
has been. A prayer meeting was held for many years in the vil- 
lage, but has been discontinued. We hope, however, to have 
others of a similar nature speedily commenced. 

Poor.— The average number of paupers has, of late years, been ■ 

about 30 ; the number upon the occasional list is rather more. 

The average amount of aliment yearly is L. 6, lowest, L. 1, 5s.; 
average allowance monthly, 6s. 6d. There are two insane persons 
who receive each L. 14 annually. The assessment of the heritors 
is voluntary, and amounts to L. 150 per annum; collections at 
church doors, L. 48 ; the sums arising from proclamation and 
mortcloth dues, L, 5 : in all L. 200. But out of this fund are 
paid the salaries of the precentor, beadle, and the person employ- 
ed in cleaning the church, as well as any small repairs upon 
the church, manse, and school- house. Besides these disburse- 
ments to the poor, there are between seventy and eighty cart-loads 
of coal given to them annually by a few of the proprietors, and 
which the farmers in the neighbourhood drive gratuitously. 

Inns, Alehouses. — There are 18 of such houses in the parish, 
which, considering its neighbourhood to Kilmarnock, are far too 
many for any good or useful purpose. 

Fuel. — Coal is the only fuel in use, and it is got at very reason- 
able prices. The price of the fire-coal at the pit-mouth, at pre- 
sent, varies from 5s. to 6s. per imperial ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
Many changes have taken place in the parish since the last 
Statistical Account was drawn up in 1792, and many of them de- 
cided improvements. The people seem more intelligent ; their 
wages are much higher, in some cases doubled ; their comforts 
upon the whole greater. From the tile-draining the land has sin- 
gularly improved, being, in consequence, now able to produce 
much better crops, and with greater certainty, than before. A 
considerable quantity of moss has been rendered arable since that 
time, there being now only about 70 acres in that state, whereas 
then there were 250. Instances of longevity seem now to be more 
numerous than formerly ; and the population has nearly trebled. 
On most properties, the farm- steadings have been much improved; 
and the facilities of communication of every kind are now much 
more numerous. Church accommodation has been greatly in- 
creased ; education is carried on with greater spirit, and th'e bran-

clies taught are more varied. It is only in the reHgious and moral 
habits ot the people that I fear there has been no corresponding- 
advancement.

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Extent, 4-c.— The parish is upwards of four miles in length, and 
where its width is greatest, it is nearly two miles broad. On the 
east and south-east, it is divided from the parish of Dreghorn by 
the river Annick. It is divided from Kilwinning, on the west, by 
the Garnock ; and on the north-west, by a small stream called the 
Redburn. On the south, the river Irvine separates it from the 
parish of Dundonald; and on the north, it is bounded by the pa- 
rish of Stewarton. 

The parish abounds in seams of coal. Good building stone is 
found in various districts ; more especially, there is an extensive 
quarry near the town, which has long been famed for the supply 
which it affords of very superior oven soles. 

II. — Civil History. 

Xown. — Irvine, formerly written Irwyn and.Irwine, is beautifully 
situated on the north bank of the river Irvine, and not far from the 
confluence of the Irvine and the Garnock. By the river from 
which it takes its name, it is separated, as already stated, from the 
parish of Dundonald. But although the ancient burgh is so se- 
parated, the extended or parliamentary burgh embraces a portion 
of the parish of Dundonald. In this portion, are the mouth and 
the harbour of the river Irvine. Before the harbour of Port- Glas- 
gow was erected, Irvine was the place to which were brought the 
goods imported by the merchants of Glasgow. In a work publish- 
ed in 1620, and entitled " Timothy Font's Cunningham Topogra- 

 Compiled by the incumbent, the Rev. John Wilson, from communications made 
by J. W. MaL-kfuzie, Esq. ; Robert Montgomerie, Esq. ; James Johnstone, Esq. ;

phized," this harbour is called « the chiefF porta of ye country of 
Cunningham. The porte and harbry being now much decayed 
from qwhat it was anciently, being stopt with shelves of Sand which 
hinder the neir approach of shipping." 

As appears from the map which accompanies Pontes work, the con- 
fluence of the rivers Irvine and Garnock had' not taken place at 
the lime to which it refers, for he describes the Garnock as emp- 
tying itself into the sea, about two miles from the mouth of the 
river Irvine. Indeed, long subsequent to Font's time, the sea came 
up close to the town, and vessels were loaded and discharged at 
what was then and is now termed the Seagate. Within the me- 
mory of persons now alive, the sea has receded considerably on this 
coast; and very considerably since 1620, for the lower part of the 
Seagate is now nearly half a mile from the sea. Some time sub- 
sequent to the period at which Pont wrote, Thomas Tucker pub- 
lished a report in 1056 upon the settlement of the revenues and 
customs in Scotland. He had 'been sent by the government of 
England, for the purpose of introducing order into the collection 
of the revenues of the excise and customs, and was appointed one 
of the commissioners of the Scottish board. The district concern- 
ing which he was to report, consisted of " Glasgow, Newarke, Green- 
ocke, Fairly, Culburgh, Saltcoates, Bute, and lastly, Irwyn." " Ir- 
wyn," says he, " a small burgh towne lying at the mouth of a river 
of the same name, which hath some time been a pretty small port, 
but at present clogged and almost choaked up with sand, which 
the western sea beats into it, soe as it wrestles for life to main- 
taine a small trade to France, Norway, and Ireland, with herring 
and other goods, brought on horseback from Glasgow, for the 
purchasing timber, wine, and other commodities to supply theyr 
occasions with. The vessels belonging to this district are, viz. To 
Glasgowe, 12, viz. 3 of 150 tons; 1 of 140 ; 2 of 100 ; 1 of 50 ; 
3 of 30 ; 1 of 15 : I of 12. — Renfrew, 3 or 4 boates of five or six 
tonnes a piece. Irwin, 3 or 4, the biggest not exceeding sixteen 
tonnes." 

This report by Tucker exhibits the state of trade as very small 
and confined, in 1656; but about the beginning of the last cen- 
tury, it appears to have increased very considerably — as there were 
1618 barrels of herrings exported in the year 1715, the bounty al- 
lowed on which amounted to L.843, and in the year 1720 there 
were 107,533 pounds of tobacco exported, the drawback of duty 
on which amounted to L.2550. About this period, and for a good

iwany years afterwards, smuggling appears to have been carried on 
very extensively and in a very daring manner. It appears by the 
custom-house books at Irvine, that the custom-house there was re- 
peatedly broken into and robbed of large quantities of seized 
goods by bands of armed men, and that several people in the bet- 
ter ranks of life were concerned in these lawless proceedings. 
Latterly smuggling was chiefly confined to whisky from Arran ; 
but of late years, this illicit traffic has almost entirely ceased. 
According to the official returns published by Chalmers in his 
Caledonia, Irvine was the third port in Scotland in the year 
1760. Port- Glasgow, including, as it then did, Greenock and 
Glasgow, was first, and Leith second, in the importance aris- 
ing from the number and tonnage of vessels. In Leith at that 
period, there were 79 ; whilst in Irvine, there were 77 vessels. 
The subsequent increase of trade has been very considerable. 
At the present day, all vessels belonging to the coast of Ayr- 
shire, from Troon point to Largs, inclusive of Saltcoats and Ar- 
drossan, and all vessels belonging to Arran, are comprehended 
within the port of Irvine. Of these vessels, by far the greatest 
number belong to ship-owners resident in Irvine, who employ them 
in carrying coals chiefly coastwise and to Ireland, but not unfre- 
quently to France, Malta, Gibraltar, and other places in foreign 
countries. The imports consist of timber chiefly, but occasional- 
ly of grain from America, and of grain £nd butter from Ireland 
in great quantities. The timber from America yields the great- 
est part of the revenue of the customs, and the average amount 
may be stated at L. 2700 annually. The coals exported from the 
port and district exceed 276,000 tons annually. The number of 
vessels belonging to the Port is 118; their tonnage amounts to 
15,756 ; and they are navigated by 958 men. 

Irvine ranks amongst the most ancient of the royal burghs of 
Scotland. In a charter granted by King Robert in 1308, it is 
mentioned as a place of great antiquity. In a subsequent charter 
granted 1323, there is reference to a charter in favour of this burgh, 
granted in the reign of Alexander II., early in the thirteenth cen- 
tury. The antiquity of the burgh and its importance in ancient 
times, are also evident from a charter by King Robert II., 
dated 8th April 1372. This charter bears to have proceeded on 
" an inquest at the King's command, concerning a dispute between 
Ayre and Irwine, anent their boundaries and liberties, &amp;c. and by 
yhich it was clearly found, that, time immemorial, Irvine had been 



G22 



AYKSHIRR. 



in possession of the whole barony of Cunuhigham and of the ba« 
rony of Larg'ys, annexed to the liberties of the said burgh, pro suis 

tarn mercandisis et mercirnoniis in eisdem lihere exercendis, as 

was clearly established by charters of his Majesty's predecessors 
shDwn in inquest, &amp;c." From these and other documents, it also 
appears that the jurisdiction of the magistrates of this burgh ex- 
tended formerly over a wide territory ; and embraced even crimes 
of a capital nature. The burgh records contain accounts of nu- 
merous justiciary courts held in the burgh, for trial of capital 
cnmes. Among others, may be mentioned a justiciary court, of 
which there is a full detail, held at Irvine, 20th October 1625, 
" per Allanum Dunlop urbis praefectum dicti biirgi," for " trial of 
Alexander Banks, sone of Robert Banks, flesher, for the slaughter 
of Gilbert M'Alister, beilland man, slain in Stevenston yesterday, 
and brought in by the Earl of Eglinton, as baillie of Cunningham, 
and repledge it from his court to the jurisdiction of this burgh as 
ane of yair inhabitants." 

Generally speaking, the peculiar and distinctive power of local 
magistrates was restricted almost insensibly, as the laws of the 
country were consolidated, and administered on more comprehen- 
sive principles. Of this fact, there is a striking exemplification in 
a case reported by Fountainhall, as to the trial of certain mer- 
chants in Irvine in the year 1712. 

It had been the practice of the Irvine merchants to smuggle 
Irish corn, stealing it in by night, " at many secret creeks on the 
shore." Thomas Gray, merchant in Irvine, and others, were di- 
lated before the justices as criminals for this offence, and for their 
contumacy in not appearing, were fined in L. 100 Sterling each, 
under the penal statutes against the importing of Irish meal. 
Gray suspended, and stated various important pleas: \st. That 
the burgesses of Irvine were not subject to the jurisdiction of the 
county justices, and that the magistrates had the power of repledg- 
ing them. This plea was repelled, and the right of repledging 
found to be in desuetude. Id, That it was not competent to refer 
the fact on which the charge rested, to the oathof party. This 
was also repelled, and the court found it provable by oath, as well 
as usury and the like. 3c, That the fine was most exorbitant. 
The court found that the offenders should not be all classed alike, 
for one who had only brought in a boll or two was not to be so 
deeply fined, as he who had brought ui an hundred, and had re- 
iterated his transgression, and a poor man's fine was not by Magna 



IRVINE. 



Charta to be so great as a rich and wealthy transgressor's, — there- 
fore the Lords reponed them to their oaths, and prorogated the 
diet, and allowed the ordinary to consider the quality and frequency 
of the transgression, with the circumstance, condition, and the 
ability of the party, and accordingly to modify and adjust the fine 
as he saw fit. Says Fountainhall in the conclusion of his report, 
" This importation of meal is good for the poor, plenty making it 
cheap, but it sinks the gentlemen's rents in these western shires ; 
which of the two is the greater prejudice to the bulk of the na- 
tion, problema esto Where we must likewise balance the loss and 
damage we suffer by the exporting so much of our money in specie 
to a foreign country to buy it, which diminishes our own, pi-o tanto. 
But if the victual was purchased in Ireland by exchange of our goods 
given for it, that takes away that objection, founded on the export- 
ing our money." Boswell v. Gray, 29th January 1712, Mor. Diet, 
p. 9398. 

The revenue of the burgh is derived chiefly from landed property. 
In the year 1697, it amounted to L. 1557, 2s. 7d. Scots, and the ex- 
penditure to L. 1431, 6s. 7d. Scots. In the year 1840, 'the revenue 
amounted to L. 1675, 6s. lid. Sterling, and the expenditure to 
L. 1567, 15s. 4d. Sterling. The sources in which the revenue 
of the burgh originated are distinctly pointed out in several char- 
ters. In some measure, these sources have been dried up ; but to 
what extent or by what means, it is not easy to determine. There 
is a charter in favour of the burgh, dated 8th June 1572, by King 
James VI., in which he grants to the said burgh, all revenues belong- 
ing to churchmen within the territory of the burgh, for the purpose of 
erecting a[school in Irvine. In this charter, he refers to annual-rents 
levied from certain farms, also to tenements, orchards, gardens, crofts, 
fruits, and duties; but of the value of these grants, no definite es- 
timate can be formed. These, all and sundry, were united and incor- 
porated, as ordained by James in terms of this charter, " henceforth 
and hereafter to be called Our foundation of the school of Irvine.'' 
Such was the destination of the revenues belonging to churchmen, 
and more especially to the Carmelite friars, within the territory of 
the burgh. What was formerly done in fulfilment of this design 
does not appear from any known documents ; but in part payment 
of an academy built by subscription in Irvine, at the expense of 
L. 2100 Sterling, and having a royal charter, money has lately 
been expended by the burgh to the amount of L. 1633, 4s. 6d. 
Salaries for the encouragement of teachers in this academy are

also paid, annually, out of the same funds. Besides, this yearly 
expenditure is increased by the burden innposed on the town, 
of defraying the charges for occasional repairs of the building. 
Apart altogether from what remains of the possessions belonging 
in the olden time to the Carmelite friars, — the town has other 
property and other sources of income, to which'references are made 
in the charters, and more especially in the charter granted by 
James VI., dated 1st May 1601. 

The situation of the town is not only beautiful but very salubri- 
ous, andpresents in every respect a most desirable place of residence. 
With the exception of an assessment of a very limited amount, for 
the support of the poor, there is not a local burden. The main 
street is wide, well-causewayed, clean, and handsome. Through- 
out the town, the houses, generally speaking, are excellent and 
commodious : in the suburbs, there are several well-built villas ; 
and in the immediate vicinity, there are sites eligible in the high- 
est degree for building. Now that communication by steam-car- 
riages, with Paisley and Greenock and Port- Glasgow and Glas- 
gow, is both frequent and rapid, parents may easily avail them- 
selves of the advantages afforded here for the satisfactory and in- 
deed complete instruction of their children in every branch of clas- 
sical, commercial, and ornamental education. Doubtless, the 
communication so happily opened up will bring these advantages 
under the consideration of many, so as to induce them either to 
settle with their families in Irvine, or board their children under 
the care of one or other of our accomplished and efficient teachers. 

Among the principal buildings, the Academy deservedly claims 
the first notice. This large and elegant edifice was built in the 
year 1816, It contains seven very commodious apartments, and 
stands in a fine open and well-aired situation. The teachers are 
three in number, and all the chief branches of education are 
tauo-ht. There are, besides, various private educational establish- 
ments in the nrgh. The present parish church may next be no- 
ticed : a large and well-proportioned building, erected in the 
year 1774, with an elegant spire attached. The church is esti- 
mated to contain 1800 sitters. The patronage is vested in the 
Earl of Egllnton, There are also congregations in Irvine in con- 
nection wi'th the Relief, the Associated Synod, and the Baptists. 

The Town-house was built in 1745. Besides court hall and 
council chambers, it contains two rooms formerly used for civil 
debtors, and three apartments for criminals, with polii-e-office,

shop, and public library. The debtor's prison has this year 1840, 
been discontinued in consequence of the New Prison Act; and 
the only jail in the county for civil debtors is now at Ayr. Cri- 
minals are seldom confined in this jail beyond a few days ; when 
longer imprisonment is found necessary, they are usually trans- 
mitted to Ayr. 

A Saving's Bank was instituted in Irvine in the year 1815, and 
such has been the rapid progress of this excellent institution, 
that, in the year 1839, the sums deposited amounted to no less 
than L. 1050 Sterling. The depositors consist mostly of indus- 
trious mechanics and servants. 

In ancient times, there was a magnificent market-cross in the 
centre of the town, but it was taken down in the year 1694. The 
principal stones of that edifice were applied in the erection of the 
present meal-market in 1694 and 1695. 

There were also two ports or great entrance gates into the 
town, the one extending across High Street from the west end of 
the Glasgow Vennel ; and the other across the street called Eglin- 
ton Street, near to the house now belonging to James Allan, 
weaver. 

Irvine appears to have been visited by a severe plague in 1546j 
in which year a commission was granted by Queen Mary, with 
consent of the Earl of Arran, her tutor and protector, and gover- 
nor of the kingdom, to the magistrates of this burgh, granting to 
them very extensive powers for enforcing the necessary regulations 
as fully as could be done by the Lord Justice- General. 

The present bridge of Irvine, across Irvine water, was built in 
1745-6, by Thomas Brown, at the contract price of L. 350 Sterling; 
it was materially widened and improved in the year 1827, under 
authority of an act of Parliament. 

The town is well lighted with gas, from a work erected by pub- 
lic subscription in 1827. 

" The Seagate Castle," says Robertson in his Topographical 
Account of Cunningham, " is a ruinous fabric of considerable anti- 
quity. It belongs to the Earl of Eglinton, and is supposed to 
have been intended as the jointure-house of the Dowager Ladies 
of that family. There is no date upon it ; but, from the circum- 
stance of the united arms of Montgomery and Eglinton being en- 
graved upon a central stone, in a vaulted chamber in the lower 
story, it must have been built since the union of these two fami- 
lies by marriage in 1361 ; and that it could not be much later

than that period, may be inferred from its structure as a house 
of defence, in which are many arrow-slits for bows, but no gun-ports 
for cannon or other fire-arms, which were introduced into Scotland 
about nearly the same era, and were never omitted in fortified 
places erected after that time. In this old castle there remains 
still quite entire, one of the most perfect specimens of the Saxon 
or Norman round arch, that is perhaps now to be met with in 
Britain. It is erected oyer the principal gateway into the house. 
A square tower, in one of the corners, is evidently much more an- 
cient, as may be concluded not only from the style of the building, 
but from the stone being greatly more decayed from the action of 
the weather." 

The present Parliamentary constituency of the burgh is 258 ; 
and the muncipal constituency of that part of the burgh within 
the royalty is 182. 

The municipal government of the burgh is vested in a Provost, 
two Bailies, Dean of Guild, Treasurer, and twelve Councillors. 
There are six incorporations of trades, holding under charters or 
seals of cause from the magistrates and council, viz. squaremen, 
hammermen, coopers, tailors, shoemakers, and weavers. At pre- 
sent the numbers of the different trades may be computed as 
follows: — Squaremen, about 94; hammermen, 32; shoemakers, 
37 ; tailors, 30 ; coopers, 4 ; weavers, 300. 

The principal inns are the Eglinton Arm's Inn and the Queen's , 
Arm's Inn. There are three annual fairs in Irvine, — first Wednes- 
day of January for horses ; first Tuesday of May for cows ; third 
Monday and third Wednesday of August for horses. 

The number of hand-loom weavers in the town and parish of 
Irvine is about 400. Their earnings vary according to their re- 
spective abilities and steadiness ; but the following statement may 
be viewed as a fair calculation : — 



100 employed, earn weekly . L. 0 5 0 each.

There may be about 200 females employed in winding weft or 
preparing it for the weaver, and the earnings of this class may 
average 6d. per day, or 3s. per week. The number of females 



iiiviNE. 627 

engaged in ornamental needle-work, may amount to nearly 2000. 

While learning their art, these persons make very little, but when 

they become expert workers, they will earn from lOd. to Is. 4d. 

per day; and the length of their day, in general, is from seven in 

the morning to eleven or twelve at night. 

Eminent Men. — The celebrated Mr Dickson, to be after men 

tioned as minister of Irvine, was a poet ; and, among other poems, 

he published the hymn, well known under the title of " O Mother 
dear Jerusalem." But, a poet of higher genius and greater name, 
is also claimed by Irvine as one of her sons, — James Montgomerie 
of Sheffield. At the period of his birth in " the Half-way," the 
street so called was part of the suburbs of the royal burgh of Ir- 
vine, and was held as part of the parish quoad sacra ; and although 
the district referred to is now a distinct parish in these respects, 
it lies within the parliamentary burgh as now constituted. Irate- 
ly, when on a visit to his native place, Mr Montgomerie was pub- 
licly received, and entertained with every possible demonstration 
of respect by the magistrates and inhabitants. At the time of his 
birth, his father held the pastorate over a small section of the 
Moravian Church, assembling in a chapel within the Half-way of 
Irvine. 

Over this burgh the celebrated Robert Barclay presided as pro- 
vost ; and in the reign of Charles L, he was one of the Commis- 
sioners to the English parliament. 

In Irvine were also born the late John Gait, Esq. well known 
as an author of considerable popularity ; and the Right Honour- 
able David Boyle, at present the distinguished head of the Court 
of Session.

2914 9 0 acres. 3673 0 0 acres- 

The rental of arable lands in the parish amounts to L. 5273, 
which gives per imperial acre L.l, 15s. 

There are some inclosures let as high as L. 6, 6s. per imperial 
acre. The general rate of small inclosures near the burgh is from 
L. 4 to L.5 per imperial acre. The rate at which farms are let per 
acre, varies from L. 2 to L. 3, 15s. according to quality of soil. 

The lands are all let for a fixed sum per annum, and all on leases 
for nineteen years. 

The tenant, in most cases, pays all public burdens, excepting 
cess and minister's stipend. 

There is but a very small portion of land in the parish let ex-

clusively for pasture, and what is let is generally let about L. 4 
per acre. The land described as unfit for crop consists mostly 
of drifting sand, and affords a very scanty pasture for a few cows. 
All the other land in the parish is arable, and has been under 
crop. The soil in the most part of the parish is light sand ; towards 
the middle, it is of a sandy loam, and towards the higher ornorth- 
east, it is a heavy clay; on the whole, it is fit for any kind of crop. 

Produce. — The annual amount of produce may average about 
3550 quarters of grain, 25,900 stones of hay, and 3440 bolls of 
potatoes, besides turnips, &amp;c. There are from 40 to 50 men and 
as many women employed in agriculture, with about 60 horses. 
The number of dairy cows in the parish is about 370. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Irvine is an oblong square 
of 80 feet in length, and 60 in breadth. There is an elegant 
steeple attached to it ; and the interior was fitted up for the ac- 
commodation of 1800 sitters. It was built in 1774; and it un- 
derwent a great repair in 1830. Around it, there is a large bury- 
ing-ground; and a field, between it and the river, is in the pos- 
session of the heritors, which they intend to annex to the church- 
yard, when it becomes necessary to do so. No part of the bury- 
ing- ground is held as the property of private individuals. The tomb- 
stones of several eminent persons distinguish this burying-ground : 
and of these may be mentioned the tombstones of Mr Alexander 
Nisbet, Mr William M'Knight, and Dr Richmond ; and that also 
of James Blackwood and John M'CouU, who were hanged in 
1666, by sentence of the Commission which tried those who were 
engaged in the affair at Pentland. 

Among these tomb-stones there is one erected to John Peebles 
of Broomlands, Provost of Irvine, who died in 1596 ; and there 
are several others nearly as early. 

Originally, the church of Irvine belonged to the monastery of 
Kilwinning : and at the time of the Reformation, the vicarage was 
held by Thomas Andrew, by whom its value was stated at 200 
merks yearly- "The first Presbyterian minister of Irvine, Mr 
Thomas Young, was inducted in 1570. He was succeeded by 
Mr Alexander Scrimseour in 1598; and in 1610 he and several 
of his brethren were charged by the Lords of Secret Council with 
the crime of harbouring " John Campell alias Fadder Christos- 
tome, ane known trafficquing priest." Mr Scrimseour in 1618 was 
succeeded by Mr Dickson, who was deprived of his office by the

AYRSHIUE. 



Court of High Commission; but was afterwards restored through 
the influence of Alexander the Sixth Earl of Eglinton. Mr Dick- 
son was translated, and became Professor of Divinity, first at 
Glasgow, and subsequently at Edinburgh, where he died in 1662. 
His place as minister of Irvine was filled by Mr Alexander Nis- 
bet, whose character is well stated in his epitaph, as written by 
one of his brethren in these words : — " Grande aliquid vultu 
nituit, gressuque docoro ; grandius in magni dotibus ingenii." — 
After Mr Nisbet, Mr George Hutchison became minister of Ir- 
vine. Not giving obedience to his bishop, he was first silenced by 
the Parliament in 1662, and subsequently, in the same year, be 
was banished from Edinburgh ; but, upon their passing the act of 
indulgence, he was authorized by the Privy-Council, in 1669, to 
exercise the ministry at Irvine, where he died. Contemporaneously 
with Messrs Dickson, Nisbet, and Hutchison, Mr James Fergu- 
son was minister of the adjoining parish of Kilwinning, and in 
conjunction with these emirfent individuals, he formed the desigti 
of publishing brief expositions of the Scriptures. In part, this 
plan was carried into effect. Mr Dickson, inter alia, published his 
" Expositio Analytica omnium Apostolicarum Epistolarum." Mr 
Nisbet published an exposition of the two epistles of Peter, and 
also an Exposition of Ecclesiastes. From the pen of Mr Hutchi- 
son, the public received an expositiorl of the Book of Job, of the 
Minor Prophets, and of the Gospel according to the Evangelist 
John. " By all this, it appears," says Mr Patrick Warner, " that 
the people of Irvine had a long and clear day of the Gospel 
among them,"—" and," adds he, " I beg prayer in their behalf, 
lest, because of their barrenness, the kingdom of God should be 
taken from them." 

At the time when he wrote the sentences now quoted, Mr Pa- 
trick Warner was minister of Irvine, having succeeded Mr Hut- 
chison in 1688. The tone of these sentences seems to indicate 
the existence of an unfavourable impression on his mind, as to the 
misimprovement of their privileges on the part of his people. At 
all events, we know that Mr Warner met with great discourage- 
ments from them in the prosecution of his ministry. Greatly op- 
pressed by these discouragements, he submitted the reasons of de- 
mission to the presbytery of Irvine in 1702. 

• The reasons of demission were the following : .... p.»,:„„„ 
- It is not unknown to many in this presbyterie howhoavie the •'■•yg"''''""- 
grcgation hath bein to me for a long tyme, and what reasons I have to give ui a d.- 



IRVINE. 



631 



Imperfect when compared with the result to be desired, and 
even with the result of Christianity in our day, was the state of 

mission thereof, which also I have some tyrae offered, but hitherto have not beiri 

taken off my hand ; and now I am therefore constrained more earnestlie to presse 

the same for these reasons following : — 

I, I never was legallie settled minister of Irving, having entered amongst them 
before our legall settlement, to preach only in a meeting-house to so many as then 
called me, which I then looked upon to be only for ane interim, and did not expect 
the libertie wee then had would have continued above a year or two ; and if I had 
thought it would have been of longer continowance, would never have undertaken so 
heavie a charge. 

2d, My acceptance even of that call was upon condition and assurance given me 
that 1 should have a helper for which 1 refer to the records of the presbyterie, ane 
extract whereof is herewith produced. But that condition not having been fulfilled 
during the whole space of fourteen years though they have now the legale stipend of 
which they had no prospect when that promise was made I am no more bound by 
my acceptance of that call, which was but for ane interim, and upon that condition. 

3d, Having latelie perused the call given, I find more than the one-half of these 
who subscribed it either dead or removed out of the place, and near the one half the 
whole families removed, s.o as neither they nor any of their posterity to be found in 
the place. 

4lh, Others are come or brought into their roume, the outcasts of all the parishes 
about, and some from very remote places, either altogether without testimonialls, or 
bringing very lame ones, and though I have bein for many years complaining of 
this to the magistrates, yet hitherto have had little or no redresse at all. But, on the 
contrary, they have received such as burgesses, whom the session unanimouslie voted 
should not be received as members of the congregation, so that a relation of pastor 
and people is made up between me and a great many of the presentinhabitants of 
Irving by meer force and compulsion, without allowing me the libertie of giving my 
consent-thereto, which yet 1 conceive is necessary to make up that relation. 

5ih, My hands are not strengthened in the suppressing of sin and wickedness; 
but these too much encouraged by connivance and other wayes. 

6/j, I am now aged above 60, my strength decayed, and my voice too weak for so 
numerous a coogregatione. 

1th, T am not willing to mention other grievances'; some of them are known to 
this presbyterie. But, in short, animosities are come to so great a height though I 
hope I can vindicate myself as having given no just provocation thereto, that neither 
can I expect that the Gospel will be received kindly off my hand by some, nor have 
I the freedom to administer the sacrament of the Lord's Supper amongst them while 
these remain ; yea my hands are much weakened in preaching of the Gospel. 

To these reasons I crave libertie to add more, if neid be. And, in the meantime, do 
not presse this presbyterie to any inorderly procedure in the afiFair, but allow them to 
intimate to the congregation, that I have here given in such reasons for the presby- 
terie's acceptance of my demission, and require them to give in their answers there- 
to, if they have any, against the next presbyterie day. But withall, earnestlie obtest 
the presbyterie to do me justice, when they have considered how weighty and rele- 
vant my reasons are. 28th July 1702." 

Accordingly, in February 1703, as we learn from the manuscript sermons of Mr 
Reid, minister of Stevenston, he declared the church vacant by appointment of pres- 
bytery. The following passage from the discourse which he preached in the church 
of Irvine, on the occasion to which reference is now made, may be quoted as giving 
a view of the actual state of religion in this country at that time. 

" How few now-a-days esteem ministers in love for their work's sake  how many lie at 
the catch, and wait for their halting  what unjust reproaches and aspersions are they 
many times loaded with ; and, how readily are the enemies of a minister believed, 
even by the bulk of professors  Talk of him what you will, how are his proceedings 
and conduct misconstructed  What discouragements of this sort does your present 
minister labour under, owing partly, from tlie unaccountable ignorance and weakness 
of some ; partly, from the enmity and malice of others ; but chiefly from that decay 
in religion and love to it that the most part of professors are lying under. And here, 
sirs, I cannot but take notice of the little love and esteem some of you, at least, in this

religious knowledge and yractice in the days to which we have now 
referred. Both among the laity and the clergy, superstition was 
prevalent to an extraordinary and lamentable extent. Their loud- 
est and most plaintive wailings were raised against the sin of 
witchcraft, so that about the period of which we have been writ- 
ing, persons suspected of it were prosecuted with persevering in- 
dustry by the people ; and, at the instigation of the clergy, they 
were punished by the executive, with unrelenting severity. The 
leading cause of the fast which the General Assembly appointed 
in 1649, was the supposed prevalence of witchcraft. Confession 
on the part of the accused was the only attainable evidence of a 
definite kind, and its validity was never questioned by the judges. 
Of proceedings in such cases, several instances are stated in the 
records of the presbytery of Irvine. The only effort made in 
dealing with the accused was to bring them to a fuller acknow- 
ledgement of their guilt. This being done, the day of execution 
was appointed. Of the 22d April 1650, the record of the pres- 
bytery of Irvine bears, that, " the presbyterie, finding that the sin 
of witchcraft was growing daillie, and that in the several paroches 
meikleof the hidden works of darkness was discovered and brought 
to light in the mercie of God, and that severalls were apprehendit 
and in firmance for that sin, did meet occasionallie this day to heir 
and receive the confessions of some, of the said sin of witchcraft, 

place have shown for your humble and godly pastor, which grievances he has these 
several years been labouring under in this place, how little his heart has been encou- 
raged and his hands strengthened in his work. The unkind treatment he has met 
with from some is too well known in this neighbourhood. 1 especially instance 
those base, scurrilous, and caluminatory papers that some in this place dropped agamst 
him. Those papers contained reflections so shameful and unjust that the authors 
durst not avow them. It is probable there were but a few at penning of them, and 
possibly some of those few "may be present ; and I wish there had been as few at pains 
to spread them. But it is not the first time that sinners have been at pams to glory 
in, and spread abroad their own shame : however, it was your minister's good tor- 
tune to be as generally known as the papers were ; so that the memory of them lies 
to day, not as a blot upon him, but upon this place. It was the wish of many at 
this time, who had a regard to their reputation, that more had been done by the ma- 
gistracy of the place, to testify their abhorrence at such a base practice. How was it 
possible to keep the ministers of synod and presbytery, who had occasion to see these 
papers and to hear of them, and the concern the people of Irvine had m their ministers. 
I say was it possible to keep them from these reflections upon it  Oh  but the peo- 
ple of Irvine must be sadly degenerated  Would your forefathers have treated an 
honest minister of the gospel at such a rate I have heard them, here, you will ob- 
serve, I shall not speak of your aspersions publickly, and by some amongst you, up- 
no the ministers of these bounds, &amp;c."— Manuscript sermons in the possession of 
ThomasWhytte, Esq. 134, Princes Street, Edinburgh.

that they might recommend the same to the Lords of Privie 
Counsell for the issuing furth of a commission of assyse to sit up- 
on the said persons, and after hearing, the presbyterie does judge 
the confessions of the persons following, relevant to be recommen- 
dit." Then follow the cases of Margaret Cooper, Janet Robison, 
and Catherine Montgomerie ; all of whom confessed " the renun- 
ciation of their baptism, carnal copulation with the devil, and the 
taking of a new name from him." Other cases of similar import 
might be extracted from the record of the presbytery of Irvine ; 
but we pass on to another source of information, as to the preva- 
lence and treatment of witchcraft in Irvine, about the period un- 
der consideration. This source is found in the Memorials of Mr 
Robert Law, page 219. During February 1682, silver plate was 
stolen from the house of Major- General Montgomerie. A female 
servant was suspected, but while she repelled the suspicion with 
indignation, she proffered her services for the discovery of the 
stolen goods. On a certain day, according to our author, she 
" goes down to a laich cellar, takes the Bible with her, and draws 
a circle about her, and turns a riddle on end twice from north to 
south, or from the right to the left hand, having in her hand nine 
feathers, which she pulled out of the tail of a black cock, and hav- 
ing read the 51st psalm forward, she reads backward chap. 9,.ver. 
19 of the book of Revelation, he appears in a seaman's cloathing 
with a blew cape, and asks what she would; she puts one question 
to him and he answers it, and she casts three feathers at him, 
charging him to his place again, then he disappears at this time." 
Two successive times, there is a similar appearance of the devil, 
who is twice met in a similar manner, when she found herself pre- 
pared to disclose the place where the stolen goods were secreted, 
and in the place mentioned they were accordingly found. For 
this service, the Major-General committed her to prison, where she 
confessed the charge of witchcraft, and told them she had learned 
the art from Doctor Colvin, who used to practise it in Ireland. 

Upon the retirement of Mr Warner in 1 702, Mr William 
M'Knight became minister of Irvine, and remained in this situa- 
tion till 1750, when he died. His successor, Mr Charles Banna- 
tyne, was translated from Kilmorie in Arran, and died soon after 
he laid the foundation of the New Church in 1774. During the 
preceding year a church was formed in Irvine, in connection with 
the Synod of Relief. The first stated pastor of this new church, 
viz. Mr James Jack, was not ordained till 1777. The vacancy 



634 



AYRSHIRE. 



occasioned in the Established Church by the death of Mr Ban- 
natyne was filled up by the appointment of Dr James Richmond, 
who closed his ministry in 1801. During his incumbency, and in 
the year 1782, Mr White, the second minister of the Relief church, 
was ordained to that office, and in 1783 he was deposed for error 
in doctrine and for contumacy, 

His errors were adopted under the influence of a Mrs Buchan. 
It appears from the autograph letters of this woman, and from 
the correspondence of some of her followers which we have seen, 
that, by herself and by them, she was considered as being the spi- 
rit of God dwelling in flesh, — as being, in short, the incarnation of 
the Holy Spirit. From the terms of the libel against Mr White, 
we learn that by him, and as we infer by her, it was held first, 
that sin does not adhere to the believer ; secondly  that Christ tast- 
ed death for all men ; and thirdly, that, whilst the bodies of Saints 
under the New Testament are the temples of the Holy Ghost, 
the Saints under the Old Testament were not favoured with this 
distinction. 

To the honour of the inhabitants generally, and more especially 
of the Relief congregation, her doctrines and pretensions excited 
feelings of abhorrence. Petitions were presented to the Ma- 
gistrates, in which, by Dissenters as well as Churchmen, the ma- 
gistrates were called upon to apprehend her, and proceed against 
her as a blasphemer. They did not do this : but they pro- 
ceeded to dismiss her from Irvine. " To protect the woman 
from insult," as we learn from the Statistical Account, by Dr 
Richmond, " the magistrates accompanied her about a mile 
out of town ; but, notwithstanding all their efl"orts, she was 
grossly insulted by the mob, thrown into ditches, and other- 
wise ill-used by the way. She took up her residence, that 
nio-ht, with some of her followers, in the neighbourhood of Kil- 
maurs ; and, being joined by Mr White and others in the morning, 
the whole company, about forty in number, proceeded on their way 
to Mauchline, and from thence to Cumnock and to Closeburn, m 
Dumfries-shire, singing as they went, and saying that they were go- 
inn- to the New Jerusalem." Mrs Buchan, by one of her adhe- 
rents is stated to be " The very woman prophesied of in the 12th 
Revelations as the great wonder in Heaven." It appears the de- 
lusion was not confined to Irvine, as in one of the letters mention 
is made of the Rev. Francis Kelly at Northampton havmg "con- 
fessed her" Mrs Buchan « in the fullest manner to be of God.

This was done in May 1784; but the woman soon died, and the 
estabhshment being broken up, the imbecile fanatics, who had fol- 
lowed her, returned to their former places of abode. Mr White 
was deposed in 1783, and Mr Peter Robertson was ordained as 
pastor of the Relief church in 1784. During his ministry, the 
building was enlarged ; and Mr Robertson died on the 30th Ja- 
nuary 1819. He was succeeded by Mr Archibald M'Laren, who 
was ordained on the 23d March 1820, and died on Saturday, 11 th 
September 1841. 

Dr James Richmond, author of the former Statistical Account 
of Irvine, died in 1804, and was succeeded by Mr James Hender- 
son, who died in 1820, The present incumbent was admitted to 
his charge on the 22d June of that year. Up to 1785, the sti- 
pend of this parish was seven chalders of victual, chiefly meal, and 
near L. 100 Scots. The augmentation granted at that time was 
L. 400 Scots. The last augmentation was granted on the 19th 
June 1816, and commenced with crop 1816. As then granted, 
the stipend consists of 18 chalders of victual, with L.10 Ster- 
ling for communion elements. Originally, the glebe was about 
one and a-half acres, but subsequently an addition was made to it 
of six and a-half acres. The manse, which is commodious and 
handsome, was built in 1820. 

The Secession congregation in this place was formed in the 
year 1800; and in 1808, they called the Rev. Alexander Camp- 
bell, and he was then ordained among them as their first minister. 
The place where they assembled for public worship at that time 
was found inconvenient, and the building of their present place of 
worship was commenced in 1809, and was opened in January 
1810. It is a neat and commodious chapel, and seated for 800. 

A small place of worship was opened by. the Baptists in the 
year 1803, under the direction of the Rev. George Barclay, their 
first minister. He died in 1838, and was succeeded by his son- 
in-law, the Rev. John Leechman, A.M. Having sold their for- 
mer chapel, Mr Leechman and his friends erected another more 
commodious and more conveniently situated. It is fitted up to 
hold 600 persons.

The population of the parliamentary burgh and parish, as already 
stated, is 8377 ; and for this population, church accommodation is 
provided in the following ratio : Sittings in the Established Church of 
Irvine, 1800 ; in the Secession Church, 800 ; in the Relief Church, 
915; in the Baptist Church, 600; Mr Smith's chapel, 330. In 
addition to this accommodation for one-half of the whole population, 
the community is partly indebted to the liberality of the Church 
Extension Committee in providing additional accommodation in 
the parish church of Fullarton, to the extent of 850. 

Education. — In the Academy which has been already noticed, 
there are three teachers, and accommodation for pupils to the 
amount of 500 ; in the commercial Academy, for 150 ; accommo- 
dation in Mr Smith's school, 150 ; do. in Mr Clark's, 120 ; do, 
in free school, 120; do. in smaller private schools, 100; total, 
1140. Superadded, with the aid of L. 500 from BelPs Fund, ac- 
commodation, in Fullarton school, for 150 ; total, 1290. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — According to a suggestion made 
by Robert Montgomerie, Esq. of Craighouse, banker in Irvine, 
each congregation in Irvine has, for many years, supported its own 
poor, — whilst the poor, not in connection with any congregation, 
are supported from a fund obtained by assessment, and from rents 
of property belonging to the kirk-session, from the fees arising 
from proclamations of marriages, mortcloth dues, and other parish 
funds. Of this fund, one-half is levied from the landward he- 
ritors, and the other half from proprietors and occupants of 
houses in town. Of paupers not connected with any denomi- 
nation of Christians, the average number is about 75 ; and the 
average expenditure for their relief, inclusive of temporary 
and extraordinary cases, is about L. 396 per annum. The dis- 
bursement of this sum is superintended by a committee, com- 
posed of three heritors, the provost, and two magistrates, with the 
clergymen and two elders from each of the Established and Dis- 
senting congregations, — and a committee annually appointed by 
those householders who are assessed. These appoint a sub-com- 
mittee, and an overseer, who is allowed a salary of L.IO per an- 
num. The co-operation of these public bodies is harmonious in 
the highest degree, and in every respect satisfactory to the com- 
munity.

THE REV. WILLIAM RORISON, MINISTER. 



I. ToPOGRAiPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Stair was first erected into a parish in 1 673 for the accommo- 
dation of the noble family of Dalrymple of Stair, whose residence 
was a great distance from Ochiltree, their parish church. With 
a view to this accommodation, that family agreed to pay three 
ch alders of victual, one-half of the stipend then allotted to the 
minister. The other half was to be paid by the parish of Barn- 
well, then suppressed and united to the adjoining parishes of 
Craigie and Tarbolton. On account of some differences between 
the parties concerned in the transaction, and a wrong locality of 
the stipend, the errors of the first erection were rectified by a new 
process in 1709, when several lands were disjoined from, and 
others united to, the parish. 

Extent, c. — This district lies between the rivers Ayr and 
Kill, and is about 6 miles in length by 2 in breadth, though at 
one place it is completely intersected by the parish of Ochiltree. 
It is bounded on the north by Tarbolton ; on the east by Mauch- 
line ; on the south by Ochiltree ; and on the west by Coylton. The 
river Ayr separates it from Tarbolton and Mauchliue, and the Kill 
from Coylton, throughout the greater part of its boundary in that 
direction. The surface partakes of the undulating character of 
the adjoining district, and the soil, that of some small valleys along 
the sides of the rivers excepted, is a stiff clay, with a very reten- 
tive bottom. 

Hydrography — There is only one loch in the parish, and that but 
of small extent. Springs are not numerous, but a sufficient sup- 
ply of water is found generally at no great depth. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The banks of the river Ayr consist, 
nearly throughout their whole extent, of red sandstone. Free- 
stone of a yellowish colour is found near the centre of the parish ; 



638 



AYRSHIRE. 



and about two miles to the westward, on the banks of the Kill, 
there is an extensive quarry of the same description of stone, but 
of a greyish colour ; this is what principally is used for building 
all over the neighbourhood. About two miles up the same river, 
and in immediate connection with the coal-field of Drongan, 
there is a bluish-white freestone, which is fine-grained, and takes 
a beautiful polish. 

In the lands of Dalmore, upon the banks of the river Ayr, is a 
species of whetstone, well known in the country by the name of 
the Water-of-Ayr stone. For several years, both the raising and 
dressing of the stone have been conducted with much greater 
care and neatness than formerly. There are two men almost 
constantly employed ; the one in stripping and polishing, both of 
which operations are performed by machinery, the other in the 
quarry, or in performing whatever else may be necessary. Be- 
sides what is disposed of in the home-market, there is a very con- 
siderable quantity exported. The stone is 40 feet under cover. 
The dip and rise is of an east and west direction. 

About a quarter of a mile above the quarry, there is a trap 
rock which, in the bed of the river, is horizontal, but rises on the 
south side into a considerable eminence. Close to this, up the bed 
of Glenstang burn, occur beds of clay-slate, such as those found 
underlying the stone. These and other indications led to the at- 
tempt, a few years ago, to find it the whetstone in this direction, 
and not without success ; but the quantity discovered was so small, 
and the quality so indifferent, that further search was given up. 
The stone extends up the river so as to be in immediate contact 
with the bed of trap, but is there very coarse. It has not been 
found in this situation, and the remark is to be understood as ap- 
plicable to what lies on the surface. 

Near the stone quarry, is a deposit of black lead, ascertained to 
be of excellent quality, and understood to be of considerable ex- 
tent. The late proprietor, upon proposing to resume workmg it, 
was recommended to pulverize it, as being the most advantageous 
form for the market. He accordingly erected a miln for that pur- 
pose, but did not proceed; for what reason, the writer does not 
recollect. He enlarged and adapted the premises to the carding 
of wool, which he carried on for several years ; which branch, 
however, was given up after his decease, and all the machinery 
disposed of, except what was required for dressing the whetstone.

The strata of copper aud antimony, mentioned in the former 
Account, found on the same property also near to the whetstone, 
have not yet been wrought. 

The writer of the former Account mentions that he thought it 
very probable that limestone would be found in the parish j but 
unfortunately, an object so interesting to the agriculturist has not 
yet been realized. It occurs about two feet in thickness in the 
coal shaft on the estate of Drongan, but lies too deep, and is so 
situated as to be nearly, or rather altogether, unavailable for 
agricultural purposes. 

Coal abounds in the parish. The colliery mentioned in the 
former Account, as having been wrought on the estate of Drongan, 
for above a century, is still in full operation. 

On the lands of Drumdow, about the centre of the parish, there 
is also understood to be a very considerable deposit of coal, which, 
after being wrought for about 15 years, has been discontinued 
within these few months, and it is not yet arranged among the 
parties whether it shall be resumed.

P/anfaiows.— The plantations on the estates of Barskimming 
cover at least 450 acres;— that growing on the banks of the river 
consists chiefly of hard-wood, the remainder of Scotch fir. Larches 
are disposed in belts and clumps. A great proportion of the tim- 
ber, both hard and soft, is of such age and dimensions, as to ad- 
mit of a constant and extensive succession of cutting. 

On the estate of Drongan, there are 150 acres under planta- 
tion. The greater proportion is comparatively young, but very 
thriving, and in a few years will no doubt greatly adorn, as well as 
shelter, a district otherwise a good deal exposed. 

There are 38 acres of wood on the property of Stair. A good 
many clumps, arranged, it is said, after the manner in which the 
British troops were drawn up at the battle of Dettingen, have been

cut down and rooted out lately. A solitary tree, known in the 
neighbourhood as the General, stands on an adjoining eminence. 

Remarkable Trees. — In the lawn at Barskimming, there are a 
great many fine trees, particularly some Scotch firs eighteen in- 
number immediately to the east of the house, all of them remark- 
able for their height and cleanness of stem. The largest is 10 
feet, 8 inches in circumference about a foot from the ground. 
The small holm a little farther up the river in which Burns com- 
posed the poem " Man is made to Mourn," is surrounded with a 
row of beeches, almost all of them of great size and beauty. 

Close by Stair House, is a willow tree which measures 22 feet 
10 inches, about six feet from the ground, but is fast decaying. On 
the same holm is a Lombardy poplar betwixt 80 and 90 feet in 
height. Two beeches forming part of a row growing on the 
banks of the river measure 13 feet to 13 feet six inches respec- 
tively, about two feet above the ground. These, with some others, 
are the remnants of the fine wood which abounded here at a com- 
paratively recent period. 

II. — Civil History. 
Eminent Characters.— The Stair family is so well known to his- 
tory, as to render superfluous here any account of their eminence, 
—civil, military, and literary,— or of the influence almost unpa- 
ralleled in the history of any other family in Scotland, which 
they possessed during a long and most interesting period. 

Another eminent character belonging to the parish was Sir 
Thomas Miller, Baronet, Lord President of the Court of Ses- 
sion. The late Baron Hume, in a memoir read before the Royal 
Society of Edinburgh, states, « that at his death which took place 
at Barskimming in September 1788, after an illness of two days, 
he left no good man his enemy, and that his decease was attend- 
ed with that sincere and extensive regret which only those can 
hope for, who have occupied the like important stations, and ac- 
quitted themselves as well." 

In the general description of Kirkcudbrightshire, as given by 
Chalmers in his Caledonia, it is mentioned that he Sir Thomas 
was the first SherifiF after the suppression of heritable jurisdictions 
and Its erection mto a Stewartry, and that he transmitted to his 
posterity a name of which any family might be proud. 

" To the activity, exertion, and public spirit of the four principal 
heritors," Sir William Miller, Bart, of Barskimming, son and heir

of the above, General, Stuart of Stair, Mungo Smith of Dron- 
gan, and the incumbent, who died in 1804, in his ninety-fifth 
year, and sixty-ninth of his ministry, is chieBy to be ascribed 
■the rapid improvement of agriculture in this place, and the 
great increase of the value of their own estates." Sir William 
has, all along, taken a lively interest in these objects, though he 
has not bestowed that degree of personal superintendence for 
which his father was so remarkable. A very high and just enco- 
mium was passed onhimlately from the Bench, by the Lord Justice- 
Clerk Boyle, upon the occasion of his retiring from office in 
the College of Justice, which he under the title of Lord Glen- 
lee had held for forty-five years, and which encomium was en- 
tered on the journals of the Court. 

Land-owners.— The heritors, according to their valuation, 
are as follows :— Sir William Miller, Bart, of Barskimming ; 
Smith, Esq. of Drongan ; John Hamilton, Esq. ; the Earl of Stair ; 
Messrs Morison of Tribboch Mains, and Meadowbank ; John Ha- 
milton, Esq. of Wright Hill and Drumdow ; Claud Alexander, 
Esq. of Burn and LawhiU ; Mrs Reid of KeyshiU ; James Heron, 

Esq. of Dalmore. 

There is no property in the parish whose annual value does not 

exceed L. 50, • r i  

Parochial Registers.— The earliest parochial register is ot date 
1736 ; the early part not very correctly kept. A register of births 
and marriages has been kept since 1805, and one of deaths since 

Antiquities.- On the property of Tribboch Mains, there are 
the remains of a tower, which was in all probability the resi- 
dence of the proprietor of the adjoining barony of Tribboch, 
lying chiefly in the parish of Ochiltree. The walls are of 
great thickness, and slits are the only openings. On remov- 
ing a cairn which stood on an adjoining knoll, a grave cut out 
of the solid rock was found covered with flag, and contaimng 
blackish dust and some beads. There is a similar structure, but 
of larger dimensions, on the farm of Drongan Mams the wa Is 
of whk:h were till lately almost entire. It was the residence of a 
Lily of the name of Crawfurd, from at least 1404 till 16-23, when 
■ it passed into the hands of the Crawfords of Lochmorns.

sion. The two wings and other considerable additions were built, 
as also decorations and other improvements made in the interior, 
about twenty-five years ago, on a plan furnished by Mr Hamilton 
of Glasgow. In the east wing is the library, containing about 
18,000 volumes; amongst which are the finest editions of the Greek 
and Roman Classics, as also the most valuable works in every de- 
partment of modern literature and science, collected chiefly by 
the present proprietor. The room, upwards of sixty feet in length, 
and of proportionate width, is divided into three compartments; that 
in the centre having a bow window, and its ceiling beautifully deco- 
rated. The general effect is highly imposing, and it is universally 
considered as doing great credit to the taste and skill of the distin- 
guished architect. The house stands close on the banks of the 
river Ayr, and the lawn is of very considerable extent, forming, as 
the writer of the former Account of the parish justly remarks, a 
landscape such as is rarely to be met with in an inland situa- 
tion. 

In a holm, about three miles down the river, stands Stair House. 
The original portion is very much decayed, but the comparative- 
ly modern part is in rather better order, and inhabited by the ten- 
ant who farms the property. The property contains 168 acres. 
It is well known that Field- Marshal Stair had the misfortune, 
when a boy, to kill his elder brother, by the accidental discharge 
of a pistol ; and that his parents found it necessary, for their 
own comfort, to banish him from their sight, as his presence awak- 
ened the most painful associations. The tradition in the neigh- 
bourhood is, that this melancholy event took place in a room 
on the ground-floor, which, it is said, was, long after, kept 
locked by the succeeding proprietors, and was the reason for the 
property being disposed of. After passing through many hands, it 
was repurchased by the present Earl, about fifteen years ago, and 
is understood to be now entailed. 

Drongan House is, at present, in a very dilapidated state. It is 
known that the late proprietor contemplated either the rebuilding or 
making great repairs and additions— all of which, as well as many 
other designs for the improvement of his estate generally, were frus- 
trated by his much lamented death, which took place some years 
ago at Calcutta, where he had for many years resided as a mer- 
chant and banker, and when he was on the eve of returning home. 

On four of the smaller properties, there are commodious dwel- 
ling-houses, with suitable offices.

We have two grain mills, the one in the eastern, the other in 
the western division of the parish, each of which has a saw-mill 
attached ; another saw-mill has been erected lately on the lands of 
Dalmore, about the centre of the parish. One of the grain mills 
has also a thrashing-mill attached to it and driven by water-power. 
There are twelve other machines of the same "kind, belonging to a 
like number of farms, but driven by horse power. 

Manufactures. — At Coalha', on the estate of Drongan, there 
has been, for a long period,'a pottery of earthenware, black and 
brown, adapted to domestic and dairy purposes, flower-pots, chim- 
ney-cans. The ware, besides being used all over this county, is 
in great demand throughout Dumfries-shire, and the two counties 
of Galloway, though coming into competition in that quarter with 
English manufacture, and under the disadvantage of a much more 
expensive carriage. Very considerable quantities are sent to Ame- 
rica, the Highlands, and even to Glasgow. Mr Boyle, the tacks- 
man, is also an extensive tile-burner — has been the successful com- 
petitor in this quarter, and gained the first prize at the last 
Highland Society meeting at Perth. He does not carry on this 
branch here, but has a work in the neighbouring parish of Coylton, 
very conveniently situated for the western and middle quarter of 
the parish.

What the writer of the former Account says of the inhabitants 
of that period, is applicable to far the greater proportion of the 
present population, — that they are in their morals sober, honest, 
and industrious, and strongly attached to the Established, Church. 

There have been five illegitimate births within the last three 
years. 

IV. — Industry. 

The parish is wholly agricultural, and is divided into 36 farms, 
two of which are under the management of their proprietors. The 
others are possessed by 29 tenants ; there are 8 small holdings. 

There are 41 male farm-servants; 15 labourers; 2 master 
carpenters, and 2 others engaged in jobs ; 2 mill-wrights, one of 
them usually employing from 2 to 3 hands, the other occasionally 
working as carpenter; 2 master blacksmiths, and another en- 
gaged by the tacksmen of Drongan colliery for purposes about the 
works ; 4 master shoemakers, three of whom constantly employ 
several hands ; 3 tailors ; 2 gardeners ; 1 nurseryman ; 1 gar- 
den and orchard ; about 32 colliers ; 2 masons ; 1 customer 
weaver, who usually employs a journeyman ; 1 stocking-framer ; 
4 persons who sell groceries; number of servants, 89; males un- 
der 20 years of age, 16 ; above do. 25; females, 48. 

The arable land amounts to about 3400 acres, and there are 
at least 640 acres covered with wood. By far the greater propor- 
tion is planted. Scotch fir and larch constitute by much the largest 
proportion, and seem well adapted to the soil. 

The writer has not the means of ascertaining the average rent 
of arable land per acre ; but considers himself warranted in stating 
that L. 1 is very nearly the rate actually paid in most years, 
though a considerably higher sum probably stands in many in- 
stances on the rent-roll. The grazing of a cow or ox is about 
L.3. 

Live-Stock. — There are 96 work-horses ; 481 milk cows, all of 
the Ayrshire breed ; 222 young cattle ; and a few score of mountain 
sheep are fed on the lawn at Barskimming. Most of the farmers 
keep a few pets, chiefly for the sake of the wool for domestic 
purposes. 

AgricuUure.~The grain raised in the parish is oats, peas, and 
barley. Some years ago, wheat formed a regular part of the ro- 
tation on the estate of Barskimming, but, having been found to 



643 



AYRSHIRE. 



be prejudicial to the pasture, was given up. A few farms, or ra- 
ther portions of a few farms, produce potatoes and turnips in suffi- 
cient quantity to afford a fair remuneration ; but, in general, the 
case is otherwise, and most of our farmers accordingly content 
themselves with raising no more potatoes than what will serve 
their families. The remainder of the dung is often spread on lea, 
and seldom or never fails to raise an excellent crop of beans. The 
following crop of oats is, in many cases, nearly double of what it 
would else have probably been, and thus, as has been remarked, 
they have the bean crop to the bargain. Comparatively little has 
yet been done in the way of draining, but, as it is known that 
both landlords and tenants are fast becoming convinced of the 
utility of the practice, there can be little doubt of its soon be- 
coming general, and of green cropping being carried to a fargreater 
extent than hitherto. 

Nineteen years is the general duration of leases. 
The state of farm-buildings is, with few exceptions, good. The 
enclosures, consisting almost entirely of thorn hedges, are gene- 
rally kept with considerable care. 

Not many years ago there were three quarries of freestone in 
the parish, but the working of one of them, though a valuable 
stone for several purposes, and in great abundance, has been given 
up, chiefly on account of the greatness of the dip and consequent 
expense of raising it. The other two are in full operation ; that 
on the lands of Drumdow supplies the greater proportion of the 
building material required in the neighbourhood ; that on Gar- 
rochburn fine white freestone is 14 feet in depth, very hard, 
and fit for every kind of mason-work, takes a fine polish, makes 
excellent pavement, and is well adapted for making grinding- 
stones for any kind of edge tools ; the beds run from 27 to 8 
inches in thickness. There is about 6 feet of fine white clay on 
the top of the bed, and about 13 feet of the same beneath it. 
About 40 tons of the stone are raised annually, and about 17 tons 
is the average amount sold. 

Produce.— The writer is unable to state with any thing like 
accuracy the average gross amount of raw produce raised in the 
parish ; but believes it to be nearly as follows :— 

4500 bolls of white corn, beans, and pease. 
1400 bolls of potatoes and liirnips. 
6000 stones of cheese. 

The 222 young cattle reared in the parish may be fairly esti- 



STAIR.

mated at L. 1 per head. There are very few young horses bred 
in the parish, probably not more than ten annually ; 5 acres of 
orchard at L. 9 per acre. Hay cultivated may yield about L. 1000. 

There are about 20 meri employed at the coal works of Dron- 
gan, but they have not constant work throughout the year. The 
output of coal is not allowed to exceed 20 creels which is some 
thing short of three tons per day. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Market-Toion. — Ayr is the nearest market-town, and is about 
eight miles from the centre of the parish. The post-office at Tarbol- 
tonis the nearest; but, upon the whole, the eastern and western quar- 
ters have readiest communication with Mauchline and Ayr. At the 
coal- works of Drongan, there is a collection of houses, affording ac- 
commodation for fifteen or sixteen families, and another in the mid- 
quarter inhabited by six or seven families; but no village, properly so 
called. The parish is intersected by two turnpike roads, which are 
about six miles in extent. On that leading from Cumnock to Ayr, a 
coach travels on Tuesdays and Fridays, the market days in Ayr. 
There are three bridges over the Water of Ayr. The upper one is 
very ancient, but in a complete state of repair; thelower, consisting 
of two arches, was builtin 1745 at a very considerable expense ; that 
in the middle was erected at the private cost of the late Sir Thomas 
Miller, near his house of Barskimming. It consists of one arch, 
which is more than 70 feet in the span, and about the same in 
height above the medium depth of the river, and has often 
tempted both the professional and amateur artist to exercise the 
pencil. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The form of the parish is somewhat tri- 
angular. The church stands in the north corner near to Stair 
House, and is about three miles and a-half from the one extremity of 
the parish, and nearly five from the other. A site more convenient, 
upon the whole, for the population could hardly have been chosen. 
The church was roofed over many years ago, and re-seated. Still 
it is too small. It is known, however, that the heritors are con- 
vinced of the propriety of builing a new one ere long. The 
manse was built in 1807, and is in good repair. The glebe ex- 
tends to about 30 acres, and would let perhaps for a little more 
than L. 30. The stipend, by decreet of the Court of Teinds in 
1816, amounts to I4chalders, half meal, half barley, together with 
an allowance of L. 8, 6s. 8d. Sterling, for communion elements. 

The number of families in the parish is 1 44, ten of which belong

to the Associate Synod, two are Roman Catliolics, tlic rest belong to 
the Establislied Church. The Dissenters Presbyterians attend 
pubUc worship in the chapel at Tarbolton and Mauchline, the 
Roman Catholics at Ayr. The average number of communicants 
at the Established Church is about 300. An Association for re- 
ligious and educational purposes was formed about a year ago. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, the parochial, 
and one unendowed ; the teacher has a school-house and dwelling- 
house, both provided at the private expense of Lord Glenlee, and 
he is entirely dependent on the fees, which are necessarily small. 
The salary of the parochial teacher is L. 30, and the fees may 
amount to between L. 20 and L. 80. 

The people are very much alive to the benefits ofeducation, and 
there are few, if any, who are not ready to make great sacrifices in 
order tohave their children instructed in whatever branches are 
desirable in their station, and suited to their prospects in life. 

P/or and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid is about seven ; and average allowance to 
each per week is Is. The annual collections at the church door 
amount to abouL. 20 ; about L. 40 more is required for the relief 
of the poor, and is raised by assessment of the heritors according 
to their respective valuations. The reluctance to apply for paro- 
chial aid is certainly not so great as it was at no distant period. 

Ale-houses. — There are two houses in which ale and spirituous 
liquors are sold. 

Coal is the fuel in universal use ; and any cottager in the pa- 
rish may have a cartful laid down at his door for 5s. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
This district has not lagged behind in the march of improve- 
ment. Since the date of the last Account, almost every farm stead- 
ing has been rebuilt and roofed with slate. The roads have been 
almost entirely relaid according to the modern principles of the 
art,— though there is still room for improvement in the means of 
communication. It is most gratifying to add, that the labour- 
ing classes have largely participated in the benefits resulting from 
the improvements in agriculture, and the arts generally.

PRESBYTERY OF AYR, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ALEXANDER DUNCAN, MINISTER. 

1. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — In some old records, the name of this parish is written 
Quiltoun and Cuiltoun, and more recently we find it Coiltoune 
and Coyltoune. Some, on the authority of an old tradition, ima- 
gine it took its name from Coilus, a king of the ancient Britons, 
said to have been killed in a battle fought in the vicinity, and in-' 
terred near the ruins of the old church in the present burying 
ground. Little trust can be put in this account. It is more 
likely the parish received its appellation from some feature 
characteristic of the district : or, from the river Coyl, which ris- 
es in its upper extremity, and forms the boundary of the origi- 
nal parish in nearly all its extent. And Coyl may be of Celtic 
derivation," — Coill in Gaelic signifying wood, the plural of which 
is Coiltean ; or, it may be as Chalmers conjectures, from the 
British Coll or Kell, a Grove ; or the British Coll, the plural 
Cyll or Kyll, signifying hazelwood, and the Saxon termination 
ton. If, as is supposed, the district of Kyle was at one period a 
forest, and we may conjecture that the hazel abounded on the 
banks of this river, and its contiguous dells and ridges, both stream 
and parish may have had their designation from this circumstance ; 
— and the name would then signify the stream of the hazehcood 
grove, the place of hazelwoods. 

Boundaries, Extent, 6c. — The adjacent parishes are Dalmelling- 
ton and Dalrymple on the south : Tarbolton and St Quivox on 
the north ; Ochiltree and Stair on the east ; and Dalrymple and 
Ayr on the west. 

Coylton is about twelve miles in extreme length ; nearly two at 
an average in breadth ; and contains about eighteen square miles," 
and 11,515 imperial, or 9160 Scotch acres. 

Topographical Appearances. — From the river Ayr, which flows 
nearly four miles along its north-west side, separating it from Tar- 
bolton and St Quivox, it ascends in a south-eastern direction, with 



650 



AYRSHIRE. 



an irregular undulating surface, till it reaches and forms the hei'hts 
termed the Craigs of Coyl, the elevation of which above the sea 
is about 750 feet. From thence, it stretches farther in the 
same line, and terminates in a loftier ridge, which bounds it and 
Dalmellington, and forms part of the uplands of the valley that is 
watered by the river Doon. 

The summit of this ridge is upwards of 1100 feet above the 
sea-level, and commands, almost on all sides, most extensive, va- 
ried, and in some aspects very magnificent views. • 

Climate. — The climate is mild, but for a considerable part of 
the year more humid than on the east side of the island. The 
atmosphere of the greater part of the parish is perhaps more moist 
than in some other districts of Ayrshire. The nature of the 
soil, a retentive'clay, and the extent of undrained land in the pa- 
rish, the small lochs in the bounds, and the number of marshes or 
bogs kept for raising meadow hay, must tend to produce this ef- 
fect, — in addition to the more general circumstance, that a great- 
er quantity of rain falls on the west than on the opposite coast. 

It does not appear that this degree of atmospheric humidity has 
any effect on the state of health and disease. The abundance of 
fuel in the district, the extent to which woollen is used instead of 
linen, the habits of cleanliness for which the inhabitants are remark- 
able, the degree in which the necessaries, and even comforts, of 
life are obtained, and the nature of the occupations chiefly agri- 
cultural, must greatly counteract any evil that might arise from 
moistness of climate. And to these causes it must in part be as- 
cribed, that the inhabitants in general, especially the female part, 
are a tine-looking, stout, and active race. 

Hydrography. — The parish, in many parts, is well supplied with 
springs of good water. There are exceptions, however. In some 
places, especially about the middle and lower division, it cannot 
be obtained. In others, it is difficult to reach, and when found, 
of inferior quality. 

There are three lakes, Martnaham, Fergus, and Snipe, partly 
in this parish. Loch Fergus is a beautiful sheet of water, covering 
about twenty Scotch acres, and has a wooded island in the middle of 
it, nearly an acre in extent. Loch Snipe spreads over about five acres; 
and Martnaham, half of which is in Dalrymple, is about a mile 
and a-half long, and at an average a furlong broad. Its greatest 
width is 2 furlongs, and it is 26 feet deep at the deepest jart. In 
the centre of the parish, on the estate of Sundrum, there is a 



COYLTON. 



651 



little lake called Lochend, which covers from two to three acres, 
and is about 14 feet at its greatest depth. Loch Martnaham 
is the haunt of wild-duck, geese, widgeon, teal, and other water- 
fowl, and abounds in pike, perch, and eel. These are likewise 
found in some of the other lochs mentioned. 

Mivers. — The rivers are the Coyl or Kill, as it is usually called, 
and the Ayr. The former rises in the upper end of the parish, 
and after a winding course of nearly ten miles, empties itself into 
the Ayr. The Ayr bounds Coylton for nearly four miles on the 
north. The banks and holms of these rivers possess great natural 
beauty, which, in most parts, especially on the Sundrum, Gad- 
girth, and Auchencruive estates, is rendered enchanting by the 
richness of the wooding. There is a cascade on the Kill, imme- 
diately under the beautiful ridge on which Sundrum Castle stands. 
The fall is about 15 feet, and the breadth of the river at the place 
from 25 to 30 feet. When the stream is swollen by the floods, 
the roar of this little cataract adds much to the charm of its syl- 
van banks. 

The Ayr and Coyl are the habitats of a yellow trout. At a 
former period, pike are said to have frequented the Ayr, but must 
have long since deserted it. Salmon at one time were caught in 
abundance. But since the erection of a mill-dam near the town of 
Ayr, and from other causes, few are now taken. The complaint 
often expressed by anglers of other streams, once noted for the 
excellence of the sport they afforded, has of late years been 
made of both these rivers. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — In some useful minerals, Coylton 
may be said to be rich. It contains coal, limestone, plumbago, 
ironstone, clay-slate, basalt, various kinds and colours of free- 
stone, fire-clay, marl, &amp;c. 

The geological character of the stratifications is of that order 
which marks the coal formation. The coal strata are of consi- 
derable extent, and are, or have been, wrought on the Sundrum, 
Gadgirth, Knockshoggle, Craighall, Duchray, and Crossbill 
estates. The chief coal-field, so far as yet explored, consists of 
three strata. The first a layer 3 feet thick ; about 1 5 fathoms below 
this, a stratum 1 1 feet in depth ; and about 6 fathoms farther down, 
a 5 feet coal. The dip is to the north-east. The incumbent

at Millmannoch. And the Craigs of Kyle" is the scene of a similar production,

minerals vary in different parts, although there are some of the 
same nature uniformly found throughout this coal-field. 

Strata of ironstone, from 4 to 6 inches thick, are seen at dif- 
ferent parts in the bed of the Coyl. There is a layer of about -4 
inches between the 3 and 1 1 feet coal. And in different parts of 
the same region, small beds or « doggers" are met with. The 
quality is not the best. In the year 1800, a plumbago mine was 
discovered on the farm of I.aigh Dalmore, on the banks of the 
Ayr. It was opened and wrought for sale in 1808, and sold in 
the London and' Bristol markets at L. 10 per ton. The work 
continued till the close of the war, in 1815, when the importation of 
black-lead of superior quality from foreign countries, and also that 
discovered in the Borrowdale mountains in Cumberland, drove it 
from the market. An attempt was made in 1835 to renew the 
work, and from two to three tons put out; but this not finding 
sale, operations were abandoned. Limestone was discovered, about 
fifty years ago, at the east end of the Craigs of Coyl, on the pro- 
perty, now of Lord Dudley Coutts Stewart. The stratum is from 
six to seven feet in thickness. It varies in quality. Traces of 
shells are distinctly seen in it. Close by this mine, there is 
coal wrought ; but, being of an inferior kind, it is only used for 
burning the limestone. Fire-clay is also found in the neighbour- 
hood of.the limestone quarry, in great abundance. Clay-slate, or 
the famed Water-of-Ayr stone, used for hones, was raised for 
some years on Knocksboggle farm ; but, being found in greater 
quantity, easier wrought, and of better quality, in the adjoining 
parish of Stair, the Coylton stone has been deserted. Moss and 
peat are met with in different parts. 

Mr Burnett of Gadgirth, in searching for tile-clay, a year or 
two back, discovered a bed of marl from four to six feet thick, 
under a layer of clay from two to three feet, and a stratum of moss 
from three to five feet in depth. The marl is supposed to extend 
through two or three acres. It contains 40 per cent, of carbonate 
of lime, 10 parts of animal and vegetable substances, and 50 of 
earthy and other particles, such as clay, sand, water, &amp;c. It has 
not yet undergone the test of experiment as a manure, although 
some has already been bought for this purpose. Marl was found, 
many years ago, on the estate of the Marquis of Ailsa, but it 
was not found suitable to agricultural purposes. 

Soil. The soil varies, but its general character is that of an 

G 



COYLTON. 



653 



adhesive ungenerous clay, on a substratum of a like stiff cold re- 
tentive mould. Till the introduction of recent improvements, it 
did not yield very abundant crops. But when properly drained 
and cultivated, it loses its tenacity, becomes loose and friable ; in 
most cases, increases 30 per cent, in value ; and, by its excellent 
crops, amply repays the toil and outlay of landlord and tenant. 
The holms or flat grounds on the banks of the rivers are of a light 
loamy nature, on a sandy or gravelly bottom. There are inland 
fields, and parts of farms of a similar nature. These are very fer- 
tile, and well adapted to all kinds of green crop. 

Zoology. — Besides the fur and feathered tribes common in other 
parts of the county, such as partridge, hare, &amp;c. there are rabbits, 
snipe, wild-duck, pheasants, moorfowl, and black-oock. The 
blackbird, thrush, woodlark, bullfinch, goldfinch, and siskin, 
birds noted for their song, frequent and breed in the woods and 
policies on the Ayr and Coyl. Some time ago, there was shot on 
the estate of Drumsuy a hoopoe, the Upupa epops of Linnaeus. 
This bird is an inhabitant of the south of Europe and opposite 
shores of Africa; it is met with in Asia, and abounds in the de- 
serts of Russia and Tartary. It seldom breeds in this country. 
Solitary individuals are found to migrate from their usual haunts, 
but few, I believe, have been seen so far north in Britain as the 
above. 

Botany. — The following is a list by an eminent botanist, of 
some of the rarest plants in Coylton : 

Aira canescens Sambucus ebulus Lysimachia vulgaris 

Arundo phragmites Sparganium simplex Lobelia Dortmanna 

Alisma simplex Hypericum elodes Pilularia globulifera 

Botrychium lunaria Littorella lacustris lluscus acculeatus 

Fumaria claviculata Listera ovata Scirpus lacustris. 

Primula veris 

Plantations. — The lower part of the parish is well wooded. Th 
plantations are chiefly of larch and Scotch fir. But oak, beech 
ash, elm, sycamore, horse chestnut, lime, silver and spruce fir, o.sier 
birch, &amp;c. likewise abound. The soil on the banks of the rivers is 
friendly to all kinds of hard-wood ; and there are some trees, es- 
pecially silver and spruce fir, ash, elm, osier, beech, sycamore, 
and horse-chestnut, of great size and beauty. 

11. — Civil History. 

Coylton was formerly of smaller dimensions than at present. 
The original parish lies along the south banks of the Coyl. 
About the end of the seventeenth or beginning of the eight-

eenth century, that portion of it lying on the north and cast 
side of this stream was taken from Ochiltree, and annexed 
quoad sacra to Coylton. The district annexed was part of the 
estate of Gadgirth, now in possession of three proprietors. The 
value of the part transferred in the old valuation is L.360, that 
of the original parish, L.2930, 16s. 2d. Scotch" money. 

Eminent Men, Sfc.—A branch of the family of the Crawfords 
of Camlarg and Drongan was the founder of an old family, 
—the Crawfords of Drumsuy in Coylton. William, the first 
of this name, is designed in a writ under the Great Seal in 
1567, " W. Crawford of Drumsoy." David Crawford, the eighth 
in descent, was, we learn, a man of distinguished literary acquire- 
ments. Among other productions, he wrote a historical defence 
of Queen Mary of Scotland ; a work said to have been highly es- 
teemed in his day by those who espoused the cause of this un- 
happy lady. This Crawford was also historiographer for Scotland 
to Queen Anne. He died in 1710, and about twenty years after- 
wards, the barony of Drumsuy was sold, and has since passed 
through different hands. It is now possessed by Lord Dudley 
Coutts Stewart. 

John Black, LL. D., the learned author of the life of Tasso, 
was minister of Coylton for fifteen years. - He was a native of 
Douglas in Lanarkshire, and received the elements of his educa- 
tion in its parish-school. He was ordained in 1810, and died in 
1825. 

The name of John Hamilton, Esq. of Sundrum, grandfather of 
the present proprietor, still lives in this parish and county. He 
possessed eminent talents, and was admired both as a public and 
private character. He was for many years convener of Ayrshire, 
and in this capacity so gained the respect of all ranks, that the 
noblemen and gentlemen of the county ordered a portrait of him 
to be suspended in the hall, where they met to transact business. 

Landed Propi'ietors. — There are nine landed proprietors: The 
Most Noble the Marquis of Ailsa; Lord Dudley Coutts Stewart of 
Drumsuy; John Hamilton, Esq. of Sundrum; James Oswald, 
Esq. of Auchencruive ; John Joseph Burnett, Esq. of Gadgirth ; 
Taylor Cathcart, Esq. of Pitcairley ; John Bell, Esq. of Enter- 
kine ; John Smith, Esq. of Drongan ; Andrew Campbell, Esq. of 
Rankinston. 

The resident heritors are, John Hamilton, Esq. ; John Joseph 
Burnett, Esq. ; and Andrew Campbell, Esq.

Parochial Registers. — The session records extant commenced on 
6th February 1723. Baptisms and marriages have been registered 
for upwards of a century. The earliest registration of births is 
dated 15th February 1725; and of marriages, 29th May 1725. 
Since that time, these registers have, with few exceptions, been re- 
gularly kept. The present session-clerk has kept, with great ac- 
curacy, a register of the deaths for the last fourteen years. 

Antiquities. — The parish can boast of few reliques of antiquity. 
Some fragments of the Old Church may perhaps be noticed un- 
der this head. The building was taken down, ten or eleven years 
ago. The date of its erection is not known. It was built prior to 
the Reformation, but exhibited nothing of that fine architecture 
which distinguished many of the religious fabricks -of the Roman 
Catholic Church. On Cloquhernan, Drumsuy estate, there is a 
well called the chapel, or Carnell well, near to which, it is said, a 
church or chapel stood, which existed at the time of the Reforma- 
tion. This is supposed by some to have been the place in which 
John Knox officiated, to which reference is made by Dr M'Crie in 
his Life of the Reformer, where he says, that " Knox preached in 
the houses of Bar, Kincancleuch, Carnell, Ochiltree, Gadgirth, 
and in the town of Ayr." There is also a well on the farm of Raith- 
hill, the property of the Marquis of Ailsa, called the Chapel- well, 
beside which appear the foundations of a building, which is said to 
have been a chapel, from which the spring had its name. 

If uncertain authority is to be followed, this district seems to 
have had great attractions for the Church. We have seen a state- 
ment from an old writing, which bears that the island in Lochfergus 
was the seat of a monastery. There are certainly stones and 
other appearances in the place, from which imagination might 
easily conclude that, at some distant time, there was such a build- 
ing on this interesting spot. Till lately, this islet, now cover- 
ed with alder bushes, young larch, Scotch fir, &amp;c. was the site 
of some fine old trees, and the resort of herons. But these 
successors of the monks have long since deserted their haunt, and 
their memory, like that of their predecessors, has almost passed 
into oblivion. Tradition says that this lake derived its name from 
Fergus, one of the Scottish kings, who defeated Coilus, king of 

• In a small work entitled " A Summary of theChronicles of Scotland," publish- 
ed in 1624, there is a brief description of Ayrshire. Among many other places of 
importance enumerated, mention is made of " the loch of Martnam with a strons 
Tower," and of" Loch Fergus, with an isle with many growing trees, where great 
plenty of herons resort with the loch-seal. There is a decayed monastery in it."

the Britons, in the adjoining fields. The latter, flying to the east- 
ward, is said to have crossed the Coy, at a ford at the farm of 
Knockmurran, where he was saved from a watery grave, by getting 
on a large stone in the midst of the stream, then swollen by a flood ; 
and from this circumstance, the place was called " the King's 
steps," — a name it has retained till this day. There may be other 
versions of this story, I have no doubt ; but it is of no use to de- 
tail histories, of which there is no authentic written memorial. 

The castle, or old part of the house of Sundrum, the seat of John 
Hamilton, Esq. is the most ancient building in the parish. It is 
not known when it was erected ; but its position and structure 
bear ample proof that this must have been at a very early period, 
when the constant feuds of rival chiefs, and the petty wars, which, 
on the slightest causes, embroiled the country, taught the ba- 
rons of these days the necessity of constructing their mansions, 
so as to afford them security in times of peace, and defence in war. 
In some parts, the walls are about twelve feet in thickness, and 
the window recesses so deep, that they might almost be converted 
into closets or sleeping-apartments. 

Gadgirth Castle, which is now supplanted by a house built in 
modern fashion, was a place of great note and antiquity. It was 
the seat of the family of Chalmers, a gentleman who took an ac- 
tive part in promoting the Reformation. Knox, when in the west, 
preached in this castle, and found, as did all the Reforming mi- 
nisters, a warm friend, and fearless defender in the laird of Gad- 
girth. Mr Burnett succeeded to this property, through his mater- 
nal grandfather. 

Several years ago, a number of silver coins of the reigns of Eli- 
zabeth, James VI. and Charles I. were dug up on the farm of Bar- 
gannoch ; and more recently, four stone coffins were found in a 
field on Barcleuch, near the banks of the Ayr.

The average number of births for the last seven years, 42 
deaths, . . 22

The increase of population since the earliest account has been 
owing in part to the subdivision of large farms, but principally to 



COYLTON. 



657 



the erection of houses on building leases, and of cottages by pro- 
prietors, and to the much greater extent to which the coal mines 
have been wrought, which has caused an influx of a migrating 
population. 

There are no proprietors, the value of whose estates in the 
parish is under L. 50. All are far above this amount. 

IV. — Injdustry. 
Coylton, with the exception of the coal trade, is almost entirely 
an agricultural parish. Of the. 11,515 imperial, or 9160 Scotch 
acres it contains, the number of Scotch acres cultivated or occa- 
sionally in tillage, is 6404; the number never cultivated and con- 
stantly in pasture, about 2120; the number in wood, chiefly forest 
trees, 636. Part of those which have never been cultivated might 
be greatly improved for sheep or cattle pastures, but few or none 
could with profit be added to the arable lands. 

The old valued rent of the parish is L. 3290, 16s. 2d. Scotch. 
The present real land rental is L. 7734 Sterling. The average - 
rent of land per acre over the whole parish is 18s. But, as the 
hill affects so much the average of the low and arable ground, it 
will give a more satisfactory view of the value of land, and state 
of rents, to mention, that the average rent per acre of the land 
lying between the Ayr, and a line stretching from the east end of 
Loch Martnaham to the Coyl, above Coylton village, and com- 
prising about 3342 acres, is L. 1, 9s. 6.id. For the arable land 
in the district immediately above this, amounting to nearly 3000 
acres, the rent is 14s. 6d, per acre ; and for the hill and moor 
land, being upwards of 2000 acres, 3s. 6d. per acre. 

The price of grazing varies according to the pasture. In the 
highest part of the parish, the grazing of a full-grown ox or cow 
is L. 2, 15s. Towards the middle district, L. 3 ; and in the 
best pastures in the lowest division, L. 3, lOs. or L. 4. The 
summer's grass of a year-old differs in a similar ratio, being L. 1, 
and L. 1, 5s.; and of a two-years'-old, L. 1, 10s. and L. 1, 15s. 
or L.2. 

The breed of cattle almost universally kept is the pure Ayr- 
shire. In the high grounds, a few of the West Highland or Gal- 
loway kind are pastured ; these being better adapted to the natural 
grasses and keener climate. Till very lately, the sheep-stocks 
reared were the black-faced, from the North Highlands or Gal- 
loway. But, for some years, a cross between the black-faced and 

Cheviot has been introduced. It was imagined that the Cheviot 
AYR. „, . 



658 



AYRSHIRE. 



would not thrive in the cold wet climate and pastures of the west. 
But since the system of open-draining moor lands has been prac- 
tised, this evil has in part been remedied, and the great superiority 
of the wool of this cross breed has more than compensated any 
loss from rearing the more tender stock. The loss, indeed, from 
severe and wet seasons, and the deterioration of the animal, has 
been so little, that it is contemplated, as the sheep-walks are im- 
proved, to approach still nearer to the pure Cheviot. 

Husbandry. — The parish in many parts has, of late years, made 
great progress in agriculture. Wherever furrow draining with tiles 
or stones has been adopted, and it is rapidly extending, the im- 
provement is visible. There are great faciUties for perfecting 
this system in the tile-works and stone quarries in the parish. 
The chief obstacles are the want of capital, the state of rents and 
markets, and the general duration of the leases. The last might 
perhaps be obviated, were some such principle followed as that of 
lengthening the lease, in proportion to the number of acres which 
a tenant drains and improves at his own cost. But indeed, the 
causes noticed are in the way of being in a great measure remov- 
ed, by the enlightened liberality of some proprietors, of whom 1 
might mention, Mr Hamilton of Sundrum, Mr Oswald of Auch- 
encruive, and Mr Burnett of Gadgirth, who either execute the 
drains at their own expense, and receive an interest of four or five 
per cent, on the outlay ; or supply the tiles at a reduced price ; or 
afford other encouragements to the tenants. The nature of the 
greater part of the subsoil in the parish being cold tenacious clay, 
subsoil ploughing must be of the greatest benefit. This has been 
practised to a very limited extent. But as few tenants possess the 
requisite force, and the expense considerable, it is feared this 
great improvement will not soon become so universal as could be 
wished. 

The dairy is an object of chief attention, and is managed with 
great skill on many farms. Cheese, usually known by the name 
Dunlop, is made in great quantities, and sometimes of supe- 
rior quality. It may give an idea of the amount of dairy produce 
sold yearly, to state that in most farms about one-half, in some 
nearly two-thirds, of the rents are paid by it. 

The grain chiefly raised is oats. Wheat in small proportion ; 
soil and climate in most parts being hitherto unpropitious. The 
turnip husbandry, till of late, was not much attended to. It is 
now getting into greater favour both with soil and tenant, and

the benefits of it are yearly inducing the farmer to extend its cul- 
tivation. The rotation of cropping, for a long time in general 
practice, was two white crops, a green crop, succeeded by another 
white crop with grass seeds, and afterwards three or four years 
in pasture. But the system which experience has shown to be 
best adapted to the clay lands in the parish, and which, at least ex- 
pense, yields the best return, and keeps the land in best condition, 
is that of two white crops, and sowing grass seeds with the second 
crop, afterwards to lie four or five years in pasture. And the rota- 
tion best adapted for the light land is, one white crop, a green 
crop, a white crop again, with grass seeds, and pasture four or 
five years, as may be. 

The general duration of leases is eighteen or nineteen years. 
The fences chiefly used are thorn hedges. In most parts, when 
properly kept, they thrive well. In the farm-steads, there has 
been great improvement within the last twenty years ; the old 
and insufficient erections giving place to buildings more commo- 
dious and substantial, and more agreeable to modern taste. 

Tile- Works. — There are two tile-works in the parish. One 
on the estate of Gadgirth, the property of Mr Burnett, who 
is a most spirited and successful improver. In the course of a 
year, when the demand was brisk, about 400,000 tiles were ma- 
nufactured at this work. The other is on Mr Oswald's property, 
and was erected in 1833 by Mr Robert Boyle, at his own cost, on 
a lease of fifteen years at a fixed rental. Both bricks and tiles are 
made at this work. The number of draining tiles and soles made 
yearly before the sale was affected by the erection of similar 
works in the neighbourhood, was about 575,000 ; and of bricks, 
about 150,000. The demand for bricks, it is expected, will soon 
greatly increase. Mr Boyle uses the Marquis of Tweeddale's 
patent tile machine, the only one at present in operation in 
Ayrshire. 

Qiiarries. — There are several quarries of excellent stone, and 
more might be opened, if necessary. At present, there are three 
wrought on th.e estate of Mr Hamilton of Sundrum, They are 
all of freestone, though of different kinds ; a red, a white, and a 
gray blue stone. The two first are highly approved for build- 
ing; the last mentioned equally so for pavement, &amp;c. 

There is a blue whinstone quarry on the Drumsuy property, 
from which great quantities of road-metal are yearly taken. Tlie 
whole Craigs of Coyl are of this pure material.

AYRSHIRE. 



The number of coal mines is three. One on Sundrum ; an- 
other on Gadgirth ; and the third on Craighall or Auchencruive 
estates. The yearly output from the whole is at the rate of 8333 
tons. The coal varies in quality and price. Some sells at 10s., 
others at 9s. per ton, export prices. A ton consists of about 12 
creels, or two single cart loads. 

The lime quarry on Drumsuy estate has produced for the last 
few years, at the rate of 12,000 bolls, or 1090 tons annually. The 
lime sells at 8d. per boll, or 7s. 4d. per ton. 

The expense of furrow-draining varies according to the dis- 
tance to which the tiles or stones have to be carted, and in some 
measure according to the nature of the soil. But in most instances, 
after the tiles are laid down on the field, a fall of 18| feet, includ- 
ing price of tiles, cutting and filling the drains, costs about 9d.

Avr is the post-town and nearest market. It is six miles from 
Coylton village, three miles from the north, and fourteen miles from 
the south extremity of the parish. The chief part of the produce is 
sold in Ayr. But Maybole and Old Cumnock, each about ten miles ; 
and Tarbolton and Mauchline, the former six, the latter nine miles 
distant, afford, in their periodical fairs, other facilities for trade.

Kilmarnock fourteen, and Irvine fifteen, miles from Coylton, are 
occasionally resorted to for the same purpose. Till lately, a con- 
siderable traffic was carried on with the Glasgow and Paisley 
markets. Cheese, butter, pork, eggs, poultry, meal, &amp;c. were 
bought up over the country and conveyed to these marts. Al- 
though no one in Coylton is now employed in this trade, it is car- 
ried on by others, who make their weekly rounds in the district ; and 
in this way, there is a regular communication with Glasgow, which 
is thirty-five miles distant. Edinburgh, Cumnock, and Ochiltree 
carriers pass through the parish weekly; and there is a stage-coach 
from New and Old Cumnock to Ayr, that goes and returns by 
Coylton, every lawful day. There is also daily communication 
with Ayr by means of carters employed in the coal trade. Still 
some inconvenience is felt from the want of a post, or regular daily 
carrier. 

The great line of road from Ayr to Dumfries passes through 
the centre of the parish ; and from the same point, roads branch 
off in all directions to the adjoining towns and villages in the 
county. There are fourteen miles of turnpike roads in the parish, 
and five turnpike gates, at Crossbill, Dykneuk, Broadhead, Pot- 
terhill, and Dalmacow. It may give an idea of the thoroughfare 
in the parish, and serve other purposes, to mention their rental. 
The Dykneuk bar on the Dalrymple road, which is not much 
travelled, is let along with the Crossbill gate, which is the chief 
one ; and their rent for the present year is L. 2.39 ; Broadhead for 
same term, L. 145; Potterhill, L. 30 ; and Dalmacow gate, L37. 

The chief lines of road are repaired by a blue whinstone from 
Cloquherrnan quarry, which costs 4s. 6d. per cubic yard. The 
annual expense of upholding that part of the Ayr and Dumfries 
road which is in Coylton, is about L. 30 per mile. The Dal- 
rymple turnpike, L. 6 ; and the road on which the Broadhead toll- 
bar is placed, L. 8 per mile. 

The extent of parish roads upheld by the conversion-money is 
11 miles, 2 furlongs, 177 yards. The amount of conversion- 
money from land is L. 49, 8s. 6d. ; that from householders is 
variable and uncertain. The sum realised from land and 
householders last year, and applied to the parish roads, was L. 52 
14s. 2d. • ' 

Considerable attention is now paid to the keeping of these 
roads. They are under the care of the surveyors for the Ayr and 
Mauchline districts. They still admit of being greatly improved;

and the value of the estates in the upper part of CoyUon would 
unquestionably be enhanced, if these and the private roads to the 
farm-steads were made a little more after the modern fashion. 

The chief village in the parish is Joppa. It contains 173 in- 
habitants; Coylton village, 40, Knockshoggle, 109, Gadgirth- 
holm, 50, Craighall, 100. ' ' 

Eeclesiastical State.- — Little is known of the early history of the 
church of Coylton. It belonged originally to the Bishopric of 
Glasgow. Chalmers in his Caledonia has given the most correct 
account of what has been discovered since the beginning of the 
sixteenth century. " At that time," he tells us, " when James 
IV. refounded and enlarged the establishment of Chapel Royal 
at Stirling, he founded two of the prebends from the revenues of 
the Church of Coylton, in equal divisions. These prebends 
were sometimes called Ayr prima, and Ayr secunda, and some- 
times Coyltoun prima and Coyltoun secunda, the patronage 
whereof belonged to the King. At the Reformation, these pre- 
bends were held by John Ross and William Angus, two of the 
canons of the Chapel Royal of Stirling. The whole of the tithes 
and revenues of the church of Coyltoun were let on lease by them 
for L. 80 yearly, which they shared equally ; and out of which, 
each of them paid L. 6 to the chaplain or vicar, who served the 
cure of the parish of Coyltoun." So far Chalmers. For some 
time after the Papal Faith ceased to be the established religion of 
the nation, the Church of Coylton appears to have been connect- 
ed with the see of Dumblane. And when Episcopacy was abo- 
lished in the reign of Chales I., that king executed a charter up- 
on the 3d November 1647, by which he transferred the revenues 
of several parishes in Ayrshire and Coylton seems to have been 
one of them, to their respective Presbyterian ministers. 

At this time, a Mr William Scott was minister. He is the 6rst 
after the Reformation who is noticed in the earliest existing re- 
cords of the presbytery of Ayr. He was settled in 1642, and de- 
posed in 1651. From that date till the year 1687, there is a 
blank in the records of presbytery. From 1689 downwards, the 
following were ministers: Mr John Mair, inducted 1689; John 
Hunter, 1692; William Boyd, 1700; John Key, 1723; David 
Shaw, D.D., 1749 ; John Black, LL.D., 1810 ; Alexander Dun- 
can, 1826. 

The present church was built in 1836. It is a handsome little 
edifice, in the Gothic style: and in point of conveniency and

comfort, a model for a place of worship. The design was by David 
Bryce, Esq. Edinburgh, who made it to suit the views of the late 
John Hamilton, Esq. of Sundrum. This gentleman, who took a 
warm interest in whateverhe thought would promote the improvement 
and well-being of the parish, besides gifting the site, contributed, 
by extra advances, to finish it in a very substantial and tasteful 
manner. It has a square tower upwards of sixty feet high ; and a 
bell very superior to what is attached to most country churches. 
Its weight is about 12 cwt., and it cost L. 100. The church 
contains 744 sittings, none of which are let : 576 are appropriat- 
ed by heritors and their tenants, and 168 considerately left free 
to accommodate the feuars, cottagers, and poor. Although the 
church is in the centre of the parish, the great distance of some 
parts, and other causes, prevent, in bad weather, the attendance 
from beins- so regular as it otherwise would. 

All the inhabitants are connected with the Established Church, 
with the exception of six families, who are Roman Catholics ; one 
belonging to the Rehef ; one to the United Secession ; one to the 
Associate Synod of Original Seceders ; and two or three individu- 
als in the capacity of labourers or servants, connected with one or 
other of these bodies. For the last six or seven years, the ave- 
rage number of communicants in the parish church has been 500. 
The average amount of collections for the last three years, de- 
ducting mortcloth dues, &amp;c. is L. 56, Is. 5d. For several years, 
there have been regular contributions from the parish, for religious 
and educational purposes. These, till lately, exceeded L. 24 an- 
nually. Of this amount about L. 1 8 have been yearly transmitted 
to the funds of the General Assembly's Schemes. 

The manse is new, and very commodious. It was built in 1839, 
in the most substantial manner. The stipend is 23 bolls, 3 firlots, 
1 peck, 3j lippies bear, 8 Winchester bushels per boll ; 42 bolls, 
1 firlot, 3 pecks,. 1 lippies, meal; and L. 192, Is. 2d. Sterling. 
The glebe, including the garden and site of manse and offices, 
amounts to 6 acres, 3 roods, and 26 falls, Scotch measure, and is 
of L. 12 yearly value. 

Education. — There is one parochial school, in the centre of the 
parish, although not perhaps of the population. In a parish so 
narrow, and extending five or six, miles on each side of the parish 
school, it is impossible it can be accessible to many children till they 
are some years beyond the age when the work of education should 
be commenced. From this cause, private schools for elementary 
branches have at various times been set up in different parts. There 



G64 



AYRSHIRE. 



were three of these till lately. There is at present only one ; it is 
in the village of Joppa, and attended by fifty at an average. The 
teacher has a free school-room, but otherwise depends entirely on 
the school fees. There is cause to regret, that some do not' see 
the necessity of keeping their children at school a sufficient length 
of time, and with constancy, during that period of life, when the 
difficulties of learning are most easily overcome. The profits aris- 
ing from the work of children in the fields and coal mines, and from 
service, are temptations which we fear are sometimes yielded to, 
when the plea of necessity can scarcely be urged. The parish 
teacher has L,30 of salary, the legal accommodation, and statutory 
extent of garden ground. 

All the native population can read ; but there are a few from 
the sister island, who unhappily have not this invaluable art; most 
of these, however, show a laudable zeal for the education of their 
children ; and Roman Catholic parents evince no reluctance to 
send their children to our schools. 

There are two Sabbath schools, — one kept in the church, the 
other in Joppa. A village library was set on foot a few years ago, 
but the number of volumes is yet very limited. 

Poo7' and Parochial Funds. — The number of paupers, reckoning 
children as well as parents and adults, on the permanent roll, in 
the years 1835, 1836, and 1887, and the total amount distributed 
to them, each year, are as follows :

Those here mentioned, only get coals at the beginning of the year 
to the amount specified, but cannot be viewed as paupers, — never 
having applied for parochial relief. An assessment is occasionally 
levied. It is paid solely by the heritors according to their valued 
rent, and raised by the session-clerk at a varying per centage. The 
first assessment was in 1817. The sum usually raised is L. 20. 
This was not always required annually. 

The average collections for the three years preceding the as- 
sessment in 1817 was, for 1813, 1814, and 1815, L.39, 13s. 9d.J 
for 1835, 1836, and 1837, L.SD, lis. 9d.

The number of paupers has considerably increased within the 
last fifteen years. This has been partly owing to the want of em- 
ployment for aged indigent females, since the erection of spinning- 
mills ; partly to a decreasing reluctance to apply for parish aid ; 
and to other causes. 

Inns, c. — There are eight houses licensed to sell spirits and 
ale ; a number far greater than necessary. The facility of obtain- 
ing ardent spirits, and the immoderate use of them, are undoubt- 
edly among the chief causes of the immorality, disorder, poverty, 
crime, and misery, witnessed in many parts of our country. 

Fuel. — A few peats are dug and used in the upper part of the 
parish, but this is done from choice. Coal, of which there is the 
greatest abundance in the parish and neighbourhood, is almost the 
only fuel. It is got at the pits at 6d. or 7d. a creel, or 6s. per. ton. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 

Since last Account was written, the inhabitants have, from the 
causes already noticed, doubled in number. A very considerable 
change has taken place in their dress and manner of living. The 
manufactures of woollen, cotton, silks, and most kinds of clothing, 
have very generally supplanted home made articles. The products 
of the East and West, the baker, grocer, and confectioner, have 
greatly superseded the oaten cake and homely fare of our ances- 
tors. A corresponding alteration may be witnessed in the style and 
comfort of houses and furniture. The soil and agriculture of the 
parish have undergone great improvement. A better svstem of 
cropping is now followed; new kinds of corn have been introduc- 
ed ; turnip and potato husbandry has advanced ; draining of all 
kinds has been very extensively practised ; new plantations have 
been made ; farms-steads built on a larger scale, and after more 
approved plans ; roads have been greatly improved ; and there are 
facihties of communication with near and remote parts of the coun- 
try, that were formerly unknown. Still, there is great room for 
advancement.

THE REV. DAVID WlhSO-ii,—FuUarton, 



I. — Topography and Natural History. . 

Name. — This parish derives its name from a small green hill 
adjoining the village, on which stand the ruins of an ancient feu- 
dal castle. The etymology of the word is so obvious as to require 
no explanation. But who the Celtic chief was, that gave his 
name to the hill or fortlet, cannot now be ascertained. 

Extent and Boundaries. — Dundonald is situated at the north- 
west extremity of the district of Kyle, the middle division of the 
county of Ayr, The parish, though still comparatively extensive, 
was even more so, both before and after the Reformation, than it 
is at present. At the time of the Reformation, in addition to the 
chapelry of Crosby, it included also the parish of Riccarton. And 
when the latter, after the downfall of Popery, was constituted a se- 
parate parish, Dundonald comprehended the lands of Caprington till 
they were united with Riccarton about the middle of last century. 
According to the earliest ecclesiastical records, Dundonald with 
its two chapelries was granted by the sectJnd Walter the Stewart 
in 1229, to the Gilbertine Convent of DalmulUn, near Ayr. And 
when this was given up in 1238, it passed to enrich the monastery 
of Paisley, of which it continued an appendage till the time of the 
Reformation. Crosby, which has still the remains of a church 
and burying-ground, does not appear, as is generally supposed, to 
have been erected into a separate parish, but has always been in- 
cluded in Dundonald, except during the short interval betwixt the 
years 1651 and 1688, when it was annexed to the parish of Monk- 
ton. It is said by Chalmers, that Riccarton at the Reformation was 
joined to Craigie, and only became a separate parish in 1648. 
Upon what authority he makes this statement, we do not know 

• Drawn up by the Rev. Alexander Willison. 



DUNDONALD.

out he must be mistaken, as we find in the Session records as 
early as 1604, several distinct references to the kirk-session of 
Riccarton. 

The parish, according to its present limits, is very nearly of the 
form of an equilateral triangle, the length of the side of which is 
about seven miles. On the south-west side, it is bounded by the 
shore of the Frith of Clyde, which, passing over the point at 
Troon extending nearly a mile into the sea, runs almost in a 
straight line from the point at Irvine harbour to where the Rum- 
bling and Pow burns meet, and separate it from the parish of 
Monkton. On tlie north, it is bounded by the water of Irvine, 
separating it from the parishes of Irvine, Dreghorn, and Kilmaurs, 
and from the district of Cunninghame. On the south-east it 
has no natural boundary, but runs in a straight line from a point 
on the Irvine a little below Caprington, to the above-mentioned 
point on the coast westward, on which side it is bounded by the 
parishes of Riccarton, Symington, and Monkton. 

Appearance. — Within these limits, the surface is marked by a 
very pleasing variety of appearance. All along the sea coast and 
the banks of the Irvine for a considerable way inland, the soil is 
almost a dead level, or very gently undulated. But with a view, 
as it were, to make amends for this tiresome monotony, it rapidly 
swells up, towards one concentrating point, into eminences be- 
twixt three and four hundred feet above the level of the sea. 
These form the Clavin hills, so called probably from the Celtic 
" Clai bheinn," signifying broad-swords, which, when laid in a 
particular form, give a good idea of their appearance. From the 
tops of these eminences, there is a most delightful prospect, said 
to comprise parts of fourteen different counties ; and it is ques- 
tionable if, from an equal elevation, so fine a natural panorama, 
both for richness and extent, is any where to be met with in the 
lowlands of Scotland. 

At the foot of one of these hills, forming a rocky precipice, and 
well skirted with wood, lies the village of Dondonald, This 
with the adjoining grey ruins of the castle crowning an eminence 
in front of the village, gives it a very picturesque appearance. 
There is only one thing wanting to complete the picture, and 

• It was supposed at one time, that the town of FuUai ton belonged to the parish 
of Irvine, having been joined to it in 1690. But, on a question being raised regard- 
ing the support of the poor, it was decided by the Court of Session in 1823, that' the 
proper forms of law had not been complied with, and so it still remains a part of 
this parish. ' '

that is water ; the village being shut in from the sea by the inter- 
vening hills, while there is scarcely a stream deserving the name 
of a rivulet in the parish. This defect, however, tells more upon 
the eye than upon the comfort of the inhabitants; for, the soil be- 
ing generally retentive, excepting towards the shore, sprints are 
everywhere abundant, and the water is in general good, thouo-h in 
some places strongly impregnated with carbonate of iron. 

Climate. — There is nothing very remarkable or peculiar in this 
respect, beyond what is characteristic of the district in which the 
parish is situate. We are not quite sure that it will altogether jus- 
tify the wit of the English gentleman, who, having procured a few 
•Ayrshire cows, declared, " that he was obliged to have water pour- 
ed over them daily to preserve their health," but it is certainly 
very moist. As a compensation, however, it has the advantage 
of being proportionably mild, so that snow seldom lies for any 
length of time ; and, upon the whole, it may be considered as fa- 
vourable to health and longevity. 

Geology. — The parish, as a whole, belongs to the coal-forma- 
tion, and constitutes a part of the great coal measures of Ayrshire. 
Freestone, of course, is found in abundance. There are only two 
places, however, where it is wrought, at Craiksland and CoUennan. 
The quarry at Craiksland yields a very fine and durable stone, 
which may be raised of almost any size. As there is little demand 
for it in the neighbourhood, it is chiefly exported, and in consider- 
able quantities, to Ireland, for purposes of ornamental architecture. 
A steam-engine has lately been erected at]the quarry, for sawing it 
into slabs for pavement, which has succeeded according to expecta- 
tion. On the estate of Curreath, hone-stone is found in abundance, 
and is said to be of a very superior quality. But it has never been 
wrought to any extent, though liberal offers have been made to the 
proprietor to this eff'ect. Immediately above the hone, there is 
the appearance of a small seam of black chalk, but whether it 
exists in any quantity has not been ascertained. Coal, for a great 
number of years, has been wrought to a considerable extent in two 
places in the parish — Shewalton, and Old Rome, formerly called 
Rumford. At the latter work, the depth of the shaft is 37 fa- 
thoms, and cuts through four different seams, which lie in the fol- 
lowing order : 

At the bottom of the shaft is a seam of blind or charred coal, 
3 feet 4 inches in thickness ; 13 fathoms above, there is one of 
common coal, of the same thickness ; 8 fathoms above that, one of 



DUNDONALD.

6 feet ; and 2 fathoms higher still is one of 2 feet 8 inches. At 
the Shewalton work, the depth of the shaft is 35 fathoms, com- 
prising two seams of common coal, the lower of which is 34 inches 
thick, and the other, 16 feet above, 43 inches, including 1 foot of 
hard black till, which divides it into two unequal parts. The two 
works are in other respects very closely assimilated, the dip and rise 
in both averaging about one in sixteen. The roofs in many places 
are bad, being composed of a hardish clay, which quickly dissolves 
on exposure to the atmosphere. In the blind-coal seam, fire-damp 
is of very frequent occurrence, and demands of the workmen the 
strictest attention to the use of the safety-lamp. 

The strata, in many places, are very much deranged by the in- 
tervention of greenstone dikes, and a stone called by the workmen 
alchemy, which cross each other in all directions. Of the former 
of these substances, the Clavin hills are composed, and, in the 
words of a reverend geologist, " are but a greenstone dike on a 
large scale," forced by old Titan bolt up through the surround- 
ing beds. This is the only part in the neighbourhood where it 
appears on the surface, except on the coast, at the point of Troon, 
and the Black rock a mile to the south, at which places it is of a 
much coarser quality, and very much resembles dark granite in 
appearance. At the former place, there is a small bed of fire-clay ; 
but, in point of utility, it is not considered of much importance. 
All along the higher ground, the soil is chiefly clayey. On the 
low flat land, again, it is principally composed of pure moss or 
sand, and appears in many places, for some miles inland, to have 
been, at some distant period, washed by the sea. 

Zoology. — In addition to the domestic animals, which are in no 
respect different from those in the neighbourhood, the parish 
abounds in all sorts of game, such as hares, partridges, snipe, 
blackcock and pheasants. Woodcock also, in considerable num- 
bers, frequently make their appearance in their regular seasons. 
As for rabbits, owing chiefly to a large warren along the shore, 
belonging to the Duke of Portland, which is but imperfectly en- 
closed, they were till within a year or two, as locusts in the district, 
and devoured every green thing. So numerous were they from the 
sandy natureof the soil, and the strict protection which they enjoyed, 
that the proprietors were obliged, for their own interest, to proceed 
against them with a war of extermination. They are still very nu- 
merous, notwithstanding, in some parts of the parish, and to many 
a subject of grievous complaint. A few years ago, there was a well-

stocked deer-park on the estate of Auchans ; but the deer have 
all been removed to Eglinton. At the mouth of the water of Ir- 
vine, and along the sea coast at Troon, salmon are regularly caught, 
but not in such numbers as to render the fisheries of very great 
importance. Indeed there are no fisheries of any kind worthy of 
attention. Oyster scalps, however, might, ih some places, be 
cultivated with advantage, and we wonder why this has not been 
attended to. 

Amongst animals of a ruder sort we may mention the following : 
The otter {Litira vulgaris is occasionally met with, and the seal 
{Phoca vitulina has a favourite haunt on a rock in the sea not far 
from roon. Of water-fowl, the heron {Ardea cinerea, the so- 
lan goose or gannet {Sula Bassana, the sheldrake Tadorna vul- 
garis, the great northern diver [Colymhus glacialis, the her- 
ring gull {Lorus argentatus, occasionally frequent the coast. The 
common wild-duck is found in great numbers ; and less frequent- 
ly the teal. So far as we are aware, there is only one kind of poi- 
sonous reptile, the common adder, {Vipera vulgaris, which is 
found occasionally in Shewalton moss.

Forest Trees. — The parish contains no extensive plantations, 
but it is generally well wooded, except towards the shore between 
Troon and Irvine, where the appearance is very bleak. The trees 
are of the usual forest kind, and thrive well where the soil is good, 
though none of them have attained to a remarkable size. At Au- 
chans there is a considerable extent of natural wood, and near the 
old mansion-house some fine specimens are visible. 

II. — Civil History. 

This parish, from having been once the domain and residence 
of kings, acquires a deep historical interest. But we are sorry 
to say that the authentic historical records regarding it are both 
scanty and obscure. The first historical notice we have of the 
place, is in the time of the third Walter the Stewart, who was 
styled " of Dundonald," and was made Justiciary of Scotland by 
Alexander II., at St Andrews, in 12.30. It is said, however, by 
Chalmers, that the manor and parish belonged to Walter, the son 
of Allan, the first Stewart, who held the whole of the northern 
half of Kyle, in the beginning of the reign of William the Lion ; 
and that it might have been granted to him by David I., or his

successor, Malcolm IV. Nothing more is known or even conjec- 
tured regarding it, until the reign of Robert II., who appears, by 
several cliarters dated at Dundonald, to have made it the place of 
at least occasional residence, from 1371 till the time of his death 
in 1390. This later event is particularly mentioned by the Prior 
of St Serf's Inch, Lochleven. " ' 

The secownd Robert of Scotland Kyng 
As God purwaid maid endyng 
At Downdownald In his countre. 

Of a schort sickness thare deyd he." — Wynton, B. ix. c. 10. 

That his gentle, but ill starred son and successor, Robert III., 
died in the same place, is also asserted by the same author ; and 
though his authority on this point is disputed by Pinkerton and 
Fourdoun, there are others of no mean authority, such as Ruddi- 
man and Macpherson, who stand up in defence of the testi- 
mony of the poet. But, be this as it may, there cannot be a doubt 
of his continuing to reside here some time after his father's death: 
and it is probable, that it was honoured by occasional visits from 
his royal successors, till the time of James IV. From the prede- 
cessor of this monarch, James III., Allan, first Lord Cathcart, 
obtained the custody of the castle, with the dominical lands, in 
1482, and with this family they may be supposed to have con- 
tinued for some time. The next account we have of it is in 
1527, the date of a charter from James V., confirmatory of one 
probably given in his minority, and granting it in right of posses- 
sion to a person of the name of Wallace, a cadet, in all likelihood, 
of the family of Craigie, see Robertson's Ayrshire Families. 
In this descent it continued till 1638, when the proprietor, who 
appears to have teen deeply involved in the troubles of the time, 
by taking an active lead in the covenanting interest, made it over 
by sale to Sir William Cochrane of Cowdon, the ancestor of the 
present Earl of Dundonald.f In 1726, it passed again into the 
possession of the Eglinton ftimily, with whom it still continues; 
and all that now remains to the Dundonald family, is merely the 

 The reader may remember an anecdote connected with this ruin, which, per- 
haps has rendered it more famous than all its history : that when Dr Samuel 
Johnson on visiting the spot, was informed by Boswell of the fact abovcmeniioned, 
he made the old arch ring with a peal of derisive laughter. This was probally only 
meant to humble the national jjride of his Scottish friend. But if otherwise, it was 
unworthy of the mind of the gifted moralist. _ - r c,„,-e 

t We take this to be the date of transfer, mstcad of that given in the former Statis- 
tical Account, which is two years later ; because that date is given without authority, 
and we find Sir William's name entered in 1638, as a member ot the kirk session, 
which could scarcely have happened before the purchase of this estate, as it was his 
only bond of connection with the parish.

mouldering walls of the castle, with the mount on which it stands, 
extending to about six or eight acres of land. 

Heritors. — It is rather a singular fact, that, of all the heritors 
who signed the Solemn League and Covenant in 1638, scarce- 
ly one descendant has now an acre of land in the parish. The 
M'Kerrells of Hillhouse are the only family who have retained pos- 
session of their patrimonial estate in any thing like an entire shape. 
The date of the original grant or purchase is unknown, but it is 
supposed to have descended in regular succession for 500 years. 
The Fullartons, the "Wallaces, the Cunninghams, and the Coch- 
ranes, once all dominant, have long since given place to others, 
but, for the consolation of heraldry, to families not less old- and 
honourable than themselves ; as will be seen from the followino- 
list, which we give in the order of their valued rental : Lady Mary 
Montgomery, lady of Sir Charles Lamb, Bart. Auchans ; His 
Grace the Duke of Portland, Fullarton ; Sir John C. Fairlie, 
Bart. Fairlie ; the Right Honourable David Boyle, Lord Pre- 
sident of the Court of Session, Shewalton ; Henrv M'Kerrell, 
Esq, of Hillhouse ; Colonel Crawfurd, Newfield ; Miss Mor- 
rice of Craig, Holms ; J. Deans Campbell, Esq. of Curreath ; 
Colonel M'Gregor of Caprington ; Colonel Fullarton of Bar- 
tonholm, town of Fullarton ; James Campbell, Esq. of Craigie, 
Broadhirst ; Mr Dickie, Loans ; Colonel Kelso of Dankeith, 
Burgh of Irvine, Friar's Croft All the principal heritors have 
residences either in or adjoining the parish. 

Parochial Registers. — These, as in most other parishes in Scot- 
land, from the accidents of time, but more especially from the slo- 
venly way in which they have been originally kept, are in a very 
imperfect state. The oldest volume, containing the records of ses- 
sion, and bearing date 1602, is" tolerably entire; nay, strange 
to say, much more so than any of the succeeding ones. It extends 
over a period of forty years, comprising a silent interval of six- 
teen years, and contains a great deal of parochial information that 
is curious and interesting. Among other entries of this kind, 
are minutes of the trial of Patrick Lowrie, Warlock, and Cathrine 
M'Teir, demit of witchcraft. These seem to have been cases of 
peculiar interest, and considerable judicial difficulty, from the mi- 
nute detail of evidence adduced," and the length of time they ap- 
pear to have been under trial. The attention of the session was 
more or less occupied by them for nearly five years, — a term which 
would now-a-days do no small honour to a chancery law-suit. Not-

•witlistanding all this trouble however, matters seem to have been 
left just where they began ; no decision being recorded, probably 
from the parties leaving the parish, as we see, from one part of the 
evidence, they threatened to do. For the curious in such matters, 
we shall subjoin one or two extracts, on different subjects, from 
this interesting volume. 

The volume from which these extracts are taken contains a re- 
cord of a different, and to Scotchmen at large, of a more interest- 
ing kind, namely, the Solemn League and Covenant, to which are 
attached no fewer than 222 signatures. But of these, which is a 
lamentable proof of the low state of education at the time, 179 
are- subscribed by proxy, because, as is stated, " they could not 
wryt themselfs." It appears, however, that the eyes of the peo- 
ple were beginning to open to this defect, as we find them making 
arrangements two years afterwards, in 1640, for forming what may 
be considered the first parish school. The articles agreed on 
at a public meeting held for the purpose, and to be subscribed by 
the teacher on admission to office, are certainly curious enough. 
The luckless man of letters was to be any thing but a free agent ; 
for there was scarcely a part of his duty, even the most trifling, 
which was not laid down to him by rule, and according to which 
he was not commanded to walk on pain of deposition. The hours of 
teaching and recreation, the tasks for the children, the deport- 
ment to be borne towards them, the kinds of punishment, even 
to the particular sort of birch to be used, with the exact parts of

the body to which it was to be applied, are all made the sub- 
jects of minute description and legal enactment. What would a 
teacher now-a-days think, if he were gravely called upon to sub- 
scribe such an article as the following " Tlmt he shall attend 
at all hours when the children are in school, and not suffer him- 
self to be withdrawn by drinking, playing, or any other avoca- 
tion." And more especially, when he takes a glance at No. 4, 
and sees that these hours in the winter months are from sunrise 
to sunset, and in summer from seven o'clock morning till six even- 
ing, without even the benefit of a Saturday's recreation. And 
that on the very Sabbath itself, he was to be always present in 
church with his little flock around him, to see, as the record bears, 
that they conducted themselves with propriety, and gave due at- 
tention to the ordinances of religion, of which examination on the 
following day was strictly to be made. 

The minutes of session, after the conclusion of this volume, till 
within the last few years, have been very carelessly and imperfectly 
kept. The next entry after 1643 is in 1702, the commencement 
of another volume. And for more than half a century after this 
date, there are scarcely ten consecutive years of their transactions 
recorded. The register of baptisms, extending to four volumes, 
begins in 1673; that of deaths, in one volume, in 1763; and that 
of marriages, also in one volume, in 1823. The first of these is, 
in comparison, tolerably correct. But the other two are very in- 
correct, and hopelessly so, until more stringent measures are taken 
to compel the people generally to attend to such matters. 

Antiquities.— In this department of inquiry, the Castle of Dun- 
donald claims the first place. The date of the edifice is unknown ; 
but the probability is, from the style of the building and other cir- 
cumstances, that it is indebted for its origin to the craftsmen of the 
twelfth or thirteenth century. As a ruin it is still comparatively 
entire, and would have been much more so, if it had had only the 
Goth Time to struggle against; but the hand of man has also been 
sorely against it for many generations. According to a tradition, 
which the appearance of the edifice seems to confirm, an entire 
storey was removed to build the house of Auchans, which is itself 
nearly a ruin : and from time to time almost every available 
piece of freestone has been carried off. Though these systematic 
depredations are now discontinued, the hand of mischief is still 
occasionally at work. So that if it be true, as we have heard on 
good authority, that the family of Dundonald hold the adjoining

piece of land in grant from the heirs of Eglinton, on condition of 
keeping the ruin from further decay, we must say that the terms 
of the tenure are not very strictly complied with. The building, 
two entire storeys of which still hang together, roofed in by a rude 
arch of ruble work, is in the form of an oblong square, and entirely 
without ornament. It is chiefly built of greenstone from the ad- 
joining rock, with corners and port-holes, &amp;c. of freestone, not 
superior, as when the former Statistical Account was written, 
to any found in the parish. But, as it is only of late years 
that the freestone quarries in the parish have been wrought, 
it must have been brought from a considerable distance. The 
length of the building without the walls is 113 feet. The 
breadth 40 feet. At the south end, is the keep or prison, consist- 
ing of two or three miserable looking arched cells nearly filled up 
with rubbish, which apparently form a distinct compartment, but 
are in reality a part of the original building. On the western wall, 
the arms of the Stewarts, with those of some of the more powerful 
barons, are carved in alto relievo, but are so obliterated by time as 
to be almost undistinguishable. Parts of the wall, both of the 
outer and inner courts, are still standing, and appearances of a 
mound or fortification running round the whole, and of a moat at 
the bottom of the hill, are distinctly to be traced. Previous to 
the Reformation, the castle contained a chapel dedicated to St 
Ninian, with an endowment annexed, the patronage being vested 
in the prince ; but no remains of it are now to be discovered. We 
shall leave these dry bones of once proud and living architecture, 
with the quotation of a popular rhyme regarding them, which lavs 
claim to a high antiquity. The verse is certainly descriptive enough 
of the castle as it stands; but if it is as ancient as is supposed, it 
must have reference to a still older fortlet, which is generally be- 
lieved to have occupied the same site. 

" There is a castle in the wast, 
They ca' it Donald's din ; 
There's no a nail in it ava, 
Nor yet a timmer pin " 

In 1240, the family of Fullarton erected and endowed a convent 
of Carmelites on the site now occupied by the town of Fullarton. 
The convent, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, continued 
to flourish till the time of the Reformation. See Alton's Sur- 
vey. The last prior, Robert Burn, foreseeing the approaching 
storm, alienated the lands, which went under the name of Friar's 
Croft, to Fullarton of Dreghorn. No traces of the edifice or of

the ancient mansion-house of its founders, which stood close by, 
are now to be found. And the only circumstance which gives a 
decided locality to the building, which at one time was disputed, 
was, that when the grounds some years ago were feued out for 
buildinof, the foundation of the convent walls were discovered on 
digging, about fifty yards west from the old place of Fullarton. 
For a more particular detail, see Robertson's Ayrshire Families. 

Tradition says that a chapel once existed at a place called Cha- 
pelhill, close by the mansion-house of Hillhouse. The ground, 
which is now covered with wood, has still some traces of such an 
erection. In the garden wall, which was built nearly a century 
ago, the font-stone is still pointed out. Such a tradition, even 
without any visible evidence, may almost be viewed as a certain- 
ty, from the history of the age to which it refers ; when every ba- 
ron of any wealth or influence was a kirk-builder on his own ac- 
count, and prided himself in having his private chapel. And the 
M'Kerrells were influential enough at that time to lay claim to 
such a piece of religious state. 

On the line of railroad passing through the farm of Barassie, a 
part of the same property, an earthen urn was found in 1839. It 
was filled with the usual complement of calcined bones, and from 
the coarseness of the material, and rudeness of the workmanship, 
it seems rather to have been of British than Roman manufacture. 
It was unfortunately broken in the course of extraction, and the 
fragments have found their way into the private museum of Colo- 
nel Blair of Blair. 

At Kemplaw, on the estate of Lady Montgomerie, are the ruins 
of a vitrified fort. It stands on a projecting eminence formed by 
two ravines ; but is in such a complete state of dilapidation, that 
the form of the edifice is entirely effaced. A few weeks ago, a 
piece of iron was discovered imbedded in a block of vitrified stone. 
It is about four inches in length, bent at one end, and exactly in 
the form of an ear-ring-drop. The position in which it was found 
would indicate accident rather than design ; but to what purpose, 
either of ornament or utility, it could have originally been applied, 
we cannot even conjecture. We believe it is intended to send it 
to the Mechanic'. Museum at Ayr. 

Close by the mansion-house" of Newfield, are what are said to 
be the remains of a Roman bath or reservoir. As the place is 
flooded with water, except during a very dry season, we have not 
been able to inspect it personally, and therefore cannot indulge 
the antiquarian with a descri ption of its form.

The only other relics of antiquity worthy of notice are two old 
encampments on the heights above the farm of Harpercroft. " 'J'he 
largest of these," in the words of the former Statistical Account, 
" contains within a circular embankment of loose stones and earth, 
ten acres of ground, and there is an inner circle of the same kind, 
and from the same centre, which incloses one of these acres. The 
other encampment is about 200 yards distant. No artificial work 
has been raised on its north-east quarter, the steepness of the de- 
clivity being a sufficient defence. But on the south and west, 
the circular embankment is strong, and within is a platform 
not exceeding an acre in extent." The construction of these 
works is popularly ascribed to the Romans, though the absence 
of the ditch or fosse may be considered by antiquarians as 
conclusive against this opinion, and it is believed that all un- 
doubted remains of Roman encampments are of a rectangular 
form, as might be expected from the minute description given by 
Polybius, Lib. i. On suggesting, however, to a gentleman con- 
nected with the parish, of long military experience and considera- 
ble antiquarian research, the possibility that the prevailing opinion 
might be correct, he said, " That the same thought had often oc- 
curred to himself— that he considered the Romans too wise a peo- 
ple to adhere with mathematical strictness to any one form of en- 
campment, and that this would naturally vary according to the na- 
ture of the ground on which it was raised." This is the opinion 
of an intelligent soldier, who knows what fighting means ; and we 
think it has at least common sense to support it. But whether 
they are Roman or Scandinavian, we pretend not to decide. The 
only way to settle the question satisfactorily, would be to send the 
ploughshare through them in search of old coins, or fragments of 
armour ; a mode of investigation perhaps not quite to the taste of 
the genuine antiquarian ; but one which time may nevertheless ere 
long bring to pass. 

Buirdings. — Of these, there are none of a public kind, except 
the churches, deserving of any notice. There are, however, se- 
veral mansion-houses of plain, but handsome appearance. Fullar- 
ton, Fairlie, Shewalton, Newfield, Hillliouse, and Curreatb, are 
all comparatively modern buildings, suited to the extent of their 
respective estates, and kept at present in very good repair. The 
material of which they are built is chiefly whinstone — this being 
most abundant ; but freestone, of late years has been principally 
used, even in edifices of much humbler pretensions, where out-

ward appearance was a matter of consideration. The house at 
Auchans, which bears date of 1644, is of a very irregular and gro- 
tesque appearance. As a mansion-house, it is now in a state of 
hopeless disrepair, and is occupied only in compartments by cot- 
tars : this, in point of taste, is much to be regretted, as a finer 
situation for a handsome building and residence is scarcely any 
where to be found. From the orchard adjoining this mansion, went 
forth the fruit which has long been known over Scotland as the 
Auchans' Pear. The tree originally came from France, and was 
blown down, in a good old age, by a storm about sixty years ago. 

III. — Population. 

Of the increase which, in this respect, has taken place over the 
country generally, this parish has had its full share, as will be seen 
from the following returns : — 

In 1 755, the population was 983 

1791, . . 1317 

1801, . . 1240 

1811, . . 1610 

1821, . • . 2482 

1831, . . 5579 

And, from the Government returns of the present year, it is 6691, and is divided as 
follows :— 

Town of Fullarton, . . 2813 

Do. of Troon, . . 1409 

Village of Dundonald, . 345 

Do of Old Rome, . . 256 

Do. ofShewalton, . . 219 

Do. of Loans, . 205 

Country, including hamlets, . 1444 

This increase is to be ascribed to general causes ; but particu- 
larly of late years to the erection of the harbour at Troon, and the 
consequent increase of its trade ; and also to its becoming a fa- 
vourite place of resort for sea-bathing quarters. 

The condition of the people generally, but more especially in 
the landward districts, is comparatively everything that could be 
desired. In the town of Fullarton, where hand-loom weaving is 
the principal occupation, and at the two collieries, from the prover- 
bial thoughtlessness of this class of labourers, much destitution, 
both temporal and spiritual, undoubtedly exists. Still even the 
worst in these respects are not more so than their neighbours, and 
not so bad as we have witnessed in many other districts. As a 
whole, the people are orderly, intelligent, comfortable as to food 
and raiment, and contented with their condition, except when some 
wiser heads would persuade them to the contrary; " but even that, 
they dinna mind it lang." 

IV. — Industry. 

Agricultwe. — We suspect our statistics in this as in several 



C80 



AYRSHIRE. 



previous points, will be more than a twice-told tale ; for Ayrshire 
is " cows and dairy produce" all over ; and the parish, in this 
respect, may be considered as a thrifty cadet of the dairy- house 
of Dunlop. The greater part of the land is under cultivation, and 
comprises almost every variety of soil which is anywhere to be 
found. In these circumstances, the system of tillage is by no means 
uniform. On the loamy and light soils, which are adapted for 
green crop, the modern rotation is generally followed ; but on the 
stiff clayey land, where this is impracticable, the usual rotation is, 
two white crops after six years pasture, with a top-dressing when 
the soil is broken up. Wheat has been grown for some time in 
considerable quantities ; but, from the badness of the seasons, of 
late years, it has been greatly given up, and it is questionable if, from 
the incurable dampness of the climate, it will ever become a pro- 
fitable crop. Stall-feeding, in one or two instances, has lately 
been introduced; but it is not likely to be generally adopted, and 
one proprietor, at least, has set the example of flaking sheep upon 
turnips, elsewhere found so beneficial, and for which much of the 
agricultural land in this parish is particularly adapted. 

Produce. — To give this with any approximation to exactness, is 
nearly impossible ; for it is seldom known even to the farmers 
themselves. It can only be inferred from the rent paid, and what- 
ever may be the system of agriculture followed, they will ge- 
nerally be found in nearly the same proportion. The valued rent 
IS L. 6411, 10s. 9d. Scots. The real rent, as given in the former 
Statistical Account, L.6100 Sterling, and at present, it is fully 
double this sum. The highest rent of land is L. 4 per acre; but 
this is far above the average rate. The produce of a cow may be 
estimated at L.8, 10s. and from the dairy, it is considered that 
the entire rent should be raised to give the farmer a fair return for 
his capital and labour. 

Fa7'ms and Farm- Buildings. — All the land under regular culti- 
vation is well subdivided with hedge-rows, and in some place's with 
drystone dikes. The farm-steadings in general are comfortable 
and commodious, many of them having been either rebuilt or re- 
paired of late years. The only defect seems to be in neatness of 
arrangement, which is little attended to even in modern erections. 
But it is not easy to change old tastes ; as is well illustrated by 
the shrewd reply of a farmer of the old school, who lived before 
the invention of bone dust. On being requested by his factor to 
have his dung-hill removed a little farther from his door-step, he an- 



DUNDONALD. 



681 



swcred, " Na,na, Sir, when a farmer thinks shame o' his midden, and 
a beggar o' his meal-pocks, its time they were quitting the trade." 
The highest rent paid by one individual is L.1000 a-year ; but 
with this exception, and one or two more, of from L.400 to L.500, 
the farms are generally small, averaging from L. 100 to L. 200 a- 
year. The tenants, however, may all be considered as thriving in 
their way, and we have no doubt of their continuing to do so if 
steadiness and industry contribute to success. The common length 
of leases is nineteen years, on a stated money rental. In one or 
two cases only, it is paid by the fiars. 

Improvements on Land. — These may be divided into two kinds 
— such as have been made upon land formerly under cultivation, 
and such as have tended to the reclaiming of that lying waste. In 
reference to the former, tile-draining has been the main cause of 
melioration. This was introduced into the parish, and, indeed, 
into Scotland generally, by the Duke of Portland, in 1826. Since 
this date, 272 acres upon His Grace's estate alone have been 
thoroughly drained, and principally at his own expense. The 
system adopted here, and, we believe, over all his extensive estates, 
is, to drain the land at the application of the tenant, with the ex- 
ception of carting the tiles, on the condition of an annual payment 
in proportion to the distances betwixt the drains. At 18 feet 
apart, the rent is 3s. and at 15 feet, 7s. per acre. These terms 
we consider very equitable for both parties ; and their advantages 
for the tenant especially, may be estimated by the fact, as stated 
to me bv one of themselves, that he had drained land at his own 
expense, on a lease of three years, and considered that he reaped 
a safe remuneration. Though His Grace's system is not gene- 
rally followed, yet almost all the proprietors give more or less en- 
couragement, which is visible in the extensive operations at present 
going on ; and, if they continue to proceed as they are doing, the 
time is not distant when the whole parish will be as dry as a 
garden. There is one singular fact well-ascertained, in regard to 
tile-draining, that it is unfavourable to the growth of beans. The 
cause is unknown, but it is at present under close investigation. 

In regard to the reclaiming of waste lands, of which more than 
2500 acres are still untouched, much has also been done. In the 
sandy districts along the shore", the hilly nature of the surface is 
the main obstacle. The levelling process is carried on by a ma- 
chine in the form of a scoop, drawn by horses over the hillocks, 
and forcing the sand before it into the hollows, which is found to 



682 



AYllSIUllE. 



be both the cheapest and most expeditious mode of operation On 
the ground thus prepared, better crops are raised than niiht be 
expected, and such as to give encouragement to proceed with 
the improvements. In operating upon the ShewaUon moss con 
sistmg of about 1200 acres, though promising perhaps a bet'ter re- 
turn m the end, much greater difficuUies require to be overcome 
the reason, we suppose, why it has so long been neglected. The 
Lord President, however, the principal proprietor, is setting to 
It in right earnest. But as the moss is still in a growing state, al- 
most a dead level, supposed in some places to be nearly 30 feet 
deep, and in all probability requiring to be drained to the foun- 
dation, a considerable time must elapse before it is entirely re- 
claimed. The large trunks and limbs of black oak which are found 
in a solid state very little below the surface, present also conside- 
rable impediments to the plough, even on the outskirts of the moss. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 
Means qf Communication.—Theve is no market-town in the pa- 
rish ; but this is scarcely felt as an inconvenience, the distances to 
Kilmarnock and Irvine being only five miles respectively, and that 
to Ayr not more than eight, and the roads in every direction good. 
Indeed, there are few parishes of equal extent so well accommo- 
dated in this respect. The turnpike road from Irvine to Ayr runs 
through the parish along the coast, passing midway betwixt Troon 
and Dundonald; that to Dalmellington starting at the same point, 
runs through the village of Dundonald ; and these, again, are in- 
tersected nearly at right angles by the Kilmarnock and Troon 
road. In addition to these, there are parish roads in every direc- 
tion, kept in tolerably good repair, and affording every requisite 
means of communication. The only thing that the mounted tra- 
veller has reason to complain of is the abundance of tolls ; but, as 
the toll seems to be indigenous to the county, let us pay and 
pass on ; for in this case we fear there is very little hope of 
writing them down. The accommodation of a bridge over the 
river Irvine, at the ford near Dreghorn, is much needed, and there 
is a prospect of this being accomplished at an early period by the 
contributions of the neighbouring proprietors. 

Post-Office. — The post-office at Troon is the only one in the 
parish ; but, though it is of little service to the parish generally, 
the defect in the case of Fullarton is supplied by its proximity to 
the town of Irvine, and the village of Dundonald is accommodated 
by the Troon runner passing through it daily to Kilmarnock. As 



DUNDONALD. 



683 



for the dwellers in the other districts, they are left to find and for- 
ward their letters as they most conveniently can. 

Railroads. — Of these there are two in the parish. The older, 
which is more properly a tram-road, being formed of flat rails with 
flanges, was constructed by the Duke of Portland in 1810, for 
conveying coal from Kilmarnock to Troon. The principle is bad, 
and it is standing in need of constant repair ; yet, from the quan- 
tity of coal conveyed, it still continues, we believe, a very profita- 
ble speculation. The waggons are drawn by horses, and carriages 
for passengers pass two or three times a-day ; but more frequently 
during the summer months. The other, the Glasgow and Ayr 
line, passes through the parish along the sea coast for nearly eight 
miles. The part from Ayr to Irvine was opened in the summer 
of 1839. The whole line was opened in 1840. Since this 
date, the whole system of travelling has been completely revolu- 
tionized, as if by magic ; and, when one hears of the paucity of 
travellers a few years ago, which was insufficient to support a rus- 
tic one-horse conveyance betwixt Irvine and Ayr thrice a-week, 
and compares it with the numbers who are flocking to and fro at 
all hours of the day, he is almost led to wonder what moving spi- 
rit can have come over the people, and what they can have found 
to do. A very neat and commodious station-house has been erect- 
ed a mile from Troon, the nearest point of the line ; but a branch 
is now in progress to connect it with the harbour. Another sta- 
tion-house has been built at Fullarton, on a more extensive scale, 
principally for the accommodation of the li-vine passengers. 

Harbours. — Of these there are also two properly within the pa 
rish, those of Irvine and Troon. As the former in all probability 
will be fully described in the Account of the parish to which it be- 
longs, our remarks upon it shall be few. The date of its original 
charter is very old ; but it has not proportionately increased in im- 
portance. The harbour being situate at the mouth of the Irvine 
is secure from the winds ; but the depth of water is only from 10 
to 1 1 feet. The number of vessels belonging to the port is up- 
wards of 30, from 50 to 100 tons register each. The principal 
trade is in coal, as will be seen from the following returns of im- 
ports and exports for the year ending 10th October 1840. Im- 
ports, barley, 225 quarters; milled do., 100 cwts. ; beans, 1231 
quarters; oats, 12,317 quarters; oatmeal, 11,620 cwts.; pease, 
1174| quarters; wheat, 4036| quarters ; flour, 1117 cwts. Ex- 
port of coal, 43,693 tons.

creek of the port of Irvme, ,s a work of much later erection. The 
ongmal charter was obtained from Queen Anne in 1707 bv W 
l-am FuUarton of that ilk ; but it remained for a w o,e cL y 
entn-e y a dead letter According to the former Account, t is r7 
ported, that, about th.date, "an offer was made to thepropr tor by 
the merchants of Glasgow for feuing the adjoining laL, and pro 
ceedmg w.th the work ; but that their offer was rejeLd for a reason 
vh,ch, however nd.culous it may now appear, Jould be consider 
ed very cogent n. those days-lest a rise should take place on the 

dII fCl" 'T\ 7''' when Z 

Duke of Po Hand, who had previously purchased the estate of 
 u la ton entered on the undertaking, which has cost from first to 
1 .t about L. 100,000. The harbour, for depth of water and rea- 
dine s of entrance, is one of the best in the neighbourhood, being 
apable of admitting vessels at low water, dralg from 15 to it 
eet. It IS rather defective, however, in point of security, especi- 
ally when the wind blows from the north-west, as was proved dur- 
ing the disastrous gale of January 1838, when twenty-two vessels 
were driven from their moorings, all of them being more or less 
damaged and a few totally wrecked. This is a serious evil • but 
It IS capable of being remedied at an expense not very formidable 
for such an undertaking, and it would be of the greatest advantage 
to the harbour to have it completed. A wet dock is at present in 
course of excavation from the solid rock. There are two dry 
docks ; the larger, about 300 feet in length, is capable of admit' 
ing vessels of the first class. The trade is chiefly in coal and tim- 
ber. Ut timber, about 3000 tons are imported annually ; of coal 
conveyed by the Kilmarnock railway for export, the quantity for 
the year 1839 was 130,500 tons; and during the quarter endina- 
7th November 1840, it was 19,480 tons. The vessels belonging 
to the port are fifteen in number, amounting to 3800 tons reo-is 
ter, besides six vessels belonging to the port of Irvine, whose ton- 
nage is 1300. The harbour has a good lighthouse supported from 
Its own funds ; and on the Lady Isle, lying towards the bay of Ayr, 
but belonging to this parish, the merchants of Glasgow, more than 
half-a- century ago, erected two pillars for the direction of vessels. 

Ecclesiastical State.— Till within a few years, the people were 
very ill provided with church accommodation. The parish church, 
which was built in 1803, and is in very good repair, contains only 
OSO sittings; and its distance from Fullarton and Troon— the 



DUNDONALD. 



685 



nearer of which is four miles,— would, in any case, have rendered 
any thing like a regular attendance upon ordinances altogether 
impracticable. This defect was remedied in the case of Troon in 
1837, and in that of Fullarton in 1838, by the erection of two 
handsome places of worship on the Church Extension principle, 
each containing 900 sittings. Both of these churches have or- 
dained clergymen, with quoad spiritualia districts assigned. 

The stipend of Troon at present is L. 150, and that of the 
other, guaranteed by bond, is L.88, 6s. 8d., which, in both cases, 
is raised from the seat-rents and collections, except L.20 of the 
former, which is paid by the Duke of Portland. The parish of 
Dundonald ecclesiastically contains now a population of only 
1307, with 500 communicants; Troon contains 2186, with 500 
communicants; and Fullarton 3071, of whom 400 are communi- 
cants. The seats in the parish church are all rent-free, being mostly 
allocated to the tenantry. In Troon, 120 are free, and the rest are 
rented from 3s. to 7s. each. In Fullartort, 100 are free, and the 
average rate of those rented is 2s. 6d. Neither of the clergymen 
of the new parishes has either manse or glebe. The manse of 
Dundonald, which was built in 1784, is, considering the wear of 
time, in tolerably good repair. The offices have lately been en- 
larged and improved, and are, consequently, in better order. 
The glebe is only four and a-half acres, including the site of build- 
ings and garden ; but the land is good, and very productive. 
Previous to 1792, the stipend was 100 bolls 14 pecks of meal, 
32 bolls 1 1 pecks of bear, Ayrshire measure, and 20 merks Scots. 
That year, an augmentation of L.25, 3s. 2Jd. was granted by the 
Court, with L.5 additional for communion elements. In 1824, 
it was augmented to the present amount, consisting of 17 chalders, 
half meal, half barley, and L, 10 for communion elements. The 
free teind still amounts to fully L.600. 

Besides this provision for clerical instruction, the parish has had 
the benefit of a resident missionary, connected with the establish- 
ment, for the last ten years. He resides in the village of Dun- 
donald, and labours among the families at the three coal-works of 
Shewalton, Old-Rome, and Gatehead, in the parish of Kihnaurs. 
The funds for his support are raised by local subscription ; but 
the burden falls chiefly on the Misses Muir, formerly of Shewal- 
ton, to whose Christian beneficence the parish has long been un- 
der the greatest obligations. 

There are in all about 1886 Dissenters belonging to different 



686 



AYRSHIRE. 



denominations, but consisting cliiefly of Burghers, Relief, Baptists 
and Roman Catholics. Of these, 1400 belong to Fullli ton and 
attend worship in the town of Irvine, 250 to Troon, and 136 to 
Dundonald. In the year 1840, about 100 members belonoina to 
the United Associate Synod procured a place of worship in Troon 
which was used as a mission station before the building of the pre- 
sent church, and have now an ordained pastor, who is the only 
Dissenting clergyman in the parish. For the accommodation of 
the Roman Catholic population, who are almost all Irish labourers 
the priest, who resides at Ayr, and is under the superintendence' 
of the bishop at Glasgow, pays regular monthly visits to Kilmar- 
nock and Irvine, and sometimes more frequently. 

Schools.— Besides the parish school, which has the legal accom- 
modation of a good house and garden, and L.28, IBs. 9|d. of sa- 
lary for the teacher, there are seven others in the parish, the most 
of which have small temporary endowments, and are under the 
same clerical superintendence. One of these was lately organized 
at Fullarton, in connection with the church, and has a salary of 
L.15 from the General Assembly's Education Committee. A 
school-house to contain 300 children, is in the course of erection, 
at an expense of L.500. This sum was procured from the legacy 
of the late Rev. Dr Bell of Madras, by the kindness of the Lord 
Justice General one of the trustees nominated by that benevolent 
individual for the distribution of his ample fortune for educational 
purposes, and who has always taken the deepest interest both 
in the spiritual and temporal welfare of the district. Another 
school-house is also in process of building at Troon, for the ac- 
commodation of 230 children. The estimated expense is L.335, 
one-half of which is paid by Government, and the other by sub- 
scription. The average number of scholars at the parish school 
is 60, and at all the other schools together, 640. The rate of 
wages for the elementary branches of education varies from 2s. to 
4s. 6d. per quarter. In addition to these means of instruction, 
there are several Sabbath schools, which are very numerously at- 
tended ; and all that is now wanting, in this respect, is only the 
placing of those schools already in operation on a more independ- 
ent and permanent footing. — A parochial library was established 
in the village of Dundonald in 1836, and contains about 150 vo- 
lumes. It is in two divisions, adult and juvenile, and the annual 
payments are 4s. and 2s. respectively. 

Poor and Poor's Funds. — The number of poor at present on the

roll is 94, which is, perhaps, rather a large amount. But on look- 
ing into the old session-records, we are not sure if matters, in this 
respect, are worse than they were. In the year 1643, we find 
that sixty-three persons were licensed by the session to beg with- 
in the bounds of the parish, which, considering the supposable 
amount of population, is a much greater proportion than at pre- 
sent. The average rate of weekly allowance is Is. 4|d. which is 
raised in the usual way, from parish dues, church collections, in- 
cluding the stipulated sum of L. 4 from Fullarton, and an optional 
one of from L.7 to L.IO from Troon, and a voluntary assessment 
of the heritors. The collections at the parish church for the last 
year were L.32, and the assessment Is. per pound Scots of va- 
lued rent. Besides this, there are two mortifications of L.90, and 
L.45, the former under the management of the session, and the 
latter under that of the Fullarton Indigent Sick Society. The 
interest of each sum is distributed among five poor families not on 
the roll. The above may be considered a very scanty provision, 
but there are few parishes where more is done in the way of pri- 
vate charity. All the principal heritors are liberal in the distri-- 
bution of coal and clothing, and other necessaries. In this, they 
are generously seconded by the farmers and inhabitants generally ; 
and there cannot be a doubt, but that the claims upon their cha- 
rity are becoming more and more urgent. What may be the rea- 
son, we know not, but sorry we are to say, that the good old spirit 
of Scottish independence, which once spurned the kirk-box, as al- 
most worse than starvation, is fast dying away, and that few in- 
deed now think it any degradation to have their wants so supplied. 
This is surely a symptom of change not for the better, and as it 
is, from accounts, very generally manifested, we trust it will meet 
with due consideration from those whose especial business it is to 
provide and legislate for the poor. 

Fairs. — No fairs are now held within the parish, unless an 
annual cattle-show, which takes place at Dundonald in the month 
of May, can be called such. 

William Fullarton of that Ilk, in a charter dated 1707, and to 
which we have already referred, obtained the power of erecting 
the town of Fullarton into a burgh of barony, with two annual 
fairs, on the third Wednesday of July, and first Thursday of No- 
vember, old style. We are not aware whether the charter in this 
latter article was ever acted on ; but it is now a dead letter, and

the proximity of tlie place to the town of Irvine has obviously 
been the cause. 

Inns.— The number of these would seem to a stranger rather 
like a slur on the morality of the inhabitants, being not less'than 
50. But let It be considered that all of them, with the excep 
tion of seven, are located in the two seaport towns, and are prin- 
cipally frequented by persons who do not belong to the parish 
This, however, to a philanthropist is a poor consolation, and in 
any case it is to be regretted that such things should be The 
grand Turk has levelled the haunts of the opium-eater; the 
heathens of China have obstinately waged war against its impor- 
tation ; and surely a government calling itself Christian ouo-ht not 
to make gain, both of the temporal and spiritual degradatio"i of its 
people. 

Fuel— The parish possesses both peat and coal in abundance. 
The former is little used. The latter, which is raised chiefly for 
exportation, sells at Is. a load, which weighs about four cwt, and 
is of a very good quality. 

Miscellaneous Observations, 
We may mention generally, under this head, that the condition 
of all classes, even of the poorest, has very much improved since 
the date of the former Account. An entire new town and harbour 
have risen up at Troon ; two railroads have been constructed ; 
common roads have been formed, and all much repaired j what 
were little better than mud-walls have given place to substantial 
stone and lime, and in many places to elegant architecture. The 
comfortable, but unstable, thatch has been supplanted by slate ; 
the fertility of the soil, by a better system of culture, has been 
inconceivably improved. Money with all ranks is much more 
abundant ; and all these things tell upon the comfort, as we would 
hope they do upon the gratitude, of those who enjoy them. As to 
the moral condition of the people, we have not the same means of 
judging ; but, glancing at the records which are scattered over a 
period of two centuries and a-half, we find that every generation 
has had its virtues and its vices, and we would suppose that the 
people at present are neither much better nor worse than their 
predecessors. The parish, and we think happily, is still free from 
factories of every kind; the attempt referred to in the former Ac- 
count having completely friiled. And as a lover of those among 
whom one would choose to dwell, one would say, long may such 
attempts continue to fail I For while agriculture and the kindred

arts are favourable alike to the physical and moral health, there 
is obviously something in such employments destructive of both. 
And if experience has proved them to be injurious to men, they 
are a cruel bondage and degradation to the feebler sex. It is 
enough to make one's heart sick to look upon their wasted figures 
and colourless countenances, when compared with those who la- 
bour for their immediate bread in the pure light of day. But this 
evil, we fear, is, from the nature of things, without hope of remedy. 
The moral one, however, may be prevented ; and should the root 
of it at any time be transplanted into this district, we trust that a 
moral and spiritual education will also keep pace with it, that 
the people may at least sink no lower, or become worse than they 
are.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ROBERT URQUHART, MINISTER. 



1. — Topography and Natural History. 

JSfame. — Kilbirnie, the ancient as well as the modern name of 
tliis parish, is obviously compounded of the common Celtic prefix 
Kil, signifying a church, cell, or hermitage, and Birnie or Birinus, 
the name of the saint to whom the church was dedicated. Though 
this saint conferred his name on the parish, his festival or anni- 
versary, which fell on the 3d of December, has long since been 
forgotten, whilst that of St Brandane, the apostle of the Orkneys, 
is still commemorated on the 28th of May, under the modernized 
appellation of Brinnan's-day, the great annual fair of Kilbirnie. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The parish is bounded on the north 
and east by Lochwinnoch and Beith ; on the north-west by Largs; 
and on the south and west by Dairy. It is of an irregular oblong 
figure, in length from south-east to north-west between seven and 
eight miles, and of the medium breadth of about two miles and a-

half; The area is computed to be equal to seventeen square miles, 
or 8,576 Scotch acres. 

Topographical Appearance.~T\\e surface of the parish presents 
in general a pleasingly varied, if not a strikingly diversiged, appear- 
ance. It may be described as consisting of two naturally well- 
defined sections, viz. a lower and altogether "an arable division, 
and a more elevated and extensive one, combining with a consi- 
derable portion of arable land a great extent of green hill-pasture, 
bog, and moorland. The lower section, lying in the position of 
north-east and south-west, along the boundaries of the parishes of 
Beith and Dairy, is partly flat, especially towards the south-west, 
but more generally its surface is varied with gently-marked swells 
and depressions. This division, which is nearly four miles in 
length, and about the medium breadth of a mile and a-half, does 
not, therefore, possess any striking features, unless it be the 
bright expanse of Kilbirnie Loch, extending along two miles 
of its eastern confines, and the winding course of the water of 
Garnock, which flows through its upper part from north to south, 
but which, after passing within a quarter of a mile of the south- 
west extremity of the loch, forms the eastern boundary of the 
lower part. West and north-west of this fertile and highly-culti- 
vated division, the ground assumes a much greater variety of posi- 
tion and form ; in addition to which, it rises somewhat rapidly, un- 
til it swells into airy upland pastures considerably beyond the reach 
of cultivation. These verdant uplands are succeeded by dreary 
tracts of moss and heath, and irregular ranges of dusky hills, of 
an extent equal to fully one-third of the superficies of the parish, 
and taken altogether, compose a region, doomed alike by climate, 
inaccessibility, and soil, to hopeless sterility. The lowest land in 
the parish is about ninety-three feet above the level of the sea, 
and the highest, which is the Hill of Staik, situated on its north- 
west boundary, has an altitude above the same level of 1691 feet. 
From the summit of this hill, the most elevated in the district of 
Cuninghame, as well as from several of the adjacent heights, 
panoramic prospects of an extent, variety, and magnificence, "may 
be enjoyed, unsurpassed by any thing in the west of Scotland. 

Climate and Diseases. — That the climate of this district is not 
insalubrious is sufficiently evidenced by the generally healthy con- 
dition of the natives, and ■ the advanced age which many of them 
attain. The prevailing winds being from the west and south-west, 

• Scotch incasure is invariably alluded to in this Account.

are frequently surcharged with vapour ; and as the high lands of 
this parish are among the first to arrest a portion of their mois- 
ture, the consequent rains are frequent, and often heavy and con- 
tinuous. There are no peculiar diseases incident to the locality ; 
the most prevalent are fevers, rheumatisms, and occasionally con- 
sumptions, which can scarcely be attributed to the climate, inas- 
much as the same diseases are to be met with all over Scotland. 
This healthy character will not, however, we are assured, apply 
to the population lately superinduced on that of the village, by 
the establishment of two extensive manufactories. Among this 
portion of the inhabitants, what with the high temperature of the 
factory, enfeebled constitutions, and inattention to cleanliness, 
there is almost ever less or more of typhus fever — an epidemic 
that will never fail to scourge the lower classes of society, until 
they acquire the good sense of preferring nutritious food to whisky, 
and the comforts of cleanliness to dirty and improvident habits. 

Hydrography. — There are numerous perennial springs of ex- 
cellent water in this parish, but none have yet been discovered 
possessing medicinal virtues; that, especially, of Birinie's well, 
situated about a quarter of a mile north of the ruins of Kilbirnie 
Place, to which it had been conducted by pipes, is alike remark- 
able for its strength, and the superior quality of the water. 

jRivers. — The Garnock and the Maich, the latter forming the 
northern boundary of the parish, are the only streams of any note. 
The Garnock rises at the base of the hill of Staik, and traverses 
the district in the direction of south-east. About a mile and a-half 
from its source, it forms a wild and romantic waterfall, called the 
Spout of Garnock, which, after heavy rains, presents an animated 
spectacle, strongly in contrast with the immobihty and stillness of 
the surrounding scenery. Nearly three miles farther down, it 
winds in melancholy murmurings round two sides of the precipi- 
tous knoll, on which are perched the tottering ruins of Glengar- 
nock Castle. Descending thence for a short distance through a 
wooded ravine, it hastens over a rocky channel, and after skirling 
the village of Kilbirnie, quietly pours its accumulated waters 
through a strath of much beauty, in the lower part of the parish. 
It then pursues its devious course through the parishes of Dairy 
and Kilwinning, and, after being considerably augmented by many 
tributary streams, falls into the sea at Irvine. Like other moun- 
tain rivers, a heavy fall of rain renders, in a short time, the Gar- 
nock an impassable torrent, a little way from its source ; while dur-

ing the summer months, it is frequently fordable at nearly all points 
withm the parish. Its banks are tame, presenting, in their whole 
extent, no charms to the admirer of picturesque scenery the im- 
mediate environs of Glengarnock Castle, and of the waterfall 
alone excepted. The right to the salmon-fishing of this rive 
from the Rough burn, a mile north of the town of Kilwinning, to 
the rolgree water, about half a mile below Kilbirnie Kirk, belongs 
to Blair of Blair, having been granted to that family by the mo- 
nastery of Kilwinning, to which it anciently belonged. Above the 
latter rivulet, the fishing of the Garnock is considered free. 

The source of the Maich is close by the south side of the Misty- 
Law in Renfrewshire. It runs in a direction nearly parallel to 
the Garnock, from which it is nowhere more than a mile and a 
half distant. After a sinuous course of about five miles in a deep 
channel, occasionally fringed with natural wood, this "lonely moor- 
land river," enters Kilbirnie Loch from the north, to which it is 
by much the most steady and abundant contributor. 

Kilbirnie Loch lies in the south-east quarter of the parish, and 
constitutes part of its boundaries in that direction. It is a beau- 
tiful sheet of pellucid water, and forms a noble feature in the wide- 
spread landscape. Its banks, though tame, are remarkably clean, 
and, where not adorned with trees, arable fields slope gently to its 
margin. It extends a mile and a half in length, is scarcely half 
a mile in breadth, and its greatest depth is about five fathoms and 
a half. Besides the Maich, the loch receives supplies from the 
Mains and the Bath burns, streamlets which have their sources close 
by the town of Beith ; and its only outlet is by the Dubs Water, 
which discharges itself into Lochwinnoch Loch. It is well stored 
with pike, perch, trout, and eel, an'd is betimes the resort of the 
wild duck and heron. The comparative tranquillity that has hi- 
therto hung over this crystalline expanse, will in a short time be 
invaded by the noise of locomotive vehicles, and other sounds in- 
cident to a great thoroughfare, as the railroad from Glasgow to 
Ayr runs along its east bank. The loch forms part of the estate 
of Kilbirnie, although that property does not extend around one- 
half of its circumference. 

' Kilbirnie Loch is thus noticed by Bellenden, the translator of Bocce : ' In 
Cunninghame is ane loch namit Garnoth, nocht unlike to I.och Doune, full of fischc." 
It xras subsequently called Loch Thankart. In IG28, David Cunynghame of Ro- 
bcrtland is served heir of Dnvici Cunynghame, his father, in the lands and barony of 
Olengarnock " et loch de Loch Thankart." It belonged to the Cunninghams of 
Olengarnock, but the Craufurds of Kilbirnie disputed their right, and, in the spirit 
ot tile times, those families called out their tenants and retainers and broke one an-

Geology — Viewed geologically, the parish is divided intotwosec- 
tious, unequal in extent, and widely different in character. They are 
separated by a line running east and west. The north division, which 
is the largest, occupies an extensive tract of hilly country. It is of 
an igneous origin, and belongs to the secondary trap formation, 
being composed chiefly of greenstone and porphyry ; but except 
to the curious in speculative geology, it presents little that is in- 
teresting. None of the metallic veins usually associated with the 
trap formation have been observed. Agates, however, and other 
simple minerals, are occasionally met with ; and the vein of ba- 
rytes, which is worked in the island of Arran to the south-west, 
and at Muirshiels, in the parish of Lochwinnoch, to the north- 
east, and which has also been discovered in the parish of Kilpa- 
trick, still farther to the north-east, is supposed to traverse this 
district. 

But the most interesting, as well as valujable mineral products 
of the parish, are on the south side of the line indicated. They 
belong to the carboniferous series of stratified rocks, and occupy 
an area of about 1500 acres, stretching along the valley of the 
Garnock. Where the strata have been denuded by streams and 
otherwise, opportunities occur of investigating the sedimentary 
rocks, and this has been done with tolerable accuracy to a depth 
of 120 fathoms. At the depth here mentioned, a limestone post 
of excellent quality, measuring thirty feet, rests upon a bed of 
marl, of unknown thickness. Over the limestone, and extending 
twenty-five fathoms upwards, thinner limestone bands of inferior 
quality prevail, alternating with shale and freestone. The sixty 
fathoms next in succession, besides two layers measuring fifteen 
feet each, formed of ironstone nodules thickly imbedded in shale, 
ijomprehend not fewer than twenty ironstone bands, chiefly argil- 
laceous, varying in thickness from one to thirty inches, with inter- 
vening beds of fine clay, lime, freestone, aluminous schist, and thin 
coal seams. The next thirty fathoms reaching to the surface, con- 
tain four workable seams of coal, a few calcareous ironstone bands, 
with strata of freestone, lime, and shale. 

others boats. Acase between them is reported, 16th July 1626, Mor. Diet. p. 10631, 
from which it appears that hoth parties had the loch included in their titles. The 
Craufurds of Kilbirnie subsequently acquired right to the barony of Glengarnock 
and there was no longer room for dispute on the subject. Sir John Craufurd's right 
was ratified by Parliament in 1641. 

" The lucid and comprehensive account of the geology of the parish here given lias 
been most obligingly contributed by Andrew Craig, Esq., Westfield House, King- 
ston, Glasgow.

AYRSHIRE. 



The coal field is found distributed into basins generally of no 
great extent, sometimes detached, at other times passing inio each 
other by a ridge or undulation, without throwing off the metals. 
The usual dip is one foot in seven. The basins are seldom found 
to correspond altogether in their stratification, and are intersected 
in all directions by faults and dikes, the one dislocating the strata, 
the other merely disjoining them, without altering their level, and 
both, from their frequency, adding to the difficulties of the miner. 
Of course, it will appear that the account here given, is to be re- 
garded merely as an approximation to the general state of the mi- 
neral deposits under notice. 

The coal has been worked for a long time, but never extensive- 
ly. The aggregate thickness of the four workable seams is about 
] 4 feet. The average distance from the surface to the upper 
seam, is 15 fathoms; from that to the second, 6; from the second 
to the third, 3; and from the third to the lowest, 3. The up- 
per seam is peculiar in this respect, that it is found to assume 
quite distinct aspects at different parts of the field. At one point, 
it is the bituminous or cannel coal, now so much in demand for 
the manufacturing of gas ; at another, it is the common free 
coal ; in other situations, again, both descriptions of coal exist in 
connection, the one overlying the other ; and last of all, the two 
coals are found parted by a few inches of black-band ironstone. 
However much the seam may vary in its composition at different 
places, it undergoes no material change in point of thickness, for 
as the one kind of coal increases, the other is found to diminish. 
The three lower coals are composed of free coal : one of them 
known as the smithy coal, is prized for the purposes of the forge, 
and all of them are good household coal. 

The freestone of the district comprehends numerous seams, rang- 
ing in thickness from an inch to eighteen feet. Some of the quar- 
ries afford compact and durable blocks, well adapted for building. 
In the flagstone quarries again, pavement of all dimensions is pro- 
cured at little expenditure of labour. 

The limestone exists in great abundance, is worked to a consi- 
derable extent, and is much esteemed both for building and agri- 
cultural purposes. 

The ironstone has never been turned to account, but is now 
underlease with a view to the establishment of iron-works. Some 
time ago, a carbonaceous ironstone, similar to Muschet's black- 



KILBIRNIE.

band, was discovered in this and the adjoining parish of Dah-y. It 
is situated about thirty fathoms below the fourth coal. It is up- 
wards of two feet thick, and yields about 40 per cent, of metallic 
iron. This and a few of the other bands, it is supposed, may be 
made available for the purpose of smelting. Considerable risk is 
thought to attend the contemplated undertaking, arising especial- 
ly from the nature of the coal, which in this district is of a softer 
quality than any that has hitherto been employed in reducing iron 
ore. Should it be found necessary to subject it, in the first in- 
stance, to the process of coking, much additional expense will be en- 
tailed on the manufacturer, and he will thus be less able to compete 
with others who do not labour under the same disadvantage. If, 
however, the works should prove successful, as it is hoped they 
may, their establishment, on an extensive scale, will doubtless add 
to the prosperity of the district. 

A vein of graphite or black-lead is intersected by the stream 
which divides this parish from that of Dairy ; but no attempt, it is 
believed, has yet been made to ascertain its quality, or trace its ex- 
tent. 

Soil. — The soil in the lower or south end of the parish is a deep 
alluvial loam of great fertility. Ascending the river it gradually 
changes into a rich clayey loam, while to the east along Kilbirnie 
loch and part of the course of the Maich, it is a light red clay, 
resting on a stiff clay subsoil. West of the Garnock, clayey loam 
likewise prevails, and occasionally adhesive clay mixed with sand, 
varied with numerous stripes of meadow ground, almost every farm 
in this quarter having two or more acres of this valuable ground. 
The soil of the higher grounds being incumbent on trap .and lime- 
stone, is light and dry, and its fertility is sufficiently evinced by 
the excellency of the pastures. The moorish uplands are gene- 
rally moss of various depths, resting on a light-coloured clay, and 
the more level parts are n[iuch broken by hags and pools of stag- 
nant water. 

Zoology. — There are no rare species of quadrupeds in this pa- 
rish, nor are we aware that any uncommon remains have at any 
time been discovered. The ordinary wild animals of the country, 
such as the fox, the polecat, the weazel, the stoat, and the hedge- 
hog, are numerous, especially in the higher parts of the parish. 
Th6 otter also frequents Garnock and the loch, during the spring, 
principally for eels, which it seems to live on at that season. The 



696 



AYIISHIRE, 



badger, too, was formerly to be met with in the glens, but it is no 
longer to be found. Hares and the more common species af 
game are numerous, and would become more so, were their illegal 
destruction more effectually checked. 

zVfZ.— Besides above sixty of the common birds of Scotland, 
several of the more uncommon species are stationary here. Of the 
latter, including the rarer summer and winter visitants, the compiler 
of this Account is indebted to Mr John Jamieson, Kilbirnie, a 
skilful and enthusiastic ornithologist, for the following interesting

-F2s/i.— Kilbirnie loch contains trout, pike, perch, roach, and 
eel, the latter especially in abundance ; and of the three first very 
large ones have occasionally been killed. The Garnock and the 
Maich are good trouting streams, particularly the former. There 
would, it is believed, be few rivers in the county equal to the 
Garnock, in this respect, if the unprincipled destruction of the 
fish in its tributary rivulets, during the spawning season, could be 
prevented. Last autumn, one individual caught, by means of a 
stake-bag-net, no fewer than 150 stones. A few salmon ascend 
the river as high as, and even above Kilbirnie, in November and 
December, but they are mostly all destroyed by the night poacher. 
From a variety of causes, their numbers, it would appear, are year- 
ly decreasing. We have been assured that, about fifty years ago, 
salmon were to be seen in the latter end of harvest, sportingin 
every pool of the river above and below the village, and it is but 
rarely now that a few solitary stragglers are to be seen so high. 

Botany — It does not appear that there is any thing peculiarly 
interesting in the botany of the parish. In the lower district, ve- 
getation is rather luxuriant, and by no means deficient in variety ; 
but there are few species of the plants that are generally marked 
as rare in Scotland. The following, however, that are not very 
common, may be found here : 



KILHlilNlE.

Parietaria officinalis Allium ursinum Thalictrum flavum

Sison verticillatum Sedum telephium palchrum 

Chjeropliyllum odorata Prunus padus Inula helenium 

Imperatoria oestruthium cerasus 

The Conium maculatum, hemlock, generally so plentiful, is not 
known in this parish, except in one spot near the ruins of Kilbirnie 
House. The Malvaceae seem to be entire strangers ; only one spe- 
cimen, the Malva moschata, having been found which could not 
be reckoned indigenous. The Ulex Europceus, furze, was not 
known until a few years ago, when it was sown for a fence. 

Plantations. — With the exception of about twenty acres planted 
by the late Mr Cochran of Ladyland, some thirty years ago, and 
eleven acres on the estate of Kilbirnie, along the margin of the 
loch, in 1807, there has been nothing done in this respect, within 
the remembrance of any one, worth noticing. A few thin strag- 
gling belts and detached rows of trees, consisting chiefly of ashes, 
elms, and planes, spreading out in different directions from the 
ruins of Kilbirnie House, are all that now remains of the noble 
sylvan embellishments of the parks and pleasure-grounds of this 
ancient seat of the Crawfurds. There are still a few fine old 
trees around the site of the ancient house of Ladyland ; and the 
modern plantations on that estate, consisting, in a great measure, 
of chestnuts, planes and firs, are thriving in the very best style. A 
few farm-houses too, are partially sheltered by immemorial ashes 
and planes ; but by far the greater part of them are marked by a 
scantiness akin to absolute destitution of such beneficial and orna- 
mental accompaniments. There is thus a great deficiency both 
of old woodlands and modern plantations throughout the parish- 
there being only about seventy-eight acres in all ; a deficiency that 
will not probably be. fully remedied until the principal estate can 
claim a resident proprietor. 

n. — Civil History. 
There is nothing in the history of the parish that can be stated 
apart from that of the more ancient families by whom it has been 
possessed. The few memorabilia of unchronicled conflicts refera- 
ble to a period antecedent to the introduction of Christianity, such 
as tumuli or cairns, have been all, with one doubtful exception, 
removed within the present century. During the long reign of 



698 



AYRSHIRE. 



feudal tyranny, the district of Cuninghame, though occasionally 
disturbed by such murderous feuds as those of the houses of Kil- 
maurs and Eglinton, seems, on the whole, to have benefited by the 
humanizing influence of the church-one of the largest properties 
being that of the Abbey of Kilwinning, while the predatory vio- 
lence to which the border counties, and those in the vicinity of 
the Highlands, were subject, was here unknown. 

Eminent Men.— The only eminent person whom this parish can 
claim, is Captain Thomas Crawfurd, of Jordanhill. He was the 
sixth son of Laurence Crawfurd of Kilbirnie, and Helen, daughter 
of Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudon. He was a brave.and enter- 
prising officer, and his adventurous exploit of storming the almost 
impregnable castle of Dumbarton in 157 1, is familiar to every one 
acquainted with the history of Scotland during the minority of 
James VL This extraordinary feat of courage and dexterity, the 
boldness of which, says Sir Walter Scott, was unequalled by the 
siege of the Numidian fortress mentioned by Sallust, or the more 
modern surprise of Fecamp during the wars of the league, has con- 
ferred deserved celebrity on his name. In consideration of this 
and other faithful services, Captain Craufurd received a grant of 
several lands in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, whence his title 
of Jordanhill, besides an annuity of L. 200 Scots during his life, 
payable out of the priory of  St Andrews. He appears to have 
commenced his military career at a very early age, as he was taken 
prisoner at the disastrous battle of Pinkie in 1547, — which bloody 
event he survived fifty-six years. The latest notice we have met 
with of this celebrated character, into the detail of whose public 
life it would be unsuitable to enter here, is in the year 1581, 
when the king, by a gift dated at Holyrood, grants him L. 100 
Scots yearly " out of the superflue of the third of the benefices 
not assignat to the maintenance of the ministrie." Much of the 
last twenty years of his life was probably spent in retirement, — 
the state of the country no longer demanding his military 
services. It must, therefore, be to some part of this disengaged 
period, that the residence allotted him by tradition at Kersland, 
in the adjoining parish of Dairy, the heiress of which he had 
married, must be assigned. 

In 1594, Captain Craufurd erected a monument to himself and 
his lady in Kilbirnie church-yard, and " bequeathed," says Mr 
George Craufurd, the learned historian of the shire of Renfrew, 
" his body to be buried there." The monument is still entire, 



KiLBlUNiE.

though much weather-wasted. It is built of chiselled sand- 
stone, and is of a quadrangular form, nine feet long, six feet 
in width, and six feet four inches in height, and is covered hori- 
zontally with the same material. Through an aperture in the 
east end, by the aid of a faint light admitted through a slit in the 
south wall, are seen the recumbent statues of the gallant captain 
in military garb, and of his spouse in the costume of the times. 
On the exterior of the north wall, in relieved characters now 
scarcely legible, is the following inscription, every version of 
which hitherto printed has been more or less at variance with 
the original ; — 

God . ScHAW . 
The . RiCHT .

rVRD . OF . KiLBlRNY . 1.5.9.4. 

In the centre of the inscription is a shield bearing quarterly 
Crawfurd and Ker, and for crest a figure, by its irregular outline, 
meant probably to represent a rock, in allusion to Dunbarton 
Castle. Captain Craufurd died 3d January 1603, and was buried 
close to the inscribed wall of the monument. 

Division of Land, c|-c.— The parish was anciently possessed by 
three different families. It is still nominally composed of three 
estates, or baronies, namely, Kilbirnie, Glengarnock, and Lady- 
land; though the two last have been considerably broken up, — there 
being at present twenty proprietors holding portions of them rang-

1. The barony of Kilbirnie has always been by much the most 
extensive of these estates. It occupies the south and most fertile 
quarter of the parish, and consists of about 5500 acres, of which 
nearly 3000 are arable, meadow and woodland. This barony of 
old belonged to a branch of the Barclays of Ardrossan, a family 
of some distinction in the early history of the country. In 1470, 
the line of the Barclays terminated in an heiress, who married 
Malcolm Craufurd of Greenock, the founder of the family of 
Craufurd of Kilbirnie. Their descendants flourished in high re- 
pute for valour, loyalty, and honourable connections, in unbroken 
succession, upwards of 200 years, when the male descent failed in 
the family of Sir John Craufurd, who died in 1661. By his se- 
cond wife, daughter of Lord Carnegie, he had two daughters, the

2. The barony of Glengarnock extends over both sides of the 
npper course of the Garnock, and consists of about 1400 acres, of 
which fully more than 1000 are excellent arable land, and the 
remainder moor pasture. Nearly 700 acres of the best land of 
this barony belong to the estate.of Kilbirnie, along with the supe- 
riority of all the rest. About 420 acres of it are possessed by 
nine different proprietors, all of whom have a right in common to 
a considerable extent of moorland pasture. 

The most ancient possessors of this barony on record were the 
Kiddels, supposed to be descended of the Riddels of Teviotdale,

one of our oldest Scottish families. Of the history of those of 
Glengarnock, all that is known with certainty is, that the line ter- 
minated in an heiress, who, some time previous to 1266, had es- 
poused Hervey Cunningham of Kilmaurs, to whom the peerage 
writers have assigned the honour of having gallantly distinguished 
himself at the battle of the Largs in 1263. Galfridus, the second 
son of this marriage, was the ancestor of the Cunninghams of 
Glengarnock. The early annals of this ancient family are, how- 
ever, very meagre, and, unless it be to the genealogist, altogether 
uninteresting. During the sixteenth century, they become more ex- 
tended, and of the feuds, rencounters, and conspiracies in which the 
lairds of Glengarnock were frequently and evidently with no aver- 
sion engaged, there are many notices recorded. The most rest- 
less and enterprising spirit of his race, seems to have been William, 
the thirteenth possessor of the barony, who closed his turbulent ca- 
reer at the fatal battle of Pinkie, 10th September 1547. His 
will, made on the eve of his departure from his house of Glen- 
garnock to that disastrous field, an interesting document, and 
hitherto unpublished, is subjoined. Sir James Cunningham, 
the sixteenth in descent from Galfridus, who married Kathe- 

 This document, of which a literal translation follows, is preserved in the records 
of the Vicar- General of Glasgow. It is now in the course of being printed for the 

Maitland Club, — the contribution of Williaua Patrick, Esq. of Roughwood : 

" Death is certain — the hour most uncertain. Hence it is that I, William Cunyng. 
hame of Glengarnock, taking my way to rencounter our old enemies, and, in the event 
of sudden death, make and ordain my testament and last will. In the first place, I give 
and leave my soul to Almighty God, the most blessed Virgin Mary, and all saints, and 
my bones to be buried where it shall please the Most High. And I leave iiij pence 
to the fabrick of St Kentigern, and xx pound to be given to a chaplain duly ordained 
to pray for my soul in the parochial church of Kilbirny. Also, I leave to Sir Ho- 
bert Cunyngham, chaplain, x merkis of money ; likewise I leave to the Friars Mi- 
nor of Air and Glasgow, xx merkis. Also, I appoint and ordain that my tenants 
have the liberty of compounding their debts. Further, T appoint my executors, viz. 
Elizabeth Synclair, my wife, and Lady Isabella Cunyngham, my mother only ; and 
I leave my four best horses to my four sons, in such a way that the eldest shall have 
the first choice of the same, viz. ay the eldest to cheis first, and that the heirship horse 
shall stand to my heir for his choice. I leave to Alexander Cunyngham, my youno-er 
son, the younger horse called the ' seur staig,' and to John Blair, my son-in-law, the 
younger horse, called the ' brown staig.' I grant and assign to Elizabeth Cunyno-. 
hame, ray daughter, relict of the late Alexander Schaw of Sauchguy, that sum ot400 
merkis, resting upon the lands and buildings of Sir John Makghe, vicar of Abruth- 
ven, lying within the city of Glasgow ; as also that sum of 200 merkis, owing by the 
said Sir John, I assign to the foresaid Elizabeth, towards relieving my executrices 
of the forementioned sum of 700 merkis due to the said Elizabeth. Moreover, all my 
goods, moveable and fmmovcable, my debts being taken out and paid, I give and leave 
to my three daughters, to be distributed and 'apportioned at the will of my executrices 
aforesaid, as they shall answer to the Supreme Judge." This testament was made by the 
mouth of the departing, " the xxix day of the month of August, in the year of our 
Lord, 1547, my manuel subscription bearing testimony, at Glengarnock." Follows 
the form of subscription, " William Cunyningham of Glcngarnok, with my hand."

rine, daughter of the Earl of Glencairn, assigned, in 1609, the 
lands, of Glengarnock in behoof of his creditors, and went to 'ire- 
land, where he had got a grant of 12,000 acres of land from King 
James VI. A few years afterwards, the estate was sold to Cun- 
ningham of Robertland, whose son being unable to keep it, it was 
acquired in right of a wadset by Adam Wktt, clerk to the Signet, 
from whose successor it was purchased, about 1680, by Patrick 
Lindsay, husband of the heiress of Kilbirnie, and it has ever since 
formed a valuable part of that estate. 

3. The barony of Ladyland occupies the northern quarter of 
the parish, and contains upwards of 1800 acres, of which nearly 
one-half is arable; the remainder, consisting of excellent upland 
pastures, and a considerable extent of moorland. Of the arable 
ground, about 400 acres belong to twelve different proprietors, the 
general extent of whose properties is from 20 to 40 acres each,— 
15 acres being the lowest, and 1 16 the highest that any of them 
possess. They have all a right of pasture over the moorland. The 
great body of the barony belongs, however, to the heirs of the 
late William Cochrane, Esq. of Ladyland. 

Of the more ancient proprietors of this estate, there appears to 
be nothing recorded. Prior to 1564, it had been acquired by a 
branch of the Barclays of Kilbirnie, for, in that year, David Bar- 
clay of Ladyland is one of the jury on the trial of Patrick Hous- 
ton of that ilk, for assaulting Archibald Hamilton of Cochno, on 
the streets of Dunbarton. In 1 592, his son and successor, Hew 
Barclay, was apprehended as accessory to some treasonable con- 
spiracy for " inbringing of Spaniards to the overthrow of his High- 
ness and all professing the true religion." He was imprisoned in 
the Castle of Glasgow, but escaped and went to Spain. In 1597 
he returned and took possession of the rock of Ailsa, which he 
intended to have victualled for the service of his colleagues, but, 
being surprised by his enemies, he ran into the sea and was 
drowned. Hugh Barclay, in his happier days, was the friend 
and companion of Montgomery the poet, and appears himself to 
have written verses, as two of his sonnets have been preserved, 
one of which is addressed to the author of " the Cherry and the 
Slae," and the other to his friend Ezechial Monlgomery.f The 
former of these is full of quaint humour, and shows that the au- 
thor was, at the time of writing of it, in the country, " botching

on a sped," " draiglit in dirt, vhylis wat evin to the skin ;" regret- 
ting his absence from his correspondent, who, with his friends, was 

" birHng at the wyne" and " pouing Bacchus luggis." The 

Barclays sold Ladyland about 1620. The estate was acquired by 
Hamilton of Ardoch, previously to 1669 ; but this family did not 
long retain it, for in 1710, it belonged to a Henry MoncrielF, who 
granted several charters to the vassals of the barony. It was, shortly 
after the above date, purchased by Alexander, ninth Earl of Eg- 
linton, who sold it in 1718, to William Cochran of Edge, by 
whose descendants it is now possessed. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of baptisms and marriages 
commences in the year 1688. A blank occurs between the 9th 
July 1724, and the 5th December 1725, " in consequence," as is 
stated on the record, " of there being no schoolmaster during that 
period;" and another from the same cause, between the 10th Ja- 
nuary 1731, and the 16th March 1732. Again, the register of 
marriages, from the 3d July 1729, to the 15th June 1738, has 
been lost ; but from this date to the present time, there are appa- 
rently no omissions. The registry of deaths begins in 1753, and 
is preserved entire. Minutes of the kirk-session commence also 
in 1688, but there is an unregretted gap in these impure records, 
excepting some Illegible scraps, extending from 1725 to 1791. 
Money accounts in reference to the poor are likewise preserved 
from 1688 to the present time, and minutes of meetings of heritors 
since 1823. 

Antiquities. — Various tumuli have, at different times, been acci- 
dentally explored in this parish, and in some of which urns filled 
with calcined bones have been found, and in others stone coffins 
containing human remains. Early in the century, three stone- 
coffins, but without the addition of any mound over them, were 
discovered on the right bank of the Garnock, about a quarter of 
a mile below Kilbirnie Bridge ; one of them contained a large urn 
filled with burnt bones; but in neither of the other two, nor in one 
opened about the same time on the opposite bank of the river, 
near to Nether- Mill, and close to the base of a large barrow or 
mound, were found any relics whatsoever. About thirty years ago, 
the late Mr Cochran, in the course of his agricultural improve- 
ments, had occasion to remove a slightly elevated tumulus, situat- 
ed on the lands of Ladyland, in the centre of which a small urn 
was found containing ashes. The urn, until lately, was to be seen 
in the Museum of Glasgow College, to which it was presented by 



7C4 



AYRSHIUE. 



Mr Cochran, but it appears now to be either lost or withdrawn 
from that collection. In 1836, a stone coffin, containing remains 
of human bones, was discovered on the farm of Langlands, about 
three-quarters of a mile north of Kilbirnie. The tumulus over 
it was by much the most remarkable object of the kind in this 
quarter. It stood on the level part of" a field, skirted by the 
Garnock on the west, from which it was fifty yards distant. It 
was of a circulair form, 100 feet in diameter, and six feet in height. 
Ongmally, it had been much higher, but, about the beginning of 
the century, a great quantity of stones were taken from its summit 
to form a road in the neighbourhood. What remained of it in 
1830, was composed of stones of various dimensions intermixed 
with earth. Few of these were heavier than a man could carry, 
excepting a row placed seven feet within the line of the base, and 
some three or four feet apart, each of which might weigh half a ton. 
The coffin or chest, which was formed of six flat stones neatly 
fitted together, measured 2 feet 7 inches in length; 1 foot 9 
inches in breadth ; and 1 foot 7 inches in depth. It was situated 
in the centre of the tumulus, and its longitudinal position was north 
and south. It contained nothing but bones very much decayed, 
and the greater part of which lay in its south end. Many of these, 
on being handled and exposed to the air, crumbledinto dust, but se- 
veral of the fragments which have been preserved can be distinct- 
ly recognized as belonging to the human species. In the spring 
of 1837, every vestige of this primeval monument was removed. 

The mound situated at Nether-mill, incidentally mentioned 
above, is of an irregular pyramidal form, about 18 yards in length, 
9 in breadth, and between 5 and 6 in height. It is, we doubt 
not, artificial, and has apparently been formed by excavating the 
adjoining bank, which overlooks it. This opinion, though not 
supported by popular belief or local tradition, is strengthened by the 
unstratified appearance of the composition of the mound, and by 
the circumstance of the stone-coffin already noticed, being disco- 
vered in its immediate vicinity. 

Coin. — In tilling a field last year, near the ruins of Glengar- 
nock castle, there was turned up a silver coin about the size of a 
modern shilling. It is in excellent preservation, having apparent- 
ly been little worn, and weighs about one drachm thirty-five grains. 
The obverse bears the Scottish shield and crown, supported by 
the letters M. and R. Legend, . Maria . Dei . G . Scotor . Regina.

Kilbirnie House. — The stately ruins of the ancient house or 
Place of Kilbirnie, are situated a mile west of the village, and 
overlook a considerable extent of country beyond the valley beau- 
tified with Kilbirnie loch, and fertilized by the Garnock. The 
surrounding grounds fall gently towards this valley, and are varied 
but slightly by a shallow dingle, on the margin of which stands 
the ruined mansion. 

The building, which has been erected at two widely different 
periods, consists of an ancient quadrilateral tower, and a modern 
addition, extending rectangularly from its east side. The tower 
is 41 feet in length by 32 feet in width, and its walls are 7 feet 
thick. Its height has been divided into four storeys, the lowest 
of which is vaulted and without a fire-place. The second con- 
sisted of a hall, 26 feet long, and 18 feet wide, has likewise been 
vaulted, and lighted tolerably by a window in its south wall, and 
another facing the west. Above the hall have been two tiers of 
chambers ; but of their subdivisions there are no traces left. Access 
to the different floors and to the roof, has been gained by a nar- 
row spiral stair in the north-east angle of the building. A way 
fenced with a parapet has gone round the top, all of which has 
fallen down, as well as every vestige of the roof, which was proba- 
bly of the high triangular form, common to such castellated man- 
sions. It is impossible, from any peculiarities in the masonry of 
this feudal tower, to ascertain the period of its construction. The 
absence of gun-ports in its walls, a provision of defence with which 
every stronghold erected subsequently to the use of fire-arms 
was furnished, seems to imply that it was built, at the latest, in 
the early part of the fourteenth century, and consequently, in the 
days of the Barclays, the most anciently recorded Lords of the ba- 
rony. 

The modern part of the edifice was built about 1627, and must 
have proved a satisfactory increase of light and airy accommodation 
to that afforded by the sombre tower. It extends 74 feet, is 
25 in width, and has been three storeys in height, besides the 
attics, the pedimented windows of which have risen above the 
lower line of the roof, as have likewise the hanging turrets at the 
extremities of the principal fa9ade. Much of the exterior walls 
of both parts of the building is still entire ; and, as is frequently

the case in similar ruinous structures, the inost ancient part is 
the least dilapidated. Most of the interior divisions have, with- 
in these few years, fallen down, a few of the vaulted apartments 
excepted, and in these the " lazy steer and sheep," have been 
long permitted to find a shelter. The building was entirely de- 
stroyed by fire accidentally kindled on the 1st May 1757, and 
from which, as it occurred at an early hour of the morning, the. 
Earl of Crawford with his infant daughter and the domestics, 
had little more than time to escape. Eighty years of exposure to 
the weather have much lessened, and greatly enfeebled what the 
fire had spared; while, during this long period, all the contiguous 
pleasure-grounds have been torn up by the plough, or permitted to 
run waste. The noble straight-lined avenue, full twenty yards in 
breadth, has returned to a state of nature : — the gardens situated 
to the west, instead of flowers and shrubs, are allotted to the rear- 
ing of potatoes and turnips ; and of the orchard grounds no traces 
are now to be found. The high walls with which they were en- 
closed are everywhere breaking down, and all the fine old lim- 
ber, which had beautified and sheltered " the Place" for ages, and 
afterwards added much to the grandeur and interest of its ruins, 
has disappeared within the last thirty years. 

Glengarnock Castle. — The ruins of Glengarnock Castle stand 
on a precipitous ridge or knoll, overhanging the Garnock, about 
two miles north of Kilbirnie. This brawling stream skfrts two 
sides of the knoll, and, as the ravine through which it flows is 
fully eighty feet in depth, the position, under the ancient sys- 
tem of warfare, must have combined security with the means of 
easy defence. The only access to the castle is from the north- 
east, in which direction the ridge, upon which it is situated, is con- 
nected with the adjoining field. At the distance of thirty yards 
from its entrance, a depression in the ground indicates what has 
been the course of a dry moat, by which, and a drawbridge, the 
approach is said to have been protected. The ground plan of this 
ancient stronghold could, until lately, be easily traced, and as a 
portion of the exterior walls still maintains nearly the original 
height, its appearance when entire, may, with little difficulty, be 
yet shadowed out. From notes and measurements taken a few 
years ago, it may be described in general terms, as having consist- 
ed of a quadrilateral tower, with a court of less elevated buildings 
extending from its east side. The entrance has been from the 
eastern extremity of the latter. This fa9ade is 46 feet long, 



KIL13IHNIE. 



707 



and has been about 24 feet in height. A court or passage, 59 
feet in length, lay between the entrance and the tower, on each side 
of which has been a range of two-storied apartments. The tower 
is 45 feet long, 33 feet wide, and its height has been above 40 
feet. Its upper and now only accessible storey has consisted of a 
hall occupying the whole extent within the walls, and the imbow- 
ed ceiling of which has been 20 feet in height. It has been 
lio-hted both from the court and from the exterior walls. One of 
the windows overlooks the rugged chasm through which murmurs 
the Garnock, and from two narrow apertures facing the east, the 
e3'e may yet revel over a beautiful extent of the district bearing 
the same name as the old lords of the castle. From the hall, a 
narrow circular stair led to the upper part of the building, which 
has been surrounded by a parapet wall. The ruins show neither 
the arrow-slit nor gun-port of defence so common in similar old 
houses. Perhaps the situation was of itself so secure as to render 
unnecessary the ordinary means of repelling an attack. The uni- 
formity of style in all castellated mansions, erected prior to the dis- 
covery of gunpowder, renders it hazardous to be precise regarding 
the date of their construction. Few, however, conversant with 
such remnants of feudal architecture, would hesitate to assign to the 
ruins of this stronghold, an antiquity as remote as that of any re- 
mains of masonry in the west of Scotland. It is not, therefore, im- 
probable that Glengarnock Castle may have existed in the time 
of the De Morvilles, though the conjecture of its having been the 
residence of these ancient lords of Cunninghame, appears entitled 
to nearly the same consideration as that of its having been the cas- 
tle of Hardyknute. 

It may be added, in justification of so minute an account, that 
the ruins of this castle will soon cease to be an object of interest 
to the local antiquary, or to form a picturesque feature in the 
landscape. The storms of January 1839 overthrew the north 
wall of the tower, containing between 4000 and 5000 solid feet of 
masonry ; and unequivocal symptoms portend, that, at no distant 
date, the bed of the Garnock will receive the greater part of the 
lime- worn remains. 

Ladyland House. — The old house of Ladyland, briefly charac- 
terized by Pont, circa 1609, as a " strong tower," was demolished 
in 1815, with the exception of about 20 feet in length and 25 feet 
in height of its north elevation. This fragment is six feet in thick- 



r08 AYiisiiinf 

ness, and as compact as the solid rock. A pedimented stone, 
which belonged to a door or window of the building, but which is 
now placed over an entrance to the adjoining garden, bears the 
initials W. H. I. B. and the date, Anno 1669. The date re- 
cords, doubtless, the period of some repairs, or perhaps the year 
the estate was acquired by Hamilton of Ardoch, as there cannot 
be a question of the existing fragment of masonry having formed 
part of the " strong tower" noticed by Pont, and in which, a few 
years previously to his visiting the district, had resided Barclay, 
the unfortunate friend of Montgomery the poet, as had likewise, 
probably, all his ancestral possessors of the barony of Ladyland 
In taking down this ancient strong house, there were found, in a ca- 
vity in one of the walls, a little above the foundation, four small 
urns, a painted drinking glass, and a large jaw bone, supposed to 
have been that of an ox. The urns were neatly formed of com- 
mon clay, three of which were tilled with an unctuous kind of earth, 
and one of them, besides the earth, contained the breast and side 
bones of a chicken. Two of the urns had handles, and all of them 
were tightly closed with shreds of trimming or woven cloth, the 
most of which, on being taken out, crumbled into powder. Part 
of these relics are preserved by Mrs Cochran of Ladyland, as is a 
small coin found in the grounds adjoining the tower. The coin is 
of some compound metal, and bears the legend festina lente ; 
but the date and the impress on both sides appear to have been 
effaced by long circulation. 

Modern Buildings.— In 1816, the late Mr Cochran built an 
elegant and commodious house on his estate of Ladyland. It is 
plea;:aiitly situated on a gently elevated terrace or eminence, ly- 
ing along the bnse of the high 'rounds in the north-east extremi- 
ty of the parish, and commands an interesting prospect to the 
south. The adjacent heights protect it from the north and east 
winds, and some fine old ashes, elms, and planes, and thriving mo- 
dern ]lantations, contribute much to shelter and beautify its en- 
virons. The grounds and approaches have been designed with 
much taste, and are kept in excellent order. Taken altogether, 
this is among the most eligible residences of its class, in this sec- 
tion of the county. 

There is no other modern building in the parish meriting, by 
its architecture, especial notice. It may, however, be stated, that 
in 1824 a commodious chapel was built by the congregation of the

maiiuftictory, five stories m height, and a large mill for spinning 
flax,'there have been twenty-one two storeyeddwelling-houses erect- 
ed in the village, during the last eight or nine years. Several of 
the fronts of these buildings are of hewn and polished ashlar, and 
adorned with mouldings and carved decorations, creditable to the 
taste and inventive capacity of their untutored architects.

There are, at present, thirteen proprietors of land of above 
L. 50 of yearly value ; 30 bachelors and widowers above 50 years 
of age ; 40 spinsters and widows above 45 ; 2 fatuous persons ; 
and during the last three years, there have been 10 illegitimate 
births in the parish. 

No nobility reside here, nor have any such resided, since the year 
1769 ; and there is only one genteel family of independent for- 
tune occasionally resident. 

The increase of the population since 1831 has arisen from the 
establishment of a spinning power-loom manufactory, and a mill 
for spinning flax, which employ between them about 500 hands. 

Atthisdate, February 1840 the following crafts and calUngs form 
the active or productive portion of this industrious little community : 
_3 agents for manufactures ; 5 bakers ; 6 blacksmiths ; 100 bleach- 
ers; 12 carters; 30 colliers; 1 cooper; 17 day-labourers; 150 flax-

Character, HaUts, cc.-In the former Statistical Account, the 
habitants were characteri2ed as being « sober, quiet, active n d 
-dustrus," and we doubt not that to this charL the il ha e 
generally a good claim. Since the period referred to, \here ha 
been a marked m.provement in their mode of living_in their ha- 
bits of domestic and personal cleanliness-in their style of dress 
-and above all, perhaps, in their taste and intelligence. In all 
of these respects, they have kept pace with the general advance- 
ment of the country, without losing, we believe, any of the 
moral and kindly feelings for which they were formerly distin- 
guished. Instead of the noisy, and not unfrequently demoralizino. 
gymnastic exercises in which they used to excel, music has o'f 
late years been successfully cultivated by the operatives, as their 
instrumental band sufficiently testifies, and a judiciously se- 
lected subscription library might be adduced as another proof 
ot the intellectual character of the present generation. It cannot 
be doubted that, upon the whole, the people of this parish enjoy as 
many of the comforts and advantages of society as any similarly 
constituted community in the kingdom. Many of them are not 
wholly dependent on their employments; while the resources of the 
poor but industrious artisan are not so soon exhausted in small 
as in large manufacturing towns. The inhabitants, too, seem ge- 
nerally speaking, contented enough with their circumstances, 
though a few of them have of late, in becoming politicians, become 
dissatisfied not only with their own social position, but, strange to 
say, with nearly all the institutions o their country. Thesecon- 
stitute, however, but an insignificant fraction of the population, the 
great body of which is warmly attached to the existing order in 
church and state. To these general observations, weliave only 
to add, that not a few individuals are to be met with here, alike 
distinguished for sound religious principle and good moral practice. 

The illegal destruction of game and fishings has, of late years, 
much decreased in this parish, though there is still, it is said, a 
good deal of the former destroyed by persons maintaining a much 
more respectable status in society, than that held by the daring 
poacher of other years.

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The statements under this head are given with 
confidence, on the authority of Robert Logan, Esq. of Baillieston, 
one of the most spirited and enterprising agriculturists in the dis- 
trict. 

The parish contains in all 8576 Scotch acres, of which there 
were in 1839, 

Under crop, • . 1280 acres. 

In cultivated grass lands and meadows, 2209 

Green-hill pasture, . . 1009 

Heath, moss land, water, &amp;c. . 4000

About 700 acres might be added to the cultivated land, and af- 
terwards kept in a state of permanent pasture ; but this would have 
to be accomplished by the proprietor, as none of the waste lands 
would yield to the farmer a fair remuneration for their improve- 
ment, during the currency of an ordinary lease. There are, in the 
higher grounds, two undivided commons, one of which consists of 
1000, and the other of 500 acres. The right to the pasturage of 
the former belongs to different feuars, holding various portions of 
the barony of Ladyland, and the latter, by a similar right, is pas- 
tured by the flocks of feuars of the estate of Kilbirnie. They are 
of no great value, the land being very poor, and situated far be- 
yond the limits of profitable cultivation. There is no natural wood 
worth mentioning, and to the few detached acres of plantations 
there seems to be little attention given — those on the estate of 
Ladyland excepted, which appear to be regularly' pruned and 
thinned, and their enclosures kept entire. We learn, however, 
that several acres have been recently planted on the estate of Kil- 
birnie, and that it is the intention of the noble proprietor, gradu- 
ally to extend this highly ornamental and. most beneficial accom- 
paniment, especially over lands fit for nothing else. 

Bental — The valued rent of the parish in Scotch money is 
L. 2905, 1 4s. Id. The real rent, as recently made out to fix an 
assessmfent, is L. 6001, 10s. Sterling; and of houses and gar- 
dens in the village L. 1200, 10s. 

Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land is L. 1, 10s. 
per acre, but in the neighbourhood of the village, where the soil 
is very fertile, some fields rent as high as from L. 3 to L. 4 an 
acre. The general allowance for grazing a cow is L. 3, lOs. ; for 
a stirk, L. 1, 5 ; for a ewe or full-grown white-faced sheep, 16s. ; 
and for a black-faced one, 7s.

Live-StocL-The dairy cows in the parish are mostly of the 
Cunnmghame breed, to the selection and rearing of which as well 

;Laid Th T"''" «he dairy, considerable attention 
IS paid. The greater part of the cattle fattened for the bntcher 

are likewise varieties of the Ayrshire snecies Th. c,. . I 
, . ij'MJiit; bpecies. 1 ne sheep pastured 

on the muirlands are the common black-faced kind of the country 
and those kept on the arable farms are crosses of various Eno-lish 
breeds. The farm-horses are chiefly of the Clydesdale breed - 
a race distinguished for strong powers, and of an activity adequate 
to every purpose of husbandry.  

The different species of live-stock are at present as follows • 
horses of all descriptions, 140 ; milk cows, 536 ; rearing and other 
varieties of cattle, 679; black-faced sheep, 1903 sheep of the 
Jinghsh breed, 194; swine, 134. 

Husbandry.-Anmhme has, for many years, been as well un- 
derstood and as successfully practised here, as in any part of the 
country. In the lower and more fertile section of the parish, the 
usual rotation of cropping adopted is, 1., oats; 2d, green crop • 
3, wheat, barley, or oats ; Ath, clover and ryegrass; 6th, pasture' 
during three years. On the more upland farm.s, the rotation still 
iollowed is two white crops, one of hay and four or five years pas- 
ture. This system, though not approved of by modern acrricultu- 
rists, does not want its supporters, where the dairy is a primary ob- 
ject of consideration. 

The following is a tabular view of the extent of crop sown in 
1839, and of the annual average produce per acre, in Winchester 
oolls

Acres under turnips, 31|; under potatoes, 148 ; under sown grass, 
278 ; under meadow hay, 135 ; under flax, 4|. 

Wheat was, for several years, much more extensively cultivated 
than at present ; but, in consequence of repeated partial failures, 
it has been deemed expedient, of late, to restrict its cultivation. 
In 1836, there were from 120 to 160 acres under this crop, and 
the returns averaged 9 bolls per acre. Since that period, the 
average produce per acre has not exceeded 6 bolls. The soil ap- 
pears to be too retentive of moisture, and the climate too humid 
and cold to admit of this fine grain ever being successfully culti- 
vated to any extent, in this quarter. Oats, on the contrary, thrive 
remarkably well, and potatoes, with the exception of three or four 
years' failure, as well as turnips and beans, yield abundant returns. 

The parish is divided into 643 enclosures, and the farms 62 
in all, are of various sizes, the arable ones ranging from 50 to 180 
acres. The lower grounds are mostly enclosed by ditch and thorn 
hedges, and the upper and pastoral lands by high stone walls. 
Fifteen of the principal farms have thrashing-mills, and there is 
one corn-mill in the parish. All the lands are thirled' to this mill. 
The multure exacted for grinding oats raised on the Kilbirnie es- 
tate, is the forty-first peck ; if raised on other lands, it is from the 
fifteenth to the twentieth peck. 

The duration of leases is generally nineteen years, — a term con- 
sidered sufficiently long to permit the tenant to reap the benefit 
of ordinary outlays ; but when improvements are to be made on 
an extensive scale, and much hazardous expenditure is consequent- 
ly incurred, it might be expedient that this period should be ex- 
tended to twenty-five years. 

There are still extant a number of the old, mean, and incom- 
modious thatch-roofed farm-houses, in the construction of which, 
the comfort of the cattle seems to have been as much studied as 
that of their owners. These, however, are gradually being dis- 
placed by larger and more commodious houses, built after regu- 
lar and well-arranged plans. All of those erected on the Kilbir- 
nie estate within the last forty years, along with their attached of- 
fices, possess every convenience their occupants could possibly de-

sire, while others, built on the smaller properties, present, in everv 
respect, an equally strong contrast to the dingy hovels they have 
supplanted. 

Great and striking improvements, by draining, limina, and en- 
closing, have been effected in this parish,.vvithin the present centu- 
ry, by various individuals, and in particular, by the late William 
Cochran, Esq. of Ladyland. This gentleman, besides adding 
considerably to the extent of his arable grounds, by an extensive 
and skilful style of draining, beautified much his estate by clumps 
and belts of plantations, and was, by the consequent increased pro- 
ductiveness of the soil, in the course of a few seasons, amply indem- 
nified for all his outlays. He was, moreover, the first agricultu- 
rist in this quarter who introduced the enclosing and irrigation of 
waste lands, by which, according to Alton, in his Agricultural View 
of the county of Ayr, " land not worth more than 3s. or 4s. an 
acre, produced to Mr Cochran upon 11 acres, 3000 stones, coun- 
ty weight, or 4500 stones English, of good hay." Another por- 
tion of his estate, consisting of 129 acres, he raised, by his mode 
of Improving it, from Is. 6d. per acre, to about L. 1 of yearly value. 
In all his undertakings he was eminently successful, and most 
strikingly illustrated how much might be accomplished within the 
compass of half an ordinary life, by art and industry, 

. " When science plans tbe progress of their toil." 

Since their introduction by Mr Cochran, agricultural improve- 
ments have been widely extended here, all of which received a 
fresh impulse, a few years ago, by the succession of the Earl of 
Glasgow to the estate of Kilbirnie, comprising three-fourths of 
the parish. Several of the largest arable farms on that exten- 
sive property, are in every species of improvement rapidly ad- 
vancing to the limits of perfection; while the hope may apparent- 
ly be safely indulged, that the period is not distant, when all the 
land in the parish, susceptible of profitable cultivation, will be in 
an equally improved condition. 

Mines and Qiiarries. — Coal has been wrought here upwards of 
a century. The first pit was on the west bank of Kilbirnie loch, 
but in 1808, the water breaking in, the workings in this quarter 
have ever since been abandoned. Shortly afterwards, a pit was 
opened in the southern extremity of the parish, which continues to 
furnish two kinds of coal, both of a good quality. The upper 
seam, which is of the description called splint coal, is three foet in 
thickness, and of an average depth of fifteen fathoms from the 



KILDIHNIE. 



715 



surface. Under this seam, at a depth of six fathoms, a very good 
slaty coal of about the same thickness as the upper seam, is like- 
wise wrought. Both coals are overlain by limestone, and the re- 
gularity of the beds is frequently intersected and dislocated by 
dikes and other disturbing causes, denominated " troubles." A 
sandstone quarry in the neighbourhood of the village has been less 
or more wrought, during the last forty years. The stone is of a 
fine cream colour, and, though a little coarse in the grain, it is very 
durable, and well adapted for every purpose of country masonry. 
Though this stone is to be had in large masses at the quarry, or 
in plates of large dimensions, it not unfrequently occurs in a shat- 
tered form, and in that case is almost useless for building. There 
are likewise two flagstone quarries open at present, for the produce 
of which there is a considerable demand ; and limestone, held in 
much repute, abounds in the west part of the parish. It is fur- 
nished at the kiln at the rat6 of 10s. 6d. per chalder of 16 bolls.

raised in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as fol- 
lows :

Manufactures. — About thirty-five years ago, a small cotton ma- 
nufactory was established here by Mr George Allan. The mill 
was burned down in 1831, and rebuilt by him on an enlarged scale ; 
but in 1834, he sold the building to Mr David Watson, Glasgow, 
who has fitted it up as a spinning power-loom manufactory. It is 
five stories in height with attics. The spinning-machinery, which 
consists of about 4000 self-acting mule-spindles, was fitted up bv 
Mr Smith of Deanston, on Smith and Orr's patent principle, and 
is allowed by judges to be equal, if not superior, to any in the 
kingdom. It is driven by two engines, one of 32, and the other 
of 12 horse power. The work employs in all 350 hands, who are 
paid about L.250 per fortnight of wages. The men earn from 
10s. to L. 1, 5s.; females from 5s. to Ss. ; and boys and girls from 
2s. 6d. to 5s. weekly. The average working time, according to 
the Act of Parliament, is sixty- nine hours weekly, or twelve hours 



ri6

per day for five day of the week, and nine hours for the remain- 
ing working day. 

wm" V,'' P'"""'"&amp; °f fl'- vvas erected by Messrs 

Wilson and Jam.esons, in the same locality as the power-loom 
manufactory, which has ever since been in full operation Th. 
machinery is driven by an engine of 16 horse power, and the work 
employs li,0 hands, who receive about L. 130 a fortnight in wacres 
The men are paid from ls. to L. 1, 18.s. ; females about 6s. ; "and 
boys and girls from 2s. 6d. to .3s. per week. The hours of work- 
ing at both establishments are the same. 

On the opposite bank of the river, and at a short distance west 
of the above manufactories, is an extensive bleachfield belono-in 
to Messrs William and James Knox. They commenced the\u- 
siness, at least on its present enlarged scale, in 1829, which thev 
have ever since conducted with great skill, spirit, and succes"' 
They are chiefly employed by the thread manufacturers of Beith 
and bleach, annually, about 140,000 lbs. of linen thread yarn, be- 
sides finishing about 1800 lbs. of coloured threads weekly. The 
number of hands in their employment has averaged, the last three 
years, from 90 to 100, who receive between L.70 and L.80 per 
fortnight in wages. The men are paid at the rate of from 12s. to 
L. ] ; females from .5s. to 7s. 6d. ; and a few boys and girls, 4s. 
weekly. The hands in this employment work ten hours a- day, 
or sixty hours per week, and, when working extra time, are paid 
proportionately. In addition to this extensive business, the Messrs 
Knox have recently erected in the vicinity of the bleachfield a 
mill for spinning flax, which, when in full operation, will employ 
between 60 and 70 hands. 

A rope-work, commenced a few years ago, deserves likewise 
to be noticed in this enumeration of the several branches of ma- 
nufacture lately introduced here. It employs, on an average, 20 
spinners, men and boys, the produce of whose labour, consistino- 
of band and common twines, finds in part a market on the spot, 
but the most of which is sent, we believe, to Paisley for disposal. 

All these works, besides affording a very fair remuneration and 
support to those engaged in them, have brought a great deal of 
money into circulation, increased considerably the value of pro- 
perty, and benefited not a little the farmer by the proximity of a 
market for much of his produce, as well as many of the shopkeepers 
and resident handicraftsmen. There is, however, one class of 
intelligent operatives, — the hand- loom weavers, of whom there are 



KILBIRNIE. 



717 



160 here, who have been long indifferently paid for their work, 
and many of whom are occasionally thrown out of employment al- 
together. They are engaged on the usual kinds of work furnished 
by the Glasgow and Paisley manufacturers, and may make when 
trade is ordinarily brisk, from lis. to 12s, per week, working at 
the rate of twelve hours per day. At present, many of them work 
from five in the morning to ten at night, and, with all their exertion, 
they will not earn above Is. 6d. or Is. 8d. a-day. It is highly cre- 
ditable to the spirit and principles of the great body of these me- 
chanics, that, amidst all their privations, they maintain a respectable 
appearance, and that even when stretching their efforts to the ut- 
most, in order to gain a scanty subsistence for their families, they 
should rarely, if ever, fail to bestow on their children the elements 
of an education, equal, at least in essentials, to that generally re- 
ceived by the off,-;pring of more affluent parents. 

There are likewise about 150 females employed by agents for 
Glasgow and Paisley houses, in sprigging or flowering muslin. 
This branch of industry is very well paid at present, as, without 
any outlay or much broken time, an expert and diligent sewer will 
earn from 7s. to 10s. a- week, though probably the average gains, 
one with another, throughout the year, do not exceed Is. per day. 
This employment furnishes the means of decent support to many 
respectable females, and is decidedly preferred by nearly all the 
young women, natives of Kilbirnie, to working in either of the 
manufactories. 

Ayricultiiral Association. — There is no public or private asso- 
ciation in this parish for the encouragement or improvement of any 
branch of industry ; but a few of the farmers are members of the 
Ardrossan Farmer's Society, and others of the General Ayrshire 
Agricultural Association, both of which have excited considerable 
interest in the improvement of the breeds of cattle, and of the art 
of ploughing. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Village. — The only village here is that of Kilbirnie. It is 
pleasantly situated on the banks of the Garnock, and nearly 
in the centre of the most populous and fertile part of the pa- 
rish. It consists principally of a long street lying south and 
north along the right bank of the river, and a shorter one extend- 
ing westwards from its upper extremity. Two of the public works 
are situated on the left of the Garnock, as are likewise a row or 
two of dwelling-houses, the greater part of which are only of a few 



718 



AYltSHIUK. 



years standing. As ttiany of the houses are of recent construc- 
tion, the village bears a cleanly and cheerful aspect, to which the 
light tint of the freestone used here in building, contributes mate- 
rially. The town is altogether, indeed, of comparatively modern 
existence, as it consisted, fifty years previous to 1792, the date of 
the last Statistical Account, of only three houses. At the latter 
period, it contained "about 80 families or 300 people." In 1819, 
the number of inhabitants is estimated by Robertson in his « To' 
pographical Description of Cunninghame" at 700, and in 1831, 
they were a little below 1000. As there have been two ex- 
tensive manufactories established in the village since that date, 
and not fewer than 21 two-storied houses erected, besides others 
enlarged and repaired, the population at the present day cannot 
be less than 1500 or 1600, having thus more than doubled itself 
within the last twenty years. 

The houses are, in general, lighted with gas, Kilbirnie being the 
smallest town in the west of Scotland thus accommodated. °The 
gas is procured at the usual rates, partly from the works at the 
power loom manufactory, and is partly furnished by Mr John Al- 
lan, a spirited individual, who, at his own expense, has erected a 
work capable of supplying one-half of the village with the purest 
quality of this brilliant and economical light. 

Beith, situated three miles and a-quarter fr om Kilbirnie, is its 
post-town, and as it contains branches of several banks, and is the 
seat of a monthly justice of peace court, much of the business of 
this parish is transacted there. Its market is, however, merelv 
nominal, but the disposable produce of this, and the surrounding 
parishes, finds a ready and ever-absorbing outlet, in the great trad- 
ing communities of Glasgow, Paisley, and Greenock. 

Means of Commimicatinn. — There is a penny post twice a day 
to Beith. The person who has the charge of the sub-office in 
Kilbirnie undertakes the delivery of all letters in the parish. The 
turnpike road from Dairy to Lochwinnoch, intersects the lower 
part of the parish, in the direction of north-east ; and another to 
Largs crosses its breadth to the west. There are likewise two 
turnpike roads leading eastwards, one of which runs by the north, 
and the other bv the south end of Kilbirnie loch — though there is 
no part of the former, and only about a mile of the latter, within 
this parish. These and two good parish roads leading into the 
interior, give ready access to all the arable land, and leave scarce- 
ly any additional accommodation, in this respect, to be desired. 



KILBIllNIF. 



719 



There are five and a-half miles of turnpike, and six and a-half miles 
of parish roads, all of which are kept in good repair. Two carriers 
travel once a-week to Glasgow, and on separate days the same 
number maintain the commercial intercourse with Paisley. There 
are likewise weekly opportunities of conveying parcels to Green- 
ock, though there is no regular carrier on this road, — and from 
Beith to Largs, there pass through Kilbirnie twice a week as 
many carriers. No stage-coach runs nearer to this than Beith, 
nor is chaise, gig, or car kept for hire in the village. 

Bridges. — There are not fewer than twelve bridges in the pa- 
rish, two of which are in the village and a third hard by it. Se- 
veral of these, however, span even in the worst of weather, insig- 
nificant streamlets, and are all, with the exception of that over the 
Garnuck in Kilbirnie, on a level with the roads they connect, and 
of sufficient breadth. The one alluded to, besides beino- unneces- 
sarily steep, is by much too narrow, there being only ten feet be- 
tween the parapets. It stood a long time with the ledges partly 
broken down, until on a dark stormy night in the winter of 1811, 
a native fell over it, and was carried off by the swollen river and 
drowned. On the turnpike south of the loch, though by much 
the best and most frequented of the two roads leading eastward, 
there is no bridge over the river, which is, in consequence, alto- 
gether impassable after heavy rains. Pedestrians can, however, 
cross it by means of a wooden bridge, though that this may some- 
times be attended with danger, was fiitally exemplified, four years 
ago, in the case of a benighted farmer, who, missing his footing, was 
precipitated into the overwhelming waters and perished. The 
want of a bridge over this ford has long been felt, — a desideratum 
that will probably now be soon supplied, as the railway passes within 
less than half a-mile of it, and it is said to be by this line of 
road that the communication between it and Kilbirnie is to be es- 
tablished. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church of Kilbirnie belonged an- 
ciently to the monastery of Kilwinning. The Monks enjoyed 
the rectorial tithes and revenues, and a vicarage was established 
for serving the cure. In the Books of Adjournal, commencing 
in 1507, mention is made of Robert Peblis, in Brockly, being con- 
victed of a felony done in the house of John Skeoch, capelano in 
Kilbirny. I'his is the first notice we have met with of a resident 
chaplain. In 1543, James Scott was vicar of Kilbirnie. Prior to 
that year, the Abbot of Kilwinning had granted to the Colleo-e of 



720 AYRSHIUE. 

Justice a yearly pension of L. 28 Scots, from the vicarage of Kil- 
birnie, but on the 15th of December, a mandate by the Abbot, 
ordering said sum to be taken from the vicarage of Dunlop, is ra- 
tified by ParHament. At the Reformation, the parsonage tithes 
of Kilbirnie were held on a lease from the Abbot and Monks of 
Kilwinning for the small sum of L. 8 Scots yearly. In 1567, Mr 
Archibald Hamilton was vicar and exhorter, with the tliryd of the 
vicarage, amounting to L. 31, '2s. 2d. He was forfeited in 1571, 
for joining with his clansmen, the Hamiltons, in defence of Queen 
Mary, and was succeeded by Robert Crawfurd , vicar and reader, 
■who had the haill vicarage. His successor was Mr John Harriot, 
who died prior to 1619, as in that year, Mr William Russell, mi- 
nister of Kilbirnie, appears as a debtor in the testament of Alex- 
ander Eoyd, one of the regents of Glasgow College. In 1670, 
Mr William TuUidaff was admitted under the first Indulgence, and 
in 1672, Mr Patrick Anderson was conjoined with him. Mr Tul- 
lidaft' did not conform to the wishes of the, Court, and was in con- 
sequence subjected to many hardships. On 8th July 1673, he 
was fined in the half of his stipend for not observing the 29th of 
MaYj the anniversary of Charles's restoration, and in 1684, he and 
others of ti e indulged ministers were imprisoned. At the Revo- 
Xw.'.on in 1688, Mr John Glasgow was admitted and remained in 
the charge until his death in 1721, when he was succeeded by Mr 
James t'mith, who died 11th February 1733. f To Mr Smith 

" On the 15th June 1647, Mr Russell complained to the Presbytery, that John 
Braidine, one of his parishioners,Jiad called his doctrine " dust and grey meal." The 
said John Braidine being summoned before the Presbytery for the offence, " com- 
peared 29lh June, and ingenuously confessed his fault. The Presbytery, considering 
how prt-judicial such speeches were to the whole rainistrie, after mature deliberation, 
does ordain, that first upon his knees he make ane confession of his fault before the 
Presbytrie, and yrafter to goe to his owne congregation, and there in the public place 
of repentance make ane acknowledgement of his fault likewise ; and Mr Hugh 
M'Kaile to goe to Kilbirnie to receive him."— He submitted, and was absolved. 

f On his tombstone in Kilbirnie churchyard, is the following epitaph, said to have 
been composed by Patrick, second Viscount Garnock, and which, as it will soon be 
illegible, is considered worthy of being preserved here.

succeeded Mr Malcolm Brown, who was admitted, 30th January 
1734, and was in office until his death in 1794. He lived to the 
age of 100 years, and was, as is stated on his monument, " a man 
highly respected, esteemed and regretted." On the 6th of August 
1795, the present incumbent was admitted. 

The parish church is situated about half a mile south of the vil- 
lage, and may be considered as thus far removed now from the 
central point of the population. Its position is not, however, 
the subject of any complaint, as there is only one farm-house 
so far distant as three miles from it. It is the most ancient, 
and, in some respects, the most interesting ecclesiastical fabric ex- 
tant in the west of Scotland. The body of the edifice, a simple 
oblong, 65 feet in length and 29 feet and a-half in breadth, must 
have been built considerably prior to the Reformation, for the 
Glengarnock aisle attached to its south-east extremity, is evi- 
dently a modern addition, though bearing the date 1597. The 
Craufurd gallery, extending in a direction opposite to this aisle, is 
the most recently constructed part of the edifice, having been built 
in 1664, by Sir John Craufurd, as is recorded in relieved characters 
over one of its windows. The church is, however, chiefly remarkable 
on account of the carvings in oak with which this gallery and the 
pulpit are profusely decorated, and for the numerous emblazoned 
proofs on the former, of the ancestral gentility of John, first Vis- 
count Garnock, by whose commands all these adornments were 
executed in the early part of the last century. Along the front of 
this stately family-seat, there are no fewer than sixteen armorial 
escutcheons genealogically arranged, besides two elaborate repre- 
sentations of the Viscount's honours. This heraldic display, with 
the carved decorations and some ancient monumental remains, 
both within and without the church, render it an object unique in 
its kind, and one of no common interest to the curious in matters 
of heraldry and antiquity. As this venerable fabric will, in a short 
time, be inadequate to accommodate the rapidly increasing popu-

lation, it is to be hoped that, instead of being supplanted, it will 
be found capable, when required, of receiving a satisfactory en- 
largement. Altogether, it is at present capable of easily accom- 
modating 500 sitters. The whole of the seats, with the exception 
of five table ones and thirty-two free sittings, belong to the heri- 
tors. The table seats, which accommodate 55 sitters, having been 
ferected or repaired by money borrowed from the poor's fund, are 
annually let for their benefit. 

The following are the only benefactions ever made to the poor 
of this parish. Though neither of great amount nor very interest- 
ing, they certainly merit being recorded — a justice which has not 
vet been awarded them, at' least in the usual manner that similar 
bequests are elsewhere acknowledged. In 1794, the Rev. Malcolm 
Brown bequeathed L. 10 ; in 1813, James Orrj farmer in Cock- 
ston, L. 20, the interest annually to be given to the poor; in 1823, 
William Kirkwood, a native of this parish, and late farmer in 
Knockside of Largs, L. 20; in 1829, the late James Gavin, re- 
siding in Glasgow, L. 50 ; in 1831, John Kirkwood, a native of 
this parish, and late farmer in Baidland-hill of Dairy, L. 5 ; in 
1834, Andrew Wilson, a native of this parish, and late merchant 
in Paisley, L. 5. 

The manse is pleasantly situated about a quarter of a jmile south- 
east of the church, and within a few yards of the water of Gar- 
nock. It is sufficiently commodious and substantial, having, along 
with the offices, been built in 1796. The glebe, consisting of 
eight acres and three roods of excellent land, lies conveniently 
around it, the yearly value of which is about L. 24. The stipend 
is eighty-four bolls, one firlot of oatmeal, and L. 127, 4s. 8|d. ; 
communion elements included. The Earl of EgHnton is patron. 

There is a neat and commodious chapel in the village belonging 
to the Reformed Presbytery, of which the Rev. James Ferguson 
is minister. It was built in 1824, and has accommodation for 480 
sitters, but, as many of the members of this congregation belong 
to the adjoining parishes, the usual attendance does not probably 

• The words of Mr Gavin's deed of settlement relative to this bequest are as 
follows •— " To the parish of Kilbirnie, Ayrshire, fifty pounds after the heritable 
properly is disposed of, the interest of which to be paid for the education of honest 
poor people's children, each child to be allowed two years' education, and the ma- 
nagement to be always under the direction of the kirk-session ; and which session is 
to dispose of the original sum here bequeathed, in such a way that it may yield tlie 
higiiest interest, always secure that it may not be lost, and at the same time may 
never be alienated from the object already specified, namely, the education ot as many 
honest poor people's children as can be accomplished by the yearly interest ot tuo 
same."

exceed 240. The minister is paid from the seat-rents and from 
collections — the amount of the stipend being L. 80 ; besides which, 
he has a comfortable dwelling-house and a good garden. 

The number of families belonging to the Establishment may be 
stated at 231 ; communicants, 300; families belonging to the Re- 
formed Presbytery, 60 ; communicants, 130. The church and 
chapel are in general well attended. Of the floating population or 
incomers connected with the factories, there are a few families of 
Roman Catholics, and several others of no visible religious profes- 
sion whatsoever. 

Education. — The parish school, at which there is an average 
attendance of 60 pupils, is situated in the village. Here are 
taught, besides the ordinary branches of education, practical ma- 
thematics, book-keeping, Latin, and Greek. The fees are per 
annum — English, 10s.; English, with writing, 12s.; these with 
arithmetic, 14s. ; and for Latin and Greek, 20s. Besides his fees, 
which may average L.30, the teacher has more than the legal ac- 
commodation, but the salary is the minimum, being L. 25, 15s. 4d. 
There are. in the village likewise, three private or unendowed 
schools, at which the total average number of scholars is about 70; 
but at all of which, the branches of learning taught are confined to 
English, writing, and arithmetic. Nor in this enumeration of the 
sources of instruction, should a Sunday-school, under the super- 
intendence of the Rev. James Ferguson, be unmentioned. It is 
well attended, and has been the means of disseminating much re- 
ligious knowledge among the youth of both sexes. 

None of the young between six and fifteen years of age, who 
have been brought up in this parish, are unable to read, and it is 
believed that, with the exception of a few females, there is not a 
native above the age of fifteen, who cannot write, or who is ignorant 
of the first rules of arithmetic. These facts require no com- 
ment; at least, they illustrate satisfactorily, that the people here 
are fully alive to the benefits of education, and that the present 
race of parents have little to reproach themselves with, in this re- 
spect, in not fulfilling their duties. 

Libraries. — A subscription library, established here in 1820, 
consists now of upwards of 500 volumes. The books have been 
judiciously chosen, and are chiefly historical works, voyages and 
travels. The entry and annual subscription money are each 2s. 6d. 
There is likewise a small select congregational library connected 
with the Reformed Presbytery, composed of moral and religious 



724 



AYRSHIRE. 



works. It is supported by the heads of families, and the books 
are lent gratis to the young people attending the Sunday-school. 

Friendly Societies. — A society termed " The Kilbirnie Gar- 
dener's Society," having for its object reciprocal support during 
sickness, was instituted three years ago. It consists at present of 
100 members, and the stock amounts fo upwards of L. 100. The 
entry payment is 3s. 6d., and the annual assessment is 6s., paid 
by regular quarterly instalments. A member must have joined 
the Society five years, before being entitled to any benefit from the 
funds ; but after this period, he receives 6s. per week, if bedrid ; 
4s., if unable to work, but not confined ; and in the event of 
death, L. 1 is allowed in defrayment of funeral charges. As this 
Society is based on principles of acknowledged stability, it is to be 
hoped it may soon be generally supported. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of regular 
paupers on the poor's fund, for the last five years, has been 13. 
During that time, 36 individuals have annually received oc- 
casional assistance. The regular poor receive from 5s. to 12s. per 
month. The average allowance to each person annually, is L. 2, 
12s. The sum expended yearly in occasional assistance, is L.33, 
6s. 3|d ; regular poor, L. 34, 10s. 6d. The sources of supply are, 
the funds derived from collections at the church door, averaging 
L. 22; interest of money, 16s.; rents of church seats, L. 3, 3s.; 
proclamation of banns and mortcloth dues, L. 5. The deficiency 
has hitherto been made up by a voluntary assessment of the heri- 
tors on the valued rent, but henceforth the real rent is to be as- 
sessed for this purpose. In the former Statistical Account, it is 
said, " there are few poor, and none that go a-begging; the poor's 
funds are good, and more than sufficient for the parish poor ;" — a 
statement totally inapplicable, with the exception of public beg- 
ging, to the condition of the poor at the present day. The paro- 
chial funds, which, at that period, had accumulated to upwards of 
1j. 300, have been long since exhausted, while the contributions 
of the charitable and voluntary assessments have, of late years, 
proved barely sufficient to meet the wants of the regular poor, and 
the still more numerous claimants for occasional assistance. 
Pauperism has not, however, kept more than a corresponding pace 
with the population since 1792, or if it has, it would not be diffi- 
cult to assign its increase to other causes than to any decay of the 
virtuous feelings of decent pride among those liable by many ca- 
sualties, exclusive of sickness and old age, to impoverishment. 



KILBIRNIE.

While compulsory assessments are deprecated as fraught with ma- 
nifold and permanent injuries to the poor and the parishes at large 
on which they are imposed, it is strange that, notwithstanding this 
belief, voluntary charity will not exert itself to avert the dreaded 
evil — thereby showing, that to " feed the hungry, and to clothe 
the naked," is, we are afraid, regarded by many, even in this phi- 
lanthropic age, more in the light of a hateful imposition, than in 
that of a sacred duty. But after all that has been said against 
this mode of provision, since there must be a tax for such a pur- 
pose, " I know of none," says an eminent authority, " less subver- 
sive of industry and morals, than that established in Scotland, 
obliging the landholders," and we would add the house proprie- 
tors, " in every parish, to meet at stated times, in order to pro- 
vide a fund for the poor ; but leaving the objects of their charity, 
and the measure, to their own humanity and discretion." 

Fairs. — The principal fair in this place is held on the third 
"Wednesday of May, old style, and is attended by a great concourse 
of people, being the largest horse-market in the west of Scotland. 
It is vulgarly called Brinnan"s daj', which is evidently a corruption 
of Brandane's day. The number of horses exhibited for sale at 
this fair, has averaged annually, these nine or ten years past, above 
700, the aggregate value of which may be estimated between 
L. 8000 and L. 9000. Brinnan's day has likewise been long 
celebrated for the sale of cooper-work and culinary utensils, such 
as platters, basins, ladles, &amp;c. and spinning-wheels and reels. A 
considerable deal of these articles are still sold, though the de- 
mand for turned work for domestic uses is much lessened from what 
it was half a century ago, and the wheel and the reel have been 
all but superseded. Much general business is transacted among 
the country people at this fair : — rents paid, tradesmen's accounts 
settled, new articles bespoken ; and until lately, that shops have 
everywhere been established, many household wants were in a great 
measure supplied for the year. 

There used to be other two fairs held in Kilbirnie, the trades- 
race, on the first Tuesday of July, and Crawfurd's day, on the last 
Tuesday of October, both old styles. The former has gone down, 
in despite of the efforts of a few interested publicans to uphold 
it ; and the other, which was a cow-fair, instituted, it is said, by the 
Crawfurds of Kilbirnie, has long since ceased to be a cattle- market, 
or even to be observed as a holiday.

jjins. — There are four inns, where travellers may be comforta- 
bly enough accommodated, and eleven ale or wliisky-houses, in 
the village, and another at a toll-bar, within a quarter of a mile 
of it. The latter class of houses might assuredly, for any benefi- 
cial purposes they serve to promote, be dispensed with altogether. 
They are in a great measure supported by the hard-working arti- 
san and labourer, all of whose expenditure in such haunts of 
thoughtlessness and dissipation, cannot otherwise be regarded than 
as so much deducted from individual or family comforts. In jus- 
tice, however, to the character of at least the native population, 
it may be stated that neither hard-drinking nor sottish tippling, 
prevails to so great a proportionate extent in Kilbirnie, as in many 
of the neighbouring towns. 

Fuel. — There is, as has been already stated, a coal-pit in the 
southern extremity of the parish, about a mile and a quarter from 
the village. Besides the common kind of coal, it furnishes an- 
other called splint, much in demand for the making of gas, and 
when the two are used together, they make a quick and cheerful 
fire. The former costs at the pit 7d., and the other Is. per load ; 
seven and a half of which make an ordinary cart, and ten loads a 
ton. A considerable quantity of the coals used here are, however, 
brought from the parishes of Beith and Dairy, and cost respectively 
on being laid down in the village, 7s. 4d. and 7s. lOd. per ton. 
Peats are procured from the high grounds, but are only used in 
kindling fires, and cost, including driving, 3s. a cart. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The principal agricultural improvements introduced into the 
parish within the last forty years may be thus enumerated: — bet- 
ter parish and turnpike roads, — superior accommodation in farm- 
buildings, — an improved system of husbandry, based on an exten- 
sive and skilful style of draining, — and, as a consequence of this, 
a greater breadth of land under tillage, and much heavier crops 
raised. To these it may be added, that waste lands have, to some 
extent, been enclosed and irrigated, and others planted ; that 
greater facilities are now afforded for the thrashing and disposing 
of grain and of the produce of the dairy ; and that the breeds of 
live-stock have been all of late years much improved. These con- 
stitute the most striking variations betwixt the present state of the 
parish, and that which existed at the time of the last Statistical 
Account. 

The great increase of the village since 1792, as well as the 



STEWARTON. 



727 



causes of its prosperity, has been already adverted to. The nu- 
merous advantages of the locahty will, probably, from time to time, 
induce the establishment of other manufactories ; and it is not by 
any means unlikely, that the progress of Kilbirnie in wealth, popu- 
lation, and extent, in the lapse of twenty years, may exceed con- 
siderably all the late advances, striking as these have been. In 
addition to what may be accomplished on the banks of the Gar- 
nock, should the projected iron works in the south-east quarter of 
the parish succeed, another source of prosperity will be opened, 
which no one, a few years ago, could have possibly anticipated, — 
while the railway from Glasgow to Ayr will confer many commer- 
cial advantages on this, and on all the districts it traverses.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. CHARLES BANNATYNE STEVEN, MINISTER. 



L_T0P0GKAPHY AND NaTURAL HiSTORY. 

Name and Boundaries —Tu name is evidently formed from 
the surname Stewart, first used as a family distinction by Walter 
II. in 1204. The district of Cuninghame, with others in the 
county, being the property of the Crown, was from time to time 
vested in the hands of some powerful family, and Stewarton, among 
others, being created into a separate lordship, became the inheri- 
tance of James, High Steward, in 1283. In the account of the 
charters granted by Robert I., II., and III., there is one by Ro- 
bert III. to John Stewart Earl of Buchan, the Regent's son, and 
Elizabeth de Douglas, his spouse, daughter to Archibald Earl of 
Douglas, of the lands of Stewarton, and Armsheugh, and Dunlop, 
in Cuninghame, on the resignation of the Earl of Douglas. 

This parish is situated in the district of Cuninghame, and is 
bounded by the parishes of Neilston and Mearns in Renfrew- 
shire on the north-east ; Fenwick, on the east and south-east ;

AYRSHIRE. 



Dreghorn, on the south ; Irvine and Kilwinning, on the west ; and 
Dunlop, on tlie north-west and north. Its greatest length is 
nearly ten miles from east to west ; its breadth from south to north 
varies from four to three miles : it contains about twenty square 
miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — The surface of the parisli is beau- 
tifully diversified with fine sloping grounds and gentle eminences, 
and gradually rises from south-west to north-east, till it ends in 
the boundary line with Renfrewshire, where the lands are of some 
height, and diversified with hills; from several of which, many ex- 
tensive views gratify the admirer of the wonders and beauties of 
nature. The eye comprehends, in one sweep of the horizon, Ben- 
lomond, on the north ; Jura, Arran, Ailsa, and faintly in the dis- 
tance Ireland, on the west; the Mull of Galloway, the boundary 
hills of Kirkcudbright, and Dumfries-shire, on the south. North- 
east winds prevail in the west of Scotland 104 days, north-west 
40, south-east 47, and south-west 174. Westerly winds prevail 
during July and August, north-east during January, March, May, 
and June, north-west from November till March, the north-east 
less frequent during February, July, September, and December, 
and the north-west during September and October, than in other 
months. 

Hydrography. — The parish possesses one mineral spring of little 
celebrity as yet, called Bloak Well, first discovered, nearly thirty 
years ago, by pigeons resorting to it from the neighbouring parishes. 
A neat and handsome house is built over it by the proprietor, Mr 
Cuninghame of Lainshaw. This was done in 1833, when heap- 
pointed a keeper to take care of it. 

The parish is watered throughout its whole extent by streams 
of considerable size, the Annock, the Swinsey, and the Corsehill 
and East Burns, and the Glazart. The whole of these streams, 
with the exception of the Glazart, unite with the Annock at the 
town of Stewarton. The Glazart joins the Annock at Water- 
meetings, four miles below. I'he Annock flows from the White 
Loch, in Mearns parish, six miles east of Stewarton. Some of 
them run in not very deep channels. 

Geology. — Whinstone is the mineral chiefly met with, and is 
found mostly above the town, and towards Renfrewshire on the 
north and east. Freestone adapted to building is abundant. Lime- 
stone abounds on the east of the town, and lies near the sm-fjice,

which is level and easily wrought. It is raised and burned in com- 
mon draw-kilns on the estate of Lochridge, and on the lands of 
Cutstraw, Corsehills, Clerkland, and Lintbrae. Coal is found in 
very thin strata, and is used on the spot for burning limestone. 
Seams of coal have not yet been found so thick as to be wrought 
by itself, though attempts for that purpose have been made very 
lately, by three proprietors, which have been attended with con- 
siderable expense to one of the contractors, and disappointment to 
the public. Peat for fuel is found in great abundance at each 
end of the parish. 

fVood. — Though our forests have disappeared, the present nu- 
merous residing proprietors are endeavouring to restore them in 
the form of plantations, particularly in the lower part of the parish. 
Firs of every sort and forest timber have been planted, which ap- 
pear to be most congenial to the soil and climate, and thereby the 
lands have a cheerful, sheltered, and improved aspect. There is 
one fine arbor-vitse, a fig-tree, and a cedar of Lebanon in the gar- 
den of Lainshaw, each of long standing. 

II. — Civil Htstory. 
Eminent Characters. — David Dale was the son of a gro- 
cer, and born, in January 1739, in a two storey thatched-house 
at the Cross of Stewarton, which still remains in much the 
same state as when occupied by his father; he was educated 
only in the then common elementary branches. After learning 
weaving in Paisley, he left it for Hamilton, and afterwards remov- 
ed to Glasgow, where he carried on business in the linen yarn 
trade for many years. He afterwards, with others, erected mills 
for spinning cotton at Lanark and Catrine. The directors of the 
Royal Bank employed him as their agent in Glasgow, of which city 
he was one of the magistrates, and where at the same time he offi-. 
ciated as a preacher of an Independent Church. His charity was 
extensive, and there are individuals living here who still partake of 
his bounty, though he died in March 1806, leaving it is said, 
L. 100,000 and upwards. Mr Owen, the founder of Socialism, 
is his son-in-law, propagating doctrines which would have vexed 
the heart of his upright good old father-in-law. 

John Blackwood, late kirk-officer, and another upright in- 
dividual, deserves notice, as he at the same time was agent for 
the Union Bank of Paisley for several years at the end of last 
century. His character was so well established for accuracy and 
integrity, that no security was required of him by the bank ; this

was at the recommendation of his relation and friend, Mr Dale, 
referred to above. John Blackwood died in 1830, the anniversary 
of the ninetieth year of his age. 

The next individual entitled to particular remark, is Dr Ro- 
bert Watt, compiler of the " Bibliotheca Britannica," a work, in 
the opinion of Dr Dibdin, " the most extraordinary of the kind 
in the literature of Europe." His life is given in Chambers's 
Scottish Biographical Dictionary, and what follows may be looked 
on only as a supplement to it. He was born on 1st May 1774. 
The name of the farm in the parish record is Bonnyton, not Muir- 
head, now Girgenti, so named by its present proprietor, John 
Cheape, representative of the Cheapes of Sauchie, Stirlingshire. 
The account of him inserted in the " Life" above alluded to, closes 
when his studies in the Latin and Greek languages commenced 
with the writer of this account in October or November 1792 ; 
and he was then about eighteen years old. It was only one hour's 
private attendance in the morning that he could spare, as he had 
his occupation of carpenter to attend to, through the rest of the 
day. Notwithstanding, such progress did he make in both lan- 
guages, that he entered the Latin and Greek classes of Glasgow 
University in 1793, and obtained a prize in the Greek class from 
Professor Young. In 1794, he attended the Greek and Logic 
classes also at Glasgow; and in 1795-96, the Moral and Natural 
philosophy classes at Edinburgh. During the summer 1796, he 
taught a private school in Kilmaurs parish, when he became an ad- 
mirer of the late Rev. Mr John Russell of Kilmarnock, the " Rum- 
ble John" of Burns. He then resolved to study divinity, and, in 
order to have two strings to his bow, also anatomy at Edinburgh, 
which he did in 1796-97. An essay on Regeneration was pre- 
scribed, for which L. 10 were to be given, and which he obtained. 
Professor Hunter, on delivery of the prize, was pleased to re- 
mark, " that it was not only the best essay, but the first time, under 
him, that a student of the first year's standing, attempted and suc- 
ceeded so well and so deservedly." In 1797-98, he spent one year 
in Symington as parochial schoolmaster, and merely enrolled his 
name as a student of divinity in Edinburgh, when an essay on Prayer 
was announced by Professor Hunter, for which a prize of L.8 was 
to be given, and which he also obtained. During his residence 
at Symington, the Rev. Mr Logan, minister of the parish, induced 
him, for reasons unnecessary to state here, to give up the study of 
divinity, and finish his medical studies, which he did in Glasgow in 



STEWARTON. 

1798-99. I have thought proper to be thus particular in the 
detail of the studies of one who was an honour and ornament to his 
country, and cut off" early in life; he died in 1819. He was dis- 
tantly related to the two persons noticed above. 

The writer may be allowed to mention another native of the 
parish, William Deans, late writer here, whose public spirit was 
such, that he in part accomplished, within the last thirty years, 
what Mr Dale originally intended on the banks of his native 
Annock, before he carried his cotton-spinning to the Clyde. The 
agent of the superior here, when consulted on the subject, dis- 
suaded the proprietor, on the ground not only of increasing the 
population, but, above all, pauperism, by the erection of public 
works. The wool and worsted mills at Robertland were erected 
by him and others. He was the originator, and for some time, a 
partner of the largest carpet-work in this place. The suburb 
originally called Templehouse, and now commonly called Darling- 
ton, was feued out by him. He was remarkable for his liberality, 
hospitality, and intelligence. At times he would amuse himself, 
after the dry labours of his profession, with composing essays on 
general subjects, and verses, not a few of which did him the highest 
honour. It is in the knowledge of the writer, who was the channel 
of communication, that for a manuscript collection of poems, he was 
offered in 1810 a price by the late Mr Constable, who would have 
taken chance of the sale of the volume. The subjoined verses 

• " At the dread hour of night, 
By the dim taper's light, 
Where death's pangs were smarting, 
And fond hearts were parting, 
I have sat by the nearest, 
And wept with the dearest. 
I have heard the last prayer 
Of the lovely and young ; 
But few friends were there ; 
And their fond hearts were wrung. 
The wife of my bosom, 
A sweet lovely blossom ; 
She lay panting for breath 
In the cold sweat of death. 
Now she's slept her last sleep ; 
She has gone — she has gone,— 
She hath left me to weep- 
All alone — all alone. 
And now gone are the joys 
Of our lonely retrtat ; 
For still mute is her voice, 
And still empty her scat ; 
On her motherless child 
Fast asleep on my knee, 
I gaze," &amp;c.

were written on the loss of his first wife : He died in the forty- 
ninth year of his age, 31st July 1828. 

Among the eminent natives of the parish may be properly includ- 
ed, James Gillies, Esq. M. D. long a successful medical practition- 
er m Bath, and one of his Majesty's physicians for Scotland. He 
died in 1826-7: also the Rev. John Brown of Clerkhill, preacher, 
author of Sermons and Prayers, posthumous works in two volumes, 
not pnnted for publication, besides numerous manuscripts on theo- 
logical and literary subjects ;-he died in 1833, aged thirty-nine 
years. John Gilmour, son of James Gilmour of Clerkland, who 
died in 1828, at the age of eighteen, was the author of a volume 
of" Poetical Remains,' printed after his death.f 

The people of this parish generally are intelligent, generous, 
hospitable, and, upon the whole, of a religious character. 

Landowners— The number of landowners, mostly resident, is 
eighty-three. They are as follows. Those properties Marked thus  
have been retained by the same families without entail, and with 
one exception, Corsehill to the same extent, since the year 1636 
at least.

Parochial Registers. — The registers of baptism and marriages 
have been preserved since 1693, though the first were not re- 
gularly kept till 1747, nor the second till 1794. The burials 
have been regularly recorded since May 1745. There is no dis- 
tinction of the sexes of children under twelve years. The minutes 
of session from 1757 to 1776, and from 1810 to the present time, 
are in good preservation. The minutes of heritors have been regu- 
larly kept since February 1774. Very few of the Dissenters re- 
gister; and great are the inconveniences often felt from this omis- 
sion. 

Historical Aoifzces.— Godfridus de Ross, Miles, son and heir 
of Sir Godfrede de Ross, Knight, confirms the land in Stewarton, 
which the abbacy of Pasley got from Sir James Ross in 1281. 
The representative of the family of Ross, now the Earl of Glas- 
gow, has, inter alia, the title of Lord Boyle of Stewarton, and at 
this date, January 1842, has now only about twelve acres in the 
parish, formerly called Crivochmill, but now commonly called 
Scrogmill, where was, till lately, a meal-mill, now converted to a 
wool-spinning-mill. 

The ruins, nearly levelled by the hand of time, of the Castle of 
Robertland, formerly the stronghold of the Cuninghames, Baronets 
of Robertland, are situated behind the modern mansion of Alexan- 
der Kerr, Esq. of Robertland. This stronghold, it is said, was de- 
stroyed by fire, in a feud between the Montgomeries of Eglinton 
and the Cuninghames; in revenge for which, one of the Cuning- 
hames shot the chief of the Eglintons, while riding home, near to 
Bridgend, at the east end of the town of Stewarton, where a path 
is still shown, called the " Weeping Path," along which he rode,

until he came to the ford of the Aiinock, at Bridgend, where he 
fell dead off his horse. This took place on the 12th April 1586, 
in the person of Hugh, fourth Earl of Eglinton. 

Antiquities.— The only antiquities worth mentioning, are the 
remains of two castles, once the seats of the Cuninghames of 
Corsehill and Aucbenharvie, branches of "the Cuninghames, 
Lords of Kilraaurs, by for the most powerful family in the dis- 
trict. The first-named has been lately celebrated by Gabriel 
Alexander, Esq. Advocate, the author of " My Grandfather's 
Farm," who is a native of this parish, and now resides in London. 
The critics of the day were pleased to ascribe the poem to Miss 
Mitford. About thirty years ago, while Mr Deans of Peacock- 
bank was rooting out some trees in a small plantation, on Carnduff 
Brae, on his property, he discovered three urns containing human 
bones. The urns were covered with a great quantity of stones, 
forming, it is conjectured, one of those cairns, in which the an- 
cient inhabitants of this country buried their dead. 

Modern Buildings. — The most worthy of notice are those of 
Mr Cuninghame of Lainshaw, Mr Kerr of Robertland, Col. S. 
M'Alister of Kennox, and Captain Cheape of Girgenti. This last 
is built iu rather an uncommon style. 

III. — Population. 

No documents exist here by which to form any estimate of the population, before

There is now only one village, and it is called Bloak, where 
there are about twelve families. Hard by, is the Mineral Well 
before noticed. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture and Rural Economy. — Owing to the humidity of the 
climate, and the little sunshine in summer, little wheat is raised 
in the parish, except by Mr Cuninghame of Lainshaw, who culti- 
vates it to a considerable extent. Green cropping is carried on to 
some extent, especially iu potatoes. The culture of turnip, which

is found to be of great advantage for the dairy stock, is increasing 
yearly. A great part of the lands, especially in the upper part of 
the parish, being loose and friable, is well suited for raising green 
crops, particularly potatoes for seed. There are few parishes in 
Scotland better adapted for dairy husbandry than this. Draining 
has been, for several years past, very common, and is now become 
general. Generally two-thirds or three-fourths of the farms are 
kept in grass, and the remainder cropped with two or three white 
crops, mostly oats, and laid down in grass, which is cut for rye- 
grass-hay, the year following the grain crop, and then allowed to 
remain in grass for five or eight years. The soil is so good, that, 
if allowed to lie in grass for any length of time, it becomes richer, 
or " in better heart," as the farmers term it, and does not grow 
wild, like poor soils. Were the land better cleaned, and sown 
down with good grass, it would graze more cattle, and materially 
benefit the dairy. There is a considerable want of shelter in the 
upper part of the parish, which, if judiciously planted in belts and 
clumps, would benefit the soil considerably, and increase its pro- 
ductiveness. The ftxrois have been suitably subdivided and well en- 
closed since the beginning of this century. The quantity of land 
under cultivation and otherwise is understood to be nearly as 
follows : — 

In tillage, about - - 2000 Scotch acres. 

Cultivated grass lauds, - - 5500 

Natural pasture, - - '000 

Moss land, - - - 1500 

Woods, gardens, and roads, • - 150 

Rent ofLand,—ArBb\e land rents from L. 1 to L. 3, lOs. per 
acre ; average L. 2. The rent of grazing a milch cow is about 
L. 4, 10s., or L. 5. In many instances, one Scotch acre grazes 
one cow. Glenouther or Hairshaw moor, extending to 600 acres, 
is now in common between two heritors. 600 or more acres of the 
same kind lie contiguous in the parishes of Mearns and Fenwick, 
where sportsmen from neighbouring quarters congregate on the 
12th of August. From its elevated situation, it might be greatly 
improved by draining, and were it properly sheltered, it would be 
good moor pasture, and in some instances might be profitably 
cropped. Higher lands in the neighbouring parish of Mearns yield 
good pasture, and are also often cropped. 

Enclosing with stone and lime costs L. 1, lOs. per rood. Few 
dry-stone fences are used here. Hedge fences are very com-

A good milch cow's price, L. 10, L. 12, L. 15, up to L. 20. A

L. 25, L. 30, L. 35. 

Breed and Qiiantitij of Live-Stock. — Milch cows of the Ayr- 
shire breed form the chief class of the cattle. The account of 
the stock, as described below, was taken several years ago. The 
stock of milch cows and sheep have greatly increased since, owing 
to the ready sale and comparatively high prices obtained for dairy 
produce.

Husbandry. — The lands being in the natural possession of con- 
siderably more than the majority of the heritors, the farm-buildings 
and enclosures, as already stated, are good. Leases vary as to 
endupance, according to the |leasure of the parties. 

Improvements. — By far the best system of cultivation practised 
here, was introduced and is still carried on by Mr Cuninghame of 
Lainshaw, the largest heritor, whose property extends to 2600 
acres and upwards. He retains in his own hands nearly 300 acres 
under the best management, equal to the best cultivated spots in 
England. This gentleman is well known as a writer on the sub- 
ject of our Saviour's personal Reign, Sacred Chronology, &amp;c. 

Manufactures. — There are about 300 weavers employed in 
cotton and silk fabrics, and not a few in customary work, such as 
shirtings, sheetings, tablecloths, towelling, blankets, druggets, &amp;c. 
&amp;c. The manufacture most famed is that of bonnets, and it is of 
a very long standing. Almost the whole regimental and naval 
bonnets and caps are made here, as well as those worn by 
the people in the country at large. Upwards of fifty families, 
besides a very great number of boys and girls, are thus em- 
ployed. Their deacon was styled, " Princeps Pileorum Arti 
fex Scotiae." Steel clockwork is peculiar to this place, and is in 
great demand, not only in Britain but in America. There is a

large manufacture of spindles for cotton and woollen mills. There 
have been introduced mills for carding- wool and tow, and also for 
wanking or fulling of bonnets, besides machinery for spinning wool 
and worsted. It is supposed that these works and the carpet-works, 
of which there are only two at present, might be still further ex- 
tended. The most of the trades' people here have gardens at- 
tached to their houses, in which they cultivate vegetables, fruits, 
and flowers ; which circumstance lately gave rise to a Horticultural 
and Florists' Society. They generally rent small pieces of ground 
for the purpose of growing as many potatoes as serve their families 
during the year. These habits are very conducive to health, and 
yield both recreation and profit. A tile and brick-work was erect- 
ed in the spring of 1839 by Mr Deans, on his property of Peacock- 
bank, which affords employment to a number of people, and con- 
siderable facility to the farmers in the neighbourhood, in draining 
and improving their farms. It is in the centre of the parish, and the 
quantity of tiles made in one year is supposed to exceed 500,000. 

v.— Parochial Economy. 
7 own, and Means of Communication. — The town of Stewarton 
is situate in the centre of the parish, on the banks of the Annock, 
about six miles north from Kilmarnock, and eight north-east from 
Irvine. About 150 years ago, it consisted of a few houses near the 
church, which gradually extended to the cross ; and now it is 
three-quarters of a mile in length, with several streets intersecting 
one another. There are not a few handsome buildings, and a 
town-house. The land around is fertile. Tradesmen and labour- 
ers of almost every description get employment, and abundance of 
every kind of provisions is supplied. The roads are kept in the 
best possible order. Caravans go daily to Kilmarnock; twice-a- 
week to Paisley, distant fifteen miles ; also twice-a-week to Glas- 
gow, distant eighteen miles. The weekly market is held on 
Thursday, but now little attended. The post from Kilmarnock 
arrives in the morning, daily, and returns in the evening. There 
are stated fairs. A .Justice of Peace Court is held here once a 
month. A Baron-bailie is appointed by the superior; he has of- 
ficials under him; and there is a jail to confine delinquents. As 
yet there is no police. Gas was introduced in 1832, at an expense 
of about L. 1200. A printing-press for bills, &amp;c. has been in 
operation since 1835. 

Ecclesiastical State. — For the convenience of the whole parish, 
the parish church could not be better situate. It was widened on the

north side in 18'25, and now accommodates 1800 sitters, including 
two aisles belonging to Mr Cuninghame of Lainshaw, the patron, 
and Sir A. D. M. Cuninghame of Corsehill, Bart., which contain 
nearly 300 sitters. It is any thing but neat and comfortable, though 
kept in repair, and well lighted with gas. The glebe consists of 
four acres Scotch, and is worth about L.12 a-year. The stipend 
was augmented in 1835, and is eighteen chalders, half-meal, half- 
barley, with L.15 for communion elements. Average amount for 
the last five years, L. 280. The unexhausted teinds amount to 
L. 291 at least, as stated in the third report of the Commission- 
ers for Religious Instruction. The congregation here of the As- 
sociate Synod of original Seceders lately united itself with the 
Church of Scotland, and has since built a new church containing 
accommodation for 800 sitters. It has a handsome spire, 80 feet 
in height ; which, as it is situated near the centre of the town, 
on rising ground, forms an object of attraction and ornament to 
the town. A missionary has in the meantime been appointed by 
the Presbytery of Irvine, but has not been ordained to the charge, 
in consequence of a process raised before the Court of Session 
against the Presbytery for making a quoad sacra division of the 
parish, and for allowing the minister of this congregation a seat and 
a vote in the Presbytery. The United Secession congregation pay 
their minister L.lOO a-year ; besides, he has a house and a small 
garden. This church was built in 1775, and holds 51 0 sitters, 
A congregational church has been in existence since February 
1827, and holds about 400 sitters. The two last named Congre- 
gations support their own poor, besides contributing liberally to 
other religious purposes. The number of individuals belonging 
to the respective places of worship will be seen from the following 
abstract laid before the Commissioners for Religious Instruction, 
in November 1836:

It is proper to add, that a number of individuals from the sur- 
rounding parishes attend the four congregations named above. 

The church belonging to the Associate congregation was taken 
possession of by a great majority of its members, when they join- 
ed the Church of Scotland ; but upon a summons of declarator in 
March 1841, at the instance of a verv few members of the said 
congregation, who would not unite with the Church of Scotland, 
the majority were induced, rather than run the risk of a law-suit, 
to give up the church. It is now, therefore, unoccupied. It was 
built in 1828. 

The foundation-stone of John Knox's Church, built by the late 
members of the Associate congregation, was laid by Mr Collins 
of Glasgow, 10th September 1841. 

The four congregations here have each libraries superintended 
by their respective ministers. 

Education. — There is but one parochial school in the parish. 
The schoolmaster, elected on the 3d January 1788, has had an as- 
sistant since May 1837. Besides the ordinary branches, Latin, 
Greek, French, geography, mathematics, theoretical and practical, 
&amp;c. are taught. His salary is the maximum, with the legal allow- 
ance for a garden. The wages are, for reading English per 
quarter, 2s. 6d. ; for do. and writing, 3s. ; for do. and arithmetic, 
Latin, &amp;c. &amp;c. 5s. The sura of fees received does not amount to 
L. 30 ; all given to the assistant, who teaches gratis ten poor chil- 
dren recommended by a majority of the session, on account of u 
mortification of L.5 per annum, left by the late Mr William Smith 
of Cutstraw. There are at present four private schools in town, 
and three in the country part of the parish. There is no library 
belonging to any of the schools. 

Library. — There is a library, commenced in 1810, consisting 
of an excellent collection and selection of books on all subjects, 
besides some of the leading periodicals of the day. There is also 
a reading-room in town, not attached to the library. 

Friendly Societies. — There are a number of these in town. They 
give liberally to the sick and indigent, and are understood to pros- 
per. There is also a savings bank. 

Bank. — Branches of the Union Bank of Glasgow, since the be- 
ginning of 1836, and of Messrs Hunters and Co. of Ayr, since 
1841, have been established here. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — That spirit of independence, which 
formerly characterized the people of Scotland, is rapidly disappear-

Fuel. — Coals form the chief article of fuel, and are expensive. 
They are brought from Kilmaurs, Kilmarnock, or Irvine pits, and 
cost 7s. for four loads, weighing 16 cwt. The nearest pit is five

Miscellaneous Observations. 

Near the farm-house of low Chapelton, above a mile below 
Stewarton, on the right bank of the Annock, there appears to have 
once been a chapel, the ruins of which were lately dug up, when 
the proprietor was engaged in planting trees. There are now no 
records remaining of this place of worship. There are several 
farms in the neighbourhood called Chapelton, which are under- 
stood to have derived their name from this place. 

Of the three founders of the Maitland Club of Glasgow in 
1828, only one survives, John Kerr, Esq. writer, .Glasgow, and 
he is a native of this parish.

I. Topography and Natural History. 

Etymology. — Toubolton or Tarbolton, also in charters written 
Thorbolton, the name both of the parish and village, appears de- 
scriptive of the situation of the village, and of the use to which 
the beautiful round hill, close to which the village is built, was 
anciently applied. Tor means a round hill, on which Thar was 
worshipped. It has also a more general signification, and denotes 
any round hill, as is ordinarily the import of the word when ap- 
phed to places in Britain. Tor or Thor of the Goths is the same 
God, whose name receiving a different pronunciation from the 
Celts, forms the first syllable of the names of many celebrated 
persons and places, as Tar-quin, Tar-entum, Tar-tary Tor, or 
more correctly Thor, is the Saxon, Tar, the Celtic pronuncia- 
tion of a word descriptive of the most remarkable and beautiful 
object in the neighbourhood, the hill mentioned by Burns in his 
poem of Dr Hornbook—" I had gaen round about the hill." 
Bol is the name of the god of the Druids, f Some super- 
stitious rites, anciently observed in honour of this eastern god, 
are annually performed on the hill. On the evening preceding 
the Torbolton June fair, a piece of fuel is demanded at each 
house, and is invariably given even by the poorest inhabitant. 
The fuel so collected is carried to a particular part of the hill, 
where there is an altar or circular fire-place of turf, about three 

 The Thor of the Celto- Scythians of Germany was the Tar-anis of their neigh- 
bours of the south. In the ancient language of the Scots, both the names of this 
divinity are retained to this day. Macpherson's Dissertations, page 341. See also 
Histoire de Dannemarc par Mallet, Tom. ii p. 88. 

t The name of this Pagan divinity is pronounced in the Gaelic Bal, Bel. or Bol 
indifferently. It is Bol on the ancient coin in the possession of the Earl of Morton, 
of which an engraving is given in the Phil. Trans. Vol. Ivii Bart I. page 267. In 
the Palmyrine Inscriptions it is Bol, sometimes Bl ; and so becomes Bal, or Bel, or 
Bol, according to the vowel which is supplied. See Swinton on the Palmyrine In- 
scriptions, Phil. Trans. Vol. xlviii. Part II. page 736— and Dawk, Mar. Pnlmyren.

feet ill height, and is placed upon the altar. A huge bonfire is 
kindled, and many of the inhabitants, old and young, men and 
women, assemble on the hill and remain for hours, apparently 
chiefly o.ccupied with observing a feat performed by the youths, 
who are to be seen leaping with indefatigable zeal upon the altar 
or turf wall, inclosing the ashes of former fires, and supporting the 
present one. It appears from sacred Scripture, that the worship 
of Baal consisted in part of leaping upon bis altar ; " And they 
leaped upon the altar which was made." 1 Kings, xviii. 26. 
Though our translators, following, as regards pronunciation, the 
guidance of what is now well known to have been a comparatively 
recent contrivance, the Rabbinical or Masoretic points, have vcrit 
ten the name of the false god so worshipped Baal, yet the name 
given to him in the original is Bol. So that Tor or Tar, or I'hor- 
Bol-ton or town, is the town at Baal's hill, i. e. the town at the 
hill where Baal was worshipped. 

Topographical Appearance. — The parish is characterized by its 
undulatory appearance ; the waves or ridges rarely reaching au 
elevation of 400 feet above the level of the sea, and being all un- 
der culture, except where covered with trees. The parish contains 
scenes of much natural beauty, particularly 6n the richly wooded 
banks of the winding Ayr. From some of the elevations, popu- 
larly called hills, the prospect is extremely interesting, from its 
variety, and richness, and extent, comprising the entire course of 
the Ayr from its source to its mouth — the great valley of Ayrshire, 
which stretches from the Doon to Ardrossan, a distance of nearly 
twenty miles. At a greater distance, there are the Cumnock hills, 
the Carrick hills, the Frith of Clyde, Ailsa, the Argyleshire hills, 
and the Kilbirnie hills. More remote still, in favourable states of 
the atmosphere, may be seen Cairnsmuir, in Galloway, the pro- 
montory of Fair-head, in county Antrim, Benlomond, and Ben 
More ; and, surpassing all these in loveliness and grandeur, Arran, 
to which Ayrshire scenery is in no small degree indebted for tlie 
impression which it never fails to make on the traveller. 

Boundaries, c. — The parish is of irregular shape, and is bounded 
on the north, by the parish of Craigie ; on the east, by Mauchline ; 
on the south, by Stair; and on the west, by St Quivox and Monkton. 

The village is six miles, and the western boundary of the pa- 
rish three and a-half miles, from the sea-coast. The extreme 
\ength of the parish is seven miles; its greatest breadth four. 



TOUBOLTON. ' 



Towards the south-western extremity, the breadth is about haf a- 
mile. The superficial extent is about 12,500 imperial acres.  
Hydrography.— ThQ river Ayr forms the southern boundary o. 
the parish for an extent taking its meanderings into the account 
of about ten miles. It is chiefly remarkable, as compared with 
the other rivers of Scotland, for its dark colour, which it derives 
from two sources— the alluvial matter which is carried along by ir, 
and the dark colour of the strata composing its channel and banks. 
There has been a very considerable loss of life in the Ayr, owing 
to the darkness of its waters, concealing from the view of persons 
who had ventured into it, deep places, with which the river abounds, 
termed in the provincial dialect " Weels," almost every " weel" 
bearing the name of some person who has perished in it. Several 
streams rise in the pari&amp;h. The only one requiring notice is the 
" Fail," which rises in Lochlee, and after passing the monastery of 
Fail, and flowing through Fail Loch and Torbolton Loch, enters 
the pleasure-grounds connected with Coilsfield House, and dis- 
charges itself into the Ayr, at a place which has recently received 
the name of Failford. The parish abounds with springs. On the 
summit of Torcorse-hill, one of the highest spots in the parish, 
there is a pond, which continues filled with water at all seasons. 

Three plains, flooded during the winter months to feed three 
small mills, are dignified with the name of lochs, and are called 
Lochlee, Fail Loch, and Torbolton Loch. About two years ago 
the Duke of Portland, with that enlightened liberality which cha- 
racterizes him, relieved his tenantry from their thirlage to Millburn 
Mill, and allowed them to carry their corn to that mill or to any 
other. The consequence is, that the Millburn mill-wheel has be- 
come silent, and Lochlee Loch is being converted into arable 
ground. It is hoped that a similar fate awaits the other two lochs 
and mills. It is to be regretted that agricultural improvement 
should be materially impeded, and a large expanse of deep loam 
kept in a state of morass to supply with water those small mills, 
which, without injury to any party, could be placed lower down the 
Fail, or on the Ayr, where there is abundant water-power. 

Geology. — The parish of Torbolton is occupied by three for- 
mations—red sandstone older than the coal, the coal, and the 
trap. 



• In a work distinguished for its general accuracy, " Alton's Survey of Ayrshire," 
there is a considerable error in regard to the extent of Torbolton parish, which is 
stated i. 716 to contain 22,000 Scotch acres.

AYUSniRE. 



Red Sandstone vlder than the Coal. — Entering Ayrshire from the 
north by the coast road, the strata are cooiposed of old red sand- 
stone, and are to be seen at Ardrossan, dipping under the coal 
measures. Towards the southern limit of the county, a short way 
beyond Dalmellington, we have the red sandstone resting on the 
graywacke, and supporting the coal measures. In the centre of 
the county, the red sandstone developes itself extensively, occu- 
pying the eastern portion of Torbolton parish, and part of the pa- 
rishes of Craigie, Mauchline, Stair, Sorn, and Auchinleck. It 
is this rock which forms the bright red cliffs which add so much to 
the picturesque beauty of the scenery at Auchinleck on the Lugar, 
and of Coilhome wood and Barskimming on the banks of the Ayr. 

The age and position of the sandstone relatively to the coal, 
seem deservmg of attention, because of the extent occupied by 
this deposit, and because the expectation has been entertained by 
some that, by penetrating through it, coal may be found. It has 
great uniformity of appearance, and has a thickness of upwards of 
100 feet in many places, as at the localities on the Ayr and Lugar 
already named. On the south bank of the Ayr, at a place called 
Clune dam, the red sandstone has a thickness of only a few feet, 
and here the strata with which it is associated become visible. 

There are, \. Stratified trap. 

No. 2. Grey sandstone somewhat indurated. 

No. 3. Dark red slaty argillaceous sandstone. 

No. 4. Soft, loosely aggregated, red sandstone. 

No. 5. Soft, loosely aggregated, red sandstone. This is a very 
beautiful rock, being chiefly composed of minute translucent, sphe- 
rical, carnelian-coloured granules. 

No 6, Variegated slaty and argillaceous sandstone. 

No. 7. Micaceous argillaceous sandstone passing into an iron-

to the south-west, at an angle of 10°.

the bed of the Fail near Coilsfield House, and in the bed of a deep 
ravine to the west of Auchinleck House. 

Beyond the northern boundary of Torbolton parish, it appears 
to pass under the coal strata. 

Coal— The south-western part of this parish, and also a patch 
in the north-eastern quarter, are portions of the Ayrshire coal-field. 

What first deserves notice in regard to it, is the water- of- Ayr- 
stone, or hone. This is a variety of indurated fire-clay, which at 
Enterkine, in the parish of Torbolton, at Dalmore, in the parish 
of Stair, also near St Quivox manse, and at Curreath, in Dun- 
donald parish, is to be found immediately under the soil, covermg 
the coal measures, and dipping conformably to them. It appears 
to be one of the coal measures. It varies in coarseness, in hard- 
ness, and also in colour, being blue, and blue with brown specks, 
yellow, and brown. In all the localities in which it has been seen, 
trap occurs in its vicinity.

This last mentioned stratut is at the depth of 47 fathoms. It 
is 7 feet in thickness, and of excellent quality. Fibrous anthra- 
cite may be noticed not unfrequently in the coal. 

Coal mines were worked in Torbolton parish so early as the year 
1497. 

The Trap. — The coal district occupying the south-western por- 
tion of the parish is separated from the red sandstone by a band or 
dike of a very peculiar description of trap, which has been traced by 
the writer from Meadow Bank, in Stair parish, across the parishes 
of Torbolton and Craigie to the neighbourhood of Symington, a 
distance of about eight miles. Offsets from this dike, forming ridges 



746

and knolls, give to the parish its iindulatory appearance. Clime- 
dam, Cairngillan ridge, Alton-burn, "the Hill," and Torcorse 
Hill, are portions of this remarkable mass of trap. Its direction 
is north by west. It may average in breadth half-a-mile. It is -i 
porphyritic and amygdaloidal trap; the amygdaloidal structure pre'- 
vaihng in some places, and the porphyritic in others. The amyg- 
daloidal portions are chiefly calcareous 'spar, while the crystals 
which give It the porphyritic character are apparently of hornblend 
or augite, much decomposed and highly coloured by oxide of iron. 
The dike along its whole extent abounds in steatite. It decays 
rapidly from the action of air and moisture on the iron and calca- 
reous matter, and, consequently, is a bad road metal, but it gives 
rise to a fertile soil. 

Organic Remains. —Omvig to the deep covering of alluvial mat- 
ter, opportunities of examining the contents of the different strata 
rarely present themselves. There is an upthrow of the strata in 
the adjacent parish of Craigie, in the neighbourhood of a green- 
stone ridge. The following organic remains are met with in the 
Craigie shale and limestone. The list is given because little at- 
tention has hitherto been paid to the organic remains with which 
this district abounds. It will be seen to contain one or two rather 
rare species.

the banks of the Ayr. The otter {Lutra vulgaris inhabits the 
P'ail. A white mole is occasionally met with in this district, more 
frequently near Kilmarnock. As it occurs, year after year, in the 
same localities, it is probably a permanent variety. The king's 
fisher {Alcedo ispida inhabits the Fail. Torbolton Loch is a fa- 
vourite resort and breeding-place of the snipe {Scolopux Galiinago. 
A small snake is to be found in the woods on the banks of the Ayr, 
but the writer has not seen a specimen. That beautiful harmless 
reptile {Lacerta agilis the lizard, seems to benefit by the climate 
of Ayrshire, and is apt to abound in farm-yards, if ducks are not 
kept.

modation and breeding places for this animal, its increase to a vast 
extent would be the result, were it not for the activity and courage 
of the natural enemy of the rat, the weasel {Mustela vulgaris. 
It is unfortunate that there should be a general prejudice against 
this creature, the most dexterous, the most indefatigable, and the 
cheapest of all rat-catchers. 

Botany. Owing to the mildness and moisture of the climate, 

many flowering shrubs, originally outcasts from gardens, propagate, 
and are to be met with in hedge-rows and woods, while plants, un- 
questionably of native origin, exhibit unusual richness and beauty. 
Such is the case with the beautiful Memjanthes trifoliata and Par- 
nassia palustris in Torbolton Loch. In this loch also, the Ranun- 
culus aquatilis is to be seen, having its usual single row of petals, 
but tracing it along till it approaches the central ditch, or main 
got, as it is called, when its roots penetrate into rich mud, it ac- 
quires a double row of petals. The Trolliiis Europeus, Geranium 
sylvaticum, and a white variety of foxglove, occurring in Coilhome 
wood, deserve notice. The Solanum dulcamara, with its clusters 
of purple flowers, adorns the hedge-rows near Privick Mill. The 
Orchis exhibits itself on shaded banks in great profusion, and is 
designated by some aged persons of the parish, by a name which 
vies in beauty with the plant to which it is applied, " the belldera." 

II. — Civil History. 
" The Hiir or ' Tor-hoW — The Hill is a beautiful green 
knoll surmounted by an artificial summit termed " the Moat." 
The hill has, in diff"erent states of society, been used for very dis- 
similar purposes. It has already been spoken of as a place of ido- 
latrous worship. One of those implements of stone termed celts 
used by the Druids for cutting the misseltoe, and probably also 
for slaying the human or other victim to be off'ered in sacrifice, 
was, a few years ago, dug up when cutting a drain in a field 
about a mile to the north-west of the Hill, and is preserved at the 
manse. The celt is of a hard clay stone, measures ten inches and 
a half in length, one inch and a half in breadth at the narrow end, 
gradually widens till it becomes three inches in breadth, when 
it is brought to a sharp edge, and, being of considerable weight, 
would, when grasped by the middle, according as the narrow and 
blunt or the broad and sharp end was used, inflict a stunning

blow, or serve as a cutting instrument. If we suppose it to have 
been fixed to a handle in the way in which their stone implements 
are attached by the natives of New Zealand to wooden handles, it 
would have the shape of the battle-axe. ' 

,The Hill seems, on some occasions, to have been used as an en- 
campment, as it retains the marks of trenches. The conjecture, 
hazarded by the writer of the former Statistical Account, that it 
was a Danish encampment, is highly improbable, as the roving 
Danes seldom encamped so far in the interior, and, besides, " there 
is no evidence that they ever had any settlement within the Frith 
of Clyde."  

The form of the Hill and its moat, truncated at the top, adapted 
it admirably for the administration of justice. " It was formerly 
the Court-Hill of the Barony of Torbolton ; and the Hall formerly 
built on this mount was the chief messuage of the barons, where 
seisin was given of the same." -f- 

Across a small brook, and on the summit of an elevated piece 
of ground to the south-east, is a place still termed " the Gallow- 
Hill." 

About a century ago, the hill was rented by Mr John Hood, 
the parish schoolmaster, and was the play-ground of his scholars ; 
in consequence of which it has acquired the name of " Hood's- 
Hill." 

Fail. — A mile north from Torbolton, in the suppressed parish 
of Barnweill, and at the western extremity of Fail Loch, encircled 
by a few ash and elm trees, are the ruins of the monastery of Fail 
or Failford, once a place of some note, and which still enjoys 
much celebrity from the mention made of the friars in the sarcas- 
tic lines preserved by Ramsay in the Evergreen, and quoted by 
Walter Scott in the Abbot. J 

• Chalmers's Caledonia, Vol. iii. page 435. 
•f- Privy Seal Register, quoted by Chalmers. 

\ " The Friars of Fail dratik berry. brown ale, 
The best that ere was tasted, 
The monks of Melrose made gude kale, 
On Fridays, when they fasted." 
Another version of this stanza has been preserved. 

" The Friars of Fail 
Gat never owre hard eggs, or owre thin kale ; 
For they made their eggs thin wi' butter. 
And their kale thick wi' bread ; 
And the Friars of Fail they made gude kale 
Oil Fridays when they fasted, 
And they never wanted gear enough 
As long as their neighbours lasted." 



TOUBOLTON. 



749 



Fail was founded in 1252, and belonged to the Red Friars. 
They were called Mathurines, from the house of this order ui 
Paris dedicated to St Mathurine; and " patres de Redemptione 
captivorum," as it was apart of their duty to redeem captives from 
slavery. The name of the founder is unknown. The chief who 
ruled this convent was styled " minister." The minister of Fail- 
ford was Provincial of the Trinity Order in Scotland. From being 
the head of the order, he had a seat in Parliament. 

John de Graham, Lord of Torbolton, grants by his charter, of 
date September 21st 1335, given at Falle, the patronage of the 
church of Torbolton, with the lands of Wnzank, on which the 
church is built, to his cousin Robert de Graham of Welston. 

The earliest of the " Friars of Faill" in regard to whom any-, 
thing has been ascertained is " Brother John," who was the chief 
or minister of Failford in the year 1343. There are some docu- 
ments extant, relating to this " Brother John" and a " White 
Horse," which seem deserving of notice as bringing to light some 
of the methods taken by monks and friars for obtaining land and 
patronage, and displaying the ignorance and credulity of land- 
owners in Scotland in the fourteenth century. In a notarial in- 
strument dated November 25, 1343,t " Johannes de Graham, 
nuper Dominus de Torbolton, confesses, that, after his grant to 
his cousin Robert de Graham, which grant had been confirmed 
by the Seneschal of Scotland, and approved by the chapter of 
Glaso-ow, ' Brother John,' minister of the House of the Holy 
Trinity at Ffele, in the diocese of Glasgow, had given him a 
White' Horse for the right of patronage to the church of Tor- 
bolton, which horse the said ' minister John' had afterwards for- 
cibly taken away manu forti abstuHt from the said John de 
Graham This confession was made at Tor- 
bolton, in the church of that parish, before Thomas de Gedwrath, 
monk of the Cistertian Order, and others." 

Another document, entitled " Revocatio Johannis de Graham 
filii," sets forth, " that things which are done through impetuosity of 
temper and facility of disposition, are revocable ; that, being igno- 
rant of law, ' Brother John, of the House of the Holy Trinity of 
Ffele, in the diocese of Glasgow, had, by his flatteries and most 
pernicious present non sine munere pessimo persuaded him to " 
annul his former grant to his dear cousin, Robert Graham of Wal- 
ston, of the right of patronage to the church of Torbolton and

will subject himself, as is fitting, to the correction due to his of- 
fence. Datum apud Torbolton, 21 Feb. for the salvation of his 
soul and that of Emma, his wife." 

A charter by Robert de Graham of Weilstoji, granting to the 
monks of Melrose the patronage to the church of Torbolton and to 
the seven acres of the lands of Unthank, and to the three acres of 
Carnegolayn, the nearest to the church,— and another charterf by 
the same Robert de Graham, conveying to the monks of Melrose, 
for the salvation of his soul, and that of Emma, his wife, the fol- 
lowing lands situate in the territory and lordship of Torbolton, viz. 
" Dernehunche, Quyltisfeld, Coilsfield and Auldtounbrune," 
—give us to understand why John de Graham was compelled to 
make and to put on record such humiliating confessions ; and show 
that the affair of the white horse was a struggle betwixt the 
monks of Melrose, and the friars of Fail, for the increase of their 
patronage, and the extension of their lands— John de Graham 
being the dupe of the one party, and Robert de Graham the prey

The monks of Melrose, by a promise to Robert of what they 
could not give, " salvation for his soul and that of his wife," had 
obtained from him not only theadvowson to Torbolton church and 
glebe, but also a grant of the estate of Coilsfield and other valua- 
able lands. 

The superior of Fail, his flatteris, and by the gift of the horse, 
had prevailed with John de Graham to convey to the house of 
Fail what was no longer his to bestow. 

Neither John de Graham nor Robert de Graham appears to 
have been able to write his own name. Each charter bears that the 
person granting it had affixed his seal before witnesses. 

In the descrption of the lands of the burgh of Prestwick, drawn 
up 1470, mention+ is made of a John Quhit of Fale, " that acht sum 
tyme a certain piece of laud in Prestwick, the annuel of which he 
had given stat of to our Lady of Grace, and to Tho. of Best in 
her name." 

In 1532, John Hamilton was appointed minister of Failford. 
In 1546 and 1560, the minister of Failford, Robert Cuning 
ham, sat in Parliament among the clergy. 

In 1587, William Wallace was minister of Failford.

In 1619, Walter Whytefurd was minister of Failford. 

The rental of the ministry of Failford, as given up by Robert 
Cuningham, the minister, in 1562, amounted to L. 174, 6s. 8d. 
in money ; 3 chalders of bear ; 15 chalders, 4 bolls of meal ; 30 
stones of cheese; 10 hogs young sheep ; 3stirks young cows ; 
2 dozen grilses or salmon. 

There belonged to this convent five parish churches, viz. the 
churches of Barnwell, Symington, and Galston in Kyle, of Tor- 
thorwald in Dumfries-shire, and the church of Inverchoalan in 
Argyleshire. 

The estate of Fail is the property of Colonel Thomas Hunter 
Blair, of Brownhill and Dunskey. The estate and the monastery 
are in retours sometimes called Fail, but more frequently Failford. 
The latter name is the designation given in the coimty valuation 
book to the lands on which the ruin is situate. Nothing of the 
monastery now remains, saving one gable and part of a side-wall 
of the manor-house of the chief or minister. 

King CoiVs Tomb.— To the south of Coilsfield House, and im- 
mediately west of the farm- offices, is a circular mound, enclosed 
by a hedge, and planted with oak and other trees. On the centre 
and highest part of this mound, are two large stones, masses of ba- 
salt— which, according to tradition, mark the spot where the mor- 
tal remains of Old King Coil were deposited. The names borne 
by places in the vicinity are in keeping with this tradition. The 
beautiful mansion adjoining, one of the seats of the Earl of Eglin- 
ton, is named Coilsfield, L e. the field of Coil. Kyle, the name 
of the central district of Ayrshire, is supposed to be the same word 
Coil, spelled in accordance with the vulgar pronunciation of the 
name. A little brook that empties itself into the Fail is called 
" The Bloody Burn," and so testifies by its name, of the blood by 
which its waters had, on some memorable occasion, been polluted ; 
and a flat alluvial piece of ground along the Fail, opposite the 
mouth of the bloody burn, is still called " The Dead-men's-holm," 
probably from its having been the burial-place of the soldiers. 
High authority. — Chalmers, author of the Caledonia, denies that 
there ever was such a person as King Coil. Although it is well 
known that that author at times allows himself to be carried away 
by an undue love of theory, still his scepticism has had the effect 
of degrading into inere fable, in the estimation of many, tradition- 
ary history, in regard to the west of Scotland. Regard, therefore, 
for traditionary evidence, respect for the memory of the mighty

dead, and love of historical truth, combined to render it desirable 
that Coil's grave should be opqned. Accordingly, in May 1837, 
the two large stones were removed. The centre of the mound was 
fourid to be occupied by boulder stones, some of them of conside- 
rable size. When the excavators had reached the depth of about 
four feet, they came on a flag-stone of a circular form about three 
feet in diameter. 

Under the circular stone, was first a quantity of dry yellow co- 
loured sandy clay, then a small flag-stone laid horizontally, cover- 
ing the mouth of an urn filled with white-coloured burnt bones. 
In removing the dry clay by which this urn was surrounded, un- 
der-flat stones, several small heaps of bones were observed, not 
contained in urns, but carefully surrounded by the j'ellow-coloured 
clay mentioned above. The urns in shape resemble flower-pots ; 
they are composed of clay, and have been hardened by fire. The 
principal urn is 7 inches in height, 7| inches in diameter, |ths 
of an inch in thickness. It has none of those markings, supposed 
to have been made by the thumb nail, so often to be observed on 
sepulchral urns, and it has nothing of ornament except an edging 
or projecting part about half-an inch from the top. No coins, or 
armour, or implements of any description could be found. 

The discovery of these urns renders evident, that, at a very re- 
mote period, and while the practice of burning the dead still pre- 
vailed — that is to say, before the introduction of Christianity — 
some person or persons of distinction had been deposited there. 
The fact of sepulchral urns having been found in the very spot 
where, according to an uninterrupted tradition, and the statements 
of several historians. King Coil had been laid, appears to give to 
the traditionary evidence, and to the statements of the early Scot- 
tish historians, in regard to Coil, a degree of probability higher 
than they formerly possessed. 

According to Bellenden, in his translation of Hector Boece, 
' Kyle is namit frae Coyll, Kyngof the Britons, quhilk was slain 
in the same region." Buchannan states, " that the Scots and Picts 
surprised the camp of the Britons in the night, and put almost the 
whole of them to the sword, Coilus, King of the Britons, was 
among the slain in this engagement, and the district in which the 
battle was fought was afterwards distinguished by his name." 

Other urns were found less indurated, and so frail as to fall to 

pieces when touched. 

An old man remembers that his father, then a tenant on the

Coilsfield estate, turned up pieces of ancient armour and frag- 
ments of bones when ploughing the " dead men's home." 

In Bleau's Atlas, the following passage occurs, " Aerae vicomita- 
tus Coilam, a Coilo Brittanorum Rege. . . In campo ubi decerta- 
tum Cituus incurvus figura sua cornu referens, in primus canovus, 
multo post annis effossus est, quo comarchi Caprintonii, quorum 
aedes primarise nostris Coilsfield dicitur, ad cogendos rusticos 
suos et operarios utuntur." 

Defoe, in his Tour through Britain, makes a similar statement, 
and translates this passage, but does so without referring to the 
original, or quoting the authority of the celebrated Robert Gor- 
don of Straloch, by whom the narrative accompanying the maps of 
Scotland was, at the request of King Charles I., furnished to the 
Messrs Bleau of Amsterdam.f 

' A trumpet resembling a crooked horn, which has a very shrill 
sound, was dug up in the field of battle, and is still kept in the 
Laird of Caprington's house called Coilsfield, and made use of 
to call his servants and workmen together."

+ In a manuscript volume of poems and miscellaneous pieces now in the posses- 
sion of David Constable, Esq. Advocate, written about the year 1631, the author, 
John Bonar, schoolmaster. Ayr, gives in verse an account of a voyage from the port 
of Bangor in Ireland, with a description of some of the objects of natural curiosity 
and antiquity of the coast of Carrick, from Loch Ryan to Ayr. In this volume 
the following passage occurs : 

" The britones marchet, tuo dayes before the feild 

To Marrok's mote, for easement and for beildj 

Afore the night they waughtet liquor fyne, 

Lyke filthie beasts lying like drunken swine.

This horn, so minutely described in Bleau's great work and by 
De Foe, is carefully preserved at Caprington Castle. It corresponds 
exactly with the description given of it, and it retains its shrill 
sound. There is no tradition in the family as to when or where 
the trumpet was found, and nothing was known of its history when 
the writer made inquiry concerning it. 

The detail given in the subjoined metrical extract seems im- 
portant, as it reconciles the historical narratives in regard to Coyl 
with the traditionary account and the monumental testimony. 
The early historians speak of the battle having been fought in 
Carrick, near the Doon, while the tomb and names of a variety 
of places, and also tradition, go to fix Coilsfield as the place of 
the King's death. According to Bonnar, Coil's troops were sur- 
prised and routed on the Doon, but the King and the remnant 
of his army proceeded northwards, and were overtaken and slain 
at a moor. 

' The country people fra thenceforth does it call 
Coylsfield in Kyle as ever more it shall." 

It perhaps deserves to be remarked that the name of the gardener's 
house at Coilsfield is Middle-muir. 

Taliesin, who flourished in the sixth century, in his poem on 
the battle of Argoed Llwyfain, speaks of " Cheneu, son of Coel." 

Roman Camp and Sepulchral Urns. — At Park- Moor there is a 
place called the Roman Camp, where trenches are to be seen. 
Sepulchral urns were found under cairns near the camp. An urn 
was also found under a cairn of stones on the farm of Law. It 
is highly ornamented with markings, made apparently with the 
thumb-nail, and is in excellent preservation. Sepulchral urns 
"were recently discovered about a quarter of a mile northwards from 
Fail Monastery. When levelhng a piece of ground a large flat 
stone was found five feet below the surface. Under the stone 
was a small pit, or grave, in which were two urns containing burnt 
bones. The urns fell to pieces soon after being exposed to the 
atmosphere. Two other flat stones have been met with, each 
covering a small pit. There was an urn in one of these pits. 
The other had no urn, but contained a considerable quantity of 
burnt bones. This very ancient depository for the dead exhibits 
evidence of scrupulous attention having been paid to order. The 
pits, which are rudely lined with stones, resemble each other in

shape, being wider towards the one end than at the other. Such 
is also the case with the flag-stones which covered the pits. Two 
of the pits run north-east and south-west; the third stretches 
north-west and south-east. These pits or graves are so situate 
relatively to each other, that straight lines, connecting a point in 
the centre of each of them, would form an equilateral triangle, the 
length of each side being eight feet. The Druids, who, in the 
period of heathenism, were the priests, the judges, and the magi- 
cians of the west of Europe, regarded the making of processions 
in certain geometrical figures, and the placing of stones in certain 
numbers and forms, as being in importance inferior only to their 
horrid practice of offering up human sacrifices. " They were ex- 
pelled," says Selden in his Janus Anglorum, " from France by 
Tiberius, from Rome by Claudius, from Britain by Christianity." 

Eminent Men — Coil. — The name of Coil is so interwoven with 
the traditionary history of the west of Scotland, that we cannot 
but take special notice of him among the eminent men connected 
with the parish in which he found a grave. He was king of the 
Britons or Welsh, but had extended his conquests over a conside- 
rable part of Scotland. It has been maintained by some, that his 
daughter Helena was the mother of the first Christian emperor, 
Constantine the Great. 

Owing to forgetfulness of King Coil, there has been much 
eager disputation as to the correct reading of an adage of unknown 
antiquity, which sets forth something characteristic of each of four 
districts of the west country. The most northerly part of Ayr- 
shire is called Cuningham. " Cuning means a butter churn, and 
Cuningham, the churn district." 

Carrick also had anciently high celebrity. Speaking of Car- 
rick, Maister John Bellenden says : " In this region are money 
fait ky and oxen, of quhilk the flesh is rycht delicious and tender. 
The tallow of their wambis is so sappy that it fresis never, but 
flows ay be nature of the self in manner of oulie."f 

That which has given its distinctive name to the central dis- 
trict of Ayrshire, is mentioned both by historians and poets. 
" Kyle namit fra Coyll Kyng of Brittons," or, as Burns has ex- 
pressed it, 

" Twas in that place o' Scotland's isle, 
That bears the name o' auld King Coil."

Hence the adage, 

" Kyle for a man, Carrick for a cow, 

Cunningham for butter and cheese, and Galloway for woo." 

Peden. — The Rev. Alexander Peden, whose memory is much 
revered in the west of Scotland, held the office of schoolmaster in 
Torbolton. After he became a minister, and durino- the time of 
the Persecution, he frequently preached at a secluded spot in the 
Coilhome wood, called Peden's Pulpit. A short way up the river 
there is a hollow place in the face of a cliff, to which he used to 
retire after preaching, called Peden's Cove. The pulpit is a jut- 
ting out mass of red sandstone overlooking a level piece of ground 
bounded by the Ayr, and hid from view by precipitous cliffs and 
lofty banks covered with copsewood. It is remembered that many 
of his admiring hearers used to assemble before the pulpit with 
their loaded firelocks in their hands — a precaution not unnecessary, 
as is abundantly testified by the subjoined inscription on a tomb- 
stone in Torbolton church-yard. 

Woodhill is on the banks of the Ayr, about two miles up the 
river from Peden's Pulpit. 

The Rev. Dr William Ritchie. — Torbolton was the earliest pas- 
toral charge of the late Dr William Ritchie, one of the ministers 
of the High Church of Edinburgh, and for about twenty years 
Professor of Divinity in the University of Edinburgh. He was an 
accomplished scholar, an eloquent preacher, and a profound theo- 
logian. During the period of his filling the Divinity Chair, the 
number of theological students at Edinburgh greatiy increased, 
and a large proportion of the present clergy of the Church of 
Scotland were educated under him. In consequence of advanced 
age and repeated attacks of dangerous illness, he, in 1827, re- 
signed his professorship. When he was unable longer to labour 
in word and doctrine, he had the consolation to know that his for- 
mer pupils were now the faithful preachers of those precious truths 
which it had been the business of his life to teach to others, and 
which proved his own support in the prospect of deatii. He pas- 
sed the remainder of his days at Torbolton manse, where he died 
in January 1829. He was interred in the church-yard of this pa- 
rish, in the very spot on which he was ordained to the office of the 
holy ministry.

Burns.--Rohevt Burns spent the happiest of his days and wrote 
the best of his poems at Lochlee, in the upper part of this parish. 
Many of the locaHties around are alluded to in his writings. Young 
men of the parish were the members of the Debating Club which 
he established at Torbolton, and his " dear brothers of the mys- 
tic tye." Daughters of the small farmers, and servant girls ot the 
neighbourhood, were the beauties whose charms he has immorta- 
lized. T • +V, 

Thorn.— A thatched cottage, about a mile from Lochlee, is tue 
birth-place of the most successful of all the illustrators of Burns, 
the self-taught artist Thom, whose Tarn o' Shanter and Souter 
Johnny form a new era in the history of sculpture. 

Mansion-houses.— Coilsjield House, the property of the Earl of 
Eglinton, is an elegant modern mansion, beautifully situate on the 
southern bank of the Fail rivulet, and embosomed among rich 
woods. 

" There summer first unfaulds her robes, 
And there they langest tarry.'" 

It is mentioned by Burns under the name of " The Castle of 
Montgomerie," in his beautiful song of " Highland Mary," and 
was a°favourite resort of the poet during the time of his residence 
at Lochlee. Mary Campbell, the heroine of the song, and the 
person addressed in his pathetic stanzas beginning with 

" Thou lingering star with lessening ray, 
That lovest to greet the early morn," &amp;c. 

was one of the domestic servants at Coilsfied, and the object 
one of his warmest attachments. 

The other residences in the parish are, Enterkine, Smithston 
House, Drumley, and Afton Lodge. 

Land-owners.— The chief land-owners are, The Right Honour- 
able the Earl of Eglinton ; John Bell of Enterkine, Esq. ; His 
Grace the Duke of Portland ; Samuel Cooper of Smithston, Esq. ; 
Hugh Hamilton of Halrig, Esq. ; Colonel Thomas Hunter Blair of 
Brownhill ; Colonel S. Neill of Barnweill ; James Oswald of Auch- 
encruive, Esq. ; William Paterson of Ladykirk, Esq. ; A. M'Haffie 
of Overton, Esq. ; Thomas Davidson of Drumley, Esq. ; William 
Cooper of Temple Bog Wood, Esq. ; James Campbell of Craigie, 
Esq. ; William Patrick of Gillhead, Esq.; Mrs Paterson of Smith- 
field; William Ronald of Bennels, Esq.; Robert Pettigrew of 
Tarshaw, Esq. ; Play Boyde of Law, Esq. ; Alason Cuninghame

Parochial Registers. — The dale of the earhest entry in the re- 
gister of baptisms is 1730. The earliest minute of session is of 
date 1774. The register of baptisms is defective, owing to the 
carelessness of some parents in not having their children registered.

There are five families of independent fortune residing in the 
parish. 

Insane persons, none; fatuous, 1 ; blind, 3; deaf and dumb, 2. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture.— The number of acres in crop, or occasionally 
cultivated is 10,868 imperial. 

The number of acres of meadow land or morass is 436 impe- 
rial ; all of which, without much difficulty, might be brought under 
cultivation. 

The extent of land under plantation and natural wood is 960 
acres imperial. 

iei.— The valued rent of the parish is L.7038, 10s. 2d. Scots. 
The real rent from land is about L. 10,500. The highest rented 
land is L.2, 10s. ; the lowest 15s., the average rent about L.l, .s. 
per Scotch acre. 

Husbandry. — On most farms in the parish, a fourth is ploughed, 
and in that case the rotation is, \st oats, with perhaps an acre or 
two acres of beans; 2rf, oats; 2d, ryegrass; 4.th, 5th, 6th, 1th, 
6ih, pasture. 

In other farms a third is ploughed, and then the rotation is, 1, 
oats; 2d, green crop; 3d, oats; 4th, ryegrass; and the next five 
years pasture. 

Live-stock. — Great attention is paid to the improvement of the 
dairy-stock for which Ayrshire is deservedly so celebrated. 

The mode of making meadow hay in this parish seems to be 
nearly the same as that adopted in England; though the Scotch 
have often been charged with mismanagement of their hay crops. 
Ieases are generally for eighteen or nineteen years. The rents 
of several farms vary with the fiars prices. The average size of 



TORBOLTON. 



759 



farms is about 60 acres. Much ryegrass seed is sold to seeds- 
men ; and the ryegrass is often allowed to stand for seed in land 
which is not in a proper state for a crop so very exhausting. Very 
little wheat is grown, though there are some good wheat lands in 
the parish. The climate is such that the sample is not very fine, 
and the crop is not more profitable than one of oats, taking the 
state in which it leaves the land into consideration. Turnips are 
raised in every farm. Mangel Wurzel, little cultivated, and not 
many carrots are raised. 

As every occupier of land is engaged in tile-draining ; as subsoil- 
ing is coming into use, and as a spirit of improvement is general 
among the farmers, it may be anticipated that the system of hus- 
bandry in this parish will speedily undergo great change. 

There are in the parish four corn-mills, one flour-mill, and three 
tile-works. Most of the farms have thrashing- mills, some of them 
being driven by water power. 

Raw Produce. — The amount of raw produce cannot be accu 
rately given. By inference from precise information as to several 
farms, the value of the gross produce appears to be as follows • 

Produce of e'rain of all kinds, - . L. 8965 0 0 

Pasture, - - - - - - 7634 0 0

Gardens and orchards, ... - 200 0 0 

Coal and other minerals, ... 3847 0 0 

L. 27,566 0 0 

Manufactures. — The weaving of muslin was introduced into 
Torbolton about the year 1794, and increased very rapidly, the 
number of looms in 1813 amounting to more than 120. The 
work, till 1825, was chiefly fine muslins, such as jaconets and 
lawns. At that period many commenced silk-weaving. At first 
Persians, afterwards, in succession, sarsanets, bandanas, satins, and 
velvets, but for three or four years past, new fabrics of mixed ma- 
terials have been more generally required as challes, silk and 
wool, Victorias, silk and cotton, mousselin de laines cotton 
and wool, &amp;c. 

At present the number of occupied looms is 140. The work 
is all got from Glasgow. It gives a considerable circulation of 
money to the place. At the same time, it is to be lamented, that 
the hand -loom weavers are often unable to earn adequate wages. 
There are only a very few looms employed at customer or house- 
hold work. Domestic manufacture, to a great extent, is disconti- 
nued, and a large proportion of the females, both of the village 



760 



AYRSHIRE. 



and the county, have laid aside the spinning-wheel, and are em- 
ployed at sowed work. The Ayrshire work is beautifully: executed 
here, and is the chief source of support to many families. 

At Failford, about two and a-half miles from Torbolton, there is 
a manufactory for hones and razor-strops. The cases for the strops 
are veneered with wood and finished in a very tasteful manner. 
V — Parochial Economy. 
Ihe lands of Torbolton, by a charter oi novodamus, granted by 
Charles II. to John Cunninghame, Esq. of Enterkine, were consti- 
tuted mto a free burgh of barony, with the power of holding within 
the burgh a weekly market on Thursday, and two free fairs annually. 

Two bailies and twelve councillors are elected by the house- 
holders on Christmas eve. A town-house and lock-up-house were 
erected by subscription in 1836. 

Means of Communication.— There is a daily post to and from 
the village, and there are weekly carriers to Glasgow, Kilmarnock, 
and Ayr. The parish is traversed from the west to the east by 
the road from Ayr to Edinburgh, via Murkirk and Douglas Mill, 
and from north to south by the road from Kilmarnock to Dalmel- 
lington. There is a stage-coach daily to Ayr. The princi- 
pal market-towns with which the farmers hold communication are 
Ayr and Kilmarnock, the one being seven and a-quarter, and the 
other eight miles from Torbolton. 

Ecclesiastical State.— The church of Torbolton is described in 
instruments of date 1335, as situate on the lands of Wnsank, also 
written in later documents, Unthank,— seven arable acres of which, 
and three acres of Caryngolayne, the nearest to the church on the 
west side, were given as glebe to the church of Torbolton by John 
de Graham, Lord of Torbolton. There is a curious document 
extant, in the shape of a letter, in the old Norman frank of the 
time, addressed by John de Grahame, Signeur de Torbolton, to all 
who shall see or hear this letter, complaining that Sir Johnde Lyn- 
desay had maliciously, falsely, and wickedly intromitted with the 
church of Torbolton, and with the support and maintenance of Wil- 
liam of Douglas, had presented to said church. He then states 
the grant of the advowson of the church and lands pertaining 
thereto, to his cousin Robert Graham, confirmed by the seneschal, 
and ratified by the see of Glasgow, and that the said Sir John, and 
whoever should maintain him, should be held as intromitters against 
the law of the church and the civil law.

The patronage appears to have gone, with the manor of Tor- 
bolton, to the Stewarts of Dernly, in 1361. John Cameron, the 
Bishop of Glasgow, erected the church of Torbolton into a pre- 
bend, or canonry of the cathedral church of Glasgow. This was 
done with the consent of Sir John Stewart of Dernly, the patron of 
the church thus converted into a prebend ; and the patronage of 
the prebend was settled to belong to him and his heirs. It was 
established at the same time, that a vicar pensioner should have 
the cure of -souls at the parish church, with a stipend of twenty 
merks yearly, and a manse and glebe. The canon who held this 
prebend had the whole revenues of the church of Torbolton, with 
the dedication of twenty merks to the vicar, and he was moreover 
taxed L. 3 a year for the benefit of the cathedral church of Glas- 
gow. The rectory of Torbolton continued a prebend of the church 
of Glasgow till the Reformation ; and the patronage continued 
with the Stewarts of Dernly and Earls of Lennox. In Bagi- 
mont's roll, as it stood .in the reign of James V., the rectory of Tor- 
bolton, and prebend of Glasgow, was taxed L. 1 6, being a tenth 
of its estimated value. At the period of the Reformation, the rec- 
tory and prebend of Torbolton was held by James Chisholm, who 
let the tithes and revenues thereof to Cunningham of Caprington, 
for the yearly payment of L.160, out of which Chisholm paid 
L. 20 yearly to the curate who served the Church of Torbolton, 
and eleven merks yearly to the chaplin who served in his stall with- 
in the quire of Glasgow. Several lands which belonged to the 
church of Torbolton were granted in feu farm to Cuningham of 
Caprington at the period of the Reformation. 

The Honourable Colonel James Montgomery, fourth son of 
Alexander, sixth Earl of Eglinton, obtained by purchase from 
Cuningham of Caprington, the lands of Coilsfield, with the pa- 
tronage of the church, before 1661. 

In 1673, the parish of Barnewell was suppressed, and a large 
portion of itwas-j- annexed to the parish of Torbolton. 

The present church, a handsome building, having a spire ninety 
feet in height, and a clock with four dials, was completed in 1821, 
at an expense of L. 2500. It contains 950 sittings, and is within 
four and a-half miles of the most remote dwelling in the parish. 
The manse is a substantial -excellent house in good repair. 

" Robertson's Ayrshire Families, and Chalmers's Caledonia. 

f Hence it is that lands of Fail or Failford, and the properties of Law and Brown- 
hill, contiguous to the monastery, all of them now in Torbolton parish, are described 
in retours as in the parish of Barnewell. 



AYRSHIRE. 



The glebe contains 4 acres, including the ground occuied by 
the manse, offices, approach, and garden. The portion of the 
glebe which is arable amounts to about three acres, and is worth 
L, 6. There is no grass glebe. 

The stipend consists of 16 chalders, one-half meal, the other 
half barley, and L. 8, 6s. 8d. There are L. 733, 10s. 7d. per an- 
num of unappropriated teinds. The average annual number of 
young communicants is 43. The number of persons who commu- 
nicate in the parish when the Lord's Supper is dispensed, may be 
stated at 720. 

There has for many years been a place of worship belonging to 
the United Secession. The congregation is under the charge of 
a pious clergyman, and consists of very worthy persons, but is not 
numerous. 

There is in the parish an Association for religious purposes. 
The amount of its yearly contributions is about L. 15.

Education. — There are two schools in the village, and one in 
the country part of the parish. The parish schoolmaster has the 
medium salary. There are no natives of the parish upwards of 
fifteen years of age who cannot read. While this is the case, it is 
at the same time true that, during the last ten years, there has been 
a gradual diminution of the proportion of the population attending 
school. Boys are now at the loom, or go down the coal-pit, when 
ten or eleven years of age. Girls at even a more tender age earn 
their subsistence at needle-work. The evil which must result 
from this shortened period of attendance is at present in some de- 
gree mitigated by evening-schools, Sunday-schools, and classes for 
religious instruction. 

Literature. — There is a subscription library in Torbolton, and 
also at the Crawfordston colliery, and there are about 200 small 
volumes for the use of the Sabbath scholars. 

Alms-houses. — The late Alexander Cooper, Esq. of Smithston, 
bequeathed all the money and moveable property of "which he 
died possessed, for the purpose of building and endowing an hos- 
pital for the support of persons of the parishes of Torbolton and 
Mauchline in reduced circumstances, upwards of forty years of age, 
and who have never begged. A very handsome hospital, or rather 
range of alms-houses, has been erected at a place which, about 
thirty years ago, received the name of Failford, and is beautifully 
situate near the junction of the Fail and the Ayr. The hospital 
is designed to accommodate eight persons, and has eight separate 
apartments. The inmates receive a weekly aliment, and have 
each a piece of garden ground. 

Friendly Societies. — There are two Friendly Societies for females 
and one for men, which have proved of great advantage. There is 
also a savings bank. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
on the poor's roll is 20. The average number of persons re- 
ceiving occasional relief is 15. The collection at the church 
doors amounts to L. 37. Such further sum as is required is made 
up by the heritors by voluntary contribution. The average an- 
nual expenditure for the poor inclusive of the expense for collect- 
ing contributions from heritors, is L.IOO. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs held at Torbolton, chiefly for the 
sale of dairy stock, one of them on the first Tuesday of June, O. S., 
the other on the second Tuesday of October, O. S. 

Jnns, Alehouses, 8fc. — 'J'here are eleven places for the sale of

AYRSHIRE. 



spirituous liquors in the village, and eight in the country part of the 
parish. 

The great number of public-houses, and the low price of whis- 
ky, are prejudicial alike to the temporal comfort and moral condi- 
tion of the population. 

Fuel. — The only fuel used is coal. The Weston or Crawford- 
ston colliery is three and a-half miles from Torbolton. The coal, 
which is of excellent quality, costs at the pit 6s. per ton of 20 cwt. 

At Adamhill, two miles from the village, light or cannel coal 
can be obtained at 6s. 8d. per ton of 20 cwt.

THE REV. JOHN STIRLING, D. D. MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Boundaries, c-c. — This parish f is bounded on the north by Ric- 
carton and Galston ; on the east, by Mauchline ; on the south, by 
Tarbolton, &amp;c. ; on the west, by Monkton and Symington. 

Topographical Appearances. — The hills near the church, with 
the exception of a craggy rock -jutting out here and there, are co- 
vered with verdure to the very summit, and although comparatively 
low, being only about 500 feet above he level of the sea, the view 
from them is both extensive and beautiful. The parish contains 
apart of the suppressed parish of Barnweill, the greater part of the 
stipend of Barnweill being transferred to the support of the minister 
of Stair. The parish is, in a direct line, about seven miles long, 
and one and a-half miles broad on an average. 

II. — Civil History. 
Parochial Registers, — These are, l.s, A register of births and 
baptisms. The first baptism recorded is in 1679, and for many 
years this register appears to have been irregularly kept. The 
births commence to be recorded along with the baptisms in 1807, 
and from that time the record is kept pretty regularly. 'Id. A re-

Mansion- Houses. — The mansion-houses in this parish are three ; 
1st, Cairnhill, which consists of two parts separated by an area 
or small space between. The oldest part is a tower that has 
already stood the storms of several centuries, and is still in good 
repair and habitable, and, like other ancient edifices, has been 
strongly built. The other part is comparatively modern, 2d, 
Barnweill is a neat house, built about half a century ago. Sd, 
Underwood is also a commodious house, built about fifty years 
ago, and now occupied by the proprietor and family. 

Only two of the heritors at present reside in this parish. 

Antiquities. — Craigie Castle, a very ancient building, was at one 
time the residence of the Wallaces of Craigie, but is now in a 
state of dilapidation. The castle has been surrounded with a 
moat enclosing about four acres of land ; and the entrance into it 
was at the south-west side by a drawbridge. 

There still exist some artificial mounds, named law-hills on 
which, in former times, persons guilty of crimes, real or supposed, 
are said to have been tried ; but some of them appear to have 
been military encampments, especially the one on Barnweill hill, 
and another near Campcastle.

IV. — Industry. 
This parish is entirely agricultural. 

There are three limestone quarries, and there is one tile-work, 
lately erected, which produces good tiles, and is of great advan- 
tage to the farmers. 

The parish contains coal of different kinds, both what is termed 
dross and cannel coal. The coal has been wrought in several 
places, and at different times, and at one of the works very lately, 
but the working is now discontinued as unprofitable. 

The parish contains about 6300 imperial acres, all fit for cul- 
tivation, except about thirty acres of hills. There are also about 
forty acres of meadow, on which water is kept during winter for 
the use of corn-mills. Part of the hilly ground might be culti- 
vated, but whether profitably or not, is doubtful. About thirty 
years ago, the uncultivated hilly land was double of what it is now. 

There is only one corn-mill, viz. Heughmill. The loch at- 
tached to this covers about twenty acres of the meadow-land. 
There are other two lochs, viz. Fail loch, partly in this parish, 
and partly in Torbolton ; the mill driven by the water of this loch 
is in Torbolton parish. Loch Brown is partly in three parishes, 
viz. Craigie, Mauchline, and Torbolton. The mill driven by its 
water is in the parish of Mauchline. This loch covers nearly a 
hundred acres, and is not dry in summer: and perhaps more than 
the half of it is in this parish. 

The rental of the parish may amount to L. 7700 Sterling, and 
the average rent per imperial acre, exclusive of woods, is L.l, 5s. 
« The length of lease is generally nineteen years. A general im- 
provement in agriculture has taken place ; ploughing is neatly 
executed, and the corners of the fields, and sometimes the borders 
of the hedges delved where the plough cannot reach ; many of the 
grass-fields are cleared of thistles and other weeds, and the hedges 
generally are well kept. But the greatest improvement is that of 
furrow-draining. One of the proprietors, in order to have the drain- 
ing on his property thoroughly executed, pays the whole expense of 
draining, except the carting of the tiles, and charges his tenants 
about four per cent, per annum on his expenditure; another pays the 
tiles at the kilns, charging the tenants 1 s. per thousand tiles, which 
comes to nearly five per cent, per annum ; other proprietors assist 
a little, but the greater part of the draining is at the expense of 
the tenants. 

The farm-houses are substantial and commodious About a

Total land in the parish of Craigie, 6300 acres. 

The average size of the farms is about 90 imperial acres. The 
above is exclusive of the turnpike and parish roads, and of that 
part of Loch Brown that is flooded in summer, so that the whole 
contents of this parish are above ten square miles. The produce 
of the oats per acre is from thirty-two to sixty-four imperial bushels, 
average forty-eight bushels per acre. The average produce of 
beans is twenty-four bushels per acre. Potatoes average about 
eight tons per acre ; turnips average about sixteen tons per 
acre: ryegrass weighs about twenty-six cwt. of 112 lbs. each; 
and meadow hay weighs about twenty-eight cwt. per imperial 
acre on an average. Pease are included along with the beans. 
Perhaps there may be five or six acres cff pease. The barley is 
mostly sown for family use. Little flax is sown, and few field-cab- 
bages are raised, perhaps not more than an acre of each. 

Live-Stock. — The live-stock is as follows : 148 horses and mares 
fit for work; 25 bulls, 759 milk cows; 437 young cows, including 
queys, stirks, and calves to be reared ; 293 sheep, mostly of a mixed 
breed ; and 145 swine. The milk of the cows is for the most 
part manufcTctured into sweet milk cheese, and the yearly produce 
of each cow is from 2 4 cwt. to 31 cwt. ; the average is 3 cwt. 
The whey is mostly used in feeding swine. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The church was built in 1776, and the 
manse in 1308 and is in good repair. The stipend consists of 
sixteen chalders of grain, one-half oatmeal, and the other half 
barley, paid by the fiars price of the county, and L. 10 to pro- 
vide communion elements. The glebe contains about five acres, 
and is worth L. 10 per annum. The patronage belongs to James 
Campbell, Esq. of Craigie. 

One hundred and twenty-eight families belong to the Establish- 
ed Church; 3 families belong to the United Secession; and of 



768 



AYRSHIUE. 



Other 9 families, part go to the Established Church, and part to 
the Secession. 

Education. — There are two schools in the parish, the parochial 
school, and one in the south-west end of the parish, at Under- 
bills, near Barnweill, and no additional schools are required, as 
the east end of this parish has the advantage of schools in the vi- 
cinity, one in the parish of Galston, and another in the parish of 
Mauchline. The school-room at Underbills is given free of rent 
by the proprietor, and the teacher is supported by the school-fees. 

The parochial school-bouse was built in 1807. The school- 
master's salary is the maximum ; and the average amount of school- 
fees per annum for ten years is about L. 20 Sterling, making the 
schoolmaster's income about L. 54 per annum, exclusive of house 

and garden. . 

Friendhj Societies.— There are two Friendly Societies for males 
only, and thir expenditure yearly is from L.60 to L.70. 

Poor.— The average number of persons receiving parochial aid 
is 12, who are paid monthly from the poor's funds. A few others 
receive aid occasionally. The average sum paid to each of these 
twelve is L.4, 2s. 5d. per annum. Three of these have aut 
L 6 each ; the rest have considerably less than the average. The 
annual average amount of contributions for relief of the poor for 

the last nine years is L. 51, 19s. Id., viz.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. WILLIAM SINCLAIR, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name and Extent. — In some ancient records of session, the 
name is spelled Kilmares, which appears to be connected with 
the word Marie, and if so, it is probable that the Kil was dedi- 
cated to the Mother of our Lord. Others suppose the name to 
be derived from the circumstance of the church having been de- 
dicated to St Maurs. The length of this parish from east to west 
is six, and the greatest breadth from north to south three, miles. 
It is bounded on the north, by the parish of Stewarton, — east, by 
Fenwick, — south, by Kilmarnock, — and west, by Irvine. 

A rivulet, which rises in Fenwick, and runs the whole length of 
the parish from east to west, divides it nearly into two equal parts. 
This rivulet is known here by the name of Kilmaurs water. A 
little lower it is called Carmel, which name it retains, till it loses 
itself in the Irvine. 

The surface consists of large fields, with many gentle risings 
and declivities interspersed. The summits of these are covered 
with trees, planted in circles, which, with others of the same kind, 
spread all over Cunninghame, give a beautiful appearatice to the 
whole of this country, as well as profit to the owners. The pros- 
pect from these summits, which are in every farm, is extensive and 
delightful ; for many miles all round, the whole country appears 
as one well cultivated garden. 

11. — Civil History. 

Parochial Registers. — The register of births and marriages com- 
menced in 1688, but was not regularly kept till 1783. 

Town of Kilmaurs. — It was erected into a burgh of barony by 
James V. at the instance of Cuthbert Earl of Glencairn, and Wil- 
liam, his son. Lord Kilmaurs. That noble family then resided in 
this parish, where they had a house. By a charter, written in 
Latin, and signed by the said Cuthbert Earl of Glencairn, and 

AYR. 3 c

AVU.SHIRE. 



his son, Lord Kilniaurs, at Glasgow, 15th November 1577 it 
appears, that the five-pound land of Kilmaurs, consistintr 'of 
240 acres, was disponed to forty different persons in feu-farm 
and free burgage, and to be held in equal proportions by 
them, their heirs and successors, upon the yearly payment of 
eighty merks of the usual money of the kingdom, that is, two 
merks for each fortieth part. It is obvious, that the great de-ign 
of the Noble family in this erection, waste bring together into one 
place as many trades-people as possible, and that the feuing of 
these lands was meant as an encouragement and help to sch ; 
but it has all along produced a contrary effect. The town is' 
pleasantly situated on a gentle ascent, looking towards the south. 
The Kilmaurs or Glencairn Family.—The barony of Kil- 
maurs was bestowed, in the beginning of the twelfth century, 
by De Morville, Lord High Constable of Scotland, on Warne- 
bald, who is said to have come from England in the reign of 
Malcolm IV., and who probably assumed the name of Cuning- 
HAME, from the manor place of Cuninghame, in the parish 
of Kilmaurs, supposed to have been about a mile from the town 
in the farm of Jock's Thorn, and probably the original villa 
de Cuninr/hame. The family obtained additional lands from King 
Robert the Bruce. About the beginning of the fifteenth century" 
Sir William Cuninghame married a coheiress of Dennieston of 
that Ilk, and with her acquired great possessions. Alexander of 
the thirteenth generation was raised to the dignity of Earl in 1448. 
Alexander, the fifth Earl, was very favourable to the Reformation, 
and was in consequence distinguished by the name oUhegood Earl 
William, the ninth Earl, lived in the troublous times of Charles I. 
and Oliver Cromwell, and died Chancellor of Scotland in 1664.f 
About this time, the chief family residences seem to have been 
Kerdan Castle, in the parish of Stewarton, and Finlayston, on the 
Clyde above Port- Glasgow. John, the twenty-fifth Earl, died in 
1796, when the honours of this elder branch of the family became 
extinct for want of male issue.

IV. — Industry. 

Agj-icultiire, — This is a very rich parish. There are neither 
barren moors, nor stagnant mosses, nor sterile sand-hills, in- 
creasing the extent of surface without adding much to the rent-roll. 
There is scarcely an acre of bad land in the parish. The soil 
throughout is of first rate quality, strong, and deep, and fertile ; 
yielding heavy crops of wheat, beans, barley, oats, potatoes, &amp;c. 
The pastures are very rich, and dairy produce not only abundant, 
but, from skill in management, of great excellence. 

Great improvements have lately taken place in the agricul- 
ture of the parish by means of tile-draining. 

The average rent of land is about L. 2, 5s. per acre. The 
Scots valuation of the parish is L. 5310. 

Manufactures. — Cotton-weaving and shoemaking are carried 
on to some extent. In days of yore, Kilmaurs was a little Scottish 
Sheffield, and much famed for cutlery. Though the cutlers have 
passed away, their fame survives in the Ayrshire Proverb, " As 
gleg as a Kilmaurs whittle," which cut, it was said, an inch be- 
fore the point. 

' V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — About 1900 of the population belong to 
the Established Church : and about 651 are Dissenters. There 
are also 62 Roman Catholics in the parish. Stipend, 17 chal- 
ders. Glebe 4 acres in extent, and worth about L. 1 2 per an- 
num. 

The manse was built in 1778. It is in a very insufficient and 
comfortless condition. 

It is to be lamented that the parish church is not sufficiently 
ruinous to be legally condemned, for it is far from being such a 
church as should be found in the rich and populous parish of Kil- 
maurs. 

The following is a list of the ministers of this parish since 
the Revolution: — The Rev. David Brown, ordained 1688; the 
Rev, Hugh Thomson, 1691 ; the Rev. John Miller, 1718; the 

 The Rev. Hugh Thomson, the second on the list, was a person of great mus- 
cular strength. We have heard, that, being in Kilmarnock on a market day, he ap- 
proached a stand on which a blacksmith had exposed to sale horse-shoes and other hard- 
ware articles of his own manufacture. Mr Thomson wishing to purchase some of the 
horse-shoes, asked the price of them, and on being told, said by way of joke, " so much 
for these  I could twist them with my fingers." " Twist them then," said the Smith, 
" and you shall have the price of your own making." Mr Thomson took one of them 
up, and twisted it almost with as much ease as Samson broke the green withes with

1806; the Rev. William Sinclair, 1840. 

The late Rev. John Roxburgh, who died in April 1840, will 

long be remembered with much respect in thfs parish. He was a 
man of great worth, talent, and piety, and warmth of affection. Hav- 
ing a powerful mind, he could take a vigorous grasp of his subject 
and set it before his hearers in lucid order, and in a style in which 
there was a pleasing mixture of energy and tenderness. He was 
of very active habits, and unremitting in his endeavours to be ser- 
viceable to his people, visiting them regularly, teaching from house 
to house ; so that he was thoroughly acquainted with the state of his 
parishioners. Indeed, there was not a family, and scarcely an in- 
dividual in his populous parish, that he did not know. He' was re- 
markably well-fitted to be their counsellor ; and Dissenters as well 
as those of his own congregation, came to him in their difficulties, 
as they had complete confidence in the kindness of his heart, and 
the soundness of his judgment. But as the spiritual counsellor 
of his people, he was still more valued. There was not a sick-bed 
that he did not visit; and not a bereaved family which he sought 
not to console. The effect of his care and assiduity was evident 
in the change produced on his parish. He found it as a dry and 
parched land, and he left it as a well-watered garden. He found 
a scattered, wandering people, whose souls had not been cared for ; 
and by the blessing of God on his labours, and watchfulness, and 
prayers, he left a collected, steady church-going people, to lament 
the loss of a faithful minister whom they loved. Such is the fruit 
of a gospel ministry when conducted for a course of years, by a 
person of fluent tongue, a clear head, a pious and kind heart. 

There is a Dissenting congregation in Kilmaurs connected with 
the United Secession Church. The Rev. William Coats having 
been ordained as minister of the parish in the palmy days of pa- 
tronage in 1739, a dissenting congregation was formed in 1740, 
under the Rev. D. Smytane. This was the first Dissenting con- 
gregation in Ayrshire, and it consisted of those who were dissatis- 
fied with the ministry of Mr Coats, and of members from various 



which he was bound. The blacksmith stood agh.nst ; and thinking liis customer 
tin conyiir, he gave him the shoes on very reasonable terms, and was right glad to see 
liis back turnexl

other parishes ; and many of the dissenting congregations that were 
afterwards formed in the surrounding parishes, were offsets from 
this parent congregation. 

After Mr Smytane had been their minister for about forty years, 
dissension arose in the congregation about what seemed to them 
a matter of great importance, namely, whether the communion 
elements should be taken up by the presiding minister, before 
what is called the consecration prayer. They were divided into 
two parties denominated the lifters and the non -lifters ; the latter 
contending that the elements should not be taken up in the hands 
of the minister, till he was about to distribute the bread and the 
wine set apart by prayer. The contention was so sharp, that Mr 
Smytane renounced his connection with the Synod. Part of the 
congregation adhered to him, but the majority who had left him, 
chose, after his death in 1789, the Rev. George Paxton to be 
their pastor, — a man of worth and of distinguished abilities ; who 
was elected in 1808 to be the Professor of Divinity in Edinburgh ; 
and who is well-known in all the churches by his excellent work,

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ROBERT FERGUSON, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

The parish of Fenwick anciently formed part of Kilmarnock. 
In 1642, it was disjoined from that parish, and was for some time 
known by the name of New- Kilmarnock. It appears to have de- 
rived its present name from Fenwick hill, in the neighbourhood 
of the church. The name is probably of Gaelic origin 

Extent and Boundaries. — The length of the parish is about 9

miles, its breadth upwards of 6. It is bounded on the east, by the 
parishes of Loudoun and Kilmarnock ; on the south, by Kilmar- 
nock ; on the west, by Stewarton ; and on the north, by Mearns 
and Eaglesham, 

Topographical Appearances.— T\iQ form of the parish some- 
what resembles that of an oblong square. From the south, the 
ascent is gradual northwards, till it attains an elevation of about 
700 feet, before reaching the point where it joins the Mearns 
moor. The lower part of the parish is occupied by cultiva- 
tors of the soil, and the produce is equal to that of the other 
districts in the neighbourhood. In the higher parts, the land is 
chiefly pastoral, and of excellent quality, the stock being equal to 
that of any land for many miles around, and, from the spirit of the 
farmers, it is daily improving. Of late years, the farmers in many 
parts of the parish have done much toward the improvement of 
their lands by draining. They have, in consequence, brought un- 
der cultivation large tracts of land, which formerly were no't mere- 
ly unproductive, but positively dangerous. In many instances, 
fields, across which, in a natural state, cattle could not with safety 
M-alk, are now yielding abundant crops. There is, however, a 
considerable portion of the soil entirely unproductive. In some 
of the farms, there are extensive mosses, which, at various seasons 
of the year, cannot be crossed by either man or beast, without the 
risk of life ; and one farmer lately told us, that there were at least 
100 acres in his farm which he would gladly want, as he found 
the moss frequently fatal to his sheep and cattle. These mosses 
are of great depth. 

Climate. — The climate is moist, and rains, owing, it may be, 
to the comparative proximity of the parish to the sea, are very pre- 
valent. There are no diseases peculiar to the parish ; and, from all 
I have been able to observe, the people enjoy as fair a share of 
health as any in the county. By the parliamentary census of the 
present year, there were in this parish twenty persons in a popu- 
lation of 2020, between eighty and ninety years of age. 

Rivers.- — There are only two streams in the parish : they rise 
in the north, and flow in a south by south-west direction towards 
the sea, which they enter at Irvine. 

Geology. — Limestone is found in the parish in abundance, and 
several quarries are worked with considerable advantage to the pro- 
prietors, and to the parishioners in general. Coal has, at differ-

ent periods, been met with, but till lately did not appear in such 
quantity as to promise an adequate remuneration for working it. 
It is proved, however, that the parish is abundantly supplied with 
coal. And it is to be hoped that the enterprise of the proprietor, 
the Marquis of Hastings, will be amply rewarded. On the same 
lands, iron has been found in great abundance, one bed measuring 
five feet in thickness. 

II. — Civil History. 
The history of Fenwick may be said to commence at the pe- 
riod of its disjunction from the parish of Kilmarnock in 1642. At 
that time, the parishioners seem to have been in a state of great 
ignorance, as may be seen from the following passage from the 
« Memoirs of the Rev. Mr Guthrie," its first pastor. " Most of 
his parishioners had hitherto been destitute of the common means 
of instruction, and of the ordinances of religion ; and it was only 
the glaring want of church accommodation and instruction in this 
neglected part of an old overgrown parish, that caused the forma- 
tion of the new parish of Fenwick. Mr Guthrie, in consequence, 
found them in a very low state of moral and mental improvement. 
Vice had grown up in all its wildness and deformity on the basis 
of ignorance. And the age and general features of that time gave 
a severity and harshness of expression to the manners of those who 
had enjoyed neither the softening influences of the Gospel, nor 
the bland impressions of high civilization. But, in proportion to 
the stubbornness of the soil, and the difficulty of breaking it up, 
were the efifects of his ardour and diligence conspicuous ; and the 
condition in which he found them, was a strong contrast to the ge- 
nuine piety and moral feeling which a few years of his labours in- 
troduced. He found them wandering without a guide, and sunk 
in all the consequences of a neglected education. He brought 
them into the great fold of the Gospel, and enlightened them by 
every means which his powerful and judicious management devis- 
ed, both in the pulpit and out of it. He found them heedless of 
the Sabbath ; — some loitering in the fields ; some gossiping in 
their neighbours' houses ; almost all spending it as a day of plea- 
sure, without considering the important blessings it brought to the 
improvement of their immortal souls. He soon gained their atten 
dance on all the ordinances of the Gospel, and their special ob- 
servance of keeping sacred the Lord's day. He found a sad lack 
of family devotion among them ; few families in his parish, in the 
course of his ministry, could be singled out as omitting this solemn 



'6 AVRSIIIUF. 



and improving exercise. And many were the instances of the 
careless sinner aroused and subdued by his preachino- ; and many 
he had the happiness of witnessing in their lives and°conversation, 
as the humble and devoted followers of that Saviour whom he un- 
ceasingly held forth to the acceptance of all. In short, the moral 
change wrought among them by his ministry, was a notable instance 
of the power of God accompanying the exertions of one of his 
choicest instruments." 

Eminent Men.—Thk parish was the birth-place or residence 
of several distinguished men, and among these the first place 
IS due to the Rev. Mr Guthrie. Descended from an ancient 
family m Angus-shire, the Guthries of Pitforthie, he was the 
eldest son of a numerous family, three of whom devoted themselves 
to the work of the Christian ministry. It would seem he had re- 
ceived an excellent education under the care of a pious mother, 
and that he studied under the celebrated Samuel Rutherford, then 
Professor of Divinity in St Andrews. About the age of twenty, 
he made over the estate of which he was heir to his brother, that 
he might have no worldly cares to withdraw him from his studies 
and the duties of the sacred office. At the early age of twenty- 
four, he was appointed to the pastoral charge of this°parish ; and 
such was the ardour of his piety, and the fame of his eloquence, 
that a considerable number of the regular attendants on his mi- 
nistry came from Glasgow, Hamilton, and Lanark. After he 
had been settled here twenty years, during which time he was 
too considerable a person to have escaped the jealous eye of the 
Government, he was at last ejected with all the rudeness of mili- 
tary despotism by the instrumentality of the Archbishop of Glas- 
gow. He survived this event little more than a twelvemonth. He 
was buried in the family vault of Pitforthy, in the cathedral of 
Brechin. 

Captain Paton, a distinguished officer among the Covenanters, 
was a native of this parish. He was born at Meadowhead, of 
which his fiither was farmer, and was himself employed in agri- 
culture till the age of manhood, when he went abroad, and en- 
gaged as a volunteer in the German wars. For his heroic con- 
duct at a siege, he was raised per solium to the rank of cap- 
tain. On his return to Scotland, his courage and military ex- 
perience gave him a prominent place in the transactions of his 
persecuted country. Of his prowess in battle many instances 
are recorded. He fought at the battle of Worcester, whero 



FENWICK. 



he distinguished himself by his heroism, and so deeply impres- 
sed General Dalzell with admiration of his courage, that long 
afterwards, when Paton had been condemned, he applied to the 
king for his pardon. At Bothwell, it is said he acted as colonel, 
though he did not retain the title. After the defeat of Bothwell, 
he was declared a rebel, and a price offered for his head. His 
escapes were numerous and romantic. He afforded shelter m his 
house at Meadowhead to several of the persecuted ministers ; and 
it is said, that Mr CargiU baptized at one time twenty-two children 
in his barn. He was at last taken at Floak, in the parish of 
Mearns. On his way to Kilmarnock, he was accidentally met by 
General Dalzell, who affectionately embraced him, and assured 
him that he would apply to the king for his pardon. The Gene- 
ral kept his word, and solicited and obtained the pardon ; but 
Bishop Paterson inhumanly detained the order till after the exe- 
cution. His Bible, which he handed to his wife on the scaffold, 
along with his sword, are still preserved as heir-looms among his 
descendants. The people of Fenwick, in gratitude for his services, 
have erected a tombstone to his memory. 

John Howie of Lochgoin deserves notice as the author of the 
Scots Worthies, a work of great interest. " His ancestors," we 
are informed by Mr M' Gavin, had occupied the same farm for 
ages ; and some of them suffered much in the persecuting period, 
particularly his great-grandf\ther, whose house was robbed and 
plundered twelve times ; but he always escaped with his life, and 
died in peace three years after the Revolution. John, the author of 
this work, died in 1793, aged fifty-seven." His descendants possess 
ample materials for an account of his life, and it is much to be desir- 
ed that the memory of a man, so devout and otherwise so meritori- 
ous, should be rescued from the comparative oblivion in which it 
is at present involved. The Howies of Lochgoin, though a hum- 
ble, are a very ancient family. They are supposed to have ori- 
ginally sprung from a family of Waldenses, who fled to Scotland 
in order to escape the persecution which, at the time, was raging 
in their own country. The period of their emigration cannot, per- 
haps, be distinctly ascertained. They selected one of the most 
inaccessible places in the whole country for their residence. The 
house is altogether inaccessible oh the east to horsemen, and an 
active man could not, even though acquainted with the locali- 
ty, at night cross the moss, by which it is defended, but at the 
risk of his life; and no stranger could venture across it with safety, 



778 



AYRSHIRE. 



even in day-Iight,without a guide. On the west, the only direction 
from which it can be approached, a sentinel was always stationed 
in times of danger, whence he could command an extensive view 
of the whole country as far as Ailsa Craig and the hills of Arran, 
and thus no body of troopers could reach the house, before the 
inmates had time to escape into the morasses. A situation like 
this was invaluable as a place of resort to the Covenanters, and it 
was the point to which the utmost vigilance and attention of the 
dragoons were naturally directed. Twelve times was the house 
plundered, and as often did the people escape. On such occasions, 
the money was removed and buried in the neighbouring mosses. 
It happened once, that they were nearly taken by surprise, and 
had only time to conceal the coin, without being able to mark the 
spot. In spite of all subsequent search, it remained in the moss 
for more than a century, when the place was accidentally discovered. 
After an extensive search, some scores of British and foreign coins 
were discovered. These are preserved by the family as very in- 
teresting relics. The Fenwick flag, which waved at Bothwell, 
Kilsyth, and Drumclog, is also preserved. 

In the churchyard of Fenwick there are two tombstones erect- 
ed, to point out the resting-place of individuals who, in the sacred 
cause of the covenant, sealed their faith with their blood.f 

• It is said that the late Edward Irving, who either was, or imagined himself to 
be. in some way related to the family, beheld this relic of a pious but persecuted 
people, -with an interest almost amounting to devotion. 

t The one of these stones bears the following inscription : — " Here lies the dust 
of John Fergusliill and George Woodburn, who were shot at Midland by Nisbetand 
his party, 1685." 

" When bloody prelates, once these nations' pest, 
Contrived that cursed self-contradicting lest, 
Ihese men for Christ did suffer martyrdom, 
And here their dust lies waiting till he come." 
The other is as follows : — " Here lies the body of James White, who was shot to 
death at Little Blackwood, by Peter Inglis and his party, 1685." 
" This martyr was by Peter Inglis shot, 
By birih a tyger rather than a Scot, 
Who that his monstrous extract might be seen, 
Cut off his head and kick't it o'er the green. 
Thus was that head which was to wear a crown, 
A football made by a profane dragoon." 
In a work popularly known by the name of the Fenwick Visions, the author of 
which was John Howie of Lochgoin, there are some singular narratives of visions of 
armies in battle array, &amp;c. seen in this parish immediately before the Rebellion of 
1745, and the late war with France. 

There is a tradition connected with a house in this parish which is worth record- 
ing. King's Well has long been known as the principal inn between Glasgow and Kil- 
marnock. It stands on one of the most elevated spots in the parish, and is flanked 
on the west by a deep flow- moss, over which a road has been formed within the last 
few years with extraordinary difficulty, the moss being in many parts so soft that a 
dog could not have walked across it without sinking. At some distance from King's 
Well, stood Pathelly Hall, a baronial residence of the Cochranes, at that time a place

III. — Population. 
The number of inhabitants in the parish, according to the pa- 
liamentary census of the present year, was 2020, giving an increase 
of only one over that of 1831. The population is very nearly 
equally divided between the village and country inhabitants. Dur- 
ing many years, there has been no register of deaths preserved, and 
only a partial one of births ; and on this account, it is impossible to 
state the average number in either case. 

IV. — Parochial Economy. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was built in 1643. Its 
external appearance is antiquated, but the interior is neat and com- 
modious. Among other objects of interest belonging to it, the 
oaken pulpit from which Mr Guthrie preached, and which is still 
used, is the most conspicuous. The church affords accommoda- 
tion for 700 or 800 people. The sittings are all free. 

The nianse is a large but uncomfortable and unhealthy house. 
It was built in 1783; repaired and enlarged about twelve years 
ago. 

The glebe comprises about eight acres of good land. Its yearly 
value may be L. 24. The stipend is L. 150 per annum, a small 
portion of which is derived from the Exchequer. 

There is one Dissenting chapel in the parish in connection with 

of some importance, but of which there is now hardly a vestige. Hither one of the 
Jameses was proceeding to administer justice on occasion of some feud or foray, of 
which the details have not been preserved. The affliir was sufficiently serious lo oc- 
casion no slight apprehensions on the part of those who had the misfortune to be im- 
plicated, and the approach of the monarch awakened many conflicting emotions of 
hope and fear. After a long ride over very difficult ground, and in one of the high- 
est and most exposed districts in Scotland, his Majesty had at last acquired an appe- 
tite too sharp to be compatible with comfort. He was obliged therefore to alight at 
the nearest house, which happened to be a peasant's cottage. The gudewife supplied 
him with very homely cheer ; but luxury was then in a great measure unknown, and 
a king would have been contemptible who could not rough it with the hardiest of his 
subjects. After a hearty meal, he was proceeding to depart, when the good woman 
told him that her husband was one of the prisoners whose trial had been the main 
object of his journey, and that he surely never would have the heart to hang a man 
after having eat his breakfast sitting in his arm-chair. This appeal the rules of hos- 
pitality rendered irresistible. When he reached Pathelly Hall, he singled out the 
husband of his hostess, lectured him on the impropriety of his conduct, and dismis- 
sed him with an admonition to be a better bairn. He next commenced his inves- 
tigation, and finding eighteen of the prisoners guilty, hung them up forthwith on a 
hawthorn, which is still pointed out, and displays obvious marks of great antiquity. 
On his way to Pathelly Hall, his horse drunk at the spot where King's Well now 
stands, and shortly afterwards sunk in a quagmire, which is still called the King's 
Stable. His majesty long remembered the ride, of which he used often to detail the 
particulars, and the Ayrshire roads were represented as impassable. 

• In the church the sand-glass is still employed, and is used thus : When the 
preacher has announced the text from which he is to preach, the precentor brings 
forth from a small box a half-hour sand-glass, which he places on an iron stand. 
When the glass has run out, he removes it, and the preacher after that, only adds 
what he finds necessary.

the United Secession. Dissent in Fenwick dates its onVin from 
1782, at which period an individual was intruded into tlie parish 
in opposition to the repeated petitions and remonstrances of a 
united population. The question of that individual's settlement 
was long litigated in the ecclesiastical courts. His ordination and 
induction, however, were at length ordered by the General As- 
sembly. When the period for carrying this order into effect ar- 
rived, the Presbytery of Irvine, knowing well the opposition which 
they were likely to encounter, proceeded to ordain the unacceptable 
ininister,|not in, the parish in which he was to labour, but in the 
usual place of meeting in the burgh of Irvine. The people of 
Fenwick, however, were still anxious to remain within the pale of 
the Established Church, and for this purpose they solicited the 
sanction of the presbytery to the erection of a chapel of ease, where 
they might enjoy the ministrations of a pastor selected by them- 
selves. ■. But those who had been the instruments of intrud- 
ing an unacceptable minister into the pulpit once filled by the il- 
lustrious Guthrie, were not likely to lend a favourable ear to such 
a petition. The prayer of the petition was accordingly refused, 
and a very large dissent was the consequence. The few families, 
and they were very few, who remained in communion with the Es- 
tablished Church, became regular attendants in neighbouring pa- 
rishes. The vast majority united, erected a place of worship in 
connection with the class of seceders called Burghers. The dis- 
sent thus begun, many circumstances combined to continue. The 
incumbency of the intruded minister was a long one, extending to 
forty- seven years. During his ministry, he was not successful in 
recalling any of those whom his induction had driven from the 
church of their fathers. Many families, however, who, during his 
incumbency, became resident in the parish, not being formerly 
Dissenters, and not being influenced by those feelings to which 
his induction gave birth, continued in communion with the church, 
and became members of his congregation. In this way, a respec- 
table congregation had been formed at the period of his death. 
The settlement which followed was scarcely more favourable for 
the interests of the Established Church. Dissent began afresh, 
and proceeded to such an extent, that in 1836, when the present 
incumbent was settled, he found only one-third of the population 
belonging to the Establishment. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is five, of 
which two are parochial and endowed ; the others are on the

teachers' own adventure. The state of division existing in the pa- 
rish in ecclesiastical affairs extends its influence even to matters of 
education, so that not only is the adult population separated in 
their places of worship, but their children resort to difi'erent schools. 
Of the two parochial teachers, one enjoys an endowment of L. 27, 
the other of L. 10 per annum.

THE REV. JAMES INGLIS, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish takes its name from Oswald, a Northum- 
brian king of the Heptarchy, who built a church on the site of the 
burying- ground beside the village — in gratitude, it is said, for a 
victory he had there obtained. 

Situation, Erection, Extent c. — The parish is situate in that 
district of Ayrshire called Carrick. Prior to 1652, it was of con- 
siderably larger extent than at present. At that time, the pa- 
rish of Barr was disjoined from Girvan, Dailly, and Colmonell 
The sea-coast of the parish from north to south is six English 
miles in extent; the greater part of which is a sandy beach, with 
a beautiful and rich carpet of grass, to the very sea-mark. From 
every part of this coast, there is a beautiful prospect of the Frith 
of Clyde, land-locked, as it were, on all sides, by the coast of 
Cunningham, island of Bute, island of Arran, Kintyre, the coast 
of Ireland, and the Ayrshire coast. What adds to the beauty and 
grandeur of the prospect, is the noble rock of Ailsa, in the middle 
of the Frith. 

Surface, Soil, c. — The surface is hilly ; but the hills, except in 
two places, called Mochrum and Craigdow, never rise to any con- 
siderable height. Near Mochrum, there is a loch which covers 
twenty-four Scots acres, and another, apparently as large, near 
Craigdow. From these lochs, and from numberless springs 
which rise out of every hill, flow many small streams, which wander

through the parish, and afford abundance of pure water. Except 
the very tops of Mochruni and Craigdow, and several tracts of moss, 
the whole parish is arable. ' 

There is little or no natural wood in the parish. But the want 
of this is happily supplied by the plantations made by the Earl of 
Cassillis and Sir Charles Fergusson of Kilkerran. 

11. — Civil History. 
Antiquities. — Upon a small promontory on the barony of Turn- 
berry, now the property of the Earl of Cassillis, are the ruins of 
the famous castle of Turnberry, the seat of the Earls of Carrick. 
When or by whom it was built is altogether uncertain. Authen- 
tic history, however, informs us, that in 1724, Martha, Countess 
of Carrick, lived in this her castle, and was that year married to 
Robert Bruce, Earl of Annandale. From this marriage sprung 
the kings of Scotland, of the race of Stewart. In 1306, Turn- 
berry was held by an English garrison, under Earl Percy ; and 
some years after this, we find that King Robert Bruce stormed the 
castle, still in possession of the English, routed and expelled the 
garrison, but at the expense of the destruction of the building. Af- 
ter this, we do not hear of its being inhabited. 

The next remarkable old building in the parish, is the Ab- 
bey of Crossraguel, founded by Duncan, King of Scotland, in 
1260, situated two miles east from the village. It is more entire 
than any abbey in the west of Scotland. The side walls of 
the church and choir still remain to the height of fourteen feet. 
It has been exceedingly well lighted within. Towards the east, 
remains the niche where the principal altar stood. On the right 
of this is the vestry, and the Abbot's ecclesiastical court, all en- 
tire, and arched very much in the style of the cathedral at Glas- 
gow. There are besides, several vaults and cells, all built of fine 
hewn-stone. At the east end of the abbey, stand the ruins of 
the Abbot's first house. On the west end of the abbey, stands 
the last house which the Abbot inhabited. The whole building 
stands in the middle of eight acres of ground, commonly called the 
Abbot's yard, or precinct of Crossraguel. This ruin is preserved 
with great care and attention. 

The next old building in the parish, is the house or castle of 
Thomaston, about half a-mile to the south-east of Culzean. Tra- 
dition tells us, that this was built by a nephew of Robert Bruce, in 
the year 13.35, It has been exceedingly strong, and of very consi-

derable extent. It was inhabited fifty years ago, and is now the 
property of the Earl of CassilUs. 

Of the more modern buildings in this parish, the most remark- 
able is Culzean castle, founded by David, late Earl of Cassillis, in 
the year 1777. This noble edifice is situated upon a rock, project- 
ing a little into the sea, of about 100 feet in height from the sur- 
face of the water, and almost perpendicular. The style of the ar- 
chitecture, and the execution of the work, are singularly elegant. 
At a proper distance from the castle, stand the stables and farm- 
houses. The castle commands a delightful prospect of the whole 
Frith of Clyde, with a full view of the rock of Ailsa. On the land 
side, and immediately below the castle, -are the gardens belong- 
ing to the old house of Culzean, formed out of rock, at a great ex- 
pense, into three terraces ; upon the walls of which are planted 
some of the rarest and most delicate shrubs and trees, seldom 
found growing in the open air The remainder of the old gardens 
is formed into pleasure-ground and gravel walks, kept with great 
care. Round the castle, and the adjoining buildings, lies an ex- 
tensive policy of about 700 acres, interspersed with many thriving 
plantations. 

Near to the castle, and immediately under some of the build- 
ings, are the coves or caves of Culzean. These are six in num- 
ber. Of the three towards the west, the largest has its entry as 
low as high-water mark ; the roof is about 50 feet high ; it ex- 
tends inwards about 200 feet, and varies in breadth. It commu- 
nicates with the other two, which are both considerably less, but 
of much the same irregular form. Towards the east, are the other 
three coves, which likewise communicate with each other. They 
are nearly of the same height and figure with the former ; but 
their extent has not been precisely ascertained. Old Stat. Account. 

In the interior of the parish, there are very distinct remains of 
a Druidical circle. Stone-coffins have been dug up, and found to 
contain curious ornaments, some of which are in the possession of 
the minister of the parish. Some years ago, a very curious spear 
was discovered in a moss. On the shore, there is a vitrified fort 
which will reward the curiosity of the visitor. 

This parish is a good deal connected with the Life and works of 
the poet Burns. In the summer of 1788, he attended school in 
the village of Kirkoswald, where he seems to have been placed in 
consequence of his mother's connection with the parish, she being 
the daughter of Gilbert Brown, tenant in Craigcnton. While re-

siding at Ballochneil, in this neighbourhood of the villao-e, he was 
not far distant from the farm of Shanter, then occupied by some 
of the characters whom he afterwards introduced into his tale of 
Tam o' Shanter. The hero of the tale was Douglas Graham, de- 
signed on his tombstone in the churchyard beside the village, by 
his fictitious name.

Manufactures. — The only manufacture in this parish is of tiles; 
for which purpose there are three works, which produce about 
1,000,000 yearly, sufficient to drain upwards of 300 Scotch 
acres annually. Part of the tiles, however, are carried out of the 
parish.

A few cotton weavers, scattered over the parish, are supplied 
with webs from Maybole and Girvan and Glasgow ; also a number 
of females are supplied with flowering webs from the same quarters. 

Agriculture. — About a fourth less wheat is sown now than was 
done a few years ago ; although along the coast, the quantity is 
still kept up, and of as good quality as any in the west country. 
The land is generally very well cultivated. A few beans are 
grown on two or three farms, well adapted for them, and may oc- 
cupy about fifty or sixty acres yearly. Oats are grown of first 
quality all over the parish ; little or no bear or barley. There are 
a great many dairies of first quality, the produce principally made 
into cheese, and generally sold for the Glasgow market. The 
produce of the cows is generally estimated at from L. 7 to L. 10 
each, according to the pasture and management ; and in a few 
places it goes considerably beyond the latter sum. The chief 
markets for the parish are at Ayr and Girvan ; and immense quanti- 
ties of potatoes are annually shipped at the latter port, some of 
the farmers sending off 200 or 300 tons ; as also wheat, oatmeal, 
&amp;c. &amp;c. Draining is going on with great spirit ; it is only five or 
six years since the first tile-work was begun ; there are about forty 
men and boys engaged all summer, five or six horses, and a foreman 
to manage each : a number of both cattle and sheep are fed on 
turnips for the Ayr and Glasgow markets. 

Coal. — The quantity of coal put out yearly at Dulzellowlie coal- 
work is about 60,000 creels or 1000 tons of 20 cwts. each, the average 
value of which may be about L. 1750. The number of persons em- 
ployed is generally about thirty. It is understood that, about one 
hundred years ago, the coal there took fire by accident : but 
there has been no appearance of active fire, for the last thirty years ; 
and the working is now going on in the place where fire was last 
supposed to be, which proves it to be quite extinguished. The seams 
of coal are five in number, varying from 5 to 18 feet in thickness. 
Above 30 fathoms below the surface are working at present. The 
dip and rise of the coal-field is about a foot in three and a-half. 

Fishings. — Fishings of salmon, white-fish, and herrings are car- 
ried on in the parish to a considerable extent. Value about 
L.360 per annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
Ecclesiastical State. — The whole population, with the excep- 
tion of five or six Dissenting families, belongs to the Established 
Church. The stipend, by a recent augmentation, amounts to 17

chalders; the glebe is 4 J imperial acres in extent. The manse 
was built in 1771, and is in a good habitable condition. 

Education. — There are six schools in the parish, including one 
female school kept in the village of Kirkoswald. Salary of the 
parochial schoolmaster, L. 30 ; average yearly amount of school 
fees, L. 45. The Kilkerran family has endowed one of the 
schools with accommodations, and a salary of L. 12 per annum 
to the teacher. 

Poor. — The average number of poor is 46; and the aver- 
age allowance to each Is. per week. The heritors contribute 
for their behoof about L. 110 per annum ; and about L. 40 per 
annum is derived from church collections.

PRESBYTERY OF GREENOCK, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JOHN DOW, MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — The learned author of Caledonia says that the name of 
this parish is derived from the Scoto-Irish /.eflr, signifying ajsZaw, 
and that the same word appears in various other names of places in 
North Britain. The final s, the sign of the English plural, has been 
added in consequence of two places bearing the same name. 
This derivation is not, like the generality of Celtic names, very 
accurately descriptive, for there is no extent of ground in the pa- 
rish which can be called a plain. Some have supposed that the 
word also signifies fields, and that, as it was the field or scene of 
the celebrated battle with the Norwegians, the place has conse- 
quently been called the Largs. This is, however, purely fanci- 
ful, and is not consistent with fact, for the place bore the name of 
Largs long prior to the event alluded to. 

Boundaries and Extent. — The town of Largs lies in latitude 
55° 49' 30" north, longitude 4° 52' west. The parish contains about 
37f square miles, or 24,160 acres. It lies along the coast of the 
Frith of Clyde for nine miles. On the north it is bounded by 
• Furnished by James Dobie, Esq. Beith. 



LAllGS. 



787 



the parishes of Innerkip and Greenock; on the east, by Kihual- 
colm, Lochwinnoch, and Kilbirnie; on the south, by Dairy and 
West Kilbride; and on the west, by the Frith of Clyde. Its 
breadth is not much more than four miles. 

Topographical Appearances. — We cannot give a better or more 
accurate general account than that which is to be found in the se- 
cond Statistical Account of this parish in the former work, Vol. 
xvii. p. 503. " No parish in the west of Scotland, and few in the 
Highlands, can afford such a variety of beautiful and romantic 
scenes. The hills, which begin to rise in the neighbouring pa- 
rishes of Greenock, Kilmalcolm, Lochwinnoch, Kilbirnie, and 
Dairy, meet in a kind of general summit at the eastern boundary 
of Largs, from which they gradually descend as they approach the 
shore, till they terminate at last in a variety of abrupt declivities, 
some of which are almost perpendicular, as if part of their base 
had been torn away by force. Notwithstanding the vast height of 
these hilis, they are covered during the greater part of the year 
with verdure, and afford such excellent pasture for sheep, and 
some of them for larger cattle, as can hardly be found elsewhere 
in similar situations. 

" The quantity of heath, even on the highest hills, is compara- 
tively small ; and, from indisputable marks, it appears that some 
of them have once been cultivated." 

Along the coast from West Kilbride to Kellyburn, there is a 
tract of rich land, the mean breadth of which is about a quarter of 
a mile. The tract narrows towards the north. To the east the 
ground rises abruptly to a very great height. The hill of Stake, 
which is the extreme boundary on the east, is 1691 feet above the 
level of the sea ; and to the south of that mountain Irishlaw 
stands 1576, and Knockside hill, 1419 feet above the same level. 
The half of the whole land in the parish is hill pasture, and oc- 
cupied as such. The temperature of the town of Largs, which is 
protected from the east winds by a range of high ground, is consi- 
dered mild and salubrious; and the situation has become a favourite 
and fashionable watering-place. The high grounds above Largs 
afford very delightful prospects. The admirers of nature need not 
travel out of this district in search of fine scenery, as few scenes can 
equal in rich variety what the enraptured eye of the beholder can 
witness from th e grounds above Kelburn. There may be enjoyed

Climate and Diseases.  — The quantity of rain which falls at 
Largs has never been ascertained, but there is no doubt that it is 
considerable. A rain-gauge was kept for some time at the Bris- 
bane Observatory, two miles from Largs, from which it appeared 
that the quantity which fell at Brisbane was very great. There 
is reason to believe, however, from the situation of the observatory, 
that showers frequently fall there, which do not reach the plain of 
Largs. The town of Largs is pretty much exposed to wind from 
all points, but it suffers only from the east and north-west. The 
former comes down the Brisbane and Gogo glens, frequently with 
great violence, yet it is not found that these winds produce those 
pernicious effects on the health which are ascribed to them on the 
east coast of Scotland, the wind being dry and clear. Largs is, 
generally speaking, a very healthy place, the mortality in ordinary 
years varying from I in 50, to 1 in 65 of the whole population, 
exclusive of strangers. To this rule there have been some excep- 
tions. In 1828, an epidemic dysentery prevailed throughout the 
whole of the west of Scotland, and added ten or twelve to our bill 
of mortality for that year ; and also in 1836 and 1837, an 
epidemic erysipelas, of a peculiarly intractable character, prevail- 
ed, and proved fatal in a considerable number of cases. In 1832, 
cholera appeared in three houses ; the number of deaths was five. 
To two of the houses it was brought by persons arriving from 
Glasgow, in the third instance it appeared spontaneously. In no 
case did it spread to the neighbouring houses. Typhus fever ap- 
pears in Largs occasionally, seldom spreading to any great extent, 
and for the most part confined to the poorer and worst lodged part 
of our population. Poverty, filth, and intemperance, will produce 
their usual effects on the physical and moral health in the healthi- 
est locality. The writer has long been impressed with the neces- 
sity of having a separate building for the reception and treatment 
of contagious diseases in Largs, and in all considerable towns and 
villages, where the patients would enjoy the benefit of thorough 
cleanliness and ventilation, and where the sick would be separat- 
ed from the healthy. In this way, he thinks, many valuable lives 
might be saved, and much misery prevented. 

The agricultural portion of the inhabitants are remarkably

healthy. Those who reside in the town being generally weavers, 
and the females chiefly engaged in sewing muslin, and other se- 
dentary employments, are liable to the complaints and deteriora- 
tion of health incident to such occupations. These are, however, 
partly counteracted by cultivating patches of potato ground, sail- 
ing, fishing, &amp;c. in which many of them occasionally engage. 

Largs has long been in high repute as a watering-place. From 
the end of May till the middle of October, there is an additional 
population, varying from 300 or 400 to upwards of 1000. Few 
places afford greater facilities for sea-bathing, it being easily prac- 
ticable to bathe at all times of the tide, and to obtain a proper 
depth by wading a few yards. The whole coast is perfectly safe. 
The sea-breezes are of a peculiarly bracing and invigorating charac- 
ter, and their salutary effects evident on crowds of annual visitors 
from the densely peopled towns of the interior. Although showers 
often fall, the whole plain on which Largs stands is singularly dry, 
from the pure gravel which forms the subsoil speedily absorbing 
the water, and rendering our roads and walks dry and pleasant a 
few hours after the heaviest rain, 

From the keenness of the easterly winds in winter and spring, 
it may be doubted whether the climate of LargS is well adapted 
for patients liable to spitting of blood, or inflammatory affections 
of the lungs. In such cases, Rothsay is preferable. Yet phthisis 
is not a disease of frequent occurrence in Largs, the deaths from it 
seldom exceeding three or four annually. In some consumptive 
cases, when there is little tendency to inflammation or hemorrhage, 
the writer of this has seen decided amendment from a residence 
in Largs. Croup in some seasons has prevailed to some extent ; but 
for several years past, it has been of rare occurrence. 

No instance of wonderful longevity exists at present in the pa- 
rish, but the number of persons betwixt the ages of seventy and 
ninety-three is very considerable. 

Hydrography. — There are only two rivers in the parish which 
call for notice, the Gogo and the Noddle. The former rises in 
the south-east part of the parish, and falls into the sea at the town 
of Largs. The word is said to be Celtic, and signifies a branching 
river. It has accordingly various branches and tributaries, and its 
water is considerably augmented .by that of the Greeto, which 
joins it about the middle of its course. The Noddle takes its 
rise in the north-east of the parish, and, after winding its way 
through the vale of Brisbane, falls into the sea about half a mile 



790 



AYRSHIRE. 



to the iiortli of Gogo. Both of these rivers are noticed by Pont. 
Of the former he says, " Gogo fluvius, a small river running bv 
the church of the Largs," and of the other he merely says, " Nodle 
fluvius." 

The water of Rye takes its origin in this parish, near the source 
ot the Gogo, but runs to the south through the parish of Dairy, 
and joms the Garnock at Ryesholm. A small streamlet runs to 
the west through the grounds at Kelburn, from which it takes its 
natiie, and on the south boundary of the parish another stream, 
called Fairlyburn, rises in the high grounds, and runs for about a 
mile, when it joins its waters to the Frith of Clyde, forming the 
boundary of the parishes of Largs and West Kilbride. To the 
north of Fairly, is a small stream called Kepping burn. 

The north-east of the parish is bounded by Routenburn, which 
rises at the Hill of Stake, and runs to the north. It is called by 
•Pont " Rottin burne." Some fanciful etymologists have derived 
Its name from the routing or defeating of the Danes, as if it had 
been written rout- Dane burn, but this is not deserving of any seri- 
ous consideration. It is obvious that the name is descriptive of 
the noise which the water makes, when roaring through its rocky 
bed, especially after heavy rains. The northern boundary of the 
parish is Kellyburn, which takes its rise in what was of old called 
" the Forret of Kyith, " and which was latterly called " the back 
of the vt'orld. " It runs for near two miles, and falls into the sea 
at Kelly bridge, to the north of the grounds of Skelmorlie. 

There was formerly a small island opposite the harbour of Fair- 
lie. It is laid down in Bleau's map of Cunninghame ; but, owing 
to the receding of the water, the island is no more visible. At low 
water, there is a large extent of the channel laid bare between 
Fairlie and Hunterstone, and it has been thought that this land 
, could, by a strong embankment, be entirely gained from the sea ; 
but, as this would not be a productive enterprise to the undertak- 
ers, it is not likely to be attempted. 

Geology. — The geology of this parish is not interesting. The 
lowest rock, visible in situ, is old red sandstone, or old red sand- 
stone conglomerate, visible about Quarter on the one hand, and 
Fairly on the other. Upon this old red sandstone, or sandstone 
conglomerate, is superimposed secondary trap, which forms the 
summit of the highest hills towards the sources of the Greeto, the

Gogo, and the Noddle. The old-red sandstone, in no instance, 
rises in this parish to nearly the elevation of the sources of these 
streams. The bed of secondary trap, here alluded to, may be 
traced from the German Ocean, throughout Scotland, to the island 
of Little Curabrae, Arran, &amp;c. In Little Cumbrae it is distinctly 
stratified, as may be seen from our side of the Frith, with an in- 
clination of about 10° to the west or south-west. The same stra- 
tification of trap, on the large scale, may be seen on the Clyde 
near Kilpatrick. Near Quarter, in this parish, is a small mmia- 
ture coal-field, but not conformable, inserted in the old red sand- 
stone. This field is exposed on the beach. It consists of lime- 
stone and shale. The old red sandstone is here and there cut by 
dikes of greenstone, which pass into the superincumbent trap. 
Their direction is most frequently from north to south, or from 
north-west to south-east. But to this there are exceptions, as at 
Fairly Brae, &amp;c. Few, if any, organic remains have as yet been 
discovered in the old red sandstone, and none in the trap. The 
other formations in the parish are either diluvium or alluvium. 
The higher parts of the Noddle may be given as a locality for the 
first. The site of Largs itself for the second. The first is no- 
where distinguished for fertility, but the second forms very fertile 
land; while the soil, mostly formed from the disintegration of old 
red sandstone, is generally very barren. 

Coals have been looked for in the parish ; hitherto without suc- 
cess. The basis of our rocks are under the coal formation, pro- 
perly so called, and the superimposed trap only forms the rough 
basin in or on which the coal formation rests. 

One of the most interesting geological phenomenon to be ob- 
served in this parish, is the subsidence of the water of the Frith, 
or the elevation of the land. The one or other has been the case. 
The clifts near Quarter leave no doubt on this subject, as an in- 
spection of them will testify. A line of old beach rock, forty feet 
above the present high- water mark, shows that we must come to 
the one or other conclusion. The hill on Gogo, too, which marks 
one of the points of a meridian line, leads nearly to the same con- 
clusion, having most probably been deposited in still water by the 
stream when it was at least a quarter of a mile shorter, or, in other 
words, when the Clyde washed the base of the trap rocks near this 
place.,. Others may settle this point; but the matter referred to 
is well deserving examination.

Concholocjij.— There is at Largs a post-tertiary deposit, rich in 
subfossil shells, which the Misses Muir of Warriston have ex- 
plored with great zeal. The number of species already found in 
it though it was but lately discovered by Mr Landsborough of Ste- 
venston, amounts to sixty-eight. These are all scientifically ar- 
ranged, and, with a few exceptions, named, in the cabinet of the 
Misses Muir. Some of the rarest were sent to London to James 
Smith, Esq. of Jordanhill, who is very distinguished in this de- 
partment of science ; and he and other metropolitan geologists and 
conchologists say, that two of them are new— hitherto unknown. 
They are Rissoae, one of them resembling the Rissoa Harveyii of 
W. Thompson, Belfast. The whole list would occupy too much

II. — Civil History. 
It appears that Cunninghame was anciently formed of two dis- 
tinct territories. The southern and larger one was called Cun- 
ninghame, and the northern and smaller one was called Largs. 
King Malcolm IV. created Sir Richard Morville Great Constable 
of Scotland, and Lord of Cunninghame, Largs, and Lauderdale. 



794 



AYRSHIRE. 



The title and dignities of the De Morvilles passed in 1 196, bv a 
female heir, to Roland, Lord of Galloway. On the death of Al- 
lan, Lord of Galloway, in 1234, the Lordship of Largs was inhe- 
rited by his daughter Dervorgill, who married John de Baliol, the 
father of John, the competitor for the Crown. She survived her hus- 
band, and during her widowhood granted t6 Robert, Bishop of 
Glasgow, the lands and pasture of Cunninghame, and the lands 
and pasture of Rysdale, with the pertinents, and twenty-four acres 
of land, which were commonly called Balolfslands, in her lordship 
of Largs, and a bovat of land, with the pertinents, in her tene- 
ment of Largs. This grant was confirmed by Alexander IlL 

The most remarkable circumstance in the history of this place 
is its having been the sceae of the battle between the Norwegians 
and the Scots, which took place on 3d October 1263. It is fo- 
reign to the object of this work to enter into the details of this 
conflict, nor is it now necessary, after the plain and authentic nar- 
rative given by Tytler in the first volume of his interesting and 
most valuable history. It is there cleared from all the exaggera- 
tions of the early historians and chroniclers. Instead of the 24,000 
Danes and 5000 Scotch which, according to Boece, were slain at 
this battle, it appears that the whole force of the Norwegians that 
landed did not consist of more than 900, and that the Scotch 
army consisted of 1500. These were chiefly troops collected bv 
the neighbouring barons, whose possessions were in more imme- 
diate danger of devastation from the enemy. The Scotch army is 
said to have been composed of the chief men of the west, yet it is 
singular that not one of the leaders should have had his name re- 
corded and sent down to posterity, but Peter de Currie, who bold- 
ly riding up, challenged the Norwegians to single combat, and was 
immediately killed by Nicolson, a Norwegian chief. The discom- 
fiture of the Norwegians was aided by the inclemency of the wea- 
ther, which King Haco attributed to witchcraft, and for the ap- 
peasing of which he had mass celebrated at Cumbray. The Nor- 
wegians seem to have fought with great bravery, and on the second 
day had put the Scotch to flight. They were afraid, however, of 
the arrival of fresh troops and renewed vigour, and betook them- 
selves to their ships and boats, leaving the shore strewed with their 
dead, and with the wreck of their proud armament. King Haco 
died at Kirkwall, on his return to Norway. All subsequent con-

tentions between liis people and the Scotch were terminated soon 
after by the marriage of one of Alexander's daughters to Eric, the 
son and successor of Haco. 

An ingenious paper was drawn up on the subject of this battle 
and its localities, by the late John Dillon, Esq. a man of high ta- 
lent for research, and to whom the country is indebted for labours 
which have not been appreciated as they ought. It is published 
in the seventh volume of the Transactions of the Society of Scotch 
Antiquaries. He shows with plausibility that the landing of the 
Norwegians must have taken place between the south end of Bris • 
bane Crescent and Fairlie burn, and that the conflict took place 
immediately below Haylee. We refer those who are desirous of 
studying the minutiae of this enterprize to Mr Dillon's paper, and 
to Mr Tytler's History. 

On the death of Dervorgill, the lordship of Largs fell to her 
son John Baliol, who forfeited the same upon the accession of 
Bruce, who conferred this Lordship on his son-in-law, Walter, the 
steward of Scotland. Largs and Cunninghame continued sepa- 
rate districts, and are mentioned as distinct baronies in the charter 
of Robert H., settling the privileges of the burgh of Irvine, 8th 
April 1372. To this charter Hugo de Eglynton is a witness. 
It was during this reign that these baronies were placed under the 
charge of one bailie, and were subsequently called the BaiHary of 
Cunninghame, which has since formed the northern division of 
Ayrshire. The barony of Largs was afterwards parcelled out 
among the vassals of the Stewarts. The church and parish of 
Largs formed a rectory, the patronage of which belonged to the 

lordship of Largs. 

On the 30th of January 1318-19, Walter the Stewart, for the 
safety of his own soul and that of his late spouse, Marjory Bruce, 
granted the church of Largs in pure and perpetual alms to the 
Monastery of Paisley. The village of Largs was formed in the 
immediate vicinity of the church, and soon increased in population. 

In the reign of James I., a dispute arose between the Abbot of 
Paisley and Robert Boyd of Tinwald, who laid claim to the fruits 
of the church of Largs. The following letter passed under the 
privy-seal on this occasion, and proved the means of settling the 
dispute; " James, be the grace of- God, Kyng of Scottis, till our 
lovid Robert Boid of Tynwald gretynge : Foralsmekill as we are

Nothing remarkable occurs in the history of the place until 
1647, when it was visited by the plague, under which it suffered 
very severely. Its appearance there is first noticed in the records 
of the Presbytery of Irvine, under date '29th June 1647, when 
" the referres of Largs were continued because of the sickness 
there ;" and, on the 17th of August, this sickness is said to be the 
plague. The minister was carried off by this disease ; and the 
state of the parish is thus noticed at the meeting of the 28th of 
September: " The Presbiterie, laying to heart" the lamentable 
and calamitous condition of the paroch of Largs, partly by reason 
of the hand of God that is lying heavy upon them, and partly by 
reason of the removal of their minister by death, thinks it expe- 
dient that Mr Wm. Lindsay be sent to visit them, and to take no- 
tice of their desires, and to enquire ane overture of themselves how 
they may be gotten helpit and supplied ; and the said Mr Wm. to 
make report of his diligence." On the 26th of October, the mi- 
nutes of Presbytery bear, « The laird of Bishopton having remon- 
strate the calamitous condition of the paroch of Largs, and the 
present necessity that the town of Largs was in, and that if it were 
not tymouslie removit and helpit, the people wald be forcit to break 
out athort the countrie. The Presbiterie, after hearing, ordains 
that these bretheren of the Presbiterie, who, upon the report of 
their present necessity, had already gathered something for supply 
of the same, should presentlie apply themselves for their relief, 
either in money or in victuall, as suld be thought most expedient, 
and that the rest of the bretheren sould use all possible diligence 
in collecting a contribution to be sent to them to refresh them in 
their necessity." 

The aid of the neighbouring parishes being called for, it ap- 
peared that the following sums had been contributed for relief of 
the calamity at Largs : — " From Newmylnes, L.vij lib. viijj. 
iiijd.; from Irvin, 200 merkes; from Kilmaurs, 1 hundrith two 



LAWGS. 



797 



merks from Stewavtoune, 1 hundrith eleven punds ; from Kil- 
winning, 1 liundrith pound ; from Perston, 40lb. viij merkes." 

Other assistance was procured, and the distress of the people 
alleviated ; but the effect of this visitation was felt for a consider- 
able period. 

The population of the parish, at the date of this calamity, seems 
to have been greater than what it is now, as the number of com- 
municants is stated to have been 2000. The population decreased 
considerably. Besides those who were carried oflF, the alarm and 
excitement must have caused many families to leave the place ; 
and it was not until a comparatively recent period, that the tide of 
popular favour turned, and caused a gradual increase until the pre- 
sent day. Yet even now, with all the advantages, the resident 
number of communicants is not near the amount it had attained 
previous to the devastation. 

There was a proposal to remove the church from the village to 
the south part of the parish, and, as the proceedings to accomplish 
this are not uninteresting, an abstract of them is lodged along with 
the MS. of this Account. 

The record proceeds, on 1st November 1649, to state, " con- 
cerning the accomodation of the Largs, which is a wyd and spati- 
ous congregation, the perambulators did judge it expedient that 
the lands of Southanan, belonging to my Lord Semple, the lands of 
Corsbie, belonging to Auchinnames, sould be annexitto Kilbryde, 
because of their neirness to that kirk and farness from their own ; 
Idly,, Because of the impossibilitie of building a new kirk within 
that paroch, be reason of the desolation of these partes ; and, Qdly, 
Because of ane impassable water betwixt them and Largs." 

The annexation of these lands look place ; but the idea of trans- 
porting the kirk to the south of the impassable river Gogo was 
given up, and, a few years ago, a chapel, in connection with the 
Establishment, was built at Fairlie, near the place where it had 
been contemplated to erect the parish church. The difficulties 
of passing rivers no longer exist, — substantial bridges being now 
erected over every stream which crosses the highway. The bridge 
over the troublesome Gogo was carried away by a heavy flood in 
1831 ; but a large and commodious one was speedily erected, and 
is likely to resist the power of the river for a long series of years.

Ancient Families.— Fairlie of that Ilk.— On the south of the 
parish lies the ancient barony of Bairlie, which belonged for up- 
wards of 400 years to a ftimily of that name. In 1335, William 
de Fairlie is included in the list of twenty Scotchmen who receiv- 
ed letters of pardon from Edward III. for all the crimes they had 
committed in war with England, Rot. Scot. Vol. i. p. 381. The 
family continued in possession of the estate until the beginning of 
the eighteenth century, when it was sold to David, Earl of Glas- 
gow, with whose descendants it still remains. The castle or square 
tower is now in ruins. It is noticed by Pont in the following man- 
ner: " Fairlie Castell is a stronge toure, and very ancient, beau- 
tified with orchardes and gardins. It belongs to Fairlie de eodem, 
cheiffe of th'er name." 

Bot/le of Kelburn. — Richard Boyle, Dominus de Kaulburn, is 
mentioned in a transaction with Walter Cumyn, in the reign of 
Alexander III.; and Robert de Boyvilleof Kelburn, and Richard 
de Boyville of Ryesholm, were subscribers of the Ragman Roll in 
1296. Both of these properties have remained in the family since 
these dates. Kelburn Castle was originally a square tower; but 
an addition was made to it by David, Earl of Glasgow. It is thus 
noticed by Pont: " Kelburne Castell, a goodly building, veill 
planted, having werey beutifull orchards and gardens, and in one 
of them a spatious rome adorned with a christalin fontane, cufte 
all out of the living rocke. It belongs heritably to John Boll, 
Laird thereof." 

Brisbane of that Ilk. — This family is acknowledged the chief of

itheir name. In the fourteenth century, Donald Earl of Lennox 
.granted a charter of the lands of Mucherach and Holmedalmar- 
ityne, in the Lennox, to " Alano dicto Brisbane, 6lio quondam 
Willielmi Brisbane." Chart de Levenax, p. 61. Thomas and 
Alexander Brisbane are witnesses to a charter, in the thirty-second 
'year of David II., 1361, granted at Kyndromy, by Thomas Earl of 
' Mar, and which is confirmed by the King. Thomas Brisbane is wit- 
iness to a charter by Robert Duke of Albany, dated at Perth, 22d 
: September 1409. The earliest estate which seems to have belonged 
I to this family was that of Bishopton, in Renfrewshire, which they 
1 held prior to 1400; and they had then acquired the L.IO land of 
Killincraig and Gogo in this parish. To these several additions 
were made; and in 1595 the whole were erected into the barony 
of Gogoside. Other possessions having been acquired by the fa- 
mily, the whole were, in 1650, erected into the barony of Nod- 
dle. Soon after this, having acquired the property of Overkel- 
soland, which long had belonged to the family of Kelso, the whole 
estate was, in 1695, by a Crown charter, erected into the barony 
of Brisbane. The House of Brisbane is situated in the vale of 
that name, and is of considerable antiquity, and surrounded with 
some fine old trees. The present proprietor, Sir Thomas Mac- 
dougal Brisbane is a man of high celebrity, as well for his valour 
in the field, as for his labours in the cause of science. He mar- 
ried the heiress of Makerston, in consequence of which he unites 
the name, honours, and estate of that family with his own. 

Frazer of Knock. — This family was a cadet of the Frazers of 
Lovat, and acquired the estate by the marriage of the heiress about 
1400. They continued to flourish for about 250 years; after which 
they declined, and the estate was broken up and passed into other 
hands. Pont says that " Knock is a pretty dwelling, seatted one 
the mane occeane, and veill planted." The ruins of the house 
still remain. The property now belongs to John Wilson, Esq. 
who, with laudable zeal, has recently adopted means to prevent 
the ravages of the climate on the venerable remains of what was 
once the " pretty dwelling" of the Frazers. 

Montgomery of SMmurhj. — The lands of Skelmurly in this pa- 
rish were, with other lands, given by Alexander, first Lord Mont- 
gomery, in 1461, to his second son, George, who married Ann, 
daughter of Sir John Houston of that Ilk. The house is plea- 
santly situated on an eminence commanding a prospect of great 
beauty and extent. It is thus noticed, by Pont: " North Skel-

murly is a fair veill built housse, and pleasantly seatted, decorred 
with orchards and woodes, the inheritance of Robert Montgomery, 
laird thereof, quho holds it of ye Earls of Glencairn." The es- 
tate reverted by succession to the house of Eglinton ; and now 
belongs to Archibald William, Earl of Eglinton and Winton. 

Wilson of Ha/Ue.— This family has existed" since 1483, and the 
property has passed in regular male succession from that date to 
the present owner, James Wilson of Haylie and Quarter, &amp;c. 

Parochial Registers.—There is no regular record of births and 
baptisms prior to the Revolution, and long after that epoch the 
record was very imperfect. It has of late been better kept. 

Antiquities.— le have in course of this report taken notice in- 
cidentally of several of the most ancient buildings in the parish. 
The principal remains of antiquity are those connected with the 
battle of Largs, in 1263. Immediately above Haylie, to the east, 
there is a small hill on which there are still visible the remains of 
an encampment. It bears the name of Castle Hill. At the back 
of the mansion-house of Haylie there are the remains of a tumu- 
lus, which was doubtless erected over the bodies of those who fell 
in that conflict. It was called Margaret's Law; but this was pro- 
bably the corruption of some other name. The only other vestige 
which has withstood the changes of modern times, is the barrow 
close by the west wall of the burying-ground, which corroborates 
the Norwegian account of their dead having been interred at the 
church. Near the spot now inclosed as the garden of Dr Cairnie, 
. there stood a rude stone pillar, which was reputed as commemo- 
rative of the place where Haco, the Norwegian commander, fall. 
The stone has been built by Dr Cairnie in his garden wall, and 
now bears the following appropriate inscription : 

Substit. Hie Gothi Furor. 
Conditur hie Haco Steniensis, et undique, circum 
Norvegios fidos terra tegit Socios : 
Hue regnum venere petentes ; Scotia victor 
Hostibus hie tumulos, praemia justa dedit.

There is a small piece of land which was originally lying runrig in 
seven dilFerent parts called Breedsorrow. Pont gives the origin 
ofthe name thus, " Breedsorrow is the possession of tlie laird of Blare, 
and being a small hamlet, it is so named, because of grate sorrow 
it bred amongst neighbours debettaing and contesting for ye heri-

table right thereof." This place was also called Kempisland. 
Thus we find that, on 8th May 1610, John Birsbaneof Bishopton, 
was served heir of his father, Robert Birsbane, in the six shilling 
eight penny land of old extent of Breedsorrow, alias Kempisland ; 
and in 1639, Sir Bryce Blair of Blair was served heir-male to his 
father, Bryce Blair, in the same subject. This change of proper- 
ty proves that Font's account must have been written between 
these two dates, as is generally supposed. Similar names occur in 
different parts of Scotland, having the same apparent origin, where 
there had been kemping, striving, contending, or fighting, such as 
Kemp's fold, in Caputh parish, Kemp's Castle near Forfar. See 
Jam. Diet, voce Kemp. 

The Skelmorly aisle of the old church, with the monument 
erected by Sir Robert Montgomery, and the painted adornments 
of the ceiling, are still nearly in the same condition as they were in 
1793. It is an object which attracts and well merits the attention 
of the curious in the progress of art in this country. It is entitled 
to careful preservation, being unquestionably the most magnificent 
sepulchral design at present extant in the west of Scotland.

The following table shows the progressive increase since 1755, 
but the contrast with the population of the early part of the seven- 
teenth century, as elsewhere noticed, is remarkable. 

In 1755, the population was 1164 

1790, . 1139 

1801, . 1381 

1811, . 1801 

1821, . 2479 

1831, . 2848 

1841, . 3554 

The enumeration under the plan of the late census was 4054, 
but of these 550 were strangers. The population'attached to the 
district or quoad sacra parish of Fairlie, is 450, which is included 
in the return for 1841, as above stated. 

From the inquiries made for the Church Commission, it appears 
that the religious statistics may be thus classified :

The lands of the parish, although stated to amount to 37| 
square miles, and of course 24,160 acres, yet the actual survey of 

the parish only amounts to 19,143 acres, which may be divided as 
follows, viz. 

In tillage, - - . 1145 acres. 

In pasture and meadow, - . . 3300

Husbandry. — The rotation of crops upon the lands in tillage, 
including the hay crop, is commonly a six years rotation, \st year, 
oats ; 2d, green crop ; Qd, oats, wheat, or barley, according to the 
nature of the soil ; Ath, hay ; bth and Qth, pasture. Wheat of 
late has not been much sown, and that only on heavy lands. The 
rotation of the lands lying near Largs and Fairlie is generally a 
four years shift, owing to the nearness of manure. Flax is now so 
little cultivated, that two flax-mills in the parish, one at Constable 
wood, the other at Gogoside, have been allowed to fall into ruin. 

The number of milk cows kept in the parish is about 604, all 
of the very best Ayrshire breed. The farmers at a distance from 
the town make cheese with all the cream or skim-milk cheese and 
butter, while those near the town either sell all their milk to the 
inhabitants, or churn all their milk, make butter, and supply the 
town with butter-milk. The young cows reared yearly amount 



LAllGS. 



803 



to about 300 ; cattle fattened about 484 : sheep -kept upon the 
high lands, about 4680,besides a few English sheep on some of 
the low lands : the number of horses about 130, and of horses 
rearing about 30 ; the old practice of hiring horses is now almost 
exploded. Swine are very generally kept. 

Great improvements have been made, and are in progress upon . 
the different estates and farms in the parish, within these few years. 
Upon Kelburn estate, Mr Johnstone, the active and intelligent 
factor of the Earl of Glasgow, has more than doubled the value 
of many of the parks ; he has also added much to the beauty of 
the estate, by plantations, laid off to great advantage. Upon Bris- 
bane estate, much also has been done about the mansion-house, in 
extending the lawn, by removing the old garden, and in making a 
new approach. The tenants have also been doing a great deal in 
draining and bringing in waste lands, particularly the tenants of 
Bankhead and South Whittleburn. The tenant of south Con- 
stable wood has done much in that way ; the tenant of Quarter has 
also, within the last year, drained twelve acres upon the most ap- 
proved plan. The proprietor cuts the drains and quarries the 
stones, the tenant carts the stones and fills the drains. The drains 
when furrow, and at the distance of 12 feet, are, at the sur- 
face, 20 inches, 2 feet deep, and 10 inches at the bottom; the 
stones thin, and all set upon their edges, and covered with 
broken metal to within 9 inches of the surface. The leading or 
principal drains are never less than 2 feet deep, 2 feet wide at 
the surface, and 14 inches at the bottom, when set; when piped, 
not less than 20 inches at the bottom ; the depth of the leading 
drains depends upon the nature of the soil. Mr Wilson of Knock, 
by laying out a very considerable sum in bringing in waste lands, 
draining, liming, planting, making roads and bridges, has not on- 
ly beautified that estate, but more than doubled its value. Cap- 
tain Alexander Montgomery, R. N., well known in the district for 
his laudable zeal in all institutions calculated to advance the com- 
fort and improve the condition of the farmer, has much improved 
the lands of Bridgend, upon the estate of Skelmorlie. Mr Stew- 
art has also improved his lands of Blackhouse, and Mr Lang, his 
lands of Routenburn. The tenant of Auchengarth upon the Third- 
part estate has also done much in liming and draining. 

Quarries.— In the grounds of Haylee, there was a quarry of 
excellent sandstone, from which the greater part of the newly 
erected houses were built ; but, being exhausted, a new quarry has 



804 



AYRSHIRE. 



been opened on the Earl of Glasgow's grounds to the south, 
which affords the present supply. 

Manufactures.— The only public work is that recently erected 
at Bankhouse, by Mr George Henderson. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Since the commencement of the present century, no town in 
the county has been so completely enlarged and remodelled, nor 
its environs so much beautified with villas, the most of which are 
in a superior style of architecture. A few of the old tenements 
still remain, and exhibit a very humble appearance when compared 
with those of modern construction. The only building of a public 
character is the Baths, which contain, besides hot and cold baths, 
a spacious billiard and reading-room. 

Villages. — The only village in the parish is that of Fairlie, 
which is pleasantly situated on the coast, at the south end of the 
parish. There are several handsome villas set down, and the 
spot is so attractive and retired, that many prefer it to Largs. 
Both are most desirable places, having all the charms of nature 
in her pleasing variety : — 

" Where smiling spring its early visit pays, 

And parting summer's lingering bloom delays." 

Means of Communication. — Since the last Statistical Account 
of the parish was written, an excellent new turnpike road, across 
the moor, from Largs to Kilbirnie and Dairy, has been made, 
which has been of the utmost benefit to Largs. 

Lime to any extent can be had at Hourat lime-work, a distance 
of about seven miles, for 10s. the chaldron ; and the landed pro- 
prietors and tenants have not failed to take advantage of it. Coals 
are also brought from the pits in these parishes, a distance of about 
eight miles ; the price at the pit is 3s. 4d. for fourteen hundred- 
weight. A parish road has also been made through the Vale of 
Brisbane to the boundary of the parish, near Loch Thom, which 
joins the Greenock parish road. This road is of much benefit to 
the farmers on the line, and general traveller, as it shortens the 
distance from Largs to Greenock about two miles. There are 
in all thirteen miles of turnpike, and eleven miles of parish roads. 

Harbour. — When steam-boats began to ply between Glasgow 
and Largs, the want of a harbour was much felt in the landing of 
passengers and goods. Upon application to Sir Thomas Mac- 
dougal Brisbane, Bart., he agreed to give the ground for a pier, 
to take shares for the price, and to extend the boundaries of the 
harbour from Haylie to Noddleburn ; a subscription was entered 



LARGS. oO 

into ; an act of Parliament applied for, and obtained in May 1832 ; 
the foundation stone laid with masonic honours, 10th January 
1833, after the work was in considerable progress. It was first 
used, 1st December 1834. The cost was L.4275, which is held 
in L.50 shares. The number of shareholders is 31. The ave- 
rage revenue, for the last six years, has been six per cent. The 
benefit it affords, in landing and shipping passengers and goods, 
&amp;c. is very great. 

EccUsiaatical History. — The church of Largs was dedicated to 
St Columba, the celebrated Abbot of lona, and was a rectory, the 
patronage of which belonged to the lordship of Largs. We have 
evidence that this church existed long prior to the battle of Largs, 
in 1263 ; and in the Norwegian account of that expedition, we 
are told that a number of the dead were buried at the church. 
On 30th January 1318-19, as has been previously mentioned, 
Walter the Stewart, for the safety of his soul, and that of his 
spouse, Marjory Brus, granted to the monks of Paisley the church 
of Largs, in pure and perpetual alms, with all the tithes thereto 
pertaining. This grant was to take place at the death, or resig- 
nation, or promotion, of Sir William de Lindsay, the rector of 
the said church. On the 3d of February following, the chapter 
of Glasgow, during the vacancy of that see, gave to the monks of 
Paisley, formal possession of the church of Largs, and the chapter 
of Glasgow granted a charter of confirmation to the monks of 
their title to the church of Largs, from Walter the Stewart. 
John Wishart, who was made Bishop of Glasgow in 1319, granted 
and contirmed, to the monks of Paisleyj the church of Largs, and 
the chapel of Cumbray, with all their pertinents. This chapel 
was in the island of Great Cumbray, opposite to the southern 
part of the parish of Largs, but in the shire of Bute. The church 
of Largs continued to belong to the monastery of Paisley after 
the Reformation. At that epoch, the tithes of the church of 
Largs, with those of the churches of Inverkip and Lochwinnoch, 
in Renfrewshire, in all produced to the monks of Paisley, L. 4 60 
a-year, having been let in lease for payment of that sum. In 1587, 
Lord Claud Hamilton, the commendator of Paisley, obtained a 
grant of the patronage and tithes of the church of Largs, with the 
other revenues of the monks of Paisley, the whole of which was 
then created a temporal lordship, for him and his heirs, with the 
title of Lord Paisley. He was succeeded, in 1621, in all those 
estates, revenues, and titles, by his grandson, .lamps Earl of Aber-

corn. In Charles I.'s reign, the patronage and tithes of the church 
of Largs passed from the Earl of Abercorn to Sir Robert Mont- 
gomery of Skelmorlie, who, in 1636, erected, in an aisle on the 
north side of the church, a handsome burial-place and monument, 
of which some notice is elsewhere taken. Lilias Montgomery, 
who became the heiress of Skelmorlie, by marriage, in 1733, car- 
ried the patronage and tithes of the church of Largs to Alexander 
Montgomery of Coylsfield. Their son and heir, Colonel Hugh 
Montgomery of Coylsfield, succeeded to the Earldom of Eglinton 
in 1796; and his grandson, Archibald William Earl of Eglinton 
and Winton, is now patron of the church of Largs. 

Immediately after the Reformation, we find that in 1567 David 
Neil was exhorter at Largs, with 40 raerks of stipend, and in 
1576, Alexander Callendar was minister, his stipend being L.134, 
6s. 8d. Scots, with the kirk land of Kilbryde, and that David 
Neil was then reidare, his stipend L. IG, with the kirk land, &amp;c. 
In 1598, William Cole was minister. He appears as one of the 
subscribers to the letter of admission in favour of Alexander Camp- 
bell to the kirk of Ardrossan. Mr Cole was succeeded by Tho- 
mas Craig-, who was minister in 1635, as appears from a decree of 
locality of stipend obtained at his instance, in that year. The next 
minister of whom we have notice is William Smith, who died of 
the plague. He was buried in a sequestered spot near Brisbane 
House. Over his grave is a flat stone with this inscription, ' Here 
layeth William Smith, minister of Largs, a faithful minister of 
the gospel, removed by the pestilence in 1646." The inscription 
was renewed in 1710, and again in 1760. In 1672, John Wal- 
lace was appointed along with Alexander Gordon, under the se- 
cond Indulgence; but, having been charged with transgressing the 
rules, he was called before the council, and treated with more 
than usual severity. Mr Wallace was a man of some means. 

• The following account is given by Wodrow, Burns' edition, Vol. iii. p. 5. " Last 
year, in November, Mr John Wallace indulged at the Largs, and Mr Patrick Simp- 
son indulged at Kilmalcom, had been cited before the council for breaking their 
confinement. Mr John Wallace appeared, and was remitted to the committee for 
public alTliirs. And this year, February 15th, I find the council again call Mr 
Simpson, and upon his non-conipearance they order him to be denounced, ''i' 
kept him from compearing I know not, but it hath been some necessary excuse, for 
1 know lie continued several years after this in the peaceable exercise of his ministry 
in that place. iMr John Wallace is called before the council, February 18th, and no 
proliation being adduced as to his breach of his confinement, lie deponed upon the 
verity of his libel, and frankly told them how matters stood, as to that practice com- 
mon to him and his brethren. It was hut few of the council were lor depriving him 
of his indulgence upon this score, and so other occasions against hiin were sought ; 
and being called in after he had lieeii removed, the council intcrrogntcil hnn, as_tlicy 
say, for llie further clearing of his deposition, though, as far as I can find, his dcpo-

In 1666, he acquired the lands of Monkcastle and Craigmill from 
John Hay, and transmitted them to his family, who sold them m 
1703 to Mr Adam Cunninghame, advocate. He was succeeded 
in Largs by Mr Charles Littlejohn. Fountainhall, states that, 
" on his pursuing Montgumerie of Skelmurlie for his stipend, the 
chancellor had this expression, that the ministers were the persons 
in the kingdom that deserved worst at his Majesty's hands." ,Mr 
Littlejohn was succeeded by Mr John Wilson, who was ordained 
26th December 1697. He had been previously settled in Ireland, 
and received a call to Kilmarnock, but declined to accept. He 
was succeeded by Andrew Cuming, who was ordained 27th Sep- 
tember 1701. He remained in the charge until his death in 1762. 
Patrick Wallace was ordained his assistant and successor on 10th 
August 1748, but, having predeceased him, Gilbert Lang was or- 
dained to the office on 3d August 1756. He died in 1791, and 
was succeeded by Stephen Rowan, who was ordained 15th May 
1792, and died 4th June 1801. His successor was John Mitchell, 
M. D., who was ordained 22d April 1802. In 1826, he was ap- 
pointed Professor of Divinity in the University of St Andrews, 
and on his removal, was succeeded by Jacob Richardson, who was 
ordained 28th September 1826, and having died 6th October 
1830, was succeeded by the present incumbent, who was ordained 
28th April 1831. 

By the decree of locality at Mr Craig's instance in 1635, it ap- 
pears that the lands of Southanan, Whiteside, and Corsby, were 
in the parish of Largs, and after their disjunction and annexation 
to Kilbride, the stipend of the parish was 8 chalders and 8 bolls 
victual, for stipend and communion elements. This stipend con- 
tinued until after the death of Mr Rowan, when Dr Mitchell got 
an augmentation in 1807, of 43 bolls meal, and 43 bolls barley, 
with L.8, 6s. 8d. of communion elements, so that the whole sti- 
pend was 13 chalders, and 14 bolls of victual, and L.8, 6s. 8d. of 
money. The stipend is now 128 bolls meal, 128 bolls barley, 
and L.IO money, to which it was moditied 7th July 1830. 

The church and parish were in the Presbytery of Irvine until 
1834, when they were transferred to the newly formed Presbytery 

sition had no connection with this ' whether he would for the future refuse to give 
baptism to the children of such parents as took tiie bond for public peace ' This be- 
ing new to him, and what he did not understand the design of, craved that he might 
be spared as to such things as related to the discharge of his ministerial office. He 
is presently removed, and the council decern him to have lost the benefit of his indul- 
gence at the Largs, or any where else ; and appoint their sentence to be intimated 
to the parishioners, that they may pay him no more stipend. I do not find the in- 
dulged ministers were before challenged upon this score."

of Greenock. At Fairlie, a chapel in connexion with the Esta- 
blishment was erected by private subscription in 1833, opened in 
1834, and erected as a quoad sacra parish in 1835. It contains 
300 sitters, and affords great accommodation to the inhabitan's of 
that district of the parish. The first minister of this congregation 
was James Gardiner, who died in 1835, and was succeeded by the 
Reverend John Gemmill, A.M., the present minister. 

The church was removed from the burying-ground situated in 
the centre of the village, and a new one built, in a more open and 
eligible situation in 1812. It was seated for 900, but, being found 
too small, particularly for the extra population of the summer, cross 
aisles were added to its eastern extremity in 1832, which accom- 
modate 432 additional sitters. This addition was made from funds 
belonging to the poor, and the seats are annually let out, and the 
rents yield a good return, which adds to the ordinary funds ex- 
pended by the kirk-session. 

The manse stood formerly in the immediate vicinity of the old 
church, and near the site of the Brisbane Arms Inn, now belonging 
to Mrs Strachan. It was sold by the minister and heritors in 1764, 
when the present manse and offices were built on part of the glebe. 
The house has been recently repaired, and is a comfortable and 
commodious residence. The glebe consists of seven acres. 

Dissenters. — A congregation of the United Associate Synod 
was formed here about 1780. Their first minister was William 
Watson, who was ordained 15th January 1783. He was translated 
to Old Kilpatrick in 1789. In December 1791, John Leech was 
ordained as his successor, who demitted, and died in Glasgow in 
1822, being succeeded by Daniel Maclean, who was ordained 22d 
October 1823, and deposed 29th November 1829. He was suc- 
ceeded by the present minister, William Steven, who was ordain- 
ed 31st August 1830. The church was rebuilt in 1826, and is 
seated for nearly 700 sitters. There is also a comfortable manse 
for the minister. 

Acongregation of Relief is now being formed. A small meeting- 
house has been erected, capable of containing 450 sitters ; but 
hitherto no minister has been ordained. 

Education. — There was a parochial scliool in 1696, with a sa- 
lary of 100 merks, but no school-house. In 1809, a comfortable 
school and schoolmaster's house were built by the heritors. The 
present schoolmaster is Alexander Jack, who has under his charge 
115 scholars. Sir Thomas M. Brisbane has recently, at the ex- 



LARGS. 



809 



pense of L. 350, built a commodious school and schoolmaster's 
house, and has endowed the school to the extent of L.30 yearly, 
vesting the nomination of the teacher, and the general manage- 
ment and superintendence of the institution in the family of Bris- 
bane, and the minister and kirk-session of Largs. His sole ob- 
ject is to secure to the children of the working- classes, education 
in the common branches of learning, at a- reasonable rate. This 
adds a fresh laurel to the well-earned fame of the honourable 
founder, and it is hoped will prove a grateful monument to his me- 
mory for many ages. The school is well attended, and gives fair 
promise of utility. There are in the parish three other schools, 
besides one at Fairlie, and a female school, which are well taught. 
The total number of scholars is 428. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The funds for support of the poor 
arise from the collections at the church door, the seat rents of the 
addition made to the church, and fees of .proclamations. The 
average amount is about L.247. The number of paupers on the 
permanent roll is 40, besides 13 orphans. The highest allowance 
is 10s., the lowest 53. monthly. There are others who receive oc- 
casional supply. 

Libraries. — There are two circulating libraries, which contain 
the standard histories, and the popular works of the day. There 
is also a congregational library attached to the church, and a so- 
ciety for the distribution of religious tracts. 

Gas-Work. — A gas-work was erected in 1838, the capital being 
formed of shares of L.5 each. The streets and houses were first 
lighted in 1839, and the parish church has recently been fitted up, 
and gas is now used at all evening exercises held there. 

Banks. — There is a branch of the Western Bank of Scotland, 
and one of the Paisley Commercial Banking Company, which 
have been found of great utility, as, previous to their being esta- 
blished, the inhabitants were obliged to travel to Greenock or to 
Beith with all their bank transactions. 

Fairs. — As previously mentioned, the ancient church of Largs 
was dedicated to St Columba, whose festival was commemorated 
on the 9th June. This fair is still held here on the second Tuesday 
of June, O.S., and is vulgarly called Combsday. It used to be fa- 
mous all over the West of Scotland, and multitudes came to it, 
especially from the Western Highlands. The night previous to the 
fair was spent in frivolous amusement, which frequently ended in 
riot. This is no longer the case. The attendance has greatly fallen 



810 



AYRSHIRE. 



oT in consequence of the general diffusion of merchandise by 
steam-boats, which carry to the islands of the west the comforts of 
civilized life at all periods of the year. The fair is still of consi- 
derable importance as a market for young cattle, which are brought 
from the Highlands, and bought by farmers and graziers. 
Miscellaneous Observations. 
After the plague broke out, Largs suffered most severely, and 
the common people were reduced to great distress. Soon'after- 
wards, some cases of reputed witchcraft occurred in the parish ; 
but, on enquiry, the charge was found groundless, and the accu- 
sation passed away. The following remarkable incident is given 
by the celebrated gossip. Law, in his Memorials, p. 245 : « Aprile 
1683. At the Largs, in the west of Scotland, a man at his plough 
knocks down his servant man, taying the horse, immediately goes 
home, his wife asking for the servant man, he gives her a Vough 
answer. She goes out to look after him ; ere she returned he 
hanged himself. She coming in with a child in her arms, seeing 
her husband hanging, fell down on the ground and the child in 
her arms, with the fall broke its neck, — a sad spectacle." 

In the early part of the last century, Largs gradually recovered 
from its depression ; but the population were generally averse to 
strangers, incomers being looked upon in an unfavourable light. 
After the place became the resort of summer visitors, a new 
population was engrafted on the old stock, and the extension of 
the town and the building of villas in its vicinity produced a 
great improvement. Largs now vies with its neighbours in all 
the duties of hospitality and good neighbourhood, and the society 
is cheerful and friendly among themselves. The better classes 
are attentive to the poor, and, in seasons of distress and privation, 
are always ready to give relief. 

The gentlemen of Largs and their visitors have been much in- 
debted to Mr Cairnie of Curling Hall, for the sport they enjoy in 
summer at bowling upon his beautiful bowling-green, and in winter 
for the national, manly, and exhilarating game of curling upon his 
curling-pond, designed and constructed by himself on a new and 
scientific principle, by which ice is formed fit for use in one night, 
when the thermometer stands at 32'' of Fahrenheit, at 14 feet of 
elevation above the surface of the ground. Hence this sport can 
be enjoyed here earlier and more frequently than in the usual 
places of resort for this pastime. The game of billiards is another 
source of amusement, while, to those who prefer the enjoyment of

nature, the walks in the neighbourhood, either along the beach or 
through the adjoining groves and plantations, afford an unceasing 
source of pleasure. In these respects it must be admitted, that 
this favourite place of resort is unrivalled in the westof Scotland.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. ARCHIBALD BLAIR CAMPBELL, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name, Extent, Kilwinning takes its name from St Win- 
nin, a Scottish saint of the eighth century, to whom the ancient 
church of this place was dedicated. The greatest length of this 
parish, between the borders of Beith and Stevenston, is about 7 
miles, and its greatest breadth, between the borders of Ardrossan 
and Irvine, is about 5 miles. According to Aitken's map, pub- 
lished in 1828, it contains 17 square miles, or 11,200 acres. It 
is situate in Cunninghame, the northern district of the county of 
Ayr, and is bounded on the west by Stevenston and Ardros- 
san ; on the east, by Dunlop, Stewarton, and Irvine ; on the 
south, by Irvine and Stevenston ; and on the north, by Dairy and 
Beith. 

The figure of the parish is very irregular. Its surface gra- 
dually slopes upwards from the south-west to the north-east, and 
is varied by gentle undulations, but nowhere rises to any conside- 
rable elevation. It is intersected by the valleys of the Garnock 
and Lugton ; the former, open and cultivated ; the latter, more 
narrow and woody. The view from the upland district is exten- 
sive and beautiful, sweeping down the vale of the Garnock, on the 
one hand, and on the other, over the woods of Mountgreenan and 
Eglinton to the sea, and embracing the towns of Saltcoats, Ste- 
venston, Kilwinning, and Irvine, the bay and headlands of Ayr, 
the rock of Ailsa, the Mull of Cantyre, and the serrated range of 
the Arran mountains.

generally a thin clay, not fertile or productive, especially where 
the surface water has not been removed by tile-draining, though 
nearly the whole is under the plough, except what is occupied by 
plantations of forest trees. A better description of clay land is 
found on the slopes towards the river Garnock ; and along its mar- 
gin are some good loamy fields. From the town of Kilwinning 
towards the sea, there is a portion of light sandy soil, well culti- 
vated and fertile. To the eastward, near Auchentiber, there re- 
main probably sixty or seventy acres of a peat-bog, which was for- 
merly much more extensive, a considerable part of it having been 
reclaimed and improved in the course of the present century. 

Climate. — The climate of this parish, like that of the west of 
Scotland in general, though mild, is moist and variable. Amongst 
the endemic diseases engendered by it, the most prevalent is rheu- 
matism, in all its forms. The peasantry who labour during the 
winter months at tile-draining, and other field work, often suffer 
from it severely, as well as aged and poor people in the town. Con- 
sumption is not unfrequent. In the town of Kilwinning, fever, 
typhus mitior, very often occurs, and is more endemical than in 
the neighbouring towns. Epidemical diseases, which are not more 
common than in other places, are generally very mild, and easily 
yield to medical treatment. In 200 cases of scarlet fever, attend- 
ed by one practitioner during the year 1837, only five deaths oc- 
curred. On the whole, the inhabitants of the parish enjoy an or- 
dinary length of days, and share of good health. 

Hydrography . — The most considerable stream in this parish 
is the Garnock. It rises in the hills above Kilbirnie, about twelve 
miles from the town of Kilwinning, which it intersects, and, after 
a remarkably circuitous and serpentine course through the \o\s 
lands to the west, falls into the sea at the same point with the river 
Irvine. The Lugton, a small stream, flows out of Loch Libo, in 
Renfrewshire, enters this parish near its eastern extremity, and, 
after passing through the woods of Mountgreenan and Eglinton, 
falls into the Garnock, about two miles from the sea. The Caaf 
water, also a tributary of the Garnock, forms part of the boundary 
line, for a short distance, betwixt this parish and Dairy. At 
Craighead mill, it falls over a rock of considerable height, and 
forms a pretty little linn or cascade in a narrow wooded dell. 
There is a sheet of water, about a mile and a-half to the north- 
west of Kilwinning town, called Ashenyard, or Ashgrove Loch. 
It is not of great extent, and part of it is included in Stevensfon.

In the town and neighbourhood, an ample supply of the finest 
spring-water is obtained, as is almost invariably the case, through- 
out Scotland, around the sites of ancient monasteries, or other re- 
ligious houses. 

Geology and Mineralogy — The coal formation extends through- 
out the whole of this parish. The strata dip to the south, forming 
an angle with the horizon of from eight to twelve degrees. They 
are intersected by a number of whinstone dikes, running from 
east to west, and varying in thickness from five to twenty feet. 
These dikes cut the strata, without altering their general inclina- 
tion, except when accompanied by slips, which is sometimes the 
case. Where there are no dikes, slips also frequently occur, 
breaking the continuity of the strata, while the different beds re- 
tain their relative positions, at different levels, and continue their 
course with the same inclination which they had before meeting 
with the slips. These slips vary in height from a few inches to 
ninety feet, and almost always run in an easterly and westerly di- 
rection. The outburst of the main coal, which is the lowest in 
the series of coals above the limestone, passes from west to east, 
nearly through the centre of the parish. It is four feet thick, and 
of good quality. Above this are seven other workable seams, in 
the following ascending order, viz. the stone-coal, feet ; ell 
coal, 2; ; Ladyha coal, 2 ; little coal, 2 ; turf-coal, 3 ; parrot- 
coal, 3 ; and five-quarter coal, 4 feet thick. They are situate 
at the respective distances from the main coal, and from each 
other, of 5, 10, -7, 48, 3, 2-, and 11 fathoms. All are of good 
quality. The seams, at present wrought at the different collieries, 
are the following, viz. at Doura, the ell and stone-coals ; at Fer- 
gushill, the stone and main coals ; at Redstone, the stone-coal ; 
and, at Eglinton colliery, the Ladyha, ell, stone, and main coals. 
It is worthy of notice, that, on the western side, the bed of main 
coal is longitudinally split by a layer of shale, a few inches thick ; 
but, to the east of Fergushill, and all through the lands of Doura, 
this layer increases in thickness to some fathoms, dividing the 
main coal into two distinct seams, of about two feet in thickness 
each, and, on this account, unworkable. Throughout the whole 
extent of Doura lands, and part of Fergushill, the four upper 
seams of coal have been but partially excavated, and are not 
wrought at present. A seam of coal, of rather inferior quality,

tacksman of the Eglinton colliery.

2 feet ill thickness, is found at the depth of seven fathoms below 
the Umestone. It was partially wrought, some years ago, at 
Monkredding and Mountgreenan. Other seams are supposed to 
exist lower down, having been found in contemporaneous strata, 
in the adjoining parishes. Beyond the outburst of the main coal, 
limestone is found, appearing near the surface at Bunnach, 
Lylestone, Clonbeath, and Mountgreenan. Where it has been 
worked, it is five feet thick, and of good quality. It runs below 
the main coal, at a distance from it of about 70 fathoms. At 
Cartleburn, one mile to the north of the town, a bed of limestone, 
eighteen feet thick, is found cropping out. It has sometimes 
been wrought, and is of good quality, being almost entirely com- 
posed of fossil shells. The working of this bed was confined to 
the above locality, the outburst not having been found in any other 
place. 

Ironstone bands, it is' not doubted, might be found in abundance 
in connexion with the limestone beds, but have not been explored. 
They are seen, however, in corresponding strata on the Ardrossan 
shore, where they are numerous, and some of them are of the 
black-band kind, so much prized by ironmasters. 

In some of the shales which intervene betwixt the coals, fossil 
vegetable remains, chiefly of the fern tribe, are found in great 
abundance. Balls of ironstone, in great quantities, and of various 
sizes, likewise occur, and also fossil shell-fish, generally mussels, 
with their shapes as entire and well-defined as if gathered alive 
upon the shore. 

The nature of the various soils has been already adverted to. 
The subsoil generally, throughout the parish, consists of a tenaci- 
ous blue clay, thickly interspersed with boulders, chiefly of whin- 
stone, and of various sizes. In some parts, a bed of gravel is found 
above the blue clay and stones, and above the gravel a deposit of 
clay, entirely free from stones. It is used for making draining- 
tiles and building-bricks. 

Zuologij. — Among the mammalia may be mentioned Lutra vul- 
garis, the otter, a most successful salmon-fisher, occasionally de- 
tected poaching in the Garnock. From the near neighbourhood 
of the Irish Channel, the seafowl which frequent it are often seen 
in this parish, the rarer descriptions of which may be found speci- 
fied in the Statistical Account of Stevenston. The following is a 
list, imperfect, we fear, of the rarer birds that may be found in this 
parish : —

Pike and perch are found in Ashgrove Loch ; sahnon and sal- 
mon-trout in the river Garnock. The fisheries in this stream were 
much more productive in former times than at present. The pro- 
gress of agriculture diminishing the supplies of pabulum for the 
tish, the increase of population augmenting the number of poach- 
ers, together with the prevalence of stake-net fishing along the 
shore, near the mouth of the river, are causes which may, in part, 
account for this change. The river now yields no rent, and is 
preserved for angling, but seldom affords much sport to the dis- 
ciples of Isaac Walton.

The finest forest trees in this neighbourhood are in the park at 
Eglinton. They are of unknown age and large size, consisting 
chiefly of oak, elm, and beech, which last predominate. The park 
is of great extent and thickly wooded, and beyond it considerable 
plantations have been formed by successive Earls of Eglinton, 
during the last seventy years. The mansion-houses of Mount- 
greenan, Monkcastle, and Ashgrove, are also surrounded with 
thriving plantations of different ages, and a considerable part of 
the parish is thus sheltered and ornamented. 

II. — Civil History. 

I am not acquainted with any work except the former Statistical 
Account, devoted exclusively to the history of this parish. It is 
noticed in Timothy Pout's " Cunningham Topographized," MS. 
Avocates' Library, and in Chalmers's Caledonia. A full account 
of it is given in Robertson's Topographical Description of Cun- 
ninghame. The records of the regality of Kilwinning are preserv- 
ed in the Register- Office. The chartulary of the monastery has 
unfortunately been lost. 

The history of the parish begins with that of the patron Saint, 
from whom it derives its name.  In the calendar of Scottish 

 l''or the following notice of St Winning, and some others relating to the aiui- 



816 



AYRSHIRE. 



Saints, the date assigned to St Winnin or Winning, is 715, and 
his festival was held on the 21st of January, on which day, O.S. 
there is still an annual fair held here, called St Winning's day. 
In Font's MS. it is said, that " Vinnin was a holy man wich came 
from Irland, with certane of his discipells and. followers, and heir 
taught the Gospell ; the place of his residence retaining still ye 
name Killvinnin, ye church or cell of Vinnin, unto quhome, as to 
a notable sante, ye superstitious posterity dedicated." In the Pro- 
prium Sanctorum, a different parentage is given to St Winnin, as 
he is there said to have sprung of a noble family in Scotland. He 
was famous for his power in curing diseases, and for his control 
over the elements. In the parish of Holy wood, a fountain of pre- 
cious virtue sprung up on his intercession, and remained in repute 
until the beginning of the sixteenth century. A spring of fine 
water, a little to the south of Kilwinning manse, which still bears 
the name of St Winning's Well, was also celebrated for its vir- 
tues. But St Winnin could curse the waters as well as bless them, 
for on one occasion, when the river Garnock would not yield up 
any of his fish to one of his angling friends, the saint pronounced 
a malediction, on which the river " left its bed, and followed an- 
other course adverse to nature." 

The fame and sanctity of St Winnin led to the building of the 
splendid monastery, near the site of the more ancient church of 
this place. According to the commonly received account, it was 
founded in the reign of David I., a. d. 1140, by Hugh de More- 
ville. Constable of Scotland, the chief beneftxctor, if not also the 
founder, of Dryburgh Abbey. In the Pont manuscript before 
quoted, however, a different origin is assigned to it, and the date 
of the foundation, or perhaps the completion of the buildings, is 
placed in the year 1591 : "It was foundit by a noble Englich- 
man, named Sir Richard Morwell, fugitive from his owne country 
for ye slaughter of Thomas Beccket, Archbichope of Canterbur- 
rey, being one of them, in the raine of King Henry II. of Eng- 
land, quho, flying to Scotland, was, by the then Scots King" 
Malcolm IV. he elsewhere affirms, " velcomed and honoured 
with ye office of grate Constable of Scotland, as also inriched with 
ye Lordships of Cunninghame, Largis, and Lauderdaill, quhosse 

quities of the parish, I am indebted to James Dobie, Esq., Beith, — a gentlcmaii rich 
in antiquarian lore, and most obliging in communicating information, and granting 
access to his valuable library.

posterity for divers generations possessed ye said office and lands. 
Now ye forsaid Richard being, as vald seinie, touched with corn- 
punctione for ye safty of hes soule, according to the custorne of 
these tymes, did found this Abbey of Kilvinnen, in testimony of 
hes repentance ; and first of all did bulde ye queir or cancell of ye 
said Abbey Church, endowing it with divers lands, as namely, the 
the 80 lb. land of Kilvinnen, after this tennor, Damus forrestam 
nostram de Kilvinen, ibidem deo servientibus ad pascendum por- 
cos eorum et ad excindenda ligna ad constructionem Monasterii, 
una cum decimis tergorum tarn cervorum quam damarum euisdem 
forrestae. Also, Alicia Loncaster, vifFe to ye said Sir Richard, 
with consent of her said husband, dottes, in puram et perpetuam 
eliraosinam the land of Bytth, Batth, and Threppe-wood to ye said 
Monastery. Item, Dorathea de Morvil, daughter to ye said Sir 
Richard, and vyffe to Philippus de Horssey, accomplished ye fa- 
brick of ye said monastery, and hes sone, Dominus Valterus de 
Horssey, confirms to them ye same, and ye said foundatione, with 
ye donations and mortifications thereto belonging, is confirmed by 
Pope Honorius the 2. An°. 2"°. pontificatus sui. These dona- 
tions and foundatons ar also confirmed by King Alexander III.; 
as also by Jocelinus Dei Gratia humilis Glasguensis Ecclesiae 
Minister Auctoritate Episcopali, &amp;c. The reveneus of this ab- 
bey ver grate, and maney by over and above their proper lands. 
The founder therof. Sir Richard Morvill, layes interrid in the 
new cemetery of this church, under a tome of lymestone, framed 
coffin-vayes, of old polished vorke, without any superscriptioune or 
epitaphe. The structure of this monastery wes solid and grate, 
all of freestone cutte ; the church faire and staitly, after ye mo- 
dell of yat of Glasgow, vith a fair steeple of 7 score foote of 
height, zet standing where I my selve did see it." 

It is difficult to suppose that Pont, who refers in another part 
of his work to " old records of ye monastery of Kilvinnen," and 
here quotes the original charter of De Morville to the monks, 
should yet be mistaken as to the individual member of that family 
who founded the abbey. If the common accounts, however, of the 
reign of Malcolm IV. are to be relied on, it closed in ] 165, and 
consequently he could not receive the murderer of Thomas a 
Becket, for that prelate was not slain till 1170. His murderers 
we are told, retired at first to Knaresborough in Yorkshire, which 
belonged to De Morville; from whence they repaired to Rome

for absoliilion, and, being admitted to penance by Alexander III., 
were sent by the orders of that Pontiff to Jerusalem, and passed 
the remainder of their lives upon the Black Mountain, in the se- 
veral acts of austerity and mortification. Pont says that the grants 
of the De Morville family to Kilwinning were-" confirmed by Pope 
Honorius 11. 2"". pontificatus sui;" but the death of that Pon- 
tiff, according to Mosheim, Vol. ii. p. 393, happened in U30. 
In Morton's Monastic Annals of Teviotdale p. 290, the mur- 
derer of Thomas a Becket is said to have been the uncle of Huo-h 
de Morville, Constable of Scotland, whose family became extinct 
1196 Do. p. 59. It is highly improbable, indeed, that a sacri- 
legious assassin should have been welcomed by the Scottish mo- 
narch, and invested with lands and authority, at a period when the 
power of the Church of Rome had reached so great a height. It 
is possible, however, that Richard de Morville, son of Hugh, Con- 
stable of Scotland, may have founded the Abbey of Kilwinning in 
the latter part of the twelfth century, and that Pont, misled by 
that name, attributed the work to the murderer of Becket, and re- 
presented it as the itonement made to the Church for his crime. 
The date 1140 is adopted by the learned author of " Caledonia;" 
but he does not give his authority, and the matter is involved in 
some obscurity in consequence of the loss of the chartulary. 

Though the founder and the date of the foundation be thus 
uncertain, it is known that the abbey was richly endowed by dif- 
ferent members of the De Morville family. Successive monarchs 
and noblemen, also, " for the health of their souls," and some- 
times for relief to the souls of their ancestors, contributed by their 
pious benefactions to increase its revenues. The estates belong- 
ing to it included nearly the whole land in the parish of Kilwin- 
ning, and various properties in the parishes of Dairy, Beilh, and 
Kilmarnock. At the Reformation, the revenue of the monastery, 
exclusive of these property lands, amoimted to L. 880, 3s. 4d. 
Scots; 67 chalders, 9 bolls, 3 firlots of meal; 14 chaiders, 1 boll, 
3 firlots, 3 pecks of bear ; 8 bolls 1 firlot of wheat ; 4 hogsheads 
of wine; 13 stirks; 140 capons; 100 hens; 268 cheeses; and 9 
fathoms of a peat stack. To the abbey belonged the patronages 
and teinds of the following parishes, subject to the burden of sti- 
pends for the regular clergy, viz. Kilwinning, Irvine, Kilmarnock, 
Loudoun, Dairy, Ardrossan, Kilbirnie, West Kilbride, Beith,

ham; Dumbarton and Kilmaronock, in Dumbartonshire; South 
and North Knapdale, in Argyll ; Kilmory and Kilbride, in the 
Island of Arran. 

The monks of Kilwinning were originally brought from Kelso, 
and were called Tyronenses, from Tyron, in the diocese of Char-- 
tres, where their order was first settled under St Bernard. It 
would appear that the usual artifices by which superstition was 
encouraged and confirmed in the Roman Catholic church, were 
not neglected by the occupants of this monastery. The fountains 
which had been blessed by St Winning continued in high repute, 
and one of them was believed to give warning of the approach of 
war, by flowing with blood on such occasions. R. Hoveden and 
Benedictus Abbas relate a portent of this kind as having occurred 
in the year 1184. " In eadem vero ebdomada qua rex in Anglia 
applicuit, quidam fons aquse vivae, juxta ecclesiam sancti vinlni, 
in occidentalibus partibus terrae regis Scotiae, infra Cuninham, non 
longe a Castello de Irevin, mutatus in sanguinem, manavit puro 
sanguine per octo dies et totidem noctes sine intermissione. Et 
dicebant indiginee quod simile portentum ibidem contingere solebat 
contra eff'usionem sanguinis. Sed numquam antea tam diu mana- 
vit ibi sanguinis manatio." This fact was mentioned by Lord 
Hailes, among the miscellaneous occurrences in the first volume 
of his Annals of Scotland. He was, in consequence, accused of 
credulity by the critics ; and, in a subsequent edition of his work, 
he declares, that " the author must still remain under that impu- 
tation, for he cannot submit to acknowledge that he does not be- 
lieve that a fountain, near Kilwinning, ran blood for eight days 
and eight nights, without intermission." A recent occurrence 
tends to prove the truth of the story, and to vindicate the stubborn 
faith of the learned Lord. In 1826, when the square or green, 
in the town of Kilwinning, to the west of the monastery, wasljeing 
levelled, the workmen came upon an old leaden pipe, about an 
inch in diameter, which ran from the walls of the building, in the 
direction of a fine spring, now called Kyles Well. This pipe 
had a considerable descent, and could not have been used for the 
purpose of drawing water from tiie well to the abbey. Through 
it, therefore, in all probability, blood, or some liquid resembling 
It, had been caused to flow into the fountain, and thus the credu-

lity of the people was imposed upon, by the appearance of a mi- 
racle, which served to enhance the fame of the monastery, and 
the power of its priesthood. 

Few of the abbots of Kilwinning attained to much celebrity, or 
are noticed in history. One of them swore fealty to King Edward 
in the year 1296, and another, more patriotic, fell, with°his sove- 
reign, on the fatal field of Flodden. The last of the order, Gavin 
Hamilton, was the most distinguished. He was frequently em- 
ployed, by Queen Mary and her party, in offices of great' trust 
and responsibility. In 1566, he was admitted an extraordinary 
Lord of Session, on the Queen's letter. He appeared in her 
cause at the battle of Langside, and was among the commissioners 
at York, in 1568, for settling disputes between Mary and Eliza- 
beth. In 1571, he was declared a rebel, in a Parliament held by 
the Regent Lennox, and, in the same year, lost his life in a con- 
flict, at Restalrig, near Edinburgh, between the Earl of Morton 
and the Queen's party. 

Gavin Hamilton, and his immediate predecessors in office, fore- 
seeing the fall of the Roman Catholic Church, considerably di- 
lapidated the revenues of the abbey, by conferring grants of its 
lands on their friends or relations. What remained at the Re- 
formation was annexed, with all other church lands in the country, 
to the Crown. The King gave the office of commendator to 
Alexander Cunninghame, third son of Alexander, commonly cal- 
led the good Earl of Glencairn. He was bound to pay the sala- 
ries of the reformed teachers, in the parishes that held of the ab- 
bey, but appears to have been unwilling to recognize this obliga- 
tion ; for, in 1581, he was denounced and put to the horn, by 
John Boyd, "reider at Kilmarnock," for non-payment of his stipend. 
Imitating the example of the last Popish abbots, he conferred the 
estate of Mountgreenan, a valuable part of the abbey lands, on 
his son Alexander, in whose family it remained for several gene- 
rations. In 1592, the whole remaining abbacy, or halydome, was 
erected into a temporal lordship, in favour of William Melville 
of Raith, then commendator, who soon after transferred his rights 
to Hugh, fifth Earl of Eglinton. By charter from the Crown, in 
1603, these possessions were confirmed to the Eglinton family, in 
whose hands they still remain. 

In 1560, the Estates of Scotland passed an " act for demolishing 
such cloisters and abbey churches as were not yet pulled down." 
The work of havoc was intrusted in the western Lowlands, to the 



Kilwinning. 



821 



Earl of Glencairn, who, mindful of the dictum of Knox, " pull down 
the nests, and the rooks will fly away," destroyed that stately and 
splendid fabric, whose elegant remains still silently point to the sky. 
A part of the Abbey church was afterwards repaired and fitted up as 
a place of Presbyterian worship. It continued in use till 1775, when 
it was removed, and the present parish church was built on its site. 
The " fair steiple," which Timothy Pont did see, remained till 
1814, when it fell from natural decay. It was a huge square tower, 
32 feet on each side, and 103 feet high. The following year, a 
beautiful tower about the same height, and 28 feet square, was 
erected on the same situation, and separate from the church. The 
south gable of the transept, and one of its finely proportioned 
arches, a Saxon gateway, and some mouldering walls, are the only 
indications and memorials now extant of the once splendid results 
of superstitious piety and Italian art. 

The following is a list of the ministers of Kilwinning from the 
time of the Reformation : 

1. William Kilpatrick. In the " Register of ministers and their 
Stipends sen theyeir of God 1567," his stipend is said to be L.80, 
and in the « Buik of Assignationis of the Ministeris and Reidaris 
stipendis" for the year 157G, it is given as L. 100, with the kirk- 
land of Kilwinning. A " reidare" at Kilwinning was at the same 
time allowed a stipend of" L.20, but without kirkland." 

2. Alexander Wryttoun. In 1598, he subscribes an admission 
in favour of Mr Alexander Campbell to the kirk uf Ardrossan. In 
1606, he was infeft in a house in Kilwinnino-,

3. David Barclay is mentioned as minister and parson of Kil- 
winning in 1609. 

4. John Glassford, whose name occurs in the records of the 
regality of Kilwinning in 1619. He is mentioned in the preface 
to Fergusson's Sermons as one of the " eminent, learned, and 
pious men" who had laboured among the congregation at Kilwin- 
ning. 

5. Robert Baillie, afterwards the celebrated Principal of the 
University of Glasgow, and author, besides other works, of those 
letters and journals which throw so much light on the history of 
bis own times. In 1622, he received Episcopal orders from Arch- 
bishop Law of Glasgow, and became tutor to the son of the Earl 
of Eglinton, by whom he was presented to the living of Kilwin- 
ning. The exact period of his incumbency here is not ascertain-

ed. In 1626, he was admitted a regent in the College of Glas- 
gow, and, having opposed he new ecclesiastical arrangements of

Irvine in the famous General Assembly of 1638, 

6. James Fergusson, of the family of Kilkerran, esteemed by 
his contemporaries as a man of great piety and learning. He was 
invited to be Professor of Divinity in the University of Glasgow, 
but modestly refused. His works are, an " Exposition of the Epistle 
to the Galatians, Ephesians," &amp;c. and a volume of sermons, de- 
livered at Kilwinning in 1652, entitled, « A Brief Refutation of 
the Errors of Toleration, Erastianism, Independency, and Separa- 
tion." This work was published after his death. He died about 
the year 1666. 

7. Ralph Rogers. Under the first indulgence in 1669, he was 
admitted to Kilwinning, having previously been one of the minis- 
ters of Glasgow. He was translated in 1684, but to what office 
is not ascertained. 

8. George Meldrum was admitted in 1688. He was chosen to 
be Professor of Divinity in the University of Glasgow. On the 
25th March 1691, Principal Dunlop appeared at the Presbytery 
of Irvine, and urged them to proceed to his translation. In the 
meantime, he received a call to be one of the ministers of Edin- 
burgh, which he accepted. He edited the sermons of his prede- 
cessor, Mr Fergusson, and his preface is dated Edinburgh, 1692. 

9. George Chalmers was admitted in 1696; and in 17 J 7, be- 
came Principal of King's College, Aberdeen. 

10. Alexander Fergusson was admitted in 1721, and died 1770. 
A few years before his death, he was prosecuted for heresy by 
James M'Connell, town- drummer of Beith, an account of which 
process may be seen in the Scots Magazine of the time. 

11. Thomas Pollock was admitted in 1770, and died in 1798. 
He was author of the former Statistical Account. 

12. William Ritchie, D.D. previously minister of Tarbolton, 
was admitted in 1798, was translated to Glasgow in 1802, and 
thence to the High Church, Edinburgh, and to the Divinity 
Chair in the University of that city.

Masonry. — The art of executing very large and magnificent 
buildings in timber frame-work was carried to high perfection in 
the northern countries of Europe during the tenth, eleventh, and 
twelfth centuries. Owing, however, to the perishable nature of the 
materials, and to accidents by fire, these buildings were frequently 
either destroyed, or reduced to a state of extreme decay; so that 
the ruinous state of the ecclesiastical edifices in the northern parts 
of Europe became a serious subject of inquiry at Rome, and mea- 
sures were taken to obviate the grievance. The Pope created se- 
veral corporations of Roman and Italian architects and artisans, 
with high and exclusive privileges, especially with a power of set- 
tling the rates and prices of their labour by their own authority, 
and without being controlled by the municipal laws of the country 
where they worked. To the various northern countries, where 
the churches had fallen into a state of decay, were these artists 
deputed. In consequence of the exclusive privileges conferred 
upon them, they assumed to themselves the name of Free Masons, 
and under this title became famous throughout Europe. These 
corporations, from their first origin, possessed the power of taking 
apprentices, and admitting into their body such masons as they 
approved of in the countries where their works were carried on. 
A party of these foreign artisans, aided by such workmen as they 
found in Scotland qualified to join them, are said to have con- 
structed the monastery of Kilwinning. The architect or master 
mason, who superintended and carried on the work, was chosen 
master mason of the meetings of the brethren all over Scotland. 
He gave rules for their conduct at these meetings, and decided 
finally in appeals from all the other lodges in the kingdom. From 
this period, down to the fifteenth century, little is known of the 
history of masonry. It is acknowledged that Kilwinning continued 
to be the head-quarters of the order. In the notes to a French 
poem, La Maconnerie, published at Paris in 1820, p. 151, it is 
said, that " Jacques Lord Stewart recus dans sa loge a Kilwin en 
Ecosse, en 1286, les Comtes de Glocester et Ulster, I'un Anglois, 
I'autre Irlandois." King James I. of Scotland, eminently distin- 
guished for his knowledge and taste in polite literature and in the 
fine arts, not long after his return from England, patronized the 
mother lodge of Kilwinning, and presided as grand master, till 

♦ P. F. Tytlei's Hist, of Scotland, Vol. ii. pp. mb, 396.

he settled an annual salary, to be paid by every master mason in 
Scotland to a grand master, chosen by the brethren, and approved 
by the Crown. It was required that this grand master should be 
nobly born, or a clergyman of high rank and character. He had 
his deputies in the diflFerent counties and towns of Scotland. Every 
new brother paid him a fee at entrance. He was empowered to 
regulate and determine such matters in dispute, between the 
founders and builders of churches and monasteries, as it would 
have been improper to bring before a court of law. King James 
11. conferred the office of grand master on William Sinclair, Earl 
of Orkney, and Baron of Roslin. By another deed of the same 
King, this office was made hereditary in this very ancient and il- 
lustrious family. Earl William and his successors. Barons of 
Roslin, held their head courts, or, in the style of masonry, as- 
sembled their grand lodges at Kilwinning. The mother lodge 
continued in possession of the highest authority, and granted char- 
ters of erection to other lodges, till the year 1736, when the Lord 
of Roslin, hereditary grand master, assembled thirty-two lodges 
in Edinburgh, and resigned all right or title which he possessed, 
or his successors might claim, to preside over the masonic order 
throughout Scotland. His resignation being accepted, the Grand 
Lodge of Scotland was constituted, consisting of representatives 
from other lodges throughout the kingdom, iu whom was vested 
the right of legislating and of granting new charters, or confirming 
old ones, for the whole order, for which purposes a general meet- 
ing is held, and office-bearers are elected annually. This usur- 
pation was resisted for a time by the Kilwinning brethren, who 
continued to hold independent meetings, and to grant charters 
as formerly, till the year 1807, when the dispute was amicably 
settled, and the mother lodge relinquished her ancient privileges, 
joining the general association, along with the lodges which held 
of her.f 

Archery.\ — It is well known that, in former times, the bow and 
arrow were used in war throughout the whole of Europe. By one 
or more of the old acts of the Scotch Parliament, the young men 
in every parish were strictly commanded to practise archery for an 
hour or two every Sunday, after Divine service. After the inven- 
tion of fire-arms, archery was laid aside, as no longer useful and 
necessary in war. Though for this reason it was disused in most

other places in Scotland, it has been practised here as an elegant 
and manly amusement, almost without any interruption, to the pre- 
sent day. At the same time, the laws and usages of the Company 
the term used for the society, are known, and that too very im- 
perfectly, only by tradition, prior to the year 1488. This date is 
acknowledged and rendered authentic by a minute in the records, 
dated September 1688. This minute is signed by a number of 
gentlemen of the most respectable characters. From this time, 
archery has been practised annually, at a certain stated time of the 
year, generally in the month of June. The species of archery in 
use here is of two kinds. The one is a perpendicular mark, cal- 
led a papingoe. The papingoe is a bird known in heraldry. It is 
on this occasion, cut in wood, fixed in the end of a pole, and placed 
about 120 feet high, on the steeple of the monastery. The archer 
who shoots down this mark is honoured with the title of Captain 
of the Papingoe. He is master of the ceremonies of the succeed- 
ing year, sends cards of invitation to the ladies, gives them a ball 
and supper, and transmits his honours to posterity by a medal, with 
suitable devices, appended to a silver arrow. The prize from 1488 
to 1688 was a sash, or as it was called a benn. This was a piece 
of taffeta or Persian, of different colours, chiefly red, green, white, 
and blue, and not less in value than L. 20 Scotch. This honour- 
able badge was worn by the captain, which he kept, and produced 
another of equal value the following year. At the revival of arch- 
ery in 1688, there was substituted a piece of plate, which conti- 
nued to be given by every captain till 1723. The other kind of 
shooting is for prizes at butts, point-blank distance, about twenty- 
six yards. The prize at butts is some useful or ornamental piece 
of plate, given annually to the Society by the senior surviving 
archer. 

Tournament. — In the month of August 1839, a celebrated tour- 
nament was held at Eglinton castle by the present Earl of Eglin- 
ton and Wintoun. Accounts of it have been published, with picto- 
rial illustrations of the armour and costume worn on the occasion. 
This romantic attempt to revive the sports and pageantry of ancient 
times was made on a magnificent scale, and it is supposed that 
50,000 or 60,000 persons, of all the varied ranks of society, were 
assembled to witness the gorgeous spectacle. Though the park 
was thrown open to this promiscuous multitude, no wanton mis- 
chief was done to a single object, nor was an intoxicated individual 
seen within the gates. The tournament was held during two days ; 



826 



AYRSHIRK. 



but our limits forbid us to enter into any detail of its splendid 
scenes, either on the tented field, or in the halls of the castle 
where so many of the fair and brave of " high degree" were as- 
sembled to hold high festival. The courtesy and liberality of the 
noble Lord of the tournament were universally felt and acknow- 
ledged. 

Parochial Registers — The earliest minute of session is dated 
12th March 1656, since which time, with the exception of a few 
intervals, they appear to have been regularly recorded. The re- 
cord of baptisms begins 27th April 1669, and that of proclama- 
tions, 14th July 1676, and both are continued, with few interrup- 
tions, to the present day. In recent times, the register of births 
IS far from being complete, and there is none of deaths or burials. 

Modern Buildings, 8fc.—T\xe chief of these is Eglinton Castle, 
a large and handsome house, suitable for the residence of the mu- 
nificent and hospitable family to whom it belongs. It was built in 
the end of last century by Hugh, twelfth Earl of Eglinton. The 
park in which it stands is spacious and well-wooded, and stocked 
with deer. The gardens are extensive and beautiful. There is an 
elegant mansion at Mountgreenan, built about thirty years ago by 
Robert Glasgow, Esq. Monkcastle and Ashgrove are also'' fur- 
nished with suitable residences. There are four mills for grinding 
corn, and three saw-milis in the parish.

Of the rural population, about 800 reside in collier villages and 
hamlets. 

The chief causes of the great increase since 1831, are he for- 
mation of the Glasgow, Ayr, and Kilmarnock Railway, and the ex- 
tension of the collieries in the imnediate neighbourhood of Kil- 
winning, and at Fergushill, where a village containing upwards of 



KILWINNING.

1200 people has sprung up within the last few years. There are 
at present a considerable number of labourers employed in the 
construction of the Kilmarnock branch of the railway, who are not 
permanently connected with the parish ; and when it is finished, 
the whole population will probably not amount to more than 
5000. 

The number of proprietors whose annual rental is L.50 or up- 
wards, is 35. Of these, the only persons of independent for- 
tune resident, are the Right Honourable the Earl of Eglinton and 
Wintoun; William Millar, Esq. of Monkcastle ; George Crighton, 
Esq. ; and Miss Bowman of Ashgrove. 

There are three individuals deaf and dumb in the parish, two 
fatuous, and two blind. 

There is no smuggling. Poaching is carried on to a small ex- 
tent. 

IV. — Industry. 
About one-third of the whole population are employed in agri- 
culture; about one-fifth in mining; probably another fifth are la- 
bourers, shopkeepers, and artisans ; and the remainder are hand- 
loom weavers. A great proportion of the females in the town sew 
the Ayrshire needlework, at which they can make a tolerably com- 
fortable living. 

Agricvlture.— The farms generally are very small, many of 
them not more than 50 acres. The average extent may be stated 
at 80 acres. But from the character of the soil, and the extreme- 
ly undulating nature of the surface, the land is not well adapted 
for large farms. They are cultivated chiefly by the farmers them- 
selves and their families, — both those which are rented, and such 
as belong to the occupants, of which there are a considerable 
number. 

About one-third or one-fourth is generally under crop. The 
rest is in pasture. There is a considerable extent of moss in the 
upper district of the parish, which can scarcely be regarded as 
improvable, as the soil is too poor to yield a profitable return for 
the capital that must necessarily be expended. I cannot specify 
the number of acres under wood, but they must amount to a good 
many hundreds, and some of the timber in Eglinton Park is very 
fine. The kinds of trees that chiefly abound are Scotch fir, 
larch, ash, elm, and oak. There are many very large old beeches 
at Eglinton, but this species is not now planted. The manage- 
ment of the wood is upon the whole good. 



-J 



828 AYRSHIRE. 

The average rent per acre of arable land is L.l, 15s. The 
average rent of grazing a cow or ox is L.4, lOs.;' a ewe and 
lamb, L.l. 

The farm-servants are of two descriptions,— those who live and 
board m the family of their master, whose -wages average L 16 
per annum,— and those who are married, and live on, or in the 
neighbourhood of, the farm on which they are employed. The 
latter have a house and garden provided for them, receive b" bolls 
of oatmeal, 4 bolls of potatoes, their coals driven, and L. 14 in 
money, amounting in all to L.25 or L.30 per annum. They are 
generally well treated, and very comfortable, though few in num- 
ber. Female servants engaged for the dairy generally get, in ad- 
dition to their board, L.iO yearly. When men are employed for 
a short period only, they are paid 9s. a week in winter, and l-2s. 
in summer. Masons, carpenters, and other artisans usually re- 
ceive 15s. weekly. 

Live-StocL—There are not many sheep kept in the parish. 
The common breed is the black-faced, but there are also a few 
of the Leicester and Southdown kinds. The cattle, almost uni- 
versally, are of the Ayrshire Dunlop kind. The horses are of 
the Clydesdale breed. Much attention has been paid to the im- 
provement of the sheep and horses, with considerable success. 
But the cattle, though better kept than they were twenty years 
ago, have become inferior to what they then were. 

The general course of husbandry pursued, especially in the 
poorer soils, is to take two white crops and six years' pasture. 
While in richer land, they only graze for the space of four, three, 
or two years, when the soil will admit of it. This was the plan 
universally followed, and the land was never cleaned, until, seve- 
ral years ago, green-cropping was introduced, and on the richer 
soils the tenants now observe a four year's rotation, viz. oats, green 
crop, wheat, and grass. A great part of the parish, from being 
an extremely tenacious, wet, and unproductive clay, is unsuitable 
for this method of cultivation. It is all capable, however, of vast 
improvement by draining, liming, and manuring, and much is doing 
in this way. Lideed, the whole of this district, at the present rate, 
will be tile-drained in ten years. There are the greatest facilities 
for improvement, as there are lime and tile-works in the parish, 
and the leases generally are for the term of nineteen years. The 
inclosures are in good order, as the tenant is bound to keep them

in repair, but the farm-steadings, for the most part, are ill-planned, 
limited in accommodation, and inconvenient. 

Quarries and Mines, — The coal-mines are, Doura, Fergushill, 
Redstone, and Eglinton, which employ 220 miners, whose wages 
are, for each man, 4s. per day. The price of coal at the pit 
month, is 5s. per twenty cwt. From these collieries are exported 
annually about 50,000 tons at the harbour of Ardrossan, the 
greater portion of them to Ireland, some to the Mediterranean, 
and a few to the Highlands. There are two limestone, and one 
sandstone quarry, at which a considerable number of men are em- 
ployed. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 
The nearest market-town to Kilwinning is Irvine, which lies, 
towards the south, at the distance of three miles. 

The male inhabitants of Kilwinning are chiefly employed in 
weaving and mining; the females in sewing. The only individuals 
found necessary for keeping the peace are one of the county 
police and a sheriff-officer. The town has a fine and picturesque 
appearance from several points of view. It is situated on the 
banks of the Garnock, about four miles from its mouth, is sur- 
rounded by a considerable quantity of wood, and receives additional 
beauty from the ruins of the abbey, and a very handsome modern 
tower. The higher parts of it also command an extensive and 
varied prospect, including the bay of Ayr, and the hills of Arran, 
as well as the neighbouring country. The town itself, however, has 
not much to recommend it. It consists chiefly of one narrow street, 
about a mile in length, but the two portions at the extremities are 
somewhat detached ; that towards the west is called the Byres, 
because, it is believed, the monks kept their cattle there; and the 
eastern has got the name of the Corsehill, from its being the place 
where they erected the cross. 

The principal villages are, Doura, Fergushill, and Dalgarven, 
The two first contain each upwards of 200 inhabitants, and the 
third nearly that number. 

For the accommodation of the public, there is a post-office, and 
the parish is intersected, in all directions, by roads, eleven miles 
of which are turnpike-roads. The rest are kept up jointly by the 
proprietors and tenantry. Formerly, there were several stage- 
coaches, which passed through Kilwinning to- Glasgow and other 
places, but they have all been given up since the opening of the 
Glasgow and Ayr Railway, about two years ago, which affords the

greatest facilities, both for travelling and the conveyance of goods, 
and farm produce. It passes through the west end of the town,' 
where a station-house has been erected, and where the branch 
to Ardrossan also meets the chief line. The branch to Kil- 
marnock, which is in the process of formation, and is expected 
to be completed in the spring of 1843, also passes throuah the 
pansh, withm a mile of the town ; and it was originally intended 
to have a short off-shot branch, from the nearest point,"stretchincT 
directly down to the Kilwinning station, to facilitate communica 
tion between Kilmarnock and Ardrossan. But this proposal has 
been given up in the meantime. Should the railway, however, better 
remunerate the proprietors, this plan very probably Will be carried 
into execution. There is also another railway, with a single line 
of rails, from the Doura and Fergushill collieries, which meets 
with the Ardrossan branch of the Glasgow and Ayr railway, about 
two miles from the harbour. By this railway the coal is conveyed 
for exportation. It has been in operation several years. 

Ecclesiastical State — The parish church is situated in the mid- 
dle of the town, and is the most convenient locality for the popu- 
lation generally, as considerably more than one-half live within a 
mile of it ; and although it be little more than that distance from 
the western boundary of the parish, none of the parishioners live 
above five miles from it. It was built in 1775, and is in a good 
state of repair. When erected, neither the area nor galleries were 
seated, and they continued in this state until towards the close of 
last century. It accommodates 1 030 people. None of the sit- 
tings are free, but they are seldom let for more than 2s. 6d. each, 
yearly. The seats set apart for the communicants, at the cele- 
bration of the sacrament, are placed at the disposal of the session, 
who let them at a low rate ; and the Right Honourable the Earl 
of Eglinton, and the Lady Montgomery, who are the principal 
heritors, give the proceeds of theirs to the session also, for the be- 
nefit of the poor. 

The manse was built in the year 1773, and has since 
undergone several repairs. The glebe contains about 6 acres, 
but this includes the garden, and site for the manse and 
offices. It is worth about L.4 per acre. The stipend is 17 clial- 
ders, and L.IO for communion elements. By the Royal Commis- 
sioners' Report, the average stipend in money for the period of 
seven years previous to 1834, was L.266, 12s.

In consequence of the extent and populousness of the parish, the 
present incumbent has, for several years, kept an assistant, who is 
supported jointly by himself and the patron. 

There are two meeting-houses in the town, one of which is con- 
nected with the United Secession, and the other with the Origi- 
nal Seceders. The congregations attending them are not large. 
The minister of the former congregation receives L. 80 per an- 
tium, that of the latter L.lOO, which sums are derived from seat- 
rents and other voluntary contributions. 

Divine service in the Established Church is generally very well 
attended, although a large portion of the inhabitants altogether 
neglect Divine ordinances. The number of communicants may 
be stated at nearly 1000. 

Education. — There are 8 schools in the parish, but only one of 
them is a parochial school. The others are all unendowed, and 
are supported almost entirely by school-fees. The branches of 
education generally taught are, English reading, writing, arithme- 
tic, and geography, and in addition to these, in the parochial school, 
instructions are given in Latin, mathematics, book-keeping, and draw- 
ino-. The maximum salary is allowed to the schoolmaster, and a 
house is provided for him. Two of the other teachers are in 
the town. The others are connected with collieries, or are in 
small hamlets in different parts of the parish. The school-rooms 
have generally been built by subscription. Near the village of 
Doura, a larae school-room and a house for the teacher, with a 
play-ground and garden attached to it, have been erected at the 
sole expense of the Earl of Eglinton and Winton. 

The average attendance on all the schools put together is 
about 550, and there are few in the parish who have not received 
instruction in reading and writing, and the other elements of a 
common education. It may also be mentioned, that there are 
six Sabbath schools, which are attended by upwards of 500 chil- 
dren. 

Charitable and other Institutions.— There are four Friendly So- 
cieties in the parish, one for males, and the others for females. 
The first was formed in 1830, by the union of several that had 
existed previously. The rest have been in existence for the pe- 
riods of twenty-four, twenty-six, and twenty- seven years. The 
members of the Male Friendly Society amounted at its commence- 
fment to 450, in 1840 to 440, and at present to the same number. 



832 AYRSHIRE. 



They pay two different rates, and receive a proportionate allow- 
ance. These rates are twopence and threepence a-week. Those 
who paid twopence for some time after the institution of the Socie- 
ty, received 6s. weekly when confined to bed, 4s. when walking 
about, but unable from sickness or infirmity to support themselvef 
Such as paid threepence were allowed, in the one case, 9s. and 
in the other, 6s. As it was found, however, that the income did 
not meet the expenditure, the rates of aliment have since been re- 
duced to 5s. and 3s. for the one rate of payment, and 7s. 6d and 
4s. per week for the other. The funds at present amount to near- 
ly L.500. 

The Female Society, which was instituted in 1817, had, in 1820 
70 members ; in 1830, 80 ; in 1840, 120. That which was formi 
ed m 1818, had, in 1820, 160 members ; in 1830, 329; in 1840, 
537. The remaining one, which was begun in 1820, had at first 
160 members; in 1830, 346 ; and in 1840, 309. The rate of 
payment to these associations is one penny per week. The allow- 
ance granted to those connected with the first is 3s. when in bed, 
and Is. 6d. when unable to work. It has scarcely any permanent 
or sinking fund. The aliment given by the other two' is 5s. when 
the members are confined to bed, and 2s. 6ci. when incapacitated 
from following their usual vocations. They have considerable 
funds, although, from the depressed state of trade, and other 
causes, they are gradually diminishing. 

Savings Bank.— khoui two years ago, a Savings Bank was in- 
stituted ; but, as there is a branch of the Commercial Bankino- 
Company's Bank in the town where small sums are received, it 
has not hitherto done much business. The investments amounted 
the first year to L.243, 12s. 3d., and there was drawn L.83, 17s. 
6d. The second year, there was invested L.75, 12s. 4d.; drawn 
L.44, 10s. The investments are generally made by tradesmen in 
town, and, in some cases, by servants ; frequently by those who, 
many years ago, had made a little money, and comparatively sel- 
dom by young people. The weaving part of the population, and 
those residing in the country, seldom make any deposits, — the 
latter from an idea that their money is not secure. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
on the poor roll during the last ten years, is 97. The average sum 
allotted to each annually is L.2, 8s. 8d. There are also occasional 
disbursements, which vary considerably in different years ; but the

833 



average may be stated at L.120 per annum. The average amount 
derived from collections for the last ten years is L.65, 18s. 2d. 
There are also two farms placed under the management of the 
session for the benefit of the poor, — one of them from a mortifica- 
tion, the annual rental of which is L. 150; and another which was 
bought from the poor's fund at a time when the income far ex- 
ceeded the expenditure, at least as far back as the beginning of 
last century, the rental of which is L.52, 10s. There were like- 
wise other three mortifications, of L.lOO, L.80, and L.50 respec- 
tively, made by benevolent and charitable individuals, the interest 
of which was to be distributed among the poor of the parish of 
Kilwinning. As it was found necessary, however, to borrow money 
in order to meet the necessary annual expenditure, these have 
been appropriated in the meantime, — for the heritors and session 
are empowered to sell one of the farms, and can thus make good 
the mortifications at any time. The only other available funds 
are L.12 or L. 15 annually, derived from seat-rents, and a small 
sum for proclamations, &amp;c. There has hitherto been no parochial 
assessment ; but, as the sources of income are not sufficient to 
meet the necessary outlay, and the population is so rapidly increas- 
ing, it is not probable that this can be long avoided. 

It may be remarked, that, while the people generally prefer 
supporting themselves without relief, they do not appear to have 
any strong feeling against it, and few of them consider it degrading. 

Fairs. — There are two fairs annually, — Bell's Day, generally 
kept on the first Wednesday of November, and St Winning's day, 
on the first day of February. The former was originally intended 
as a market for cattle, the latter for horses ; but no such distinc- 
tion is now observed, and horses and cattle are sold at both. 

Inns, Alehouses, c. — The number of houses or shops in the 
parish licensed to sell exciseable liquors is 27. Their effect on: 
the morals of the people, especially of the miners and inhabitants 
of the town, is of the most pernicious description. 

Fuel. — The fuel almost universally used is coal, which is pro- 
cured at the different collieries in the parish at the low rate of 5s. 
per ton at the pit. Peat is also burned, to a small extent, in the 
upper district, in the immediate vicinity of the moss. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 
The changes most worthy of notice in the state of the parish 
since the writing of the former Statistical Account are, the opening 
of several additional collieries, the improvements adopted in agricul- 
ture, the planting of a considerable quantity of wood, and the vast 
AYR. 3g.

increase of the population, which, since that period, has more 
than doubled. There have, for a long period, been considera- 
ble facilities for internal communication ; but the opening of the 
Glasgow and Ayr Railway, with branch lines to Ardrossan and 
Kilmarnock, affords the greatest advantages for intercourse 
witli Glasgow, as well as the surrounding country, and must 
raise the value of property. The inhabitants are, we believe, 
more industrious than they were towards the end of last century ; 
but they are also more extravagant both in regard to their cloth- 
ing and mode of living, and it is to be feared, less contented with 
their circumstances. Scarcity of work, which sometimes occurs, 
and constant fluctuations in the price paid for it, are unfavourable 
to the interests and welfare of the manufacturing population. 
The desire for luxuries is, in many instances, too prevalent, and a 
want of prudence, foresight, and economy, often appears. The 
inhabitants of the parish, in general, are intelligent and well in- 
formed, and many of them are exemplary in the discharge of all 
the duties of their station.

PRESBYTERY OF IRVINE, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. NORMAN MACLEOD, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 
Name, — " The name Loudoun," says the writer of the old 
Statistical Account of this parish, " is probably derived from a 
hill in the extremity of the parish called Lowdon from the old 
word low, a fire, don or dun, a hill ;" and from the extensive view 
of the surrounding country which the hill commands, and from 
its being in the immediate vicinity of a Roman camp, it has very 
probably been a station for a signal-fire. Others have suggested 
that the name Loudoun is a corruption of the Gaelic word Lod-dan, 
which signifies marshy ground ; and as the river Irvine, now more 
confined than formerly to the bed which it has hollowed for its 
waters, at no distant period, flooded the low grounds of the parish, 
it is not improbable that the, valley rather than the hill has had 
the honour of giving name to Loudoun. The banking of the 



LOUDOUN. 



835 



river and tile-draining have made this name no longer a descrip- 
tive one; but the memory of the " marshy ground" is kept aUve 
in the title of " Waterhaughs," a farm skirting the Irvine, on the 
Galston side of the valley. 

Figure, Extent. — The figure of the parish approaches nearly to 
that of a right-angled triangle, the base being formed by the river 
Irvine, which, rising in the north-east corner of the parish, flows 
due south for about two miles, dividing Loudoun from Avondale, 
sweeping round Loudoun hill, and pursues a course due west, divid- 
ing the parishes of Loudoun and Galston for about seven miles. 
On the west, north-west, and north, it is bounded by the parishes 
of Kilmarnock, Fenwick, and Eaglesham, the two latter joining it 
among moor-hags and heather. The extent of the parish from east 
to west is about 9 miles. Its greatest breadth towards Eaglesham 
is about 7 ; at the west extremity, it is only about 3. 

Geology, — Dr M'Culloch remarked, that there was no coal 
district in Britain so much distiirbed by trap, or, in miner's lan- 
guage, so " full of troubles," as Ayrshire. The parish of Loudoun 
contains no other minerals than trap, and those belonging to the coal 
formation. A minute account of its geology would be very unpro- 
fitable, as no phenomena hare been observed which are not fami- 
liar to every geologist. 

Loudoun Hill is composed of columnar trap, and forms a por- 
tion of a large trap dike, which, it is said, cuts the whole coal-field 
of Ayrshire in a north-west and south-east direction. 

The coal formation occurs in almost every part of the parish, 
though in most of the upper districts it is so much broken up by 
trap as to be unworkable. The limestone, which is abundant, and 
which is of excellent quality, is extensively wrought. One quar- 
ry, at " the Old Place," consists of a " post" about six feet thicL 
The upper bed is soft and shelly, the lower, hard and splintery. 
The limestone at Howlet burn is about six feet thick. It is wrought 
by mining, and is at present let to the Cessnock Iron Company 
for smelting. The general dip of the limestone is to the south- 
south-west and north-north-east. 

A large coal-field has lately been proven, extending along the 
valley for about two miles from the western boundary of the pa- 
rish. Eight different seams of coal have been already discovered 
in it, varying from one foot to seven feet in thickness. In all, 
27 feet 3 inches. With the exception of two seams, they are all 
workable- The quality is superior. The distance from the mi'- 



83G 



AYRSHIRE. 



face to tlie largest seam is 53 fathoms. The clav ironstone of 
this formation is Hkewise abundant, in some places extending over 
several hundred acres, and near the surface. At the Old Place 
quarry there are four different seams, of 1 foot 8 inches, and 15 
inches in thickness. On the farm of Redding, there are 6ve or 
six seams, in all about three feet thick. 

II — Civil History, 

Historical Events. — Few historical events of any importance 
have occurred in this parish. A spot is yet pointed out at the 
eastern base of Loudoun Hill, as the scene of one of Wallace's 
exploits. The fact of his having attacked and conquered a party 
of English near Loudoun Hill, who were conveying provisions from 
Carlisle to the famished garrison at Ayr, is recorded in all the 
histories of the hero. The remains of a small turf redoubt can 
now be easily traced on the summit of an almost precipitous bank, 
which overhangs the old public road, where it is said Wallace lay 
in ambush during the night, and whence he issued to attack the rich 
convoy in the gray dawn of the morning, while it was entangled 
in the narrow defile. Loudoun Hill has been the centre of more 
than one warlike exploit. The Roman camp, though on the 
Galston side of the Irvine, is almost beneath the shadow of the 
hill; the shouts of Bruce's victorious army have been echoed 
by its gray rocks ; and the watchmen who warned the Covenanters 
of Drumclog which is in its immediate neighbourhood of the 
approach of Claverhouse, were perched upon its summit. 

No public events of any interest occurred in Loudoun until the 
time of the Persecution.. 

" Times, 

 Whose echo rings through Scotland till this hour," 

But many tales of more or less interest, connected with that 
season of trial, are still to be heard from the peasantry. Claver- 
house, Dalyell, and Captain Inglis, have each left behind them 
records of their ignorant and cruel policy in the graves of some 
of the headless martyrs of the Covenant, which are to be seen in 
our church-yards. It may not be out of place to mention one or 
two current anecdotes regarding some of the leaders of "the rising" 
who were connected with Loudoun. 

Captain Nisbet of HardJiill was born upon the present glebe, a 
few hundred yards from the manse. He commanded the Loudoun 
troops at Bothwell, and carried his flag still in good preservation 
in Darvel, safe out of the ill-fated engagement. On the reported 

4 



LOUDOUN. 



837 



approjxcli of Claverhouse to Drumdog, Nisbet was sent for to Hard- 
hill, and arrived in time to head the successful charge of the Cove- 
nanters across the morass. On his way to Drumclog, when passing 
through Darvel, he induced John Morton, the smith, to accompany 
him to the field of battle, where his brawny arm would find suffi- 
cient occupation. John followed Nisbet in the charge. A royal 
dragoon, who was on the ground entangled in the trappings of his 
wounded horse, begged quarter from John, whose arm was uplifted 
to cut him down. The dragoon's life was spared, and he was led 
by the smith as his prisoner to the camp of the Covenanters. But 
the life which was spared on the field of battle was demanded by 
those who saw, in the royal party, not merely cruel persecutors but 
idolatrous Amalekites, whom they were bound in duty to execute. 
The smith declared, that, sooner than give up his prisoner's life, 
he would forfeit his own I The dragoon's life, thus defended by 
the powerful smith, was spared, but the smith was banished from 
the army as a disobedient soldier. The dragoon's sword is now in 
possession of John Morton's representative, Andrew Gebbie in 
Darvel. Captain Nisbet was afterwards executed at the Grass- 
market in Edinburgh, in 1685. His life is in the Scots Worthies. 
The Reverend John Nevay. — His life also is given in the Scots 
Worthies. In Sir James Turner's Memoirs of his own time, 
it is stated that Nevayj then minister of Loudoun, and chaplain 
to David Leslie's army, was the chief instigator of the bloody 
massacre of Dunaverty in Cantyre, "where the whole garrison of 
300 were put to death in cold blood, whose bones may even now 
be seen among the sand banks, on the beach near the fort. — " I 
hope," quoth David after the massacre, " you have had enough of 
blood to day Maister John." Nevay, and thousands who acted 
with him, we believe, had no love for such deeds, but their argu- 
ments were first wrong, then their actions. 

James, second Earl of Loudoun, then Lord Mauchline, was fly- 
ino- for his life, having been, with his father, exempted from the 
general amnesty granted by Cromwell to Scotland. He took re- 
fuge in the farm-steading of the Hag-houses, which formerly stood 
on the rising ground near the lime and coal road, below the wood. 
He had just changed his dress, and put on the clothes of a labour- 

• An autobiography of Captain Nisbet's son is mentioned in Macgavin's edition 
of Howie's Scotch Worthies, p. 479, note, as being in MS., but never published. 
A copy is now before me, printed at Bombay in 1829, and now in the possession of 
Mr A. Brown, shoemaker, Newmills.

ing mail, when some dragoons arrived who had tracked him to the 
house. His being recognized seemed inevitable, when the tenant 
with great presence of mind, struck Lord MauchHne and said, 
« You lazy loon, why do you not go to your work" and in this 
way drove him out before the dragoons, who never imagined he 
would dare so to treat his landlord, and he was thus saved. He 
soon after fled to Holland, and died at Levden, where he was 
buried. 

The Old Tower in Neivmills.~Th\s old tower, itself without any 
history, was the scene of more than one transaction characteristic 
" of the troublous times." This was Captain loglis's head-quar- 
ters when in the district. In one of the expeditions of Inglis's 
troops in the search of conventicles, eight men, who were disco- 
vered praying in the Black-wood, near Kilmarnock, were taken 
prisoners. One of them, it is said, was immediately executed, 
and the soldiers in mockery kicked his head for foot-ball, along 
the Newmills public green  Inglis was about to shoot the others" 
when it was suggested to him that it would be prudent to get a 
written order from Edinburgh for the execution. The seven men, 
in the meantime, were confined in the old tower. But while the 
troop was absent on one of its bloody raids, with the exception of 
a small guard, a man named Browning, from Lan6ne, with others 
who had with him been at Airds Moss, got large sledge hammers 
from the old smithy, still in existence, with which they broke 
open the prison doors, and permitted the Covenanters" to escape. 
John Law, brother-in-law to Captain Nisbet, was shot in this 
exploit, and is buried close to the wall of the tower. The dra- 
goons soon went in pursuit of the prisoners, but they had reached 
the heather, and there no cavalry could pursue them. The sol- 
diers, however, having ascertained that John Smith of Croonan 
had given the runaways food, went to Smith's house, and, meetino- 
him at his own door, shot him dead  Within a short period his 
grave was to be seen in the garden of the old farm-house. 

The Loudoun Family. — The barony of Loudoun belonged, in 
the days of David L, to one Lambrinus, father of James de Lou- 
doun, who got a charter of the barony of Loudoun from Richard 
de Morville, constable of England, also a charter from William 
de Morville, both in the reign of William I. This James left an 
only daughter, Margaret, who married Sir Reginald Craufurd, 
heritable sheriff of Ayrshire. Their great-grand-daughter only

rhild of Hugh Craufui-d, was mother of Sir WilHam Wallace, 
as old Win ton says, 

His father was a manly knight, 
His mother was a lady bright. 

Susanna Craufurd, only child of the Sir Reginald who died in 
1303, and great-griind-danghter of the first Sir Reginald, married 
Sir Duncan Campbell of Lochawe, grandson of Sir Colin Camp- 
bell More of Lochaw, who held the sheriffship of Ayrshire, and 
was the first of the Campbells of Loudoun. The following short 
historical notices of some of their descendants may be mte- 
resting. 

. Sir Andrew Campbell followed King David into England, was 
taken prisoner at the battle of Durham in 1346, and was not re- 
lieved until 1357. His son, 

Sir Husfh, was one of the barons nominated to meet the King 
at Durham, in 1423. His son. 

Sir George, was of the hostages for the ransom of King James I., 
when his Sir George's, annual revenue was estimated at only 300 
merks. He accompanied the Princess Margaret to France in 
1436. 

Sir John succeeded his father. Sir George. A charter was given 
by his wife to support a chapel on Irvine water, in 1451. The 
ruins of this chapel are still seen at Loudoun kirk. 

Sir Matthew promoted the cause of the Reformation. He was 
taken prisoner at Langside, when fighting so rigid was his loyal- 
ty, on the side of Queen Mary. From Sir Matthew's second son, 
who settled in Livonia, and who assumed the surname of Lou- 
doun, the Austrian field-marshal, Laudohn, was descended. 

Sir Hugh, Sir Matthew's eldest son, and tenth Campbell, was 
created a Lord of Parliament, by the title of Baron Loudoun, in 
1601. Sir Hugh had one son and three daughters. The son, 
George, died young. Margaret, his eldest daughter, Baroness 
of Loudoun, succeeded her grandfather in 1622, and married Sir 
John Campbell of Lawers, who was created Earl of Loudoun 
in May 1633. His Lordship was one of the commissioners 
from the Scottish army who settled the pacification of Ber- 
wick in 1639, with Charles I. He sat as a member of the fn- 
mous General Assembly of 1638. He was made Lord Chan- 
cellor in 1642, and died in 1652. He was buried in the vault of 
Loudoun kirk, where, beneath the coffin lid, his face, a few years 
ago, might be seen in perfect preservation. A full account of his

life is given in tlie Scots Worthies. His son, James, as we liave 
already mentioned, was oblired to leave his country during the 
persecution in Charles' II.'s time, and died in Leyden in 1684. 
He married Lady Margaret Montgomery, second daughter of 
Hugh, seventh Earl of Eglinton. His son, " 

Hugh, third Earl, was privy-councillor in 1697. Argyle, writ- 
ing to Lord Carstairs, says of him, " Lord Loudoun, though a 
young man, is an old and noted Presbyterian. His Lordship has 
it in his blood, and he is a mettled young fellow, so that those 
who patronise him will gain honour by him." After the accession 
of Anne, he was appointed one of the commissioners for the treaty 
of Union in 1705. He married Lady Margaret Dalrymple, 
daughter of John, first Earl of Stair, a lady of uncommon abili- 
ties, possessed of all her faculties at ninety-nine, and universally 
esteemed. She died at Sorn castle in 1779. He served under 
Argyle at Sheriffmuir, was commissioner of the Assembly from 
1722 till 1731, and died in 1731. His only son, 

John, fourth Earl, represented the Peerage for forty-eight 
years. On the breaking out of the Rebellion in 1745, he raised a 
Highland regiment, and served as Adjutant- General under Sir John 
Cope. Tliere is a fine portrait of him in his Highland dress now 
in Loudoun Castle. He was made Governor of Virginia in 1756; 
Commander-in-Chief in America in the same year; was second 
in command under Lord Tyrconnel, who commanded the troops 
sent to Portugal in 1762; and died in Loudoun in 1782. Dying 
unmarried, his title devolved upon James Mure- Campbell, his 
cousin, and only son of Sir James Campbell of Lawers. Sir 
James Campbell was the third son of James, second Earl of Lou- 
doun, who died in 1786, and was killed at Fontenoy, at the head 
of his regiment, the Scots Greys. His son, James Mure Camp- 
bell, was Major- General in 1781. He married Miss M'Leod of 
Raasay, and died in 1786. He left an only daughter, the late 
Marchioness Dowager of Hastings and Countess of Loudoun,. 
Flora Mure-Campbell, who was born in Edinburgh, September 
2, 1780, married the late Marquis of Hastings, then Earl of Moira, 
12th July 1804, and died at Kelburne House, Ayrshire, July J, 
1840. She had six children, four of whom survived her. She 
was succeeded by her eldest son, the present Marquis of Hastings, 
who was born in 1808, married 1831 the Baroness Grey de Ruthyn, 
the only child of the twentieth baron of the family. They have 
one son and three daughters.

Eminent Persons connected toith the Parish.— Franck Marquis 
of Hastings was born in Ireland 7th December 1754. He was 
educated principally in England, and attended Harrow and Ox- 
ford. He entered the army in 1773, and travelled on the con- 
tinent until he went to America with his regiment in 1775. He 
was then a Lieutenant in the 5th Regiment, grenadier battalion. 
During the six years of war which he spent in that country, he was 
present at twenty-one engagements, besides many skirmishes. 
At Bunker's Hill, seven only of his company escaped unhurt. It 
was in allusion to his conduct upon this occasion that General 
Burgoyne in his official dispatch said, " Lord Rawdon has this 
day stamped his fame for life." Returning from America in a 
packet ship, he was captured by the Genereux French frigate, one 
of Count de Grass's squadron, and remained aboard the French 
fleet three months, when he was released. On his arrival in 
England, his services in America were appreciated by his coun- 
try ; be was created a peer of the realm, and made Aide-de-Camp 
to the King. Soon afterwards Mr Pitt put him in command of 
the army collected at Southampton, and intended to aid the Bour- 
bon cause in La Vendee. The destination, however, of this corps 
was changed, and he was sent with it to relieve, if possible, the 
army of the Duke of York, then in Holland, and so hemmed in 
and hotly pressed by the superior numbers of the enemy, as to be 
in imminent danger of being either taken prisoners of war or de- 
stroyed. This perilous and seemingly desperate enterprise, he 
conducted with consummate skill and bravery. By " one of the 
most extraordinary marches recorded in military history," he ef- 
fected, with 10,000 men, a junction with the allies, though two 
French armies were between them and Ostend, where he landed 
with his troops. It was upon this occasion he won from the Aus- 
trian Field Marshal, Clairfait, the high compliment, " Vous avez 
tente I'impossible et vous avez reussi." 

In 1803, Lord Rawdon, now Earl of Moira, to which title he 
succeeded on the death of his father in 1793, was appointed com- 
mander-in-chief of Scotland. In July 1804, he married Flora, 
Countess of Loudoun. The ceremony was performed in Lon- 
don by the Bishop of London Porteous, at the hou.se of Lady 
Perth. The Prince of Wales gave away the bride. 

He was made Master-General of the Ordnance in 1806, when he 
of course resigned the command in Scotland. He was also ap- 
pointed Constable of the tower of London, an honour which he

lie lield till his death. On the death of Mr Percival in 1812 
Lord Moira was commanded by the Prince Regent to form an ad- 
ministration, but his friends, Lords Grey and GrenviUe, insisting 
on their ministry having the appointment to all the offices in the 
royal household, a demand which Lord Moira deemed an infringe- 
ment of the rights of the sovereign, he resigned the responsibifity 
with which he had been entrusted. 

In 1813, he was made Governor- General and Commander-in- 
Chief of India, where he displayed in both capacities the full ex- 
tent of his wonderful powers. It would be going beyond the nar- 
row limits necessarily assigned to a sketch like the present to at- 
tempt anything more than a slight allusion to this period in his 
history, so full of great and important events. He found India in 
circumstances the most critical, and left it in circumstances the 
most prosperous. The kingdom of Nepaul, which he found in- 
solent and hostile to the British, and dangerous from its position 
along an open and extensive frontier, he completely subdued, and 
rendered dependent upon the British power for its existence as a 
separate kingdom. By a series of the mot beautifully planned 
and admirably executed military manoeuvres, along an extensive 
line of operations, he utterly destroyed the Pindarries, so long the 
scourge and terror of India, whose predatory excursions, with their 
hordes of cavalry sweeping over the peninsula, might be described 
in the language of the Prophet Joel, " A fire devoureth before 
them, and behind them a flame burneth — the land is as the Gar- 
den of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness, 
yea, and nothing shall escape them." He extinguished every hope 
so strongly entertained, in 1813, by the native powers, of their 
being able to expel the British from India; and, by moral, as well 
as by military tactics, he destroyed every germ of a powerful and 
extensively ramified confederacy to effect this long cherished pur- 
pose ; and yet, during the five years in which he was thus constant- 
ly occupied in accomplishing those vast and expensive designs, he 
filled the treasuries of the three Presidencies, which he found 
nearly emptied, and made returns to England five times greater in 
amount than the supplies which he received  While thus actively 
engaged in consolidating our Indian empire, he was not unmind- 
ful of its eternal interests, of that " Righteousness which exalts a 
nation." In peace and in war, no object was nearer his heart, or 
more constantly present to his thoughts, than the religious improve- 
ment of the people under his care ; and in all his efforts — and 



LOUDOUN, 



843 



they were many — to advance their souls' welfare, he was cordially, 
ably, and indefatigably seconded by Lady Hastings. 

The principal features of his administration are thus summed 
up by one who was well able both to appreciate and to delineate 
them: " The intuitive rapidity with which he seized the true his- 
tory of the country ; the comprehensive system in which, from the 
first, he proposed to embrace the relations of the Peninsula; the mas- 
terly military skill with which he circumscribed and crushed within 
his grasp the fugitive force with which he had to contend, while he 
dissipated all' the combinations by which it was supported ; his 
complete assertion of the British supremacy without the violation 
of public faith ; and the great progress which he made towards ma- 
turing all the reciprocal interests and obligations of the different 
states into consistency, must place his government among the 
most splendid and useful administrations by which the affairs of 
India have ever been directed." 

Lord Moira was created Marquis of Hastings, Earl of Rawdon, 
and Viscount Loudoun in 1816, and twice received the thanks of 
both Houses of Parliament for his achievements in India. He 
returned to England in 1823; and in 1824 was appointed Gover- 
nor of Malta. In recording this fact, and remembering at the 
same time all Lord Hastings had done for his country, and what 
he deserved from its hands, we cannot but say with the poet,. 
" How seldom doth a good man get what he merits — how seldom 
doth he merit what he gets." But though Malta was compara- 
tively a narrow and limited sphere for the exercise of such com- 
manding talents and enlarged views as were possessed by Lord 
Hastings, yet he directed to his new government all the ener- 
gies of his character ; for a great and good man, as he was, 
is like the sun of Heaven, which fructifies and gladdens a seclud- 
ed valley with the same genial beams with which it shines upon a 
world. The Maltese still cherish his memory, and remember his 
government with gratitude. He removed from Malta to Naples 
for change of air, and died on board the Revenge, in the Bay of 
Baia, November 28, 1826. At his own request his remains were 
conveyed back to Malta; and they now repose in the bastion of 
St John, at Valetta. 

We have thus glanced at the public events in the life of one of

lineate its many rare excellencies. No man was ever more enthusi- 
astically beloved by his immediate friends than Lord Hastings was. 
He possessed a warmth and generosity of heart, a force of sympa- 
thy, a playful cheerfulness, combined with a singularly refined and 
dignified manner, which charmed and captivated all with whom he 
came in contact. It has been said of him as of another great man, 
that his ample fortune absolutely sunk under the benevolence of 
his nature. " He died in perfect resignation to the Divine will, 
in charity with all mankind, in those sentiments of elevated piety 
which had been habitual to his life.'" 

71ie Lady Flora Elizabeth Hastings was born in Edinburgh upon 
the 11th of February 1806, while her father, then Lord Moira, 
was Commander-in-Chief in Scotland. There are few events in 
her early history which are interesting to any beyond her more 
immediate friends. She went to India in 1813 with her parents, 
when Lord Moira was appointed to the government of that coun- 
try, — returned to England in 1816, where she was educated and 
resided during her parents' absence, — and accompanied them to 
Malta in 1824, where she remained until her father's death. She 
visited Scotland and lived at different times there, in England, and 
abroad, from 1823 till 1834, when she was appointed one of the 
Ladies of the Bed-chamber to H. R. H. the Duchess of Kent, with 
.whom she remained the faithful and deeply-attached friend and 
servant, until the period of her death in 1839. The circumstan- 
ces attending that death are yet fresh in the nation's memory, and 
therefore need not be recited here. The sympathy of the whole 
nation in her sufferings and her wrongs was deeply felt and loudly 
expressed. She died at Buckingham Palace upon the 5th of July 
1839. From her beautiful Christian conduct during her severe 
trials, it may, with strict propriety, be said of her, that her " bonds 
in Christ were manifest in the palace as well as in all other places." 
Her body was conveyed to Loudoun at her own request, and was 
buried in the family crypt at Loudoun kirk. It was followed 
to the grave by her aged mother, sisters, and brother, and a few 
relations of the family. But many parishioners, sad and sorrow- 
ful, went to see her laid in the tomb, whose gentle and kind man- 
ners they had all experienced, and whose death they all sincerely 
mourned. Her venerable mother, loved and respected by all who 
had the privilege of knowing her, survived her daughter only six 
months. Her heart, too, was broken ; for no mother and daugh- 
ter could be more deeply attached to one another than they were. 



LOUDOUN.

Her daughter died with the words " my mother" on her lips, and 
the mother, in the feverish sleep which immediately preceded her 
death, often spoke of " her Flora." 

A year after her death, a volume of Lady Flora's poems was 
published and edited by her talented and devoted sister, Lady 
Sophia. It will be an enduring monument not only of the exten- 
sive acquirements, refined taste, and lofty poetic genius of its au- 
thor, but also of the desire, on her part and on that of her family, 
to do good to Loudoun, as the proceeds of the volume, in further- 
ance of a wish she had once expressed, were to be devoted to some 
object of usefulness in the parish. All who peruse these poems 
will agree in the opinion expressed of them by an able reviewer, 
that " Such a deep love for the beautiful, the exalted, and the holy, 
reigns throughout them all, that it is impossible to repel the con- 
viction that her actions accorded with her words, and that her 
words save but utterance to the calm and sinless feelings of her 
heart." 

The chief Land-owners in the parish are the following, with 
their respective valuations in pounds Scots : 



The Marquis of Hastings, . . L.4265 

Thomas Brown, Esq. of Waterhaughs, . 250 

James Alston, Esq. . • • 239 

Hugh Morton, Esq. Greenbank, . 113 

Messrs Smith, Parkhovise, • - 102 

Messrs Leiper, •. • • 140 

John Anderson, Esq. Ladytown, . 69 

John Wood, Esq. Passford, . . 49 

William Cameron, Esq. Loudounhill, . 35 

John Wardrop, Esq. Burnbank, . 82 

Thomas Morton, Esq. Skelly hill, . 25 



Besides the above, there are about 100 small proprietors, whose 
separate valuations vary from 10s. Scots to L.15 Scots. 

Parochial Registers.— There are two parish registers. 1. Mar- 
riages. The earliest date of this register is 3d December 1673, 
and it has been kept regularly since November 1759. 2. Bap- 
tisms. Earliest date 16th October 1763; kept regularly since 
November 1759. Few Dissenters register their children in this 
register. 

Map of the Parish. — The parish was surveyed by Robert Aitken, 
Beith, in 1 829, and an excellent lithograph map from this survey 
was published the same year by Ballantyne in Edinburgh. 

Antiquities. — Since the last Statistical Account was written, 
few antiquities have been discovered worth noticing. In Loudoun 
Park, some years ago, five stone coffins were found beneath a large 
cairn of stones. They contained what appeared to be the dust of 



846 AYRSHIRE. 

the bodies which they once inclosed, and a few cuttinfr instrn 
ments made of stone.. Whether this tumuhis was the monument 
of those « who fought in battles long ago," or is to be classed un- 
der the comprehensive and inexhaustible head of " Druidical re- 
mains," it is not easy to determine. 

Three vessels of Roman bronze were dug out of the moss in 
the farm of Braidlee, a few years ago. These vessels were a 
large and smaller pot, and a kettle, or rather jug, supported by 
three legs. The two latter vessels were found inside of the large 
pot, and are now m the possession of Mr Brown of Waterhaughs. 
They were very probably a cooking apparatus used by the Ro- 
man soldiery. From the remains of large oak trees which are 
occasionally found imbedded in moss in the upper district of the 
parish, in which these Roman antiquities were discovered, it is 
likely that it was at one time an extensive forest. 

Modern Buildings.— The only building in the parish of any note 
is Loudoun Castle, the imposing and magnificent mansion of the 
Loudoun family. One of the square towers, with its battlement of 
unknown antiquity, was destroyed when the castle was besieged by 
General Monk. Another tower, larger and higher, was built 
about the fifteenth century, and is still entire. A large addition was 
built to the castle by the Chancellor Loudoun ; but the greater and 
most stately part of the building was completed in 1 81L The li • 
brary contains upwards of 11,000 volumes. The old castle of 
Loudoun was destroyed by fire about 350 years ago.f 

• It was defended on this occasion by Lady Loudoun, who capitulated on honour- 
able terms. 

f The current tradition regarding the burning of the old castle, ascribes that 
event to the clan Kennedy at the period above-mentioned, and the remains of an 
old tower at Achruglen, on the Galston side of the valley, is still pointed out as 
having been their residence, The following fragment of a ballad, known among the 
peasantry from time immemorial, would assign a different author and later date to 
this foray. The same ballad, however, with the alteration of a few names, entitled 
Adam of Gordon, recording the burning of Towie Castle, in the north of Scot- 
land, in 1571, was published about a century ago by Lord Hailes in Glasgow, has 
since appeared in Percy's Reliques, in Chambers and in Pinkerton's Collections of 
Scottish Ballads. In a note to the ballad in Percy, it is said that the wandering 
minstrels changed the names in their songs, to suit them as far as possible to similar 
events in the histories of the different fainilies which they visited.

It fell about the Martinmas time, 
When the wind blew snell and cauld, 
That Adam o'Gordon said to his men, 
Where will we get a hold.

The first agricultural improver in the district was John, Earl of 
Loudoun. He built a bridge across the Irvine, made roads through 
the parish ; the one made from his own house to Newmilns was

the first constructed by statute-labour in the county. He plied 
vigorously the work of enclosing and planting. 

A great many improvements have taken place in the Loudoun 
estate within the last few years. Many farm-houses, of the most 
approved description, have been built, which add to the beauty of 
the landscape, as well as to the comfort of the tenants. Many 
roads have also been made. A large tile-work has been in ope- 
ration for the last six years, solely for the benefit of the tenants on 
the estate, who pay a small per centage for the tiles. This year 
upwards of a million tiles have been manufactured, which will drain 
250 acres. Another tile-work has this year been erected on a 
part of the estate, near the village of Darvel. It is let on a 
lordship, and is intended to supply tiles for public sale. 

Plantations. — The plantations around Loudoun Castle contain 
some fine trees. Lord John, mentioned above, planted, about 100 
years ago, upwards of a million of trees, chiefly elm, ash, and oak. 
Manyof the elms and oaks, and these too not the largest, which 
were lately cut down, contained upwards of 150 square feet of 
timber. The soil seems admirably adapted for forest trees. Many 
of the various kinds of trees and shrubs, such as yew, holly, Por- 
tugal laurel, cedars, and arbor vitae, American oaks, hickories, 
walnuts, &amp;c. have grown to a remarkable size. Many of these 
shrubs were brought from America by Lord John himself, who 
was Governor of Virginia in 1756. " He also formed," it is ob- 
served by Dr Walker, " one of the most extensive collections of 
willows ever made in this country. Wherever he went, during 
his long military services, he sent home every sort of valuable tree 
he could meet with. All the willows he found cultivated in Eng- 
land, Ireland, Holland, Flanders, and Germany, as also in Ame- 
rica and Portugal, where he commanded, were procured and sent 
to Loudoun." One Portugal laurel, now in the old garden, sweeps 
with its branches a circumference of 140 feet. The " old yew 
tree of Loudoun," which grows close to the castle wall, is of un- 
known antiquity. It is said that one of the family charters was 
signed under it in the time of William the Lion. One of the ar- 
ticles of union, it is also said, was subscribed by Lord Hugh, under 
its deep shade. When Lord James went into voluntary banishment 
to Holland, he addressed his letters, being afraid of detection 
for his lady " to the gudewife at the Auldton, at the old yew tree of 

 The first " Ayrshire rose" was brought into this country by Lord John from 
America. The original plant is yet growing fresli and vigorous at Loudoun Castlf.

tination in safety. The old yew tree is still growing fresh and 
strong in the full enjoyment of a green and healthy old age. 

Manufactures. — Almost the whole population residing in Dar- 
vel and Newmilns, amounting to upwards of 8000, depend, direct- 
ly or indirectly, for their subsistence upon hand-loom weaving. 
With the exception of a small wool-mill, this is the only branch 
of manufacture carried on in the parish. The following table will 
show the number of weavers and of those immediately connected 
with weaving in these villages, and also the average amount of the 
wages of each class : 

Newmilns. Darvel. Total. Weekly wages. 

Average. 

Male weavers, - 460 267 727 From 3s. to 8s. 

Female weavers, . 90 61 151 3s. to Gs.

years upwards, - 230 189 419 2s. to 3s. 6d.

Weaver's wrights, 
Warpers, warp-winders, and

Agents and maimfacturcrs, 

Within the last two or three years, since the jacquard machine 
has been brought into almost universal use' in harness weaving, 
upwards of L.1300 have been expended in Newmilns alone upon 
machines. The introduction of this machine has been of great 
advantage, not only to the weaver but to his children, who former- 
ly were employed as early as the age of eight to perform for the 
weaver the mechanical labour now more efficiently accomplished 
bv the machine. 

The only other branch of manufacture carried on in this parish, 
besides weaving, is wool-spinning. The wool-mill was established 
in 1804. It belongs to a company of carpet manufacturers in Kil- 
marnock ; employs 25 hands ; and manufactures about 8000 yards 
of woollen yarn per annum. 

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Villages. — The two villages or towns in the parish are Newmilns 

and Darvel. 

1. Newmilns contains a population of 1988. It is situated upon 
the river Irvine, and about the centre of the parish. It contains 
the parish church and school, and post-office. It was made a 
burgh of barony by James IV. The ancient burgh is governed 
by two bailies, a chancellor, a treasurer, and fiscal, and thirteen 
councillors ; and, it is to be presumed, that, in such a multitude of . 
councillors, there is wisdom. In Newmilns, there are publicans,

14 ; tailors, 6 ; butchers, 2 ; bakers, 2; shoemakers, 3; hcensed 
grocers, 15 ; carters and coal -drivers, 7 ; wrights, 5 ; smiths, 2 ; 
milliners, 2 ; carriers to Glasgow and Kilmarnock, 2 ; surgeons, 
2 ; writers, 1 ; teachers of schools, 4. 

2. Darvel, population, 1360. It is situated a mile east from 
Newmilns. About ninety years ago, it contained but four houses. 
There are in it shoemakers, 19; sewers, 17; masons, 8; publi- 
cans, 10; tailors, 8; bakers, 4; carters, 7; carriers, 4; sawers, 
4 ; wrights, 12 ; butchers, 4 ; coopers, 1 ; flax-dressers, 1 ; dyer, 1 ; 
grocers, 18; smiths, 4; surgeons, 3; teacher, 1; &amp;c. 

Besides the above, there is the small village of Auldton or Al- 
ton, in the north-west part of the parish, containing about 24 fa- 
milies. In this village there are, 1 smith, 1 wright, 1 shoemaker, 
1 grocer, 1 publican, and 1 teacher. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is most conveniently 
situated for the parish. It was built in 1738. It is seated for 
800 only ; though the present number of communicants regularly 
partaking of the Lord's Supper in it is upwards of 900  It is 
much out of repair. Every hope is entertained that a new one 
will soon be built. The manse was built in 1768, and additions 
were made to it at a subsequent period. It was repaired four 
years ago. 

The glebe contains eight acres arable land, and eight acres of 
pasture. It is worth about L.50 per annum. The stipend con- 
sists of 165 bolls of meal, 14 bolls of barley, and L.43 in money. 

Religious Denominations. — About 620 families profess to be- 
long to the Established Church, of whom 315 are in Newmilns, 
167 in Darvel, and 138 in the country. Of these, there are fa- 
milies or rather individuals who are not in communion with any 
church, but who have been baptized in the Establishment. 

There are two Dissenting congregations in the parish, one con- 
nected with the United Associate Synod, the other with the Re- 
formed Presbyterian or Cameronians. The United Secession 
congregation was formed in Newmilns in 1772. Their first place 
of worship was built in 1773, and contained 400 sittings. Their 
present church was built in 1833, and contains 780 sittings. The 
congregation consists of persons from different parishes ; but 
chiefly from Loudoun and Galston. The number of communi- 
cants in 1841 was 470. 

The Reformed Presbyterian old place of worship was built in 
Darvel in 1785, and the present one in 1835. There are at present 



852 



AYRSHIRE. 



89 families and 165 members in Darvel and its neighbourhood 
professing to adhere to this body. Besides the above there are 3 
Roman Catholic, 2 Episcopalian, and 10 or 12 Baptist families in 
the parish. 

Education. — The total number of schools in the parish is six ; 
of these, one is the parochial school, situated in Newmilns. 
Darvel and Alton have school-rooms and dwellinor-houses for the 
teacher, provided for them by the Loudoun family ; one in New- 
milns is a female school, which is partly supported by subscriptions. 
The other two, Harkowsike and Newmihis, are wholly unendowed. 
The amount of fees paid to the parochial schoolmaster is L.40 
per annum. The salary is the maximum, with house and garden. 
He receives L»14 per annum, as clerk to the session and heritors, 
and L. 10 per annum, as factor on a mortification for the benefit 
of the poor, left by a Mrs Crawfurd. 

There are about 450 children attending at present all the schools 
in the parish. The children from the landward districts enter 
school when about five years of age, and. remain about five years 
at school. In the villages, they are sent between the years of 
five and seven, and remain from eighteen months to three years. 
The education in the manufacturing villages is sadly defective. 
This arises solely from want, not of the will, but of the means on 
the part of the parents to educate their children. Nothing can ex- 
ceed the anxiety of the parents in this respect, but they can neither 
spare their children's work nor their wages. The female school 
has been of much service in teaching useful bi-anches of knowledge, 
industry, and habits of neatness in the children. The wages are 
4s. a-quarter, including books, &amp;c. It is attended by about 60 
scholars; and, though only begun five years ago, has succeeded 
admirably. The parish school is most efficiently taught. 

Literature. — There are three libraries in the parish; one is 
congregational as to superintendence, but every individual in the 
parish may read from it at Is. a-year. It was established two 
years ago, and contains nearly 300 volumes. The other two, one 
in Darvel, and one in Newmilns, are subscription libraries, and 
have been established for many years. They contain together 
about 1000 volumes. These libraries have been of incalculable 
benefit in instructing and interesting the working classes. 

Friendly Societies—hevQ are in the parish one Masonic, to 
relieve the sick and infirm brethren connected with the lodge; 
two Co-operative, to obtain groceries, meal, cheese, &amp;c. at 



LOUDOUN. 



prime cost ; the members paying shop rent, salesman, &amp;c. ; one 
Economical, to join a small part of their weekly gains, and to lodge 
these in bank when they amount to L.4, the principle being nearly 
that of the savings' bank ; two Funeral, to pay for the mortcloth 
and the expenses of the funeral of the members, their parents, 
and children ; one Farmers', for mutual relief in case of fire, on 
the principle of fire insurance. 

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The number of persons at present 
upon the poor's roll of the parish is 70. Those paupers may 
be divided into the following classes, with the weekly aliment re- 
ceived by each. Aged and infirm, 46, three of whom receive 
weekly 2s. 6d. ; five, 2s.; five, Is. 6d.; thirteen, Is.; twelve, 9d»; 
eight, 6d. Widows with families, 9,— one, 2s. 6d ; three, 2s. ; 
three, Is. 6d. ; two, 6d. Orphans, 9, — four receive 2s. ; three, 
Is 6d. ; two. Is. Fatuous, 7, — one, 7s.; one, 3s.: one, 4s. 3d. ; 
one. Is. ; one, 9d. ; one, 6d. Total, 70 : per week, L.4, 10s. 
In addition to the above weekly allowance, L.24, 12s. 6d. is paid 
by the heritors for house-rent to the paupers, while upwards of 
L.30 is expended on incidental poor, whose names are not on the 
roll ; and also in occasionally giving additional aid to the regular 
pauper. The above sum is raised by voluntary assessment, except 
what is collected at the church door, which in the year amounts 
to about L.34. The assessment is laid upon the valued rent, the 
heritors charging the tenants with one-half. 

Charitable Bequests.— Theve are three charities in the parish : 
1. Smith's Bequest, left by a Mr John Smith, who was born in 
Newmilns, and died a merchant in Glasgow. It is for decayed bur- 
gesses in Newmilns, their widows, and children. The managers 
are, the two magistrates, and two councillors named by them ; 
the minister, and two elders named by him. The income at their 
disposal is L.60 per annum, which is all expended in Newmilns, and 
is confined to those who receive no parochial aid. 2. Mrs Crawfurd 
of Bolquairn's mortification, of L.16 per annum, in favour of four old 
people, L.4 to each ; the session are the managers. 3. Mr Brown 
of Waterhaugh's Charitable Foundation educates twelve children, 
six in Galston, and six in Loudoun. The parents of the children 
receive L.2, 3s. 6d. to clothe their children ; the school fees being 
paid to the master besides. 

Pauperism is either steadily upon the increase, or the poor are 
getting more into the habit of seeking relief from the parochial 
fund. The causes of our pauperism are of course various, such as 



'854

bad habits, bad health, and bad trade. As pauperism is a disease 
inherent in the body politic, it never can be altogether cured 
It has baffled human skill since the Fall, and will do so till the' 
end of the world. As Sir Thomas Brown says, « Statists that la- 
bour to contrive a commonwealth without oifr poverty, take away 
the object of charity, and forget the prophecy of Christ." But as 
far as poverty can be cured in our country parishes by human 
means, the best means for Scotland, we humbly conceive to be, a 
more extended and well-worked Scotch poor law, and a more 
extended and well-worked Scotch church. 

The poor in the villages are very kind to each other. As far 
as they can assist, they do so. But in most of our weaving'villages, 
each man has his hands full at home. Besides, poverty while it 
increases the demand for charity, « brings on a sore and petted 
mood," and creates a selfish spirit which shuts the hand that, in 
better times, would be liberal. We have not found the poor 
greedy. They are much more grateful for small favours than 
greedy for great ones. They often suffer fearfully before they 
complain. Families will live for days, and even weeks, on a few 
potatoes and salt, and pawn their clothes before they seek public 
aid, though they know, that, whenever there is a case of desti- 
tution, relief will be granted. Necessity often teaches them 
a secret which it would be better they had never discovered, 
viz. upon how little food life may be supported. This secret has 
led many, steeped in poverty, to the whisky-shop. Hundreds 
of gallons of whisky are drunk by men who are starving. Drunk- 
enness is undoubtedly, in many cases, the effect as much as the 
cause of poverty. The weaver, after sitting sixteen hours a- 
day in a damp loom-shop, without healthy bodily exercise, his 
nerves unstrung, his digestive organs deranged, will often rob him- 
self of his food and raiment to banish, by intoxication, that bodily 
wretchedness and mental irritability which he knows, from sad ex- 
perience, will soon return with increased misery. The habit of 
drinking is thus often formed, and, when once formed, never almost 
is it banished. Much whisky is consumed in our villages by a class 
of weavers termed trampers, generally young men, who, wearied 
of the restrictions of home, wander from village to village, working 
for such as keep looms on purpose to supply those wandering me- 
chanics. They live miserably, spending the greater portion of 
their wages in whisky, which they consume, not only in public and 
private houses, but also in the fields. After thus " wasting their 



LOUDOUN.

substance in riotous living," they frequently decamp upon a sudden, 
leaving behind them debt and a bad example, neither of which 
they ever intend to cancel, and taking with them, in exchange for 
what they leave, many of the young meq of the place where they 
have for a time been located, who are, in some distant village, ini- 
tiated into all the loose ongoings of the tramper's life. 

Inns, Alehouses, t.— There are 26 public-houses in the parish, 
15 in Newmilns, 9 in Darvel, and 2 in the country. The average 
quantity of whisky consumed in the year in the parish is about 
4500 gallons. This quantity, when mixed for retail sale, and when 
sold at retail prices, will bring nearly L.4000.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS 

ON THE COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q793283">AYR</name>.</head> 
<p>
This important county is bounded on the south, by that of Wig 
ton and the stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; on the east, by the coun- 
ties of Lanark and Dumfries ; on the north, by that of Renfrew ; 
and on the west, by the Irish Channel and the Frith of Clyde. 
It is computed to contain about 1600 square miles. Formerly, 
it was divided into the three districts of Carrick, Kyle, and 
Cunninghame, — the first lying on the south side of the river 
Doon ; the second between that river and the Irvine ; and 
the third comprehending the whole of the county north of the Ir- 
vine. 

The rivers are those of Ayr, Sdnchar, Girvan, Doon, Irvine, 
and Garnock. 

This county possesses great advantages in its maritime situa- 
tion, and several excellent harbours, as well as in the great abun- 
dance of coal and limestone, over its whole extent. 

The valued rent of the county is L. 191,605, Os. 7d. Annual 
value of real property as assessed in 1815, L. 409,983. Population 
in 1841, 164,522. Number of inhabited houses in 1841, 30,240, 
The Parliamentary constituency in 1841, 4141.

PRESBYTERY OF KINTYRE, SYNOD OF ARGYLE. 

THE REV. ALLAN M'NAUGHTON, D.D. MINISTER. 



L — Topography and Natural History. 

This parish is situated in the mouth of the Clyde, and forms 
the smaller of two very extensive parishes, which divide between 
them the magnificent and strikingly picturesque Island of Arran. 
The small Island of Lamlash, or the Holy Isle, as it is sometimes 
called, also belongs to it. 

Name. — The name of the parish requires little explanation, be- 
ing obviously a compound formed by Kill, the well known Gaelic 
name for a burying-place, and Bride or Bridget that once po- 
pular female saint, whose name still lives in the names of so 
many parishes and other places, both in Scotland and other 
kingdoms. The etymology of the name of the island itself is dis- 
puted. Some derive it from the two Gaelic words Arr and //m, 
the High Island ; and others from Arr Fhinn, the slaughter or 
field of Fingal, conceiving it to have received its name from a 
battle said to have been fought at the north end of the island by 
Fingal against a son of the King of Norway, whose forces he to- 
tally exterminated. The field in which the battle was fought, is 
still called Arrin by the natives. Dr MacCulloch smiles at this 
etymology ; and having made the notable discovery, that " Fin- 
gal was never heard of in Arran till lately," insists that Ar- 
ran is simply ancient British, signifying a land of mountains. His 
,etymology is most probably correct ; and if we consider ancient 
British and Gaelic as kindred branches of the Celtic, it is sub- 
stantially the same as the first mentioned above. But his state- 
ment in connection with it is a bold one even for Dr MacCulloch ; 

' An interesting and amusing outline of the history of St Bridget, or Brigid occurs 
in the first volume of Moore's History of Ireland in the Cabniet Cyclopedia. It dif 
fers in some particulars from that given by Scotch antiquarians.— Vide 1 cnnant s 
Tour, under the head of" Abernethy," with the authorities there referred to.

and if made in the presence of any Highlander in Arran, his sur- 
prise would not be less than that of any Lowland Scot, whom he 
might try to convince that « Bruce and Wallace were never heard 
of in Scotland till lately." 

Boimdaries.— The ecclesiastical division of Arran has been 
made longitudinally. Kilbride occupies the whole of its east side, 
except a couple of miles at its south end ; and is spread over a 
surface .of country from 20 to 22 miles in length from the Cock of 
Arran, a noted sea-mark at its northern extremity, to Dippin, a 
farm in the south. It varies in breadth from 2 to 4 miles, or 
41 miles from the shore to the top of a continuous range of 
mountains, which separates it from the parish of Kilmorie. It 
contains about 42,000 imperial acres. 

Topographical Appearances.— The most prominent feature in 
the general aspect of the parish is its alpine character. The 
greater proportion of it consists of mountains and high hills, which 
present considerable variety of outline and appearance. From the 
southern point of the parish to Brodick, their height is but mode- 
rate, averaging not more than 800 feet above the level of the sea. 
They rise for the most part in gentle acclivity from the cultivated 
grounds near the shore ; present few bold precipices or rugged 
outlines, and are clothed with. a mixture of green grass and brown 
heather to their tops; but from Brodick to Lochranza their 
character entirely changes. A considerable way up, a few of them 
have the usual mountain covering ; but many are bare precipices 
from their very foundations ; and the greater number raise their 
naked tops to the sky in stupendous pyramids and spires of rough 
granite. As seen from certain portions, they appear to the behold- 
er as if they had but yesterday been upheaved from their primitive 
beds, below the bottom of the ocean. The absolute height of 
these mountains is not very great, the elevation of Goatfell in 
Gaelic Gaoth Cheinn, the mountain of winds, falling somewhat 
short of 3000 feet. But presenting as they do, at a glance, their 
full dimensions from the shore to their tops, and being congre- 
gated together in one stupendous group, Goatfell, towering above 
the rest, like a proud Highland chief surrounded by the cadets of 
his clan, few scenes can in their general effect be more impressive- 
ly grand and magnificent. In Scotland there is no alpine scenery 
that can in all respects match them, except, perhaps, that of the 
CuchuUin hills in Skye. These mountains are intersected by deep 
cories and narrow glens, whose dark and sombre abysses produce

an effect upon the mind as overwhelming as the majestic moun- 
tains among which they repose. This is especially the case with 
Glenrosa, after proceeding a short way beyond its mouth ; 
and with Glen Sannox, " the sublime in magnitude, and sim- 
plicity, and obscurity, and silence." Some miles north from 
Glen Sannox, another scene presents itself, quite different in cha- 
racter from these, but scarcely less imposing to the view. A large 
mass of the mountain which crowns that part of the island having 
given way, and broken into numberless detached fragments, these 
are seen for more than a mile of rapid declivity, in promiscuous 
disorder, piled upon each other : presenting the appearance of an 
army flying before a superior force, one fugitive with his enormous 
bulk pressing down another, and both threatened with being over- 
whelmed by a still more gigantic form behind. This rocky stream 
continues its flow till it reaches the ocean. 

The parish, both to the north and south, presents many other 
scenes of wild and savage magnificence. Those of soft and roman- 
tic beauty are not less numerous. Round almost the whole of the 
sea coast, except where the landscape is indented by the valleys and 
bays, there is a narrow and level border of land, walled up on the 
landward side by a high ridge of rocks, which the sea appears to 
have washed when its level was higher than at present. In some 
places this ridge is a series of rude cliffs and naked precipices ; 
but in general, and more especially from Sannox to Brodick, it is ex- 
ceedingly beautiful and picturesque ; its rugged features disappear- 
ing amid the luxuriant ivy which clings to its face, and the rich 
clothing of natural birch, ash, oak, and thick brushwood which 
springs up among its numerous clefts, and crowns its top, covering, 
without concealing it. Here a cave scooped out by the sea, there 
a romantic amphitheatre formed by one of its numerous bends ; 
and next a white cascade tumbling over the precipices,— give a va- 
riety to its successive aspects, which is ever and anon tempting the 
traveller to stop and admire. 

For scenery, combining in a high degree both the beautiful and 
the sublime, the grounds about Sannox and the two bays of Brod- 
ick and Lamlash, wiil always attract attention. Mid- Sannox is 
formed by nature for being the site of a baronial residence. With 
its deep dark glen retiring behind, Cir mor, and Ceum na callich f 
towering majestically above it, its extensive grounds clothed in 
beautiful copsewood, and spreading out in gentle and varied undu-

lations on every side, and its romantic river now buried amid deep 
ravines, and now seen threading its way in meandering curves to 
the sea, it is the very spot which an architect of taste would choose 
for giving a local habitation to his pencil's ablest design. Nature 
and art have both contributed largely to the rare combination of 
beauty and grandeur, which distinguishes the scenery round Bro- 
dick Bay. The bay itself is a deep regular curve of about two 
miles in length, belted the greater part of its compass with a beach 
of fine sand ; whence an extensive and level plain, ornamented with 
cottages, villas, cultivated fields, and flourishing plantations, retires 
inwards, till it meets the beautiful and romantic valleys of Glen- 
rosa, Glensheraig, and Glencloy. On its north side, Arran 
Castle, the insular residence of the Duke of Hamilton, shows a 
glimpse of its roof and battlements, among the trees of the richly 
wooded elevation on which it stands, pleasure grounds and exten- 
sive plantations surrounding it; Goatfell rising in the rear, and 
the whole line of the opposite frith, with the distant hills on the 
mainland in the foreground. Lamlash is very little indebted to 
art, but its capabilities are very great ; and, with the addition of a 
few plantations on ground which is at present yielding nothing, 
and the cultivation of some waste land, well adapted for the ope- 
rations of the plough, it could be made a place of very great beauty. 
Even in its present state, no lover of nature can behold its striking 
scenery without admiring it. The noble bay which forms its most 
prominent feature is a semicircle, from its northern to its south- 
ern extremity, fully three miles in length. In the mouth of it 
stands the Holy Isle ; so picturesque by the beauty of its shape, 
which is an irregular cone, nearly 900 feet high ; and its variegat- 
ed surface, where heath-clad hills and grassy ridges are seen in- 
termingled with naked red sandstone, surmounted by rude basaltic 
columns piled tier above tier upon each other. On each side of the 
island, there is a convenient entrance into the bay, which it both 
adorns and protects ; and within, a harbour, with excellent hold- 
ing ground, of sufficient depth of water for vessels of all sizes, 
and room enough for accommodating the largest fleet. Oppo- 
site to the island, and about the centre of the bay, stands the neat 
village of Lamlash, spread in a beautiful curve along the beach, 
with a sloping bank, crowned with thriving wood behind it. The 
rest of the scenery round the bay possesses much of that variety 
which the lovers of the picturesque delight to behold. On the 
west side lies the vale of Lamlash, a beautiful tract of well-culti- 
vated and well-watered alluvial soil, reposing among hills of beau-

tifully varied outline ; on the north and east, the grounds about 
the manse, rising in gentle slopes and undulations towards the 
hills, intersected by numerous streams and rivulets ; on both sides 
of the bay, in approaching its two extremities, a line of thick copse- 
wood, clothing and sometimes hiding the barrier of precipitous 
rocks and cliffs which separate the level ground along the shore, 
from the cultivated land above ; and everywhere streams with 
wood-covered banks,' which, along with the plantations on the hill 
behind the village, in the romantic glen of Altachorvie, and other 
places, gives the bay upon the whole a warm and clothed ap- 
pearance. Whitingbay, to the south of Lamlash, is here entitled 
also to its own share of notice. It wants the bold features of the 
scenery farther north ; but it presents many spots of soft and ro- 
mantic beauty, more especially about the glen of Ashdale. Here, 
as well as elsewhere along the coast, most eligible spots for neat 
and elegant villas are continually meeting the eye ; and if it suit- 
ed the views of the proprietor to grant building-leases, all these 
would soon be occupied. Opulent individuals from Glasgow and 
Ayrshire would in a few years ornament the whole line of coast 
from Sannox to Largiebeg, with a succession of neat summer ha- 
bitations for themselves and families, and make Arran the most 
attractive island in the West Highlands. 

Climate. — The climate of the parish is upon the whole mild and 
moderate. There is seldom any long continuance of intense heat 
in summer ; and as seldom of extreme cold and frost in winter. 
Goatfell and the neighbouring hills are in winter usually covered 
with a mantle of snow. But on the lower grounds in the valleys along 
the coast, in the heaviest storms, snow seldom lies more than a 
day ; and so rarely are there any severe visitations of frost and biting 
east winds, that at Arran Castle, and the Whitehouse, many of 
the plants of warmer regions stand the whole winter in the open 
air. Among these may be mentioned geraniums, myrtles, fuschias. 
Calceolaria rngosa, Passiflora ccerulea. Camellia, Hydrangea lior- 
tensis, and Magnolia grandiflora. It must be acknowledged, how- 
ever, that what the parish wants in snow and frost, is abundantly 
made up to it in rain ; of which few places even in the Hebrides re- 
ceive a more liberal share. The prevailing winds are the south and 
the west, which almost always bring copious showers along with 
them. And from the great bulk and height of the Arran moun- 
tains, which attract every cloud from the Atlantic as it passes, they 
often come charged with such overwhelming floods, that the nu- 
merous mountain torrents swell in an hour's time ; often overflow

their banks in approaching the lower grounds; and sometimes 
sweep before them the best built bridges in the parish. When 
these violent storms of wind and rain occur, as sometimes hap- 
pens, in summer or harvest, the crops of corn and potatoes suffer 
great injury. The prevalence of strong west winds in winter has, 
in the more exposed places, given all the trees an inclination east- 
ward, and thinned their branches and foliage on the exposed side. 
The amount of rain that falls during the year varies very consi- 
derably in different parts of the parish, the places shut in among 
the high mountains having of course the amplest share. At the 
Whitehouse, in the neighbourhood of Lamlash, the quantity that 
fell in 1833 was 66 inches, and 6-lOths; in 1834, 57.6; and in 
1835, 73.7. Notwithstanding this superabundance of moisture, 
the climate upon the whole is far from being unpleasant. Those 
dull hazes and fogs, which often linger for days and weeks over 
many other places in this country, are in a great measure unknown 
in the parish of Kilbride ; and days of constant rain do not often 
occur, mornings of drenching floods being not unfrequently suc- 
ceeded by bright and beautiful afternoons of clear and smiling sun- 
shine. Few places in Scotland are, it is believed, more favoura- 
ble to health. The diseases which most generally prevail are 
those arising from poor fare, and exposure to damp and wet wea- 
ther. None can be mentioned that is peculiar to the place. Tiie 
eight-day sickness, spoken of in the former Statistical Account, 
which a few generations ago was so fatal to infants and children, 
is now never heard of, having disappeared along with its cause, — 
unskilful treatment on the part of self-taught midwives. The epide- 
mics of large towns are occasionally imported by young men and 
women at service in the lo\y country. But they do not remain long, or 
spread to any extent. Instances of longevity are numerous. Of five 
members of the kirk-session of Kilbride who died within the last 
twelve years, one was ninety-two, three eighty-eight, and one 
seventy-nine years of age. The writer has in the course of the present 
week, April 1840, attended the funerals of two of his parish- 
ioners, one of whom a female who lived at Brodick reached the 
very advanced age of ninety-nine ; the other was entering upon his 
eighty-ninth year. There are at present living within a mile of 
Lamlash, and enjoying the unimpaired use of their mental facul- 
ties, three men, two of them several years above ninety, and the 
third, eighty-eight. Mr Paterson, in his " Account of the Island 
of Arran," in the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, mentions a si-

milar fact, of which the writer is cognizant, viz. that in the year 
1834, " in a population of less than 400 persons about the village 
of Lamlash, there were 16 individuals living, the average age of 
whom was 84i years, and not one of them was under 80." 

Hydrography.— parish is pre-eminently " a land of foun- 
tains and rivers of waters." Wells of the purest water, gushing 
out from the clefts of the rocks and the sides of the hills, are met 
with in every part of the parish. Some of those in the north are 
strongly impregnated with iron and other mineral substances. 
Every valley has its river, with a numerous host of tributary streams 
that pour into it from every side their liberal contributions. The 
rivers of North and South Sannox, of Glenrosa, Glencloy, and 
Ashdale, are the largest. The last of these, a short way up the 
glen, has two beautiful cascades, one above a hundred, the other 
about fifty feet high, which fall with picturesqe effect, through 
gorges of columnar basalt, over veins of the same substance on 
which the columns rest. When the river is swelled by rains from 
the hills, people can pass dry between the larger cascade and the 
rock over which it falls. The parish contains but one lake, insig- 
nificant in size, which is situated on the Ury Hill, south of Lam- 
lash. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The geological phenomena presented 
by the Island of Arran, and more especially the parish of Kilbride, 
are almost without a parallel in Scotland for interest and importance. 
They exhibit within a small compass a kind of epitome of the 
mineral structure of the globe ; shewing in regular progression, 
the successive formations, from the primitive unstratified granite, 
to the diluvial gravel and sand reposing in incipient strata on the 
latest formed rocks. They are, in fact, the speculations which 
the structure of Arran suggested to Hutton, and received so elo- 
quent an exposition in the " Illustrations" of his disciple, Professor 
Playfair, which first raised geology to the rank of a science in 
Great Britain. Accordingly, there is no part of Scotland, which 
geologists have more frequently visited, or described with more 
minute and laborious care. Professor Jameson, in his Minera- 
logy of Arran, gave the first detailed account of it. He has since 
been followed by Necker, Headrick, MacCulloch, Sedgwick, Mur- 
chison, and Messrs Oenhausen and Dechen, two scientific Ger- 
mans ; all of whom gave the results of their enquiries to the public. 
To gratify in some measure the curiosity of those who may not have 
seen the elaborate geological statistics of those who have published

on the subject, it may here le stated in the words of Professor Jame- 
son, that Arran and it may be added, the parish of Kilbride in parti- 
cular " affords highly instructive examples of Neptunian and Plu- 
tonian rocks of the primitive and transition classes, viz. clay-slate, 
mica slate, greyvk'acke, as Neptunian deposits ; and granite, as a 
Plutonian rock. The junctions of the granite, of which there are 
two formations, with each other, and with the Neptunian slates, 
are most instructive ; and annually attract to Arran, visitors from 
all parts of Britain, and even from distant continental countries. 
Reposing on these rocks is a deposit of the old red sandstone, 
on which rests the coal formation ; and a great conformable series 
of strata of red sandstone, by some geologists referred to the so- 
called new red sandstone. These Neptunian secondary rocks are 
traversed in all directions by Plutonian rocks of the porphyry and 
trap series, affording an admirable study to the geologist interested 
in the natural history of ignigenous formations."  

The two granite formations appear towering above the rest of 
the island, in Goatfell and the neighbouring high mountains. This 
group is invested all round by the slate mountains, which form a 
sort of elevated terrace projected from their sides ; and the strata 
of which rest upon the granite at various angles of inclination. 
The junction of the slate and granite is generally concealed by 
the soil, the grass and loose stones ; but it is distinctly seen on the 
north side of Tornidneoin, near Lochranza, and one or two other 
places. The slate is covered by the sandstone and other secon-  
dary strata, which at the north side of the island rest upon it at an 
angle sometimes approaching very close to the perpendicular, but 
towards the south subside into much lower elevations. Scridan 
forms a remarkable spot, as being a central point from which these 
strata dip towards opposite quarters, taking corresponding ranges 
south to Corrie, and north to the Cock. Of the veins of trap and 
porphyry which traverse the secondary strata, specimens may be 
seen along any part of the coast. Two of the most interesting ap- 
pear, one on the shore below Corrigills ; and the other on the 
eastern shore of Lamlash. At the former place are seen two 
veins, one of trap, the other of porphyry, or porphyritic claystone, 
ascendingthrough the sandstone, in some places in immediate contact 
with each other, and elsewhere with portions of the conglomerate of 
red sandstone interposed. In the sandstone, fragments of trap of the 
same character as the vein, are here and there imbedded ; while

phy.

the porphyry winds itself round the fragments which' obstruct its 
course. On the Lamlash shore, the sandstone strata are inter- 
sected by an obhque vein of trap ; and that again is traversed by 
another vertical vein, of which the exterior surface consists of 
pitch-stone. A vertical vein decomposing into spheroidal forms is 
alsoseen in this place, traversing the last mentioned veins, and the 
secondary strata also. Dr MacCuUoch, from whom this description 
of them is taken, has given neat and accurate diagrams of these 
two very interesting spots. In the various places where the trap 
veins appear, they sometimes cross each other, without mixing 
their substances. The veins themselves are not always uniform in 
their texture, parts containing nodules of a darker-coloured trap 
than the general body of the vein. There is often a mutual pe- 
netration of the trap and sandstone. 

XJneful Materials. — Coal is found a little south of the Cock. It 
is of the kind called blind or glance coal, and is considered of ex- 
cellent quality. About eighty years ago, an attempt was made to 
work it, but the undertaking, for some reason, was not prosecuted 
long. A slate quarry, in the same neighbourhood, was at one time 
wrought to a considerable extent; but its distance from the har- 
bour at Lochranza, and the direction of its strata, which is con- 
trary to the declivity of the mountain in which it is situated, caus- 
ed the work to be long ago discontinued. Among these strata, 
ironstone is abundant ; but no attempt has ever been made to turn it 
to account. The most valuable mineral among them is the lime- 
stone, which abounds in this parish, both to the north and south, 
and is not less excellent than abundant. There is a quarry of 
limestone at Corrie, which has been wrought for a great number of 
years, supplying the Island of Arran and many places in the main- 
land. The stone is of a blue or purple colour, and contains nu- 
merous shells, principally oysters and clams, which retain their na- 
tural shape. When analysed, it was found to contain in one place, 
98| parts of carbonate of lime to 1 of clay ; and in another place, 
97 of carbonate of lime to 3 of clay and iron. The Accraploch 
limestone, at the head of Benlester, near Lamlash, is not less va- 
luable. Its proportions are 96 carbonate of lime, 3 iron, and 1 
clay. The Arran freestone is of the best quality, and in great 
abundance. The only quarries of it which are regularly wrought 
are near Corrie, whence it is exported in considerable quantities 
to the Clyde, Ireland, and in other directions. The rock-crystals 
of Arran have long been celebrated. These are found in the gra- 
nite mountains, in veins in the granite, or in cavities of the granite

itself. Their general figure is regular six-sided prisms, acu- 
minated by six faces. Their colour varies, some being black, 
others brown, and a few a beautiful yellow. The yellow are the 
most valued, but the brown is the most abundant. The variety of 
emerald, named Beryl, occurs in regular six-sided prisms, asso- 
ciated with fine crystals of mica, felspar, and rock-crystal, in cavi- 
t ies in the granite. Professor Jameson, to whom we owe the dis- 
covery of this gem in Arran, has, we understand, in his cabinet, 
crystals nearly an inch in length, of a mountain green colour, still 
attached to the graphic granite, so frequent in our glens. Beau- 
tiful crystals of the sub-gem-named Pistacite occur in veins in the 
slate quarry of Glen Halimidel. There is art extensive vein of 
sulphate of barytes at Sannox, which is seen traversing the channels 
both of North and South Sannox rivers ; and therefore, in all pro- 
bability, runs along the whole intervening space. This mineral 
bears, at present, a high price in the market. Accordingly, the 
proprietor, stimulated by the remarks of two well known practical 
chemists from Glasgow, who visited the Island of Arran in 1836, 
has recently opened a regular barytes quarry at Sannox, and erect- 
ed in its neighbourhood a large mill, in which the mineral is pul- 
verized, purified, and thoroughly prepared for the market. The 
quarry is situated within a mile of the sea shore. 

The Holy Isle, which forms part of this parish, is-composed prin- 
cipally of clinkstone, which rises to the top of the island in ranges 
of rude columns, placed over each other, and rests below upon a 
basis of red sandstone, with a stratum of white sandstone inter- 
posed between it and the columns. On the south and east side of 
the island, there are several veins of greenstone and basaltic por- 
phyry. Of the latter, some are seen to intersect not only the 
sandstone strata, but also those of columnar clinkstone which rest 
on them. 

Soil. — The cultivated soil in this parish is in general light ; 
and best adapted to turnip husbandry. In the valleys, which are 
of considerable extent, it varies greatly in kind and quality. In 
many places close to the shore, it is little else than granitic sand 
washed down from the mountains to the sea, and driven back by 
the sea upon the land. In other places, it is a fine alluvial loam, 
or land originally moss and marsh, but, by draining and cultivation, 
converted into a good black mould. The loam is in most places 
more or less mixed with gravel, and interspersed with patches of 
moss. On the rising grounds between the level parts of the val- 



KILBRIDE. 



11 



leys and the hills, there are usually from five to ten inches of loam 
mixed with gravel, resting for the most part upon close red till. 
The land in such places is therefore cold and spouty ; and would 
be materially benefited by furrow-drains and the subsoil plough. 
The extensive tracts of table-land between the promontories con- 
tain a considerable portion of the same kind of loam that is found 
in the valleys ; but their predominating soil is a mixed loam of 
moss and red friable clay. In the narrow belts of land which are 
situated between the shore and those rocky banks which skirt so 
much of the coast, the soil presents great varieties. Sometimes it 
is sand mixed with sea-shells ; sometimes moss resting upon marl. 
In the south, about Whitingbay, much of it is shingle, or light 
sandy loam, with red clay marl under it. The parish contains very 
few farms presenting much uniformity of soil. It sometimes hap- 
pens that the same field presents one patch of stiff clay, another 
of soft moss, and another of loam or gravel, or both mixed to- 
gether, with as many kinds of subsoil resting under them. 

Zoology. — 1. Qiiadriipeds. — At one period, when wood was 
abundant, roes, wild boars, and red-deer were very numerous in the 
parish. Of these, the two former were long ago extirpated ; and 
the last are now reduced to a few dozens, which are rarely seen 
except in the most retired recesses of the mountains in the north 
of the island. The Duke of Hamilton placed a pair of small 
American deer, a few years ago, in the pleasure grounds about 
Brodick Castle. They appear to thrive well, and have already a 
numerous offspring, which roam at large among the plantations. 
Hares and rabbits are very plentiful, and there are a few wild 
goats. Few quadrupeds of prey ever found their way to Arran. 
It contains some wild cats, but polecats, badgers, stoats, weasels, 
and squirrels were never seen in it. It contained foxes at one 
time, but they are now extirpated. The brown rat is very com- 
mon, and commits great depredations in the dwelUng-houses and 
barn-yards. Of amphibious quadrupeds, seals and otters are oc- 
casionally seen along the shores. 

2. Fishes. — The rivers of the parish abound in trouts and eels, 
but they are generally small in size. With a view to the improve- 
ment of the former, minnows were brought a few years ago from 
Ayrshire, and put in the several rivers and lakes of Arran. The 
result of the experiment cannot for some time yet be ascertained. 
When the rivers are swollen in summer, salmon and sea-trout as- 
cend in considerable numbers, when they are caught both with the

rod and the net; the latter, however, is used at the mouths of the 
rivers only. The sea along the coast abounds in valuable fish. 
The kinds most commonly found are whitings and haddocks ; but 
cod, ling, mackerel, conger-eels, skate, flounders, soles, and tur- 
bots, with a variety of smaller fishes, are also often caught. Lob- 
sters and crabs, and great varieties of other shell-fish, are to be 
found along every part of the coast, but are most abundant at the 
south end of the parish, and in the neighbourhood of Pladda. 
Oysters are got only at Lochranza. Herrings pay short occasional 
visits to all parts of the coast, but their favourite haunts are on the 
west and north sides of the island, in the sound of Kilbrandon, be- 
tween Arran and Carradale. They generally make their first ap- 
pearance in July, and remain till the end of November. Those 
cured in the months of August and September are considered the 
best. 

3. Reptiles. —The reptiles most commonly found in the parish 
are the nimble lizard, the blind dome, the adder, the warty-eft, 
the water-eft, the brown-eft or ask, the common frog, the edible 
frog, and the toad. The writer has not seen any of the venomous 
toads described by Pennant as natives of Arran ; but the people of 
Lochranza declare that they are often seen in that quarter, and 
describe them as rough on the back, corpulent in shape, and from 
six to eight inches in length. 

4. Birds. — These are very numerous, and in great variety. Of 
Tand birds, the most conspicuous and important are the red and 
black grouse, both of which are very abundant, and the latter so 
fond, of descending to the low grounds, as seriously to annoy the 
farmer in spring and harvest. The ptarmigan is occasionally found 
near the summits of the granite mountains. Pheasants, which 
were introduced some years ago, are now numerous about Brodick, 
and are gradually spreading over the whole of the parish. Eagles, 
fivlcons, hawks of various species, hooded and carrion crows, ravens, 
owls, and magpies, were at one time very numerous, and are still 
to be met with, but the premiums given by the Duke of Hamil- 
ton for destroying them have nearly effected their extirpation. 
Other birds, however, especially the smaller ones, have increased 
in proportion, to the serious loss of the lovers of cherries, straw- 
berries, and other garden fruits. Among these may be mentioned 
as very common, the ring-dove, the rock-dove, the cuckoo, the 
swallow, the martin, the sand-martin, the swift, the missel-thrush, 
the common thrush, the red-wing thrush, the fieldfare,, the whin-

chat, the redbreast, the hedge and house-sparrow, the wagtail, 
white, gray, and yellow, the yellow-hammer, the common bun- 
ting, the linnet, the chaffinch, the common wren, and the most 
pestilent and numerous of the whole the moor-blackbird. The 
rarer land birds are, the kestril, the goatsucker, the ring-thrush, 
the water-ousel, the wheat-ear, the golden-crested wren, the gold- 
finch, and the starling. Among the waders, those which occur 
most frequently are the curlew, the corncrake, the woodcock, the 
snipe, the lapwing, the green-plover, the ringed-plover, and the 
oyster-catcher. The bittern is met with occasionally. A beauti- 
ful specimen of this bird was shot in a swamp below the White- 
house a few years ago. Among the loater birds which frequent 
the coast, the following, occur : the cormorant, the shag or scart, 
the solan goose, the mallard or duck, the teal, the wild goose, the 
razor-bill, the puffin, the northern diver, the common gull, the 
silver gull, the guillemot, and the tern. Of these, the gull and 
the scart are among the most numerous. 

5, Insects. — To one conversant with such subjects, the entomo- 
logy of Arran would furnish materials for a volume. Presenting 
on its mountain tops the atmosphere and temperature of the 
Alps ; and in its wooded glens and sheltered valleys, a climate 
nearly as mild as Devonshire, its insect races are as varied as its 
physical character. Among these, the most interesting are its 
beetles, butterflies, and moths. Of the first, two may be men- 
tioned as particularly deserving of notice, which are found in 
beauty and abundance near the manse and at Whitingbay, viz. 
Chrysomela fulgida and Cicindela campcstris. The following is a 
list of butterflies and moths, collected in Arran by Mr Connell, of 
the High School, Glasgow, during the month of July 1836. It 
was the most unfavourable July for the purpose in the memory of 
man, otherwise the list might have been greatly extended. 
Though it encroaches on the parish of Kilmorie, it is too valuable 
not to be presented whole. 

Cynthia cardui. Not common. Specimens taken near Brodick and King's Cove. 

Hipparchia blandina. An Arran specimen of this insect first announced to ento- 
mologists, the fact that it was a native of this country ; not common. Found 
near Brodick and Dugary.

locality was visited for a few minutes during five or six evening., 
the weather not permitting longer or more frequent visits.

the whole. A specimen of it is said to have been caught by the 
late Sir Patrick Walker near Brodick.

many sheltered spots in the hills, were covered with natural wood. 
There are still about 150 Scotch acres of such woods, scattered 
in patches of unequal size, rocky eminences, and the banks of 
streams, from Sannox to Knockankelly. They consist principally 
of oak, ash, birch, rowan, hazel, and alder. There are about 553 
Scotch acres under regular plantations. Of these about a dozen 
of acres are planted on the grounds round the Bay of Lamlash ; 
and all the rest at Brodick ; principally in the neighbourhood of 
the castle. Mr FuUarton has, within these few years, planted a 
considerable number of acres on his well-cultivated and picturesque 
property of Kilmichael. The plantations round the Castle of 
Brodick are of various ages. The oldest contain many large and 
stately trees ; and all, in whatever stage of growth, have a healthy 
and vigorous appearance. In these plantations, the prevailing 
trees are, Scotch, silver, and spruce firs; larch, oak, ash, elm, 
sycamore, and birch. In more favourable situations, these are in- 
terspersed with poplars, walnuts, chesnuts, and laburnums. By a 
very excellent arrangement, most of the stack and kail-yards in 
the parish have rows of forest trees planted round them. The 
thinnings of the plantations have of late years proved extremely 
serviceable to the people of Arran, by supplying them with pal- 
ing for their fences, and wood for their houses and farm imple- 
ments. The improvident destruction of the natural forests, which 
was for several generations allowed to go on without check, made 
wood not long ago so scarce in Arran, that the people had often to 
cross over to Ayrshire, with no farther errand than the procuring 
a stick to mend a cart or a plough. Now all such wants are sup- 
plied promptly at home, at little expense either of time or labour ; 
and by judicious management, there will in future be no lack of 
wood for any ordinary purposes. 

II. Civil. HiSTQHY. 

Accounts of the Parish. — Avery minute account of the parish of 
Kilbride and of the Island of Arran in general, is given in a work by 
the Rev. James Headrick, published in the year 1807. It embraces a 
"view of the mineralogy, agriculture, manufactures, andfisheries of 
Arran, with notices of its antiquities." A shorter but very accurate ac- 

• The lists in Botany and Concbology, and many of the facts stated under the head 
of Zoology, the writer owes to the kindness of his scientific friend, the Rev. David 
Landsborough of Stevenston. This gentleman has viewed the Island of Arran with 
the eye both of a poet and a man of science. His well-known poem » Arran con- 
tains many- beautiful and striking descriptions of Arran scenery, of whicli the writer 
would have made very liberal use, had the limits assigned him admitted ot it.

count of the island was lately drawn up by John Paterson, Esq. factor 
to His Grace the Duke of Hamilton ; and published in the thirty- 
first number of the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture. This account, 
while embracing all the topics discussed in the larger work of 
Headrick, is particularly valuable as a record of the numerous 
improvements recently made or at present in progress in Arran. 
It is accompanied by a neat and excellent map of the island. 

Land-owners. — The whole parish, except the farm of Kilmichael, 
is the property of His Grace the Duke of Hamilton, who is supe- 
rior of the whole island. The farm of Kilmichael belongs to 
John Fullarton, Esq., who resides on his property. The two farms 
of Corrigills are a recent purchase from the Marquis of Bute. 
The Duke of Hamilton's rental in this parish is L. 4412; and 
Mr FuUarton's farm is worth about L. 100 of yearly rent. 

Parochial Registers. — No register for deaths appears to havef 
ever been kept in the parish. Those for births and marriages 
commence in the year 1723, and come down to the present day ; 
but till a very recent period they do not appear to have been 
kept with much regularity. The records of the proceedings of 
the kirk-session go back to the year 1704: and at one time they 
were pretty voluminous. But the volume commencing with the 
year 1750, and most of its successors, were lost about thirty years 
ago, by a gentleman to whom they were very improperly lent, to 
gratify an idle curiosity by their perusal. 

Historical Events. — In glancing at these, it is impossible to se- 
parate the history of the parish of Kilbride from that of the Island 
of Arran in general. In its more remote periods, that history is 
to a very great extent a blank. From the character of those nu- 
merous remains which it everywhere presents, its erect columns 
its clay urns, its Druidical circles, and its sepulchral cairns with 
stone coffins, it would appear that the original inhabitants of Ar- 
ran were the ancient Britons, who, wherever they were establish- 
ed, left similar traces behind them. And it is now admitted by 
the best antiquarians, that these were all of them branches of the 
great Celtic family. During the two first centuries after the in- 
vasion of Agricola, the Caledonii, and in the third and fourth, the 
Picts, who were either cognate Celtic tribes, or perhaps the same 
people under a dilTerent name, mixed a little with the Scandina- 
vian race, appear to have occupied the Hebrides and the High- 
lands in general, and therefore the Island of Arran. In the be-

ginning of the sixth century, another Celtic race, a colony of Irish 
Scots, usually called the Dalriads, effected a settlement in the 
western districts of the Highlands, more especially Argyllshire ; 
and Arran lying so near Kintyre, which was their first settlement, 
would probably have formed an early part of their conquests. This 
race, in the course of the three following centuries, gradually ex- 
tended their power over the greater part of the mainland of Scot- 
land, to which they gave the name which it still retains. But the 
dominion of the Hebrides was wrested from them by the Scandina- 
vians ; who, after many previous piratical expeditions to these isles, 
began, towards the end of the ninth century, to form in them re- 
gular settlements. At length Harold Harfager, after establishing 
himself as King of Norway, and subduing Shetland and Orkney, ad- 
ded to his other conquests the whole of the Hebrides, south to the 
Isle of Man. Arran must ilien, if not before, have fallen under the 
Scandinavian yoke. From this period till the final cession of the He 
brides to the Kings of Scotland, Arran shared the fate of the rest, 
of these islands, which were ruled by chiefs, dependant sometimes 
on Norway, but more frequently on kings of the isles, who yielded 
to Norway more or less allegiance. What changes were effected 
on the early Celtic population of the isles, by the conquests of the 
North-men, it is impossible now to ascertain. But as the language 
of the Celts ultimately prevailed, it is evident that the Celtic blood 
continued all along to predominate in the great body of the peo- 
ple, whose language their conquerors gradually adopted. For 
some generations previous to the incorporation of the Hebrides 
with the dominions of the Scottish monarchy, Arran appears to 
have been in possession of one of the branches of the family of 
Donald, Lord of the Isles, probably the Macruaridhs, who ruled in 
Bute. Monro, Dean of the Isles, speaks of a monastery in the 
Holy Isle, opposite to Lamlash, said to have been built by one of 
the sons of Somerled, and endowed by him with the lands round 
the bay of Lamlash ; and Somerled himself is said to have built a 
castle in the same island. It would seem that Arran passed next 
into the family of the High Steward of Scotland. Shortly after 
the death of Somerled, Walter, the High Steward, got for himself 
some footing in the neighbouring island of Bute. He improv- 
ed this advantage, and stregthened his interest in Bute, by the 
marriage of Alexander, his son and heir, to the grand-daughter of 

" For an account of the origin of the Scots and Picts somewhat different from this 
and perhaps a more probable one, see Sir W. Betham's Gael and Cimbri.

Angus Macsomerled, supposed to have been then Lord of Bute. 
Angus and his three sons afterwards fell in battle, leaving, it 
would seem, no male issue behind them. On this, Alexander, the 
son of the steward, claimed in right of his wife the island of Bute, 
and, it is supposed, the island of Arran also. The claim was resist- 
ed by Ruaridh, son of Reginald, and grandson of Somerled ; but 
the Scots settled the dispute for a time by expelling Ruaridh, and 
seizing both Bute and Arran. Hence it seems a fair inference, 
that Arran as well as Bute formed part of the inheritance claimed 
and obtained by the heir of the High Steward. Complaints of these 
and similar encroachments of the Scots sent to the court of Nor- 
way, led to the celebrated expedition of King Haco in 1263. 
Alexander IH. then King of Scotland, vindicated the aggressions of 
his subjects, by claiming the whole of the Hebrides as an ancient 
appendage of the Scottish crown, unjustly wrested from his pre- 
decessors. In the appeal to the sword which ensued, Haco was 
at first successful. He recovered all the isles that had been con- 
quered by the Scots, and re-established Ruaridh in all the pos- 
sessions from which he had been expelled. He then assembled 
all his forces in the island of Ar.ran, whence proceeding with his 
land troops to the opposite coast of Ayrshire, while his fleet ad- 
vanced along the Frith of Clyde, he for a short time pursued with- 
out resistance his desolating career, till his decisive defeat at Largs, 
and the subsequent dispersion of his fleet by a storm, had so 
thoroughly annihilated his power in the Hebrides, that his suc- 
cessor was obliged to cede the whole of the Hebrides on easy terms 
to the Scottish crown. Li the arrangements which ensued, neither 
Arran nor Bute is mentioned among the possessions bestowed on 
any of the descendants of Somerled. Hence the probability is, 
that they both continued in the family of the High Steward. 

During the wars which were occasioned by the attempts of Edward I. 
of England to annex Scotland to his own dominions, the island of Ar- 
ran fell into the hands of the English, who, in 1306, held the Castle 
of Brodick under Sir John Hastjngs. Sir James Douglas and some 
other partizans of Bruce made an attempt to surprise the garrison, in 
which some say they were successful, though others, probably upon 
better grounds, consider that they were foiled, at least till Bruce him- 
self joined them. This memorable event occurred in the year 1306. 
After passing a solitary winter as an exile and fugitive in Rachrin, 
in the north of Ireland, Bruce sallied forth in spring from his hid- 

 Gregory's History of tlie Highlands of Scotland.

ing-place, to hazard another stake for his crown and kingdom, and 
landed in Arran with a few but faithful followers,' in a small fleet 
of thirty-three row-boats. History dwells with minute fondness on 
this part of the monarch's adventurous career.; his landing on the 
west side of the island ; his waiting with Douglas and those of his 
partisans who preceded him, by whom he was recognized by the 
blowing of his horn ; his occupations during his stay ; and his en- 
terprising voyage to the mainland, on beholding the fire on Turn- 
berry Head, which, though not the signal light which he deemed it, 
proved in the result the dawn of his prosperous fortunes, in esta- 
blishing the liberties and independence of his country. Several me- 
morials of the Bruce still remain in the island of Arran. The 
King's Cove on the west coast ; Dairy, or the King's plain ; Torari" 
righ, or the King's mount, and King Cross, whence he embarked for 
the coast of Carrick, are places said to have all received their 
names from their connection with Bruce. Some of the names may 
perhaps be otherwise accounted for. But other and less doubtful 
traces of Bruce are furnished by grants of land which he made to 
several of the natives, for services rendered him while in the island. 
Mr Fullarton of Kilmichael is the lineal descendant of one of 
these, Feargus Macloy or Maclewis. He still possesses the char- 
ter for his lands given to his ancestor, which is signed by Robert 
11. and dated Arnele, 26th November, in the second year of his 
reign. The lands granted to others on the same occasion have 
passed long ago out of the hands of their descendants, and now 
form parts of the property of the Duke of Hamilton. For rea- 
sons already adverted to, it is probable that the principal proprie- 
tor in Arran was at this time the High Steward of Scotland, At all 
events, it unquestionably belonged to him in the next generation, 
when, by the failure of male heirs to Bruce, the High Steward, 
under the title of Robert II., ascended the Scottish throne. Arran 
by this event became part of the patrimony of the crown ; and its 
inhabitants, having taken up arms on this occasion in behalf of their 
master, they were freed from the annual tribute of corn which they 
formerly paid, and granted many other privileges. In conjunction 
with the men of Bute, they constituted the celebrated Brandani, 
who afterwards acted as the King's body guard. The island of 
Arran was at that period mostly covered with wood, and richly 
stocked with deer, foxes, and other animals of the chase. Hence 
it became a favourite resort of the Stewart kings in their 
hunting excursions. The castle of Lochranza, the walls of which 
still remain sufficiently entire to attest its former magnificence, was 



KILBRIDE. 21 



built by one of the Stewart kings as a hunting-seat. Fordun men- 
tions it as a royal castle in 1380. In the expedition which the 
Earl of Ross fitted out in 145.5, under his kinsman Donald Bal- 
loch of Islay, to support the Earl of Douglas against his sovereign, 
Arran suffered severely under this fierce marauder. He earned 
off from this island and the Cumrays a great deal of plunder ; and, 
after storming the castle of Brodick, levelled it to the ground. In 
the next reign, when the house of Boyd were the principal fa- 
vourites at court, Arran became for a short time the property of 
Sir Thomas Boyd, to whom the King gave his eldest sister the 
Princess Margaret in marriage, with the island of Arran, then 
erected into an earldom as her marriage portion. On the disgrace 
of the Boyds, Sir Thomas Boyd was divorced from his royal 
spouse, and the King selected as her second husband the Lord 
Hamilton, the heir of a family of Norman extraction, for many 
generations before distinguished in the annals of Scotland; and 
which, during the former reign, rose rapidly into influence and im- 
portance, by their seasonable espousal of the royal cause against the 
house of Douglas. The titles and estates of Arran, thus transferred 
to the family of Hamilton, have continued ever since in their pos- 
session, with the exception of a short period in the reign of James 
VI., when, through the oppressive proceedings of the Regent Mor- 
ton, they became forfeited to the crown, and were afterwards for 
a few years usurped by the court minion. Captain James Stewart. 

In 1.544, when Henry VIII. of England sought to punish the 
Scots for their refusal to enter into his scheme of uniting the sis- 
ter kingdoms by the marriage of his son Edward to the Princess 
Mary of Scotland, one of his warlike measures was sending an ex- 
pedition against the west coast of Scotland, under the Earl of 
Lennox. On his arrival there, Lennox's first proceeding was an 
attack upon the Island of Arran, from which he carried away 
much plunder, after demolishing the Castle of Brodick. Twenty 
years later, the Earl of Sussex, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 
provoked by the frequent incursions of the Scottish islanders into 
the north of Ireland, and the support which they gave to their 
countrymen settled there, in their opposition to the authority of 
the English viceroys, landed with ii considerable force in Kinlyre, 
then in possession of the Macdonalds, the principal objects of his 
resentment. When he had sufficiently gratified his cupidity and 
revenge by his ravages in that district, he steered his course to 
Brodick Bay in Arran, where landing, he desolated with fire and 



22

sword all the neighbouring country. The last time that Arran 
saw an enemy on its soil, was during the temporary occupation of 
Scotland by the usurper Oliver Cromwell. He placed a garri- 
son of eighty men in Brodick Castle, and strengthened it by 
raising on its north side a bartisan, which' still remains. His 
troops fell victims to the angry passions of the Highlanders. It 
would appear that they used some improper liberties with the fe- 
males of the island, and otherwise conducted themselves with the 
usual license of conquerors. The Highlanders, fired by such in- 
su ts, watched their opportunity for revenge; and, taking the Eng- 
lishmen by surprise when out on a foraging excursion, thev put them 
all to the sword. The last of the party that fell was dragged forth 
from his concealment under a large stone near the road side at 
Sannox, which still, from its remarkable appearance, attracts the 
notice of visitors. 

Antiquities — This parish abounds in relics of antiquity. Among 
these the first place is, from its importance, due to the Castle of 
Brodick. It is believed that there was a fort on the present site 
of the castle as far back as the occupancy of the island by the 
Danes. During the stormy periods of Scottish history it was so 
often demolished that it is probable that no part of the original 
structure is now standing. But part of it is unquestionably\ery 
old ; more especially a high and massy quadrangular building to 
its north -east side, which bears every mark of the architecture of 
those times of feudal warfare and disorder, when every castle was 
a stronghold, and strength and security were more valuable pro- 
perties of a habitation than comfort and convenience. The castle 
is still inhabited. Somewhat more than a century ago, the Duchess 
Ann of Hamilton made an addition to it on the west side, which, 
with a few alterations on the older parts of the building, has render- 
ed it a tolerably commodious habitation. It is occasionally the 
residence of the Hamilton family, during their visits to Arrau at 
the shooting season. The castle still retains much of its ancient 
feudal appearance. The large court behind the castle, with the 
high and thick wall enclosing it, still remains. And the broad 
and deep moat, which at one time protected it on one side, can 
easily be traced along the whole line of its compass. 

Relics of much earlier times than the feudal are presented in 
many parts of the parish. Some of these are, however, disappearing 
every year before the attacks of the pickaxe and the plough. Last 
year a double circle of those erect stones, usually called Druidical, 



KILBRIDE. 



23 



which stood on the farm of South Sannox, was used as building- 
materials for a dry dike ; and, about twenty-four years ago, a 
very complete circle at the mouth of Glensheraig was remov- 
ed, in clearing the field in wlch it stood for the operations 
of the plough. But there are imperfect remnants of circles still 
to be seen\t the top of Blarmore glen, at the head of Glencloy, 
and in some other places. Many erect monumental stones or 
columns still remain in the parish. The largest of these, which is 14 
feet high, stands onthelower side of the road at Brodickwood ; and 
at Glenshant, Sannox, Mayish, and Largiemore, others of the 
same description appear, either singly or in irregular groups. Per- 
haps a few of them may be remnants of circles. Of the sepulchral 
cairn, there are one or two specimens not far from the manse, on 
the farm of Blarmore ; but the largest which the writer has 
examined is one of more than 200 feet in circumference, at the 
head of Moniemore glen. From its position, on a plain of con- 
siderable extent, near the mouth of a narrow pass, between the 
east and west side of the island, it is probable that this was the 
scene of a battle ; and that the cairn was erected to cover the 
ashes of those who fell in the engagement. A considerable pari 
of the stones was carried away two years ago, for building a dike 
in the neighbourhood; and as those on the surface were removed, 
several stone coffins, each composed of six unhewn flags, were 
found under them. Similar coffins are every year met with, in 
cutting drains and ditches, in different parts of the parish, some- 
times connected with cairns and sometimes not. There is a large 
collection of them on a narrow plain near the shore at Largiebeg. 
In some of them, when opened, there were found rude urns of un- 
baked clay, containing ashes. One turned up last year in the 
iieicrhbourhood of the manse contained human bones. And in 
another, which a man at South Kiscadale fell in with several 
years ago, in making a fence round his garden, there was found a 
piece of gold in the form of a handle of a drawer thus a-., with 
some iron or steel, much corroded, at each end. The man con- 
cealed his prize, till he got it disposed of to a jeweller in Glasgow, 
who melted it down into rings and brooches. It was, therefore, 
never submitted to the eye of any experienced antiquary, to ascer- 
tain either its age or probable use. From the description given of 
it, the probability is that it was the guard of a sword handle. 
There are in different places in the parish, what appears to be ves- 
tiges of ancient forts. One of these is on Tornanshiain Gaelic, 



24 



BUTESIIIUE. 



the fairy's mound, in Glencloy, where it is understood that those 
of Bruce's partisans, who arrived in Arran before himself, took 
shelter, while the English held Brodick Castle in its neighbourhood. 
Another is Dunfiunn, or Fingal's fort, situated on a round emi- 
nence of considerable elevation, near the point of Clachlands. 
Headrick conjectures that this was one of those- vitrified forts so 
common in the north Highlands. No traces of vitrification now 
appear. The site of the wall by which it was surrounded can still 
be traced. 

In glancing at these faint vestiges of ancient times, it would be 
unpardonable to omit the case of St Molios, in the Holy Isle. 
Molios or, as the name means in Gaelic, the shaved servant of 
Jesus, was a disciple of St Columba, who, not considering the dis- 
cipline of lona sufficiently rigid, retired for greater seclusion from 
the vices of the world, to this lonely isle, whence he diffused the 
light of Christianity among the formerly Pagan inhabitants of 
Arran. The cave which formed his residence is merely an exca- 
vation in the red sandstone, hollowed out by the sea, when its 
level was higher than at present, with its mouth defended by a wall 
of loQse stones. On the roof of the cave there is a Runic inscrip- 
tion, stating the name and office of the saint, and a little raised 
above its floor, a shelf of rock, said to have been his bed. In the 
neighbourhood of the cave, there is a large flat stone, called his 
dining-table, and a spring of pure water his bath much resorted 
to in the ages of superstition, and celebrated for the healing vir- 
tues alleged to have been communicated to it by the prayers and 
blessings of the saint. Martin speaks of a curious stone bequeathed 
by this saint, and long famed for its many miraculous properties ; 
more especially its power in curing diseases, and protecting in 
battle the lives of its fortunate possessors. This stone was so care- 
fully transmitted as a valuable heir-loom from one generation to 
another, that it was lost only within these few years, by being com- 
mitted to the custody of a gentleman who partook too much of 
the scepticism of the age to have any faith in its virtues. It re- 
tained, however, some share of its credit, till its final disappearance. 
Some, even of the present generation, have had recourse to it for 
the cure both of man and beast. This esteemed relic was a smooth 
green globe, probably of jasper, about the size of a goose egg. 
About a mile north from St Molio's cave, and near the house of 
the present tenant of the Holy Isle, stood the monastery spoken 
of by Dean Monro. Even in the time of the dean himself 1594, 

4 



KILBRIDE. 



25 



the monastery was in ruins ; but the consecrated ground on which 
it stood was for many generations after him used as a burying-place 
by the people of Arran. The cause of its abandonment was the 
loss of a number of people who were accompanying a funeral to this 
place. The boat which carried them was upset by one of those sud- 
den and violent squalls of wind with which the bay of Lamlash is 
in unsettled weather so often visited. The situation of this burying- 
place was pointed out by a number of rude tombstones which lay 
in heaps upon the ground ; till two years ago, a modern utilitarian, 
who had none of Di~ Johnson's reverence for sacred places, cleared 
the spot, and turned the bones and ashes of the dead to account, 
by rearing from them a crop of onions and carrots. Besides the 
religious house in the Holy Isle, there was, previous to the Refor- 
mation, a small church or chapel at Kilmichael in Glencloy, the 
foundations of which were raised only a few years ago. There 
was also a church at South Sannox, dedicated to St Michael. 
The only vestige of it now remaining is a rude image of its patron 
saint, which has been preserved, by being built up in the wall of 
the church-yard, which is still used as a burying-place. 

Modern Buildings.— Theve are no modern buildings in the pa- 
rish that call for particular remark. The few genteel families in 
the parish, and the more substantial farmers, occupy houses simi- 
lar to those of the same class in other parts of the country. Dur- 
ing the last few years, several neat slated cottages have been built 
in different parts of the parish ; more especially round the bay of 
Brodick, for the accommodation of summer visitors. The smaller 
tenants live in houses much superior in appearance and comfort 
to those which they occupied twenty years ago. But many of 
them are still very indifferent habitations : the majority of them 
being built with dry stones, and thatched with straw or heather, 
made secure against storms with ropes of heather fastened by wood- 
en pins. at 

III. — Population. 

The population in 1755 was 1369 
1793 2545 
1801 2183 
1821 2714 
1831 2656 
■ 1835 2.397 

From this table it appears that, between 1755 and 1793, the popula- 
tion of the parish had nearly doubled. The cause was, a very injudi- 
cious system which then prevailed, of allowing the tenants on every 
farm to multiply without check, the share of a farm occupied by 



26 



nTJTRsiiinE. 



the father being, as his family grew up and settled in life, often 
divided among two or three of his sons. The decrease from 1793 
to 1801, was principally owing to the number of young men who 
then went to sea ; several hundreds leaving the parish every year, 
some for the Royal Navy, others for the bounty fishing, and others 
on board merchant ships. Of these very few ever returned to their 
native parish ; as many of them were ei'ther lost at sea, or fell in 
the service of their country, and those who lived, settled in the 
different sea-port towns in the low country. From 1801 to 1821 
the same cause continued to operate in keeping down the popula- 
tion ; but the continuation of the old system of subdividing farms, 
with the greater abundance of the necessaries of life arising from 
the additional land brought under cultivation, produced in it, upon 
the whole, a slight increase. Its gradual decline from that period 
till the present day has arisen from several causes. Of these, the 
most important are an extensive emigration to Canada and Chaleur 
Bay, which took place in 1830 ; the care taken to prevent any farther 
splitting down of possessions ; the decline in smuggling, which, at 
one time, afforded a sort of occupation for a great number of young 
men ; and increased habits of industry in the rising generation, 
who, instead of following the old practice of loitering half idle at 
home, go to trades or service in the low country, or engage as 
sailors in merchant ships. 

Language, Manners, Morals. — English is well understood, and 
more or less spoken in all parts of the parish : but among the ru- 
ral population, Gaelic is decidedly the prevailing language. In the 
villages, which contain a number of settlers from the mainland, 
English is rapidly gaining ground, and is spoken by the rising 
generation with the same fluency as Gaelic. From the nearness 
of Arran to the mainland, and the constant intercourse with it 
maintained of late years, the people exhibit in their manners a cu- 
rious mixture of the Highlander and Lowlander. With the bland 
courtesy of the former, and that seemingly artless simplicity which 
so often hides under it a great share of shrewdness, intelligence, 
and art, they have learned to blend no inconsiderable share of the 
bluff and sturdy independence of the latter. The Highland charac- 
ter, however, decidedly predominates. The practice of illicit distil- 
lation prevailed very generally not many years ago. But the heavy 
fines imposed of late on convicted delinquents, and the diminution 
of the gains of smuggling by the improvement of the spirits ma- 
nufactured by the licensed distiller, have in a great measure put 



Kll.BRlDE. 



2T 



an end to this demoralizing traffic. Still the most upright of the 
common people are disposed to view it, if at all a breach of the 
Divine law, as at least a very venial one. The encouragement 
given by the proprietor to agricultural improvements has given a 
great impulse to the industry of the people. But in this respect 
they are still far behind their neighbours on the Ayrshire coast. 
Nor can they be expected to match them, till, by the enlargement 
of the size of the farms, and the gradual removal of the surplus 
population, provision is made for affording them steady and profi- 
table occupation. The want of regular work gives time for much 
idle talk. Accordingly, the most trifling article of intelligence 
flies with rail-road speed from one extremity of the parish to the 
other. The ancient games and amusements of Highlanders have 
disappeared, and have almost ceased to be even matters of tradi- 
tion. Highland superstitions are also rapidly on the decline ; though 
the belief in ghosts, witches, and fairies, has still a firm hold of 
the minds of many ; and the power of the evil eye is a very general 
article of faith. They have still a number of traditions about Fin- 
gal, or as they call him Fiunn MacCoul, and his heroes, whom 
they speak of as a race of gigantic warriors and hunters. These 
traditions agree better with those which prevail in the north of 
Ireland, than with the more refined and poetical tales of Macpher- 
son's Ossian, In some of these St Patrick occupies a prominent 
place. The people in general are very temperate and chaste 
Among the rural population, there is perhaps not one habitual 
drunkard. It is to be lamented, however, that intemperance is 
fast gaining ground among the sailors in the parish, and such of 
the tradesmen as earn high wages. Of the latter, the majority 
are from the mainland, whence they import the prevailing vices of 
the lower orders in our large towns along with them. The num- 
ber of illegitimate births is small ; and perhaps the half of these 
is occasioned by the intercourse of the parish with the mainland, 
whence girls, who repair to it for service, occasionally return in 
a state of pregnancy. No people can be more frugal than the na- 
tives of the parish. They live upon the humblest fare; potatoes 
are with the majority of them the staff" of life ; and animal food is a 
luxury in which they rarely indulge. In dress the more, aged of 
both sexes have departed very little from the unadorned simplicity 
of their progenitors ; but the young very generally follow the 
fashions which prevail among their own class in the mainland, the 
softer sex as elsewhere taking the lead. On Sabbath, the church 



28 



BUTESHIRE. 



presents tlie same array of silks, laces, and bonnets as meets the 
eye in a low country congregation. With prudent thrift, however, 
the more considerate of them sometimes carry their fine shoes and 
stockings in their laps till they approach the church. A very ex- 
cellent feature in their character is the strength of their domestic 
affections. The wages of the children are, after a suitable deduc- 
tion for their wardrobes, almost always at the disposal of their pa- 
rents, to assist in paying their rents, and supporting them under 
the privations and infirmities of declining years. 

Religion. — In point of religious information, the people in gene- 
ral are on a level with those in the same sphere of life in the low 
country. There being but one parish church for a population 
spread along a coast seventeen miles in length, the attendance 
ipon public ordinances is not so regular as could be wished. But 
the great bulk of the young and rising generation are in this re- 
spect, upon the whole, very exemplary. Many of the more aged 
are kept from church by distance and the infirmities of declining 
years. But there is a considerable proportion of them, though 
their number is gradually diminishing, who are absent from choice ; 
having several marked peculiarities of sentiment and character, 
which render the style of preaching, generally acceptable among 
well-educated Christians, unpalatable to their taste. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture and Rural Economy. — The parish being mostly oc- 
cupied by lofty hills and mountains, the arable part of it bears 
but a small proportion to the extent of its surface ; and is confined 
to the glens and valleys, and the more level parts of the declivities 
which skirt the bottoms of the hills. Cultivation is carried in very 
few places more than 200 feet above the level of the sea. The 
number of Scotch acres at present under cultivation is 4270 ; and 
the number considered capable of cultivation about 800. The 
parish is divided into 208 farms of very unequal size ; and of these 
161 are under L. 20 of rent ; 30 above L. 20, and under L. 40 ; 
11 above L. 40, and under L. 100 ; and 6 above L. 100. 

Rent of Land. — Arable land rents, according to its quality, from 
5s. to L. 2 per acre, averaging about L. 1, 5s. The average rate 
of grazing a cow in summer, and foddering her in winter, is L. 4, 
10s. The rent of a cottar's house is L. 2 per annum. 

Rate of Wages. — Farm-servants are usually hired by the half- 
year. Exclusive of board, men-servants receive from L. 6 to L. 8, 
10s.; and women from L. 2, 10s. to L. 4. Male labourers en- 



KILTRIDE. 



29 



oaaed by the day receive in summer from Is. 6d. to 2s. without 
victuals ; and females from 8d. to lOd. In winter, labourers gene- 
rally work by the piece ; and when engaged by the day, generally 
receive the same allowance as in summer. Reaping m harvest is 
paid at the rate of 10s. per acre, without victuals. Masons and 
carpenters when they work by the day charge 3s. with victuals, 
and 3s. 6d. without them. The rates of mason and other me- 
chanical work, when done by contract, are as follows : Building 
ruble walls and carriage per rood of 36 yards, from L. 5, 8s. to 
L.5, 10s. ; hewing per foot, including quarrying and price of stones 
7d. ; plastering per square yard, including lime and sand, 5d. ; 
flagging per square yard, 2s. lOd. ; diking, per rood of 19 feet, 
5s. ; slating with Easdale slates, large size, per rood, L. 3, 15s. ; 
do. under° size, L. 2, 14s. ; roofing per rood, with American 
pine, including sawing and nails, L. 6, lOs. ; with Scotch fir, L. 4, 
7s. ; sawing per 100 feet, 4s. 7d. ; windows per foot, from 23. 
4d. to 2s. 6d.; bound doors, full mounted, from 14s. to L. 1 ; 
farm-carts with iron axle-tree, from L. 9 to L. 9, 10s. ; with 
wooden axle-tree, from L. 7, lOs. to L. 8 ; iron ploughs, L.5; 
wooden ploughs, L. 1, 14s. ; a pair of harrows complete, L. 1, 
8s. ; wheelbarrows, from 18s. to L. 1. 

Breeds of Live- Stock.— The sheep reared on the hills are all 
of the black-faced kind. A few Cheviots and Merinos are oc- 
casionally pastured on the lower grounds. The cattle are chiefly 
of the Highland Argyllshire breed; for the improvement of which, 
bulls, the°property of the landlord, are distributed at convenient 
distances among the smaller tenantry. The more opulent farmers, 
besides their Argyllshire stock for rearing, keep cows of the Ayr- 
shire breed for a dairy stock ; with which they have succeeded 
well, their cheese and butter bearing a fair comparison with the 
produce of the best dairy districts of Ayrshire. In cattle and dairy 
produce, the small tenants, though- rapidly improving, are still far 
behind ; as they have hitherto attended too httle to the proper ro- 
tation of crops, and the sowing down of their lands for pasture, 
with clover and rye-grass. Their sheep in the hills are also dimi- 
nutive in size ; but they take on flesh very readily, and make most 
excellent mutton, when transported to the more luxuriant pastures 
of the mainland. 

Husbandry. —In this department, the parish of Kilbride and the 
Island of Arran in general, have been improving of late years with 
rapid strides ; and there is, perhaps, no place even in the He- 



30 BUTKSIIIRE. 

brides, where improvement was more urgently needed. Till the 
year 1815, all the lands in the island were let in farms of con- 
siderable size, which a number of tenants, varying from four or 
five to ten or a dozen, occupied in common, and cultivated accord- 
ing to what IS called the runrig system; none having the same 
ng for two years in succession, except after the potatoe crop. The 
arable land was divided into outfield and infield. The outfield 
which was that next the hills, got a little manure the year it was 
broken up from lea ; but none afterwards. The only grain sown 
in It was oats ; of which crop after crop was raised, till the ground 
was thoroughly run out. It was then allowed to rest, yielding for 
several years nothing but weeds; and as soon as "these began to 
disappear by the return of grass and heather, it was again broken 
up to undergo the same exhausting process of croppino-. In the 
cultivation of the infield land, the system pursued was equally in- 
judicious. No regular rotation was followed ; but the general rule 
was, 1. oats ; 2. oats ; 3. potatoes and pease ; 4. bear with dung ; 5. 
pease ; 6. oats or mashlam ; 7. two years of pasture choked with 
weeds, unaided by sown grasses, and therefore deficient both in 
quality and quantity. The implements of husbandry were of the 
rudest description ; a harrow often made entirely of wood ; on 
many firms no carts, but cars or sledges in their stead ; and wood- 
en ploughs short in the stilts, clumsy in their whole construction, 
and drawn by four horses with a man leading them, and one or 
two following the plough with spades, to level the inequalities which 
it left in the furrows. 

In 1815, the whole of this miserable system of rural manage- 
ment was changed. The large farms, possessed formerly in com- 
mon, were subdivided into small lots, having each its own tenant. 
To every farm a small portion of hill formerly a common also 
was attached, and the quantity of stock to be placed on it precisely 
fixed. A rotation of crops was laid down. The proprietor gave 
plants for inclosing the arable land with thorn fences ; and allowed 
timber, lime, and in some cases a year's rent in money, for the erec- 
tion of proper dwelling-houses and steadings ; while, at once to 
stimulate and direct the industry of his tenantry, he planted in con- 
venient situations, here and there, a few large farmers of skill and 
capital, to whom he gave leases of nineteen years ; substantial 
slated dwelling-houses and farm-steadings ; and all the other ac- 
commodations usual in the more improved districts of Scotland. 
To improve the breed of cattle and sheep, a number of contigu-

ous farms, better adapted for grazing than cropping, were convert- 
ed into sheep-walks, and let to men ol" capital, skilled in the ma- 
nagement of store farms. Other stimulants to improvement have 
been more recently applied, by liberal allowances for the opening 
of drains ; and the subdividing of lots with fences ; the esta- 
blishment of a farmer's club, which gives premiums for ploughing, 
sheep, black-cattle, and general rural management. 

Improvements are accordingly going on now with spirit. The 
better class of farmers have introduced all the improved modes of 
husbandry which prevail in the more advanced agricultural districts, 
with horses, ploughs, thrashing-mills, &amp;c. to correspond. And 
hence their returns in produce are as good as the quality of the 
soil and nature of the climate will admit of. By the liberal use of 
bone manure, they are able to lay down their lands in good con- 
dition for summer pasture, and to feed cattle in winter with turnips 
and hay for the butcher. With the addition of furrow draining, 
which has been recently adopted by a few of the tenants, 
and the introduction of the' subsoil plough, their system of rural 
management would be complete. The smaller tenants have yet 
much to learn. They put little lime on their lands ; neglect the 
cleaning and protecting of their thorn fences ; evade the rotation 
of crops laid down for them when they can, and are not sufficiently 
alive to the advantages of green crops and sown grasses. Hence 
their fodder is scarce in winter, and their pasture defective in sum- 
mer ; and their cattle a stinted breed, unproductive either for the 
dairv or the butcher. Even in this class, however, there are se- 
veral very excellent farmers, who for horses and cows, farming im- 
plements, and produce of all kinds, will not suffer by being com- 
pared to those who farm on a larger scale. Nothing is wanted to 
place the agriculture of Arran on the most thriving footing, but 
to give encouragement to such meritorious farmers, by extending 
the duration of their leases from the present short term of seven 
to nineteen years, and enlarging their lots, as the lands around 
them fall out of lease. 

Produce. — Of the gross annual produce of the parish, it is diffi- 
cult to form a very accurate estimate. The following approxima- 
tion to it has been supplied by a gentleman intimately acquainted 
with the agricultural state of the parish : 

Wheat, 30 quarters. 
Barley and big, 947 do. 
Oats, '2727 do. 
Beans and pease, 495 do. 

Potatoes, 41 7G bolls, of 12 imperial bushels each.

V. — Pauochial Economy. 
Market-Towns and Means of Communication. — There are no 
market-towns either in the parish or island. The people carry 
their cattle and produce to market to the different towns on the 
mainland; principally Saltcoats and Ardrossan; with which there 
is regular steam communication throughout the year. The Isle of 
Arran steam- packet plies between Arran and Ardrossan, twice a- 
week during the winter and spring months, and in summer daily. 
From the beginning of June till the end of September, the steam- 
boats of the Castle Company ply regularly between Glasgow 
and Arran twicea-week. There are two annaal fairs in the parish, one 
at Lamlash in the beginning of winter, and the other at Brodick, 
the last week of June. The Lamlash fair is thinly attended ; and 
any little business done at it, is almost exclusively confined to the 
selling and exchanging of horses. Brodick fair, though established 
only a few years ago, attracts great crowds both of the inhabitants 
of Arran, and people from the mainland ; and there is considera- 
ble business done at it, in horses, cattle, and wool. The post town 
is Saltcoats. In connexion with the post-office of that town, there 
are two subordinate offices in the parish of Kilbride, which com- 
municate with it daily, Sundays excepted, in summer and autumn, 
and twice a-week during the rest of the year. Perhaps no island in 
the Hebrides is better accommodated with roads. From Gortan 
Alister, a little south of Lamlash, to Brodick, there is a Parliamen- 
tary road, which was last year regularly macadamized, and is always 
kept in a state of excellent repair. In 1817, a line of road in 
continuation of this, made at the expense of the Duke of Hamil- 
ton, and kept in repair by the statute labour of the district, was 
carried from its northern termination as far as Sannox, and from 
its southern point round the whole of the southern and most va- 



KILBRIDE. 



33 



luable part of the island to the Blackwater river. There are also 
two excellent roads which communicate with the parish of KilmorieJ 
one made by the Duke of Hamilton from Lamlash to Benicarra- 
gan, in the district of Southend, and the other a Parliamentary road 
from Brodick to the Blackwater in the Chiskan district. To render 
the inland communication of the parish complete, it would be 
extremely advantageous to continue onward to Lochranza the road 
which terminates at Sannox, and to build a few additional bridges ; 
one over Ashdale Burn, and other two on the rivers of South and 
North Sannox. There are harbours at Lochranza, Corrie, Bro- 
dick, and Lamlash. The three latter have quays attached to them, 
but not of sufficient extent, being accessible to vessels only at high 
water. There was at one time an excellent quay at Lamlash 
fit to admit vessels of every size at all states of the tide. It was 
built in the time of the Duchess Ann of Hamilton, who planned 
it on such a scale, that though the wages of masons were then 
only 8d. and those of labourers 4d. per day, and the materials with 
which it was built quite at hand, the work cost L. 2913. By a 
piece of gross mismanagement, this admirable quay was some thirty 
or forty years ago allowed to be used as a quarry for erecting the 
village of Lamlash; — a measure of which the folly is now deeply 
felt, as the productive industry of the island is so greatly increased, 
and steam navigation has created so much intercourse between 
Arran and the mainland. The island cannot have that accommo- 
dation which its growing importance demands, till this gross blun- 
der is repaired by the erection of a proper quay at Brodick or 
Lamlash. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is situated at the south 
end of the village of Lamlash. It was built in the year 1773, and 
is a plain and unambitious building, without vestry, steeple, or bel- 
fry, quadrangular in form, with an aisle containing a small 
gallery opposite the pulpit, projecting from one of its sides. It 
contains about 560 sittings, which are all free, and, with the ex- 
ception of the seats of the two proprietors, the minister's family 
and two or three others, common to all the parishioners. There 
is no other place of worship connected with the Establishment 
actually within the bounds of the parish. But there is a chapel at 
Lochranza, near the northern extremity of the parish, at its point 
of junction with the parish of Kilmorie, in which a preacher of the 
Gospel officiates as assistant to the two ministers of Arran. He 
has the charge of a district in Kilbride parish, containing a popu- 

BUTE. c 



34 BUTESHIllE. 

lation of about 200. The provision for the support of the chapel 
is 500 merks Scots, mortified for the purpose by the Duchess Ann, 
with the interest of a sum formed by the accumulation of the sa- 
lary, during a vacancy of fifteen years, which occurred about twenty 
years ago. The district under the sole superintendence of the parish 
minister is seventeen miles in length ; and contains a population of 
nearly 2200 ; belonging, with a few trifling exceptions, to the Esta- 
bhshment. Of these, there are above 200 from nine to ten miles 
from the parish church ; 600 from four to six ; and 1600, more than 
two. In these circumstances, it is obvious, that though the pa- 
rish church is at present in nearly as central a situation for the whole 
population as could well be fixed upon, a large proportion of these 
are at such a distance as precludes either regular attendance upon 
ordinances on their part, or efficient pastoral superintendence on 
the part of the minister. Accordingly, both pastor and people 
are at present making efforts for getting an additional church and 
parish for the large and populous district round Brodick Bay. How 
they may succeed, it is difficult to say, as they are not in circum- 
stances either to build a church or support a minister without ex- 
ternal aid. The present church is generally full in good weather ; 
in summer sometimes uncomfortably so. But if the people were 
all within a convenient distance of the church, a house of twice 
the size might be filled. The communicants alone, who exceed 
600, would require more accommodation than the present church 
affords. The manse is beautifully situated on a sloping eminence 
about a mile north-east of the church, and commands a fine view 
of the bay, and of the opposite coast of Ayrshire. It is a substan- 
tial and commodious house, built in 1826. The glebe consists of 
about 19 Scotch acres, fences, roads, and church-yard included. 
When the present incumbent entered upon its possession, it was, 

 The above was written three years ago. Since that time an elegant and com- 
modious church has been built at Brodick. The expense of the edifice amounted to 
about L.830 fof which L.lOO was contributed by His Grace the Duke of Hamilton ; 
L. 167, 13s. by the Extension Committee of the General Assembly; nearly L. 150 
by the inhabitants of Brodick and summer visitors; and L.448 by the friends of re- 
ligion in the cities and large towns of the mainland, in subscriptions procured by the 
writer of this article. The cliurch was opened for public worship on the second 
Sunday of December 1839; and a parochial missionary attached to the district of 
Brodick now preaches in it regularly to a crowded congregation. Without an en- 
dowment from some quarter, however, it is to be feared that the services of an or- 
dained clergyman cannot be secured for it. In the meantime, the attendance at the 
parish church is considerably diminished. There is, however, abundance of popula- 
tion for filling both churches ; and it is to be hoped that all the spare romu will he 
occupied as soon as the increased facilities for pastoral superintendence, arisuig from 
the services of an additional labourer in the vineyard, have had time to tell upon the 
habits of the parishioners.

with the exception of a few patches, one uncultivated waste. It 
has since been drained, hmed, and subdivided, at an expense which 
the writer is ashamed to mention, as the soil is too light to remu- 
nerate him for his outlay. It would at present let at a rent of L. 20 
per annum. The stipend consists of 17 chalders, in equal pro- 
portions of barley and oatmeal, and payable according to the Bars 
of the county. The allowance for communion elements is L. 8, 
6s. 8d. 

The whole of the parishioners belong to the Established 
Church, with the exception of about forty individuals connected 
with the Congregational Union of Scotland. The last have a 
chapel at Sannox, containing about 260 sittings. Their minister, 
having scarcely any congregation of his own, draws his audiences 
principally from among those members of the Establishment who 
are unable to attend their parish church. On the evening of every 
third Sabbath, he preaches at the school-house at Brodick ; and 
one Sabbath in the three the whole day at Lochranza. He is prin- 
cipally supported out of the funds of the Congregational Union, 
and by religious societies, by which he is employed in itinerating 
through the Highlands for a few months every summer. He has 
a good house attached to his chapel. Both the house and the 
chapel were built by subscription about twenty years ago. 

Education. — There are at present 6 schools in the parish, be- 
longing exclusively to itself, and a seventh at Lochranza, common 
to Kilbride and Kilmorie. The maximum salary for parochial 
schools is distributed in unequal portions among four of these : 
Lamlash receiving L. 19 ; Brodick, L. 16 ; Corrie, L. 4 ; and 
Lochranza, L. 6, with nearly an equal sum from Kilmorie pa- 
rish. The other schools are, an Assembly school at Whiting 
Bay ; and a private school at Lamlash. At all the schools, 
the fees for teaching are the same as in the parochial schools 
of rural districts in the low country. The people, however, 
being generally poor, the amount of school-fees in the best at- 
tended of them does not exceed L. 14 per annum; in some, it 
is as low as L. 5. All the parochial teachers have schoolhouses, 
without rent, from the Duke of Hamilton ; and the Assembly 
teacher, the accommodations required by the rules of the Assembly 
Committee on schools. The salary of the Assembly teacher is 
L. 25. Whiting Bay has been singularly fortunate, in a suc- 
cession of excellent teachers, appointed by the Committee of the 
Assembly. The branches usually taught in the several schools

are, English and Gaelic reading, writing, English grammar, 
arithmetic, book-keeping, and navigation. Sabbath schools are 
established in all the districts of the parish. The majority 
of them are taught by the teachers of the. week-day schools ; 
a few of them by these, in conjunction with other pious and 
well-disposed individuals. These schools are conferring inesti- 
mable benefits, in rearing up the rising generation in right views 
of Divine truth, and correct rules of moral conduct. But they 
•would be much more extensively beneficial, both to teachers and 
taught, did the circumstances of the people admit of their provid- 
ing their children with those admirable text-books which are now 
in general use in well-conducted Sunday schools in the low coun- 
try. In winter and spring, the number of children who attend 
school in the parish averages about 450. In summer, many of 
them are employed in herding and field labour ; and therefore the 
attendance is much less. The advantages of education, however, 
are very generally appreciated ; and there are few, if any, above 
the age of six, who are not in the way 'of being taught to read. 
Still, it is a general complaint among the teachers, that children, 
during the time they are with them, are not obliged to give more 
punctual attendance at school ; and that they are allowed to quit 
school altogether, and, considering their education as finished, at 
too early an age for retaining permanently what they have been 
taught. 

Libraries. — In the year 1824, a few public-spirited individuals 
established a small Hbrary in the parish ; and to make it easily ac- 
cessible to all, the amount of the subscription was fixed at Is. per 
annum. There are, at present, about 80 subscribers, the majority 
of them young men of the working classes who enliven their long 
winter evenings by the perusal of its volumes. The subscriptions 
are collected once a-year at a general meeting, at which the new- 
books to be added to the collection are proposed and voted for. 
The collection, from the low amount of the subscriptions, consists 
as yet of only 300 volumes ; but these are well selected, and sup- 
ply several excellent works in history, biography, popular science, 
geography, and practical divinity. Most of the religious books, 
either originally composed in Gaelic, or translated into Gaelic 
from the English language, are found in the collection, and have 
always a great circulation among the more aged of the subscribers. 
The more wealthy of the parishioners occasionally make donations 
of books to the library.

Poor and Parochial Funds.— The average number of paupers, 
who receive regular parochial aid, is 50 ; among whom is distri- 
buted annually the sum of L. 60. They receive their respective 
allowances quarterly, in sums which vary from 3s. to 12s. to each, 
according to their several necessities. The average number of 
occasional paupers cannot be easily stated ; very few applying to 
the session for aid, except persons who wish to be placed regularly 
upon the roll. Taking the average of the last seven years, the 
amount of the church collections, including dues for mortcloth and 
marriage proclamations, has been L. 46, lis. 34d. The kirk-ses- 
sion has a small capital arising from bequests, lying at interest in 
Irvine Bank. Its present amount is L. 100 ; but it is yearly de- 
creasing, as the quarterly distributions in winter and spring con- 
siderably exceed the amount of the church collections at those sea- 
sons of the year. A number of the more destitute of the paupers re- 
ceive small pensions from His Grace the Duke of Hamilton. The 
amount of the pensions varies from L. 1 to L. 2 per annum ; and 
the majority of them is bestowed upon old men, and poor widows 
of good moral character. The sum distributed among them at 
the last annual term was L. 63, lis. Paupers have generally 
speaking lost much of the reluctance to appear on the session-roll 
which they at one time manifested ; and many of them are cla- 
morous for additions to their allowances. But none ever make ap- 
plication except persons really in destitute circumstances, and un- 
equal to their own support ; and such applicants would be greatly 
more numerous, and a heavier burden on the fund, were it not for 
the forward and liberal charity of neighbours and relations ; many 
of whom are themselves in circumstances little elevated above the 
objects of their willing bounty. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There are six public-houses in the pa- 
rish ; of which three are at Lamlash ; two at Brodick ; and one at 
Corrie. The largest of these is the inn at Brodick ; an old, but 
commodious house, much resorted to in summer by visitors to the 
Island of Arran. By its present respectable occupants, it is ex- 
ceedingly well kept ; and no person leaves it without being grati- 
fied by the assiduous attentions of its inmates. The other houses, 
though smaller, are very neat and clean, and occupied by families 
of respectable character and conduct. Their number, however, 
might be reduced, especially at Lamlash, to the obvious benefit of 
the morals df the people, and without any undue encroachment 
on the accommodation required for strangers. But the houses wbicla

call most loudly for ihe interference of the magistracy, arc small 
whisky shops in different parts of the parish, which contrive dex- 
terously to elude the scrutiny of the excise ; and afford the lovers 
of ardent spirits opportunities of indulging in their favourite beve- 
rage, without the public notice which they would incur by frequent 
visits to the licensed public-houses. 

Fuel. — The fuel of the labouring classes is generally peats. 
Every tenant has a right to cut peats in the hills ; and their only 
expense to him is the labour of cutting and carrying them home. 
In the wet climate of Arran, they are a very precarious kind of 
fuel; but their quality is in general excellent, and when secured 
in good condition, they are an excellent substitute for coals. 
Those in easy circumstances, for the most part, burn coals from 
Ayrshire. The freight usually charged is, from Ardrossan 4s. 
and from Ayr 5s. per ton of 24 cwt. ; and this, added to their price 
at the place of embarkation, makes them in general l4s. or 15s- 
per ton. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

It must be acknowledged that this parish is in many respec's 
very far behind the rural parishes on the mainland of Scotland. 
But there are probably few parishes in the kingdom, where the 
progress of improvement has of late been more rapid. In the year 
1793, when the former Statistical Account of the parish was written, 
it was, notwithstanding its proximity to the very centre of Scotch 
commerce and industry, in a state as rude and primitive as the 
most remote islands of the Hebrides. There were not at that time 
six carts in the whole parish. Of regularly formed road there was 
not a mile; nor a single bridge built with stone and lime. The 
houses of the tenantry and common people in general were the 
merest hovels ; and their clothes of the coarsest home manufacture. 
Their land was so unskilfully cultivated that its returns did not 
nearly afford them the requisite supply of food. Their cattle, 
though from their very diminutive size easily supported, died upon 
their hands in hundreds every severe spring. And they were them- 
selves, though like Highlanders in general courteous and respectful 
in their manners, greatly deficient in every branch of useful know- 
ledge. Many of the old were never taught to read ; and the ma- 
jority of both old and young could speak little or no English. The 
changes in all these respects, which have since that period occurred 
in the parish, the preceding pages have sufficiently exjilained. 

To 11 full justice to the capabilities of the parish, there are 



KILURIDE. 



39 



several other changes still imperatively called for. Of these the 
most important are, 1. Some additional wood for affording shel- 
ter to the more exposed farms, and improving the general ap- 
pearance of the parish j 2. The enlargement of the size of the 
farms, and the lengthening of the leases to nineteen years ; 3. 
Good quays at Lamlash and Brodick, so as to afford the parish- 
ioners the requisite facilities for carrying their produce to market. 

It is understood to be the wish of the proprietor, to preserve as 
much as possible the present character of the parish as a romantic 
rural retirement. Were his views different, there is no property 
in the west of Scotland, the value of which could be more easily 
increased. The attractions of its healthy climate and majestic 
scenery, make it even in its present state a place of considerable 
resort to summer visitors. Many of these, if they could get build- 
ing-leases, would erect villas in the parish, and perhaps reside in 
it the whole year. There would thus be a home market for much 
of the produce of the island that is at present carried out of it at 
considerable expense ; much additional employment got for the 
poor and working classes ; and the foundation laid for converting 
the village of Lamlash into a thriving town of tradesmen and shop- 
keepers, to minister to the wants and luxuries of the genteeler 
classes in the parish. With the finest harbour in the west of Scot- 
land in front of it, and abundance of coals on the opposite coast, 
Lamlash ought to be, not a paltry village, but a flourishing town, 
the seat of manufactures and the centre of commerce. In fact, it is 
a more arduous undertaking to hinder than promote its growth 
and prosperity. For now that the rail-road from Glasgow to Ayr- 
shire is on the point of being completed, the power of steam will 
bring it so near Glasgow and Paisley, that its inhabitants can very 
easily draw towards themselves a few currents from that broad 
stream of wealth and industry, by which these mighty and inex- 
haustible reservoirs are at present feeding and enriching so many 
populous villages and second-rate towns of the mainland.

PRESBYTERY OF KINTYRE, SYNOD OF ARGYLL. 

THE REV. ANGUS MACMILLAN, MINISTER. 

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

iVame.— Kilmorie, the name of the parish, is derived from Kill- 
mhiure, i. e. St Mary's. Its most southern extremity is in lati- 
tude 55° 29' 30", and in longitude 4° 17'. It extends from 
Largybeg Point on the south, to Lochranza water on the north, a di- 
rect distance of about twenty-four miles. The ruggedness of the in- 
terior renders travelling through it impracticable, and the consequent 
circuitousness of the road, which winds along the shore, increases 
the actual distance between the extremities of the parish to near- 
ly thirty miles. Its average breadth is 6 miles, and its area about 
60,000 Scots acres. Its figure is semi-elliptical ; the greater axis 
extending from the southern to the northern extremities, in a 
straight line, passing through the centre of the island, and divid- 
ing this parish, through its whole length, from Kilbride parish 
the circumference running along the shore, bounded, on the south, 
from Largybeg Point to the Brown Head, by the Frith of Clyde, 
separating it from that part of Ayrshire called Carrick, from which 
it is about sixteen miles distant ; and on the east, from the Brown 
Head to Lochranza, by the Sound of Kilbrandon, separating it from 
Kintyre, from which it is on an average six miles distant. 

The arable land is chiefly confined to the vicinity of the sea 
coast. On the south, it lies on an elevated terrace about half-a- 
mile broad, having a precipitous sea bank in front, and heath-clad 
hills in the back ground. On the east, the vale of Shisken, the 
most fertile and best cultivated part of the island, runs a considera- 
ble distance into the interior, and contains above 1700 Scots acres 
of arable land. From this to Lochranza, the soil is in general 
sterile, and the ground steep and uneven. In the sea bank, which

we have mentioned, and which is also found at Shisken, there 
are numerous caves and fissures, some of them very spacious and 
romantic. These will be more particularly described under an- 
other division of this account. The extent of coast is about 30 
miles, and is in general bold and rocky, especially at Dippen, 
Struey, Brown Head, and Drumidoon. The principal bays are 
those of Kilpatrick, Machry, and Lochranza ; but it is only in the 
last that there is eithei' shelter or anchorage. The principal 
headlands are Dippen, a land-mark well-known to all who navi- 
gate the Clyde, and the Brown Head. Off this, and about a mile 
from the shore, lies the Iron Isle, a sunken rock of considerable 
length, but only visible at low water. About the same distance from 
land, and opposite Kildonan, lies the low and green island of Pladda, 
on which a lighthouse 40 feet high was built about the year 1800. 
A new, higher, and more elegant one was built in the year 1826. 
The former one was allowed to remain, and thus, by showing two 
lights, the one above the other, Pladda light is distinguished from 
Cumbrae, which lies about twenty-two miles farther up the Frith. 
These lights are stationary, and erected upon separate towers, 
the one above the other. They appear like two stars of the first 
magnitude at the distance of four or five leagues, or at lesser 
distances, according to the state of the atmosphere. When seen 
in one line, they bear from each other, north and south. 

The temperature of this parish, and other parts of the west coast 
surrounded by the sea, is understood not to be so warm in summer, 
nor so cold in winter, as that of other places in the same parallel, 
and of the same elevation, on the east coast, nor does the medium tem- 
perature vary so much here, as it does in the broadest parts of Bri- 
tain, toward the south of England, where it is most distant from 
the sea. Still less does it vary so much as it does in the same pa- 
rallel on the opposite continents of Europe and America. The 
air is keen and bracing ; the climate dry and salubrious, for though 
the height of the mountains attract the clouds, and cause more 
rain to fall here than in parts which are less hilly, yet the nume- 
rous rivulets which run down their sides, and flow through the glens, 
soon carries it away, and thus the country is free from all those va- 
pours which arise from stagnant waters, and from all febrile dis- 
eases which prevail in low and humid countries. 

Thunder-storms are by no means of unfrequent occurrence in 
summer. It is impossible to convey to one who has not witnessed a 
thunder-storm among the mountains, any adequate idea of the terrific

grandeur and awful solemnity of such a scene. Snow-storms also 
occasionally happen ; but, coming as they do from the north-east 
and east, and having, consequently, to cross a great extent of 
mountains before they reach this island, they are, in a great mea- 
sure, spent before they arrive. Sometimes, however, the ground is 
covered with snow to a considerable depth ; but though in the deep 
recesses and ravines of the granite mountains it lies deep, and long, 
yet it seldom lies longer than a few days in the low grounds, and 
on the sea-shore it is speedily dissolved.

The streams, or rivulets, owing to the mountainous character of 
the island, are numerous ; many of them of considerable size and 
rapidity, and all affording good sport to the angler. Some of them, 
in their course, form cascades of great height and beauty. Tho.se 
most deserving of notice are the cascades of Essmore, on Auchin- 
hew water, and Esscumhan, on Leven water. The former occa- 
sionally presents a phenomenon of singular and beautiful appear- 
ance — an iris, perfectly circular in form. 

There are many fresh-waler lakes interspersed through the hills 
of the interior. Those of most note are Loch lorsa, about a mile 
in length, but very narrow, and Loch Tanna, about two miles in 



KILMORIE. 



43 



length, likewise very narrow for its length ; the former celebrated 
for its salmon, the latter for its trout. 

Lochranza is the only salt water loch in the parish. It is about 
a mile in length. Near its head, and on the south side, a small 
low peninsula projects into the loch, and forms within, a commodi- 
ous basin nf great depth and security. On the peninsula stands 
the ancient castle of Lochranza, once a royal hunting residence, 
but now roofless, and fast falling to ruin. During the season of 
herring- fishing, Lochranza is a place of great resort. Two or 
three hundred boats may often be seen lying at anchor, drying 
their nets in the bay ; and seldom will a lovelier sight be seen 
than when, in the summer evening, they move simultaneously out 
of the loch, separating as they advance, to shoot their nets on the 
fishing-ground. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — Arran has been much resorted to 
by geologists and mineralogists. Within the limited compass 
of this account, we can do nothing more than give a brief sketch 
of this part of the subject, and in doing so, we shall endeavour to 
connect, as much as possible, the local with the scientific arrange- 
ment. For this purpose, we shall commence at the north end of 
the parish. There the hills are all composed of the primary for- 
mation, which extends from Lochranza to lorsa. ' To the south of 

IS 

lorsa, the country is more level, and the strata entirely of the se- 
condary formation. 

Granite. — Benvarian and Glencatacol. — The granite in the pa- 
rish is of a much finer grain than that in Goatfell and the adja- 
cent hills. 

Mica Slate. — Mica and chlorite slate extend along the shore 
from Lochranza to lorsa, and form the hills in that district, until 
they come in contact with granite. 

Clay Slate. — Argillaceous and clay-slate appear but in one 
small detached spot on the south-west of Lochranza. It is very 
abundant in the neighbouring parish. 

Conglomerate comes next in order, and may be seen to great 
advantage along the shore, from lorsa to King's Cove, and also on 
the secondary hills above Shisken. The ingredients that enter 
into its composition are fragments of clay-slate, mica-slate, gray- 
wacke-slate, quartz, a little jasper, and sandstone. These are ge- 
nerally rounded, as if worn by attrition, and are evidently the re- 
mains of former rocks, which are here consolidated. 

Red sandstone is found lying below the conglomerate, but often- 



44 



BUTES[IRR. 



er above it. This rock is found in great abundance from Machry 
to Drumidoon, and also at the eastern extremity of the parish. The 
beds are usually of great thickness, and very much inclined as they 
approach the primary sandstone. 

White sandstone, a variety considered by some as distinct from 
the former, lines the coast on the east side of the parish. It con- 
sists of numerous beds a few feet in thickness, separated by thin 
layers of shiver. The thickness of all this series of beds combin- 
ed cannot be less than 1000 feet. This species of rock is very 
extensively distributed, extending along the shore from Shisken to 
Dippen, a distance along the coast of twelve miles, and throughout 
its whole course is visible, save when covered with overlying rocks, 
such as porphyry, or trap, or when intersected by veins of basalt. 
It is not confined to the sea shore, but extends backward into the 
interior beneath the secondary hills, to the other side of the is- 
land, as may be seen where the water courses have worn away the 
overlying soil or rock. The dip of the strata is to the south, and 
varies from an angle of 20° to 48°. 

Trap JRock. — The varieties of this class of rocks extend over the 
secondary sandstone, and are so numerous, and pass into each 
other in such a manner, that it would be more than useless to at- 
tempt a description of all that mineralogists have enumerated, and 
which are to be found in this parish. 

Greenstone abounds most about Dippen rocks. 

Dikes of basalt and greenstone intersect the whole southern 
shore. 

The variety of trap called clinkstone abounds in Pladda, and in 
the hills of the adjacent part of the island. 

Porphyries. — All the above varieties of trap rocks have their 
porphyries near the same locality. The variety most worthy of 
notice is that called clinkstone porphyry, which is of a grey co- 
lour, and found on the farm of Drumidoon, and the hill to the 
south of it called the Brownhead. 

Pitchstone porphyry is a striking feature in the mineralogy of 
Arran. It is found in great abundance in the vicinity of King's 
Cove, and Tormore, in veins of great thickness. It sometimes 
seems to approximate in character to what is by some called horn- 
fXone. 

Limestone is found in two or three places in the parish. The 
beds about Shisken, especially at Glenloig, and Clachan glen, 
are well worth working. In these the lime approaches to almost 



I 



KILMORIE. 



45 



perfect purity. No traces of shells, or of any other fossil remains 
are to be found in it. Hence, it is believed to be of older forma- 
tion than that found at Corrie, and other parts of the island. 

Independent minerals. — In granite, rock-crystals, talc, epidote, 
stilbite.— trap rock, prehnite, mesotype, chalcedony. 

Names of the rocks and simple minerals in the parish : Granite. 
No gneiss is any where found in it, mica slate, chlorite slate, 
clay slate, conglomerate, breccia or puddingstone, red sandstone, 
white sandstone, clinkstone, greenstone, basalt, basaltic-porphyry, 
greenstone porphyry, clinkstone-porphyry, pitchstone, pitchstone- 
porphyry. 

Simple Minerals. — Rock-crystal, talc, epidote, stilbite, prehnite, 
mesotype, chalcedony in pitchstone veins. 

All varieties of soil are to be found in the parish. Near the 
shore it is sandy or gravelly ; beyond this, it is generally clayey ; 
and in the vicinity of the hills, which are nowhere above a mile 
and a-half from the sea, it is mossy. The straths alon the river 
sides are rich loam. 

The only mines wrought in the parish, are the limestone quar- 
ries of Clachan and Glenloig, and these but to a limited extent, 
owing partly to their difficulty of access, partly to their distance 
from the arable land, but chiefly to the want of fuel to burn the 
stone. 

Botany. — Arran is a field that has hitherto been but little cul- 
tivated by the botanist. It is seldom that he has penetrated its 
wild and sequestered glens, or climbed its alpine heights; but 
when at any time he has done so, he has been amply repaid for 
his toil ; and I doubt not, when it is fully explored, it will be found 
as rich in plants as in minerals. We subjoin a list of the rarer 
plants of the parish, with their localities.

The four last were not known to exist in the island till a few 
years ago, when they were discovered by a young gentleman be- 
longing to the parish. They are extremely rare, so much so, that 
the only other places where they are known to exist in Britain, are 
the Mull of Galloway, and the Head of Houth in Ireland. The 
Lathyrus sylvestris is very seldom found in a wild stiite in Scot- 
land. 

The forests which covered the island so late as the time of Dean 
Donald Munro, who published his tour through the Hebrides in 
the year 1567, have almost entirely disappeared ; and no attempt 
has as yet been made to replace them. The only spot of the pa- 
rish that has been planted is a large tumulus on the farm of She- 
dog. The trees are very healthy, and considering the small body 
th ere is of them, and the exposed situation in which thev stand, 
th rive remarkably well. Were parts of the hill-sides covered with 
plantations, and clumps of trees interspersed through the low- 
lands, especially along the banks of the rivers and streamlets, it 
would relieve the country of the bleak and naked aspect that it now 
presents, and increase both the beauty and the value of the property. 

Zoology. — The destruction of the forests has proved fatal to all 
animals of prey, if such at any time existed in the island, and 
threatens to prove equally so to those of the chase. Foxes, 
badgers, polecats, weasels, &amp;c. which are common in the adjacent 
counties of Ayr and Argyle, are here unknown. The red-deer, 
said to have been once very abundant in the parish, are now only, 
and but rarely, to be met with in the wild and solitary heights of 
Glenespig, Gleniorsa, and Glenfas. Hares are pretty numerous; 
and rabbits abound among the downs on the sea-shore, and the 
rocky heights of the interior. 

The native breed of horses, cattle, and sheep, has entirely dis- 
appeared within the last twenty years, and a new and much improved 
one been introduced in its stead. This change has been effected 
partly by importation, and partly by crossing, but chiefly by the 
latter mode. 

The native breed of horses, supposed to have in it a dash of 
Spanish blood, was diminutive, but remarkably sure-footed, hardy, 
and tractable. That at present used, approximates nearer in size 
and symmetry to the Ayrshire breed ; which being heavier is bet- 
ter adapted for the purposes of agriculture. 

The native breed of sheep was small, wliite-fiiced, and horn- 
less ; seldom weighing more than a stone, or a stone and a half ; 



KILMORIE.

and supposed to be of Norwegian origin. This lias been supplant- 
ed by the black-faced ; and it again, in one instance, but to a con- 
siderable extent, has been crossed with the Cheviot. It was feared 
that these would not be sufficiently hardy for the climate, but so 
far as the experiment has gone, they have not in any degree de- 
teriorated, but have fully realized the expectation of the farmer. 

The native breed of cattle, seems to have been a mongrel of 
Galloway, Ayr, and Argyleshire, with httle attention either 
to size or symmetry ; they were consequently reckoned in the 
market of an inferior description. Very cqjisiderable attention 
has been paid to their improvement since 1810, in the first instance 
by the proprietor, who introduced bulls of a superior breed from 
Argyleshire, giving the free use of them to the tenantry. Since 
that period the tenantry themselves have taken an interest in the 
matter, and the improvement has been most marked and rapid. 
Should the same system be persevered in for a few years longer, 
Arran will not be behind any part of the Highlands in its breed 
of black-cattle. 

Goats are now kept only on one farm, and here they have long 
since ceased to milk them. 

The roe, the wild boar, and capercailzie, are said to have been 
at one time very abundant in the parish ; and the fact of its being 
part of the Royal hunting domain, gives credibility to the tradition ; 
but they have been long since extinct. Black-game and grouse 
swarm in the most unbounded profusion. The ptarmigan is 
found on the tops of the granite mountains, and partridges are 
sometimes met with on the low-lands of the Southend. Plovers 
and starlings are common. Eagles, kites, hawks of various kinds,, 
owls, and carrion-crows, were so at one time likewise ; but since 
the proprietor has given a premium for their destruction, they 
have nearly been extirpated. The smaller birds, such as spar- 
rows, bullfinches, &amp;c. have become vastly more numerous since 
these enemies of their kind have been destroyed. 

Several species of snakes are found in the woods, glens, and 
moorlands adjoining the arable ground ; but seldom if ever in the 
heights of the interior. The largest of them is between three 
and four feet long. 

Trout and salmon are found in all the rivers, trout in all the 
lakes, and salmon in Loch lorsa. Neither are by any means so 
abundant as they were forty years ago. The decrease is partly ow- 
ing to the want of protection in close-time, and partly to the use

of lime in agriculture, llie salmon enters the rivers in July, and 
returns in October. No fishings are let. 

Seals and otters are found along the shore. The sea around 
the whole parish is well stocked with fish of all descriptions. 
Haddock, whiting, mackerel, seath, and cod abound. Ling and 
turbotare caught off the Southend ; but the fishermen engaged in 
taking them are almost all from the Ayr coast. Lobster and 
crab fishing is carried on by the natives about Kildonan, for the 
Glasgow market. At the Northetid, the herring-fishery is carried 
on with great spiritskill, and success by the inhabitants, who in 
a great measure depend upon it for their subsistence.

n. — Civil History. 
There are few events of historical interest connected with this 
parish, except such as are common to the other islands of the He- 
brides, till the time of King Robert Bruce. After his disastrous 
defeat at Methven, and his perilous escape at Dairy, he retired 
with a few of his most influential and intrepid adherents to the 
small island of Rathrin, on the north coast of Ireland. There, under 
the protection of the Lord of the Isles, he spent the winter of 1307, 
sighing, as he viewed the dark and distant hills of his beloved 
country, 

" O Scotland, shall it ere be mine, 

To wreak thy wrongs in battle line, 

To raise my victor hands, and see, 

Thy hills, thy vales — thy people free  

That glance of bliss is all I crave. 

Betwixt my labours, and the grave." — Lord of the Isles. 

On the return of spring, he crossed over to Arran, whither he 
bad been preceded by Lord James Douglas and Sir Robert Boyd, 
who, on his landing, 

" Met him like friends who part in pain. 
And meet in doubtful hope again." Ibid. 

Amid the forests and fastnesses of Arran, he could live conceal- 
ed from his enemies, who lay on the opposite coast of Carrick, 
while his proximity to its shores enabled him to obtain the ear- 
liest and most accurate intelligence of their situation and their

strength ; to fan the embers of Hberty that still lived in the 
bosoms of his countrymen, and be at hand to take advantage of 
any false movement on the part of his foes, or any favourable one 
on that of his friends. During his stay on the island, he made a 
cave, on the sequestered shore of Drumidoon, the place of his 
usual residence. How long he remained here is uncertain, but it 
was sufficiently long to attach the inhabitants unalienably to his 
interests. A body. of their number fought under his banner at 
Bannockburn, and for services then rendered, or kindnesses for- 
merly shewn, after his accession to the throne of his ancestors, he 
gave many of them grants of land on the island, one of which is 
held by the lineal descendant to this day. 

The circumstances of his departure are somewhat differently 
related. Tradition, which always affects the romaHtic, narrates, 
that one morning, while musing in bed over his past misfortune, 
and his future prospects, he observed a spider vigorously endeavour- 
ing to raise itself to the roof of the barn in which he lay. Once 
and again it failed in its attempts, just as many times as he had 
done in his, to regain the throne of his ancestors. Though often 
baffled, yet it still persevered, and ultimately succeeded. Ani- 
mated by this prophetic incident, alone, and disguised as a min- 
strel, he crossed over to his maternal castle of Turnberry, in Car- 
rick, then garrisoned by the English under Percy. Should he 
find matters favourable to his cause, he was to make a signal to 
his friends whom he left behind, by lighting a fire on an eminence 
above the castle, on seeing which they were to follow him. In- 
stead, however, of finding them favourable, he found them quite 
the reverse. The garrison was strong and vigilant ; his partisans, 
few, feeble, and dispirited ; and even his own hereditary vassals 
indifferent, if not hostile. 

" Long harassed by oppressor's band, 

Courage and faith had fled the land, 

And over Carrick, dark and deep, 

Had sunk dejection's iron sleep. — Lord of the Tsles. 

The minstrel monarch was therefore on the eve of returning, when 
Providence achieved for him what his own prudence would not 
have permitted him to attempt. A fire was raised for some other 
purpose on the very spot where the preconcerted signal was to 
have been lighted. Aware of the consequence, Bruce spent the 
night on the beach, that he might apprise his friends of the mis- 
take, before their arrival could be discovered by the enemy. They 
reached the shore before dawn, but, when told of the circumstance,

and though assured that any attempt to surprise or carry tlic 
castle, or to raise the country, was desperate, and though dissuad- 
ed, it is said, by their royal leader, and urged to return in silence 
to their former retreat, they resolutely refused to quit the land of 
their fathers, till they had either freed it, or fallen in its rescue. 

" Answered fierce Edward, ' Hap what may, 
In Carrick, Carrick's lord shall stay; 
I would not minstrel told the tale, 
Wildfire or meteor made us quail, 
I will not credit that this land, 
So famed for warlike heart and hand, 
The nurse of Wallace, and of Bruce, 
Will long with tyrants hold a truce,' 
' Prove we our fate, the hrunt will bide,' 
So Boyd — so Haye — so Lennox cried. 
So said — so vowed the leaders all. 
So Bruce resolved — ' And in my hall. 
Since the bold Southern make their home, 
■ The hour of judgment soon shall come, 
When with a rough, and rugged host, 
Clifford may reckon to his cost.' " — Ibid. 

The manner of Bruce's departure, as related by the accurate Lord 
Hailes, in his Annals of Scotland, is circumstantially the same 
with that handed down by tradition, with the single exception of 
the task of exploring the country, being committed to a confiden- 
tial messenger, instead of being undertaken by the King in per- 
son. 

The sequel of the story, which forms one of the brightest pages 
in the annals of Scotlafid, belongs not to this part of the work. 

At a subsequent, but more recent period, Arran supplied an 
asylum to another, who like Bruce, was outlawed for his rebel- 
lious adherence to the Royal cause of Scotland. After the dis- 
comfiture of the rising of 1745, the Honourable Charles Boyd, 
son of the unfortunate Lord Kilmarnock, who expiated the part 
he took in it, on the Tower Hill of London, fled to this parish, 
•where he lay concealed in the farm of Aucheliffin, till he found an 
opportunity of escaping to France. While living in this gloomy 
and sequestered glen, he happened to fall on a chest of medical 
books, and amused himself by the study of that science, which he 
afterwards turned to benevolent account. After a residence of 
twenty years inFrance, he returned to his native country, and fixed 
his residence at Aberdeen. This is the person whom Boswell 
mentions as having received himself and Dr Johnson, when on 
their tour to the Hebrides, at Slanes Castle, in absence of his bro- 
ther the Earl of Errol.

antler III., who wrested it from the Danes, by the defeat of Haco, 
continued in the crown till the reign of James III. The greater 
part of it seems to have been kept as a hunting domain for the 
Kinofs of Scotland, whose residence was the Castle of Lochranza. 
In 1334, Arran is mentioned by Boethius as the property of Ro- 
bert, the great Steward of Scotland, afterwards Robert II. When 
ravaged by Donald, Earl of Rothes, and the Lord of the Isles, in 
1456, it was the possession of James II. — James III. on the mar- 
riage of the Princess Margaret to Sir Thomas, son of Lord Boyd, 
erected Arran into an earldom, and gave it as a dowry to his 
sister. After her discreditable divorce from Sir Thomas, she was 
married a second time to Sir James Hamilton, and the same por- 
tion given her as on her first marriage. Arran thus became, in 
1474, the property of the family of Hamilton, in which it has con- 
tinued till the present day. The unentailed part of it, extending 
from lorsa to Lochranza, was bequeathed by the late Duke Dou- 
glas to his only daughter, the Honourable Mrs Westenra, to whom 
it now belongs. The only other proprietor in the parish is John 
Fullerton, Esq. of Kilmichael, who holds the property of White- 
farlan, by the grant of King Robert. 

Eminent Characters. — The Rev. William Shaw, author of the 
first Gaelic Grammar and Dictionary that were published, was 
born at Clachaig in this parish. In this arduous and patriotic 
undertaking, he was honoured with the patronage and advice of 
the then Earl of Eglinton, and the celebrated Dr Samuel John- 
son. As it claims to be the birth-place of the first Celtic scholar, 
so also it claims to be the death-place of the first Celtic bard. 
Ossian is said to have died here. 

Antiquities and Natural Curiosities. — There are a few Danish 
forts, Druidical circles, obelisks of unhewn stone, and tumuli of 
considerable magnitude, scattered through the parish. 

By far the largest and most important of these fortifications is 
the Doon, on the farm of Drumidoon. The sea-cliffs in front 
form a defence 300 feet perpendicular. On the land side, the as- 
cent is steep, and round the summit, on the edge of this inclined 
plane, there is a wall, extending from the cliffs on the one side, to 
the cliffs on the other side, enclosing a level area of several acres, 
containing what appears to be the ruins of rude habitations. The 
wall, which was dry built, is now fallen, and a great quantity of 
the stone carried away for drains, dikes, &amp;c. ; but still the ruins are 
very extensive, and the gateway distinctly discernible.

There is another, but much smaller one, called Tor-a-chaistell, 
on the farm of Sliddery. Though generally regarded as a Danish 
fort, its size, situation, appearance, and name, seem rather to in- 
dicate that it was a castle or circular building, roofed in either for 
refuge or defence. Druidical circles are found on many of the 
moors, and the moss which generally surrounds them proves the 
places to have been at one time covered with wood. The most per- 
fect and interesting of these is that on " Sliabh-nan-carachan," on 
the farm of Tormore. It is called " Siudhe choir Fhionn," or 
Fingal's cauldron seat. All structures or monuments of mao-nitude 
are invariably ascribed by the Highlanders to the gigantic race of 
Fingal, whose stature and strength, if estimated by their works, 
completely cast the sons of Anak into the shade. On this circu- 
lar row of stones, the cauldron of Fingal is said to have been sup- 
ported, and if its depth bore any proportion to its diameter, it might 
have served for a boiler to the largest steamer that has yet crossed 
the Atlantic. In one of the stones that form the circle, there is 
a perforation, evidently artificital, and well worn on the edges, to 
which Fingal tied his favourite dog Bran. 

Immediately adjoining this circle, stand three upright columns 
of rough unhewn stones, about 15 feet in height and 11 in cir- 
cumference. A fourth has long since fallen, or been broken down 
by the surface, and attempted to be made into mill stones; but 
they seem to have been spoiled in the making, for they still re- 
main on the spot. As one-third, at least, of their entire length 
must be under ground, that cannot be less than 20 feet. They 
consist of primitive red sandstone, and millstone grit — a species of 
rock that is not to be found in situ near the spot. They must, 
therefore, have been carried from a considerable distance, up a 
long but gentle ascent, to their present position. The conveyance 
of such immense blocks, from such a distance, and by such a way, 
would require more skill in mechanics than is possessed by the pre- 
sent inhabitants of the parish. Tradition, therefore, ascribes their 
erection to Fingal, and his followers, though by some it is consi- 
dered as more probably due to the Scandinavians, who long pos- 
sessed the islands of the Hebrides, and whose native country is 
thickly set with such massive monuments. In the moss around the 
eminence on which these obelisks stand, large trunks of oak trees 
are found imbedded, which show that the place was formerly a 
forest, and which has been held as jiroof that this was a fane of 
Druidical devotion. We know that the Druids performed their 



KILMORIE. 



53 



religious worship in groves, and that columns and circles similar to 
those that here exist mark the place of its celebration. Stone- 
hegne, and all similar remains of antiquity, will ever be attributed 
to the Druids, — yet they are found in countries such as Scandi- 
navia and Scotland, where we have no evidence to show that they 
ever existed. We have no information of them, except what is fur- 
nished us by the Roman writers, who state, that their principal 
seats were in Gaul and Britain, and that they worshipped exclu- 
sively in groves. The monuments of antiquity called Druidical 
were clearly erected for public purposes, whether legislative, 
judicial, festal, sepulchral, or sacred, and consequently vary much 
in form and dimensions. A copious account of those found in 
Sweden has been published by M. Seoberg, the most distinguish- 
ed antiquary of that country, but unfortunately in his own native 
language. One of these described by him is remarkable, as the 
stones of which it is composed are arranged in the shape of a ship; 
some of the rows representing the position of the masts, others 
the yards, &amp;c. evidently indicating the burial place of a distinguish- 
ed naval officer. The probability of these remains in Scotland 
being of Scandinavian origin, is heightened by the fact of their 
being chiefly found on the coasts and islands that were most fre- 
quented by the Norsemen. 

Similar obelisks are found in different other parts of the parish, 
but they are evidently monumental, such are those at Maregrioch, 
Auchincar, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the former place, there are two columns 
about 30 feet distant. Between them there is a parallel row of 
smaller stones, forming a parallelogram about 4 feet wide. At a 
little distance, a smaller area is enclosed in a similar manner. The 
larger is said to be the grave of one of Fingal's heroes ; the smaller 
that of his dog. Both were opened some time since, but found to 
contain nothing but dust and stones. Instead of the side stones 
forming the parallelogram being replaced in their former situation, 
as interesting monuments of antiquity, all that could be removed 
were carried away for building. 

There are also many cairns or tumuli in the parish. The 
largest in Scotland is said to be that at Blackwater Foot. It is 
now much diminished in size, owing to the g''eat quantity of stones 
that has been carried away from it for dikes, drains, houses, &amp;c. 
but when entire, it was said to measure across upwards of 200 
feet. To the north of it, and not far from Sliabh nan carachan, 
is another, said to mark the spot where Fingal held his court of

justice. The stone on which the culprit stood is still pointed out, 
and called the Panel's stone. In the neighbourhood is the farm where 
he celebrated his feast of shells. His daughter's grave is shown on 
the farm of Drumidoon. It is an immense unhewn trough or flag- 
stone, resting horizontally upon vertical stones at each end, deeply 
fixed on the ground. On being opened, there was only found in it 
an urn containing ashes. The urn was broken in the opening, and 
the fragments carried off by those engaged in the operation. 
The place was evidently one of sepulture, for around it are a 
number of vertical stones, which, by their arrangement, clearly in- 
dicate their object. About the middle of Glen-in-tshuidhe, and 
by the side of the old road, a cairn, now moss-covered, called 
suidhe Challum Chille, marks the spot where St Columba sat down 
to refresh himself with his disciple, when travelling through the 
island, evangelizing its heathen inhabitants. Another cairn, called 
Aran, or Ar Fhinn, on the shore of Catacol, marked the spot 
where Fingal defeated the Norsemen under Manus, son of the 
King of Sweden, whence some say the island took its name. The 
present road has been cut through it, and its materials used for its 
formation, so that now not a vestige remains to mark its site. 

Religious Houses. — The ruins of the Convent of St Bride, ce- 
lebrated by Sir Walter Scott, in his Lord of the Isles, as the lone- 
ly residence of the Lady Isabella, were but recently to be seen at 
Lochranza. The very foundation has lately been razed and re- 
moved, and not a stone now marks the cloisters, where dwelt the 
Maid of Lorn. The ruins of an oratory or cell belonging to a 
monk called John, and containing the remains of the saint, stand 
on the farm of Balnacula. Near it, and in the middle of the 
burying ground at Clachan, is the grave of St Molios, " the bare- 
headed servant of Jesus." His first residence was in the Isle of 
Lamlash, or the Isle of Molios ; but he afterwards removed to 
Shisken, and fixed his residence where now repose his remains. He 
died here at the advanced age of 120. On the stone which covers 
his grave, and which is said to have been brought from lona, the 
figure of the saint, arrayed in the robes of a mitred abbot, with 
chalice and crosier in his hands, is not inelegantly sculptured. Till 
within the last fifty years, it was customary for females after their 
confinement, to repair to the grave of the saint, and there deposit 
upon the stone a silver piece, as a thank-offering for their reco- 
very. The ruins of another chapel arc to be seen on the farm of 
Binnicarragan. This seems to have been in fornier times the 



KILMOIUE.

■place of worship for the district, and around it that fot interment, 
till the removal of the former to Kilmorie. Infants are still bu- 
ried in it, and the wall that enclosed it nay still be traced by its 
ruins, but the only monument of them which lie beneath, is a stone, 
beautifully carved. A well, once celebrated for its miraculous sa- 
natory virtues, stands at a short distance from the chapel. 

Castles.— Lochrmza. Castle, now roofless, and fast falling in 
ruins, stands upon a small green peninsula, near the entrance of 
the loch. The date of its erection is uncertain, but it is enume- 
rated in 1380 among the royal castles, as a hunting-seat of the 
Scottish sovereigns. It was afterwards inhabited by the Montgo- 
meries of Skilraorlie, the ancestors of the family of Eglinton, who 
possessed a considerable part of the north end of the parish, but 
lost it in wadset to the family of Hamilton. Kildonan Castle is 
a square tower, standing on the edge of a precipitous sea-cliff, op- 
posite to Pladda. It scarcely deserves the name of a castle, and 
seems rather to have formed one of a line of watch-towers, extend- 
ing from the entrance of the Clyde to the Rock of Dumbarton. It 
was originally the residence of a family of the name of Macdonald, 
to whom the adjoining lands belonged. From these, it passed to 
the Stewarts of Kilquhully, in Bute, who sold it, with the rest of 
their properties, to the Marquis of Bute, from whom it was lately 
purchased by the Duke of Hamilton. 

Natural Curiosities. — The natural curiosities are numerous, but 
those most deserving of notice are the caves and cascades. Of the 
former there are many, but the largest and most romantic are 
the Monster's Cave, at Strueyrock, which is 110 feet long, 40 feet 
broad, and 80 high ; the Preaching Cave at Kilpatrick, and 
Kino-'s Cave at Drumidoon, the retreat and residence of King Ro 
bert'Bruce. It is 114 feet long, 44 broad, and 47 high. On 
the side-wall, and near the entrance, wer&amp; inscribed the letters, 
M. D. R. These are now almost, if not altogether, deleted by th 
action of the weather, and the scribbling of visitants. But at its 
southern extremity may still be seen, rudely cut, a hunting scene, 
said to have been done by the fugitive monarch, as figurative of 
his own condition, when he made this lonely cavern the place of 
his abode. Several other representations are said to have covered 
its walls, executed by the same hand ; but they have all been 
cither entirely erazed, or rendered untraceable by those of more re- 
cent writers. It has lately been cleared of its accumulated filth 
and rubbish, and a wall built around its entrance, to prevent the 
still remaining memorials of persecuted royalty from being injured.

0r effaced by the wantonness of strangers. There are a number of 
other caves beside it, some of them of equal magnitude, though 
of less interest. One of them is called the King's Kitchen ; ano- 
ther his cellar; a third his stable, &amp;c. The cascades we have 
noticed elsewhere.

Parochial Registers.— There are separate registers for .session, 
baptisms, and marriages, kept at Kilmorie, Shisken, and Loch- 
ranza. Those of Kilmorie are the earliest, the fullest, and the 
most accurate. The others are kept for the convenience of the 
inhabitants, at places, where, from the great extent of the parish, 
and the distance of the parish church, places of worship have been 
erected, and the ordinances are administered, either by the clergy- 
man or his assistant. Those of Kilmorie commence in May 1701, 
and are regularly, fully, and beautifully kept till May 1729. From 
this date till 1762, they are lost, with the exception of the scroll 
minutes of a few meetings of session in 1736-7, on loose leaves 
stitched together, but almost illegible. From 1762 till the pre- 
sent date, they are regularly and carefully, though not very taste- 
fully kept. The two first volumes, which are by far the most in- 
teresting, are quite loose in the binding ; the edges much worn in, 
and a good deal of the writing gone. The words that are lost could 
still be supplied from the context, but, unless they are speedily 
transcribed, from the decaying state of the paper, they will soon 
be entirely destroyed. 

A grain-mill at Shedog, a distillery at Lag, and a hnt and wool- 
mill at Burican, are the only public works in the parish. 

HL — Population. 
We have no accessible means of ascertaining the state of the 
population prior to 1791, though doubtless the rent-rolls would 
furnish data for a pretty accurate approximation, as far back as 
they extend. 

In 1791, it amounted to 2830 
1801, . 2996 

1811, . 2420 

1821, . 3827

The decrease of population in the last ten years was owing to 
the introduction of a new system of agriculture, by which the ham- 
let or runrig system of cultivation, which universally prevailed 
through the parish prior to 1815, was entirely abolished on the 
property of the Duke of Hamilton. Separate lots of land were 
then given to each tenant ; and many farms which were formerly 
leased by eight or fifteen families, with as many cottars, were given 
to one individual. In one instance, as many as four hamlets, each 
containing a number of families, were depopulated, and converted 
into a sheep-walk. Some of the ejected inhabitants emigrated to 
North America, but by far the greater part of them removed to 
the towns of Ayrshire. 

The population is entirely rural. There is not one village in. 
the parish. 

The annual number of births during the seven years, from 1825 
to 1831 inclusive, is 97; and the annual average number of mar- 
riages during the same period, is 19. There is no register of 
deaths kept.

Character of the People. — In their persons, the people are ge- 
nerally tall ; at least they are above the middle size, athletic and 
very well made. Their features are open and regular, and their 
limbs remarkably well-formed. The women are decidedly taller, 
handsomer, and better-looking than in most parts of the country.. 
These remarks apply generally to the whole parish, but they more 
particularly hold with regard to the south end of it. In their man- 
ners they are courteous and affable, having little of the awkward 
embarrassment which the Highland peasantry generally manifest 
in addressing strangers and superiors. In mind, they are distin- 
guished for their sound sense, intelligence, acuteness, and liveli- 
ness. In business, they are active, enterprising, and judicious. 
Like all islanders, they are generally inclined to a seafaring life, 
and their proximity to the ports of Greenock and Ardrossan, af- 
ford them ample opportunity to indulge their maritime propensi- 
ties. Being generally steady, honest, and good seamen, such of 
them as have a nautical education, are soon promoted to the com-

mand of vessels, and many of them latterly become themselves 
owners. 

In few parishes is there a greater respect paid to religion, or a 
more regular and devoted observance of its ordinances. A com- 
petent and correct knowledge of the peculiar and fundamental 
doctrines of the gospel is very generally possessed, and among 
them are to be found not a few spiritually-minded, lively, and in- 
telligent Christians, adorning the gospel they profess, by a walk 
and conversation conformed to its precepts. After the revival 
which took place in the parish under the ministry of the late Rev. 
Neil Macbride, in 1812, there was scarcely a family in which the 
worship of God was not maintained morning and evening, but, wc 
regret to say, that now it is by no means so common. 

Many of the games, profane customs, and superstitions pecu- 
liar to the Highlands, formerly prevailed in the parish, but these, 
together with the vices of drinking, swearing, &amp;c. in a great mea- 
sure perished in the revival. We regret to say, that, among the 
rising generation, who give little promise of walking in the foot- 
steps of their fathers, the latter seem to be again reviving. Both 

• The following extract from the session-records of Kilmorie will illustrate one 
of the superstitious customs of the Highlands. It was by no means peculiar to this 
island : 

" Session at Clachan, September 4, 1 709. — Janet Hunter being formally summon- 
ed, and called, compeared, and being questioned anent the report that was given forth 
on her, that she used a charm for the Oiscovery of theft, by turning the riddle, she 
plainly confessed that she did use it ; and being farther interrogate what words she 
used, she replied that she used no words ; and being asked if she did not say,  by 
Peter, by Paul, it was such a person,' she replied that she did use these words, and 
none else ; and being fartlier interrogate, if the riddle did turn at the naming of any 
of those persons suspected, she replied that it did actually turn at the naming of one ; 
and being interrogate farther, who employed her, she replied it was Barbara M' Marchie, 
in the same town, who employed her j and she being farther interrogate, if she had 
any other body with her at the said exorcite, she replied that there was one Florence 
M'Donald, servitrix to Hector M'Alister here, who was holding the side of the 
shears with her. It being farther interrogate, if she thought there was any fault or 
sin in it, she replied that she thought there was none in it, seeing she used no bad 
words ; and she being farther interrogate if she knew who it was that turned the 
riddle, she answered that she did not know ; but declared that it was not she, nor 
the other who held it with her, so far as she knew ; and it being told her that if 
neither of them two turned it, that it behoved to be either God or the devil tli.it 
turned it; to which she replied that she did not think it was God, and she hoped 
it was not the devil ; wherefore the minister laboured to convince her of the horrid 
sin of this hellish art, and the heinousness of it, and how she had gone to the devil to 
get knowledge of secret things, and how she might be guilty of blaming innocent per- 
sons, and exhorting her to l.iy her sin to heart and repent, she was removed. And 
the session taking her confession into consider.ition, with tlie hatcfulncss of the 
wicked practice, and after mature deliberation, having the advice of the Presbytery, 
on the like affair, they do unanimously appoint her to make her compearance before 
the congregation three several Sabbaths, to give evidence of her repentance, and for 
the terror of others that use such acts, they refer her to the civil m.igistrato, to be 
punished as shall be thought fit by him, eiliier corporally or pecunially ; and she being 
called ill again this was intimate unto her.'' 



KILMOUIE.

swearing and intemperance are become much more prevalent than 
they were twenty years ago. 

In dwellings, dress, and diet, the people have of late years be- 
come very much assimilated to the peasantry of the low country 
adjoining. The only striking difference is in the head-dress of 
the married females, many of whom still continue to wear the high 
cap, or mutch, instead of bonnets. They, in general, enjoy as 
many of the comforts, and feel as few of the privations of life, as 
others in the same station in more central parts of the kingdom. 
Absolute destitution is a thing unknown among the very poorest, 
and the great majority of those who are above pauperism, enjoy a 
competency of the necessaries of life. 

Poaching is rare. Illicit distillation prevailed till a very recent 
period, to a very considerable extent, but within the last ten years, 
very decided measures were taken for its suppression, and it is now 
almost entirely done away. Its demoralising effects were not de- 
veloped here so prominently, as in other places, from the circum- 
stance of its not being considered a disreputable pursuit, and there 
being few, if any, in the parish, who, at some period of their hves, 
were not engaged in some department of smuggling. To the 
smuggler no stigma was attached on account of his employment ; 
on the contrary, it was considered rather an honourable occupa- 
tion, as exhibiting an intrepidity and art that acquired for their 
possessor a distinction in the minds of his companions. It was ii 
the darkest night, and in the most tempestuous weather, when no 
cruiser would stand the gale, that, in his little skiff, the smuggler 
transported his cargo to the opposite shores of Ayrshire. 

Language. — The language universally spoken is the Gaelic. A 
few families from the Lowlands have of late years settled in the 
parish, and this, together with the increased facilities of communi- 
cation with the low country, has diffused a more general knowledge 
of the English than there was thirty years ago. There are few, 
if any, under thirty years of age, of either sex, who do not under- 
stand it, but still the 5aelic continues the language of common 
conversation. The English is certainly gaining ground ; but we 
do not think that it has displaced the Gaelic to any considerable 
extent, though there is little doubt but in the course of time it 
will have this effect. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish contains about 6650 Scots acres of 
arable land, and about 68,350 waste and in pasture. How much 



GO 



UUTEMIIUE. 



of the latter might be profitably brought under cultivation, has not 
been exactly ascertained, but it is evident that it can only be a 
very small fractional part. Nearly the whole of this tract was, till 
within the last twenty-five years, in a state of undivided common, 
to which all persons, be they cottar or farmer, might send as many 
sheep and yeld cattle as they chose. Hence it sometimes hap- 
pened, that the cottar had more stock on the hill than the farmer 
who paid ten times his rent, and always, that both had upon it 
nearly as many times more than it could feed in summer, or they 
could fodder in winter. In these circumstances, no attention could 
be paid to rearing, and the consequence necessarily was, that both 
sheep and cattle were diminutive and ill-shaped. Of late, the hill, 
as well as the arable ground, has been divided and appropriated, 
and the effect upon the stock has been most beneficial. 

Within the period above-mentioned, there has been the most 
marked improvement upon the dwellings, offices, mode and im- 
plements of husbandry, together with skill in the art, and beauty 
in the workmanship. 

Formerly the dwellings and offices formed an irregular clusjter, 
or hamlet, built generally of dry stones, pointed with mortar. The 
dwelling-house consisted of two apartments, the uppermost being 
the best, and the lower the kitchen. Both formed one end of a range, 
of which the byre formed the other, and a door in the middle was 
common to the inmates of both. Between them, however, there 
was a partition of wicker-work, plastered with mortar, and white- 
washed. 7'he thatch was either of heather, or of fern, or of both, in 
alternate layers, very coarsely put on, ana secured by heather 
ropes, laid across and athwart, kept tight by stones sus- 
pended to their ends, at the eaves. There were no vents. The 
fire was upon a stone in the centre of the apartment, and the 
smoke was allowed to make the best of its way by the door, the 
window, and an aperture for the purpose in the ridge of the roof. 
The offices, which were either attached, or contiguous to this prin- 
cipal range, were of the same materials and construction ; and it 
is obvious that neither could be very durable or comfortable. 

All the lands were undivided, and unenclosed. Each farm was 
leased by a number of individuals, sometimes by as many as ten 
and fifteen, who were jointly and severally liable for the rent. Each 
farm was thus a societas arandi, or township, containing as many 
families, having each an equal interest in its cultivation, each field 
being subdivided into as many stripes, sejarated by a narrow ridge. 



KILMORIE. 

called a " bone," where the stones, weeds, and other rubbish ga- 
thered oft' the land were accumulated. These stripes generally 
changed possessors every second or third year, according to ar- 
rangement of parties. The milch cows grazed in common upon 
the pasture lands, which lay between the arable and the hill com- 
mon ; but when the crops were secured at the end of autumn, 
sheep, cattle, horses, and swine, ranged at large over the whole 
farm. It is obvious that this associated form of occupany preclu- 
ded all draining, enclosing, laying down in grass, &amp;c. ; in short, 
presented an insuperable barrier to all improvements either of 
stock or ofland. These large farms have in most instances been 
divided into a number of smaller ones, which have been let to one 
person, on leases varying from seven to nineteen years. An op- 
portunity and impetus have thus been given to individual industry 
and enterprise, which has not been lost. On each of these lots, 
comfortable dwellings and commodious offices have been built. A 
great quantity of waste land has been reclaimed, partly by the 
spade, and partly by the plough ; the. whole, in most cases, 
thoroughly drained, and subdivided into fields of suitable size by 
quickset ditches. 

The arable land, under the former system, was divided into in- 
field and outfield. The latter was exclusively devoted to white 
crop, which was taken off in succession, as long as it would return 
more than the seed, and then suffered to lie lea for six or seven 
years, when it again underwent the same exhausting process. The 
infield rotation was, 1. potatoes; 2. oats or bear, with manure; 
3. mashlam, or oats, or beans and peas mixed ; 4. bear with ma- 
nure ; 5. peas ; 6. oats ; 7. bear, with manure ; then potatoes 
as before. This rotation was by no means uniform, but varied 
with the quality of the soil, and the quantity of the manure they 
had to use. The bear was generally sown in beds, and the seed, 
instead of being harrowed in, was covered over with earth from a 
trench. The present rotation is, I. oats ; 2. green-crop ; 3. 
bear, or oats ; a few sow barley or wheat ; 4. rye-grass ; 5. two 
or three years in pasture. 

The Duke of Hamilton, to whose property alone the improve- 
ments apply, affords the greatest facilities, and holds out the ut- 
most encouragements to improvement, by sharing the expenses, 
directing the operations, and rewarding their proper execution. 

The implements of husbandry were formerly of their own making, 
and of the simplest and rudest description. The plough was all of 



62 



BUTESHIRE. 



wood, except llie coulter, sole and share, and most coarsely and 
clumsily constructed. No stone, however much in the way, or 
however near the surface, was ever disturbed. To break the 
plough was therefore a thing of annual, or perhaps weekly occur- 
rence,— a thing that they regularly calculated upon, for which 
they made prudent provision, and which caused them little delay 
in their spring operations. An assortment of beams, stilts, &amp;c. 
was always on hand, and what was broken in the forenoon was 
either repaired or replaced by the evening. The harrow con- 
sisted of three bills, generally having iron, but sometimes only 
wooden teeth, and so very light, that the harrowing was fre- 
quently a more tedious operation than the ploughing. The plough 
was drawn by four or six horses driven by one man, while two 
others followed with spades to level down the inequalities of the 
furrow and delve up what the plough did not turn. There were 
no carts in the parish till about forty years ago, nor indeed were 
there roads to use them on. In their stead, they employed cars or 
sledges, formed of two parallel trams, about four feet asunder, 
joined at the further end by cross bars. The horse was yoked in 
it as in a cart, but the trams, instead of being supported on wheels, 
slid on the ground. On these creels were fixed, in which they put 
whatever they had to carry. 

The harness was of a piece with the carriage. A thick withe 
of strong straw or rushes, twisted hard together, served for a col- 
lar; two bent pieces of stick fastened at the ends with a leather 
thong, or birch twig, for haimes ; a hair or rush rope for halter, 
and all the other parts in keeping. 

The implements and harness are now the workmanship of regu- 
lar tradesmen, the latter generally imported from the low country. 
Iron ploughs are common, carts universal, and farming operations 
carried on with the same ease and order, as in the more advanced 
agricultural districts of Scotland. The introduction of these im- 
provements is partly owing to the younger members of families 
going to service in these districts, and thus learning the system 
there pursued, which on their return they continue at home. 

Rent, Sfc. — The average rent of the arable land is L.l per acre ; 
the average grazing of a cow or full grown ox, L. 2, and of an ewe, 
4s. 6d. per annum. Labourers wages. Is. 6d. per day; masons, 
3s. 6d.; Wrights, 2s. 6d. ; tailors. Is. 6d. with victuals ; weavers 
receive Gd. per yard for linen, 5d. for ham, 4d. for plaiding ; shoe-

makers charge Is. 3d. with victuals for making a pair of shoes ; 
servants receive the same wages that they do in Ayrshire. 

fisheries. — The herring- fishery is carried on at the north end 
to a considerable extent, and the white fishing on the south, but 
on a very limited scale, owing partly to the want of enterprise in 
those who pursue it, and partly to the difficulty of getting the fish 
carried fresh to market. There are no fisheries rented in the pa- 
rish. 

Produce. — The average gross amount of raw produce raised 
in the parish, as nearly as can be ascertained, is as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, wheat, oats, meal, barley, &amp;c. . L. 3420 



Potatoes. .... 3000 

Butter and cheese, . ... 750 

Black cattle, . . ... 2150 

Sheep and wool, . . . . 1875 

Swine, . . . , . 400 

Fowls and eggs, .... . 460 



Herring and white fish, caught by 60 boats, L. 35 each, 2100 
Shell-fish, lobsters, &amp;c. . . . . 100 

There are about 90 boats belonging to the parish. Of these 
the largest is about twelve tons burthen, the average four and a- 
half. Those engaged in the herring-fishing employ three men, 
the others two. 

An agricultural society was instituted on the island, about eight 
years ago, which, by its premiums for ploughing, rearing, and crop- 
ping, has contributed, more than anything else, in forwarding the 
improvements in stock and farming operations. It has excited 
among the farmers a spirit of emulation, which has urged them 
to make improvements that even self interest would not have im- 
pelled them to. 

V. — Paiiochial Economy. 
There is neither market-town nor market in the parish. All 
the disposable produce must therefore be exported to the oppo- 
site towns of Ayr, Campbelton, and Ardrossan, — the nighest of 
which is twelve, and the most distant eighteen miles, of an open 
and boisterous sea. There are no harbours ; at least none which 
a vessel can enter, except at high water, and the largest of them 
will not, even then, adrnit vessels of more than fifteen tons. There 
is a packet-boat from Southend to Ayr, and another from Black- 
water to Campbelton, which have each of them a small salary, 
levied from the tenantry in proportion to, and along with their rent. 
At the former place two converging whin dikes form a natural 
basin, in which the packet lies, and at the latter, a small harbour 
was constructed by the parliamentary commissioners. But neither 



64 



BUTESHIRE. 



of them can accommodate more than half a dozen vessels, nor ad- 
mit them, except at full tide. Should they approach the coast at 
any other time they must stand off till it flows, and, however tem- 
pestuous be the weather, they have no nigher place of shelter 
to run to than the one they left. It is therefore with consider- 
able danger and damage that the communication with these ports 
is carried on. Commodious harbours, that could at all times of 
the tide admit vessels of thirty tons, are very much required at 
both these places, and might be constructed at no very great ex- 
pense. 

Roads. — An excellent parliamentary road extends from Black- 
water Foot to Brodick. Two other roads, almost equally good, ex- 
tend, one from Blackwater Foot, along the shore, to Largybeg, the 
other from Benecarigan across the island, to Lamlash. This last 
was made by the inhabitants, at the expense of the Duke of Ha- 
milton, generally by those of them who had fallen behind in their 
rents, during the transition state of agriculture, and who by this means 
paid up their arrears. The former of them was made, and both are 
upheld, by the statute labour and three additional days, which, 
by their leases, the tenantry are bound to work at roads, mill- 
dams, and water-courses. The labour is directed by an overseer, 
who calls out the different districts in rotation, superintends the work, 
and sees that it be properly executed. Bridges have been erected 
over all the rivers and streams on his Grace's property, with the 
exception of Blackwater, Machey, and lorsa, vvhich lie on its 
confines, and contiguous to that of Mrs Westenra. On this the 
roads are very indifferent, and there are no bridges. 

There is no post-office in the parish. The nighest are those of 
Brodick and Lamlash, both subordinate to Saltcoats, from which 
the mail is conveyed to both twice a week in winter, and daily in 
summer, by a steam-packet belonging to the island. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church was rebuilt on its ori- 
ginal site at Kilmorie in 1785, It is a long, low, narrow build- 
ing, with Gothic windows and a gallery in both ends. The latter 
erected in 1 824. An aisle or outshot, with gallery, was added in 
1810. It accommodates 832, and all the sittings are free, and 
most of them unappropriated. Its situation is far from central. 
It is six miles from the southern, and twenty-four from the north- 
€rn extremity of the parish. The country around it is pretty 
densely inhabited, but there are other parts, about eight miles dis- 
tant, that are equally so. There, also, there is a church where Divine 



KILMORIE. 



65 



worship is perforaied hy the parish minister every third Sabbath. 
It was rebuilt on its original site at Clachan in 1805, at the expense 
of the parishioners and others, among whom it is divided, and by 
whom it is upheld according to their respective subscriptions. It is 
seated for about 640. There is another church at Lochranza, built 
in 1795, and seated in 1835 to accommodate about 300 ; chiefly at 
the expense of the people. A licentiate of the church regularly offi- 
ciates in it, and acts as catechist or assistant to both the ministers 
of Arran, taking charge of the northern extremities of both parishes, 
from lorsa in the one, to Corrie in the other. He is paid by a mor- 
tification made for that purpose by the Duchess Anne of Hamilton 
about the year 1700, amounting to L. 27 per annum. Small 
as that sum now seems, and inadequate as it now is, to procure more 
than the mere necessaries of life, it Was, at the time it was given, 
fully equal to the stipends of the beneficed clergy of the island. 
The farm of Coillemore, on which the incumbent i-esided, was at 
a later period attaclied to it, at a nominal rental ; but during a re- 
cent lengthened vacancy, it was let to another tenant, and has not 
since been restored, nor any equivalent given in its room. All that 
now, therefore, the incumbent has to subsist on, is the original sum of 
L. 27, with the interest of accumulated vacant stipend, amounting 
to L 13, 1 Is., which, being at the disposal of the kirk-session of 
Kilmorie and Kilbride, is generally, though not always, given to 
the officiating minister at this station. Unfortunately, the deed 
of mortification expressly prohibits the ordination of the assistant, 
and, being engrossed in that of entail, cannot be altered. This 
want of ordination is felt to be a very great grievance by the inha- 
bitants, who must travel a distance, many of them of twenty-four 
miles, before they can obtain sealing ordinances. The Lord's 
supper has been but twice dispensed in the district,— first in 1814, 
during the incumbency of the Rev. Neil M'Bride, and in 1839, 
by the Rev. A. Macmillan. 

The manse of Kilmorie is the original one, built shortly after 
the Revolution, and is said to be the oldest now inhabited in Scot- 
land. It was at first roofed with thatch, but, being burnt in 1710, 
it was repaired and roofed with slate. With that exception, it has 
received little repair, and no addition, since its erection. It is in 
very indifferent condition, but, though condemned upwards of forty 
years since, no application has ever been made for a new one. The 
glebe is about 1 1 acres and 3 roods, inclusive of church-yard and 
garden, and is worth about L. 14 per annum. The stipend is 15 

BUTE. E

chalders, half meal, half barley, and averages L. 210. The far- 
mers of the south end district, i. e. from Largybeg to Corriecravie, 
give each of them annually a cart of peats to the clergyman. 

The patronage of Kilmorie belongs to the Duke of Hamilton, 
and that of Lochranza to his Grace, and the two ministers of 
Arran conjointly. That of Kilmorie, originally was in the Abbey 
of Kilwinning, and in 1600 the parish was united to the Presby- 
tery of Irvine. The names of the clergymen who have successively 
been its ministers, are the Rev. Dugald Bannatyne, who was trans- 
lated to Irvine ; Charles Bannatyne, his son ; James Stewart, tran- 
slated to it from Kilbride ; John Hamilton ; Mr Smith ; Neil 
Macbride ; Dugald Crawford ; Angus Macmillan. 

In so extensive a parish, the attendance upon public worship 
must necessarily be much affected by the weather. When that is 
favourable, the church is sometimes insufficient to contain the 
congregation that assembles ; and when this is the case, which is 
now much'seldomer than it used to be, the minister preaches in a 
tent. During the ministry of Mr Macbride, seldom or never was 
it conducted in the church, and even in winter, when it was, crowds 
stood outside the doors, that could not be accommodated within. 
A spirit of indifference prevails among the rising generation, that 
painfully contrasts with that which animated their fathers, in re- 
gard to the means of grace. Still the attendance, though far from 
what it once was, is as good as in most parishes of the same popu- 
lation. The average number of communicants for the seven years 
preceding 1831, was 1030. The number of individuals belonging 
to Established Church, 3978; other religious denominations, 17. 

There are no religious associations in the parish, nor are collec- 
tions regularly made for any, except the Assembly's schemes. The 
average amount for each of them is L. 6. 

Education.— There are 12 schools in the parish, viz. four pa- 
rochial, two on the Assembly's scheme, and in the remaining six, 
the teachers are either salaried by the inhabitants of the district, 
or paid by the fees of the scholars. The branches generally taught, 
are, Gaelic and English reading, writing, and arithmetic. In the 
parochial and Assembly's schools, in addition to these elementary 
branches, English grammar, book-keeping, navigation, geogra- 
phy, and mathematics are taught. The salaries of the parochial 
teachers are respectively, Kilmorie, L. 17, 10s.; Shisken, L. 15; 
Imachar, L. 5, 16s. ; Lochranza, L.IO, 10s. All, with the excep- 
tion of Imachar, have also a dwelling-house, garden, and glebe-

The fees in all the schools are, for reading, 2s. per quarter ; read- 
ing and writing, '2s. 6d. ; these with arithmetic, f3s, ; navigation 
and book-keeping, L. 1 per course. 

There are none between the age of six and fifteen but who either 
can, or are learning to read; and the greater number of those of fifteen 
can also write. From fifteen to fifty there are none but can read, 
and the must of them can also write. There are a considerable num- 
ber of individuals above fifty who cannot write, but few, if any, 
who cannot read. There is a universal desire among the people 
to have their children taught, at least the elementary branches of 
education. The number of private schools in the parish is clear 
evidence of this fact. The endowed schools are more num,erously 
attended ; the teachers better qualified, and the children better 
taught. Of these at least three additional are required ; one at 
Machry water foot ; the one at Imachar more fully endowed ; one 
at Auchemore, and one at Benan. 

The establishment of the General Assembly's schools in 1828, 
formed a new and interesting era in the history of education in 
this parish. The introduction by them of a more rational, effi- 
cient, and expeditious system of education, speedily supplanted in 
the others that formerly pursued ; "while the energy displayed by 
their teachers, and the spirit infused by them into the children'; 
the interest and pleasure they made them take in what they be- 
fore felt to be an irksome task, and the rapid progress they con- 
sequently made, gave a stimulus, while it set a pattern to those 
others, which has completely changed their character and appear- 
ance. This, together with the religious instruction communicated, 
in a manner that makes what they repeat intelligible to the pupils, 
will, it is hoped, exercise asalutary influence on the rising generation. 
The teachers of the Assembly's schools merit the highest com- 
mendation, for the assiduity, ability, and zeal exhibited by them 
in theirprofession, andsustained unabated for upwards of eight years, 
during which they have been established. The school taught by 
Mr M'Kelvie at Little Mill, deserves special notice, and is de- 
cidedly the best in the parish ; indeed, it is seldom that its equal 
will be found any where. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The average number of persons 
receiving parochial aid for the last ten years, is 75 ; and the ave- 
rage sum allowed each, is 16s. Some get as low as 6s. and 8s. ; 
and some as high as L. 2. The average annual amount of church 
collections during the same period, is L. 46. This sum, with the 
proclamation dues, which annually average L. 6 ; and the interest 



68. 



BUTESHIRE. 



of L. 30, bequeathed by the late Major Macalister of Sprinkbank, 
is the only provision for the support of the poor. Application for 
parochial aid is decidedly considered degrading, and none but such 
as are paupers in the strictest sense of the term apply for it. So 
long as the funds for the support of the poor are furnished by the 
congregation, the provision is regarded as a public charity," and 
relief from this source is therefore the last resort of the indigent, 
but were it levied by assessment, it would no longer be viewed in 
this light. The love of idleness would speedily overcome the 
pride of independence, and there would then be as much avidity 
manifested to seize upon it, as there is now aversion to accept of it. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held in the parish, all for the sale 
of horses, viz. one at Lag, and two at Shedog. 

Inns and Ale-houses. — There are three inns, viz. Lag, Shedog. 
and Lochranza J and three ale-houses. Here, as elsewhere, their 
influence is pernicious, which is still the more grievous as their ex- 
istence is unnecessary. More individuals addicted to spirits are 
to be found in their vicinity, than anywhere else in the parish, 
though we cannot say that in the whole of it there is one drunk- 
ard. 

Fuel. — The fuel universally used is peat, which is found in great 
abundance on the hills throughout all parts of the island. A few 
of the larger farmers who are close upon the shore, and at a dis- 
tance from the peat-moss, supply themselves partly with coals from 
the opposite coast of Ayrshire.

PRESBYTERY OF GREENOCK, SYNOD OF GLASGOW AND AYR. 

THE REV. JAMES DRUMMOND, MINISTER. 



I. Topography and Natural History. 

Name.—BiG Cumbray is an island in the Frith of Clyde, 
four miles east from the Island of Bute ; two miles west from 
the parish of Largs ; and nearly one mile north from the Little 
Cumbray. The name is said to come from a Gaelic word, which 
sio-nifies a bold or steep coast rising abruptly from the sea ; 
and this agrees perfectly with the natural appearance of the 
island, which presents steep and precipitous banks all round the 
coast. There is, indeed, a flat level space round the whole island, 
extending from the bottom of those banks to the water's edge, but 
the whole of this space has been, at one time or other, completely 
covered with the sea. This is evident from the fields of sand and 
beds of marl which it contains ; and if so, its appearance then 
would exactly agree with what its name signifies. Its figure is very 
irregular. It extends about 3 miles in length from north-east to 
south-west, about 2 miles in breadth, and from 10 to 11 miles 
in circumference, and contains upwards of 5120 square acres. 
The shore, which is, as already stated, flat and level for some con- 
siderable distance from the sea, is, in some places, sandy, as ui 
Kames Bay, on the south-east of the island, and immediately ad- 
joining the east end of the village of Millport ; and in Fintry Bay 
on the west and north-west, extending along the beach for nearly 
a mile of pure sand ; in some places, also, it is clayey and gravelly, 
but in most places it is rocky. 

Topographical Appearnnces.— There is a range of hills called 
the Shoughends, which run from south to north, extending nearly 
the whole length of the island in that direction. All the other 
hills, which may be considered as so many subordinate connec- 
tions of this range, rise, with gradual ascent, from the extremities 
of the island to its centre, where the height above the level of the 
sea is nearly 500 feet. From all these, the views are delights

ful, especially from the centre, which is the highest, where the 
view extends all round the island, comprehending the whole sur- 
rounding scenery,— the parishes of Largs and Kilbride on the 
east ; the whole coast of Ayr, Ailsa rock, and "the island of Ar- 
ran, together with Little Cumbray, and the two ancient castles of 
Cumbray and of Portincross, on the south ; the peninsula of Can- 
tyre, and the Island of Bute on the west ; and, on the north, the 
whole sweep of the Clyde, with its vast navigation, and all its va- 
ried scenery on both its banks. 

Climate.— From its insular situation, the temperature of the 
atmosphere is more equable than on the mainland, for it is neither 
so hot in the summer, nor so cold in the winter. The winds which 
most generally prevail are from the south and west, both of which 
frequently bring rain ; those from the north and east bring cold. 
The adjacent hills, both in Bute and in the mainland, being 
higher than those in Cumbray, more naturally attract the clouds; 
hence, in Cumbray, there is less moisture than in either of those 
places, and consequently, a more genial atmosphere ; and there 
being neither marshy ground, stagnant water, public works, nor, 
indeed, any thing to contaminate the air, it is exceedingly pure 
and salubrious. Snow very seldom lies for any great length of 
time, and for the same reason, frost is seldom, if ever, very severe. 
The climate is, therefore, most agreeable, and hence, the inhabi- 
tants are, in general, healthy and strong; less frequently visited 
by fevers, consumptions, or contagious diseases than their neigh- 
bours, and even when they are so visited, the consequences are 
less fatal. In common, indeed, with all mankind, the people have 
their complaints, but no particular disease can be mentioned as 
more prevalent than another. 

Hydrography.~T\\e parish everywhere abounds with excellent 
spring water, generally rather hard, but, from the very limited ex- 
tent of the island, no rivers of any magnitude are to be found. It 
is, however, rather a curious circumstance, that at the top of the 
very highest part of the island, there is a hollow place where there 
are two small lochs or lakes, communicating with each other, 
whence there issues a small rivulet, which, in its descent toward the 
sea, being augmented by other smaller streams and springs, at last 
becomes sufficiently large to form a mill-dam of considerable di- 
mensions, by the help of which the people are enabled to grind 
their own corn. 

Geology and Mineralogy. — The varieties of rock found in 



CUMBRAY. 



71 



tlie island are very considerable. The brown, or rotten whin, as 
it is called, and which may be said to form the base of most of 
the hills, is full of seams, and very hard, and when broken down, 
makes good stuff for roads. The hard blue whin has fewer 
seams, but is more durable, and is frequently used in building. 
These are frequently intersected with veins of quartz, and of va- 
rious other substances. The freestone, which is in great plenty, 
is of various kinds : the common white or sandstone is of the best 
quality for building, and a reddish brown sandstone, of fine grain, 
hard and durable, makes excellent pavements ; of the latter, 
there is a softer kind, which, though it becomes harder when ex- 
posed to the air, is less durable, and is, therefore, not so much 
used. The beds of freestone along the coast are frequently 
found thickly studded with small pieces of quartz, like pebbles, 
forming fine specimens of what is called plumb-puddingstone. 
These beds, or strata of rocks, commonly run from north-west to 
south-east ; their depth or thickness varies from nine to twelve 
feet, and their inclination from three to seven inches per foot. They 
are often intersected with veins of whin, which run in all direc- 
tions, and which frequently rise considerably above the surface, 
assuming the appearance of dikes. The most remarkable of these 
are two on the east side of the island, running nearly parallel, and 
from five to six hundred yards distant from each other. Their di- 
rection is from north-west, where they spring from the hill, to the 
south-east, where they disappear in the sea. The one to the north- 
east measures upwards of 40 feet in height, nearly 100 in length, 
and in mean thickness from 10 to 12 feet. The one to the south- 
west is upwards of 200 feet in length, from 12 to 15 in thick- 
ness, and from 70 to 80 feet in height where it joins the hill, but 
droops considerably towards the sea ; and, when viewed in a cer- 
tain direction, exhibits the distant resemblance of a lion couching, — • 
hence it is sometimes called the Lion. These dikes are compos- 
ed of blue whin, with joints and seams like basalt, but not in 
columns, and must have been originally produced by some dread- 
ful concussion in nature. The same dikes appear again in the op- 
posite side of the channel, in the parishes of Kilbride and of 
Stevenston, and run through the whole of Ayrshire and of Gallo- 
way, elevating and generally improving the strata of coal and of 
freestone on the west side. There is also plenty of limestone found 
in the island, which might be wrought to great advantage, were it

not I'of the expense of coal, which must iiW be brought at great ex- 
pense, either from Glasgow, Ardrossan, or Ayr. 

Soil. — The soil is varied. On the higher parts of the island, 
it is light, gravelly, and thin, tending to moss, bedded on rock, and 
covered with heath ; but in some of the valleys it consists of rich 
black loam of considerable depth, bedded on clay of various de- 
scriptions, and producing good crops. All along the coast, however, 
it is light and sandy, bottomed generally on rock or clay. On the 
south end of the island, it abounds with marl, and, excepting in 
very dry seasons, produces crops of the most excellent quality. 

Zoology. — From the insular situation, and limited extent of the 
parish, there are no species of wild animals found here, excepting 
rabbits, of which there are great abundance ; hares once existed in 
the island, but are now completely extirpated; and the domesticani- 
mals are only such as are common to all the surrounding parishes. 
The shores and bays all round the island abound with fish of va- 
rious kinds, the chief of which are, haddock, cod, whitings, lyth, 
mackerel, salmon-trout, and herrings. These last, however, have, 
of late years, greatly diminished, so much so, indeed, that herring- 
fishing, as such, has been almost totally abandoned. Shell-fish 
are plenty, and are of some advantage to the inhabitants. They 
include all the varieties found on the neighbouring shores, and 
others also which are not so common, such as :

Oysters are also occasionally found in small quantities, but are lit- 
tle valued by the people. The species of sponge, Halichondria 
infundibuliformis, is also found here. 

Of zoophytes, there are great variety, such as, 

Anthea Tucdise Cornularia rugosa llippotliea catcnularia 

Antennularia antennina Sertularia pumila Lucernaria fascicularis 

Campanularia geniculata ™ filicula Tubularia patina 

Lepralia coccinea ■ operculata ; serpens 

. ciliata Farcimia salicornia Crisia eburnea 

Cellularia reptans Flustra membranacea coniuta 

ciliata pilosa — luxata 

 piimieosa 

Botany. — All the plants which are found in the neighbouring 
parishes are found here in great abundance, and many others which 
are of less frequent occurrence, such as —

Solanum Dulcamara Aiithemis nobilis Anagallis tenella 

Hyoscyamus niger Trifolium fragifei um Pinguicula lusitatiica 

Coiiium maculatum Lithospermum maritiraum Veronica anagallis, &amp;c. &amp;c. 

Heaths also of various kinds, such as common white heath, fine- 
leaved white heath, cross-leaved white heath, &amp;c. &amp;c. with great 
varieties of medicinal herbs, too tedious to mention. 

Till lately, there were but few trees in the parish ; in- 
deed, with the single exception of some eight or ten acres planted 
about fifty years ago on Lord Glasgow's property, there was nothing 
in the shape of plantation "in the whole island ; but since 1822 the 
Earl of Glasgow has planted upvards of 120 acres, all in the 
form of beltings. The places so planted have been very well 
chosen, the trees are thriving well, and tend at once both to shelter 
the fields and to beautify the island. These plantings consist of com- 
mon Scotch fir, Weymouth pine, common larch, black and white 
spruce, common and mountain-ash tree, common birch, common 
chesnut tree, oriental plane-tree, English elm, common Scotch 
oak, common Hme tree, common and Huntingdon willow, Bed- 
ford and Canadian poplar tree, Cytisus, laburnum, &amp;c. &amp;c. Be- 
sides these, there are also a few others round some of the farm 
houses, but none of any great note, excepting one at Ballykellet, a 
very large ash tree, and evidently of very long standing ; it is sup- 
posed to contain upwards of 65 feet sohd, and measures 10 feet in 
circumference. 

H. — Civil History. 
From the want of particular documents respecting the parish, 
its history is very much involved in obscurity. There is, indeed, a 
parish register, which is regularly kept, but it extends little farther 
back than 100 years, the date of its first entry being in October 
1730. From this circumstance very little is known of its ancient 
history, only that it seems at one time to have been in the posses- 
sion of the Norwegians, and, consequently, to have been very of- 
ten the subject of contest between them and the Scots. This con- 
test, however, seems to have ended with the battle of the Largs, 
when these Norwegians were completely routed and driven from 
the coast. Tradition points out a place here, on the brow of a hill, 
where some of these invaders lay encamped, but no traces of the 
camp itself are now to be seen. Mention is also made of a cathedral 
which once stood here, and wliich is said to have been dedicated 
to Saint Columba, but of this nothing is known by the inhabitants, 
and certainly no remains are to be seen. That such an establisli- 
ment, however, did really exist, is highly probable, both from the 



74 



BUTESIIIRF.. 



known principles of the Roman Catholics, which led them to leave 
no inhabited place without a religious establishment, and also from 
the certain existence of tradition concerning it; and the tradition 
receives additional confirmation from the folfowing circumstance, 
which lately occurred. 

In the year 1823, some labourers, in removing the surface of 
the grolmd, for the purpose of opening up a quarry, found a large 
stone of rather a singular appearance ; it was upwards of 8 feet 
in length, by 2 in breadth, and 1| in thickness. Its form was 
somewhat similar to a coffin, but not so deep ; with a ridge cros- 
sing the whole breadth of the bottom ; inside rising nearly half as 
high as the ledges, and dividing the whole length into two un- 
equal parts, the one 3, and the other 5 feet, and having no cover. 
At the broadest, or head-end of this stone, there stood erect a 
stone cross, which seemed originally to have been of very fine 
workmanship. This cross stood close to the former stone, its or- 
namental side facing it, its foot sunk about 2 feet into the earth, 
and its head rising above the stone about 1  feet. The hill from 
whence these stones were dug, and in which they had been buried 
to the depth of 5 or 6 feet, was only an accumulation of sand 
drifted from the sea, heaped up upon what had once been the 
surface of the ground, and upon which these stones had been for- 
merly laid. All this accumulation of sand has been since remov- 
ed. The larger stone was immediately broken into pieces of more 
convenient size for the purposes of building ; the cross also was 
broken into two pieces, from the same economical purposes, but 
the head-piece was afterwards recovered, and is at present, 1840, 
in the possession of the minister of the parish. 

Land-owners. — The whole island now belongs to the Earl of Glas- 
gow and to the Marquis of Bute. Lord Glasgow, who is also patron 
of the parish, possesses two-thirds, and Lord Bute one-third of the 
parish. It was formerly divided into a number of small baronies, 
the names of some of which are still remembered, such as the 
Karnes, which gives name to one of the finest bays in the island, 
close to what is now called the New Town : on this property, 
the small village of Kames once stood, some ruins of which may 
still be traced ; the family name was Hunter. The Hill, on which 
property the whole of the new town now stands ; the family name 
was also Hunter, some of whose descendants are still in the island. 
Craigengour, the family name of which was also Hunter. The 
Covans, and the Troughewan, on which property part of the village 



CUMBRAY.

of Millport now stands ; the family name was Stewart. ' Pen- 
machrie, on the lands of which the village of the Sheriff's 
Auld Haw once stood ; the family name here also was Stewart. 
Ballykellet, which seems to have been the most considerable of 
the whole ; the family name was Montgomerie ; the last male 
survivor was Sir Robert. With the exception of the Kames, the 
Hill, and Craigengour, all of which were but small properties, this 
family seems to have possessed all that part of the island which 
now belongs to Lord Glasgow, together with the patronage of the 
parish. Part of this ancient mansion-house was still standing in 
1837, was then in tolerably good repair, and was, at that time, 
occupied by a farmer ; but since then it has been 'semoved, m 
order to make way for some improvements on the farm. The fa- 
mily arms, cut out in one entire stone, with the family motto, Garde 
Men at the head, and the names of both the proprietors. Sir Ro- 
bert Montgomerie, and Dame Margaret Douglas at the foot, 
still served to ornament , the front of the old parish church till 
1837, when the church was rebuilt, and when, of course, that an- 
cient stone was removed, and it now occupies a corner in'the manse 
garden. The last of this family of whom anything is known 
was Dame Margaret Montgomerie, daughter of the above Sir 
Robert, who was killed on the green at Largs by the horse on 
which she rode, which first tlirew her, and then struck her with 
his foot, which instantly caused her death. Near to this site, 
there is a large stone set up on end, upwards of 6 feet in height, 
besides what is sunk in the earth, which stone most probably marks 
the last retreat of some ancient hero. On the lands of this ba- 
rony, there has been lately erected a mill for grinding corn. 
There is no other building in the parish that deservesjto be par- 
ticularly mentioned. 

HI. — Population. 
Withm the last sixty or seventy years, the population of this pa- 
rish has increased fourfold.

reside in the country. The average of births for the last seven 
years is 31 ; of deaths, 11 ; of marriages, 6.

All these are divided into 226 families, containing, at an average' 
three children in each ; together with 16 men above 60, who are 
either bachelors or widowers and 54 women above 45, who are 
either widows or unmarried. During the summer months the po- 
pulation is greatly increased, there being sometimes 400 strangers 
present at one time in the parish, for the purpose of sea-bathing. 

Neither of the Noble heritors are resident in the parish, 
nor are there any individuals of independent fortune in the island. 
Lord Glasgow, indeed, occasionally resides for a few weeks in a 
house formerly called the Garrison, built on Lord Bute's property, 
by the late James Crawfurd, Esq. Captain of the Royal George 
Revenue Cutter, the lease of which his Lordship bought, and which 
house has since obtained the name of the Priory. This, however, 
is but a very temporary residence. There are 15 houses in the 
country, and 144 in the village, all of which are possessed, though 
a few of them only during the summer months, being purposely 
built for sea-bathing quarters. Besides these, there are three 
houses building, but which have not yet been inhabited. 

Character of the People. — The habits of the people are' 
simple ; their houses neat and comfortable, built of stone, and 
generally slated, and being cast with Irish lime, they appear ex- 
treraelv clean, lightsome, and cheerful. To each house there is 
a small garden attached, for the purpose of raising vegetables. 
Besides this, each family is accustomed to procure from the farmers 
in the neighbourhood, a few falls of ground, more or less, accord- 
ing to the number of the family, on which they plant potatoes, 
which, with the vegetables from the garden, and other offals from 
the kitchen, enables them to feed a pig by way of provision for the 
winter. A number of Lord Glasgow's feuars rent a small piece 
of land, in the immediate vicinity of the village, wo acres for each 
family, on which they raise all the common variety of crops ; this 
enables each of those families to keep a cow, and thereby adds 
greatly to their happiness and comfort. These little patches of 
land, being separately inclosed, lying all together, and all in the 
highest degree of cultivation, exhibit very much the appearance of 



CUM BR AY. 



an extensive garden. Among the feuars on Lord Bute's proper- 
ty, this system is carried on in a somewhat different manner. There, 
the whole famihes that keep cows, unite together, have a certain 
piece of land, forming a considerable farm, which they cultivate in 
common, and afterwards divide the produce. The other mode, 
however, is preferable. Besides these small farms, there is, both 
on Lord Glasgow's and on Lord Bute's property, a very conside- 
rable tract of land, that is not arable, by way of common, for the 
use of such families as keep cows, and for which they pay a small 
rent, so that, upon the whole, the people in general are comfort- 
able in their circumstances, contented, and happy. 

IV. — Industry. 
Agriculture. — The parish is supposed to contain about 5120 
square acres, 3000 of which may be considered as arable. Of 
the remaining 2000, the commons on the respective properties 
contain about 30 acres : 120 have been planted, which, be- 
ing excellently well managed, as to pruning, thinning, &amp;c. are 
now beginning to be of some little use : 300 or 400 acres more 
might easily be rendered arable by a little judicious management, 
such as draining, liming, fencing, &amp;c. in all of which departments 
there is great room for improvement. This, however, the tenants 
cannot be expected to do without obtaining longer leases than those 
which they have been accustomed to obtain, and which are in gene- 
ral only for nineteen years ; and the proprietors have not yet been 
disposed to advance the capital necessary for carrying on such im- 
provements. Upwards of 1400 acres, or rather more than one- 
fifth of the parish, must be considered as wild, and not at all capa- 
ble of any degree of cultivation ; a great part of which, however, af- 
fords pasture for cattle. The higher parts of the parish are most- 
ly covered with heath, whilst some of the banks and valleys are 
beautifully ornamented with all the different kinds of natural brush- 
wood. 

■Rent of Land. — The average rent of arable land may be from 15s. 
to L. 1 per acre ; but of the remainder, not more than from 2s. to Ss 
per acre. The valued rent of the parish is somewhere about 
L.llOO. 

Some of the farm-houses have been lately rebuilt, and are there- 
fore in excellent repair j the rest, however, are in a very indif- 
ferent condition. There are in the parish 58 horses, 538 black- 
cattle, and probably about 60 sheep. 

Although quarrying forms one of the items of trade in the pa- 



78 



BUTESHIRE. 



rish, yet it can scarcely be considered as forming a regular source 
of income. At present, however, it is carried on to a very great ex- 
tent, there being five quarries, and upwards of eighty men employ- 
ed in them, all engaged in cutting out blocks- for the different rail- 
roads in the shires of Ayr and Renfrew. More than half of these 
men, however, are incomers, and, therefore, are not included in 
the population of the parish. 

Produce. — The average amount of raw produce raised in the pa- 
rish may be nearly as follows : 

Grain of all kinds, . L. 2760 0 0 

Green crops of all kinds, . 430 0 0 

Hay. . . . . 225 0 0 

Lands in pasture, . . 1896 0 0 

Gardens, . . . 50 0 0 

Plantations, . ' . 5 0 0 

Quarries, . . . 100 0 0 

Total amount of raw produce, L. 5486 0 0 

Navigation. — The highest order of vessels belonging to the 
place is that of sloops, of which there are fifteen, varying from 
fourteen to forty tons in burthen. There are also at present two 
steam-boats, one of which leaves this every morning for Glasgow, 
and returns again in the evening, calling at all the intermediate 
places, and in the summer months there are several others which 
call in passing to and from Glasgow, Ardrossan, and Ayr. 
V. — Parochial Economy. 

As there is no market-town in the parish, the inhabitants in ge- 
neral repair to Greenock with their merchandise, to which place, 
though at the distance of nearly twenty-four miles, they can pro- 
ceed easily, by the help of steam-boats, in the course of three 
hours. 

Villaffe.— The only village in the parish is Milport, which is 
very pleasantly situated on the south-east corner of the island ; at 
which place, there is an excellent harbour, capable of containing 
vessels of considerable burthen, the depth at low water being six 
feet, and at high water fourteen. Here also, a fine pier has been 
lately erected, mostly by the Marquis of Bute, on whose property 
the harbour stands. Near to this harbour, there is also good an- 
choring ground of considerable extent, and finely sheltered by two 
small rocky islands called the Allans ; to which islands, by means 
of iron rings fastened in the rocks, both vessels belonging to the 
island, and others that resort thither in stormy weather, are moor- 
ed, and where thev can ride in perfect safety during the greatest 
storms. The principal trade of Milport is weaving, which is 



CUMBRAY. 



79 



carried on to a very considerable extent,.and with considerable va™ 
riety, both in plain and in fancy work. Upwards of 60 hands are 
employed in this branch of manufacture. 

Means of Communication. — We have no regular post-office, only 
a receiving-house connected with the post-office at Largs, which is 
the nearest post-town. There is no regularly constructed road in 
the parish, excepting one, which extends from where the old church 
once stood, to the ferry, opposite to Largs, a distance of nearly three 
miles. This road passes through the village of Milport, and is 
kept in good repair. Formerly, the only regular communication 
between this and the mainland was carried on solely by this road, 
which was both inconvenient and precarious, but now, in conse- 
quence of the more easy and more safe conveyance by steam-boats, 
the communication is direct from the village, which saves all the 
trouble and expense of carting for upwards of two miles. 

Ecclesiastical State. — Forseveral hundred years, theparish church 
was situated at a place called Kirktown, the only village of note 
then in the island, and about one-half mile from the place where 
the present town of Milport now stands, and where the great body 
of inhabitants reside. Kirktown, however, has long ago entirely 
disappeared, excepting one single farm-house, which still bears its 
name. The parish church was rebuilt there in 1802, and contain- 
ed 380 sittings, whieh, although sufficiently large at the time of 
its erection, was latterly found to be by far too small for the in- 
creased population of the parish ; accordingly, a petition was pre- 
sented to the heritors, praying them to enlarge the church accom- 
modation. To this request, the heritors, very much to their 
honour, at once acceded ; and in 1837, they built a more 
commodious and elegant church, containing upwards of 750 sit- 
tings, and ornamented in front with a very handsome tower. In 
compliance with the wishes of the people, they have placed it on 
the rising ground immediately behind the town, where it serves at 
once to ornament the place, and accommodate the people. Thus, 
in somewhat less than forty years, the heritors of Cumbray have, 
of their own accord, twice rebuilt the parish church, thereby ma- 
nifesting, in the clearest manner, their attachment to the church, 
and their friendly regard for the best interests of the people. 

Most of the seats in the present church are let, but at very 
small sums, averaging only from Is. to 2s. each sitting. The 
manse was built in 1832, and is of the best order. The glebe con- 
sists of about 6 acres, is fit only for pasture, and may be worth 



80 



BUTESHIRE. 



about L. 10. The stipend amounts to about L. 158, and the 
teinds are exhausted. There are no chapels in the parish in con- 
nexion with the Establishment, and only one Dissenting meeting- 
house, which is connected with the Baptist" persuasion. Their 
preacher receives a stipend of L. 20. All the Dissenters in the 
parish, including those of the Secession, Relief, Independent, 
and Baptist persuasion, amount only to 26. The rest of the po- 
pulation attend the parish church with considerable regularity. 
The number of communicants at the parish church is 300. There 
is a religious society in the parish, in connection with the Esta- 
blished Church, the contributions of which may average about 
L. 25. Besides this, there may be about L. 10 more collected by 
the Established Church for particular purposes. The Dissenters 
have also a Bible and Missionary Society, the contributions to 
which may amount to about L. 6, part of which is collected from 
members of the Establishment. 

Education. — There is only one parish school, where the follow- 
ing branches are taught, viz. English, writing, arithmetic, and 
book-keeping, Latin, mensuration, and navigation. The teacher 
has all the legal accommodations. The salary is the medium, L, 30. 
The average number attending is 68. The fees for the common 
branches of education are 10s. per year for each child. There is 
also a private school, but no endowment, where English, writing, 
and arithmetic are taught. Fees, the same as above ; average 
number attending 56. There is also a small school kept by a fe- 
male, where only reading is taught; terms the same as above; 
average number attending 2 5, making in all 149, i. e. little more than 
one in eight of the population ; a proof that education is not over- 
valued in the parish. In all these, the Scriptures are publicly read, 
and the catechism of the church taught. Besides these, there are 
two Sabbath schools conducted by members of the church, to 
each of which a small library is attached ; there is one also by the 
Dissenters, in all of which the principles of religion are taught. 

Literature. — There is a parish library, containing a considerable 
number of religious, historical, and scientific books, and which is 
managed by the subscribers. 

Charitable and other Institutions. — There is one such society 
in the place which is called the Friendly Society. The members 
pay Is. at entry. They collect according to their necessities, 6d. 
from each member, and vihen that has been expended, they collect 
again. Their reduced members receive 2s. 6d. per week, when 



CUMBUAY. 



81 



unable to work, and 4s. per week when confined to bed. There 
is also a Provident Bank in the parish, instituted in 1836, from 
which time till this date, 1840, there have been opened 104 ac- 
counts, with sums varying from Is. to L..25, 

Amounting in whole to - - L. 1583 18 11

L. 801 16 4 

All the labour is gratuitous, so that the only charge has been 
about L. 6 for stationery; such as pass-books, a ledger, and cash- 
book, all of which will serve for some years. Those of the people, 
however, who are of saving habits, do not always confine them- 
selves to the Provident Bank, but contrive to make the best of 
their money in their own way. They either become feuars, build a 
small house, furnish it, and let it for summer lodgings, or they 
procure a sloop, and become traders ; in both of vvhich ways, if 
they remain steady, they improve their fortune. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The funds for supporting the poor 
arise from the following sources : Collections at the church door, 
which last year amounted to L. 39, 2s. 8d. ; proclamations, L, 1, 
10s. ; mortcloth dues, 10s. ; interest from the bank, L..8, 4s. ild. ; 
in all, L. 49, 7s. 7d. The expenditure for the same year was 
L. 44, 16s. lid.; leaving a balance of L. 4, 10s. 9d. Besides this, 
there is a small fund of L. 45, left by the late Rev. James Adam, 
minister of the parish, the interest of which, according to appoint- 
ment, is to assist in educating poor children. 

The number of poor receiving aid may average about 25, and they 
receive from 2s. 6d. to 6s. per week. From the above-mentioned 
sources, the kirk-session, as managers of the poor, have as yet been 
enabled to support their own poor, and, therefore, have not needed 
to have recourse to any other mode. In common with other pa- 
rishes, they have to lament the decline of that principle of inde- 
pendence which used to characterize Scotland and Scotchmen. 
Parochial aid is now claimed as a matter of right. 

• Besides this, Mr Adam gave in his lifetime, L. 250 to the Presbytery of Irvine, 
for behoof of widows belonging to that Presbytery. He also left I,. 1100 to form 
three bursaries, which are managed by the Ear of Glasgow, the Professor of Di- 
vinity, Glasgow College, aiut the Minister of C\imlir:iy.

Alehouses.— There are 9 ale or public-houses in the parish, 
the effect of which upon the morals of the people is most perni - 
cious. Various attempts have been made, from time to time, both 
to lessen their number, and to restrain their -licentiousness ; but 
the misnamed liberality of the present age opposes all such at- 
tempts, as encroachments on the liberty of the subject. 

Miscellaneous Observations. 

There are two things which have frequently been mentioned 
as being rather opposed to the improvement of the place : the 
largeness of the farms, most of them being of greater extent than 
one man can easily superintend ; and the want of resident heri- 
tors, or men of wealth and influence, who might either propose or 
carry into effect any plan for the public good. 

It has also been often mentioned, that a road round the island 
would be of vast consequence to the parish ; both to the farmer 
in carrying his produce to market, and in collecting his manure 
for the fields ; to the inhabitants in general in their ordinary in- 
tercourse, and to strangers, who visit in the summer months, who 
might be thereby induced to build villas round the shore, and 
consequently to remain in the place, and thereby increase the 
value of the respective properties, and add to the means and re- 
sources of the parish in general.

I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — This parish occupies the southern part of the Island 
of Bute. It takes its name from a promontory forming its extreme 
point to the south, called in the Gaelic language Ceann Garbh, 
which signifies stormy end, or stormy head. 

Extent and Boundaries. —It is 6| miles in length from north to 
south ; and its average breadth is 2 miles. It is bounded on the 
north and north-west by the Loch of Ascog, a part of Loch-fad, 



KINGARTH. 



83 



and Quien loch, wliich separate it from the parish of Rothesay; 
and on the east, south, and west, by the Frith of Clyde. It is ir- 
regular in its figure, being indented by several small bays on both 
sides; but it gradually narrows from its northern extremity, till it 
becomes an isthmus of a mile and a half in breadth, beyond which 
it forms a peninsula of two miles in length, terminating in the pro- 
montory above-mentioned. 

Topographical Appearances.— -The land in general rises consi- 
derably above the level of the sea. The principal hills are Suidhe 
or Suidhe Chatain {the Seat of Catan, 520 feet high, and Saint 
Blane's Hill, 486 feet. The coast to the east and south is for 
the most part rocky, in many places rising precipitously at a little 
distance from the shore, in ridges that appear to have at a former 
period served as a barrier to the sea, and to have been subsequent- 
ly raised by volcanic action to their present level. To the west 
the coast has, in general, a more gentle rise, although it exhibits a 
sitfiilar appearance of a shore elevated above its original position. 
The shore is principally sandy, but to the east and south rocky ; 
and at Kilchatan bay, and on some parts of the west coast, it con- 
tains a stratum of blue clay. The bays are those of Ascog, Scoii- 
lag, and Kilchatan to the east ; and of Scalpsie, Stravanan, and 
Dunagoil, to the west. The only headland is the Garroch-head, 
which has its name corrupted from the Gaelic Ceann Garbh. 

A table, serving to indicate the temperature and pressure of the 
atmosphere, and the prevailing winds in this parish, will be found 
in the Account of the parish of Rothesay. 

The climate is somewhat moist ; but is remarkably healthy, and 
induces invalids to seek it for its singular mildness. No distem- 
per prevails at any .time, that cn reasonably be attributed to any 
peculiarity in the atmosphere, or other local cause ; and cases of 
longevity are very common. 

The Frith of Clyde, which bounds the parish on the east, 
south, and west, is 9 miles in breadth betwixt Scoulag bay on the 
east shore, and the nearest point of Ayrshire, at Largs ; and 8 
miles in breadth between Dunagoil bay on the west shore, and the 
nearest part of the Island of Arran ; and 90 fathoms deep betwixt 
the Garroch-head and Little Cumbrae, where its depth is great- 
est. The water is usually clear; its saltness is diminished by the 
volume of fresh water proceeding from the Clyde and the rivers 
of Cowal in Argyleshire. 

The lakes connected with the parish, all of them forming part 
of Its boundary towards the parish of Rothesay, are, the Loch of

Ascog, containing 75 acres, 1 rood, 28 poles, imperial, of surface; 
Qiiien Loch, containing, 68 acres, 3 roods, 30 poles; and Loch- 
fad, containing about 400 acres. 

Geology. — The soil is in general of a light gravelly or sandy 
nature, though in some places loam and clay are to be found. The 
predominating rocks are old red sandstone with conglomerate, and 
veins, beds, and overlying masses of trap. 

n. — Civil History. 
Of the ancient state of the parish little is known. That it was 
the scene of important events in times of rapine and bloodshed, 
may be inferred from its situation, which exposed it alike to the 
northern invaders, and the ravaging hordes of the Ebudae, in 
their attacks on the neighbouring coasts ; and is indicated by its 
sepulchral antiquities, and the appearances of places of defence 
still remaining. That it flourished in population and in wealth, is 
to be gathered from its remains of religious edifices, of a date 
when the distinction of any place for its sacred erections was no 
bad criterion of the consideration in which it was held for its ge- 
neral prosperity. But materials for an authentic history of it have 
not been found. 

Land-owners. — The lands, for a period extending to several cen- 
turies back, appear to have been held by several proprietors called 
Barons — a local designation still retained. These have, within the 
last hundred and fifty years, been gradually reduced in number; 
and they are at present represented by four owners of a small por- 
tion of land respectively, the rest of the parish being the property 
of the Marquis of Bute. 

Eminent Men.— Of persons connected with the parish who attain- 
ed eminence that has transmitted their memory to posterity, is to be 
mentioned Saint Catan, or Cathanus, whose name is preserved in 
the appellation Kilchatan, Cil-Chatain, the cell or burying place 
f Catan, belonging to the bay so called ; and in that of Suidhe 
Chatain, a hill overlooking the bay, and pointed out as his seat. 
Saint Blane also has here monuments of his fame. Tradition as- 
sio-ns to him this parish as the place of his birth ; adding many 
particulars respecting him grossly fabulous, and not deserving to 
be recorded. He is commonly believed to have been the found- 
er of the original church of Kingarthy of which the ruins remain, 
and which is still called by his name; as is also a hill which as- 
cends from the Garroch-head. 

Parochial Register.— The parochial register commences in the 
year 1648, from which date it is continued with partial interrup- 



KINGARTII. 



85 



tions down to the year 1703. It resumes in 1740, and is regu- 
larly kept till 1820, when it is again interrupted till 1827; from 
which period, it is complete to the present time. It occupies fivp 
volumes. 

Antiquities. — Near the north-east shore of Kilchatan Bay are 
two barrows or tumuli, at a short distance from each other. One 
similar, farther along the same shore, was opened some,time since, 
and some pieces of old weapons were dugout of it. All barrows of 
this description, it is believed, will be found to contain sepulchral' 
remains. 

In the peninsula which connects the northern and southern por- 
tions of the parish, half a mile from the east shore, are what have 
been considered the remains of a Druidical circle. The circle is 
imperfect towards the north-west; but it is distinctly indicated by 
three stones placed upright, at a distance of from 23 to 25 feet 
from each other. They are from 7 to Q\ feet high from the 
surface of the ground; in breadth from4 to 6 feet; and from 15 
inches to 6 feet thick. The circle has been supposed, when entire, 
to have been formed by seven stones ; but the vacant space appears 
to leave room only for two, and to limit the original number to 
five. Nearly half a mile distant, towards the west shore, also 
stand three stones, which have been variously conjectured to have 
been connected with Druidical rites, or to mark a scene of battle, 
and to have served as monuments for persons who fell in it. 
Most probably it was the latter object for which they were erect- 
ed. They are situated on a plain at the foot of a gently rising 
ground, half a mile distant from the bay of Stravanan, where an 
enemy was likely to land ; and indicate a position singularly fa- 
vourable for a defending force. On the other hand, they have 
little appearance of a Druidical erection. They are placed in a 
line running nearly from north to south, and are made to face to- 
wards the east and west ; and although their direction has a slisrht 
inclination towards being circular, the circumstance may have been 
accidental : and if they formed part of a circle it must have been 
greatly larger than that above-mentioned. They stand closer, too, 
than the stones in the former, the distance betwixt them little ex- 
ceeding 7 feet. In dimensions, the stones are both nearly alike. ' 

A mile farther south, on the west shore, is the fort of Dun-na- 
goil {the fortified hill, or rock, of the Lowlanders, near the bay to 
which it gives name. It is formed by a ridge of rock 50 feet high, 
rising with a steep ascent from the sea on the west side, perpendi-. 



86 



BUTESHIRE. 



cular to the north and east, narrow and difficult of access towards 
the south, with a level space of some extent on the summit. 
Along the verge of this space, towards the west and south, are the 
remains of a wall, built apparently for the defence of the place, 
where it was most accessible, the precipitousness of the rock serv- 
ing for a natural defence on the other sides. The external parts 
of this wall appear to have been completely vitrified. The heart 
is formed of stone partially fused. The stone chiefly used in the 
structure is whinstone, of which the rock itself is composed. The 
station is a very advantageous one. It commands the most natu- 
ral, and perhaps the best landing-place on the whole coast ; and 
it affords a complete view seawards, at once of the passage from the 
western seas by Kilbranan sound, and of the entrance into the 
Frith of Clyde from the south. All surmises as to its era or use 
are now vain. It has been conjectured to have been a Danish 
fort ; its name would rather point it out to have been a hold, oc- 
cupied, for whatever purpose, by inhabitants of the neighbouring 
eastern or southern coasts, who, in common with those who dwelt 
in the interior southern portion of Scotland, were usually describ- 
ed in the Gaelic tongue by the term signifying Loiolander, as re- 
tained in the designation of this place. 

, Towards the centre of the peninsula, stands the ruin of the 
church or chapel of St Blane, supposed to have been founded by 
the saint whose name it bears, who flourished about the close of 
the tenth century. That a church existed here at a period not 
much posterior, and that he was commonly regarded as having 
been a benefactor to it, there is evidence still extant to show. In a 
charter given by Allan, son of Walter the Second, Great Steward of 
Scotland, dated before the year 1204, conveying certain grants to 
the monastery of the Clunian order at Paisley, is contained the fol- 
lowing clause : — " Also, for the benefit of the soul of King David, 
and the soul of King Malcolm, and the souls of Walter my father, 
and Eschene my mother ; and for the salvation of our Lord Wil- 
liam, King of Scotland, and his heirs, and the salvation of myself 

 " Praetcrca ego ipse pro aniina regis David, et pro anima regis Malcomi, et pro 
anima patris mei Walteri, et matris meae Eschene, et pro salute domiui nostri Wilel- 
mi regis Scotie, et heredum suorum, et pro salute mei ipsius, et heredum meorum, 
dono, concedo, et hac mea carta confirmo cidem domui de Passelet, et monacliis ibi- 
dem Deo servientibus, ecclesiam de Kingaif in insula de Bote, cum omnibus capellis 
et tota parochia ejusdem insulse, et cum tota terra quam sanctus Blanissicumdicitur 
olim cinxit a mari usque ad mare per metas certas et apparentes." Registrum Mo- 
nastcrii de Passelet. Printed by the Maitland Club. 



KINGARTH.

and my heirs : I give, grant, and by this my deed, convey to the 
said monastery at Paisley, and the monks serving God therein, the 
church of Kingaif Kingarth in the island of Bute, with all the 
chapels and the whole parish of that island, together with the 
whole of those lands of which the boundaries, said to have been 
fixed by St Blane, are still apparent from sea to sea." From this 
charter, it would appear, also, that at the time of its date, this was 
the parochial church of the whole island. The extent of the ec- 
clesiastical lands mentioned in the above grant, it is not now easy 
to determine. They may have comprehended the whole penin- 
sula ; perhaps only the part of it which would be cut off by a line 
drawn from Dunagoil Bay on the west, passing a little to the north 
of the church, and terminating at one of the small creeks on the 
eastern shore. The church stands on a level space raised by art 
considerably above the adjoining ground, and enclosed by a wall 
of massy stones rudely piled one over another, 500 feet in circum- 
ference. The whole of this space is found arched or built with 
mason work underneath, at a distance of two feet from the surface. 
Connected with it by a built passage that seems to have been un- 
der ground, is another space on a lower level, and surrounded by 
a similar wall 124 feet in circumference, which is known by the 
name of the nunnery. It has been commonly considered to have 
been the site of a convent ; on no authority that has been disco- 
vered, but that of tradition. Both spaces have been used for se- 
pulture ; but this ground is believed to have been set apart as a 
burying-place exclusively for females ; and the ashes reposing in 
it have been little disturbed for ages, although frequent interments 
still take place in the other. A considerable portion of the walls 
of the church remain standing, and discover an architecture of 
great antiquity. The elevation on which it is situated, is approach- 
ed on the north by a flight of steps, leading from a grove at a short 
distance, which contains a remarkable kind of building, of which 
the use remains altogether unknown. This consists of a wall, 
forming a complete circle 30 feet in diameter; rising to 10 feet 
in height above ground, and obviously filled with rubbish to some 
depth ; 9 feet thick, and having a passage or gateway 9 feet wide. 
The erection was doubtless formed with a view to great strength. 
It is composed of rude stones, many of them of immense size. 
The workmanship seems to be of a more reniote date than that of 
any other part of the adjacent ruins ; but its evident communica- 
tion with these, shown by marks still remaining, would indicate.

its having been connected with them, for whatever purpose. It is 
situated at the foot of a ridge of rock, running from north to south, 
50 feet high, and forming at each end a junction with an outer 
'.vail, which marked, it is probable, the sacred precincts, and which 
comprehends a space of some extent beyond any ruins that remain. 

The scene around is one of uncommon beauty. Towards the 
north, an amphitheatre of lofty gray rocks secures the seclusion 
of a spot, with whose time-worn rehcs it so well harmonizes. On 
the right, the grove with its deep shade forms a grateful object for 
the eye to repose on, while its mysterious associations carry the 
mind back to events and ages long past. Before us lifts up its 
dim form, all that remains of a pile, around which is gathered the 
depth of interest which its sacred use, its great antiquity, and its 
gracefulness, even in decay, are so well calculated to create. To 
the south is the sea, opening up, in the approach to the Frith of 
Clyde, a view of water and coast, not surpassed in beauty by any 
similar scene in Scotland. 

The place of worship for the parish has long been removed to 
a situation more central for the inhabitants, on a rising ground, 
between the bays of Kilchatan and Stravanan. The present 
church is an elegant modern structure. There is also a small 
neat church within the grounds of Mountstuart, near Scoulag 
Bay, still in good repair, that had been some time used as the pa- 
rish church. 

Mansion Houses. — The mansion-house of Mountstuart was built 
by James, second Earl of Bute, in the year 1718. The grounds 
around it were laid out about the same period in the style of the time. 
The plantations are extensive, and contain many trees of a remark- 
able .size. The flower garden is an object of great attraction. It 
has been formed under the direction of the present accomplished 
Marchioness of Bute, whose taste has adorned it with many rare 
and beautiful plants. Such is the mildness of the climate, that 
here are found, in a vigorous state, some exotics, which thrive in 
few places in Britain. 

Together with Ascog House, built in the fashion of the seven- 
teenth century, there are several ornamental villas, recently erected, 
on the north-east coast of the yarish. 

III. — Population. 

According to the former Statistical Account, the number of inhabitants in the 
parish in March 1791, was 727 

By the census of 1801, it was 675

In the work above-mentioned, Mr Thorburn states, that the 
population had decreased in number by 230 in the course of fifteen 
years previous to the year 1791, which circumstance he accounts 
for by " the town of Rothesay finding employment for day-labour- 
ers and other workmen, and affording them higher wages than 
they can receive in a country parish." Since that period, the most 
considerable fluctuation in the state of the population is shown 
in the increase of it by 148, betwixt the years 1791 and 1801, 
for which no cause has been assigned : the decrease of it by 144, 
betwixt the years 1821 and 1831, probably owing to the enlarge- 
ment of farms, and the removal of cot-houses, which took place 
about that time ; and the increase of it by 94, betwixt the years 
1831 and 1840, which is to be ascribed, partly, to the erection of 
several villas in the interval ; and partly, it is probable, to the 
greater number of farm-servants required by the progress of agri- 
cultural improvement in the parish during that period. 

The number of persons residing in villages, is : — In Kerrycroy 
village, males, 29 ; females, 35 ; total, 64. In Kilchatan Bay, 
males, 74; females, 79; total, 153. Total in villages, 217. 
Residing in the country, males, 298 ; females, 325 ; total, 623. 

The yearly average of births for the last seven years has been, 
— males born, 74; females, 75; average for each year, 21f. Of 
deaths, — males died, 45; females, 38; average, llj. Of mar-

The Marquis of Bute has a residence in the parish, at Mount- 
stuart ; and there are besides him, three proprietors of land of the 
yearly value of upwards of L. 50.

Language, §r. — The English language is that spoken in gene- 
ral by the inhabitants. Persons who have come to maturity un- 
derstand commonly the Gaelic language also ; but its use has much 
decreased within the last forty years, and is now chiefly confined 
to the aged, among the natives of the parish. The people are 
cultivated in their habits. They are, for the most part, remark- 
able for cleanliness both in their persons and in their dwellings. 
Their dress is plain and decent. The food of the peasantry 
equals, in plenty and quality, that of any of their degree in the coun- 
try. All classes enjoy a full ordinary share of the comforts and ad- 
vantages belonging to their situation in life, and appear to be cor- 
respondingly contented and happy. In their intellectual, moral, 
and religious character, they afford a fair specimen of their coun- 
trymen. Smuggling is wholly unknown among them ; and in no 
similar district, probably, is there less of poaching.

The parish contains —

 plantations, 905 1 31 S ' 

Total extent, 8325 acres, 1 rood, 2 poles. 

The plantations consist of spruce, larch, and Scotch fir, with the 
usual proportion of oak, and other hard-wood ; and are carefully 
thinned, and otherwise well managed. The average rent of ara- 
ble land is 19s. an acre. 

Wages. — Men-servants receive from L. 7, 10s. to L. 8 of wages 
for the half-year; maid-servants from L. 3, 10s. to L. 4; country 
artisans are paid from Is. 8d. to 2s. a day ; and day-labourers. Is. 
6d. a day during winter, and Is. lOd. in summer. 

Livestock. — Great attention has, of late, been paid to the rear- 
ing of cattle ; of which the breeds and mode of management are, 
with little variation, the same as in Ayrshire. Agriculture has 
made rapid advances, e.specially within the last twelve years. A 
complete system of draining has been introduced ; the most ap- 
proved rotation in crops is observed ; the use of the subsoil plough 
is beginning to prevail ; and an enterprising tenantry are ready to 
import the most recent discoveries in husbandry. The duration of 
leases is nineteen years ; a period generally acknowledged to be 
advantageous both to landlord and tenant. The farm-houses and 
offices, for the most part, have been recently built, and ai'e remark-

ably neat and commodious. The grounds are well inclosed, chiefly 
with thorn hedges, Every advantage is derived by the tenants from 
the well known zeal for agricultural improvement of the principal 
proprietor, the Marquis of Bute, and from the attention to the 
welfare and comfort of all classes of the community for which he 
is distinguished, 

The parish contains coal, which, however, has not been 
wrought, owing, either to a defect in the seams, or the facility 
with which that article can be imported. Lime is abundant; 
of which, besides the supply afforded for the whole island, a quan- 
tity is shipped for exportation at Kilchatan Bay. 

Fisheries.— The fisheries are chiefly confined to whiting, had- 
dock, and cod ; and salmon, the fishing of which has been com- 
menced within these few years. 

lroduce. — The average gross amount -of raw produce raised in 
the parish is estimated as follows: 

Produce of grain of all kinds, viz. 

50 acres of wheat, at L. 9 per acre, . L. 450 0 0 

140 do. barley, at L. 7 . . 980 0 0 

610 do. oats, at L. 4, 15s. . 2897 0 0

The annual value of the real property of the parish, in the year 
1815, as assessed for the property tax, was L. 3820. 

Navigation. — The shipping belonging to the parish in all does 
not exceed 50 tons. Craft of considerable burden from other places 
frequent the ports, for purposes of importation and exportation. 

To the increase of produce both for home consumption, and for 
the market, the Bute Farmers' Society has greatly contributed ; and 
under its spirited encouragement, still greater improvements may 
be expected to be made.

V. — Parochial Economy. 

Market. — There is no market-town in the parish. In the year 
1703, James, first Earl of Bute, obtained a charter from the Crown 
for the erection of the burgh of regaHty of Mountstuart ; granting 
thereto power to deal in merchandise, and to carry on handicraft 
trades, to have a weekly market, and three annual fairs, and to 
erect free ports and harbours ; and conferring on it all other privi- 
leges enjoyed by burghs of regality. The provisions of that char- 
ter, however, were not carried into effect ; the thriving royal 
burgh of Rothesay, with its commodious harbour, in the neighbour- 
hood, probably offering most of the advantages contemplated from 
the proposed erection of a new market-town, and port. Rothe- 
say is now the market-town for the parish, distant six miles from 
the parish church. 

The villages are, Kerrycroy, consisting of a few neatly built 
houses at the bay of Scoulag ; and Kilchatan-bay, so-called from 
its being situated in the bay of that name, and which contains fifty 
inhabited houses. 

Means of Communication. — There are no public means of com- 
munication betwixt the parish and Rothesay ; and that burgh be- 
ing the nearest post-town, the want of a post-office is felt to be a 
great inconvenience. There are no turnpikes, but the roads are 
good, and adapted for carriages of all descriptions. The bridges 
are sufficient ; and the fences are attended to. There is a wharf 
at Kilchatan Bay, for lading and unlading small craft ; and also 
at Scoulag Bay. The former is about to receive considerable en- 
largement, demanded by the rapid inci-ease of agricultural produce 
exported from this quarter. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church is conveniently situat- 
ed, four miles distant from the northern extremity of the parish, 
and two miles and a-half from the southern. It was built in the 
year 1826. It has accommodation for 600 persons. All the sit- 
tings are free ; and ample space remains for accommodating an in- 
crease of population. The manse and offices were built in the year 
1769. They were last repaired in the year 1833, and are in a 
comfortable state. The glebe contains nearly 1 1 acres imperial, and 
has been valued at L. 12 per annum. The minister's stipend con- 
sists of 47|f| bolls imperial of meal; and 10 quarters 61 bush- 
els imperial of bear; and L. 148, 6s. 1 A. money. The last 
augmentation of the stipend took place in the year 1814. The 
teiuds are exhausted. There is no place of worship but the pa-

rocliial church. The inhabitants are in general a church-going 
people. The annual average of communicants, during the last 
thirteen years, has been 281. There is one family in connection 
with the United Associate Synod ; and one person who is a Roman 
Catholic. The rest of the people belong to the Established Church. 

Education. — There are three schools, one of them parochial. 
In it the usual branches of education are taught, including Latin 
and Greek ; in the others, chiefly English-reading, writing, and 
arithmetic. The parochial schoolmaster has the legal accommo- 
dations, with the minimum salary. The other teachers have 
school-houses, and dwellings, and a small salary, allowed them by 
the Marquis of Bute ; the rest of their support is derived from 
school-fees, which are moderate. The present number of schools 
appears to be sufficient for the parish, they being so situated as to 
afford access to instruction for the children from all quarters. The 
people seem duly to value the blessings of education. There are 
few, if any, between the age of six and fifteen years, who are not 
taught to read, and to write at the proper age ; and above fifteen, 
not one, probably, of the native inhabitants, who has not been taught 
to read, and few who cannot write. A gradual improvement in 
morals has undoubtedly accompanied the progress of education. 
A parish library, established some years since, affords increased 
facilities for the attainment of knowledge, and a growing disposi- 
tion to read is beginning to show itself among the rising genera- 
tion. In the respective school-houses, Sabbath-schools are esta-; 
Wished under the superintendence of the minister, which are nu- 
merously and regularly attended. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The number of poor at present on 
the session roll is 13, besides three persons receiving occasional 
parochial relief. The greatest sum given to a pauper during the 
year past has been 10s. 9d. per quarter; the smallest 4s. The 
sum that has been collected at the church during the same period 
is L. 18, 8s. 7d. 

Ale-houses. — There are six ale-houses in the parish ; three of 
which are in the village of Kilchatan-bay. Of these last, two are 
superfluous, and likely to prove injurious to morals, as the multi- 
plication of such houses, especially in villages, is invariably found 
to be. 

Fuel. — The fuel in general use is coal, which may be purchas- 
ed at any of the landing-places, at 7s. 6d. a cart of 14 cwt.

what it was at the time when the former Statistical Account was 
written, we cannot fail to perceive that its state has greally im- 
proved. The superior means of communication which it now en- 
joys, have afforded it great advantages. At the period above-men- 
tioned, all ordinary intercourse with the mainland was maintained 
by a ferry-boat, plying once a-week from Scoulag ; or a packet 
sailing twice a-week from Rothesay to the village of Largs, on the 
opposite coast. Now, the introduction of steam-sailing affords 
daily a speedy and cheap mode of conveyance for passengers and 
goods, to all the ports of the Clyde ; and thence to all parts of 
the kingdom. The change in the food of the people indicates a 
material increase of comfort in their circumstances. Herrino-s, 
which formerly were the chief maintenance of the greater number 
of the inhabitants during three-fourths of the yearjf have ceased 
to be with any an important article of subsistence. Animal food 
has become general ; and it has become common for cottagers to 
rear pigs and poultry for their own use. A corresponding improve- 
ment is observable in fuel. It will astonish a farmer, who is ac- 
customed to make the price of an acre of turnip pay for a year's 
supply of coals for his family, to learn, that fifty years ago, " the 
farmers being employed the most part of the summer in casting 
and leading peats, could not provide manure for their farms."J 
The difference is remarkable betwixt the habits and pursuits of 
the young men of the present day, and those of the race that pre- 
ceded them. At the period we have been referring to, few far- 
mers' sons were bred to farming ; all the young men in the parish 
were engaged in the herring-fishery ; their highest ambition was 
to become masters of herring-busses ; and when they were not 
employed in their favourite pursuit, no wages could induce them 
to engage in any other kind of work.§ Their successors, at pre- 
sent, furnish only fifteen persons for the herring-fishery ; are strong- 
ly attached to agriculture, one at least of every farmer's sons ge- 
nerally adopting his father's occupation ; are ready, when disen- 
gaged from their more ordinary employment, to put their hand to 
any needful work ; and in many cases, direct their aim successful- 
ly to the coimting-room, or the learned professions. The im- 
provements in agriculture, which have been so great throughout 
the country, within the space of time under our review, have made 
their benefits to be especially felt in this parish. The appearance

of the fields shows careful and skilful cultivation to have arrived 
at a pitch not often perhaps attained, and seldom exceeded, in the 
more fertile districts of the kingdom ; and a glance at the amount 
of the raw produce, as shown above, compared with that from the 
former Statistical Account, we gather it to have been at the pe- 
riod when that account was written, will prove how great an in- 
crease in the profits of the soil has accompanied the improvement 
in its management.

PRESBYTERY OF DUNOON, SYNOD OF ARGYLE. 

THE REV. ROBERT CRAIG, A.M. MINISTER. 



I. — Topography and Natural History. 

Name. — Rothesay parish comprehends the whole of the northern 
part of the Island of Bute, which gives name to the county. The 
word Bute is of uncertain meaning and origin, though it may pro- 
bably be connected with the term Ebudse, by which the western 
islands of Scotland are sometimes denominated. The ancient 
Gaelic name of this parish, according to the former Account, was, 
Cilia 'Bhrui, signifying "the Church of St Broke." This seems 
never to have been its proper name. See Ecclesiastical History. 
The present name is said to be derived from the Gaelic Rotli-suidhe, 
"circular seat," or the place where courts were held, and justice 
dispensed. This was done in very ancient times on round artifi- 
cial mounds, which are still called Laws or Motes, in Scotland. 

Extent §-c. — The length of the parish from south to north, is 
9| miles, and the average breadth .3; miles, which gives an ex- 
tent of 31; square miles, equal to 16,1.33 Scots acres. The Scots 
acres, by actual measurement, are ascertained to be 15,998. Its 
greatest width is at the south end, from Bogany point to Ardscalpsie 
point, a distance of 5-| miles. 

It is bounded on the south by the parish of Kingarth, on the 
west by the sea which separates Bute from Arran and Kintyre, 
on the north by the kyles of Bute which separate it from the dis- 



9 EUTKSHIRE, 

tricts of Kerry and Cowal in Argylesliire, and on I he east by tlie 
Frith of Clyde. The extent of its sea coast is about 30 miles, fol- 
lowing the windings of the principal bays and headlands. If to 
this we add the small island of Inchmarnock,- about 5 miles in 
circumference, and separated from Rothesay on the west side 
about 2 miles, we have 35 miles of coast in the parish. The shore 
is in general shelving rock and gravel, and is neither bold nor flat. 
The principal bays on the west side, are, Scalpsie, at the southern 
extremity of the parish. Saint Ninian's farther north, lying opposite 
to the island of Inchmarnock, and still farther north, about the 
centre of the parish, Ettrick. On the-north east there are two, 
Karnes, and Rothesay, both of them remarkably beautiful, and ihe 
latter, which is farthest to the east, affords the finest anchorage in 
the west of Scotland. In stormy weather a hundred vessels may 
be seen riding at anchor, which have found an easy entrance to it 
from the Frith of Clyde. 

The surface of the parish is in general hilly, intersected from 
east to west by two beautiful valleys, the one stretching from the 
head of Rothesay bay to Ardscalpsie bay, and the other from the 
bend of Karnes bay to Ettrick bay. It is conceived that these 
may once have been arms of the sea, dividing what is now the pa- 
rish of Rothesay into two islands. Barone hill, about a mile S.W. 
from the town of Rothesay, has an elevation above the sea of 532 
feet. Common hill, about miles west of Rothesay, 430 feet; and 
Karnes hill, near the head of the bay of that name, 875 feet. From 
these and many smaller elevations the most delightful views of the 
surrounding scenery are obtained. 

Climate.— The air of Rothesay is remarkably mild and genial, 
which has led many to call the place the Montpelier of Scotland : 
the winter snows are hardly ever known to lie above a day or two 
unmelted ; and ever-green plants, which thrive admirably here, 
are seldom or ever injured by the frosts. 

Such is the mildness and salubrity of the climate, that many 
persons aflfected with consumption, asthma, and rheumatism derive 
the greatest benefit from a winter residence in the island. The 
range of the thermometer is here less than, perhaps, in any other 
part of Scotland, which, together with the fine shelter of the town 
of Rothesay, may account for its remarkable healthiness. 

The following tables, kept with great care and accuracy at tho 
cotton-works, deserve attention :

Hydrography. — There is a remaj-kable sulphuretted spring, dis- 
covered in 1831, close to the shore at Bogany point, and about a 
mile east from Rothesay. It is much visited by invalids, and many 
have derived great benefit from the use of its waters. The follow- 
ing analysis and note are by Dr Thomas Thomson, Professor of 
Chemistry in the University of Glasgow : — 

" In an imperial gallon, or 277,274 cubic inches, there are com- 
mon salt, 1860.73 grains; sulphate of lime, 125.20; sulphate of 
soda, 129.77; chloride of magnesium, 32.80; silica, 14.39. 

" The sulphuretted hydrogen gas in the imperial gallon was 17.4 
cubic inches. The great use of this kind of water is in diseases 
of the skin. When taken internally, or used in a bath, it is the 
most valuable medicine in existence in such diseases. It is also 
useful in glandular diseases in general." We may add, that it has 
been found exceedingly beneficial in many cases of rheumatism. 

The number of lochs in the parish is five, besides two which 
divide it from Kingarth on the south.

Geology and Mineralogy. — That part of the parish which lies 
south of the bay of Rothesay and of Lochfad is entirely composed 
of conglomerate and red sandstone ; while all to the north of 
these consists of raica-slate, clay-slate, chlorite-slate, traversed by 
trap and quartz veins.-} 

The soil is in general shallow on the more elevated ground. In 
some parts, it is light, in others of stiff retentive clay, in others 
mossy. The finest soil, which is alluvial, is in the valley which, 
stretches from Kames to Ettrick bay. It is loamy, and in some 
places mixed with moss, yielding most abundant crops of wheat, 
oats, barley, turnips, potatoes, &amp;c. On the west shore at St Ninians 
bay, there is a bed of marl of considerable depth and value. There 
are no mines of importance, if we except the greenstone quarry in 
the immediate vicinity of Rothesay, out of which most of the houses

acres additional. '

in the town are built, and the slate-quarry near Kames, which is 
little wrought at present. 

Zoology. — In Lochfedand Ascogloch are found abundance of pike 
and perch, and in Greenan loch excellent trout. The sea coast yields 
plenty of salmon, cod, haddocks, whitings, &amp;c. with which Rothe- 
say market is well and constantly supplied. It is believed that, if 
our fishers were more enterprising than they are, our shores might 
be rendered much more productive of gain to them, than they are 
at present. 

Botany. — This parish is an excellent field for botanists, and is 
often visited by them, on account of the many rare plants which 
are found in it. 

Among the less common plants in the parish of Rothesay may 
be mentioned : — 

Pinguicula Lusitanica Nymphaja alba Anagallis tenella 

Cotyledon umbilicus Subularia aquatica Osmunda regalis 

Saxifraga aizoides Lycopus Europoeus Scolopendrium vulgare 

Hypericum Androssemum Scutellaria galericulata Lycopodium selago. 
Lobelia Dortmanna Bidens tripartita 

There are various plantations of fir, larch, oak, ash, elm, beech, &amp;c. 
which are all thriving. In the court of the Castle of Rothesay, there is 
a remarkable thorn tree of great height, and which, at the distance 
of three feet from the ground, measures 6 feet 3 inches in circumfe- 
rence. Last year it fell from its own weight, and now lies pros- 
trate with half of its roots uncovered, but still vigorous in growth. 

There are two remarkable ash trees, half-way between the town 
and the parish church, one on either side of the road, with their 
branches touching each other. They are commonly caWeAAdam and 
Eve,indi are venerable for their age, their numerous branches, some 
of which are broken off, and for the mass of wood which they con-- 
tain. One of them girths 164 feet, three feet from the ground, and 
theother 1 1 feet atthe same distance. An oakofgreat size grows near 
the cottage of the late Edmund Kean, the tragedian, on the banks 
of Lochfad, under which he often expressed a wish that he might 
be buried. It measures 1 1 feet 1 inch in girth, three feet from the 
ground, and has a beautifully clean straight bole 16i feet high to 
the first branch, where the circumference is 10 feet. Its finely 
balanced and conically shaped top spreads over an area 65 feet 
in diameter, covering 365 square yards, or about the 13th part ot 
an imperial acre. There is a magnificent plane tree on the farm 
of Shalent, near the north extremity of the parish. It grows on 
the margin of a deep ravine, and divides into two hmbs near the 
ground. One of these measures 12 feet, and the oth&amp;r 11 feet in

circumference. There are some noble plane, chestnut, and ash 
trees in the grounds at Kames Castle. 

II. — Civil History. 

The royal burgh of Rothesay is situated at the head of a bay 
of the same name, on the north-east side of the Island of Bute, 
and is the chief town of the county of Bute. It is governed by a 
provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, treasurer, and twelve coun- 
cillors, and now unites with the county of Bute in sending a Mem- 
ber to Parliament. Besides the burgh courts, the Sheriff and Jus- 
tice of Peace Courts and County meetings are held here. 

Rothesay Castle, now a noble ruin, was probably one of those 
erected by Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway in 1098, to secure 
his conquest of the western islands of Scotland. A village gra- 
dually arose around the walls, and under the protection of the 
Castle. Bute being one of the ancient possessions of the house of 
Stuart, the Castle of Rothesay continued to be a place of their 
occasional residence, after they came to the throne. On 12th 
January 1401, King Robert III. erected the town, which had 
been previously made a burgh of barony, into a royal burgh, and 
endowed it with a considerable landed territory. Its privileges 
were confirmed and extended by King James VI., by charter dated 
19th February 1585. 

The town of Rothesay necessarily shared the fortunes of its 
castle in the various wars in which Scotland was engaged, and was 
repeatedly taken and plundered by the Norwegians, by the Lords 
of the Isles, by the EngHsh, and by the different parties during 
the civil wars. The town, however, seems to have enjoyed fre- 
quent periods of prosperity, having been a mart, at which the 
Highlanders and western islanders met with the Lowlanders to 
exchange their commodities. Hence, arose, probably the opinion 
which is still prevalent, that Bute is a kind of neutral ground, 
neither highland nor lowland. About the year 1700, when 
Campbelltown was erected into a royal burgh, the family of 
Argyle held out great inducements to people to settle there, and 
many of the traders of Rothesay accepted of the tempting offers 
made to them. Having thus lost, not only many of her traders, 
but a great part of her trade also, the town fell greatly into decay, 
so that in the year 1760 nearly one-half of the houses had been 
allowed to fall into ruins, and the population had diminished to 
about one-half of what it was formerly. It continued in this lan- 
guishing state till 1765, when a custom-house was established here 
for the accommodation of the Irish colonial trade; all colonial

produce requiring at that time to be landed in Britain before it 
could be imported into Ireland. The inhabitants of Rothesay 
then began to engage in the herring fishery, in which they were 
very successful. The town arose as it were from its ruins ; and 
the harbour was enlarged. In 1778, an English Company esta- 
blished a cotton manufactory here, being the first of the kind in 
Scotland. It was not long afterwards transferred into Scotch 
hands, the celebrated David Dale having become its proprietor. 
This contributed much to the prosperity of the place, and to the 
increase of the population. The mills have since become greatly 
enlarged. For many years Rothesay was resorted to by such sea 
bathers as were fond of retirement, but the introduction of steam 
navigation in 1814 having rendered access to this place so easy, 
it has now become a fashionable watering-place. The demand for 
houses has increased so much on this account, that now new streets 
have been laid off on each side of the bay, and additional houses 
are constantly erecting. 

Ecclesiastical History. — It appears from a charter granted by 
Allan, the son of Walter, High Steward of Scotland, to the mo- 
nastery of Paisley, of the church of Kingarth and whole parish of 
Bute, about the year 1 178, that Rothesay was not then erected 
into a parish. The patronage of the churches in Bute does not 
seem to have remained for any length of time in the hands of that 
monastery, as it is not included in any subsequent charter of 
confirmation. The first mention of the church of Rothesay that 
occurs is, that Gilbert de Templeton, Rector of the church of 
Rothesay, appears in the list of those who swore fealty to King 
Edward I. of England, anno 1296. In 1320, Allan, Bishop of 
the Isles, was entered " in Ecclesia Beatae Mariae de Rothesay in 
Buth," where his successor Gilbert was also entered two years af- 
ter. It appears from these notices, as well as from many others 
down to the period of the Reformation, that the parish church was 
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and not to St Broke, as is errone- 
ously stated by the late Dr M'Lea in his Statistical Account. 
" Cilia Bhruic," said by him to be the name given to that church 
by the Highlanders, is no better than a nickname, there being no 
such saint in the Romish Callendar. The minister's stipend was, 
in 16 13, described as the " vicarage and small Brohis of Rothesay 
and it was probably from this term, that the fair held in July, 
which was instituted in 1585, was denominated " St Brux day," 
or « Brux-day Fair." The tithes fructus of the rectory of St 
Mary of Rothesay were granted by King James IV. to he col-

legiate church of Restah-ig, near Edinburgh, confirmed by char- 
ter of King James V., 10th October 1515. And o-n the dissolu- 
tion of those estabhshments at the Reformation, these tithes were 
annexed to the chapel royal, the deans and prebends of which, 
still hold, or at least lately held them. John Stewart, sheriff of 
Bute, obtained a grant of the patronage of Rothesay from the 
Crown, 18th January 1591, which still continues in the family of 
Bute. 

The original church of St Mary of Rothesay, the walls of the 
choir of which yet remain close to the present parish church, was 
probably built as early as 1296, the windows being of the form 
then in use. It was one of the cathedral churches of the isles 
during the times of Popery, and was the sole cathedral of that see 
during the limes of Protestant Episcopacy. On the south side of 
the choir, there is the monument of a knight with his recumbent 
figure, represented in the style of armour in use about the end of 
the reign of Robert III. That he was" one of the royal family is 
certain from the coat of arms, but the individual cannot now be 
ascertained. There is also the monument of a lady and child on 
the opposite side, ruder in execution, and the form of the arch 
over it shows it to be a century later. The area of the choir and 
nave were used for interment by the principal heritors. The nave 
was taken down in 1692, when a new church on the present site 
was erected out of the ruins. This church also was taken down 
in 1795, and the present church then erected. 

Antiquities. — At St Calmag's, hear Ettrick, there is a Druid's 
temple in considerable preservation, and there are faint traces of se- 
veral other such temples in various parts of the parish. Numbers of 
large standing stones and tumuli are found, the memorials of 
ancient battles. There are the ruins of thirteen hill-forts, some of 
which have lately been demolished : and the ruins or vestiges of 
twelve small chapels or oratories, including the one on Inchmar- 
nock; such as the chapel in the court of the Castle of Rothesay ; 
St Bride's on the Chapel-Hill, close by the town; Kilmorie 
M'Neil; St Niuian's Point; Nether Ardroscadale ; St Calmag, 
where a large stone cross still stands ; Kildavanan ; Kilmichael, 
at the north end of the island, &amp;c. There are also the following 
castles, viz. 1. The Royal Castle of Rothesay above-mentioned, 
which consists of a circular court flanked by four round towers, 

• A tumulus on the side of a small stream near the Point House has been parti, 
ally opened, and is found to contain many human bones mixod with the stones It 
is said to have bten the scene of a bloody battle between the Bunnatyncs of Karnes 
and the Spences of North Karnes.

and a building erected by King Robert II. projecting betwixt two of 
them on the north-east side ; the whole surrounded by a wet ditch- 
It was burnt during the civil wars in 1686, till which time it had 
been the residence of the Bute family, who were its heritable keep- 
ers. 2. Kames Castle, a single tower, built probably in the four- 
teenth century ; long the residence of the Bannatynes of Kames. 
It was formerly surrounded by a ditch, which was filled up, and a 
modern house added to the tower by the late Lord Bannatyne. 
It now belongs to James Hamilton, Esq. of Kames. 3. Wester 
Kames Castle, formerly the seat of the Spences of Wester Kames, 
was a small tower of no great antiquity, and is now in ruins. 4. 
Kilmorie Castle, which consisted of several towers and buildings, 
was the residence of the Jamiesons of Kilmorie, crowners or co- 
roners of Bute, and is now in ruins. The original town-house of 
Rothesay was situated in Watergate ; and when it became ruin- 
ous, another was erected in 1614 in Castle Street, and this has 
lately been replaced by a handsome building in the castle style, 
covering the sites of both the former ones, and erected at the ex- 
pense of the burgh and county. 

The island of Inchmarnock, which lies about two miles west of 
St Ninian's Point, may be regarded as a natural appendage of this 
parish, although it is really extra-parochial, and pays no teind to 
the minister. This island belonged to the monastery of Sadell in 
Kintyre. And the monasteries were not subject to the jurisdic- 
tion of parish ministers, nor even always to the bishops. Inch- 
marnock was given to the monastery of Sadell by Rodericus de 
Kintyre, probably about the year 1220, before the parish of Rothe- 
say was erected, and it continued under the charge of the monks 
down to the period of the Reformation. 

There is a large manuscript history of this parish in the possession 
of Mr Archibald M'Lea, writer, Rothesay, written by the late Mr 
Blane, sheriff-substitute of Bute. There is also a printed account 
of the Castle of Rothesay, by John Mackinlay, Esq. collector of 
her Majesty's customs, who, it is understood, is at present en- 
gaged in writing a history of Bute, and whose acquaintance with 
this subject is remarkably accurate and extensive. There is a 
map of the county of Bute by the same gentleman, showing the 
bounds of the different parishes. Several surveys of the parish by 
celebrated engineers, have been executed at the instance and ex- 
pense of the Marquis of Bute, and are in his possession. Many 
documents illustrative of the history and antiquities of the parish 
are al;50 among his Lordship's archives.

Eminent ilfei.— King Robert III. died here in 1406. Robert 
Wallace, Bishop of the Isles, died here 16th May 1669, and was 
interred in the church. The celebrated John Earl of Bute, Prime 
Minister to George III. was buried here. Matthew Stewart, 
Professor of Mathematics in the University of Edinburgh, son of 
Dr Dugald Stewart, minister of this parish, and father of the 
late Professor Dugald Stewart of Edinburgh, was born here in 
1717. 

Land-Owners. — The chief land-owners are, the Marquis of 
Bute, who owns six-sevenths of the land ; and Hamilton of Kames. 

Parochial Registers. — The parochial registers have been kept 
with considerable fulness and care from 1691 to the present date. 

Modei-n Buildings. — Of modern buildings we may here mention 
the County Buildings and Prison, erected in 1832, which cost 
L. 4000; — a harbour, erected in 1822, at an expense of L. 6000; 
and a slip and building-dock adjacent to it are at present being 
erected. A contract has been formed for the construction of 
gasometers to light the town. Numerous mansion-houses and 
villas have recently been built alongst the sides of the Bay of 
Rothesay, and give great beauty to it. All the buildings are of 
greenstone. The freestone used for the corners, doors, and win- 
dows, is generally brought from Innerkip on the Renfrewshire coast. 

III. — Population. 

The state of the population, as given in the former Account, 
extending from 1766 to 1790, shows an increase during that period 
of 1374, having advanced from the number 2658 to 4032 souls. 
The country population gradually diminished, and that of the town 
increased in a still greater proportion. This seems to have been 
owing to the introduction of the new mode of agriculture ; to the 
increase of trade in the port of Rothesay ; and to the erection of 
the cotton mills. 

According to an accurate survey of the parish, made in 1837, 
there were residing in the burgh of Rothesay, 4924 ; in Port Ban- 
natyne, 300 ; in the country, 865 ; total, 6089. 

The average yearly births for the last seven years, according to 
the register, are 125. But to this number ought to be added for 
Dissenters, who do not usually register their children in the 
parochial books, as many as 18, which will make the whole 
1 43. This estimate has been made with the greatest care. It 
includes the yearly average number of 6 illegitimate births for the 
last seven years. The yearly average number of deaths for the 



106 



BUTESHIRE. 



same period is 133; and of marriages, both parties residing in the 
parish, 22f; and one of the parties only, 1]- ; total numbers, 34. 

There are five proprietors in the parish whose lands are of 
the yearly value of L. 50 and upwards. 

The English language is generally spoken by the natives, and 
the Gaelic has rapidly fallen into disuse during the last forty years. 
Scarcely any of the children now learn or understand it. The 
habits of the people in regard to cleanliness and comfort are con- 
stantly improving. This is owing partly to all the new houses being 
of a better construction than formerly, partly to the influence of 
free communication with other places, and partly to prizes which 
were awarded by a Society, to those who had the cleanest cottages, 
in the country part of the parish. The dress generally worn is 
the same with that which prevails in the lowlands. The ordinary 
food of the peasantry and artisans is oatmeal and potatoes, with 
herrings and salt beef in winter. Wheat bread is also frequently 
used. Twenty years ago, there was only one baker in the whole 
parish ; now there are no fewer than eight master bakers, with se- 
veral apprentices and journeymen. The population generally enjoy 
much comfort, and many advantages for improvement. They are 
remarkably contented, orderly, and peaceable, and are distinguished 
for their sobriety and attention to the observances of religion. 
Poaching and smuggling are nearly unknown. 

IV. — Industry. 

Agriculture. — That triangularly-shaped portion of the parish 
which lies between the valley formed by Lochfad and the valley 
containing Ascog Loch, having for its base, on the east, the promon- 
tory of Bogany point, rests, through the greatest part of its extent, 
upon a subsoil of red freestone conglomerate, which frequently, 
especially on the ridge immediately south and east of the town of 
Rothesay, crops out to the surface, and there, of course, the soil 
is thin and unproductive. On the southern slope, rising up from 
Ascog Loch, and towards the apex of the triangle, the soil is of 
considerable depth, upon a bottom of till, and is therefore rather 
wet. The northern slope, and that part of the valley between 
Rothesay and Lochfad is generally dry, and a considerable portion 
of it naturally very fertile. 

Through the whole length of the valley running from Rothe- 
say to Ardscalspsie bay on the west, the under strata undergo 
an abrupt and entire change ; for while those on the south 
side consist entirely of red freestone and conglomerate, except 

4 



ROTHESAY. 



107 



•when crossed by dikes of trap or greenstone, those to the north 
are composed of schistus, intersected likewise in various directions 
by similar trap dikes, some of which can be traced in a continuous 
line from the one formation to the other. A rocky elevated ridgei 
running parallel with Lochfad, which lies at its base, from the most 
westerly part of the parish at Ardscalpsie, terminiates at its eastern 
extremity in Achimore and Barone hill, about a mile and a-half 
from the town of Rothesay, which commands a most extensive 
and delightful prospect, and is therefore a favourite resort of 
strangers. 

Scattered along the whole extended shore of the parish, there 
are numerous patches of dry, gravelly, fertile soil, and in the val-. 
ley of Kames, running from Kames bay, on the east, to Ettrick 
bay, on the west, there is a considerable extent of rich, deep, al- 
luvial soil ; but the general character of the arable land of the pa- 
rish may be said to be a sandy loam resting on a: retentive subsoilj 
ill adapted in its natural state to the modern system of farming, 
but capable, as has lately been proved on a large scale, of being 
converted, by the judicious application of draining, &amp;c. into a most 
useful green cropping land. In general it has now ample justice 
done to it by the farmer. Draining, which in such soils is the 
foundation of all other improvements, is prosecuted most success- 
fully, and to a very great extent. Lime also, which is procured 
from the neighbouring parish of Kingarth, is generally and libe- 
rally applied. Bone manure has been much used for some years 
in raising turnip ; and rape dust has lately been tried with suc- 
cess. 

The rotation of cropping generally followed, and that to which 
Lord Bute's tenants are restricted, is oats, then green crop, then 
oats or barley, or wheat, with grass seeds, and then four years in 
grass. 

From the entire absence of any even the slightest allusion to 
the state of agriculture in the last report by Dr M'Lea, fifty years 
ago, it is difficult for the writer to institute anything like a just com- 
parison, but, giving credit to Mr Alton in his survey of the county 
of Bute, supported by the concurrent testimony of many credible 
eye-witnesses, the difference within that period is amazing ; 
changes having been effected, and results produced within the last 
twenty years, which, there is reason to believe, have not been sur- 
passed in any other district of Scotland. This, it would be in- 
justice not to state, is mainly owing to the enlightened liberality 



108 



BUTESHIRE. 



of the Marquis of Bute, and to the admirable management and 
skill of his factor, Mr Muir, and land-steward, Mr Girdwood, 
At the commencement of the period to which we have referred 
and in consequence of the transition from war t:o peace, the ten- 
antry on his Lordship's estate were, in common with the farmers 
over the kingdom, in very depressed circumstances. The mode of 
farming then followed left them few resources ; the alternate system 
had not been introduced ; potatoes had been begun to be culti- 
vated, but not extensively ; turnip cultivation was scarcely known ; 
and the extent of sown grass was extremely limited. The produce 
of the dairy, now a principal source of profit, was in these cir- 
cumstances very scanty; for, besides meagre feeding, little attention 
had been paid to the breed of cattle, which were then a mongrel race 
between the Highland and Ayrshire, greatly inferior to either. 
And as the high prices of grain for a series of years before the close 
of the war had tempted to overcropping, the shock had to be met 
with an exhausted soil; while draining, hming, and the application 
of extraneous matters to agriculture, were almost novelties both in 
practice and theory. 

At this critical conjuncture, his Lordship acted with a judgment, 
liberality, and promptitude, alike creditable to his head and his 
heart. Instead of hastily rooting out the old stock of tenants and 
planting exotics, he turned his thoughts to discover the best method 
of improving and stimulating them. Not resting satisfied with an 
abatement of rent on a most liberal scale for several of the very 
trying years from 1819 to 1826, he organized a system of premiums 
on a most comprehensive principle, which was followed by the hap- 
piest results ; and he is now reaping a rich reward in the posses- 
sion of a comfortable, industrious, and intelligent tenantry, and in 
an increasing and well paid rental. 

His Lordship's efforts were first directed to the introduction of 
an efficient system of drainage ; and for this purpose, he at first 
paid the whole expense, leaving the tenants to execute the work 
under the direction and superintendence of his land steward, and 
giving an abatement to the amount of their value from the rent 
of the first term after their completion. Since 1824, up to the pre- 
sent time, the allowance has been one-half of the whole value of 
drains, paid in lime. Fully alive to the importance of turnip cul- 
tivation, he offered simultaneously with the premium for draining, 
and continued it for several years, one of L. 1, 10s. per acre for 



IJOTIIESAY. 



109 



every acre of turnip grown, together with clover and rye-grass for 
sowing out the lands. The allowance of grass seeds was conti- 
nued till 1830. On these two items many thousands of pounds 
have been expended. But this is not all, as will appear from the 
following brief communication. A barrel of lime was given for 
each yard of compost made ; this is still continued ; two prizes 
yearly are granted for the greatest quantities of dung imported, 
still continued ; several prizes yearly for a number of years, for the 
best kept fences ; and also, for a number of years, the sum of 
L. 40 yearly was given in premiums for horses and cattle. 

The material used for filling drains is stone, of which there is 
an abundant supply on every farm. For a time, deep drains were 
exclusively made for cutting off the principal springs ; but for some 
years past, the system of furrow or thorough draining has been 
extensively adopted. The leases on Lord Bute's estate are almost 
all for a term of nineteen vears, and are found to be most beneficial 
to the tenant. The farm steadings have, for the most part, been of 
late years rebuilt and enlarged, and the rest are in the course of 
being so. Most of the farms are enclosed with white thorn hedges, 
which are thriving and well kept, being under the care of an ex- 
perienced hedger, maintained by his Lordship. His Lordship is 
also building numerous neat cottages on the farms, which hold of 
himself, and have each an allotment of land sufficient for a garden, 
potatoes, and a cow's grass. This arrangement is intended for 
the benefit of the farmers, who thus procure labourers at hand, 
and also for the comfort of the cottagers themselves. It is found 
to answer remarkably well. 

Farmers' Society. — The agriculture of the parish has also been 
greatly indebted to the Bute Farmers' Society, which numbers 
above one hundred members. Part of the funds has been devoted 
to the formation of a library, which now contains a very excellent 
selection of all the principal' works on agriculture, and many works 
on collateral subjects. The society grants yearly premiums for 
the best ploughing, for the best cattle, cheese, butter, seeds, roots, 
&amp;c. and for the encouragement of cleanliness among the cottagers. 
Part also of the accumulated fund has been laid out in providing 
two weighing-machines, placed in such parts of the island as were 
most in want of these useful auxiliaries to the farmer.

A large quantity of the arable land has been recently recovered 
from the wild pasture, and more is recovering every year. The 
rent of the arable land varies from 10s. to L. 3 per acre; and the 
average is about 18s. 6d. per acre.

The cows are chiefly of the Ayrshire breed, and are kept for the 
dairy. Much attention is paid to their improvement. The cheese 
made in this parish is equal to the best Dunlop, and brings as high 
a price in the market. 

Wages. — Ploughmen's wages vary from L. 5 to L. 9 the half- 
year j a woman servant's from L. 2, 10s. to L. 4, 10s. for an equal 
term. A labourer receives from Is. 6d. to 2s. a day ; a mason 3s.; 
a Wright 3s. ; a reaper 2d. an hour, without board. An iron plough 
costs about three guineas. 

Fisheries. — Herring fishing is carried on to a considerable ex- 
tent in the Kyles of Bute, and the adjacent salt waler lakes. A 
salmon-fishing has lately been established round the shores by the 
Marquis of Bute, which promises to prove very advantageous. 
There is, besides, a regular fishing of haddocks, whitings, scaithes, 
and soles, which furnish an abundant and cheap supply to the 
Rothesay market. Large quantities of cockles are gathered at St 
Ninian's bay, and sent to Glasgow by a number of poor people, 
who thus make their living. There are no means of estimating 
the yearly value of the fisheries. 

" This includes about 270 acres of coppice, consisting chiefly of o.ik, ash, elm, and 
beech. The planted woods comprehend oak, ash, beech, and the various species of 
fir, which .ill thrive well. It lias for the most part been planted within the last twenty 
years. 

t To this ought to be added about L. 250, obtained from the thinning and cutting 
of wood.

Factories. — Tliecotton mill of Rothesay contains 23,448spindles, 
and emploYS 355 hands. Spinners earn from 17s. to L. 1, 4s. a 
week, and women from 9d. to Is. 3d. a day. The workers in this 
mill are generally very healthy. They work according to the regula- 
tions of the Factory Bill. About 150 of the youngest attend a 
well taught school in the evening, and their morals are not infe- 
rior to those of the rest of the population ; a circumstance which 
is not a little owing to the excellent discipline kept up by the 
manager. 

A power-loom factory employs 85 hands. The men's wages 
vary from L. 1, Is. to L. 1, 10s. a week, and women's from 3s. 6d. 
to 8s. It was erected about fifteen years ago, is well managed, and 
the workers are of respectable morals. 

There are several cooperages which employ 34 hands, who 
make yearly 15,000 herring-barrels of the value of L. 3000. 
There are also two small yards for building boats, which employ 
about 20 carpenters, and a tan-yard of considerable extent. 

Navigation. — In 1837, there were 58 vessels of from 15 to 300 tons 
burthen, belonging to Rothesay; total register tonnage 2950 tons. 
These were navigated by 255 men, and were employed in the fish- 
ing, coasting, and foreign trade. 30,000 bushels of salt were import- 
ed, and 19,000 barrels of salt herrings were sent to market ; 6,000 
tons of coals were imported, chiefly from Glasgow. Seven steam ves- 
sels ply regularly to and from Glasgow, of from 80 to 100 tonS 
each, exclusive of engine space. Their power of steam from 50 to 
70 horses each, and their speed eleven miles an hour. Their value 
from L. 3000 to L. 5000 each. Fares to or from Glasgow, cabin 
2s., steerage Is. 6d. They are navigated by 70 men, steward's 
department included. The first steamer reached Rothesay quay 
in 1814: its speed was six miles an hour. Port Bannatyne sends 
about 25 small vessels to the herring fishing, which is the chief 
employment of its inhabitants. 

V. — Pakochial Economy. 
Rothesay is the only market-town in the parish. The popu- 
lation within the burgh in 1837 was 4924. It exports cotton 
yarn and cloth, herrings, fresh fish, barley, turnips, potatoes, rye- 
grass seed, small timber and leather : and imports cotton, cotton 
yarn, hides, wheat, flour, oats, beans, bone-dust, lime, freestone, 
coals, salt, and barrel staves. It has no regular police, and does 
not seem to require it. Its chief ornaments are, the venerable 
ruins of its Castle, which stands in the centre of the town, and 



112 



BUTESHIRE. 



close to it the town-liall and county buildings, which are in the 
castellated style, have an elegant tower, a bell and a clock, with 
two transparent dials, the gift of the Marquis of Bute. These 
buildings compose a court hall for the sheriff, burgh, and justice 
of peace courts, offices for the sheriff and town -clerks, and the 
prison for the whole county. The hall has lately been adorned 
by a splendid portrait of the present Marquis of Bute, executed 
by John Graham Gilbert, Esq. of Glasgow. 

Port Bannatyne is the only village in the parish. It stands at 
the head of the beautiful bay of Karnes, at a distance of two miles and 
ahalfnorth-westof Rothesay. There aresome goodhousesinit,and 
it is frequented in summer by strangers for sea-bathing. 

Means of Communication. — There are two arrivals of post 
from Greenock and Glasgow daily ; one only on Sabbath. This 
Sabbath mail, it is the wish of the great majority of the inhabitants 
to have entirely done away, being both a profanation of the day, 
and quite unnecessary for business. The roads in the parish are 
all local, and are kept in repair by the statute labour money, and 
the liberality of the Marquis of Bute ; consequently there are no 
tolls. These with the bridges and fences are upheld in tolerable 
repair; and afford some beautiful drives to various parts of the 
island. The harbour is in excellent repair, and admits vessels of 
considerable burthen in all states of the tide, and the dues are 
very moderate. 

Ecclesiastical State. — The parish church, erected in 1796, and 
containing 1000 sitters, stands about half a mile south of the town 
of Rothesay, in a beautiful situation, but inconveniently distant 
from the inhabitants at the extremities of the bay. It is in good 
repair. The seats are allocated to the heritors according to the 
proportion of their assessment for the erection of the church. The 
present elegant manse was built in 1829. The glebe contains 
about 14 acres, and its yearly value may be about L.30. The 
stipend consists of 10 chalders of bear, Linlithgow measure, 9 
chalders of meal, and L. 10. for communion elements. 

The new parish church, erected as a chapel of ease in 1800, 
contains about 900 sitters. It had parochial bounds assigned to 
it, quoad sacra, in 1834, which comprehend about 2000 souls. 
The ministers stipend is L. 180, and a house belonging to the 
managers, valued at L. 20 a-year. The stipend is raised by as- 
sessment on the proprietors of pews, by rents of seats which belong 



ROTHESAY. 



113 



to the managers, and by an endowment of L. 75 a-year granted 
by the Marquis of Bute in 1838. 

North Bute church was erected after an elegant plan, in 1836, by 
the Marquis of Bute, for the convenience of the inhabitants of the 
northern part of the parish. It stands in the valley which stretches 
between Karnes bay and Ettrick, about 3 miles north of Rothesay, 
and about a mile south of Port Bannatyne. It contains about 700 
sitters ; the seats are apportioned by his Lordship among the in- 
habitants. It is at present a quoad sacra parish, comprehending 
about 900 souls; but is about to be erected into a civil parish also 
by a process of erection and disjunction, The stipend is L. 150, 
with a manse and L. 10 a-year in name of glebe. This is one of 
the finest instances in modern times of an enlightened and gene- 
rous regard, on the part of a proprietor, to the best interests of the 
community, over which Providence has placed him ; and is worthy 
of more general imitation. Before the whole plan is completed, 
it will have cost his Lordship a sunk capital of at least L. 8000. 

There is a Gaelic chapel of ease, in the town of Rothesay, built in 
1837, containing 600 sitters. It cost L. 600, which was raised by 
subscription, and by a grant from the General Assembly's Church 
Extension fund. The services ar€ entirely in the Gaelic language. 
The minister's stipend is L. 70, which is paid from the seat rents, 
and the collections at the church door. 

Of places of worship in the parish not connected with the Esta- 
blished Church, there are a United Secession church ; minister's 
stipend, L. 100, paid from seat rents and collections: A Reform- 
ed Presbyterian church ; minister's stipend L. 80, paid from seat 
rents and collections ; an Independent church, having no minister 
and no means of supporting one ; and a small Episcopal chapel. 

According t.o an accurate census of the whole parish, made for 
the Commissioners on Religious Instruction, the population in 1837 
was 6089, of which there belonged to the Established Church, 
5433 ; United Secession, 374 ; Reformed Presbyterian, 81 ; Re- 
lief, 14; Independents, 28; Episcopalians, 35; Papists, 53; 
Baptists, 30; Methodists, 2; Old Light Burghers, 6; no de- 
nomination, 33. The number of communicants of the Establish- 
ed Church in the whole parish is 1962; and the religious services 
in the Established churches are remarkably well attended. 

Of societies for religious purposes in the parish, there are, 
1. Rothesay Parochial Association for promoting the Benevolent 
and Religious Schemes of the General Assembly ; collected last

year, L.126, 6s. Id. 2. New Parish Association for Do. and other 
religious purposes, L. 43. 3. North Bute Association for religious 
purposes, L. 10. 4. Youth's Society for Missionary and religious 
purposes ; average receipts for the last five years, L. 44 ; one- 
third of the funds goes to the support of a library. It pays for the 
education of twenty poor children, and what remains is given to the 
support of missionary objects. 5. Female Benevolent Society, in- 
cluding L. 100, proceeds of a bazaar, L.188j 10s. 2d. 6. Old Man's 
Friend Society, including L. 40, proceeds of bazaar, L. 59, lis. 
lOd. Ladies' Society for Promoting Female Education in India, 
L. 30. The members of these associations almost entirely belong 
to the Established Church. 

The church collections for religious and benevolent objects, in- 
dependently of the regular collections for the poor, amounted last 
year to the sum of L. 97, 17s. 4d. 

Education. — The number of schools in the parish is 15. There 
is one parochial school with three assistant teachers. The salary 
is L. 38, Os. 6d. per annum, with no garden. The Marquis of Bute 
built three years ago a large apartment, at his own charge, in con- 
nection with the parish school-house, for the encouragement of 
education, and of the present distinguished teacher ; no rent is 
charged for it, so long as the teacher keeps able assistants, and 
gives satisfaction to the public. Two of the schools are partially 
endowed by the Marquis of Bute. Two have their school-rooms 
free. One is a school of industry for females, and is supported 
by subscriptions, and a penny a-week from each scholar. Three 
are ladies' boarding schools, of an excellent description, and admit 
day-scholars also. The number of scholars attending these schools 
in the spring of the present year was 921, or 1 out of every 6 
of the population. The state of the schools generally, and the 
style of education in them are excellent. There is scarcely a 
young person brought up in the parish who cannot read and write. 

As the rate of fees in the parish school very much regulates all 
the rest of the schools, we subjoin the following list of the pa- 
rish school fees: Class I. 1. English reading, 3s. per quarter; 2. 
writing or arithmetic, 4s. ; 3. writing and arithmetic, 5s. ; 4. read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic, 6s. ; 5. English grammar or geography 
6s.; 6. English grammar and geography, 7s. ; 7. reading, writing, 
arithmetic, geography, and grammar, 8s. Class II. Latni, 7s. per

In the parish school there are 30 scholars learning Latin ; and 
9 in another school where the classics are tauofht. 

The people are much alive to the benefits of education. It is 
within the reach of all, and is greatly stimulated by the clergy of 
the place, and by the annual visitations of the presbytery of the 
bounds, as well as by the influential people in general. 

Literature. — There are the following libraries in the town of 
Rothesay. 1. Rothesay Library, instituted in 1792, with 1400 
vols. 2, Rothesay Youths, 1818, with 1200 vols. 3. Mechanics, 
1833. 4. Parish Church Catechumens, 1836, with 190 vols. 5, 
Reformed Presbyterian Congregational, 1837, with 130 vols. 6, 
Parochial school, 1837, with 160 vols. There is in the custody 
of the minister of the parish, a library consisting of books left to 
the parish by the last Bishop of the Isles, who had his residence in 
Rothesay'; and of a valuable addition gifted by the Rev. Dugald 
Stewart, formerly minister of this parish, and grandfather of the 
late Professor Dugald Stewart of Edinburgh. Among the books 
there is a copy of Bishop Bedell's Bible, and a copy of the rare 
edition of the Irish Testament of 1681. There are in all 200 vo- 
lumes. There are two public reading-rooms. The first was opened 
1790. They are both of easy access, and possess most of the 
leading journals of the day. A small periodical has lately been 
begun to be published here, called Bute Record of Rural Affairs, 
in connection with the Bute Farmers' Society, instituted in 1825. 
It is conducted by Mr Samuel Girdwood, land-steward of the 
Marquis of Bute, and is valuable to agriculturists. 

Charitable Institutions. — The following Benevolent or Friendly 
Societies exist, and have been of great benefit in promoting the 
independence and comfort of families. They seem, however, to 
be rather on the decline, as usually happens when the original 
members become old and infirm. The young re reluctant to 
join at a time when a great number are receiving aliment from the 
funds. The Rothesay Society was instituted in 1786 ; the 
Rothesay Marine Society in 1790 ; the Rothesay Cotton Mill

Savings Bank.—TQ Bute Savings Bank was Instituted in 1821, 
under the patronage of the Marquis of Bute. The following table, 
drawn up by the treasurer, will shew the progress of this interest- 
ing institution. The depositors are chiefly servants, tradesaien, 
and operatives.

There are also branches of the Greenock, Renfrewshire, and 
Royal Banks, in the town of Rothesay. 

Poor and Parochial Funds. — The poor of this parish have al- 
ways been superintended by the kirk-session, and their wants supplied 
without recourse to assessment. The number of poor on the roll 
in 1839 was 180, and the average sum allotted to each for the 
year was L. 1, lis. 6d. besides an allowance of coals in winter 
from a yearly subscription of L.80 or L.90 for that special purpose. 
Twenty-four of the paupers have badges from the session, autho- 
rizing them to call for alms on Saturdays at the houses of the in- 
habitants of the parish. Each of them is understood to obtain by 
this means what is equal to 2s. a week. This arrangement has a 
great effect in preventing general begging. 

The funds are raised as follows : 

Collections at Established churches, - L, 265 14 3 

Marriage proclamations, - -   ," f n 

Interest of Stock, L. 500, and mortification of L. 180,  " 

Legacies, - - - " 2 2 0 

Donation, - - - " ' o o o 

Mortcloth dues,' - - - -   " 

Total, L. 348 13 5 

It may be remarked, that a large proportion of persons receiving 
aid from the fund, are capable of making considerable exertions for 
themselves, and, require assistance chiefly in paying their house 

• The session purchased two hearses about two years ago, which are expected to as- 
sist greatly the revenue of the poor's funds. A large piece of ground was lately gitted 
by the Marquis of Bute for laires, and put under trust for behoof of the poors funds. 
The sale of these will add considerably to the revenue in a short time.

rents. It is believed there are few places of a like population 
where the poor are more carefully attended to, and their wants 
better supplied. Indeed, this parish furnishes a most convincing 
proof of the efficiency of the Scottish system of managing the 
poor. The extension of the Church to meet the increase of the 
population has here demonstrated its power over pauperism, both 
in keeping many from falling into that distressing state, and in 
supplying the necessary means of support to those who are in it. 
There is sufficient accommodation in the Established Church for 
the whole population ; and, the churches being endowed, the col- 
lections all go into the poor's funds. 

Prison. — The total number of prisoners confined in the county 
prison during the last year, ending 30th September 1839, was 32, 
of whom there remained at the last date 4. The average number 
through the year was 6. Of the whole prisoners admitted during 
the year, 20 were criminals, committed chiefly for petty thefts 
and for defrauding the revenue. The prison is in excellent con- 
dition and well kept. Much attention is given to the health, com- 
fort, and moral improvement of the prisoners. 

Fairs. — There are three fairs held in Rothesay annually, on 
the first Wednesday of May, third Wednesday of July, and 
last Wednesday and following Thursday of October. They are 
but ill attended, and of httle importance. There is an annual 
show of cattle, and another of seeds, roots, and dairy produce ; 
on both which occasions, prizes are awarded for the best speci- 
mens. These excite much attention, and are productive of great 
benefit to agriculture. 

Inns and Alehouses. — There are in the parish 5 1 houses licensed to 
sell spirits, and 4 to sell porter and ale alone. The number of them is 
unquestionably injurious to public morals, as it tends to lower the 
character of the houses themselves ; and multiplies the allurements 
to drinking and excess. It would be a great benefit were a much 
higher rate of license fixed by the Legislature, for the express pur- 
pose of reducing the number of public houses throughout the coun- 
try, and consequently of elevating their character. 

Fuel. — Almost the only fuel used in the parish is coal, which 
is imported, for the most part, from Glasgow ; sometimes also from 
Ardrossan, Salcoats, and Ayr. The general price paid at the 
quay of Rothesay is about 1 Os. 6d. per ton. Peats are also some- 
times used towards the northern extremity of the parish.

COUNTY OF <name ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q544009">BUTE</name>.</head> 
<p>
This county consists of seven islands, Bute, Arran, Great Cum • 
brae and Little Cumbrae, Inchmarnock, Lamlasb, and Pladda. 
The Island of Bute, from which the county takes its name, is 
situate in the Frith of Clyde, between Longitude 4° 51', and 5° 2' 
west; and Latitude 55° 41', and 55° 43' north. It is distant about 
eighteen miles from Greenock ; from the Cumbraes about three 
miles ; and from Arran about eight miles. 

The valued rent of the county in Scots money is L. 15,042, 13s. 
lOd. The annual value of the real property, as assessed in 1815, 
was L. 22,541. 

Before the passing of the Reform Bill, the county returned a 
Member to Parliament alternately with the county of Caithness : 
since that time, Buteshire returns a Member for itself. The con- 
stituency in 1839 was 380.
